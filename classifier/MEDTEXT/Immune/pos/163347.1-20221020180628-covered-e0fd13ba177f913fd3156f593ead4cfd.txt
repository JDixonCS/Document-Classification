Abstract: Consecutive mRNA vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 reinforced both innate and adaptive immune responses. However, it remains unclear whether the enhanced innate immune responses are mediated by epigenetic regulation and, if so, whether these effects persist. Using mass cytometry, RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq, we show that BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination upregulated antiviral and IFN-stimulated gene expression in monocytes with greater effects after the second vaccination than those after the first vaccination. Transcription factor-binding motif analysis also revealed enriched IFN regulatory factors and PU.1 motifs in accessible chromatin regions. Importantly, although consecutive BNT162b2 mRNA vaccinations boosted innate immune responses and caused epigenetic changes in isolated monocytes, we showed that these effects occur only transiently and disappear 4 weeks after the second vaccination. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that a similar gene signature was impaired in the monocytes of unvaccinated COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. These results reinforce the importance of the innate immune response in the determination of COVID19 severity but indicate that, unlike adaptive immunity, innate immunity is not unexpectedly sustained even after consecutive vaccination. This study, which focuses on innate immmune memory, may provide novel insights into the vaccine development against infectious diseases.

Main text: Introduction Since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in December 2019, nearly 300 million people have been infected, and by the end of 2021, more than 5 million people had died. Over 40% of the world's population has been vaccinated against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as part of the effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the available vaccines, messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines that encode the SARSCoV-2 spike protein, including the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna), were among the first administered and have shown significant efficacy (1).
SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce the SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific antibody and Tcell responses (2-4). The boost in antibody production provided by revaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine and the long-term persistence of memory B- and T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 indicate the formation of adaptive immune memory (3, 5). Interestingly, the innate immune response is also reinforced after the second vaccination, as shown by an observed increase in the frequency of CD14+CD16+ monocytes and enhancement of the interferon (IFN)stimulated gene response in a myeloid cell cluster (CD14+BDCA1+PD-L1+ cells), which is a heterogeneous mix of classical monocytes, a classical dendritic cell (DC) subtype, and intermediate monocytes (5). However, it is unclear whether the enhanced innate immune responses after the second vaccination are associated with innate immune memory, and if so, how long the memory persists in the immune cells.
Innate immune memory, also termed "trained immunity," is an immunological memory that involves functional changes in innate immune cells after infection or vaccination, showing increased response to restimulation, which is similar to B- and T-cells' adaptive immune
6

memory (6-8). Trained immunity is characterized by epigenetic reprogramming in innate immune cells such as monocytes (9, 10) and natural killer (NK) cells (11) after infection or vaccination. Particularly, the live-attenuated bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine (9, 12), influenza vaccine (13, 14), and inactivated mucosal vaccine (15) induce epigenetic changes in monocytes, exerting protective effects against viral infections. Despite these findings, it is still unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce a similar alteration.
In this study, we reveal that BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine induces epigenetic changes in monocytes after the first vaccination, which result in an enhanced type I IFN response at the time of the second vaccination. Importantly, however, we show that this effect is transient and diminishes 28 days after the second vaccination.
Results The vaccinated cohort displays typical adaptive immune signatures and notable innate immune responses To investigate the immune response induced by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, healthy health care workers with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and no previous vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled (n = 11, all male, age range: 31-42 years) (Supplemental Table 1). The participants received two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine injected into the deltoid muscle at a 3-week interval (30 µg/dose, Day (D) 0 and D21). Blood samples were collected prior to the first vaccination (D0) and on D1, 10, 20, 22, 31, and 49 after the initial vaccination (Figure 1A).
To confirm that the results from studying this cohort would be applicable to the general situation among the wider population, previously demonstrated changes in the adaptive immune
7

response were confirmed before evaluating the innate immune response: immunization with two doses of BNT162b2 significantly increased the levels of serum neutralizing antibodies and serum IgG, IgA, and IgM class antibodies, which bind to the spike protein and receptor-binding domain (RBD) regions of SARS-CoV-2 (Supplemental Figure 1, A and B), and the results of an IFN-g enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay indicated that immunization enhanced the T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptides (Supplemental Figure 1C). These results indicated that the vaccination cohort participants responded to the vaccination as expected.
To further investigate the immune responses after the first and second vaccinations, we measured the serum levels of 21 cytokines and chemokines related to antiviral and inflammatory responses using a bead-based immunoassay before (D0) and after (D1 and D22) the vaccinations (Supplemental Figure 2A). We observed robust induction of IFN-g and CXCL-10 in serum after the second vaccination compared to after the first vaccination (Supplemental Figure 2B). These cytokines and chemokines play an important role in promoting the innate immune responses involved in the effective development of humoral immunity after the boost immunization (16). Collectively, the enhanced immune response resulting from the boost immunization suggests that the innate immune responses may change after the initial vaccination.
The type I IFN response of monocytes is more robust at the time of the second vaccination than at the time of the first We next investigated the effect of the vaccine on immune cell populations after the first and second vaccine doses with cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) using white blood cells (WBCs) collected from four participants among those described in the previous subsection at all seven time points described in the study design (Supplemental Figure 3A). Self-organizing map
8

(FlowSOM) clustering of CyTOF data was used to classify the WBCs into ten major immune subsets (Supplemental Figure 3B). In the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) population, the proportion of myeloid cells (monocytes and DC) only showed an increasing trend on the day after the first and second vaccinations compared with the day before vaccination (Supplemental Figure 3C). We next classified monocytes into classical monocytes (cMono), intermediate monocytes (intMono), and nonclassical monocytes (ncMono) (Supplemental Figure 3D). The proportion of cMono was significantly more elevated after the second vaccination than after the first vaccination (Figure 1B). The expression levels of type  IFN receptor (IFNab_R2) on cMono were also more significantly upregulated on the day after the second dose than on the day after the first dose (Figure 1C). Additionally, the expression levels of Fcg receptor 1 (FcgR1) and ICAM-1 (CD54), previously found to be induced on monocytes by IFNs or inflammatory cytokines (17-19), were more highly expressed on monocytes after the second dose than after the first dose (Supplemental Figure 3, E and F). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine stimulated monocytes more strongly after the second immunization than after the first immunization.
To evaluate the enhanced immune responses of monocytes in more detail, we performed transcriptome analysis of monocytes before and after the first (D0 vs. D1) and second (D20 vs. D22) vaccination (Figure 1D). The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after the first vaccination (D1) relative to prevaccination (D0) was 165 (upregulated, 144; downregulated, 21), whereas the number of DEGs after the second vaccination (D22) was 724 (upregulated, 532; downregulated, 192) (Figure 1E). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the upregulated genes revealed many immune response terms common to the samples obtained after the first and second vaccinations (D1 and D22), such as antiviral and type  IFN responses (Figure 1F). These
9

genes, including CXCL10, IL6, FCGR1, and ICAM1, were more significantly upregulated on D22 than on D1 (Supplemental Figure 4), consistent with the data from the bead-based immunoassay of serum and CyTOF analysis. These results indicate that the antiviral and type I IFN-specific innate immune transcriptional responses are enhanced in monocytes after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination and that this response is more notable and widespread after the second vaccination than after the first vaccination.
The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine induces transient epigenetic changes in monocytes To investigate whether the enhanced type I IFN signaling in monocytes observed after the second vaccination resulted from epigenetic reprogramming, we performed a transposaseaccessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) assay to assess genomewide chromatin accessibility (19). We were particularly interested in assessing whether any changes in monocyte persisted after the second vaccination. To perform this analysis, we isolated monocytes from the PBMCs obtained from five participants, including the four subjects for CyTOF and RNA-seq analysis, before and after each vaccination dose (D0, D1, D20, D22, and D49) (Figure 2A) and detected 1544, 1045, 1070, and 1473 differentially accessible regions (DARs) on D1, D20, D22, and D49 compared with D0, respectively (Figure 2B). The hierarchical clustering of the normalized peak reads illustrated changes in the chromatin accessibility of monocytes after vaccination (Figure 2C). Enrichment analysis of all the nearest genes in a cluster showed terms related to innate immune responses in clusters 1 and 2 , especially cluster 1 (Figure 2D and Supplemental Figure 5A). Additionally, protein-protein interaction (PPI) enrichment analysis among genes in cluster 1 revealed a densely connected network of immune responses, such as IFN signaling and response to virus (Figure 2 E and
10

Supplemental Figure 5B). Especially, the modules in MCODE2 showed a strong association with type I IFN-mediated antiviral responses: IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 7 is the master regulator of type I IFN production (20), and ISG factor 3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1, STAT2, and IRF9) activates downstream type I IFN signaling and induces the expression of antiviral effector ISGs (IFN induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) 1, myxovirus resistance protein 1 (MX1), IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) 2, IFIT3, and 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2)) (21). In contrast, in clusters 3 and 4, the term and PPI networks related to innate immune responses were not detected (Supplemental Figure 5, C and D). Cluster 1 showed the chromatin accessibilities of several antiviral and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that increased at D1, decreased at D20 but remained higher than those at D0, and increased again at D22 (Figure 2F). Interestingly, we observed a reduction in the chromatin accessibility at D49 back to the levels at D0 (Figure 2, C and F), indicating that these epigenomic changes did not persist.
Furthermore, hypergeometric optimization of motif enrichment (HOMER) motif searches among open peaks revealed that IFN-stimulated response element-like motifs were more accessible on D1, D20, and D22 and that transcription factor (TF)-binding motifs associated with IRFs and PU.1 were enriched in monocytes at the same timepoints (Figure 2G). These TFbinding motifs, known to cooperate with each other to activate antiviral defense programs (22), were most significantly enriched after the second vaccination (D22) (Figure 2G). Notably, they were enriched in open peaks on D20 but not on D49 (Figure 2G). Additionally, PU.1 and multiple AP-1 member motifs, including Fosl2, Jun-AP1, and JunB, were significantly detected in closing peaks on D49 according to HOMER analysis (Supplemental Figure 5E). These results suggest that epigenetic reprogramming in monocytes may be involved in the enhanced innate
11

immune response seen after the second immunization. Additionally, they indicate that these primed immune responses, including the type I IFN response of monocytes, returned to prevaccination levels 28 days after the second immunization.
Epigenetic changes in monocytes are linked to their functions To clarify the functional effects of the epigenetic changes on monocytes, we isolated monocytes from the PBMCs of participants prior to the first vaccination, at D20, and at D49 and stimulated the isolated monocytes with R848. R848 is a ligand for Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR8, which mimics viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (such as single-stranded RNA, which is present during SARS-CoV-2 infection). After 24 h of stimulation, we measured the levels of secreted cytokines in culture supernatants using bead-based immunoassays (Figure 3A). In the culture supernatant, the level of IFN-a2, a type I IFN, was elevated to a greater extent at D20 and returned almost to baseline at D49 (Figure 3B). Additionally, the same trend was observed for type II and III IFNs (IFN-g and IFN-l2/3, respectively) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL1b, IL-6, TNF-a, and GM-CSF) (Supplemental Figure 6A), although not for IFN-b, another type I IFN (Figure 3B). These results revealed that the initial vaccination enhanced TLR7/8 responses in monocytes.
To investigate changes in the rapid type I IFN response before and after vaccination, we examined antiviral and ISG expression at multiple points. We stimulated monocytes isolated from the PBMCs of participants with R848 for 6 and 24 hours and quantitated the gene expression at each time point using real-time PCR. The target gene expression at 24 hours was not significantly different before and after vaccination; however, the rapid type I IFN response at 6 hours was stronger in monocytes on D20 (Figure 3C and Supplemental Figure 6B). In
12

particular, APOBEC3A, IFITM1, GBP1, GBP5, and FCGR1 responded rapidly in monocytes isolated on D20; however, these enhanced responses were attenuated in monocytes isolated on D49 (Figure 3C and Supplemental Figure 6B). These effects are consistent with the chromatin accessibility changes between D20 and D49 revealed by ATAC-seq (Figure 2F). These results indicate that the initial vaccination with the mRNA vaccine induced epigenomic changes in monocytes and that the second vaccination increased the innate immune response, at least partly, via regulation of DNA accessibility at specific inflammation-related loci; however, these changes were not sustained at longer time points after the second vaccination.
Type I IFN responses of monocytes are impaired in unvaccinated severe COVID-19 patients We showed that innate immune responses, particularly antiviral and IFN responses, were induced in monocytes by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. However, the biological relevance of these innate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. We aimed to identify IFN signatures associated with COVID-19 severity using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of unvaccinated COVID-19 patients and to investigate the similarity between these gene clusters and those induced by BNT162b2.
To explore the importance of the innate immune system in the prevention of severe disease, we analyzed the expression of genes associated with disease severity in the PBMCs of unvaccinated COVID-19 patients with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n =8 per group) and unvaccinated healty donors (HDs) without SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 5) (Fugure 4A, Supplemental Table 2). After applying quality control filters and merging the samples, 119,293 high-quality single cells were obtained for the scRNA-seq analysis and
13

manually classified into 13 clusters (Supplemental Figure 7, A and B). A total of 19,289 single innate immune cells (myeloid cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC)) were ultimately included, which were classified into five clusters (cMono, intMono, ncMono, DC, and pDC) (Supplemental Figure 7, C and D). We detected 2187, 698, and 658 significant DEGs between patients with ARDS-complicated COVID-19 patients and non-ARDS COVID-19 patients in the cMono, intMono, and ncMono clusters, respectively. The expression of antiviral genes and ISGs was upregulated in COVID-19 patients compared with that in the HDs (Supplemental Figure 7E); however, these expression levels in patients with ARDS were downregulated compared with those in non-ARDS patients (Fugure 4B), indicating that an impaired type I IFN response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with severe COVID-19, consistent with previous reports (23-25).
The innate immunity-related genes downregulated during severe COVID-19 are associated with those upregulated by mRNA vaccination Next, we investigated the similarities between the gene signatures associated with COVID-19 severity and those induced by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, as revealed in our vaccine cohort study described above. A total of 413 (22.7%), 184 (10.1%), and 175 (9.62%) genes among the DEGs (1820 genes) identified in the monocytes from the vaccine cohort were also present among the DEGs observed in the cMono, intMono, and ncMono in the COVID-19 cohort, respectively (Supplemental Figure 7F). Interestingly, the genes upregulated by BNT162b2 showed strong commonality with those downregulated in monocytes of ARDS patients with COVID-19, while the genes downregulated by BNT162b2 shared little overlap with those in COVID-19 patients' monocytes (Figure 4C). In particular, several genes that play an important role in antiviral
14

responses, such as APOBEC3A (26, 27), GBP family genes (28, 29), and IFITM family genes (30, 31), were identified in the shared gene set (Figure 4D, E, and F). Indeed, enrichment analysis of DEGs in monocytes revealed that innate immune responses, such as response to virus and IFN signaling, were enriched for up- and downregulated genes in the vaccine cohort and the COVID-19 cohort, respectively (Supplemental Figure 7G). These findings suggest that the innate immune responses of monocytes induced by BNT162b2 mRNA may be involved in the prevention of COVID-19 severity.
Discussion In this study, consecutive vaccination with BNT162b2 mRNA was found to enhance both adaptive and innate immune responses; however, the enhancement of innate immunity was not sustained. The genes that upregulated after vaccination were strongly related to those downregulated during severe COVID-19 infection.
Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, it was hypothesized that long-term enhancement of the innate immune response, known as "trained immunity," via the epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells after BCG vaccination may contribute to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity (32). In this study, ATAC-seq of monocytes showed increased accessibility of chromatin regions associated with ISG expression after the second vaccination, but these changes disappeared after only 4 weeks later. Thus, this observation may indicate innate immune cells displaying a form of "short-term epigenetic memory" (33, 34). In particular, we observed a transient enhancement of type I IFN responses after vaccinations. Type I IFNs play an important role not only in the host defense against viruses (35), but also in the development and maintainance of adaptive immunity, including B- and T-cell responses (36, 37).
15

Regarding the humoral immune response, type I IFNs directly activate B cells, promoting antibody production during viral infections (38). Similarly to the effect observed during viral infection, the enhanced innate immune responses resulting from mRNA vaccination are associated with the production of neutralizing antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 (5). On the other hand, persistent type I IFN production may lead to failure to maintain higher antibody titers (39) or improper autoantibody production resulting in autoimmune disease (40). Although the enrichment analysis on the gene set in cluster 4 of ATAC-seq showed no significant pathways associated with immune responses, chromatin accessibility at the CXCL13 locus was still increased 28 days after the second vaccination, suggesting that the innate immune memory induced by mRNA vaccines may promote B cell maturation and antibody responses and help develop a rapid host defense against natural infection (41, 42). Taken together, these results indicate that the innate immunity induced by mRNA vaccines may not be directly involved in the long-term prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection but instead play an important role in driving adaptive immunity, including the production of antigen-specific antibodies. However, there is insufficient evidice to explain if the short-term innate immune memory induced by mRNA vaccines remains; thus, further research is needed to address this question.
To investigate the factors contributing to the severity of COVID-19, we assessed the role of innate immunity in severe disease using a cohort of unvaccinated COVID-19 patients. In this unvaccinated cohort, the expression of IFN-stimulated genes in monocytes was markedly reduced in patients presenting with ARDS. Type  IFN is an important cytokine for the activation of Th1 and NK cells, which function to eliminate virus-infected cells (43). Indeed, impaired type  IFN responses (23) and preexisting autoantibodies against type  IFN (44, 45) have been shown to be associated with the severity of COVID-19. On the other hand, it has also been
16

reported that hypoxemia complicated with ARDS causes monocytopenia and suppression of type I IFN signaling in mice (46) and that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 (47) and nucleocapsid proteins (48) suppress type I IFN signaling in vitro. These suggest that the lower type I IFN responses to SARS-CoV-2 may be both a cause and a consequence of severe COVID-19. In any event, type I IFN signaling is essential as a viral restriction mechanism; its successful response may help limit the occurence of other risk factors for severe COVID-19 such as cytokine storm (49). Interestingly, the gene set downregulated in patients with COVID-19 with ARDS was similar to the gene set strongly induced in monocytes by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine; this means that the innate immune responses induced by mRNA vaccines may compensate for the decreased IFN responses in patients with severe COVID-19. Therefore, to ensure the prevention of severe COVID-19 after a second or third vaccination dose, activating and sustaining innate immune responses, including the IFN response, may be important. Further investigations are needed to assess not only the dynamics of neutralizing antibody titers but also the effects on innate immunity, such as the IFN response, to determine the optimal dosing intervals for mRNA vaccines.
It is important to take into consideration interactions between innate and adaptive immune responses. In fact, polyfunctional CD4 T cells producing IL-2, IFN-g, TNF-a, and/or IL-4 remained abundant in the peripheral blood immediately before the second vaccination (5). In mice, the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine induced the remaining antigen-specific tissueresident T cells to produce IFN-g, TNF-a, and IL-2 in the lung or spleen immediately before the second vaccination (50). It is possible that these differences in adaptive immunity could be responsible for the epigenomic changes and the enhancement of innate immune responses in monocytes just after the second vaccination. However, despite these changes in adaptive
17

immunity observed after the second vaccination (D42) (5), we could not detect an increase in chromatin accessibility in monocytes involved in the innate immune responses at D49, as described above. Further investigation is warranted to reveal the involvement of persistent epigenetic changes (13, 51) in the systemic immune responses to an mRNA vaccine.
Our report has the following limitations. The first is that the sample size was small; therefore, individual effects may have affected the analysis results. Second, all participants were male and sex was therefore not considered in our study. Females have a stronger humoral immune response to the vaccine than males, and higher antibody titers are reportedly induced by BNT162b2 in females (52). Additionally, the IFN-a2 plasma levels induecd by BNT162b2 are likely higher in females than in males (5). Further investigations are warranted to understand the impact of these differences in immune responses between females and males on epigenetic reprogramming in innate immune cells. Third, this study was a short-term observation, extending 49 days after the first immunization. It has been reported that the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection gradually decreases after the second vaccination (53) and that a third dose of mRNA vaccine improves the protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 due to enhanced adaptive immune responses (54, 55). However, it is unclear how the epigenomics of the innate immune system changes during subsequent vaccination and whether this contributes to the booster effect; therefore, further longitudinal observation will be needed. Forth, our transcriptional and epigenomic analyses were not performed at single-cell level. A previous report has shown that the responses to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine vary between monocytes subsets (5). In our study, whether the similar gene signatures found between the vaccine cohort and COVID-19 cohort are shared among the same monocyte subsets remains an open question. Finally, we only analyzed circulating monocytes.
18

Long-lasting innate memory is observed in tissue-resident macrophages (8). In our study, it remains unclear whether the mRNA vaccines act on tissue-resident macrophages resulting in long-term innate immune memory.
We provide evidence of activating alterations in innate immune response-related genes with epigenetic changes in monocytes induced by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and reveal that these effects are transient (Supplemental Figure 8). In the future, considering the importance of innate immune responses against viral infections, clarifying the long-term effects of consecutive mRNA vaccine doses on innate immune memory may lead to new strategies to combat viral infections.
Methods Research participants We recruited participants into two cohorts. All participants were enrolled after providing written informed consent, and the study was approved by the local ethics committee of Osaka University Hospital (IRB no. 20118-4) or Osaka University (IRB no. 734-9).
For the first cohort, to evaluate the immune response induced by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, participants were recruited from March 15, 2021 to June 7, 2021 on Osaka University Hospital. All the participants were healthy health care workers with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and no previous vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 (n = 11, all male, age range: 31-42 years). We collected serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and white blood cells (WBCs) from them on D0, 1, 10, 20, 22, 31, and 49. These volunteers were then immunized with two doses (30 µg/dose) of the mRNA vaccine at 3-week intervals according to the normal protocols of the facility.
19

For the second cohort, to analyze the single-cell transcriptome of peripheral blood cells, unvaccinated COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n = 8) or without ARDS (n = 8) who were admitted to Osaka University Medical Hospital between December 2019 and October 2021 and unvaccinated healthy donors (n =5) different from the firist cohort were included. We collected PBMCs from COVID-19 patients when they were admitted to our hospital. For the COVID-19 patients with ARDS, PBMCs were collected during ARDS status.
Isolation and storage of serum and PBMCs For serum collection, peripheral blood samples were allowed to stand for 15 min at room temperature, centrifuged at 1000×g for 15 min, and stored at -80°C until use. PBMCs were isolated from fresh whole blood collected in heparin-coated tubes by density gradient centrifugation using Leucosep (Greiner Bio-One, 227288-013) according to the instruction manual, and isolated PBMCs were stored in CELLBANKER cell freezing medium (Nippon Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd., 11910) at -80°C until use.
Serum SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody quantification The concentration of serum SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) was measured using an iFlash3000 (Shenzhen Yhlo Biotech Co., Ltd., YH-C6111) fully automated chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) analyzer and an iFlash-2019-nCoV NAb Kit (Shenzhen Yhlo Biotech Co., Ltd., YH-C86109) according to the manufacturer's protocols. This kit consists of a one-step competitive assay to measure the binding inhibition activity by antibodies against the receptorbinding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),
20

which serves as a receptor for viral entry. The 4-point calibrator in this kit was used to generate a calibration curve. The results are reported as inhibitory activity in arbitrary units/milliliter (AU/mL), and the cutoff value was set at 10.0 AU/mL (10 AU/mL: positive, <10 AU/mL: negative). All the above processes were automated, and the results were obtained in a highthroughput manner by simply loading 150 L of each serum sample into the iFlash3000.
Serum SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific antibody measurement IgG, IgA and IgM against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunits S1 and S2 and the spike RBD in serum collected from vaccinated participants (n = 11) were quantified by a multiplex beadbinding assay using Milliplex technology (Millipore, HC19SERM1-85K, HC19SERG1-85K, HC19SERA1-85K) following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 25 µL of diluted serum sample (1:100) was mixed with 25 µL of bead mixture (3 antigen-immobilized beads and 3 control beads) in a 96-well plate containing 25 µL of assay buffer per well. After incubation on a plate shaker (600 rpm) for 2 h at room temperature, the plates were washed 3 times with wash buffer using a Handheld Magnetic Microplate Washer (Bio-Rad), and 50 µL of PE-conjugated anti-human IgG, IgA, or IgM was added to each well. After incubation on a plate shaker (600 rpm) for 90 min, the plates were washed 3 times with wash buffer as described above, and then sheath fluid was added to each well for reading on a Bio-Plex 200 System (Bio-Rad). Fifty events per bead were counted, and median fluorescent intensity (MFI) data were analyzed with Bio-Plex Manager Software with default parameters (Bio-Rad) (version 6.2). The MFIs of the background wells were subtracted from the MFIs of the sample wells. The results were evaluated relative to the degree of increase in the MFIs compared to the MFIs before vaccination.

Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific T-cell responses were assessed using a human IFN-g/IL-4 Double-Color FluoroSpot assay (CTL, hT2003F) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 150,000/well PBMCs collected from vaccinated participants (n = 11) were incubated with 2.0 µg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S1 scanning pools (MABTECH, 3629-1) for 48 h at 37°C and in 5% CO2. The plates were analyzed using an ImmunoSpot S6 MACRO Analyzer (CTL), and the number of spot-forming units (SFU) was automatically calculated using ImmunoCapture software (version 7.0.7.3). The number of spots in negative control wells was subtracted from the number of spots in test wells, and the results are displayed as SFUs.
Serum cytokine measurements Cytokines in serum obtained from vaccinated participants (n = 11) were quantified using a LEGENDplex Human Anti-Virus Response Panel (13-plex) (BioLegend, 740390) and a Human B-Cell Panel (13-plex) (BioLegend, 740527) according to the default protocols. In brief, the samples and standards were incubated with premixed beads on a plate shaker (800 rpm) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with 1× wash buffer, they were reacted with a detection antibody on a plate shaker (800 rpm) for one hour at room temperature, and then PE-conjugated beads were added and reacted on a plate shaker (800 rpm) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with 1× wash buffer, the samples were read on a flow cytometer using a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences). The FCS files were analyzed using the LEGENDplex Data Analysis Software Suite (BioLegend), an online cloud-based program (https://legendplex.qognit.com/).
Immune profiling of peripheral whole blood using mass cytometry
22

A Maxpar Direct Immune Profiling Assay (Fluidigm, Cat# 201325) was used for immune profiling of peripheral whole blood according to the manufacturer's protocol. In addition to the 30 premixed marker antibodies, antibodies specific for 13 markers, IFN-a/bR2, IFN-a/bR1, neuropilin-1, ICAM-1, Fcg-RI, CXCR1, FCAR, CD147, CD44, semaphorin 4D, semaphorin 6D, CXCR2, and PD-L1, were added (Supplemental Table 3). In brief, whole blood was incubated with a 100 U/mL heparin solution (Sigma Aldrich, Cat# H3149) to reduce nonspecific antibody binding at room temperature. After 20 min, aliquots consisting of 270 µL of whole blood and 3 µL of each additional antibody were placed in heparin-coated tubes containing a dry antibody pellet and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After staining, red blood cells were lysed with 250 µL of Cal-Lyse lysing solution (Invitrogen, Cat# GAS010S100) and 3 mL of Maxpar Water (Fluidigm) for 10 min each at room temperature. After lysis, the cells were washed 3 times with Cell Staining Buffer (CSB) (Fluidigm). Then, the cells were fixed with 1 mL of 1.6% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and incubated with 125 nM Cell-ID Intercalator-Ir dissolved in Maxpar Fix and Perm Buffer (Fluidigm). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the cells were washed with CSB and Cell Acquisition Solution (CAS) (Fluidigm) and resuspended in CAS containing 0.1x EQ Four Element Calibration Beads at a cell concentration of 1×106 cells/mL. After filtering the cells through a 35 µm cell strainer, data were acquired using a Helios (Fluidigm). The acquired FCS files were normalized with CyTOF Software (version 7.0.8493).
Mass cytometry data analysis Mass cytometry data analysis was conducted in R (version 4.0.3) using the following packages. FlowSOM clustering and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) were
23

performed using Catalyst (version 1.14.1). WBC-level clustering was performed using the markers CD3, CD4, CD8a, CD19, CD14, CD16, CD11c, CD56, CD161, CD123, TCRgd, CD66b, HLA-DR, FcgR1_CD64, and CD294. To exclude DCs from monocytes, clustering was performed using CD11c, CD14, HLA-DR, CD16, FCAR_CD89, CD38, CD294, CD45, ICAM1_CD54, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD147, FcgR1_CD64, and Sema4D. Monocyte clustering was performed using CD11c, CD14, CD16, HLA-DR, CD38, CD45RA, CD45RO, FcgR1_CD64, PD-L1, and ICAM-1_CD54. All plots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.3.5). Statistical tests were performed using rstatix (version 0.7.0). The R script is available on Github: https://github.com/jonasns/tmVac
Monocyte isolation Monocytes were isolated from frozen PBMCs collected from participants in the vaccine study by an indirect magnetic labeling system using a Pan Monocyte Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, 130096-537) following the manufacturer's protocol. This kit is capable of simultaneously isolating classical monocytes (CD14++CD16-), intermediate monocytes (CD14++CD16+), and nonclassical monocytes (CD14+CD16++). In brief, frozen PBMCs were thawed and washed twice with RPMI 1640 (NACALAI TESQUE, 30264-85) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, 10500064). After resuspension in PBS supplemented with 2 mM EDTA and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, the PBMCs were incubated at 4°C for 5 min with FcR Blocking Reagent and BiotinAntibody Cocktail, a cocktail of monoclonal anti-human antibodies against antigens that are not expressed on human monocytes. After the reaction, anti-biotin microbeads were added to the PBMCs and allowed to react for 10 min at 4°C. Unlabeled monocytes were collected by depletion of the magnetically labeled cells using a MACS cell separation system (Miltenyi
24

Biotec). The purity of the isolated monocytes was assessed by a flow cytometer using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Isolated monocytes were used for the analysis of RNA-seq (n = 4), ATAC-seq (n = 5), and the restimulation experiment (n = 4) as described below.
RNA-seq of isolated monocytes Total RNA was extracted from the monocytes isolated from PBMCs (Day 0, Day 1, Day 20, and Day 22) as described above using a miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 217004) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, isolated monocytes were homogenized with QIAzol Lysis Reagent (QIAGEN, 79306), followed by separation of the aqueous phase using chloroform. The separated sample was mixed with 1.5 volumes of 100% ethanol, and the mixture was transferred into an RNeasy Mini spin column. After washing the column with Buffer RWT and Buffer RPE in turn, total RNA was eluted from the column by RNase-free water. The quality and quantity were assessed using an Agilent2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Full-length cDNA was generated using a SMART-Seq HT Kit (Takara Bio, 634436) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An Illumina library was prepared using a Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, FC-131-1096) according to the SMARTer Kit instructions. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina) in 101-base paired-end mode.
RNA-seq preprocessing The quality of raw paired-end sequencing reads was assessed using FastQC (56) with default parameters (version 0.11.7; https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Lowquality (<20) bases and adaptor sequences were trimmed with Trimmomatic software (57)
25

(version 0.38) with the following parameters: ILLUMINACLIP: path/to/adapter.fa:2:30:10, LEADING: 20, TRAILING: 20, SLIDINGWINDOW: 4:15, and MINLEN: 36. The trimmed reads were aligned to the hg38 reference genome using the RNA-seq aligner HISAT2 (58) (version 2.1.0). The HISAT2-resultant.sam files were converted into.bam files with Samtools (59) and used to estimate the abundance of uniquely mapped reads with featureCounts (60) (version 1.6.3). The raw counts were normalized to transcripts per million (TPM) (61).
RNA-seq data analysis Based on the normalized counts, we performed comparison analyses among samples by hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis, and scatter plot and heatmap construction. A tree diagram was produced by hierarchical clustering with the Wald method using each pair of Euclidean distances. A 2-D plane based on the first and second principal components was created by PCA. The Pearson's correlation coefficients of each gene were calculated, and scatter plots of comparisons between samples were constructed. Using the stats (version 3.6.1) and gplots (version 3.0.1.1) R packages, a heatmap was created by calculating the Z scores of the TPMs for each gene. Analysis of the differential gene expression in monocytes was performed on samaples colleted immediately before and after vaccination (Day 1 versus Day 0 and Day 22 versus Day 20). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in monocytes were detected using DESeq2 (62, 63) (version 1.24.0) with the thresholds of |log2FC (fold change)| > 1 and an adjusted p value (p.adjust) < 0.05 calculated by the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) method (64). Gene Ontology terms with p.adjust < 0.05 determined by the BH method were extracted with DAVID (65, 66) (version 1.22.0).
26

ATAC-seq of isolated monocytes Samples for ATAC-seq analysis were prepared from monocytes isolated from PBMCs (Day 0, Day 1, Day 20, Day 22, and Day 49) as described above. Libraries were prepared using an ATAC-Seq Kit (Active Motif, 53150) according to the manual. In brief, 100,000 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in ice-cold ATAC lysis buffer. After centrifugation at 500×g for 10 min at 4°C, the pellets were resuspended with Tagmentation Master Mix and incubated at 37°C for 30 min in a thermostatic mixer (800 rpm). After incubation, the samples were mixed with DNA Purification Binding Buffer and 3 M sodium acetate and transferred to a DNA purification column. After washing the column with wash buffer containing 80% ethanol, the samples were eluted with DNA Purification Elution Buffer. Following purification, we performed PCR amplification of tagmented DNA using 25 µM i7/i5 Indexed Primers, 10 mM dNTPs, 5× Q5 Reaction Buffer, and 2 U/µL Q5 Polymerase under the following PCR conditions: 72°C for 5 min; 98°C for 30 s; and ten cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 63°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min. After PCR amplification, the samples were purified using SPRI bead solution and eluted with 20 µL of DNA Purification Elution Buffer. The library quality and quantity were checked using a LabChip GX Touch HT (PerkinElmer) with an HT NGS 3K Reagent Kit (PerkinElmer), and the fragment size distribution was measured using qPCR with a KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina) in 150-base paired-end mode.
ATAC-seq preprocessing
27

FastQC (56) (version 0.11.5; https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) was used to check the overall sequence data quality with default parameters. Low-quality (< 20) bases and adapter sequences were trimmed by Trimmomatic software (57) (version 0.38) with the following parameters: ILLUMINACLIP: /path/to/adapter.fa:2:30:10, LEADING:20, TRAILING: 20, SLIDINGWINDOW: 4:15, and MINLEN: 36. Bowtie2 (67) (version 2.3.4.2) was applied to align the data to the hg38 human reference genome using the "-N 1 -X 2000 -U /path/to/sample_1_fq.gz,/path/to/sample_2_fq.gz" options. Samtools (58) was used to sort and remove the reads mapped to blacklisted regions of signal artifacts (68). The Samtoolsresultant.bam files were used to perform peak calling with MACS2 software (69) using the "-q 0.01-nomodel" options. The peaks of all samples were merged with "bedtools merge" (70). The abundance of the mapped reads was estimated with featureCounts (60) (version 1.6.3). The raw read counts were normalized to the trimmed mean of M values (TMM).
ATAC-seq data analysis Based on the normalized counts, we conducted comparative analyses of all samples by hierarchical clustering, PCA, correlation analysis and heatmap construction. Hierarchical clustering by the Wald method using each pair of Euclidean distances resulted in a tree diagram. Each sample was projected onto a 2-D plane of the first and second PCA axes. Scatter plots were constructed by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficients of each peak between a pair of samples. Heatmaps were created by calculating Z scores of the count data using the stats (version 3.6.1) and gplots (version 3.0.1.1) R packages. We then compared groups of samples to detect differential peak regions using the edgeR package (71) (version 1.24.0) with the threshold of |log2FC| > 1 and p.value < 0.05. The nearest genes from each peak were annotated by the
28

ChIPpeakAnno R package (72). Gene enrichment analysis of the nearest genes was performed using the Metascape online platform (73). Motif analysis of the differential peak regions was conducted with HOMER software (74).
Restimulation of isolated monocytes and quantification of cytokines in supernatants After isolating monocytes from PBMCs collected before (Day 0) and after (Day 20 and Day 49) vaccination as described above, 1×105 cells per well were cultured with RPMI 1640 (NACALAI TESQUE, 30264-85) and 100 ng/mL R848 (InvivoGen, tlrl-r848) in 96-well flat bottom plates (Nunc) for 6 h or 24 h at 37°C and in 5% CO2. After centrifugation at 300×g for 5 min, the supernatant was transferred to another plate to perform a cytokine quantification assay, and the cells were resuspended in 350 µL of buffer RL containing 143 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (NIPPON Genetics Co. Ltd., FG-81250) for RNA extraction and subsequent qPCR. These samples were stored at -80°C until use. Cytokines in the supernatant were quantified using a LEGENDplex Human Anti-Virus Response Panel (13-plex) (BioLegend, 740390) as described above for serum cytokine quantification.
RNA extraction and qPCR for isolated monocyte restimulation RNA was extracted from monocytes stimulated with R848 as described above using a FastGene RNA Premium Kit (NIPPON Genetics Co., Ltd., FG-81250) and reverse transcribed with SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix (Invitrogen, 11766500) following the manufacturer's instructions. qPCR was performed using PowerTrack SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, A46109) with a QuantStudio 7 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For all samples,
29

we determined the target quantity from a standard curve and normalized it to glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table 4.
Preprocessing and Single-cell RNA-seq of COVID-19 patients samples PBMCs for scRNA-seq were obtained from patients with COVID-19 (ARDS complicated, n = 8; non-ARDS complicated, n = 8) and healthy donors (n = 5) as described above. Single-cell suspensions were loaded on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller according to the manufacturer's instructions for Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kits (v1.1 Chemistry), using a Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5 Library & Gel Bead Kit v1.1 (10x Genomics, PN1000167), Chromium Next GEM Chip G Single Cell Kit (10x Genomics, PN-1000127) and Single Index Kit T Set A (10x Genomics, PN-1000213). Following gel bead-in-emulsion (GEM) generation, cDNA with a cell barcode and unique molecular index (UMI) was produced from each encapsulated cell in an oil droplet by reverse transcription. After amplification of cDNA, the fragmentation, end repair, and polyA tagging steps were performed. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 in paired-end mode (read1: 26 bp; read2: 91 bp). The libraries were processed using Cell Ranger 5.0.0 (10x Genomics). Count matrices were constructed using dropEst (75) from BAM files obtained by alignment with STAR (76) using the GRCh38 human reference genome. Cells with less than 1,000 UMIs or more than 20,000 UMIs and cells containing more than 10% reads from mitochondrial or hemoglobin genes were filtered. Furthermore, for each sample, doublets identified by Scrublet (77) were removed.
Single-cell RNA-seq data analysis
30

The Seurat package in R (v3.2.2) was used to perform scaling, transformation, clustering, dimensionality reduction, differential expression analysis, and visualization (78). The SCTransform function was used to scale and transform the data, and linear regression was used to remove unwanted variability according to percentage mitochondrial reads. We identified "anchors" using the FindIntegrationAnchors function between individual datasets based on 3,000 shared highly variable genes (HVGs), which were identified using the SelectIntegrationFeatures function, and then we created a batch-corrected expression matrix of all cells by applying these anchors to the IntegrateData function. We performed PCA and UMAP dimension reduction with 30 principal components (79). We used the FindNeighbors function to calculate a nearestneighbor graph using the 30 dimensions of the PCA reduction and then used the FindClusters function for clustering. We determined the cellular identity by finding DEGs for each cluster using the FindMarkers function with the parameter "test.use=wilcox", and we obtained 13 cell clusters by comparing those markers to known cell type-specific genes. To analyze the subcluster of innate immune cells including myeloid cells, we extracted and reintegrated CD14+ monocytes, CD16+ monocytes, dendritic cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, following the procedure described above, except that 2,000 shared HVGs were used. After integration, clustering and cluster annotation were performed as described above, and five cell clusters were obtained. We performed differential expression analysis between COVID-19 patients with ARDS and nonARDS COVID-19 patients with the three subsets of monocytes (classical monocytes, intermediate monocytes, and nonclassical monocytes) using the FindMarkers function with the parameter "test.use=wilcox". Significant DEGs were defined with p.adjust < 0.05 calculated by the BH method (64). Gene enrichment analysis of the DEGs was performed using the Metascape online platform (73).
31

Data availability RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data are accessible in the National Bioscience Database Center (NBDC) Human Database with the accession number of E-GEAD-551 and E-GEAD-552.
Statistics Statistical analysis was performed by GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software). The illustrations were created with BioRender.com. Data are represented as the median with interquartile range. Statistical analysis was performed using a repeated-measures ANOVA with a GreenhouseGeisser correction and a Bonferroni post hoc test for CyTOF data analysis. The two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test and two-tailed paired t-test were used for comparison between two groups. Friedman test with Dunn's post hoc test for multiple comparisons was used for comparisons >2 groups or time points. A p value < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant.

Figure 2. Epigenomic changes in monocytes regulate the innate immune responses to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. (A) Schematic overview of the ATAC-seq experiment of monocytes magnetically separated from PBMCs collected from healthy individuals before (D0, n = 5) and after (D1 and D22, n = 4; D20 and D49, n = 5) vaccination. All four individuals included in the RNA-seq analysis (in Fig. 1) were included in the ATAC-seq analysis. (B) Numbers of differentially accessible chromatin regions (DARs) (absolute log2-FC > 1 and p.value < 0.05) in isolated monocytes on D1, D20, D22, and D49 compared with those on D0 were identified using edgeR (n = 5 per group). (C) Heatmap of Z scores of the normalized read counts identified by ATAC-seq of isolated monocytes on D0, D1, D20, D22, and D49. Annotated genes were related to the innate immune responses among the nearest genes in each cluster. (D) Enrichment analysis of the nearest genes detected in cluster 1 as conducted with Metascape (http://metascape.org). The top 20 significantly enriched terms are listed (p.value < 0.05). Innate innume respose terms are marked in red. (E) Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis among the nearest genes in cluster 1 using molecular complex detection algorithm as conducted with Metascape (http://metascape.org). The components of each molecular complex detection (MCODE) are listed in supplemental figure 5B. (F) Changes in normalized peak counts nearest antiviral and IFN-stimulated genes identified by ATAC-seq of isolated monocytes. Fold changes are represented compared with D0. (G) Enriched known motifs identified using hypergeometric optimization of motif enrichment (HOMER) among enhanced chromatin accessibility regions on D1, D20, D22, and D49 compared with those on D0. TF, transcription factor.

Figure 3. Dynamic changes in innate immune responses in monocytes after induction by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. (A) Overview of the experiments. Restimulation of monocytes isolated from PBMCs on D0, D20, and D49 with R848 for 6 or 24 h (n =4 per group). All four individuals included in the ATAC-seq analysis (in Fig. 2) were included in the restimulation experiment. R848 is a ligand for Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR8, which mimics singlestranded RNA viral pathogens. (B) Concentrations of type I IFNs (IFN-a2 and IFN-b) in the culture supernatant after stimulation of isolated monocytes with R848 (100 ng/mL) for 24 h (D0, D20, and D49; n = 4 per group). Type I IFN levels were measured by a bead-based immunoassay. Each dot represents an individual. (C) Antiviral and IFN-stimulated gene (APOBEC3A, IFITM1, ISG15, GBP5, TNFSF10, and WARS) expression levels were quantified by qPCR before and after stimulation of isolated monocytes with R848 (100 ng/mL) for 6 and 24 h (left bars, D0; middle bars, D20; right bars, D49; n = 4 per group). The gene-expression levels were normalized to those of GAPDH. Each dot represents an individual. White, orange, and blue bars show no stimulation, 6 and 24 h after stimulation, respectively. ISGs, IFN-stimulated genes.

from COVID-19 patients with and without ARDS (n = 8 per group) and from healthy donors (n = 5). No participants were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 infection. (B) DEGs in monocytes identified by scRNA-seq analysis of COVID-19 patients with and without ARDS. Selected ISGs are annotated. (C) Circos plot of the overlapping genes among DEGs in monocytes detected for the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine cohort and the unvaccinated COVID-19 cohort (p.adjust < 0.05). In the vaccine cohort, DEGs detected at D1 and D22 relative to D0 and D20, respectively, were analyzed. In the COVID-19 cohort, DEGs detected in monocytes of ARDS patients compared to non-ARDS patients were analyzed. Each segment of the outer circle represents a monocyte subclass (Pan Mono, pan monocytes; cMono, classical monocytes; intMono, intermediate monocytes; or ncMono, nonclassical monocytes) and gene expression pattern (upregulated or downregulated). The inner circle colored in red (upregulated genes) and blue (downregulated genes) represents the genes that are shared by multiple segments, and the gray circle represents genes that are unique to that segment. On the inside, each arc represents a gene list. The arcs linking the Pan Mono segment with the cMono, intMono, or ncMono segment are colored. (D, E, and F) Scatter plots showing the overlapping genes identified by Circos plot. The y-axis represents DEGs in cMono (D), intMono (E), and ncMono (F) in the COVID-19 cohort (nonARDS vs. ARDS). The x-axis represents DEGs in pan monocytes in the vaccine cohort (D20 vs. D22). Genes with significantly changed expression are marked in red (absolute log2-FC > 1 and p.adjust < 0.05 in both analyses). ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; cMono, classical monocytes; intMono, intermediate monocytes; ncMono, nonclassical monocytes.
