with RCC at high risk of recurrence following surgery. Additional followup is planned for the key secondary endpoint of OS. KEYNOTE-564 is the first positive phase 3 study with adjuvant immunotherapy in RCC and these results support pembro as a potential new standard of care for pts with RCC in the adjuvant setting.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Effective therapy to reduce risk of RCC relapse after surgery remains an unmet need. Adjuvant immune therapy is a potential strategy for these pts. The KEYNOTE-564 trial (NCT03142334) evaluated pembro vs placebo as adjuvant therapy for pts with RCC.
METHODS: KEYNOTE-564 is a phase 3 trial of pembro vs placebo for 17 cycles (z1 yr) in pts with histologically confirmed clear cell RCC, with pT2, Gr 4 or sarcomatoid, N0 M0; pT3 or pT4, any Gr, N0 M0; any pT, any Gr, NþM0; or M1 NED (no evidence of disease after primary tumor þ soft tissue metastases completely resected 1 yr from nephrectomy). Pts had undergone surgery 12 wks prior to randomization; had no prior systemic therapy; had ECOG PS 0 or 1. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS) per investigator assessment in all randomized pts (ITT population). Overall survival (OS) was a key secondary endpoint. Safety in all treated pts was a secondary endpoint.
RESULTS: 994 pts were randomized 1:1 to pembro (n[496) or placebo (n[498). Median (range) time from randomization to data cutoff date of Dec 14, 2020 was 24.1 (14.9À41.5) mo. No pts remained on study treatment. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between arms. At first prespecified interim analysis, the primary endpoint of DFS was met (median not reached [NR] for both arms, HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53À0.87; p[0.0010 [one-sided]). Estimated DFS rate at 24 mo was 77.3% with pembro vs 68.1% with placebo. Overall, DFS benefit was consistent across subgroups. 51 OS events were observed (18 in the pembro arm, 33 in the placebo arm). Median OS was NR for both arms (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30À0.96; p[0.0164 [onesided]); the p-value did not cross the statistical hypothesis testing boundary. Estimated OS rate at 24 mo was 96.6% with pembro vs 93.5% with placebo. 470 pts (96.3%) and 452 pts (91.1%) experienced !1 all-cause adverse events (AEs) with pembro vs placebo, respectively. Grade 3-5 all-cause AEs occurred in 158 pts (32.4%) with pembro and 88 pts (17.7%) with placebo. No deaths related to pembro occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: Pembro demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in DFS vs placebo in pts

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) managed with antibiotics, suffer morbidity, while society is burdened with significant costs and the rising specter of antibiotic resistance. We report a game-changing vaccine, MV140, for the prevention of rUTI in women.
METHODS: The novel mechanism of action of MV140 is examined. Results from 1. early uncontrolled studies, 2. the first phase III multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT (randomized women with rUTI to 6 months placebo or MV140 for 3 or 6 months with 12 months total follow-up), 3. ongoing safety monitoring from special access programs (SAP; 2014-2020) and 4. the first in North America (NA) clinical experience evaluating the novel sublingual vaccine MV140 (Uromune) for prevention of rUTI in women are reported. Major endpoints for the reported clinical studies were number of UTIs, UTI-free rate and safety following 3 months vaccine administration.
RESULTS: Stimulation of sublingual mucosa with MV140 (Uromune), a polybacterial sublingual vaccine consisting of whole inactivated bacteria (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, P. vulgaris) induces induction of a T-cell specific adaptive as well as innate immune response at the level of the genitourinary tract. In 5 uncontrolled studies 1,408 women treated with MV140 had significantly higher UTI-free rates (35 to 90%) than 499 women treated with antibiotic prophylaxis (0-9%). In the pivotal RCT (240 women randomized), the median number of UTI episodes for 9 months post-vaccination was 3.0 [IQR, 0.5-6.0] in placebo compared to 0.0 [IQR, 0.0-1.0] in both groups receiving MV140 (p <0.001). UTI-free rates of 55.7% and 58.0% were observed in subjects receiving MV140 for 3 or 6 months, respectively compared to 25.0% in placebo group (p <0.001). Only 5 (2 with placebo; 3 with MV140) subjects reported non-serious adverse reactions (A/R). The ongoing SAP safety study documented A/R's in 1.7% of over 20,500 patients. Subjects enrolled in the NA study prior to pre-Covid-19 mandatory recruitment shutdown (n[25) experienced a 48% UTI-free rate (with overall 82% reduction in UTI episodes compared to pre-vaccination) in the 9 months following 3 month vaccination period with one subject having 2 mild vaccine associated A/Rs.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical studies confirm the theoretical benefits of MV140 vaccine as a safe and effective strategy to reduce the incidence and/or prevent rUTI in women. Physicians who treat rUTI and women who suffer from rUTI will soon have an evidence-based alternative to antibiotic management.
