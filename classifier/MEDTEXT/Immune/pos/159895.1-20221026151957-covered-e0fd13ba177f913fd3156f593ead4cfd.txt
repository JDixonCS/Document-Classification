43 Abstract
44 The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein is synthesized as large precursor protein and 45 must be activated by proteolytic cleavage into S1 and S2. A recombinant modified vaccinia 46 virus Ankara (MVA) expressing native, full-length S protein (MVA-SARS-2-S) is 47 currently under investigation as candidate vaccine in phase I clinical studies. Initial 48 results from immunogenicity monitoring revealed induction of S-specific antibodies 49 binding to S2, but low-level antibody responses to the S1 domain. Follow-up investigations 50 of native S antigen synthesis in MVA-SARS-2-S infected cells revealed limited levels of S1 51 protein on the cell surface. In contrast, we found superior S1 cell surface presentation 52 upon infection with a recombinant MVA expressing a stabilized version of SARS-CoV-2 53 S protein with an inactivated S1/2 cleavage site and K986P and V987P mutations 54 (MVA-SARS-2-ST). When comparing immunogenicity of MVA vector vaccines, mice 55 vaccinated with MVA-SARS-2-ST mounted substantial levels of S broadly reactive 56 antibodies that effectively neutralized different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Importantly, 57 intramuscular MVA-SARS-2-ST immunization of hamsters and mice resulted in potent 58 immune responses upon challenge infection and protected from disease and severe lung 59 pathology. Our results suggest that MVA-SARS-2-ST represents an improved clinical 60 candidate vaccine and that the presence of plasma membrane-bound S1 is highly 61 beneficial to induce protective antibody levels.

66 Introduction
67 All COVID-19 vaccines licensed to date include the complete SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein 68 as key antigen to elicit protective immune responses. Trimers of this large viral surface protein 69 form the distinctive spikes of the coronavirus (1). Monomeric S is a glycosylated 70 transmembrane protein comprising a large N-terminal ectodomain and a short C-terminal 71 endodomain. The full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein is cleaved by a furin-like protease into 72 two almost equally sized polypeptides called S1 (N-terminus of S) and S2 (membrane-anchored 73 C-terminus of S). S1 harbors the receptor binding domain (RBD) which interacts with the 74 cellular receptor molecule angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and serves, together with 75 other parts of S1, as an important target for antibodies that can interfere with host cell receptor 76 binding capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infection. The S2 mediates fusion between the 77 virus and cell membrane, and is also an important target for antibodies that can interfere with 78 virus entry.
79 S-specific virus-neutralizing antibodies are a major component of the vaccine-induced immune 80 response protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection (2). COVID-19 vaccines with reported 81 efficacy deliver as an antigen either native S polypeptides (3-5) or modified versions of the full82 length S protein (6-9). The modified S antigens contain two proline amino acid substitutions in 83 the S2 protein between the fusion peptide and the first hinge region sequence to arrest the S 84 protein in the pre-fusion conformation (1). Two S vaccine antigens harbor additional mutations 85 to prevent S1/S2 cleavage by furin-like proteases (6, 8). While all of the different candidate 86 vaccines based on S antigens elicit protective immunity in humans, they seem to induce distinct 87 levels of vaccine efficacy and S-specific antibody responses (10). Structural features of the 88 various S antigens might account for these differences in vaccine immunogenicity and/or 89 vaccine efficacy and warrant further investigation. Moreover, recent studies demonstrated that 90 the persistency of immune responses induced by approved COVID-19 vaccines and/or infection
4

91 is limited. While all approved vaccine candidates provide a high level of protection against 92 severe disease and death, protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or transmission 93 declines due to the waning of S-specific antibodies and the emergence of variants. To address 94 this limitation, improved vaccination strategies that could be used as booster vaccines are 95 urgently needed.
96 Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a replication-deficient orthopoxvirus vaccine strain 97 has long served as an advanced vaccine technology platform for developing viral vector 98 vaccines against emerging infectious disease (10-14).
99 Recent work addressed the preclinical development of MVA vector vaccines against COVID100 19, including our candidate vaccine MVA-SARS-2-S (MVA-S) (15). Immunizations with 101 MVA-S in animal models demonstrated the safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of 102 this vector vaccine delivering the native full-length SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. Further, MVA-S 103 entered phase 1a clinical evaluation to assess the clinical safety and tolerability of two 104 administrations and two ascending dose levels in healthy adults (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: 105 NCT04569383).
106 One objective of this study was to more closely examine the S-specific antibody responses 107 following MVA-S immunization. Preliminary data from this immunogenicity monitoring 108 suggested that most of the vaccine-induced native S-antigen-specific antibodies bound to the 109 S2 but not the S1 antigen domain. This interesting observation prompted us to construct a 110 vaccine vector delivering a modified stabilized version of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen, with an 111 inactivated S1/2 cleavage site, called MVA-SARS-2-ST (for stabilized S antigen, MVA-ST) to 112 compare with the original MVA-S in preclinical studies.
113 Here, we show that MVA-ST produces a full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein that is not 114 processed into S1 and S2 protein subunits, but anchored to the membrane of MVA-ST infected
5

115 cells. We found enhanced levels of cell-surface S1 antigen upon infection with MVA-ST 116 compared to MVA-S. Moreover, when comparatively tested as a vaccine in animal models, 117 MVA-ST not only elicited substantially higher levels of S1 binding and SARS-CoV-2 118 neutralizing antibodies, but also robustly protected vaccinated mice and hamsters against 119 SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection and lung pathology. Currently, MVA-ST is being 120 investigated in a phase Ib clinical trial as an optimized MVA vector candidate vaccine against 121 COVID-19.

136 Results
137 Antibody response against different spike protein domains in human volunteers 138 vaccinated with MVA-S.
139 The MVA-based candidate vaccine MVA-S, encoding an unmodified, full-length SARS-CoV140 2 spike protein, is being tested in a phase 1a clinical study. This involved a prime-boost 141 intramuscular vaccination schedule comparing low-dose (107 infectious units (IU)) vs. high 142 dose (108 IU). The full prime-boost vaccination regimen was administered to 30 participants at 143 an interval of 28 days. We collected blood from these individuals at several time points, 144 including before vaccination (d0), after the first vaccination (d28) and at two time points after 145 the second vaccination (d42, d84).
146 To characterize the antigen binding capacities of the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, we 147 performed a high throughput, automated bead-based multiplex assay called Multi-CoV-Ab (16, 148 17), where four different SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens (trimeric full-length spike protein 149 (Spike Trimer); receptor-binding domain (RBD); S1 domain (S1), and S2 domain (S2)) are 150 expressed and immobilized on LUMINEX MAGPLEX beads. Seroconversion was estimated 151 by a comparison relative to a calibrator sample. To examine MVA-S-induced seroconversion, 152 we used the Trimer antigen assay (Figure 1A). All individuals vaccinated with the low dose 153 mounted low levels of trimer-binding antibodies that peaked on day 42, with a mean titer 154 expressed by 787.7 median fluorescence intensity (MFI). 33.3% (n=5/15) of the individuals 155 reached antibody titers relevant for seroconversion. In the high dose vaccination group, we 156 detected marginally increased trimer-specific antibody responses with a mean titer of 1274 MFI 157 peaking two weeks after the second vaccine dose, and also 33.3% (n=5/15) of the individuals 158 seroconverted (Figure 1A).

159 When evaluating serum reactivity against the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein we found 160 markedly lower quantities of antigen-binding antibodies (Figure 1B). Only 26.7% (n=4/15) of 161 the vaccinees receiving the high dose immunization produced an anti-RBD response (with a 162 peak mean titer of 232.9 MFI on day 42), and of these, only 2 individuals reached elevated 163 RBD-specific antibody levels compared to the calibrator. In the sera from low dose vaccinees, 164 we did not detect any RBD-specific antibodies.
165 Analyzing the IgG response directed against the S1 and S2 subdomains of the SARS-CoV-2 166 spike protein (Figure 1, C and D) revealed marginal levels of S1-specific antibodies in a few 167 individuals only, irrespective of the dosage used for vaccination (Figure 1C). In contrast, we 168 measured substantial quantities of S2-binding antibodies in sera from all vaccinees, irrespective 169 of the dosage used for vaccination (Figure 1D). Again, seroconversion was estimated by 170 comparison relative to a calibrator sample. To avoid any false positive results due to extensive 171 background fluorescence associated with the S2-subdomain, we determined cut-off values at 2172 fold day 0 MFI. The S2-specific antibody response peaked on day 84 in the low dose group, 173 with a mean titer of 4206.5 MFI. In the high dose group, half of the vaccinees exhibited a peak 174 on day 42 (mean titer of 3271.2 MFI), whereas the rest developed steadily increasing levels of 175 SARS-CoV-2-S2-binding antibodies until day 84 (mean of 2928.9 MFI). Altogether, these 176 results indicated that vaccination with the candidate vaccine MVA-S expressing a full-length 177 unmodified spike protein predominantly induces a S2-specific antibody response in humans.
178 Generation and characterization of the modified candidate vaccine MVA-ST.
179 To investigate the possible impact of fusogenic activity and proteolytic cleavage of the native 180 full-length S protein delivered by MVA-S, we generated a matching MVA vector vaccine 181 producing a modified version of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen, MVA-ST. To obtain an S-antigen 182 stabilized in a pre-fusion conformation we introduced five amino acid (aa) exchanges within 183 the 1273 aa S polypeptide, inactivating the S1/S2 furin cleavage site and creating two new
8

184 proline residues (K986P, V987P) between the first heptad repeat (HR1) and the central helix of 185 the S2 protein (Supplemental Figure 1, A-C). The recombinant virus MVA-ST was clonally 186 isolated in plaque purifications in DF-1 cell cultures and PCR analyses of the viral genome 187 confirmed the genetic integrity and genetic stability of the vector virus (Supplemental Figure 188 1, D-G). The suitability of MVA-ST for production at industrial scale under conditions of 189 biosafety level 1 was indicated by data from growth testing in DF-1 producer cells and in cell 190 lines of human origin (Supplemental Figure 2).
191 Synthesis of the stabilized ST antigen in MVA-ST infected cell cultures was demonstrated by 192 Western blot analysis, which confirmed the absence of proteolytic cleavage. A single protein 193 band with a molecular mass of 190 kDa was detected in cells infected with MVA-ST using 194 either S1- or S2-specific monoclonal antibodies (Figure 2, A and B). In contrast, lysates from 195 cells infected with the original recombinant virus MVA-S contained additional protein bands 196 that migrated at molecular masses corresponding to the sizes of the S1 and S2 cleavage 197 products.
198 Next, we used immunofluorescence staining with S2-specific primary antibodies to assess cell 199 surface expression and trafficking of the different S proteins in Vero cells infected with MVA200 ST compared to cells infected with MVA-S (Figure 2C). Similar to our findings with MVA-S, 201 we observed a reticular pattern with juxtanuclear accumulation of the stabilized S protein in 202 permeabilized and MVA-ST infected cells. Immunostaining without cell permeabilization 203 specifically revealed abundant S2 protein on the cell surface of either MVA-S or MVA-ST 204 infected cells.
205 To comparatively analyze and quantify predicted cellular localization of the S1 and S2 subunits 206 by confocal microscopy, we infected Huh-7 cells with either MVA-S or MVA-ST (Figure 2, D 207 and E). Infected cells were fixed 18 hpi and S located at the cell surface was labeled prior to 208 fixation using an anti-S1 human-derived monoclonal antibody (18). Subsequently, cells were
9

209 fixed, permeabilized and total S was labeled using an anti-S2 antibody from mouse and 210 secondary Alexa Fluor 488-/594-conjugated antibodies (18). As anticipated, we saw a similar 211 staining pattern for both recombinant viruses using S2-specific antibodies, indicating 212 comparable amounts of S2 protein on the cell surface of both MVA-S and MVA-ST infected 213 cells.
214 In MVA-ST infected cells, the S1-specific immunostaining also revealed ample amounts of S1 215 protein on the cell surface. Surprisingly, and in contrast, we observed significantly lower levels 216 of S1-specific cell surface staining in MVA-S-infected cells (Figure 2, D and E). Likewise, 217 analyzing infected cells for S1 cell surface expression using immunostaining and FACS 218 analysis detected significantly lower levels of S1 cell surface expression in cells infected with 219 MVA-S (14.4%), in contrast to S1-specific staining in 34.5% of viable human A549 cells 220 infected with MVA-ST. This was also confirmed when analyzing the fold change in S1 MFI 221 relative to mock in the live cell compartment (0.61-fold change for MVA-S, 2.40-fold change 222 for MVA-ST, Figure 2F).
223 MVA-ST induced S-specific immune responses in BALB/c mice.
224 To comparatively assess vaccine safety and immunogenicity, we vaccinated BALB/c mice 225 intramuscularly with 108 PFU of MVA-S or MVA-ST using a 21-day interval prime-boost 226 schedule (Supplemental Figure 3).
227 The induction of S-binding antibodies was analyzed by ELISA using different SARS-CoV-2-S 228 polypeptides as target antigens (full-length S, RBD, S1, or S2) (Figure 3, A-D). Initially, we 229 confirmed seroconversion by ELISA using wells coated with purified trimeric S protein. 230 Seroconversion was detected in 100% of vaccinated mice after prime-boost vaccination, with a 231 mean titer of 1:1125 for MVA-S and 1:1200 for MVA-ST (Figure 3A). All MVA-ST 232 immunized mice already mounted antibodies binding to RBD on day 18, with a mean titer of
10

233 1:1500 (Figure 3B). Only 16.7% (n=1/6) of MVA-S vaccinated animals produced measurable 234 amounts of RBD-specific antibodies, with a titer of 1:300. Boost vaccination on day 21 resulted 235 in lower levels of RBD-specific antibodies following MVA-S vaccination, with a mean titer of 236 1:1850, than the significantly increased levels induced by MVA-ST vaccination (mean titer of 237 1:30375).
238 In S1-ELISA assays, we found no or only low-level responses in sera of vaccinated mice after 239 prime immunization (Figure 3C). 37.5% (n=3/8) of mice vaccinated with MVA-ST mounted 240 S1-binding antibodies with a mean titer of 1:100. However, substantial levels of S1-binding 241 antibodies developed after the boost vaccination with MVA-ST, with a mean titer of 1:6075; in 242 contrast, mice that received MVA-S developed a significantly lower titer of 1:337. Marginal 243 levels of antibodies binding to S2-protein were measured after a single vaccination with MVA244 S or MVA-ST (Figure 3D). Boost vaccination significantly increased the amounts of S2245 binding antibodies for both candidate vaccines, with a mean titer of 1:728 for MVA-ST and 246 1:1350 for MVA-S vaccinated animals.
247 In addition, we analyzed antibody binding capacity against the Beta variant of SARS-CoV-2 248 using ELISA plates coated with synthetic Beta SARS-CoV-2 S-protein (Figure 3E). A single 249 MVA-S vaccination did not result in obvious levels of binding antibodies, whereas mice 250 vaccinated with MVA-ST mounted detectable levels of binding antibodies with a mean titer of 251 1:143. After boost vaccination, MVA-S vaccinated mice did show activation of antibodies 252 specific for the Beta variant spike protein, with a mean titer of 1:116. However, MVA-ST 253 booster immunization significantly increased these antibody levels, with mean titers of 1:3825.
254 To evaluate neutralizing antibodies, we performed PRNT50 as well as VNT100 assays (Figure 255 4). Immunization with MVA-S induced low levels of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS256 CoV-2 isolate Germany/BavPat1/2020 (henceforth called SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1), reaching a 257 mean titer of 1:3437 in the more sensitive PRNT50 assay and a mean titer of 1:81 in the more
11

258 demanding VNT100 assay (Figure 4, A and B). In comparison, MVA-ST prime-boost 259 vaccination resulted in significantly better SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 neutralization, with mean 260 titers of 1:6400 in PRNT50 and 1:848 in VNT100 assays (Figure 4, A and B).
261 Our candidate vaccines are based on the spike protein sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate 262 Wuhan HU-1 from 2020 (15). Thus, we used the mouse sera generated above to evaluate the 263 capacity of the antibody responses to neutralize infections with SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha 264 (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351) and Zeta (P.2) using the VNT100 assay (Figure 4C). Similar to previous 265 findings using this assay, MVA-S vaccination resulted in low levels of detectable neutralizing 266 antibodies against the original SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 (geometric mean titer 31). In accordance 267 with these results, only a few mice mounted neutralizing responses against the SARS-CoV-2 268 variants Alpha (2/6, mean titer of 1:46), Beta (1/6, mean titer of 1:8) and Zeta (1/6, mean titer 269 1:31). In sharp contrast, MVA-ST vaccination elicited robust levels of circulating antibodies 270 that neutralized the original SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 (6/6, mean titer of 1:1874) and the variant 271 viruses Alpha (6/6, mean titer of 1:1761), Beta (6/6, mean titer of 1:1002) and Zeta (6/6, mean 272 titer of 1:824).
273 To characterize the neutralizing capacities against the more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants Delta 274 (B.1.617.2) and the highly contagious Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), we again performed prime275 boost vaccination in BALB/c mice as above (Figure 4, D and E). Control mice that had been 276 either mock or non-recombinant MVA vaccinated did not mount any neutralizing antibodies 277 against Delta or Omicron. MVA-S vaccinated mice mounted low levels of Delta neutralizing 278 antibodies with a mean titer of 1:90. In contrast MVA-ST vaccination resulted in robust 279 activation of Delta neutralizing antibodies with a mean titer of 1:275. When analyzing 280 neutralization against Omicron, MVA-S vaccinated mice showed low titers resulting in a mean 281 titer of 1:8, compared to MVA-ST vaccinated mice, with a mean of 1:184. To ensure 282 comparability with the BALB/c vaccination experiments above, PRNT50 against the BavPat1
12

283 isolate was performed (Supplemental Figure 4). Altogether, these results indicate that 284 immunization with MVA-ST induces a superior anti-SARS-CoV-2-S humoral response 285 resulting in the generation of cross-neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2-S antibodies against all the 286 variants tested so far: Alpha, Beta, Zeta, Delta and Omicron.
287 To characterize the activation of SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immunity following prime288 boost vaccination in BALB/c mice, we monitored S1 epitope-specific CD8+ T cells using IFN289  ELISPOT assays and FACS analysis (Figure 5). Boost vaccinations with MVA-S activated 290 substantial numbers of S268-276 epitope-specific CD8+ T cells with mean numbers of 1571 IFN291  spot forming cells (SFC) in 106 splenocytes (Figure 5A). Comparable results were obtained 292 for boost vaccinations with MVA-ST (mean of 1349 IFN- SFC; Figure 5A). In agreement with 293 these data, FACS analysis of T cells stimulated in vitro with peptide S268-276 and stained for 294 intracellular IFN- showed robust frequencies of IFN- positive CD8+ T cells in splenocytes 295 from mice immunized with MVA-S (means of 1.51%) or MVA-ST (means of 1.53%) compared 296 to mock-vaccinated control mice (means of 0.01%) (Figure 5, B and C). Substantial numbers 297 of the activated IFN-+ CD8+ T cells also co-expressed TNF- (81% for MVA-S and 79% for 298 MVA-ST; Figure 5D). Of note, mice immunized with MVA-S or MVA-ST mounted similar 299 levels of SARS-2-S-specific CD8+ T cells and MVA-specific CD8+ T cells (Supplemental 300 Figure 5).
301 Protective capacity of MVA-S and MVA-ST upon SARS-CoV-2 respiratory challenge in 302 Syrian hamsters.
303 To further investigate the impact of prime-boost immunization against SARS-CoV-2-induced 304 disease, we used Syrian hamsters as a well-established preclinical model for efficacy testing 305 (Figure 6 and Figure 7). Two cohorts of hamsters were vaccinated within a 21-day interval 306 twice intramuscularly with 108 PFU candidate vaccine in each case, comparing MVA and 307 MVA-S then MVA and MVA-ST. Safety and immunogenicity were analyzed as established
13

308 before (Supplemental Figure 6). SARS-CoV-2-binding antibodies were analyzed by different 309 ELISA assays specific for trimeric S protein or S1 subunit antigen. Immunizations with non310 recombinant vector elicited no detectable S-specific antibodies in control hamsters (MVA; 311 Figure 6A). However, antibodies specific to trimeric S proteins could be detected in all hamsters 312 vaccinated with MVA-S (mean titer 1: 700) or MVA-ST (mean titer 1:728) already after single 313 vaccination. Boost vaccinations further increased the levels, resulting in comparable titers of 314 1:2250 for MVA-S and 1:1157 for MVA-ST vaccination. 315 Underlining the mouse model results, we observed a different pattern for vaccine-induced S1316 binding antibodies. Only 37.5% (n=3/8) of MVA-S vaccinated hamsters mounted S1-binding 317 antibodies after the first immunization (mean titer of 1:38), while boost vaccinations elicited 318 low-level seroconversion in 87.5% (n=7/8) of MVA-S vaccinated animals (mean titer of 1:112). 319 In sharp contrast, prime MVA-ST vaccination induced high levels of S1-binding antibodies 320 (100% seroconversion, mean titer of 1:2442), and boost vaccination on day 21 further increased 321 these levels to a mean titer of 1:4242 (Figure 6B). 322 Similarly, after prime immunization we measured low levels of SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1323 neutralizing antibodies in sera from 87.5% (n=7/8) of MVA-S vaccinated hamsters (mean titer 324 of 1:65, Figure 6C), whereas all hamsters immunized with MVA-ST mounted readily detectable 325 neutralizing antibodies (100% seroconversion) with an average titer of 1:321 PRNT50 at 3 326 weeks after priming (Figure 6C). 327 Compared to SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1, reduced neutralizing activity against Delta and Omicron 328 were measured. MVA-S vaccination resulted in marginal antibody titers neutralizing Delta 329 (mean titer of 1:71, Figure 6D). No detectable titers against Omicron were measured after prime 330 MVA-S vaccination (Figure 6E). Hamsters that had been vaccinated with MVA-ST mounted a 331 mean titer of 1:185.7 against Delta (Figure 6D) and a titer below the detection limit against 332 Omicron (mean titer of 1:33.9, Figure 6E). After the boost vaccination, sera from all MVA-S 333 vaccinated hamsters (100% seroconversion) revealed low neutralizing activity with minor titers
14

334 of about 1:100 PRNT50 against SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 (Figure 6C). One out of 7 animals 335 confirmed seroconversion against Delta, exhibiting a mean titer of 1:67 after boost vaccination 336 (Figure 6D). In MVA-S vaccinated animals no seroconversion was detected against Omicron 337 (Figure 6E). In contrast, in all sera from hamsters vaccinated with MVA-ST we detected 338 increased amounts of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 after 339 the boost immunization, with a mean titer of 1:529 PRNT50 (Figure 6C). For Delta a mean titer 340 of 1:500 was measured in these vaccinated animals (100% seroconversion, Figure 6D), whereas 341 no obvious titers of Omicron neutralizing antibodies were detected in MVA-ST animals (mean 342 titer of 1:46, Figure 6E). 343 Four weeks after the boost immunization, the animals were intranasally infected with 104 344 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 (Figure 7). Starting on day 3, MVA vaccinated control hamsters 345 demonstrated reduced body weights, and at 6 dpi all animals had lost approximately 10% of 346 their initial body weight. No body weight loss could be detected for hamsters immunized with 347 MVA-S or MVA-ST (Figure 7A). Control animals also showed characteristic clinical 348 symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 respiratory tract infection, including labored 349 breathing, reduced activity and scruffy fur. No MVA-S or MVA-ST vaccinated animals showed 350 any signs of clinical disease (Figure 7B). 351 To evaluate virus loads and pathological changes in lung tissues, we euthanized all animals at 352 6 dpi. Blood and swab samples were taken at necropsy, and lungs were harvested for further 353 analysis. Substantial amounts of viral RNA were detected in oropharyngeal swabs of control 354 animals (mean of 7.7x103 RNA copy numbers/µl, Figure 7C). Swab samples from hamsters 355 vaccinated with MVA-S contained marginally reduced levels of viral RNA (on average 3x103 356 RNA copy numbers/µl), whereas swabs from animals vaccinated with MVA-ST contained 357 significantly reduced levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (mean of 1.6x103 RNA copy numbers/µl, 358 Figure 7C).
15

359 Correspondingly, lung tissues from control hamsters harbored infectious SARS-CoV-2 (mean 360 of 2.9x103 TCID50/gram lung tissue; Figure 7D), whereas no infectious SARS-CoV-2 was 361 detected in the lungs of vaccinated hamsters (with the exception of tissue from one MVA-S 362 vaccinated animal containing 5.6x102 TCID50/gram lung tissue). These data were confirmed by 363 real-time RT-PCR analysis of virus RNA loads. In lung tissues from both MVA-S and MVA364 ST-immunized animals, we found lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA compared to control 365 hamsters (<3x101genome equivalents/ng total RNA; Figure 7E). 366 Only after SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 infection we did detect SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies in 367 control (MVA) hamsters with a mean titer of 1:16883 for S specific antibodies and 1:5600 for 368 S1 binding antibodies (Supplemental Figure 7, A and B). Thus, although all the control 369 hamsters became moribund, we observed detectable titers of SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 370 neutralizing antibodies that averaged to 1:632 by PRNT50 after challenge infection (Figure 7F). 371 Against Delta an average mean titer of 1:1013 was measured in control MVA-vaccinated 372 hamsters (Figure 7G). Lower titers reaching a mean of 1:204 were present against Omicron 373 detected by PRNT50 (Figure 7H). In line with data from viral load and clinical disease outcome, 374 we detected markedly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2-S specific antibodies in sera from 375 immunized hamsters. After challenge, we measured substantial levels of S binding antibodies 376 with mean titers of 1:38185 or 1:50194 after MVA-S or MVA-ST immunization (Supplemental 377 Figure 7B). S1 binding antibodies in MVA-S vaccinated hamsters reached a mean titer of 378 1:23528; MVA-ST vaccinated hamsters had a higher mean titer of 1:72900 (Supplemental 379 Figure 7A). MVA-S vaccination resulted in SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 neutralizing activities with 380 average PRNT50 titers of 1:1200, compared to MVA-ST mean titers of 1:1771 (Figure 7F). In 381 MVA-S vaccinated hamsters, a mean titer of 1:1475 against Delta and 1:468 against Omicron 382 were detected (Figure 7, G and H). After MVA-ST vaccination, hamsters mounted mean titers 383 of 1:1714 neutralizing Delta and 1:714 against Omicron (Figure 7, G and H).
16

384 To evaluate lung pathology in vaccinated and infected animals, we performed histological 385 analysis of hematoxylin and eosin-stained lung sections (Figure 8). Control hamsters (MVA) 386 had large areas of lung consolidation. Alveolar lesions were characterized by the accumulation 387 of neutrophils and mononuclear cells that expanded alveolar septae and filled alveolar lumina 388 (Figure 8, A and E). Inflammation was associated with necrosis of alveolar epithelia, fibrin 389 exudation and a prominent pneumocyte type II hyperplasia. A mixed inflammatory infiltrate, 390 epithelial degeneration and hyperplasia were found in bronchi and bronchioli. In addition, 391 animals showed marked vascular lesions, characterized by endothelial hypertrophy, 392 endothelialitis, mural and perivascular infiltrates, loss of vascular wall integrity, and 393 perivascular edema. 394 MVA-S vaccinated hamsters also revealed areas of inflammation and consolidation, although 395 the overall extent of alveolar, bronchial/bronchiolar and vascular lesions was less than in control 396 animals (Figure 8C). Lungs of MVA-ST vaccinated hamsters showed negligible or markedly 397 reduced lung pathology (Figure 8G). Almost all the animals in this group demonstrated only 398 mild to moderate inflammatory lesions confined to the airways and some vessels, while alveolar 399 lesions were absent or minimal, affecting less than 1% of the lung lobes. Only one animal 400 showed higher lesion scores in the alveolar and vascular compartment, affecting below 25% of 401 the entire lobe. 402 Semiquantitative scoring of alveolar, airway and vascular lesions showed a significant 403 reduction in all parameters in animals vaccinated with recombinant MVA vaccines compared 404 to the control group (Figure 8I). Importantly, MVA-ST vaccinated hamsters showed 405 substantially lower inflammation scores than MVA-S vaccinated animals. Using 406 immunohistochemistry, SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was detected in the lungs of all control 407 hamsters, but in none of the MVA-S or MVA-ST immunized animals (Figure 8, J and K). 408 MVA-S or MVA-ST vaccination provides protection from lethal SARS-CoV-2 disease 409 outcomes in K18-hACE2 mice.
17

410 To evaluate immunogenicity and protective efficacy in a lethal animal model, we used K18411 hACE2 mice. K18-hACE2 mice are highly susceptible to intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection 412 characterized through high viral loads in the lungs, severe interstitial pneumonia, and death by 413 day 6 or 8 post inoculation. Mice were vaccinated with MVA, MVA-S or MVA-ST using an 414 intramuscular prime-boost schedule as above.
415 As expected, we did not measure SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 neutralizing antibodies in control mice 416 vaccinated with MVA. Single vaccination with MVA-S or MVA-ST resulted in obvious titers 417 of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 with a mean titer of 1:880 for MVA418 S and 1:2880 for MVA-ST. Boost vaccination on day 21 further increased SARS-CoV-2 419 BavPat1 neutralizing antibodies to mean titers of 1:660 or 1:3840 in MVA-S or MVA-ST 420 vaccinated mice (Figure 9A). However, neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 Delta and 421 Omicron were lower compared to SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 following MVA-S and MVA-ST 422 vaccination (Figure 9, B and C).
423 Mice immunized with MVA-S mounted sufficient levels of Delta neutralizing antibodies after 424 prime or boost application (Figure 9B, mean of 1:208 or 1:575). MVA-ST vaccination resulted 425 in a mean titer of 1:675 after prime and 1:1400 after boost (Figure 9B). For Omicron, no 426 detectable titers of neutralizing antibodies were present in mice after single vaccination with 427 either candidate vaccine. MVA-S boost vaccination again did not result in obvious titers of 428 Omicron neutralizing antibodies (Figure 9C). Marginal titers of Omicron neutralizing 429 antibodies were present in sera of mice after boost vaccination with MVA-ST (Figure 9C, mean 430 titer of 1:75).
431 At 4 weeks after boost vaccinations, mice were intranasally challenged with a lethal dose of 432 3.6x104 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1. Control mice significantly lost weight and showed 433 clinical signs of disease starting on day 3, all succumbed to infection by day 6, whereas MVA434 S and MVA-ST vaccinated mice showed no weight loss or clinical disease (Figure 9, D-F). At
18

435 4 days post infection, substantial levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper 436 respiratory tract of control vaccinated mice (mean of 6.6x103 genome equivalents /µl). In MVA437 S vaccinated mice, we detected low but detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in 438 oropharyngeal swabs (mean of 27 genome equivalents /µl). MVA-ST vaccinated mice did not 439 produce detectable viral RNA levels in oropharyngeal swabs (Figure 9G).
440 When monitoring virus loads in the lung and brain homogenates of mice at times of death (day 441 6 pi (MVA vaccinated mice) or 8 days post-challenge (MVA-S/MVA-ST vaccinated animals)), 442 we failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 in the lungs and brains of MVA-S or MVA-ST 443 vaccinated mice, but found large amounts of infectious virus in the organs from control MVA444 vaccinated mice (Figure 9H). These data were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR analysis of virus 445 RNA loads. In the control MVA vaccinated mice, we detected substantial levels of viral RNA 446 with a mean of 1.19x107 or 1.14x108 genome equivalents/ng total RNA in lungs or brains. Both 447 MVA-S and MVA-ST-immunized animals exhibited lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA than 448 in control mice in the lungs (a mean of 3.7x102 genome equivalents/ng total RNA for MVA-S 449 and 1.31 for MVA-ST; Figure 7I) and in the brains (a mean of 9.73 genome equivalents/ng total 450 RNA for MVA-S and 1.58 for MVA-ST).
451 Neutralizing antibodies against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1, SARS-CoV-2 Delta and 452 Omicron were analyzed at the end of the experiment. Marginal titers of BavPat1- and Delta453 neutralizing antibodies were present in sera of control MVA vaccinated mice after SARS-CoV454 2 BavPat1 challenge infection (mean of 1:420 for BavPat1, mean of 1:168.75 for Delta; Figure 455 9, J and K). No titers of Omicron neutralizing antibodies were found in MVA vaccinated 456 animals (Figure 9L). However, robust titers of neutralizing antibodies were present in sera of 457 MVA-S and MVA-ST vaccinated mice after SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 challenge infection (Figure 458 9, J-L): Against BavPat1, MVA-S vaccination resulted in a mean titer of 1:2240; MVA-ST 459 vaccination resulted in an even higher mean titer of 1:5600.
19

460 Against Delta, MVA-S vaccination resulted in a mean titer of 1:1333. Confirming previous 461 results, antibody levels in MVA-ST vaccinated mice were markedly higher with mean titers of 462 1:2400. However, against Omicron, a lower mean titer of 1:133 was measured for both 463 candidate vaccines (Figure 9L).
464 Consistent with data from viral load in the lungs, control MVA vaccinated animals showed 465 pronounced lung pathology, which was associated with moderate to severe perivascular edema 466 and inflammation comprising lymphocytes, macrophages and small numbers of neutrophils 467 surrounding small and intermediate vessels. Considerable inflammatory changes were also 468 found in the alveolar and peribronchiolar compartments, characterized by moderate to marked 469 interstitial and luminal immune cell infiltrates with multifocal areas of completely obscured 470 alveolar architecture. In animals vaccinated with MVA-S, despite the absence of severe and 471 widespread inflammation in the alveolar compartment, substantial perivascular and 472 peribronchiolar inflammation was also present in the lungs. Interestingly, MVA-ST vaccinated 473 mice showed only very mild signs of pulmonary lesions after SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 challenge 474 infection (Figure 10). Our data so far showed that robust protective vaccination by a prime475 boost application of 108 PFU MVA candidate vaccines is associated with substantial titers of 476 neutralizing antibodies in K18-hACE2 mice.

483 Discussion 484 Here, we report that vaccination with a pre-fusion, stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S protein (ST) 485 expressed by recombinant MVA (MVA-ST) elicits a better humoral immune response and 486 provides protection upon SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 challenge infection compared to the original 487 recombinant MVA vaccine delivering the non-modified SARS-CoV-2 S antigen (MVA-S).
488 Although several approved vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are currently available, COVID-19 489 vaccine development still remains an important goal due to unsolved questions such as 490 longevity and duration of immunity, virus transmission after asymptomatic infection, and 491 arising virus variants of concern, VOC. Thus, the development of innovative vaccination 492 modalities that also confer robust and more broadly effective protection are urgently required. 493 In general, there are several strategies to further improve vaccine candidates. A promising 494 approach includes the presentation of a selected antigen. This may be of importance when 495 processable fusion proteins are used as immunogens in vaccine development, since their 496 metastability or processing also affects the kinetics of immune responses.
497 Based on our positive experience using a non-modified S protein for generating a MVA-based 498 candidate vaccine against MERS-CoV (11), we initially decided to use the same strategy to 499 develop a COVID-19 candidate vaccine. Our MVA-S candidate vaccine expressing the 500 authentic 2019 Wuhan Hu-1 S protein was confirmed to be immunogenic and protective in 501 preclinical evaluation when tested in a mouse model for COVID-19 (15). Comparable results 502 have been reported from the Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, which also 503 expresses a non-stabilized S protein and was confirmed to be immunogenic and protective in 504 different preclinical animal models (19-21). Of note, the Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV505 19 was approved as a COVID-19 vaccine for application in humans and more than two billion 506 doses of the vaccine have already been administered (22, 23).
21

507 In this current study we report on the evaluation of the COVID-19 candidate vector vaccine 508 MVA-S in a phase Ia clinical trial in humans. Here, we again confirmed advantageous safety 509 and tolerability (data not shown). However, preliminary results revealed a pattern of antibody 510 responses in individuals vaccinated with high or low doses of MVA-S, indicating a low S1511 specific antibody response irrespective of vaccine dosage, while these individuals mounted 512 substantial titers of S2 binding antibodies. Overall, levels of S-specific antibodies were shown 513 to be below the levels of a comparable study evaluating a MVA-based candidate vaccine against 514 MERS-CoV (11).
515 A recent study indicated that the efficiency of furin mediated cleavage in the S1/S2 polybasic 516 cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 is enhanced compared to MERS-CoV (24). From these 517 preliminary in vitro results, we hypothesize that a lower furin-mediated cleavage in MERS518 CoV-S protein expressed by MVA results in S protein that is still maintained in a prefusion 519 state, still allowing S1 specific immune response activation. Since our recent data suggested 520 proper folding and authentic presentation of the trimeric spike protein expressed by MVA 521 vector virus (15), we hypothesized that processing involving furin-mediated cleavage of the S 522 protein into its membrane associated S2 subunit and the distal S1 subunit also occurs. 523 Proteolytic cleavage can be followed by shedding of S1 leaving the S2 subunit anchored within 524 the membrane (25). Our results again confirmed the authentic processing of the non-modified 525 spike protein with prominent S2 expression on the cell surface and obvious S1 shedding.
526 In previous studies, betacoronavirus S1 shedding had already been observed to inadvertently 527 influence the activation of S-specific antibodies (6, 26, 27). This has also been confirmed for 528 the activation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies after vaccination with the Oxford529 AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. The authors discuss that the shedding of cleaved S1 530 may contribute to a higher proportion of non-neutralizing relative to neutralizing antibodies 531 (28). This is in line with data from a recent study where Barros-Martins and colleagues
22

532 evaluated the impact of heterologous versus homologous ChAdOx1nCoV-19/BNT162b2 533 vaccination in humans. Here, individuals who received a homologous BNT162b2 vaccination 534 in a prime-boost schedule showed stronger antibody responses than those receiving 535 homologous ChAdOx1nCoV-19 immunizations (29). Since BNT162b2 is based on a stabilized 536 S protein, we hypothesized that S protein presentation influences immunogenicity, and that S1 537 dissociation from S2 influences the quantity and quality of MVA-S activated immune 538 responses. In another study, Dangi and colleagues confirmed that humans vaccinated with a 539 modified S protein exhibited a cross-protective immune response against heterologous 540 coronaviruses (30).
541 Several approaches have been used to stabilize various class I fusion proteins in their pre542 cleaved conformation through structure-based design. For betacoronaviruses it has been 543 suggested that presentation of the S protein in pre- or post-fusion conformation has a substantial 544 impact on the ratio of immune responses. In previous studies, two proline substitutions at the 545 apex of the central helix and heptad repeat 1 have been identified that could effectively stabilize 546 MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and human coronavirus HKU1 S proteins in the pre-cleaved 547 conformation (27, 31, 32). Such stabilized S proteins were confirmed to be more immunogenic 548 than wild-type S proteins (33, 34).
549 To evaluate the impact of structural processing of the labile S protein using our vector platform 550 technology, we generated a MVA candidate vaccine expressing pre-cleavage stabilized S 551 (MVA-ST). Modifications of full-length SARS-CoV-2-S protein expressed by MVA have 552 already been used in other studies (26, 30, 35). As expected, when tested in vivo in mice and 553 hamsters, we observed an improved antibody response after MVA-ST vaccination compared to 554 the original MVA-S candidate vaccine. In line with previous results (36), the general activation 555 of neutralizing antibodies to variant Omicron was markedly reduced compared to ancestral
23

556 BavPat1 and variant Delta. Of note, MVA-ST vaccination still induced marginally improved 557 levels of Omicron neutralizing antibodies compared to MVA-S.
558 The pattern of antibody responses in MVA-ST immunized mice clearly exhibited advantageous 559 activation of RBD-, S1- and S2-binding antibodies. RBD is located in the S1 subunit known 560 as the S protein ectodomain, and both are involved in binding to the specific cellular receptor. 561 Thus both RBD binding antibodies and those binding S1 elsewhere contribute to efficiently 562 blocking SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding. Moreover, since the fusion peptide region is located 563 within the S2 subunit, S2-binding antibodies are important for inhibiting fusion of the viral and 564 host membranes, which enables release of the viral genome into host cells.
565 Since coronaviruses can readily generate antibody-escape mutations in the RBD and S1 subunit, 566 activation of antibodies covering the entire S protein is considered desirable to ameliorate 567 vaccine induced immunity in such events. Indeed, the effectiveness of broadly reactive 568 antibodies has already been confirmed for COVID-19 where REGN-COV2, an antibody 569 cocktail mixture containing two neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain 570 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, efficiently reduced viral load in COVID-19 patients (37). 571 Thus, the activation of antibodies targeting different epitopes within the S protein could also be 572 effective against different SARS-CoV-2 VOC. This was confirmed by our findings that, 573 compared to MVA-S vaccination, superior activation of neutralizing antibodies specific for the 574 S protein of Alpha, Beta, and Gamma virus variants and against the more recent SARS-CoV-2 575 variants Delta and Omicron, was achieved in mice and hamsters vaccinated with MVA-ST. 576 The Omicron-characteristic immune evasion is based on a high number of amino acid 577 substitutions present in the RBD. Yet, there is a fraction of broadly reactive antibodies that bind 578 to sites inside and outside the RBD and potently neutralize Omicron (38).
579 Based on previous studies from other betacoronaviruses, and also from influenza viruses, we 580 hypothesize that this broadly neutralizing capacity may be explained by abundant presentation
24

581 of the prefusion S2 conformation. S2 has been confirmed to be more highly conserved than S1, 582 and represents a promising antigen to contribute to the induction of broadly protective immunity 583 against current and newly arising coronaviruses (27, 39, 40). In our study, we confirmed more 584 prominent presentation of S2 as a pre-cleavage-stabilized cell surface protein. This S2 prefusion 585 conformation, in contrast to the post-fusion S2 structure, might also contribute to more 586 effectively activating host immune responses (41, 42) also against VOC harboring high 587 numbers of mutations in S1. We also confirmed the characteristic pattern of S-specific humoral 588 immunity when we comprehensively tested our COVID-19 candidate vaccines in K18-hACE2 589 mice and the Syrian hamster model. Interestingly, despite these obvious differences in 590 activation of humoral immune responses, the activation of a S1-specific cellular immune 591 response appeared to be comparable following MVA-S and MVA-ST vaccination in mice. In 592 our case, the S1 subunit including the presumed immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 S H2Kd 593 epitope S269-278 is required to induce S1 epitope-specific CD8+ T cells (15).
594 However, since both the S proteins are initially processed via the trans-Golgi network, direct 595 MHC-I presentation should also be efficient in activating CD8+ T cell responses specific for 596 S1 epitopes. This is further confirmed by results from Western blot analysis, which detected 597 sufficient and comparable production of S1 antigen in the cell lysates of both MVA-S candidate 598 vaccines. From these data we hypothesize that S1 is properly processed by direct antigen 599 presentation resulting in sufficient activation of S1 specific CD8+ T cells. Here it will be of 600 interest to further characterize levels of S1- and S2-epitope-specific T cells in more detail, 601 especially concerning their role in protective efficacy. A robust activation of S1 epitope 602 specific T cells should also contribute to a protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2 603 variants including Omicron that has been confirmed to efficiently evade recognition by many 604 RBD-specific antibodies. Indeed, Omicron-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses are well 605 conserved suggesting negligible immune escape at the level of cellular immunity (43).
25

606 Thus, we hypothesize that robust MVA-ST mediated protection against variant SARS-CoV-2 607 including Omicron will rely on the activation of broadly reactive antibodies targeting conserved 608 antigenic sites within the S-protein and the induction of cellular immunity.
609 Intriguingly, when we evaluated protective efficacy against intranasal SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 610 infection, the clinical outcome of both MVA-S and MVA-ST vaccinated animals appeared 611 similar, since neither group showed any weight loss or morbidity. Since the primary goal of 612 current SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and approved vaccines is to prevent symptomatic 613 COVID-19 (2), our results from the infection models indicate that both MVA-COVID 614 candidate vaccines are suitable for achieving this. Reduced morbidity is matched by reduced 615 viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tract of vaccinated animals, although MVA-ST 616 appeared to increase the rate of reduction. One can surmise that significantly reducing SARS617 CoV-2 virus load in the lungs results in moderating the severity of the disease. Of note, 618 compared to the MVA-S vaccinated hamsters, those vaccinated with MVA-ST also showed 619 significantly reduced viral shedding on day 6. This might also be the result of the broader 620 reactive antibody response combined with a robust activation of neutralizing antibodies leading 621 to rapid virus control in the upper and lower respiratory tract.
622 Of particular interest, when we characterized the vaccination effect in the hamsters in more 623 detail, postmortem at 6 dpi, we found that MVA-ST vaccinated animals seemed more robustly 624 protected from lung pathology, particularly in the alveolar compartment. Diffuse alveolar 625 damage resulting from SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 infection represents a clinically relevant 626 pathomorphological lesion associated with impaired gas exchange, potentially resulting in acute 627 respiratory distress syndrome. Here, in most of the MVA-ST vaccinated animals alveolar 628 lesions were completely absent or minimal. In the MVA-S vaccinated group, the extent of 629 alveolar inflammation and damage was also reduced compared to controls, correlating with the 630 lack of clinical symptoms. However, mild to moderate lesions involving up to 25-50% of the
26

631 lung lobe were still present in all these animals, suggesting incomplete protection of these 632 tissues.
633 The absence of substantial alveolar pathology and inflammation without any SARS-2-N antigen 634 expression in the lungs of MVA-ST vaccinated hamsters favors the idea that the risk of 635 developing Long COVID is also reduced. However, this needs to be confirmed in future studies. 636 Since the K18-hACE2 mouse model recapitulates the outcome of severe COVID-19 in humans, 637 efficacy testing of SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines in the K18hACE2 SARS-CoV-2 infection 638 model is of substantial value (32, 42). We confirmed the severe and lethal disease outcome in 639 this model for mice that had been vaccinated with non-recombinant MVA. Despite the absence 640 of death, disease, and even viral load in the lungs of MVA-S vaccinated mice, substantial 641 pulmonary pathology including vasculitis and bronchitis were observed. Of note, vasculitis has 642 been also described as one of the complications of COVID-19 in humans (43).
643 In contrast, such pathological outcomes were not detected at all in mice vaccinated with MVA644 ST. However, since the severity of disease in this model is also mediated by neurological 645 involvement, both the candidate vaccines appeared to readily protect against the lethal outcome 646 of disease presumably through rapidly inhibiting initial replication in the respiratory tract (44). 647 Despite this robust protection achieved in these mice, the observed differences in the outcome 648 of pathology in this model further support the advantage of the modified S protein.
649 Vice versa, our data also indicate that authentic S processing during viral infection plays an 650 important role in terms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis as an immune evasion strategy. This 651 hypothesis is supported by our results that MVA-S immunogenicity is markedly lower than that 652 of the MVA-ST candidate vaccine. Importantly, we confirmed that a pre-cleavage, stabilized S 653 protein activates a beneficial antibody response. These data suggest that a deeper understanding 654 of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and its potential immune evasion strategies is not only
27

655 important for better understanding the viral pathogenesis, but also for developing new 656 vaccination strategies. 657 Taken together, the availability of a vaccine that not only prevents the obvious development of 658 clinical disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also avoids excessive alveolar damage, 659 inflammation, and subsequent remodeling is highly desirable. 660 Here, we confirmed the improved efficacy of MVA-ST in preclinical models. These findings 661 merit clinical studies using the MVA-ST candidate vaccine to further characterize the immune 662 responses in humans, not only in homologous immunization cohorts but also in heterologous 663 schedules using mRNA or adenovirus vectors as primary vaccinations. It will also be of 664 particular interest to evaluate how long protective immune responses are maintained and 665 whether broader protection can be achieved. These studies are important due to the still ongoing 666 pandemic and the fact that we still lack data on the impact of vaccine-induced immune-response 667 durability on protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676

678 Study design and participants.
679 A phase 1 clinical trial was conducted to address safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine 680 candidate MVA-S in healthy adults (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04569383). The study 681 was conducted in Hamburg (Germany) at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf 682 (UKE). Study participants were divided into two dose groups that received either 1×107 IU (low 683 dose) or 1×108 IU (high dose) on days 0 and 28 (11).
684 Bead-based serological multiplex assay.
685 Serum samples were obtained by venipuncture from vaccinated individuals. Bead-based 686 serological multiplex assay was performed using the MultiCoV-Ab assay validated previously 687 (16, 17). MagPlex Microspheres with immobilized different parts of the spike protein based on 688 SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain (GenBank accession no. MN908947.3) were used: 689 purified trimeric spike protein (S), S1-domain, RBD (all produced in-house) and S2-domain 690 (Sino Biological). Serum samples were incubated at a dilution of 1:400 for two hours at RT. 691 Subsequently, the beads were washed using 100 µl of washing buffer (PBS supplemented with 692 0.05% (v/v) Tween20) per well with aid of a LifeSep magnetic separator unit (Dexter magnetic 693 technologies). After three washing steps, bound antibodies were detected using PE-coupled 694 secondary anti-human IgG antibodies (Dianova, Cat-No. 109-116-098, Lot-No. 148837, 695 3µg/mL), incubated for 45 min at RT. Samples were measured using the Bio-Plex 200 System 696 (Bio-Rad Laboratories), controlled by BioPlex manager software, version 5.0.0.531. Cut-off 697 (CO) samples with a known MFI value were generated as previously established (44) and 698 included on each plate as quality control.

700 To quantify the cellular localization of S1 and S2, Huh-7 cells were infected with MVA-SARS701 S or -ST (MOI 0.5) or transfected with plasmids encoding unstabilized S. 18 h post 702 transfection/infection, S located at the cell surface was labeled at 4°C prior to fixation using an 703 anti-S1 monoclonal antibody derived from human (generated and kindly provided by F. Klein, 704 Institute of Virology, University Hospital of Cologne, Germany (18)). Subsequently, cells were 705 fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100 and total S was labeled using anti706 S2 antibody from mouse (GeneTex, Cat-No. GTX632604, clone 1A9, 1:100). Polyclonal goat 707 anti-mouse AlexaFluor 594 (Cat-No. A-11005) and goat anti-human AlexaFluor 488 (Cat-No. 708 A-48276) secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:200) were used to visualize spike709 specific staining by fluorescence. Nuclei were stained with 1 µg/ml of DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, 710 Cat-No. D9542) and cells were analyzed using the Leica SP2 confocal microscope (Leica) with 711 ×63 objective. All quantification of IF-related data was performed with ImageJ/Fiji v.1.51 (45). 712 To quantify surface S, optical sections of Huh-7 cells (500 nm/slice) were acquired in order to 713 project the entire cell. Pixel intensities were measured in S1 (surface) and in S2 (total S) 714 channels. The ratio between S1 and S2 values was calculated giving the relative surface 715 expression. Prior to each analysis cell borders were determined using standard selection tools.
716 SARS-2 S1 surface staining for flow cytometry.
717 A549 cells were infected with 1 MOI MVA-S /-ST, and MVA and incubated for 16 h at 37°C, 718 cells were harvested and plated onto 96-well U-bottom plates at 2x105 cells/well. Cells were 719 incubated with purified anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (Fc block; BioLegend, clone 93, 1:500) for 15 720 min on ice. Cells were incubated with anti-S1 human monoclonal antibody (see above,) for 30 721 min on ice and then with goat anti-human IgG (H+L) Alexa Fluor® 488 (Thermo Fisher 722 Scientific, Cat-No. A-48276, 1:3000) for 30 min on ice. Cells were then stained with fixable 723 dead cell viability dye Zombie Aqua (Biolegend, Cat-No. 423101, 1:1000). After staining, cells 724 were fixed using Fixation Buffer (Biolegend) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Data

725 was acquired by the MACSQuant VYB Flow Analyser (Miltenyi Biotec) and analyzed using 726 FlowJo (FlowJo LLC, BD Life Sciences).
727 Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50).
728 Serum samples were used to analyze neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 (Isolate 729 Germany/BavPat1/2020; Isolate hCoV-19/USA/PHC658/2021, Lineage B.1.617.2 Delta 730 variant; Isolate hCoV-19/USA/MD-HP20874/2021, Lineage B.1.1.529, Omicron Variant) 731 received from BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH as previously described with some modifications 732 (46). Heat-inactivated serum samples were serially diluted 2-fold in duplicates in 50 µl DMEM. 733 Then 50 l of virus suspension (600 TCID50) was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 734 1 h before placing the mixtures on VeroE6 cells, seeded in 96-well pates. After incubation for 735 45 min, 100 µl of 1:1 mixture of pre-warmed DMEM and Avicel RC-591 (Dupont, Nutrition 736 & Biosciences) was added and plates were incubated for 24 h. After incubation, cells were fixed 737 with 4% formaldehyde/PBS and stained with a polyclonal rabbit antibody against SARS-CoV738 2 nucleoprotein (Sino Biological, Cat-No. 40588-T62, 1:2000) and a secondary peroxidase739 labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Agilent Dako, Cat-No. P044801-2, 1:1000). The signal was 740 developed using a precipitate forming TMB substrate (True Blue, KPL SeraCare, Cat-No. 741 5510-0030) and the number of infected cells per well was counted by using ImmunoSpot® 742 reader (CTL Europe GmbH). The reciprocal of the highest serum dilution allowing reduction 743 of >50% plaque formation was calculated as the serum neutralization titer (PRNT50) using 744 BioSpotTM Software Suite.
745 SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization test (VNT100).
746 The neutralizing activity of mouse serum antibodies was investigated based on a previously 747 published protocol (47). Briefly, samples were serially diluted in 96-well plates starting from a 748 1:16 serum dilution. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37°C together with 100 PFU of SARS-
31

749 CoV-2. Cytopathic effects on VeroE6 cells were analyzed 4 days (BavPat1, Alpha, Gamma) or 750 6 days (Zeta) after infection. Neutralization was defined as absence of the cytopathic effects 751 compared to virus controls. For each test, a positive control (human monoclonal antibody (18, 752 48)) was used in quadruplicate as an inter-assay neutralization standard.
753 Challenge-infection experiments in Syrian hamsters and K18-hACE2 mice.
754 For SARS-CoV-2 challenge-infection, animals were kept in individually ventilated cages 755 (IVCs, Tecniplast) in approved BSL-3 facilities. All animal and laboratory work with infectious 756 SARS-CoV-2 was performed in a biosafety level-3e laboratory and facilities at the Research 757 Center for Emerging Infections and Zoonoses (RIZ), University of Veterinary Medicine, 758 Hanover, Germany. 759 All animals were infected via intranasal route with 1x104 (hamsters) or 3.6x104 (mice) tissue 760 culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2 (Isolate Germany/BavPat1/2020, NR761 52370) received from BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH under anesthesia. After challenge infection 762 hamsters and mice were monitored at least twice daily for well-being, health constitution and 763 clinical signs using a clinical score sheet (Supplemental Table S2). Body weights were checked 764 daily.
765 Virus.
766 SARS-CoV-2 (Isolate Germany/BavPat1/2020, NR-52370; Isolate hCoV767 19/USA/PHC658/2021, Lineage B.1.617.2 Delta variant, NR-55611; Isolate hCoV768 19/USA/MD-HP20874/2021, Lineage B.1.1.529, Omicron variant, NR-56461) received from 769 BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH were propagated in VeroE6 cells (ATCC #CRL-1586) in DMEM 770 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 771 1% L-glutamine at 37°C. All infection experiments with SARS-CoV-2 were performed in
32

772 biosafety level 3 laboratories at the RIZ, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, 773 Germany or the Institute of Virology, Philipps University Marburg, Germany.
774 Measurement of viral burden.
775 Lung tissue samples of immunized and challenged hamsters or mice excised from the right lung 776 lobes, and brain tissue excised from the right brain of mice were homogenized in 1000 µl 777 DMEM containing antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin, Gibco). Tissue was homogenized 778 using the TissueLyser-II (Qiagen), and aliquots were stored at -80°C. Virus titers were 779 determined on Vero cells as median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50 units). Briefly, Vero 780 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and serial 10-fold dilutions of homogenized lung samples 781 in DMEM containing 5% FBS. After incubation for 96 hours at 37°C, cytopathic effects in 782 Vero cells were evaluated and calculated as TCID50 unit per gram or ml using the Reed-Muench 783 method. For samples without cytopathic effect, data points were set to half of detection limit 784 for statistical analysis purposes.
785 Statistical analysis.
786 Data were prepared using GraphPad Prism 9.0.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego CA, 787 USA) and R 4.2.1 and expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) or median ± 788 interquartile range. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test to 789 compare three or more groups. A P value < 0.05 was used as the threshold for statistical 790 significance.
