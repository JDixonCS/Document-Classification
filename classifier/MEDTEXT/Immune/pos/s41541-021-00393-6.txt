Scientific rationale for developing potent RBD-based vaccines

targeting COVID-19

Harry Kleanthous1, Judith Maxwell Silverman 2, Karen W. Makar1, In-Kyu Yoon 3, Nicholas Jackson3  and David W. Vaughn 1

Vaccination of the global population against COVID-19 is a great scientific, logistical, and moral challenge. Despite the rapid development and authorization of several full-length Spike (S) protein vaccines, the global demand outweighs the current supply and there is a need for safe, potent, high-volume, affordable vaccines that can fill this gap, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Whether SARS-CoV-2 S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)-based vaccines could fill this gap has been debated, especially with regards to its suitability to protect against emerging viral variants of concern. Given a predominance for elicitation of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that target RBD following natural infection or vaccination, a key biomarker of protection, there is merit for selection of RBD as a sole vaccine immunogen. With its high-yielding production and manufacturing potential, RBD-based vaccines offer an abundance of temperature-stable doses at an affordable cost. In addition, as the RBD preferentially focuses the immune response to potent and recently recognized cross-protective determinants, this domain may be central to the development of future pan-sarbecovirus vaccines. In this study, we review the data supporting the non-inferiority of RBD as a vaccine immunogen compared to full-length S-protein vaccines with respect to humoral and cellular immune responses against both the prototype pandemic SARS-CoV-2 isolate and emerging variants of concern.

INTRODUCTION
Unprecedented progress has been made in the design, development, production, and distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines to address the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVAX, a global initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines led by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, has delivered over 370 million doses to 144 countries and territories (https://www.unicef.org/supply/covid-19-vaccine-market-dashboard). Despite these remarkable achievements, there are serious challenges threatening the initial target delivery of 2 billion doses in 2021, such as raw material shortages, manufacturing delays, safety signals, the emergence of multiple viral variants of concern and interest (VOC/ VOI)1,2, and unequal procurement of vaccines by high-income countries. Ultimately, these challenges may result in a significant shortfall and delay in vaccine being made available to low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).
Most of the COVID-19 vaccines currently available or soon to be available to COVAX--including adenovirus-vectored, mRNA, and protein-subunit vaccines--use antigens based upon the SARSCoV-2 full-length Spike (S) protein. Figure 1 illustrates the S-protein in its trimeric prefusion conformation showing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on each protomer at the apex, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the conserved S2 stalk region3,4. Vaccine approaches using just the RBD region as an antigen have the advantage of focusing immunity to key protective determinants. As an immunogen, the RBD shares multiple positive attributes with the parental full-length S-protein (Table 1), as well as potential production and manufacturing advantages such as delivery of abundant5, temperature-stable6,7 vaccine doses at an affordable cost, critical factors for distributing vaccine to LMIC. Following several successful preclinical proof-of-

concept studies, RBD candidates have been advanced into clinical testing utilizing multiple vaccine platforms (Table 2). With the potential for making billions of doses of RBD vaccines available, its manufacture at single-site production facilities by experienced developing country vaccine manufacturers (DCVM) will obviate the need for numerous tech-transfers and minimize the risk of delays. This will be especially important in case there is a need to update the vaccine based on epidemiological trends, as is the case for seasonal influenza vaccines.
Available data are evaluated here from numerous preclinical and clinical studies, supporting the non-inferiority of RBD vaccine immunogens compared to full-length S-protein (Table 1), both with respect to eliciting homotypic and heterotypic crossneutralizing antibody (nAb) responses and cross-protection against emerging variants.
CLINICAL DATA SUPPORT NAB AS A BIOMARKER OF PROTECTION
Vaccine-induced immunity and efficacy are being used to help establish a correlate of protection (CoP), a measurable immune response (often nAb titer) predictive of protection, as has been demonstrated for some licensed vaccines8,9. As of October 2021, both meta-analyses and prospective case-cohort sampling analyses have found a strong correlation between nAb titers and protection against COVID-1910-13. This is underpinned by passive immunization and preclinical vaccine efficacy studies in nonhuman primates (NHPs) that similarly support nAb as a CoP14-16.
Meta-analyses of numerous clinical candidates support the correlation between vaccine efficacy and nAb titer, regardless of vaccine platform. In seeking to establish a CoP for COVID-19 vaccines, both Earle et al.11 and Khoury et al.12 initially showed only a weak relationship between efficacy and reported nAb or

further strengthened (rank correlation  = 0.86) when the analysis uncoupled the timing of the second dose and efficacy in the AstraZeneca ChAdOx trial13. A recent pre-publication investigating

direct quantitative comparison of immune correlates results from

the AZD12222 trial and the mRNA-1273 Coronavirus Efficacy (COVE) trial shows remarkably consistent results for nAb10. This

direct comparison was enabled by calibrating assays and

reporting results against the WHO International Standard17, steps

that are essential for comparing clinical immunological data and

by now should be the standard in the field19. The same pre-

publication also noted that 68.5% of vaccine efficacy was

mediated by the day 29 cID50 titer in the mRNA-1272 COVE

trial10. The totality of the data support neutralization titer as a

potential surrogate endpoint in future clinical trials of mRNA-1273.

These statistical efforts to identify a CoP for COVID-19 vaccines are

being increasingly recognized by vaccine manufacturers and

regulatory agencies. The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products

Regulatory Agency approved a pivotal Phase 3 study design to

support vaccine authorization comparing the immunogenicity of a

candidate vaccine to the immunogenicity of an approved vaccine

with clinical evidence of efficacy, using nAb as a biomarker of protection20. Additional clinical trial-specific analyses expressed in

International Units are awaited, as well as assessment of the

durability of this correlation over time and impact of

circulating VOC.

tion from the US Food and Drug Admisnistration on 26 May 202138. Potent mAbs to other RBD-specific sites have also been in clinical development (REGN10889 and LY-COVV555), although at least one has been shown to significantly lose potency against the VOC following evolutionary changes in the RBD.
To date, several RBD bAbs with potent neutralizing activity have
been demonstrated to be unaffected by the RBD mutations seen
in the newly circulating Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351) viral variants29,39-41 (for a list of the mutations in RBD, see Table 3).

(https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/). Many mutations in RBD appear to have enhanced receptor-
binding affinity, resulting in increased infectivity and transmission. Viral variants that emerge harboring mutations in S-protein have the potential to evade nAb responses from previous infection, mAb therapies, or immunity from prior vaccination. The restricted antigenic changes observed in the SARS-COV-2 RBD support a convergent evolution theory, potentially a result of host adaptation leading to enhanced infectivity, and highlights the need for more broadly cross-neutralizing immunity49. As a result bivalent vaccine approaches targeting two or more variants are currently being explored for S-protein and RBD-based vaccines, in hopes of achieving broader coverage and protection against VOC48,50. although the utility of a bivalent vaccine formulation must be considered in the context of evolving epidemiology and additional booster shots with the prototype vaccine.

NTD: A FUNCTIONAL NEUTRALIZATION TARGET
Full S-protein vaccine antigens all contain the NTD, a second neutralization target. Several NTD-specific mAbs isolated from convalescent memory B cells, as well mAbs isolated from plasmablasts following mRNA vaccination, have demonstrated potent neutralizing capabilities against the original Wuhan-1 pandemic virus37,42. Many of these NTD-targeting mAbs are nonneutralizing and have been shown to inhibit cell-to-cell fusion, activate alternate effector functions, and have been demonstrated to be protective from SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

B-cell responses were rich in recurrent and clonally expanded antibody sequences, with 10-90% of S-protein-specific memory B cells recognizing the RBD domain51,52. These clonal memory B
cells were determined to express antibodies with evidence of
somatic hypermutation, with some having increased neutraliza-
tion potency and resistance to RBD mutations. Individuals with
even modest plasma-neutralizing activity have also been shown to
harbor rare IgG memory B cells that produce potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization Ab53. For certain antibody lineages, maturation
enabled neutralization of circulating SARS-CoV-2 VOC and heterologous sarbecoviruses54.

The NTD is a site of prevalent and recurrent deletion regions, which vary by length and location43. In addition, the currently
designated VOCs harbor multiple mutations in the NTD, suggest-
ing ongoing selective pressure, with NTD highly divergent across the different variants and other sarbecoviruses1. As such, an

Recent work has shown that vaccination is similarly able to induce robust memory. The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer BNT162b2 or Moderna mRNA-1273) efficiently primed memory B cells specific

Due to the anticipated benefit of vaccine-induced T-cell immunity to SARS-COV-2, CD4 and CD8 T-cell epitope mapping using overlapping peptides has been performed across the full length of the S-protein. An evaluation of CD4 T-cell responses in humans reported a frequency of at least 20% focused on discrete regions of the S-protein, including the NTD, the C-terminal domain, the neighboring fusion protein region, and the RBD68,69.

have focused on parenteral immunization to elicit high-titer serum

T-cell reactivity to S-protein in vaccinees were robust against the
SARS-COV-2 variant mutations. The RBD contains fewer immunodominant CD4 T-cell epitopes
than the full-length S-protein. Despite this fact, there is ample evidence that sufficient numbers of T-cell epitopes are presented by the RBD to generate good CD4 responses and elevated levels of functionally nAb16,71. The identification of multiple common CD4 T-cell epitopes within the RBD has been independently verified using different T-cell epitope mapping approaches69,72,73. Clinical studies with RBD antigens support the assertion that sufficient T-cell help is provided following immunization (Table 2). Immunization with an mRNA-encoded
RBD vaccine candidate showed the induction of nAb titers ranging from 0.7-fold (1 g dose) to 4.6-fold (30 g dose) higher than HCS74,75. Notably, induction of robust nAb titers by RBD was not specific to the mRNA platform. A protein-subunit RBD-

PROTOTYPE RBD-NP VACCINE
The Institute for Protein Design (University of Washington) SARSCoV-2 vaccine consists of a self-assembling, two-component nanoparticle that displays 60 copies of RBD per nanoparticle26. The RBD-np (nanoparticle) is produced in mammalian cells and maintains the two functional N-linked glycosylation sites (N331 and N343), important for proper folding of protein and for antibody recognition26. A comparison of the glycosylation patterns between the RBD-np and the S-2P trimer was very similar at the two sites, both exhibiting complex glycan that were heavily fucosylated. The RBD-np candidate administered intramuscularly proved safe, was as immunogenic as a recently described next-generation prefusion S-protein trimer107, and protected mice and rhesus macaques from live virus challenge. SK bioscience is developing the RBD-np vaccine technology from the University of Washington and is currently in Phase III clinical

rearranged human antibody variable and constant region germline repertoire confirmed the ability of this candidate to mount

sequence68. Similar to CD4 epitopes, by definition, the RBD subdomain of S-protein contains fewer CD8 T-cell epitopes than the full-length S-protein. Therefore, it is not clear whether RBD would contain adequate CD8 T-cell epitopes for a vaccine whose protection was based on eliciting CD8 T cells. In this context, the broader number of epitopes in the full S-protein may be advantageous.
Due to large variations in T-cell assay methodology and resultant data, cross-study comparisons of T-cell responses are difficult, if not impossible, to interpret79,80. Full appreciation of the effect of vaccine platform and antigen on CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses will require standardized peripheral blood mononuclear cell collection and assay protocols, as was established within the COVID-19 Prevention Network and the COVE trial. Interpretable comparison of vaccine-induced cell-mediated immunity is expected within the year.

NHP studies compared adjuvants (head-to-head) for advance-
ment of the leading formulations for clinical development. Groups
of rhesus macaques were immunized twice with RBD-np, plus one of five adjuvants including AS03, Alum-CpG, Alum, AS37, and another oil-in-water emulsion16. Both pseudovirus and live virus
neutralization assays against the B.1 virus supported elevated
titers with the AS03, Alum-CpG, and Alum adjuvants. Following intranasal/intratracheal challenge, significant protection was observed against viral burden in both the upper respiratory tract
(URT) and in the lungs using an established sub-genomic mRNA assay with E-gene-specific primers, as well as protection against disease using positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Vaccination through intramuscular administration achieved a significant reduction in viral burden in the URT, potentially supporting the ability of RBD-based vaccines to also

With waning immunity and regulatory discussions on potential booster doses, we speculate that the availability of an RBD-based vaccine strategy that targets immunity to key cross-protective determinants may be a considerable advantage, a vaccination strategy potentially for both the previously immunized and those naturally infected.
