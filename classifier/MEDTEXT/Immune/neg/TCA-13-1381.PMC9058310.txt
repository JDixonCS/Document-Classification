Abstract Background: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are regarded as vital regulatory factors in various cancers. However, the biological functions of circDNER in the paclitaxel (PTX) resistance of lung cancer remain largely unexplored. Methods: Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze circDNER, miR-139-5p, and ITGB8. Cell proliferation was assessed via colony formation and MTT assays. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry. Western blot was performed to assess protein expression. The targeted interaction among circDNER, miR-139-5p, and ITGB8 were validated using dualluciferase reporter or RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Results: Inhibition of circDNER reduced IC50 of PTX, inhibited cell proliferation, invasion and migration, as well as promoted cell apoptosis in PTX-resistant lung cancer cells. Mechanistically, circDNER sponged miR-139-5p to upregulate ITGB8 expression. Overexpression of miR-139-5p reversed the biological functions mediated by circDNER in PTX-resistant lung cancer cells. MiR-139-5p overexpression suppressed PTX resistance and malignant behaviors of PTX-resistant lung cancer cells, with ITGB8 elevation rescued the impacts. Moreover, we demonstrated that circDNER was upregulated in plasma exosomes from lung cancer patients. The plasma exosomes derived from these patients are the key factors enhancing the migration and invasion potential of lung cancer cells. Conclusion: The circDNER mediated miR-139-5p/ITGB8 axis suppresses lung cancer progression. Our findings suggest that circDNER might act as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for lung cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer, a major malignancy, is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.1 Although many therapies, such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, have been applied to treat lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate remains low due to tumor invasion and metastasis as well as lack of effective biomarkers and targets.2 Hence, exploring novel approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer are urgently required.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs that possess a covalent closed loop. To date, it has

been proven that circRNAs play a vital role and participate
in proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in various malignancies, including bladder, pancreatic, and esophageal cancers.3 Previous studies have shown that circRNAs can
regulate tumor pathological progression and may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers of cancer;4-6 however,
whether circDNER influences lung cancer remains unclear.
Exosomes are membrane vesicles produced by various cells and character with diameters ranging from 30-
100 nm. The main functions of exosomes are transferring intercellular signal transduction to recipient cells.7,8 It has

been demonstrated that exosomes are involved in modulating drug response, as well as tumorigenesis, tumor invasion and metastasis by delivering micro (mi)RNA, long noncoding (lnc)RNA, circular (circ) RNA and proteins.9 CircRNA are exceptionally stable in all cargos carried by exosomes.10 However, the mechanism of circRNAs in the exosomes of lung cancer patients remains to be definitively elucidated.
In this study, circDNER was first identified by circRNA microarray analysis in exosomes from the plasma of lung cancer patients. Our data showed that circDNER was obviously upregulated in lung cancer tissues and plasma exosomes of lung cancer patients. Moreover, we found that circDNER competitively binds to miR-139-5p to regulate proliferation, invasion, metastasis and apoptosis via mediating ITGB8 expression in lung cancer. Our findings suggest that circDNER might act as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for the treatment of lung cancer.
METHODS
CircRNA microarray analysis
A microarray assay was used to analyze the circRNA expression of lung adenocarcinoma and adjacent noncancerous tissues as well as plasma exosome samples collected from the Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University.
Clinical specimens
All human lung cancer tissue samples and plasma samples were obtained from the Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University. The tumors were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. The plasma samples were stored at À80C. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and this study was approved by the ethics committee of Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University.
Exosome isolation
All the samples were prepared by centrifuging for 5 min at 500 g. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min to remove shed macrovesicles. The supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.22 m membrane filter. Finally, the supernatant was centrifuged at 110 000 g for 70 min.

incubation with RIP immunoprecipitation buffer. Proteinase K buffer was then added to the samples. After purifying, all RNAs were analyzed by qRT-PCR.

Dual-luciferase reporter assay
The putative binding sequence of miR-139-5p and circDNER or ITGB8 was predicted by Circinteractome or TargetScan. Wild-type (WT) sequencing of circDNER or ITGB8 30UTR with binding sequence for miR-139-5p was cloned into the pmirGLO vector (YouBia) to construct WTcircDNER or WT- ITGB8 30UTR. At the same time, mutant reporter plasmids (MUT-circDNER or MUT-ITGB8 30UTR) without binding sequence for miR-139-5p were generated in the same way. The indicated vector and miR-NC/miR139-5p were then cotransfected into A549/PTX cells. After 48 h of cotransfection, a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) was used to examine luciferase activity.

Western blot (WB)
The samples were lysed in RIPA buffer (Beyotime), separated using 10% SDS-PAGE, and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h and then incubated with diluted primary antibodies to CD 63 (1:1000, ab118307), HSP70 (1:1000, ab2787), TSG101 (1:1000, ab125011), ITGB8 (1:2000, ab80673) and GAPDH (1:2000, ab371685) overnight at 4C. After washing with TBST for three times, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibodies for 35 min at room temperature. The relative levels of proteins were analyzed by calculating the ratio of the gray value.

RESULTS
CircDNER is significantly upregulated in lung cancer tissues and cells, and increased circDNER expression predicts poor prognosis
To explore the effect of circDNER in the pathogenesis of lung cancer, GSE101684 microarray analysis was performed to evaluate numerous dysregulated circRNAs in tumor tissues. The analysis showed that circDNER was significantly upregulated in lung cancer tissue (Figure 1a, b), which indicated circDNER might play a crucial role in the development of lung cancer. At the same time, using qRT-PCR, we found that circDNER was obviously increased in lung cancer tissue and A549 cells (Figure 1c,

from PTX-resistant cell culture media. First, exosomes of A549/PTX cells were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 2a). Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) further confirmed that the dominant size of vesicles was 100 nm, and concentrations at 100 nm multiplied by dilution factors produced concentrations of 4.5 Â 108/ml for A549 and 9.6 Â 108/ml for A549/PTX, respectively (Figure 2b). We examined the exosomal markers CD63, HSP70 and Tsg101 by western blotting. The data showed that higher levels of CD63, HSP70 and Tsg101 were discovered confirming the purity of the exosomes (Figure 2c). Moreover, circDNER expression in A549 cells was strikingly lower than in A549/PTX cells (Figure 2d). In addition,

markedly higher expression of circDNER and IC50 values were observed after treatment with exosomes (Figure 2e,f). To investigate the function of circDNER in vivo, a mice xenograft model was established. The data showed that A549 + PTX Exo + PTX group mice promoted tumor growth (Figures 2g-j).

cells (A549/PTX) (Figure 3a). Meanwhile, we analyzed the circDNER expression in PTX-senstive or PTX-resistant tumor tissue, and found that circDNER expression was increased in PTX-resistant tumor tissue and cells (Figures 3b,c). To further confirm the effect of circDNER in PTX resistance, we next examined whether knockdown of circDNER would resensitize these cells to PTX treatment. We silenced circDNER expression by transfection of sh-circDNER. We found that IC50 value of PTX was decreased after knockdown of circDNER (Figure 3d,e).
To demonstrate the effect of circDNER on lung cancer cells, we examined cell proliferation using clone formation assays. Our findings suggested that silencing circDNER could obviously inhibit the proliferation of A549/PTX cells (Figure 3f). Flow cytometry data showed that silencing circDNER promoted cell apoptosis (Figure 3g). A transwell assay was utilized to detect cell invasion and motility. The results were consistent with proliferation, which indicated that downregulation of circDNER markedly restrained cell invasion and motility (Figure 3h,i). Together, these data implicated that circDNER downregulation could resensitize A549/PTX.
CircDNER serves as a miRNA sponge for miR139-5p
It has previously been determined that circRNAs can serve as miRNA sponges to regulate miRNA targets.12 We next explored the ability of circDNER to bind miRNAs. Our results indicated that the potential interactions between miR-139-5p and circDNER by online databases starBase,

circNet, and RNA22 (Figure 4a). We observed that miR139-5p upregulation obviously decreased the luciferase activity in the WT-circDNER group but not in the MUTcircDNER group (Figure 4b). Moreover, lower expression of miR-139-5p was observed in resistant tissues and A549/PTX cells (Figure 4c,d). To assess the binding capacity of circDNER and miR-139-5p, RIP assays were performed which demonstrated that circDNER can bind with miR-139-5p (Figure 4e). As shown in Figure 4e, miR-139-5p expression was negatively correlated with circ DNER expression in lung cancer tissue (Figure 4f). Furthermore, miR-139-5p expression was increased when circDNER was silenced in PTXresistant cells. These data concluded that circDNER directly targeted miR-139-5p.
Silencing CircDNER enhanced PTX sensitivity in A549/PTX cells by upregulating miR-139-5p
To investigate whether miR-139-5p mediated the function of sh-circDNER, rescue experiments were performed in A549/PTX. Higher expression of miR-139-5p was observed by downregulating circDNER, which was attenuated by inhibiting miR-139-5p (Figure S1). Additionally, we found that miR-139-5p inhibition reduced the suppressive effects of knockdown circDNER colony-forming ability (Figure 5a). Moreover, miR-139-5p silencing reversed sh-circDNERtriggered cell apoptosis (Figure 5b). Meanwhile, the inhibitory effects of circDNER knockdown on migration and invasion were also counteracted by interference of miR-139-5p (Figure 5c,d). In summary, circDNER mediated PTX sensitivity by targeting miR-139-5p.

CircDNER regulates expression of ITGB8 via miR-139-5p
It is well known that miRNAs mediate biological functions by directly targeting mRNAs.13,14 We identified five genes that were screened in lung cancer cells transfected with mimic-miR-139-5p and inhibitor-miR-139-5p. The results showed that ITGB8 exhibited the most obvious change after treatment with mimic-miR-139-5p and inhibitor-miR139-5p Figure S2). Complementary sites between miR139-5p and ITGB8 were observed in Figure 6a, suggesting that miR-139-5p might directly target ITGB8. Moreover, we observed that miR-139-5p upregulation obviously decreased luciferase activity in the WT-ITGB8 group but not in the MUT-TGB8 group (Figure 6b). Meanwhile, the expression of ITGB8 including mRNA and protein was higher in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues (Figure 6c,d). RIP

assays demonstrated that miR-139-5p could target ITGB8 (Figure 6e). In addition, the expression of ITGB8 was negatively modulated by miR-139-5p. There was a higher expression of ITGB8 in lung cancer than in corresponding paracancerous tissues (Figure 6f). Additionally, we found that overexpression of miR-139-5p inhibited the ITGB8 protein level in A549/PTX cells. In this study, we found that miR-139-5p directly targeted ITGB8 and negatively mediated its expression in A549/PTX cells.

downregulating miR-139-5p in A549/PTX cells clearly inhibited ITGB8 expression, while ITGB8 overexpression counteracted the inhibition effect of miR-139-5p on ITGB8 expression (Figure 7a). In addition, we observed that overexpression of miR-139-5p suppressed the colony-forming ability and promoted the cell apoptosis, while addition of ITGB8 could reverse the effect (Figure 7b,c). Moreover, enforced expression miR-139-5p repressed migration and invasion of A549/PTX and the effect could be abated after overexpression of ITGB8 (Figure 7d,e).
CircDNER meditates ITGB8 expression by binding with miR-139-5p
Finally, we investigated whether circDNER could regulate ITGB8 expression by sponging miR-139-5p. Our data indicated that knockdown of circDNER decreased TPD52 protein expression, while silencing miR-139-5p could reverse the impact (Figure 8a), which indicated that circDNER could regulate ITGB88 expression by sponging miR-139-5p. A schematic diagram of the mechanism was created and is shown in Figure 8b.

DISCUSSION
Lung cancer is a common cancer characterized by high recurrence and poor 5-year survival rates.15 A number of therapies which have been applied for the treatment of lung cancer have failed due to lack of specific molecular targets and effective interventions.16 Therefore, searching for novel genetic targets and the pursuit of prognostic markers are critical for lung cancer.
In recent years, RNAs (circRNAs) have attracted great attention and have been shown to have a close relationship with various human malignant tumors.17,18 Previous studies have found that circ_0002346 and circ_0001658 are downregulated in lung cancer, which are positively correlated with tumor size, lymphatic invasion, or lymph node metastasis in patients. In our study, we found upregulated expression of circDNER in lung cancer tissues and cells, suggesting circDNER could promote lung cancer proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo, hence downregulating the circDNER had the opposite effect. It is well accepted that circRNAs can negatively regulate miRNA activity.11 Our data indicated that circ DNER increased lung cancer invasion and metastasis by sponging miR-139-5p which had been reported was downregulated in human tumors.19 Our finding is consistent with previous studies.

1390
Integrin beta-8 (ITGB8) has been shown to be essential for tumor cell survival and serves as a target gene of miR-139-5p according to our data. As a master regulator of angiogenesis, ITGB8 has previously been reported to correlate with poor prognosis in various malignancies.20 In our study, we implicated for the first time that circ DNER promoted lung cancer proliferation, invasion and metastasis by modulating ITGB8 expression via sponging miR-139-5p, implying a novel regulatory axis formed by circ DNER /miR-139-5p/ITGB8 in lung cancer.
Exosomes are small endosomal-derived membrane microvesicles with a diameter of approximately 30-100 nm, which can be actively secreted by a variety of cells.21 A number of studies have demonstrated that exosomes are enriched in circRNAs, which may regulate tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion.22,23 Previous studies have shown that exosomal circ-ciRS122 mediates PKM2 in colorectal cancer cell lines and that plasma exosomal circ-PDE8A is associated with tumor invasion.11,24 Plasma exosomal circular RNA circ-RanGAP1 modulates VEGFA expression by targeting miR-877-3p to facilitate invasion and metastasis.14 In this study, we demonstrated that plasma exosomal circDNER transferred from lung cancer cells increased lung cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration, elucidating a novel mechanism of tumor metastasis in lung cancer. Moreover, our results demonstrated that plasma exosomal circ DNER can act as a tumor marker to distinguish between tumor patients and healthy people. Certainly, this conclusion needs further experimental and clinical studies to be confirmed.
