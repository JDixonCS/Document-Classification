IDENTIFICATION OF POISONOUS SNAKES.

To the Editor, " The Indian Medical Gazette."

Sir,?I shall feel much obliged if you or any of your learned readers would kindly enlighten me on the following:?1. Can bites of poisonous snakes be distinguished from those of innocent ones by their appearances 1 i.e., by the nature, number, and situation of punctures; 2. Supposing a person is bitten by a snake which is instantly killed, how can. it be known to be poisonous before any symptoms appear on the person bitten ? Can an examination of its jaw and mouth help in any way? The poisonous as well as some non-poisonous snakes have two fangs projecting from the sides of the jaw; their size of course varies in
different snakes. Are there any characteristic features
distinguising the poisonous from innocent ones? These two points are of considerable practical importance, and their knowledge is of essential service for early and effective treatment of snakebite.

Port Blair, j 12th Nocember, 1889. J

Yours obediently. SEA-SNAKE.
