COLIN CLOUT'S CALENDAR.

[FEB.

Colin Clout's Calendar.

By Grant Allen.
Windus: 1883.

London : Chatto &

Under this quaint title, we find another volume of sketches by Mr Grant Allen, similar in nature to the light, breezy papers by which he has made his name familiar to magazine readers. The Calendar is " the record of a summer, from April to October," as the title has it; and although our author certainly, by his own showing, trenches deeply on the autumn time, no one will grudge him the extension of his season. The papers included in this volume originally appeared in the St James's Gazette. Mr Allen chats pleasantly aboutu Wild Hyacinths," "Catkins and Almond Blossom," " Spring Flowers," " The Mole at Home," and other kindred subjects. He is always lively, and for the most part clear and entertaining. If there is any fault to be found with this, as with his other works, it is that they are somewhat sketchy, and leave the reader, often unqualified as he is, to fill in the pictures whose outlines Mr Allen draws. But if they stimulate a love of nature and of inquiry, as we think they do, such works show yeoman service in the cause of knowledge and its diffusion. For a leisure hour, there cannot be a better companion than Colin Clout's Calendar.
