Promotion of cytoplasmic localization of oligonucleotides by connecting cross-linked duplexes
Yu Hirano  and Yasuo Komatsu *
We previously reported that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) flanked by duplexes can suppress microRNA (miRNA) function with high efficiency for a long duration. In this study, we examined the effect of the double-stranded structure on the subcellular localization of ASOs. Double strands were cross-linked to prevent dissociation into single strands, and this cross-linked duplex (CD) was connected at the 50 or 30 termini of an antisense-targeting miRNA-21 (AS). The subcellular distribution of fluorescently labelled ASOs was analyzed following transfection into cells. While single-stranded AS molecules promptly moved to the nucleus, AS with the CD at the 50-end (50CD-AS) interestingly showed significantly higher cytoplasmic localization. The 30-CD-modified AS (30CD-AS) was degraded from the 50-end of the AS, but the degradation was prevented by 50-end chemical modifications, thereby allowing the imaging of the cytoplasmic localization. The CD modification significantly promoted the cytoplasmic localization of ASOs and enabled the effective knockdown of miRNA existing in cytoplasm. These results reveal that the duplex structure has promising potential to control the subcellular distribution of ASOs.

Introduction
Single stranded antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are widely used for controlling gene expression in a sequence-specic manner.1-3 ASOs are divided into two categories based on their functional mechanisms: Ribonuclease H1 (RNase H1)mediated RNA cleavage and steric blocking. Endogenous RNase H1 binds to an RNA-DNA heteroduplex and degrades the RNA4; however, fully 20-modied ASOs cannot induce RNase Hmediated RNA cleavage.5 Gapmer ASOs containing deoxynucleotides anked by several modied nucleotides on both ends can induce RNase H1-mediated RNA cleavage at the gap region.6 The 20-modications can improve ASO/RNA binding affinity and nuclease resistance.7 Among these gapmer ASOs, bL-locked nucleic acid (LNA) has attracted considerable interst.8,9 The phosphodiester (PO) backbone linkage in an ASO is also frequently replaced by a phosphorothioate (PS) linkage to enhance nuclease resistance and binding with various proteins, such as plasma proteins.10-14

internalization into the cells.16 PS-ASOs can be selectively delivered into liver hepatocytes by conjugation with N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNac), because asialoglycoprotein receptor mediates the uptake of GalNac-conjugated PS-ASOs into hepatocytes.3,17 However, the effects of intracellular distribution on ASO activity is not fully understood.15,16 The intracellular trafcking and localization of ASOs can be monitored using uorescence microscopy.18-20 Single-stranded PO-ASOs and PS-ASOs accumulate in the nucleus following lipofection or microinjection.18-20 In contrast, aer cells internalize gapmer PS-ASOs with LNA modications in the absence of transfection reagents, the PS-ASOs become localized in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm.19 Moreover, when gapmer PS-ASOs are introduced into cells without transfection reagents, ASO subcellular localization is affected by the 20-modications at both ends.15,21 Although the subcellular localization of PS-ASOs depends on different binding proteins,22,23 single-stranded PO-ASOs rarely interact with proteins in cells and are primarily distributed to the nucleus.18,24
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous noncoding RNAs (20-23 nucleotides) that regulate gene expression. In the nucleus, miRNAs are transcribed as pri-miRNA, and processed into a hairpin-shaped pre-miRNA. Next, the pre-miRNA is exported to the cytoplasm and one of the strands of the duplex associates with the Argonaute protein to form a miRNA-RISC complex that engages the target mRNA to mediate gene silencing.25,26 The discovery that miRNAs have important roles in various physiological processes and the pathogenesis of diseases26,27 has led to ASOs targeted toward miRNA, which are

also known as antagomiRs, antimir, or anti-microRNA oligonucleotides, to become an important tool for investigating miRNA function. ASOs bind to miRNA through complementary sequences, thereby inhibiting the function of the miRNA in cells.28-31 Additionally, the double-stranded duplexes anking the antimir improve the inhibitory effects.32-34 Recently, we constructed an ASO anked by an interstrand cross-linked duplex (CD) of 20-O-methylated RNA and found that the CD attenuated the anti-miRNA activity of the ASO.35 Compared with other structured ASOs, ASO anked by CDs at the 50- and 30termini (CD-AS) exhibit higher inhibitory activity in cells. For example, CD-AS effectively suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cells.36,37 In addition, the activity of CD-AS constructs is target-specic, and the expression level of PTEN mRNA, which is a target of miR-21, was shown to be upregulated by CD-AS in breast cancer cells.36 Moreover, antimiRNA activity, nuclease resistance, and the miRNA modication prole in a CD-AS differ signicantly based on the CDconnected positions in the ASO. However, the relationship between the inhibitory activity and subcellular distribution of ASOs has not been eluciated.
In this study, we investigated the effect of duplex structures on the subcellular localization of ASOs. The cytosol localization of AS having the CD at the 50 end was much larger than that of AS with the CD at the 30 end. Moreover, the cytoplasmic localization of ASOs targeted toward miRNA signicantly correlated with their miRNA inhibitory activities. These results suggest the importance of the duplex structure in controlling the subcellular localization of oligonucleotides.
Results and discussion
Subcellular localization of oligonucleotides with a CD at the 50- or 30-end
MicroRNA-21 (miR-21), a cancer-promoting miRNA, is overexpressed in solid tumors.38 The effect of miR-21 can be suppressed by an ASO that has a complementary sequence.36,39,40 We previously examined the anti-miRNA activities of 20-Omethylated ASOs in which a 22-mer antisense (AS) was anked by perfectly matched double-strand or a CD at the 50- or 30-end of the AS. The CD was constructed from the bis-aminooxy linker mediated conjugation of two abasic sites in the center of the complementary 12-mer duplex.35,41 The 12-mer 20-O-methylated CD adopted a typical A-form structure that was identical to the standard duplex of Watson-Crick base pairs. The rigid conformation of the CD confers the potential to be highly resistant to nucleases and to thereby stabilize neighboring hybridization. A 50CD-AS having the CD at 50-end of AS has been shown to knockdown miR-21 more efficiently than a 30CD-AS having the CD at 30-end,35 although the reason for the difference in the antimiRNA activity was unclear. In this study, we focused on the subcellular localization of ASOs with or without doublestranded structures. ASs having single strand (ss) (50ss-AS), double strand (ds) (50ds-AS), hairpin loop (hp) (50hp-AS) or CD (50CD1-AS) at the 50-end were prepared (Fig. 1, 50X-AS). All of these oligonucleotides were synthesized from 20-O-methyl ribonucleotides with phosphodiester internucleotide (PO)

linkages. The 50-end of the 34- or 50-mer strands containing an AS was labelled with a uorescein (Alexa-Fluor 546). We also prepared 50CD2-AS that contained the 30-end uorescein labelled 12-mer in the CD (Fig. 1) to examine the effect of the
labelling position.
These oligonucleotides were transfected into HeLa cells. Aer 6 h, ASO-transfected cells were stained with Hoechst 33342
and calcein-AM to image the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively. All uorescent images were analyzed using confocal microscopy (Fig. 2A and S1) aer 6 h transfection, when subcellular localizations of ASOs could be detected and almost all cells were viable (Fig. S1). We detected several red bright
foci (Fig. 2A) that showed endosomes or lysosomes as seen in the lipofection-mediated transfections.20,42 Based on the calcein-AM and Hoechst 33342 uorescence staining images (Fig. S1), the total uorescence intensities of Alexa-Fluor 546 in the nucleus and cytoplasm were quantied for approximately
100 cells, and the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization ratios of
each oligonucleotide were determined, respectively (Fig. 2B). An AS with single strand and double strand at the 50-end (50ss-AS and 50ds-AS) displayed approximately two-fold more total uo-
rescence intensity in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm

both 50- and 30-ends of the AS (Fig. S1). Although ss-AS had the same molecular weight as 50CD1-AS (46 nts), ss-AS had a high nucleus localization (66%) similar to that of 50ss-AS (Fig. 2B). Notably, 50CD1-AS displayed a distinctly different behavior in cells from that of 50ds-AS and 50hp-AS that contained the stan-
dard duplex, despite the similar molecular weights of 46 and 50
nts, respectively (Fig. 2B). This difference in subcellular locali-
zation was derived from the duplex structures adjacent to the AS. The CD of 50CD1-AS was stable in cells because of the interstrand cross-link, whereas the duplexes of 50ds-AS and 50hp-AS were dissociated or degraded to provide short single strands such as 50ss-AS (Fig. 2). The 50CD-AS maintained cyto-
plasmic localization 48 h aer transfection (Fig. S3); however, 50ss-AS and 50ds-AS signicantly reduced the uorescence
intensities in cells aer 6 h, due to the degradation. We then prepared 30ss-AS, 30ds-AS, 30hp-AS, 30CD1-AS, and
30CD2-AS, based on the 22 nt AS with ss, ds, hp, and CD at the 30end, respectively (Fig. 1, 30X-AS), and analysed their intracellular localizations (Fig. 2A and S1). Similar to 50-modied ASs, all 30-
modied ASs produced several bright red foci in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A); however, the uorescence intensities of 30ss-AS, 30dsAS, and 30hp-AS were very weak, suggesting degradation in cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, both 30CD1-AS and 30CD2-AS were
clearly detected in the nucleus with a localization ratio of approximately 65% (Fig. 2B). The 30CD-AS maintained nuclear localization 48 h aer transfection (Fig. S3). Interestingly, this result differed from that observed with 50CD-AS despite their
identical molecular weight. The AS sequence of 50CD2-AS and 30CD2-AS was then
changed to the mismatched AS (mAS), the AS of microRNA-16
(R16), and a scrambled sequence (NC), respectively (Fig. S2). The 50CD- or 30CD-linked oligonucleotides maintained the same localization prole as the parent molecule (50CD2-AS or 30CD2AS, Fig. S4), conrming that the AS sequence does not affect
the subcellular localization. Moreover, the AS sequence was shortened from 22 nts to 0 or 12 nts (CD, 50CD-12, 30CD-12; Fig. S2). The percentages of nucleus localization of 50CD-12 (36 nts) slightly increased to 49% (Fig. 3) from 30% of 50CD2-

The 50CD1-AS, with the CD at the 50-end, signicantly
decreased the nuclear localization ratio from approximately 73% for 50ss-AS to 41% (Fig. 2B). Additionally, the 50CD2-AS had a similar nuclear localization ratio (30%) as that of 50CD1-AS (Fig. 2B).

AS (46 nts). The CD (24 nts) without the dangling sequence showed a nucleus localization (65%, Fig. 3) as high as the singlestranded ss-AS (Fig. 2B). In contrast, 30CD-12 (36 nts) interestingly showed no change in the nucleus localization ratio from 30CD2-AS or CD (Fig. 3), with a different localization prole from 50CD-linked sequences that demonstrated a dependence on molecular weight.
50-End modications of single-stranded oligonucleotides
The intracellular localization of 30CD-linked single strands was independent of the length or the sequence of the dangling regions. Therefore, we hypothesized that the dangling AS region of 30CD-AS might be degraded from the 50-terminal without any protecting groups. Nuclease resistance was conferred to AS by attaching a non-nucleotidyl propyl (C3)- or an amino (NH2)linker to the 50-end to create 30CD-C3AS and 30CD-NH2AS, respectively (Fig. 4A). The subcellular localization of these oligonucleotides was then examined. Surprisingly, both 30CDC3AS and 30CD-NH2AS were dominantly localized in the

cytoplasm (Fig. 4B), reducing the nuclear localization ratios to
approximately 35% (Fig. 4C), which is the same as those of 50CD-AS. Additionally, the phosphodiester bond between the rst and second nucleotides (50UC30) of the AS was changed to
a PS bond, which is highly resistant to nuclease digestion, to create 30CD-psAS (Fig. 4A). Aer transfection into cells, 30CDpsAS was mainly detected in the cytoplasm, similar to 30CDC3AS, 30CD-NH2AS or 50CD-AS with a protected 50-end on the AS (Fig. 4B and C). The dangling AS of 30CD-AS may be degraded in the cytoplasm by a 50-30exonuclease such as XRN,43 resulting in
the production of the CD domain, i.e., which was nuclease
resistant due to the rigid conformation. Since the CD domain is localized in the nucleus, as shown in Fig. 3, 30CD-AS exhibited
localization in the nucleus. These results indicate that the protection from the 50-30 cleavage is an important factor for ensuring prolonged antisense effects in cells. To evaluate the effect of 50 -end modication on localization of a singlestranded oligonucleotide, the 50 -end of 30ss-AS was modied with a propyl-linker to create 30ss-C3AS (Fig. 4A). Although 30ssAS without the 50 -terminal protection could not provide images because of prompt degradation (Fig. 2A), 30ss-C3AS could be detected in the nucleus (Fig. 4B and C). As shown in Fig. 2, 50ssAS which had an Alexa-Fluor residue at the 50 -end, also
exhibited nuclear localization. Taken together, these results
indicated that single-stranded oligonucleotides became stable in cells because of 50 -end protection but they are delivered to the nucleus unlike 30CD-C3AS.
We then directly analysed the stability of oligonucleotides with or without 50 -end protection in the cytoplasm. Aer 50CD2AS, 30CD2-AS, and 30CD-C3AS were transfected into cells, their
respective cytoplasmic fractions were recovered, followed by polyacrylamide gel analysis. 50CD2-AS was intact (lane cyto in Fig. 5A and S5), 30CD2-AS was degraded, whereas most 30CD-
C3AS molecules remained stable in the cytoplasm with a small
number of degraded products (Fig. 5A). These results were
consistent with those derived from the imaging analyses. The stability of single-stranded 30ss-AS, 30ss-C3AS, and ss-AS was also examined. Most 30ss-AS molecules without 50-protection were degraded in the cytoplasm (Fig. S6). In contrast, 30ss-C3AS and ss-AS with the propyl and Alexa-Fluor residues at the 50-end (Fig. S6), respectively, were resistant to degradation. These results conrmed that a 50-end modication such as a CD or the
non-nucleotidyl linker could protect the single-stranded AS
region from degradation in the cytoplasm.

Inhibition of miRNAs is associated with cytoplasmic localization of ASOs
There was increased cytoplasm localization of 30CD-yASs (y ¼ C3, NH2, ps) due to the y-modications at the 50-end of the AS (Fig. 4). We then evaluated the anti-miRNA activities of the oligonucleotides 48 h aer transfection using a dual-luciferase assay. A target sequence complementary to the mature miR-21 was inserted into the 30-UTR of the Renilla luciferase (hRluc) gene of the psiCHECK-2 vector, which contained both hRluc and rey luciferase (Fluc) genes in a single plasmid. When the vector and ASOs are introduced into cells, the effects of

the cytoplasmic localization ratio of the ASOs. The miRNAs are
loaded into the Argonaute protein to form a miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC), which then binds the 30-UTR of mRNA in the cytoplasm.25,44,45 Therefore, the increase in ASO
concentration in the cytoplasm is advantageous for the associ-
ation between ASOs and their target miRNAs.
Fig. 6 summarizes these results. The dangling AS part of 30CD-AS was degraded in the cytoplasm, producing the CD
domain, which is resistant to nuclease degradation because of
the interstrand cross-linking. When the CD was transfected into
cells, the CD was translocated to the nucleus (Fig. 3). Thus, 30CD-AS was apparently localized in the nucleus (I in Fig. 6). Single-stranded ss-AS, 50ss-AS, and 30ss-C3AS with 50-end
protections were stable in the cytoplasm (II in Fig. 6) but most of them moved to the nucleus. Both 50CD-AS and 30CD-yAS (y ¼ C3, NH2 and ps) were stable in cytoplasm because of the CD and the y moiety at the 50-end of the AS and were suppressed from
migrating to the nucleus (III in Fig. 6). These localization proles increased the concentrations of 50CD-AS and 30CD-yAS in the cytoplasm, resulting in the effective knockdown of
miRNA acting in cytoplasm. Notably, 50CD-AS, 30CD-yAS, and ss-AS showed different
localization proles despite their identical molecular weight of 46 nts; therefore, the differences in localization were likely due to the differences in structure. A single-stranded oligonucleotide adopts a exible and compactly folded random-coil struc-
ture. As the result, a single-stranded oligonucleotide might pass
through nuclear pores from the cytoplasm. In contrast, the
single dangling strand may be preorganized to have an
extended form by the connection with a CD due to the rigid rodlike structure of the CD.46 Therefore, the CD-connected AS
having with a bulky conformation may be suppressed from been
translocated to the nucleus. These results suggest that the CD modication can promote the accumulation of single-stranded
ASOs in the cytoplasm.

endogenous miR-21 function can be monitored by measuring
the relative expression of hRluc and Fluc. The ratio of hRluc/
Fluc were normalized using the ratio of psiCHECK-2-treated cells without ASO. The 30CD2-AS without the 50-end modication displayed little suppression of miR-21, although 30CD-yASs could suppress miR-21 to the same degree as 50CD2-AS (Fig. 5B). The same results were also obtained for unlabelled 30CD-yASs (Fig. S7). Single-stranded 30ss-C3AS with a high nuclear localization ratio did not suppress miR-21. These results conrmed that the anti-miRNA effects of ASOs are closely associated with

Conclusions
Phosphorothioate (PS) linkages have been widely used to confer nuclease resistance to oligonucleotides.7 Since a PS linkage has a high affinity for protein, protein-binding greatly affects the intracellular function or distribution of PS-modied ASOs (PSASOs).10-12 Additionally, unfavorable protein-binding with PSASOs sometimes causes toxicological effects.22,47 In contrast, oligonucleotides with wild-type phosphodiester (PO) linkages have minimal interaction with proteins, but single-stranded POASOs are susceptible to nuclease digestion. Previously, we demonstrated that connecting the antisense sequence with a CD could overcome PO-ASOs instability.35
In this study, we examined the intracellular distributions of CD-connected ASs with PO-linkages. Aer transfection into cells, all single-stranded ASs promptly moved into the nucleus, whereas the CD-connected ASs were suppressed from such translocation, increasing the amount of CD-connected AS in the cytoplasm. We believe that CD-connected ASs would be advantageous in vivo by targeting RNAs existing in the cytoplasm. Importantly, dangling ASs with a free hydroxyl 50-terminal were susceptible to degradation in the cytoplasm. The AS instability was compensated for by introducing a CD or 50-end chemical modications. We propose that the AS will be organized to form an extended structure by connecting with the CD due to the rigid structure of this and the high stacking effect on the neighboring strand.46 The resultant extended conformation may contribute to suppression of the transportation of the oligonucleotide to the nucleus. In contrast, a single-stranded AS has a exible and random-coil structure that enables its rapid translocation to the nucleus.
Various types of RNAs localize differently in cells. If ASOs can be delivered to intracellular sites specic for target RNAs, dose and side-effects such as the off-targeting of ASOs, can be signicantly reduced. This study reveals that a stable duplex has the potential to regulate the intracellular distribution of oligonucleotides. Therefore, the results obtained here can provide important insights into controlling the localization of oligonucleotides in cells.
