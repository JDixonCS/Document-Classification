ABSTRACT To study the role of the Na,K-ATPase 13 subunit in the ion transport
activity, we have coexpressed the Bufo ~1 subunit (cd) with three different isotypes of [3 subunits, the Bufo Na,K-ATPase 131 ([31NaK) or [~3 (fl3NaK) subunit or the [3 subunit of the rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase ([3HK), by cRNA injection in Xenopus
oocyte. We studied the K÷ activation kinetics by measuring the Na,K-pump current induced by external K÷ under voltage clamp conditions. The endogenous oocyte Na,K-ATPase was selectively inhibited, taking advantage of the large difference in
ouabain sensitivity between Xenopusand Bufo Na,K pumps. The K÷ half-activation
constant (K1/2) was higher in the etl[33NaK than in the al[31NaK groups in the presence of external Na +, but there was no significant difference in the absence of external Na +. Association of ~1 and [3HK subunits produced active Na,K pumps with a much lower apparent affinity for K÷ both in the presence and in the absence
of external Na +. The voltage dependence of the K1/2for external K+ was similar
with the three [3 subunits. Our results indicate that the [3 subunit has a significant influence on the ion transport activity of the Na,K pump. The small structural differences between the [31NaK and 133NaK subunits results in a difference of the apparent affinity for K÷ that is measurable only in the presence of external Na ÷, and thus appears not to be directly related to the K+ binding site. In contrast, association of an ~1 subunit with a [3HK subunit results in a Na,K pump in which the K+ binding or translocating mechanisms are altered since the apparent affinity for external K+ is affected even in the absence of external Na +.
INTRODUCTION
The Na,K p u m p is composed of an a~ heterodimer. The two subunits are assembled soon after synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (Geering, 1990). Although neither hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) nor ion transport function by an isolated subunit has ever been demonstrated, the a subunit has been called the catalytic subunit because it includes the binding site for ATP (Pedemonte and Kaplan, 1990) and the catalytic phosphorylation site (Ohtsubo, Noguchi, Takeda, Morohashi, and Kawamura, 1990). In addition, several lines of evidence (site-directed mutagenesis, covalent binding of ouabain analogues) clearly indicate that the binding site of

ouabain, the Na,K pump-specific inhibitor, is primarily located on the ,x subunit; for review see Horisberger, Lemas, Kraehenbtihl, and Rossier (1991c). T h e [3 subunit has a major role in the maturation and the translocation of the Na, K-pump protein from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane; for review see Geering (1991). However, the role of this 13subunit, once the Na,K pump is in its mature and active form at the plasma membrane, is poorly understood.
The structure of the e~ subunit (with 8-10 putative transmembrane segments) and the existence of other ion-motive P-ATPases that do not include a 13subunit make it probable that the a subunit forms the binding sites and the pathway for the transported cations. However, the possibility of a contribution of the 13subunit (that includes only one transmembrane segment) is still open. A few recent reports point to this possible role (Eakle, Kim, Kabalin, and Farley, 1992; Schmalzing, Kr6ner, Schachner, and Gloor, 1992; Jaisser, Canessa, Horisberger, and Rossier, 1992a; Jaisser, Horisberger, and Rossier, 1992b; Lutsenko and Kaplan, 1992). In addition, selective chemical modifications of the [3 subunit of the gastric H,K-ATPase have been shown to entail loss of function of the holoenzyme (Chow, Browning, and Forte, 1992).
We have reported that the Xenopus [33NaK subunit, as well as the [31NaK isoform, could assemble with the ,xl subunit to form a functional Na,K pump at the plasma membrane of Xenopus oocytes but we were not able to detect any significant physiological differences between the aliB1NaK and ~1 [33NaK complexes (Horisberger, Jaunin, Good, Rossier, and Geering, 1991a). However, this approach was not powerful enough to detect small physiological differences between Na,K-pump isoforms expressed by cRNA injection, because the noise of the endogenous oocyte Na,K pump was added to the signal of the exogenous Na,K pump. More recently, using the Xenopus and Bufo e~and [3 subunits, we could show a consistent difference in the apparent affinity for external K+ between Na,K pumps including a [3 subunit of the [31 and [33 isotype. In the present paper, we have extended this work by studying the kinetics of the activation by external K+ of Na,K pumps composed of an ~x subunit and either one of the two known amphibian isoforms of the [3 subunit, [31NaK or [33NaK (Verrey, Kairouz, Schaerer, Fuentes, Geering, Rossier, and Kraehenbtihl, 1989; Good, Richter, and Dawid, 1990; Jaisser et al., 1992a), or the [3 subunit of the most closely related P-ATPase, the stomach H-K-ATPase; for review see Wallmark, Lorentzon, and Sachs (1990). In addition, the effects of the membrane potential and of the presence or absence of external Na + on apparent K+ affinity of all these isoforms was studied. The (x subunit of the Bufo marinus Na-K-ATPase was chosen because it is well expressed in Xenopus oocytes and it confers a relative resistance to ouabain, allowing the study of the function of the artificially expressed Bufo Na,K pump after selective inhibition of the endogenous Xenopus Na,K pump (Jaisser et al., 1992a, b).

METHODS
Expression of a and ~ Subunits cRNAs in Xenopus Oocytes
Synthetic cRNAs coding for the al subunit and [31NaK and [33NaK subunits of the Na,KATPase of Bufo marinus (Jaisser et al., 1992a), were prepared from cDNAs subcloned in pSD

JAISSER ET AL. 13 Subunit and Na,K-PumpFunction

vectors containing a 110-bp poly-A tail (Good, Welch, Barkan, Somasekhar, and Mertz, 1988).
Similarly cRNA coding for the 13 subunit of the rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase (Reuben, Lasater,
and Sachs, 1990) were prepared. Capped cRNAs were synthesized using SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega Corp., Madison, Wl) as described earlier (Melton, Krieg, Rebagliati, Maniatis, Zinn,
and Green, 1984; Horisberger et al., 1991a).
Stage V-VI Xenopusoocytes were obtained as previously described (Horisberger et al., 1991a)
and were injected with 10 ng of Na,K-ATPase et subunit cRNA and 1 ng of Na,K-ATPase 13
subunit, or 4 ng of H,K-ATPase 15 subunit cRNA in a total volume of 50 nl. We have shown
previously that co-injection of (~ and 131NaKor 133NaKcRNA of Bufo Na,K-ATPase induces a large increase in the activity of Na,K pumps at the surface of Xenopus oocytes, when compared
to oocytes injected with water, et subunit alone or I~ subunit alone (Jaisser et al., 1992a).
Similarly, co-injection ofXenopus Na,K-ATPase ct and rat gastric H,K-ATPase 13subunit cRNAs
was shown to result in the expression of functional Na,K-pump (Horisberger, Jaunin, Reuben, Lasater, Chow, Forte, Sachs, and Rossier, 1991b).

Electrophysiological Measurements of Na,K-Pump Activity
Na,K-pump activity was measured in Na÷-Ioaded oocytes as the outward current activated by addition of K+, in the presence of K+ channel blockers, as described earlier (Horisberger et al., 1991a). Briefly, 3-5 d after cRNA injection, the oocytes were first loaded with Na + by a 2-h exposure to a K+-free and Ca++-free solution. They were kept thereafter in a K+ free solution containing 0.4 mM Ca++ until the measurements were performed. Whole-cell currents were measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Current and voltage were recorded under voltage clamp conditions with a Dagan TEV-200 clamp instrument (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). The TL-1 DMA interface and Pclamp data acquisition program (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) were used to drive the voltage clamp and record voltage and current signals at a sampling rate of 1 KHz. The current signal was low-pass filtered at 25 Hz.
Whole-cell current-voltage (I-V) curves were obtained by recording the current while, starting
from a holding membrane potential of - 5 0 mV, rectangular voltage pulses (125 ms) of varying amplitude (from +80 to - 8 0 mV) were applied every 1.5 s and the steady state current was measured at 100 ms after the start of the voltage step.

Specific Measurement of the Exogenously Expressed Na,K Pump
To measure specifically the activity of the exogenous Bufo Na,K pumps we took advantage of the relative resistance to ouabain of the Bufo Na,K pump (K~ ~ 50 I~M)and its fast dissociation rate constant (Jaisser et al., 1992a) compared to the Xenopus Na,K pump (KI < 0.1 I~M)
(Canessa, Horisberger, Louvard, and Rossier, 1992). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the activity of the
endogenous Xenopus Na,K pump was inhibited by exposure for 1 min to 10 I~M ouabain. We have shown that this manoeuvre completely inhibits the XenopusNa,K pump for a period of at
least 15 min (Canessa et al., 1992; Jaisser et al., 1992a). Ouabain was then removed and a
4-8-min period was allowed for the recovery of the small part of the Bufo Na,K-pump activity
that could have been transiently inhibited by the 10 IxM ouabain (see Fig. 1).

Activation of the Na,K Pump by External Potassium
The activation of the Na,K-pump current by external K+ was studied in two separate sets of experiments, in the presence and in the nominal absence of external Na ÷. In the Na + containing solutions, the K+-induced current was measured after a stepwise increase of the K+ concentration from 0.0 to 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 raM. In the Na+-free solutions the K+ concentrations were 0.0, 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, and 5.0 raM. The various K+ concentrations were obtained by addition of adequate amounts of K-gluconate to the corresponding K+-free

The current induced by K+ at each potential was obtained by subtracting the current measured in the K+-free solution from the current measured in the presence of K÷. The parameters of the Hill equation:

I = Imax/[l + (KI/2/CK)"~]

(1)

were fitted to the data of the current (I) induced by various concentration of K+ (CK) and yielded least square estimates of the maximal current (/max), the half-activation constant (Kt/2, and the Hill coefficient (nil). The voltage dependence of Kl/~ was obtained by fitting the
parameters of the exponential function:

Kl/2 = KI/2(O)'exp(kFV/RT)

(2)

to the Kl:~vs. V,, data to obtain least square estimates of the K~/~at 0 mV [Kl:2(0)] and k, an
exponential steepness factor. A nonlinear fit program based on the simplex method (Nelder and Mead, 1965) was used for fitting equations to the data.
All experiments were performed at room temperature (24--26°C). Na, K-pump current measurements were restricted to oocytes showing a membrane resistance > 0.25 MI~. As no differences were observed in water-injected (50 nl) or noninjected oocytes, oocytes of these two groups were pooled to form the "control" group.

Solutions and Drugs
The composition of the solutions used for the electrophysiological measurements were as follows: Na+-containing solution (mM) Na ÷ 87, Ca ++ 0.41, Mg++ 0.82, Ba+÷ 5, TEA+ 10, gluconate 90, CI- 22.5, HCO~- 2.4, MOPS 10, pH 7.4; Na+-free solution (raM) Ca +÷ 0.41, Mg++ 0.82, Ba÷+ 5, TEA + 10, CI- 22.5, sucrose 140. Ouabain (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was added from a 0.2 M solution in dimethylsulfoxide for the low concentration (10 ~M) solutions, and was directly dissolved in the final solution for the 2 mM concentration. Results are expressed as mean -+ SE ( n - - n u m b e r of observations). The statistical significance of differences between means was estimated using Student's t test for unpaired data. P < 0.05 was chosen as the level of statistical significance.

RESULTS
Expression of Exogenous Na,K Pumps
Coinjection o f ~t a n d [3 subunit cRNAs r e s u l t e d in the e x p r e s s i o n o f a large exogenous Na,K-pump activity in all groups. Fig. 2 shows that the current due to exogenous Na,K pumps (i.e., the current measured after inhibition of the endogenous Na,K pump) was four to six times higher in the 0tlfllNaK and alJ33NaK groups, and about twice higher in the ~tll3HK group than the current due to the endogenous Na,K pump, i.e., the current measured in noninjected oocytes before exposure to ouabain. In noninjected oocytes no ouabain sensitive current could be detected after exposure to 10 ~M ouabain for 1 min. All the means values of the groups of cRNA-injected oocyte are significantly different from 0 (P < 0.005 in each case). In earlier experiments in which ouabain binding was measured in paralell with the activity, we have shown that the Na,K-pump current measured at -50 mV in the presence of 10 mM K ÷ was highly correlated with the number of ouabain binding sites and thus is a reliable estimate of the number of Na,K-pump expressed at the surface of the oocyte (Jaunin, Horisberger, Richter, Good, Rossier, and Geering,

610

THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY · VOLUME 103 · 1994

1992). A similar relationship between the number of ouabain binding sites and Na,K-pump current (or ouabain-sensitive rubidium uptake) was observed when cdNaK alone, al{31NaK and alI3HK were compared (Horisberger et al., 1991b). Therefore, the lower activity in the cd{3HK group can most probably be attributed to the lower level of expression, possibly due to a less efficient assembly between the amphibian Na, K-ATPase a l subunit and the mammalian H,K-ATPase {3 subunit (Horisberger et al., 1991b).

Ouabain-sensitive and Potassium-induced Currents

Fig. 3 shows the results of experiments performed in the presence of external sodium. The main source of variation in the current values was related to the level of expression of active Na,K pump. Therefore all current values were normalized to the ouabain-sensitive current measured in the presence of 10 mM K+ at - 5 0 mV (mean values indicated in Fig. 2). The upper panel shows the current sensitive to 2 mM

ouabain in the presence of 10 mM K+ (corresponding to the subtraction of the I-V curves e m i n u s f o f Fig. 1). In all groups the voltage dependence of the Na,K-pump current was marked at negative potentials ( ~ 50% decrease of the ouabain-sensitive current between - 5 0 and - 1 3 0 mV) similarly to what has been described in earlier reports in oocyte (Rakowski and Paxson, 1988; Schweigert, Lafaire, and Schwarz, 1988; Wu and Civaa, 1991) or other cell types (Horisberger and Giebisch, 1989; Rakowski, Gadsby, and De Weer, 1989; Gadsby and Nakao, 1989; Stimers, Shigeto, and Lieberman, 1990). The voltage dependence tended to be smaller at depolarized membrane potentials, especially for the endogenous pump and for the cxl{3HK group. This can be explained by the lower apparent affinity of K+ for these cx/{3 complexes in the depolarized potential range (see below). K+ concentrations higher than 10 mM could not be used because significant ouabain-resistant K+-induced currents appeared at K+ concentrations > 10 mM. The middle panel shows that currents induced by 10 mM K+ were of similar magnitude and had a similar voltage

dependence as the ouabain-sensitive current. The lower panel shows the current induced by 10 mM K+ in the presence of 2 mM ouabain (corresponding to the subtraction of the I-V curvesfminus g of Fig. I). The size of this current amounted to a few percent of the ouabain-sensitive current in the presence of 10 mM K+. For the cRNA-injected oocytes a small residual Na,K-pump current was expected because of the high KI of ouabain for the Bufo Na,K p u m p (Jaisser et al., 1992a). Assuming a KI of 50 CM and simple one-site inhibition kinetics, 2 mM ouabain should inhibit 97.6% of the total current. From these results we conclude that the K+-induced currents were essentially due to activation of the Na,K-pump.
Fig. 4 shows the results of similar measurements performed in the absence of external Na +. T h e ouabain-sensitive current (upper panel) was slightly voltage sensitive in the negative potential range (~ 20% decrease of the ouabain-sensitive current between - 5 0 and - 1 3 0 mV). Although smaller than that observed in the presence of external Na ÷, this voltage dependence was statistically significant and similar in all groups. Gadsby, Rakowski, and De Weer (1993) have shown that the external Na ÷ binding step is the main voltage-dependent step of the sodium translocating part of the pump cycle, and Rakowski, Vasilets, LaTona, and Schwarz (1991) have shown that the apparent affinity of K+ was also voltage dependent. The presence of a voltage dependence in the absence of external Na + and at saturating K+ concentration suggests that there is another voltage-dependent step in the cycle. Except for the ~I~INaK group for which the K+-induced current was voltage independent, there was a small increase of the K+-induced current in the high negative potential range. As the effect of K÷ in the presence of ouabain was negligible (lowerpanel), the discrepancy between the ouabain-sensitive current (upper panel) and the current activated by 5 mM K+ (middle panel), at negative membrane potentials, correspond to the presence of a small ouabain-sensitive inward current in the absence of external Na + and K+. A similar ouabain-sensitive current has been observed by Rakowski et al. (1991) and has been investigated in more detail by Efthymiadis, Rettinger, and Schwarz (1993). The nature of this current is unknown.

Potassium Activation of the Na,K-Pump Current in the Absence and the Presence of External Sodium
The voltage dependence of the current activated by different concentrations of K+ (corresponding to the subtraction of the I-V curves b--d minus curve a of Fig. I) in the presence and in the absence of external Na + are shown in Fig. 5. Current values were normalized to the ouabain-sensitive current measured in the presence of the highest K+ concentration at - 5 0 inV.
Potassium activation kinetics were obtained for each membrane potential value by fitting the parameters of the Hill equation (/max, Kl/~, Hill coefficient) to the K+-induced current vs K+ concentration data for each oocyte (see examples in Fig. 6). T h e Hill coefficients (n·) were in the range of 1.5-2.0 for the experiments performed in the presence of Na +, and in the range of 0.9-1.3 for the experiments in the absence of Na +. T h e r e was no obvious voltage d e p e n d e n c e of n~ obtained by parameter fitting in either case.

two remaining parameters (/max and K1/z) yielded essentially similar results concerning the Kl/2 estimates.
The voltage dependence of the K1/2of the activation of the Na,K-pump current by
external K+ is shown in Figs. 7 and 8. In the absence of external Na + (Fig. 7) the apparent K+ affinity was increasing monotonicly with the membrane potential in all groups. In the noninjected oocyte group, the voltage dependence of the Kl/2 was similar to that observed under similar conditions by Rakowski et al. (1991), with an exponential steepness factor of 0.36 +- 0.05 (n = 6). In the etl[31NaK and ctl133NaK
groups the steepness factor of the voltage dependence of KI/2 was 0.21 - 0.02
(n = 8) and 0.22 + 0.02 (n = 8), respectively (no significant difference between these two groups). Both these values were significantly smaller than in the noninjected
group (P < 0.005). Although the KI/2values were similar at high negative membrane potentials, the K1/2at + 10 mV was much higher in the noninjected grou,p (632 + 62
p,M) than in the 0tll31NaK (241 -+ 19 I~M) and etl133NaK groups (234-+ 15 IzM)
(P < 0.001). The K1/2values were similar in the 131NaK and in the [33NaK groups.
No significant difference could be established at any potential value. The etl[3HK
group had a much higher KI/2 over the whole potential range, with a voltage
dependence, k of 0.27 + 0.06 (n = 7), a value not significantly different from those of the ~tllMNaK and ctl133NaK groups.
In the presence of Na ÷ (Fig. 8), the activation by external K÷ presented a different type of voltage dependence. In all groups, both hyperpolarization and depolarization tended to decrease the apparent affinity of K+ for activation of the pump current, with a maximal apparent affinity around -50 to -30 mV. This indicates that the voltage dependence of the apparent affinity of K÷ results not only from a voltagedependent step in the binding of K+, but also from another step with a reverse voltage dependence, presumably the binding/release of external Na + (Gadsby et al., 1993). Again the etll3HK group had a higher KI/2 than the other groups. The ctl[31NaK group had a significantly lower affinity for K+ than the etl[~3NaK, (P < 0.02 or smaller for each potential value) and this difference was larger in the high negative potential range.

DISCUSSION
In this p a p e r we have extended the previous finding by us (Jaisser et al., 1992a,b) and others (Schmalzing et al., 1992; Eakle et al., 1992) that the structure of the 13 subunit has an influence on the function of the Na,K pump present at the plasma membrane, and more specifically on the apparent affinity of potassium for its external binding site. The Na,K pump is a transport system that undergoes a complex cycle with at least two conformations, one of which (the E2 conformation)

of 10 mM K÷ are plotted against the membrane potential (Vm).(Top)Current sensitive to 2 mM ouabain in the presence of 10 mM K+ (corresponding to the subtraction of current recordings f minus e of Fig. 1).

has a high affinity for external K÷ ions. The apparent affinity of K+, which we measure as the KI/2, will generally be different from the intrinsic affinity (Kin) of the E2 conformation (L~iuger, 1991). In principle, modifications of the K1/2 could result from a change of the Km as well as from other alterations in the kinetics of the p u m p cycle. T o investigate the role o f the [3 subunit in the N a , K - p u m p function, we have examined the potassium activation kinetics of Na,K-pump heterodimers including different 13 subunits u n d e r two conditions, in the presence and in the absence o f external Na +, and over a wide range o f m e m b r a n e potential.
The most striking difference between pumps including [31NaK and [33NaK isoforms was the a p p a r e n t affinity for K + measured in the presence of external Na +. No difference could be detected in the absence of external Na + over the whole potential range. In contrast, a much lower apparent affinity for K+ was observed with the al[3HK complex both in the presence and in the absence o f external Na +.
To analyze the difference of the apparent affinity for K+ and its relation to the intrinsic affinity, we have used a simple three-state kinetic model of the Na,K-pump cycle that is described in the Appendix. In this model the a p p a r e n t affinity, KI/2 is related to the intrinsic Km by the following relation (Eq. A8 in the Appendix):

fl +bl

K1/2 = Km-f~ + f 2

(3)

T h e large difference of K1/2 observed between the a l [31NaK and the a l [3HK groups was of roughly similar magnitude in the presence and in the absence of external Na +, and at all tested membrane potentials. The most simple explanation for this uniform difference u n d e r various conditions is an alteration of the intrinsic Kin, which appears as a factor in the right side of Eq. 3.
The absence of detectable difference between the c~l[31NaK and the al[33NaK g r o u p s in the absence o f external Na + makes it very unlikely that the intrinsic Km was altered. If the change of the apparent affinity observed in the presence of Na + has to be attributed to the modification of a single rate constant, an increase of the rate constant b 1 (i.e., the backward Na + translocating step) in the al133NaK group could explain both the higher Kl/z in the presence of external Na + and the absence of difference in Na+-free external solutions. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the difference of KI/2 increases at negative membrane potential. Indeed, as the rate of the backward Na + translocating step (b l) increases at negative membrane potentials, owing to the voltage dependence of external Na + binding (Gadsby et al., 1993), the influence o f b l on t h e f l + bl term increases. It is, however, obvious that more complex modifications, concerning several rate constants could also produce these results.

The 13 subunit might be involved in the function of the Na,K p u m p because the transmembrane segment of the [3 peptide chain participates directly in the structure of cation binding or occlusion sites, as suggested by Capasso, Hoving, Tal, Goldshleger, and Karlish (1992). Alternatively, the [3 subunit, by its close interaction with the c~ subunit, might modify the structure of the c~ protein a n d / o r the equilibrium between different conformational states of this subunit. Comparison of the primary sequence of a large number of [3 subunit isoforms (Horisberger et al., 1991c) indicate that the overall structure is well conserved: a short intracellular amino-terminal sequence is followed by one transmembrane segment and a large extracytoplasmic carboxy-terminal domain. A striking difference is the presence in the [31 isoform of a stretch of 15-20 amino acids (corresponding to exon 5) that is not present in the other [3 isoforms. The differences between [3HK and the other [3 isoforms are more substantial (about 30% identity) and widespread throughout the whole sequence. Studies using chimeric [3 subunits formed from different isoforms may allow us to determine more precisely which parts of the [3 protein are involved in the functional differences that we have observed, and help to delineate functional domains of the 13 subunit.
Although the presence of c~ and 133NaK subunits has been shown in Xenopus oocytes (Jaunin et al., 1992), the exact isoform composition of the protein forming active Na,K pumps at the plasma membrane of this cell type has not yet been determined. Our results obtained with noninjected oocytes show that the function of the endogenous Na,K pump is clearly different from either that of the cxl[31NaK or the cxl[33NaK complexes. In particular, the voltage dependence of the apparent affinity for K+ is nearly twice as steep for the endogenous than for the ~xl[31NaK or cd [33NaK pumps. The reasons for this difference are not clear. Species differences do not seem to be the explanation since Xenopus cd[31NaK or ~l[33NaK complexes expressed in oocytes by cRNA injection also show a higher apparent affinity for K+ when compared to endogenous Na,K-pumps studied in non injected oocytes (unpublished results). The existence of an oocyte specific ~ subunit isoform might explain the difference in K+ affinity. Deletions of the amino-terminal part of the ~ subunit have been shown to alter the apparent affinity for K+ (B/Jrgener-Kairuz, Horisberger, Geering, and Rossier, 1991), and more specifically the voltage dependence of the apparent K+ affinity (Vasilets, Omay, Ohta, Noguchi, Kawamura, and Schwarz, 1991). The importance of the amino terminus is further suggested by the presence of a distinct transcript of the ~1 isoform in the oocyte and during early development (Bfirgener-Kairuz, personal communication).
In conclusion, our results point to an important role of the [3 subunit in the

A T P a s e 133 s u b u n i t i n d u c e s a d e c r e a s e o f t h e a p p a r e n t affinity t h a t is m o s t likely d u e to alterations of the Na + translocation kinetics rather than to a direct alteration of the K + binding site.

APPENDIX
To analyze the relation between the intrinsic affinity (Kin) and the apparent activation constant (Ki/2), we used a simple steady-state kinetic model of the Na, K-pump cycle. As illustrated in Fig. 9, this model includes three states: El, E2, and E2K. An equilibrium binding kinetic with an intrinsic affinity K,, links the E2 and E2K states. The pseudomonomolecular rate constantsfl and bl represent the step during which, according to the Post-Albers model, Na + ions are released (forward: fl) or bound (backward: bl). The f2 rate constant summarizes all the other steps of the cycle between the E2K and the E1 state. The backward rate constant of the E2K to E 1 step is assumed to be slow compared to the other rate constants and is set to 0. The bI rate constant is equal to 0 in the absence of external Na + and has a finite value in the presence of Na +. From published data (Rakowski et al., 1991; Gadsby et al., 1993), b o t h bl and Km are expected to be voltage dependent. The observed voltage dependence of the ouabain-sensitive current in the absence of external Na ÷ (Fig. 3, top) suggests that e i t h e r f l or f 2 are also voltage dependent. It should be noticed that the E1 and E2 states do not have exactly the same meaning as they do in the Post-Albers model.
