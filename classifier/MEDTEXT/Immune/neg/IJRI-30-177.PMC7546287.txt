Abstract
The superiorinferior ventricle is a rare anomaly with the unknown incidence owing to less number of reported cases. However, one of the studies has reported this incidence to be <0.1% of all congenital heart diseases. This has a characteristic imaging appearance with horizontal interventricular septum. Most of the previous reports of superiorinferior ventricles have been described on echo, catheter angiography and only a few with crosssectional imaging. We report two cases of superiorinferior ventricles associated with complex congenital cardiac defects on dualsource CT.
Key words: Congenital heart disease; horizontal interventricular septum; superoinferior ventricles

Introduction
The term superiorinferior ventricles (SIV) implies that the interventricular septum (IVS) is horizontal with the ventricles lying on above each other instead of side by side. It is also known as upstairsdownstairs ventricles and depending on the morphology, it can be either right ventricle (RV) on top or left ventricle (LV) on top. It is a rare anomaly and the exact incidence is unknown. However, TaksandeAM[1] has reported the incidence to be <0.1% of all congenital heart diseases [CHDs]. Most of the cases reported in the literature are of RV on top morphology and Porras et al.[2] has infact described the LV on top morphology for the first time in 2003. Since then there are quite a few cases of SIV which are reported in the literature with LV on top morphology. While most of the reported cases in the literature have projected SIV on echocardiography and catheter angiography,[15] we present two cases of complex

congenital heart diseases having associated SIV (RV on top morphology), deciphered on dualsource CT (DSCT).

Case History

Case 1 First patient was an 8yearold boy with cyanosis. CT scan showed situs solitus with levocardia. Both the ventricles were situated superoinferiorly with horizontal IVS [Figure 1]. The ventricle on top was of RV morphology with both great vessels arising from it (double outlet RV) [Figure 2]. There was a subaortic ventricular septal defect (VSD). Pulmonary stenosis with confluent pulmonary arteries was noted. There was malpositioned great arteries with aorta anteriorly and left of the main pulmonary artery [Figure 3]. Coronaries were normal.

Case 2 Second patient was a 15yearold male with cyanosis. CT scan showed situs solitus with levocardia. Both atria were connected to anteroinferiorly placed ventricle which was

of RV morphology. Morphological LV, which was placed posterosuperiorly [Figure 4] had no atrial connection. There was complete transposition of great vessels with aorta arising from morphological RV and pulmonary artery from morphological LV. Subaortic VSD was present [Figure 5]. Pulmonary stenosis with confluent pulmonary arteries was noted [Figure 6]. The associated rightsided aortic arch was also seen.

SIV is generally associated with other complex type of congenital heart diseases. However, Yang et al.[4] described cases with SIV being the only abnormality. Morphogenesis of this anomaly is a debatable topic with most of the recent literature suggestive of postseptational defect. Angelini et al.[3] suggested it to be a deformed mid-distal IVS and ventricles to a variable degree in addition to clockwise rotation of apical ventricular segments with normal atrioventricular valves and ventricular inlets, hence suggested the term "apical malrotation syndrome". Angelini et al.[3] also stated that crisscross heart and SIV are

different structural anomalies that may coexist depending on the clockwise or anticlockwise rotation of the apical structures.

Earlier generation CTs often produced images of suboptimal diagnostic quality. Newer generation CTs with improved temporal resolution produces excellent quality images so that all the associated defects can be depicted accurately. Better quality volume rendered CT images (VRT) can be produced, which depict this particular morphology accurately. In these cases, the images were acquired on DSCT (Siemens Somatom Force) with retrospective ECG gating and phasewise reconstruction. VRT images were generated with a bone subtraction algorithm. No premedication or sedation was required in these patients. These images accurately depict the complex anatomy as shown in the images and VRT images nicely show the SIV morphology.

SIV is a rare form of CHD, which is generally associated with another complex type of cardiac defect. With the latest development of CT scanners, accurate depiction of cardiac anomalies can be demonstrated and the latest reconstruction algorithms enable us to generate good quality VRT images as seen in our cases.
