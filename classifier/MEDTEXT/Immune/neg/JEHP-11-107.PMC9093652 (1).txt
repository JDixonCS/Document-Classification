Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Nurses are in close contact with COVID19 patients and due to the high risk of infection, they experience fear and anxiety that can result in burnout. This study aimed to review the studies on burnout among nurses during the COVID19 epidemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study followed the guideline for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Metaanalysis (PRISMA). Using the keywords: "burnout," "nurse," and "COVID19" and with the help of Boolean operators, "AND" and "OR" the online databases, namely PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Science Direct were searched. Articles published from the first of February 2020 to 30 October, 2020 were retrieved. After the quality appraisal, the required data were extracted and analyzed.
RESULTS: Out of 85 articles identified in the initial search, and after removing duplicates and those that did not have the required data, seven articles entered the analysis. Among these articles, four (57.14%) reported moderate burnout and three articles (42.86) reported high level of burnout among nurses during the COVID19 pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: A majority of the studies reported that nurses experienced a moderate level of burnout during the COVID19 pandemic. Given the prevalence of burnout in nurses and because nurses are the largest portion of the healthcare providers who are in close contact with patients infected by COVID19, it is necessary for health care policymakers to adopt strategies for preventing or reducing burnout among nurses.
Keywords:
COVID19, job burnout, nurse

Introduction
On January 30, 2019, the World Health Organization announced the outbreak of a public health emergency and international concern[1] called coronavirus2019 (COVID19) which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.[2] In December 2019,[3] the COVID19 disease has emerged in Wuhan, China, and is spreading rapidly worldwide.[4] The COVID19 epidemic is now considered a global public health emergency.[2,5,6] Health care

workers, especially nurses who are in close contact with these patients, are at high risk of this infection and therefore, experience fear, anxiety, depression, and burnout.[7] Among health care workers, nurses make up the largest portion of the health care providers[8] and have always played an important role in infection prevention, infection control, isolation, containment, and public health.[4,9] When nurses are exposed to workplaces with high job demands and low resources, they experience symptoms of physical and emotional stress that consequently would affect their health.[9] In addition,

the COVID19 epidemic, and had been published from the first of February 2020-October 30, 2020.

Health professionals who care for COVID19 patients experience severe stress that can lead to burnout and decreased capacity to continue working.[11] Burnout has been described as a dangerous condition resulting from overwork and chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. It can lead to physical or mental illness.[2] Burnout can not only induce negative emotions but can also diminish positive emotions.[12] A study of health care professionals has shown a direct significant relationship between stress and burnout.[13] Another study revealed that during the COVID19 epidemic, physicians and nurses suffer from mental health problems, including burnout[14] due to the physical, mental, and social pressures they experience in the workplace.[11]
Because of the special nature of the nursing profession, clinical nurses experience different degrees of burnout. On the other hand, the fight against COVID19 is a big challenge; and the burnout of nurses caring for patients with COVID19 may not be the same as burnout experienced in other workrelated conditions.[2,15] Sporadic reports published on the prevalence of burnout among nurses who care for patients with COVID19 reported different rates. [16,17] Therefore, this study aimed to provide a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of burnout among nurses who cared for patients with COVID19.
Materials and Methods
A systematic review design was conducted in 2020 on studies that investigated the prevalence of burnout among nurses who cared for patients with COVID19. The study is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses guidelines.
Search strategy Relevant studies were identified through electronic searches of PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Science Direct. The snowballing method of searching the bibliographies of retrieved references was applied to identify relevant articles. The articles were screened first of February 2020-October 30, 2020. No language restrictions were imposed.

Study selection Twice reviewers screened titles and abstracts of all retrieved records for duplication. Full texts of all potentially relevant studies were then independently studied to determine the final study selection. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Duplicate information on the same patients was combined to obtain complete data.
Data extraction Study characteristics were extracted from eligible articles: Authors/Country/Year, Design and Method, Sampling, Sample size/Age group or mean age, Instrument used, Analysis methods, Important findings, The prevalence/severity of burnout among nurses, and P value.
Data synthesis Search results (n = 85) were exported to the EndNote software (v. X7) and two researchers independently screened their titles and abstracts to identify duplicate records. The reference lists of eligible articles were also handsearched for additional studies. Then, two reviewers independently appraised the quality of the retrieved studies using a checklist including the research method, validity, and reliability of data collection instruments, the sample size, and the absence of bias in data collection and statistic test and software.
A data collection form was used to extract data on the following items from the retrieved articles: Author, publication year, country, study design, sample size, sampling method, main results, burnout prevalence, level of significance, and conclusion. Figure 1 presents the process of the study. Table 1 shows levels of nurse's burnout during the COVID19 pandemic and Table 2 refers to a summary of the characteristics and the quality indicators of the included studies.
Ethical consideration To extract data from the mentioned articles, all ethical principles related to competing essays were observed. No attempt was made to obtain ethical approval due to the lack of sample collection and interview.
Discussion

Direct were searched using the following keywords: "burnout," "nurse," and "COVID19." Boolean operators, "AND" and "OR" were used to narrow or broaden search results. Articles were included if they were the reports of original researches, were in English, included data on the prevalence of burnout among nurses during

Four out of seven articles reviewed in the present study reported that nurses experienced a moderate level of burnout during the COVID19 pandemic and three articles reported high levels of burnout among nurses in the same period. Due to their responsibility for human health, continual confrontation with patients , [18]

performing clinical procedures, exposure to dying patients, dealing with emergency, and unpredictable situations, and exposure to too much noise at the workplace, nurses are exposed to high levels of work pressure.[19-21] Epidemiological studies have shown that about 17%-41% of nurses in different countries have symptoms of depression and approximately 20%-40% of them have symptoms of anxiety.[2,22] Anxiety and depression overlap with burnout. Burnout may also exacerbate negative emotions. Work pressure along with depression and anxiety would exacerbate job burnout.[12] Although nurses experience degrees of anxiety and depression during the COVID19 pandemic, anxiety has a greater effect on job burnout. A study also showed that each additional patient added to a nurse's workload was associated with a 23% increase in the probability of burnout.[4] Because burnout has a serious impact on nurses' mental health and work capacity,[2] and by reporting that 15.6% of nurses experience burnout, the Joint Commission for Quick safety advisory on Combating Nurse Burnout emphasized that organizations should remove barriers to nurses' workflow and workplace environment concerns to decrease the rate of burnout among them.[23] Nonetheless, selfcontrol and regulation of emotions are important in the handling of burnout and resolving difficult and anxiogenic workplace issues.[24] Consistently, studies reported that flexibility and feeling of selfefficacy as well as the effective use of organizational resources improve mental health, reduce anxiety, depression, and burnout among frontline nurses, and help them be prepared for stressful and difficult situations.[4,25] Some studies also showed that using stress management techniques, adequacy of hospital resources for the treatment of patients with COVID19, and support received from family, friends, colleagues, and superiors

can help reduce stress and burnout in nurses during the COVID19 epidemic.[17,24,26] Furthermore, the availability of mental health professionals for psychological counseling, social support, and protective measures for nosocomial infections can prevent burnout in nurses or help reduce it.[3,24] Studies also confirmed the role of a balance between rest and activity, good nutrition and exercise, personal hobbies, entertainment, and timely vacations in the reduction of chronic stress, anxiety, and burnout in employees, especially when they feel overwhelmed.[24] Therefore, nursing managers and hospital authorities should pay more attention to health care workers, - especially nurses - and design longterm preventive plans, reduce working shifts, and find the sources of stress and resolve them to manage not only the ongoing outbreak but also to control future pandemics.[17]
Limitations and recommendation Limited studies have been published on the prevalence of burnout among nurses in the COVID19 pandemic. The results of these studies might not be generalized. Therefore, further studies should be conducted in this area.
Conclusion
A majority of the studies reviewed reported that nurses experienced a moderate level of burnout during the COVID19 pandemic. Given the prevalence of burnout in nurses and its consequences, and because nurses are the largest group of the health care providers in service of patients with COVID19, it is necessary for health care policymakers to adopt appropriate strategies and methods to prevent or reduce burnout among nurses. Increasing personal protection equipment, providing alternative workforce, and periodic rotation of frontline nurses, providing adequate organizational, and social support, and ensuring their willingness to work as frontline can help prevent or reduce burnout among nurses.
