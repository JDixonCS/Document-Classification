ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Numerous studies have been conducted on the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, how the mental health of health workers will be affected among the number of peaks during the pandemic has not been evaluated yet. The study aims to investigate the effects of the first, second, and third peaks of COVID-19 on anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms in healthcare workers. METHODS: The current study included 4031 healthcare workers, 1051 during the first peak period, 1409 during the second peak period, and 1571 during the third peak period. The Depression Anxiety Stress scale21(DASS-21) was used to assess the participants' levels of anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 33.74 ± 7.95, and 2634 (66.3 %) were female. 36.9 %(n = 1486) of the participants were physicians, 41.1 % (n = 1655) were nurses and 22.1 % (n = 890) were other healthcare workers. A statistically significant difference was documented in the DASS-21 anxiety (F(2:4028) = 502.893, p < 0.001, Post-hoc = 3. Peak > 2. Peak > 1. Peak), DASS-21 depression (F(2:4028) = 46.034, p < 0.001, Post-hoc = 3. Peak > 2. Peak > 1. Peak), DASS-21 stress (F(2:4028) = 65.548, p < 0.001, Post-hoc = 3. Peak = 2. Peak > 1. Peak), and DASS-21 total scores (F(2:4028) = 156.860, p < 0.001, Post-hoc = 3. Peak > 2. Peak > 1. Peak) of healthcare workers during all three peak periods. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that as the peak number rises, so do the levels of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers. As a result, it is possible to assert that prolongation of the COVID-19 pandemic worsens mental problems (Tab. 2, Fig. 3, Ref. 35). Text in PDF www.elis.sk KEY WORDS: anxiety, COVID-19, depression.

Introduction
Despite the development of vaccines for COVID-19 infection, the pandemic has still significant health, economic, and social consequences for many people (1). Many studies have shown that COVID-19 has negative mental effects on both patients and healthy people (2). It is foreseen that if the pandemic is prolonged, these effects will have devastating consequences (3). It is obvi-

ous that the social and economic consequences of the pandemic process affect all societies, including developed countries (4, 5). Furthermore, it is certain that the feelings of loneliness, boredom, irritability, restlessness, anger, anxiety, sadness, worry, and family problems, which continue to rise as a result of measures such as school closure, quarantine, exacerbate mental problems (6). Individuals who live far away from their families and loved ones for reasons such as education or work, as well as the elderly who live alone, are more likely to develop mental disorders such as depression and anxiety (7). It is not hard to predict that if the pandemic is prolonged, mental health problems will get worse.
The fact that the number of cases and official records from around the world can be shared online has revealed that the number of cases in various countries fluctuates, with ups and downs and peaks (8). Following the spread of COVID-19 in March 2020, various countries experienced their second and even third peak in their history. As a result, numerous studies have been conducted to investigate possible mood swings between these various peaks (9, 10). The studies focused on the peak periods of the number of cases and the examinations of healthcare workers on mental health through variables such as burnout, somatic symptoms,

health status, job satisfaction, and the anxiety and depression levels of the general population (11, 12). The results show that negative mental symptoms generally increase in the second peak periods when compared to the first peak periods (10, 13). In a study conducted with Italian nurses, there was no significant difference in anxiety levels between the two peak waves, but there was a significant increase in depression levels between the two peaks (9). We completed and published a study that compared the first two peaks of this study. In the first part of our study, we concluded that the second peak, when the number of cases of healthcare workers in our country increased again, resulted in significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress than the first peak (10). To summarize, the differences between the peaks indicate that the peaks also have mental health reflections. Besides, studies on the mental effects of COVID-19 peaks in the literature tend to focus on the differences between the two peaks. This is most likely due to the fact that most countries have experienced two peaks. However, despite the fact that there are countries with three peaks, there has been no research on the mental effects of these peaks that we know.
In light of all of this information, the aim of this study is to compare the anxiety, depression, and stress levels of healthcare workers in three different peaks as a follow-up to the study that

compared the anxiety, depression, and stress levels of healthcare professionals in two peaks.
Material and methods
Participants The sample of the current cross-sectional study consists of
the doctors, nurses, and healthcare assistants working in the COVID-19 related units during the peak periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study included 4031 healthcare workers, 1051 during the first peak period, 1409 during the second peak period, and 1571 during the third peak period. The study's inclusion criteria were determined to be between the ages of 18 and 65, not to have a major psychiatric illness, to have worked in a COVID-19-related unit for at least 15 days, to have experienced a pandemic peak during the period of study, and to volunteer to participate. An online survey was used to invite participants to the study, and informed consent was obtained online. Only consented participants were able to access and fill in the scales. Re-participation through the online scale has been disabled. Scales that were filled in incomplete or out of instruction were excluded from the study. The study was conducted under the responsibility of Psychiatry Department of Kirikkale Yuksek Ihtisas Hospital. Local ethics committee ap-

the first and second peaks (10). The most likely explanation for this result is that the study's population was made up of healthcare workers who were at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because the fact

significant factor. It should also be accepted that they are the group most affected by this period (9, 25). When viewed in this light, it is possible that no negative mental state exists between the peaks in studies conducted in the general population or with students (19, 21-23, 26). Studies conducted with healthcare workers confirm the negative effect of peaks according to our article (9, 27). However, it is possible that pandemic-related mental symptoms such as insomnia and burnout of healthcare workers may cause an increase in anxiety and depressive symptoms (23). Furthermore, the fact that healthcare workers are more aware the consequences of the disease and are more likely to comply with measures such as isolation and restriction as they face the consequences may be a contributing factor to the current outcome (19). Although healthcare workers are aware of the importance of seeking psychological assistance and accessing mental health services, time constraints and difficult working conditions can prevent them from doing so (21). Although a vaccine for COVID-19 infection has been dis-

covered, it is not possible to say that it can cause a positive effect that can provide psychological relief to healthcare workers during our country's peak period. Traumatic events such as the demise of patients and colleagues experienced by healthcare workers during the pandemic may increase anxiety and depressive symptoms as a result of PTSD symptoms (28, 29). Staying away from activities that positively affect mental health, such as not being able to engage in social activities and not being able to do physical activities such as sports and walking, may have an effect on the increase in anxiety and depression when compared to non-health workers (28). Finally, SARS CoV-2 mutations and their effects, which emerge as a result of close monitoring of scientific developments, can have a negative impact on healthcare workers (28, 29). Given all of this information, the increase in symptoms of healthcare workers during the pandemic should be regarded as expected.
Another significant finding of our study is that stress symptoms in healthcare workers did not increase in the third peak when compared to the second peak (22). The most likely explanation for this result is that healthcare workers' mental resilience began to improve, and they began to develop coping mechanisms. On the other hand, increasing vaccination applications and developing policies to support them might be perceived as a sign of hope and reduce the mental strain on healthcare workers (26, 30). Individuals may feel less helpless if they believe the pandemic will end (31). The relaxed restriction practices may also have provided some relief to individuals (1). The long duration of the pandemic may have increased people's ability to find and use self-sufficiency behaviors to manage their stress (32). Previous research has found a link between self-sufficiency and stress and anxiety levels, and that self-sufficiency may be protective against depression (33, 34).
Another finding from our study was that, even after the vaccination campaign was launched to provide social immunity throughout the country and public awareness of the infection increased, COVID-19 test positivity in healthcare workers continued to rise. It is worth noting that these results are significantly higher when compared to the general population. It is certain that this disease, as well as the risk of transmitting a disease to their relatives, has a negative impact on the mental health of healthcare workers (29).
It is well known that during the pandemic duration, the economic situation deteriorates, job opportunities become scarce, income inequality increases and purchasing power declines. (10) However, previous research has shown that people with low incomes and who are economically disadvantaged are at a higher risk of developing depression symptoms (19). In our study, as in the literature, the economic situation deteriorated compared to previous peak periods, and so did the income-expenditure balance. Although our country's health sector has more job opportunities than other sectors, it was thought that the reason for this economic deterioration, which we determined in our study, could be financial difficulties experienced by individuals working in other sectors in the family, in addition to the economic effects of the pandemic on countries (29).
We discovered that the number of people living with their families increased in the last wave of the pandemic compared to previous periods. The reason for this is that, in the early stages

837

Bratisl Med J 2022; 123 (11)
833 - 839
of the pandemic, healthcare workers did not want to stay in their own homes for fear of infecting their family members, but as the methods of infection protection were better understood during the pandemic, the uncertainty regarding the infection was slightly reduced, and the vaccine reached the family members of healthcare workers and the financial challenges of out-of-home accommodation made the workers thinking of going back home. However, as previously stated, the reason there is no significant relationship between the stress levels of healthcare workers between the last two peak periods can be attributed to the fact that returning to the home environment, which is a social interaction area, and providing family support increases the capacity to tolerate stress (35).
The results of this study can be evaluated within some limitations. The first is that psychometric measurements could not be taken in all three peaks of the study's same healthcare workers. Because of health policies, healthcare workers alternately work in COVID-19-related clinics. As a result, healthcare workers who worked in COVID-19-related units during peak periods were included in the study. A second limitation is that the participants' depression, anxiety, and stress levels during the pre-pandemic period are unknown, and the sample population does not represent the entire universe. Secondly, the fact that participants reported their current problems through online communication channels via self-report scales may have prevented the conduction of an objective evaluation. The last limitation is that the long-term consequences of the physical and mental symptoms of healthcare workers could not be evaluated prospectively due to the crosssectional design of the study.
Conclusion
Despite the information on the infection, vaccination studies, and public awareness studies, as a result of this research conducted on the mental health of healthcare workers working at the forefront in the fight against the pandemic, the reasons such as healthcare workers' workload, lack of equipment, uncertainties about when the pandemic will end, and burnout revealed that healthcare workers have experienced higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms in the third peak period compared to the second peak period. It is critical to provide psychological counseling to healthcare workers across the country, regulate working conditions, and arrange treatment as needed owing to this situation.
