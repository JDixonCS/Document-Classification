SUMMARY
Background: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) experience significantly higher prevalence of other mental disorders, which amplifies their need for overall support. The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) resulted in restrictions and limited access to different services with great challenge for families and children with ASD.
Subjects and methods: We used an electronic SurveyMonkey questionnaire to examine the experiences of 114 caregivers of FKLOGUHQ ZLWK $6' :H FRPSDUHG D OHYHO RI VXSSRUW E\ WKH FKLOG¶V VFKRRO FKDQJHV LQ FKLOG EHKDYLRU DQG SULRULW\ QHHGV IRU families of ASD and ASD with comorbidities (ASD+) children, during pandemic, and (b) developmental history and diagnosis for ASD and ASD+ children before the pandemic.
Results: Our research shows significant behavioral difficulties in the population with ASD and ASD+ that arose in the field of altered living conditions and overall functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistically significant results comparing ASD to ASD+ children we found in area of getting additional help and support before the outbreak of the pandemic (47.1% vs 16.0%, p=0.002), as well as in worsening of sleep problems, statistically significant more common in children with ASD+ (ASD+ 47.7% vs. ASD 25.7%, p=0.046).
Conclusions: Our findings can contribute to the faster development and implementation of protocols for dealing with situations such as pandemics, related to the vulnerable population of children with ASD and their caregivers.

INTRODUCTION
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social communication deficits, restricted interests, repetitive behaviors, and with an estimated global prevalence of 1% (APA 2013). It is a complex condition that significantly affects everyday life as well as the quality of life of the patient himself and that of his/her caregiver. Symptomatology that is often a presentation of comorbid state is very often misunderstood in everyday clinical practice as part of ASD clinical presentation. Individuals with ASD commonly experience significantly higher prevalence of other mental disorders compared to typically developed individuals (Romero et al. 2016). These comorbidities often exacerbate their need for overall support. It is generally considered that persons with comorbidity will have more severe impairments as a result of having more than one disorder (De Filippis 2018). It is estimated that nearly 70% of people diagnosed with ASD have at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder, and approximately 40% of them may have two or more

comorbid psychiatric disorders (Hossain et al. 2020). Common comorbidities in individuals with ASD are Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), mood alterations, sleeping and eating problems, mental retardation, behavioral problems, anxiety disorders, etc. (Lai et al. 2019). ASD continues to remain underdiagnosed in many countries (Elsabbagh et al. 2012). Serbia still does not have a national register of people with ASD8VLQJWKHVRFDOOHG³SURWHFWLYHGLDJQRVLV´LV common, avoiding the real, lifetime diagnosis of ASD. 0RUHRYHU ³JROG VWDQGDUG´ GLDJQRVWLF DVVHVVPHQW instruments, are rarely used, resulting in an inaccurate estimate of people diagnosed with ASD, which also includes the comorbid conditions (Lakic 2012, Stupar et al. 2015). The lack of exact diagnostic assessment hinders proper treatment, support, and total functioning improvement (Nik Adib et al. 2019). High functioning cases of ASD are often missed and they have been DVVHVVHGDV ³QRUPDOGHYHORSPHQW´IRUD ORQJSHULRGRI time (Elsabbagh et al. 2012). Therefore, it is logical to presume that individuals diagnosed with ASD are those with more severe and less functional forms of the

disorder. It can also be expected that their caregivers could have a higher level of stress and experience lack of social support (Elder et al. 2017).
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has resulted in drastic change of usual life style (Pfefferbaum & North 2020). The disease itself is characterized by a large spectrum of symptoms, high virulence and still an insufficiently predictable course (Chopra et al. 2021). The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many restrictions and limitations into everyday life, restrictions designed to protect the general population and prevent occurrence of the disease (Yuki et al. 2020). Pandemics are not unheard of in human history, however there is VWLOOOLWWOHH[SHULHQFHLQPDQDJLQJWKHSDQGHPLFV¶HIIHFWV on mental health and wellbeing (Guner 2020). COVID19 restrictions and limited access to different services have already been a great challenge for families with children and adults diagnosed with ASD.
Research on COVID-19 can inform the rapidly evolving knowledge base and identify strategies for developing resources to help families affected by ASD in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (Victor & Ahmed 2019, Colizzi et al. 2020). To this end, a primary step is to understand the needs of individuals affected by ASD as well as the needs of their caregivers.
The aim of this study was to compare: a) level of VXSSRUWE\WKHFKLOG¶VVFKRROFKDQJHVLQFKLOGEHhavior, and priority needs for families of children with ASD and ASD with comorbidities (ASD+) during pandemic, and b) developmental history and diagnosis for ASD and ASD+ children before the pandemic.
We want to engage knowledge in supporting diverse individuals and communities affected by neurodevelopmental disorders.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The Survey
Participants completed an electronic SurveyMonkey questionnaire developed by the Research Team from McGill University, Montreal, Canada. The survey was developed and pilot-tested with parents of children with neurodevelopmental conditions and was specifically designed to document the experiences of caregivers and/or parents of children (of all ages) with a neurodevelopmental condition before and during the pandemic. Survey questions were based on COVID-19 policy guidance recommendations for persons with disabilities and included topics such as response to the pandemic, access to care, and barriers and facilitators to keeping safe.
The questionnaire was translated from English to Serbian, independently by two researchers. The translations were then compared and combined. After this phase, back translation was performed by an independent consultant from the McGill University Research Team. The final Serbian questionnaire contained 149 of questions in 15 of sections and was designed to be completed in 20-30 minutes

(link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Za1DmF18g7MGr U2NtPfWh4VYcVAwq38G57r4aZ-ykNc/edit#responses).
Procedure
Caregivers of children with ASD were invited to participate in this study. The databases used to recruit participants belong to the child psychiatrist on the team as well as the parent association (NGOs) and specialized schools with whom we partnered. An email with the link to the survey was sent to parents and caregivers in the databases. The email included a brief explanation of the survey and its purpose. Participants were asked to forward the survey link to other caregivers of children diagnosed with ASD. Clicking the link automatically opened the survey. Data were collected from September to November 2020.
Participants
The survey was completed by 114 participants (parents and caregivers), 70 of which have children with an ASD only diagnosis, and 44 have children with ASD with some comorbid condition, disorder or disease (ASD+).
Statistical analysis
The data are presented in the form of arithmetic mean and standard deviation, i.e. in the form of absolute and relative numbers. The comparison of continuous values was performed by the t-test, and the comparison of categorical variables by the Chi-square test. We used a significance threshold of p<0.05. Statistical data processing was done in the software package R.
Ethics
The study procedures were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approvals of the Ethical Committee of the Clinical Center of Nis, Serbia and McGill University, Montreal, Canada. All participants were informed about the study and all provided informed consent via an online system.
RESULTS
The survey was completed by 114 participants. They were caregivers of 70 individuals with ASD diagnosis (ASD), and 44 with ASD and comorbidities (ASD+). Most participants were women (80.0% in the group with ASD and 84.1% in the group with ASD+), average age  \HDUV ELRORJLFDO SDUHQWV  RI $6' individuals 95.4% of ASD+). Over half indicated having completed higher education (69.0% ASD and 52.3% ASD+). Majority of the participants had full or part time work (72.8% with individuals with ASD and 65.9% ASD+). All examined characteristics were uniform between the groups. Demographic characteristics of the caregivers and children by diagnosis (ASD vs. ASD+) are presented in Table 1.

The following disorders were present in the group with ASD+: 21 children had intellectual developmental disorders (47.7%), 6 had anxiety disorders (13.6%), 15 epilepsy (34%), 6 allergies (13.6%), 3 vision/hearing problems (6.8%), 3 had problems with mobility (6.8%), 1 had chronic breathing problems (2.3%), 7 gastrointestinal disorders (15.9%), 9 sleep disorders (20.5%), 6 feeding and eating disorders (13.6%) (Figure 1).

The diagnosis of ASD was made between 1-3 years of age in 43.9% of children, between 4-8 years of age in 48.2% and between 9-12 years of age 6.1%. Two children (1.8%) with ASD + were diagnosed before the age of one. There was no significance between ASD and ASD + groups. The main reasons for caregivers to seek help of professionals was worsening of their child's symptoms, in 64.0% (68.6% in those with ASD, and in

From the moment when the caregivers sought the help of experts, until the diagnosis of ASD or ASD+, 1-3 months have passed for 20.2% children, 4-6 months for 11.4%, and 7-11 months for 7.0%. But, most often the diagnosis is made after one year (in 25.4%), or two or more years (25.4%), after initial contact with mental health professionals. There is no significant difference between the ASD and ASD+ groups.
Caregivers answered questions about the level of support before the pandemic, as well as the impact of the pandemic on the behavior and overall daily functioning of their children which is presented in Table 3.

We obtained data regarding services before pandemic outbreak and problems during the pandemic. To the question if the school / kindergarten that the child attended provided additional help/support services before pandemic, we obtained statistically significant results, comparing patients who have only ASD to ones with ASD+ children. Namely, school/kindergarten that the child attended provided more often additional help and support services to children diagnosed with ASD, before the outbreak of the pandemic compared to respondents with ASD+ (47.1% vs 16.0%, p=0.002) (Table 3).
During the pandemic, worsening of sleep problems was registered in 34.2% of the total sample, statistically significant more common in children with ASD+ (ASD+ 47.7% vs. ASD 25.7%, p=0.046) (Table 3). When it comes to changes in behavior and everyday life skills, as well as general functioning, there was no statistically significant difference between these two groups. However, we obtained clinically significant data that during the pandemic, there was worsening of problematic behavior present in 43.0% of the total population and uniformly between groups (42.9% and 43.2%, p=0.170). Everyday life skills deteriorated during the pandemic in 19.3% of the total sample and were equalized between groups (14.3% and 27.3%, respectively, p=0.172). Mental health deteriorated in 31.6% of the total sample and was uniform between groups (68.6% and 56.8%, respectively, p=0.355). The other important area of overall functioning is worsening of repetitive behavior, and it was observed in 39.5% of the total sample, i.e. in 45.7% of ASD and 29.5% of ASD+ during pandemic (p=0.101). Also, we observed worsening of social interaction in 22.8% of the total population which was equalized between groups (27.1% and 15.9%, respectively, p=0.265). Deterioration in communication was observed in 27.2% of the total sample, i.e. 27.1% ASD and 27.3% ASD+ (p=0.922). Sensory problems worsened in 22.8% of the total population, respectively 20.0% ASD and 27.3% ASD+ (p=0.281). Worsening of education problems was observed in 31.6% of the total population, i.e. 30% of ASD and 34.1% of ASD (p=0.899). During the pandemic, health

problems remained unchanged in 93.9% of the total sample, i.e. in 97.1% of ASD and 88.6% of ASD+ (p=0.179). There were no significant changes in feeding problems and issue of insecurity during the pandemic compared to the previous period.
When asked about caregiver's top three priorities for families whose child is affected by some developmental disorder in Serbia, they most often stressed the need to improve mental health services (65.8%), relatively evenly among ASD and ASD+ groups (Table 4). Second in line is better protection of human rights of persons with special needs, 61.4% (ASD 52.9%, ASD+ 75.0%). In third place is the improvement of the education system (59.6%), without significant differences by groups. Other needs highlighted by parents as very important for people with ASD in Serbia are: service development (43.9%), finance (56.1%), greater community awareness (36.8%), and more information relevant to the child's condition (36.0%) and improvement of health services in the field of physical health (27.2%).
DISCUSSION
When it comes to comorbidities, our results differ from the data available in literature where ADHD presents the most common comorbidity of ASD. Our results show the absence of ADHD as a comorbidity, which can be interpreted as a cultural influence on the diagnosis of ADHD (Taylor & Timimi 2004, Mazzone & Vitiello 2016). In Serbia, diagnosis of both disorders DOVRLVQRWEDVHGRQ³JROGVWDQGDUGV´7KHUHVXOWVVKRZ that ASD is diagnosed after the age of four in more than 52% of cases. The explanation can be found in the fact that ASD in clinical practice is replaced with the GLDJQRVLV 'LVKDUPRQLF GHYHORSPHQW´ ;aviera et al. 2015), most often in order to prevent stigmatization (Pejovic-Milovancevic et al. 2018). Among pediatricians, general psychiatrists and psychologist the prevailing tendency is to wait until the child is 36 months old. Underdiagnosing of ASD is also present in developed countries (Lai et al. 2019, Elsabbagh et al. 2012). On the other hand, ADHD is often recognized DV D ³QRUPDO GHYHORSPHQW´ DQG ZLWKLQ $6' $'+'

DISORDERS COMORBIDITY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN SERBIA

Psychiatria Danubina, 2022; Vol. 34, No. 3, pp 587-594

appears to be difficult to recognize as a comorbid diagnosis. It can also be seen that the wait for an ASD diagnosis is also long (in 48.8% of cases it lasted longer than a year).
The presumption of our study was that altered living conditions and daily functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic could have a particular impact on the ASD and ADS+ populations. Pandemic conditions certainly disrupt daily routines, and an important part of the clinical presentation of ASD is hypersensitivity and poor response to change (Umucu & Lee 2020).
The results of our study show that in both groups, ASD and ASD+, there was a worsening of both autism symptoms and general behavioral problems. This result is consistent with the findings of other researchers who have dealt with behavioral changes in children with ASD during altered pandemic conditions, even with very similar results (Patel et al. 2020).
Our results also reveal that in both groups there was deterioration in repetitive behavior patterns (as much as 39.5%), acquired skills of daily self-care, social interaction and sensory problems, with additional difficulties in education. A natural course of social communication problems and sensory problems in people with ASD, has either improvement, or the condition has remained unchanged over the years (Hasen et al. 2014, Mazurek et al. 2012). Our findings of deterioration could represents a significant change and confirms the potential negative impact of the emerging pandemic conditions on this population. Also, our findings are consistent with a similar study, during the COVID-19 pandemic, where it was found that in their examined population of parents of children with ASD there was a worsening of problematic behavior patterns, problems with aggression, self-harm and sensory problems (Mutluer et al. 2020). In addition, participating caregivers report deterioration in social communication, increased stereotypes, sensory hypersensitivity and aggression during the COVID-19 pandemic (Mutluer et al. 2020). Research on this topic by other authors also reveals much more intense (in 35.5% of respondents) and much more frequent (in 41.5% of respondents) behavioral problems in the population with ASD whose parents participated in this study, compared to the period before the pandemic (Colizzi et al. 2020). Lifestyle changes during a pandemic can also be classified as a potentially traumatic experience, especially given that individual reactions of people with ASD to altered pandemic conditions are similar to symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Peterson et al. 2019). This view is based on the study of specific symptoms of PTSD in people with ASD (aggressive behavior, self-harm, sleep and concentration problems, common in people with ASD after trauma) (Storch et al. 2013). It can be observed that the main finding of PTSD symptoms in children with ASD, namely,

increased behavioral problems, aggressive behavior, irritability, increased stereotypes, worsening of social communication, as well as problems with feeding and sleeping, are all symptoms that overlap with obtained in behavioral changes in children with ASD during the COVID-19 pandemic, as supported by the findings of our research. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind that the current, prolonged pandemic situation can cause such symptoms, and professionals who deal with the mental health of this population should notice the appearance of these symptoms on time, or their worsening, for a prompt therapeutic response (Narzisi 2020).
The results show that the worsening of ASD symptoms and behavioral problems has occurred during the pandemic, however, the difference between the groups was not significant. This may indicate that the primary disorder (ASD) presents a major risk for symptom exacerbation of this vulnerable group rather than its comorbidities. Namely, prolonged time of confinement in the house and changes in daily routines with insufficient understanding of the resulting changes can affect these deteriorations. However, perhaps the factor that has the greatest impact on such worsening of symptoms and overall functioning is the lack of previous help from experts dealing with this population and changes in the school system (online teaching, termination of schooling and direct participation in previous school routines, which also affects the structure of daily functioning 2¶6XOOLYDQ HW DO  :H EHOLHYH WKDW WKLV IDFWRU should be especially considered in relation to planning future support for this population in the changed general conditions of functioning. Namely, the results we obtained show that sufficient education provided by school or another institution had only 9.6% of respondents, which is a significantly smaller number than before the pandemic. As many as 67.5% had no education provided at all, which may be a significant additional factor in the general deterioration of the functioning of this population.
Challenges that parents face in getting support for their child during the pandemic, are related to getting adequate social assistance/support for the child, lack of school education and the protection of fundamental rights. Caregivers of children with ASD+ are significantly more committed to the protection of the human rights of individuals with special needs, compared to those with ASD children only. This is expected, given that the needs of their children are objectively greater. In 65.8% of cases, both groups of caregivers are in favor of improving health services in the field of mental health, in contrast to the needs of improving health services in the field of physical health, for which 27.2% of caregivers are in favor.
The overall satisfaction with the received support during a pandemic is estimated as low. Most basic factors contributing to the parental dissatisfaction are: FKLOG¶V EHKDYLRUDO SUREOHPV ODFN RI VRFLDO VXSSRUW DQG lack of adequate health and educational services.

DISORDERS COMORBIDITY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN SERBIA

CONCLUSIONS
Our research shows significant behavioral difficulties in the population with ASD and ASD + that arose in the field of altered living conditions and overall functioning during the COVID 19 pandemic. Understanding its impact on this population is crucial for planning psychosocial and therapeutic interventions, as well as those related to the education of these individuals, and educational treatments related to everyday life skills (Peterson et al. 2019).
By identifying all aspects of this problem, we can contribute to the faster development and implementation of protocols for dealing with situations such as pandemics, related to the vulnerable population of children with ASD and their caregivers. Therefore, such research is positioned as a priority in order to see global needs and barriers and develop strategies to address the problems of the ASD population and their caregivers in changed and more complex living conditions.
Limitations of study are that the questionnaire was distributed exclusively through electronic communications and social networks. Therefore, the questionnaires were filled out on a voluntary basis only by those who wanted and who are otherwise users of these networks. It is possible that the findings of this study might be more prominent in the excluded group of families. Also, self-report measures may lead to different response biases or memory recall, which impedes generalization of our findings.
