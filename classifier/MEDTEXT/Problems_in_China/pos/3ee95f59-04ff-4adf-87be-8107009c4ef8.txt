Abstract
Background
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic rapidly occurred in Shanghai, China at the end of February 2022, which was not only attacking physical health, such as sleep problems, but also exacerbating mental health. This study aimed to determine the association between sleep quality and psychological distress in COVID-19 carriers in China and evaluate the moderating effects of perceived social support.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1283 asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers from Ruijin Jiahe Fangcang shelter hospitals in Shanghai, China. Participants had an average age of 39.64 years (SD= 11.14) and 59.6% of whom were male. They were assessed using the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) respectively. The Model Templates for PROCESS were used to examine the moderating effects of participants' social support on the association.
Results
In total, 34.3% of participants presented with poor sleep quality (PSQI5); In addition, 41.1% patients showed bad mental health (GHQ3). Sleep quality was positively related to mental health (r=0.30, p< 0.001) and social support (r=0.08, p=0.003). Social support was negatively related to mental health (r = -0.43, p<0.001). Social support negatively moderated the association between sleep quality and mental health (=0.069, p<0.01).
Conclusions
Social support may be beneficial to the improvement of mental health, especially for people in crisis (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic).
1. Introduction
As of May 17th, over 522 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 pandemic have been reported globally. If we deeply dive into the number, the pooled percentage of asymptomatic infections was 0.25% among the tested population and 40.50% among the population confirmed with COVID-19.1 Asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers refer to patients with no symptoms at screening point, which includes pre-symptomatic infections (infected people who have not developed symptoms yet, but go on to develop symptoms later), and true
Page 2/16

asymptomatic or covert infections (those who are infected but never develop any symptoms). 2-3 To control the spread of infection, asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers were collected in the Fangcang shelter hospitals in China. Previous studies showed that admission period had negative effects on physical inactive, sleep quality and eating disorders4-5and 24% of participants reported deterioration in sleep quality.6 These negative changes varied from occupations, healthcare workers reported the highest rate of poor sleep quality.7 Apart from sleep problems, the uncertainty and isolation of COVID-19 pandemic also brought about mental health issues, including anxiety, stress and depression.5 A study investigated patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 in China, approximately 20.9% and 18.6% of them had anxiety and depression respectively.8 Furthermore, the risk factors of mental health include sex, age, education, occupation, sleep quality mainly in quarantined population.9-10 Therein, sleep quality is a critical contributing factor, in other words, better sleep quality decreases incidence of mental problems, which has been validated in university students,11 the elderly 12 and COVID-19 patients.13
Perceived social support refers to the emotional experience and satisfaction that individuals feel respected, supported, and understood from the society. It might be used to interpret the mechanism of psychological or mental health problems.14 Low levels of social support and sleep quality could lead to mental problems in college students and the elderly.15-16 Previous research has repeatedly emphasized the role of social support in the promotion of mental health.17 Although a substantial number of research found this strong relation can hold across a broad range of samples, such as the disabled, healthcare workers, patients with chronic kidney failure and so on,18-21 a handful of studies have presented different results. A meta-analysis has concluded that for the aged people, mental health was weakly or extremely weakly associated with social support.22 Likewise, it has been claimed that the social support is only related to mental health in females only, not in males.23
This study included social support as a potential intervention factor and sleep quality as a trigger factor to construct a moderation model that examines the underlying mechanism of mental health among asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers (see Fig. 1). Based on previous research, the following hypothesis were proposed: (1) Among asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers, sleep quality will be significantly associated with mental health. (2) Social support has a moderating role in the relationship between sleep quality and mental health.

2. Methods
2.1. Participants
All subjects were enrolled from the Ruijin Jiahe Fangcang shelter hospital, Shanghai from March to April, 2022. COVID-19 was detected by nucleic acid method using a nasopharynx swab. The criterion for a negative result was two consecutive negative results in the patient's nucleic acid tests at an interval of at
Page 3/16

least 24hrs. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) 18-69 years; (2) Positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test results in respiratory specimens and diagnosed as asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers; and (3) A willing to be studied and the ability to use a smartphone. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) A serious mental illness or a combination of severe disorders that could affect anxiety or depression (such as acute coronary syndromes, acute pulmonary embolism, malignant tumors, immune system disease, acute gastrointestinal bleeding and immunosuppressive drugs, such as hormones, taken within the previous 3 months), (2) Women who were breastfeeding or pregnant, or (3) Those who refused to be included or who were the subjects with an investigator's uncertainty about their ability to comply with the protocol requirements. The self-designed questionnaires in Chinese language were distributed through an online survey platform "Questionnaire Star", and the information was collected via WeChat. Demographics for the final sample (n=1283) are presented in Table 1.

2.2.1. Sleep quality

Sleep quality was measured using the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).24 The PSQI is a self-reported questionnaire that contains 19 items and 7 sleep components: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of the component scores yields the total scores, which ranges from 0 to 21 points. Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality. The cut-off value to differentiate between good and poor sleepers is >5 points.
2.2.2. Mental health

Mental health was evaluated using the 12-item version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).25- 26 The GHQ-12 is a self-reported questionnaire evaluating an individual's psychological distress during the past two weeks. The 0-0-1-1 rating used in the questionnaire means that the first two items selected by the subjects are scored as 0, and the last two items selected are scored as 1, total scores are from 0 to 12; higher scores suggest greater mental health impairment. The cut-off for mental health is 3 points, with scores of >3 suggesting bad mental health. The internal consistency reliability of the GHQ-12 in the present study was 0.83.
2.2.3. Social support

Social support was measured using by the Perceived social support scale (PSSS). The PSSS is a 12-item self-reported measure of perceived social support from three sources: family, friends and significant others. Respondents were asked to report their agreement with items on a 7-point Likert scale.27 Total scores of the PSSS are from 12 to 84, with higher scores indicating higher perceived social support. The PSSS features good psychometric properties.28 In the present study, the internal consistency reliability of the perceived social support was 0.98.

2.3. Date analysis
All the date was analyzed by SPSS 28.0 software. Preliminary analyses consisted of testing group differences among the distribution of demographic characteristics, mental health and sleep quality, using t-tests and chi-square tests (see Table 1). Spearman's correlation was used to test the associations between sleep quality, psychological distress and social support. The PROCESS v4.1 macro (Model 1)29 was used for moderation analysis to test the indirect of social support. When the 95% confidence interval of the indirect effect (a * b path) does not contain zero, the indirect effect is considered significant.30 The statistical significance of interaction items was defined as a two-tailed P<0.05, which was regarded as having moderating effects in the moderation model. The study variables were standardized.

3. Results
3.1. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis

Table 1 provides the demographic characteristics and the distribution of mental health and sleep quality. Comparing the means using an independent t-test and ANOVA, it was found that female presented worse sleep quality (t = -3.52, p=0.000). Over follow-up, the median duration for nucleic acid test result to turn negative was 12.64 days. 34.3% of patients presented with poor sleep quality (PSQI5); In addition, 41.1% of patients showed bad mental health (GHQ3).Table 2 provides the variables' means, SD, and correlations. Sleep quality was positively related to mental health (r=0.30, p<0.001) and social support (r=0.08, p=0.003). Social support was negatively related to mental health (r = -0.43, p<0.001).

4. Discussion

Page 9/16

4.1. Main findings
We examined the potential mechanism underlying the link between sleep quality and mental health in a large sample of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers collected in the Fangcang shelter hospitals. The results indicate that social support has a moderating effect on the relationship between sleep quality and mental health. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that clarifies the underlying moderation mechanism linking sleep quality to mental health in asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers in China.
The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that nearly 41.10% of the sampled asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers were found to be prone to bad mental health, which was lower than the ratio of psychological problems in other studies.31 For example, an observational, cross-sectional study of 129 patients with mild to moderate illness from Jiangxia Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan, China found that 49.6% of participants had depressive or anxiety symptoms.32A systematic review and meta-analysis on psychological and mental impact of COVID-19 among healthcare workers, the general population, and patients with higher COVID-19 risk published between 1 November 2019 to 25 May 2020. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was the highest among patients with pre-existing conditions and COVID-19 infection (56% [39%-73%] and 55% [48%-62%]).33 This finding was most likely because this study was a survey conducted in Shanghai after the third year of COVID-19 breakout, while other studies started several months or even a year after the COVID-19 occurred. And differences of results may be due to differences from different scales of psychological problems. In addition, asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers mostly have no relevant clinical symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore throat and other self-perceived or clinically recognized symptoms and son on, which could reduce people's mental stress.
In this study, results indicated that poor sleep quality was a risk factor for mental health for asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers in Fangcang shelter hospitals. A substantial body of literature has shown that stressful life events and outbreaks of infectious diseases, including COVID-19, can affect sleep quality,34-37and 34.3% of the participants suffered from poor sleep quality, which was higher than general population before the outbreak of COVID-19, the pooled prevalence of insomnia in general population was 15.0% in China according to a meta-analysis in 2017.38There is a large amount of data on the effects of sleep quality on mental health in other populations, such as healthcare workers,39 patients recovered from COVID-19, 40frontline nurses.41In addition, the present study demonstrated that patients who perceived lower social support were vulnerable to mental health. This supports prior findings documenting the importance of social support when managing enduring stressors that cannot be quickly and individually worked out.42Social support functions as a buffer for poor sleep quality and bad mental health. For example, those with poor sleep quality following COVID-19 may fail in recuperation and rejuvenation of the brain, which then leads to increased anxiety and depressive mood. Surprisingly, the moderating effect of perceived social support could provide help for patients in response to difficulties.
4.2. Strengths and limitations
Page 10/16

This study has several limitations worth noting. First, this was a cross-sectional study and a causal relationship between sleep quality and psychological distress could not be established. Second, this study adopted a self-rated questionnaire, we cannot exclude the possibility of response bias. In the future research, biological indicator or clinical diagnosis of sleep quality may be used to do evaluation objectively. Third, we could not adjust for other factors that could affect sleep quality and mental health, such as environment, comorbidities, which is good for improving sleep quality and promoting mental health.
Despite these limitations, we believe that our results are valuable as they included a major sample of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers admitted in Fangcang shelter hospitals in China. It is also meaningful to help inform future public health intervention of the value of quality of sleep in preventing and addressing mental health problems.
5. Conclusion
The study demonstrated that the significant impact of sleep quality on the mental health on asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers admitted in Fangcang shelter hospitals. Perceived social support was the protective factor of mental health problems. Hence, it is important for hospitals and health care institutions to provide psychosocial support and intervention for asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers to avoid further impact of the epidemic.
