PURPOSE. We reported previously that aquaporin 0 (AQP0) modulates lens fiber cell gap junction (GJ) channel function. The present study was conducted to find out whether the Cterminal end of AQP0 is involved in this regulation.
METHODS. A mouse model, AQP0DC/DC, was genetically engineered to express AQP0 with 1246 amino acids, without the normal intact AQP0 (1-263 amino acids) in the lens. Transparency and focusing of the lens were assessed. Intracellular impedance was measured to determine GJ coupling resistance. Intracellular hydrostatic pressure (HP) was also determined. Western blotting was performed to determine connexin (Cx46 and Cx50) expression levels.
RESULTS. At postnatal day 10, AQP0DC/DC mouse lenses relative to age-matched wild-type lenses showed loss of transparency and abnormal optical distortion; GJ coupling resistance increased in the differentiating (1.6-fold) and mature (8-fold) fiber cells; lens HP increased approximately 1.5-fold at the junction between the differentiating and mature fiber cells and approximately 2.0-fold in the center; there was no significant change (P > 0.05) in expression levels of Cx46 or Cx50.
CONCLUSIONS. The increase in GJ coupling resistance was not associated with reduced connexin expression, suggesting either a reduction in the open probability or some physical change in plaque location. The increase in resistance was significantly greater than the increase in HP, suggesting less pressure-driven water flow through each open GJ channel. These changes may lead to a loss of transparency and abnormal optical distortion. Overall, our data demonstrate the C-terminal end of AQP0 is involved in modulating GJ coupling to maintain lens transparency and homeostasis.

that The

lens has a single layer of cuboidal anterior epithelial cells with

actively proliferating equatorial cells. Proliferating equatorial

cells give rise to secondary fiber cells that elongate to form the

bulk of the lens. Older fiber cells are internalized as new layers

are added over older cells.

During the differentiation of the fiber cells, aquaporin 0

(AQP0), a membrane water channel protein containing 263

amino acids, begins to express at the outer cortex. As the fiber

cells elongate and mature, they eliminate cellular organelles as these structures would scatter light.1 AQP0 undergoes gradual

loss of N- and C-terminal ends as a posttranslational modification and as part of fiber cell remodeling.2,3 These

alterations reduce light scattering and aid the central fiber

cells to survive throughout life. AQP0 is a low-permeability water channel4-9 and a cell-to-cell adhesion (CTCA) molecule.3,10-15 It is the predominant membrane protein (45%) in the fiber cells.16 The functions of AQP0 are critical for maintaining lens transparency,8,11,12,17 refractive index gradient,8,17,18 biomechanics,19 and homeostasis.4,7,8,11,12,17-19

crystallins.25,26 AQP0 and the above-mentioned interacting proteins undergo a gradual loss of N- and C-terminal ends. The C-terminal end-cleavage starts at the inner cortex; the amount of end-cleaved forms increases toward the outer nucleus, and the inner nucleus contains only the end-cleaved forms.2,18,27,28 End-cleavage has been speculated to be part of the aging process; however, N- and C-terminal end-cleavage occurs even in the lenses of 2-year-old humans27 and postnatal day 10 (P10) mice pups.17 These types of cleavages are accelerated at old age in human lenses.2,28
Connexin (Cx) transmembrane proteins form gap junction (GJ) channels between the fiber cells, allowing small molecules such as ions (Naþ and Ca2þ), cellular metabolites, and second messengers to move between cells.29-38 Epithelial cells express Cx43 and Cx50, whereas fiber cells express Cx46 and Cx50.39 AQP water channels are present in epithelial and fiber cells.40-43 AQP1 and AQP5 are expressed in the epithelial cells, and AQP0 and AQP5 in the fiber cells. All play important roles in the lens microcirculation and homeostasis. Alterations or loss of AQP0, Cx46, or CX50 lead to loss of homeostasis and lens opacities.43-46 Several mutations in AQP0 or GJ proteins are responsible for congenital cataracts.44,45

tates ion and nutrient to enter and metabolic waste to exit the lens; AQPs, GJs and ion channels (transporters, cotransporters, and exchangers) are involved in creating and maintaining the microcirculation.38,46-48 The lens microcirculation model proposed by Mathias et al.38,46 suggests that sodium ions enter at the anterior and posterior poles and move through the extracellular space toward the center of the lens. Extracellular sodium moves toward the center of the lens because the sodium ions are continuously leaving the extracellular compartment as they enter fiber cells down their transmembrane electrochemical potential. In the intracellular compartment, a center-to-surface electrochemical gradient develops to drive sodium ions through GJs toward the equatorial surface where they are transported out by the epithelial Naþ-Kþ-ATPases (for Naþ) or Naþ/Ca2þ exchanger and Ca2þ-ATPase (for Ca2þ). Osmosis drives water flow to follow the sodium flow and enter fiber cells across their cell membranes. In the intracellular compartment, salt and water both flow through GJs, so osmosis is not possible; instead, a center-to-surface hydrostatic pressure (HP) gradient develops to drive water flow through GJs to the lens surface. At the lens surface, the fluid follows the sodium and leaves the lens due to transmembrane osmosis. In this microcirculation, the inward fluid flow carries nutrients and antioxidants to central fiber cells, while the outward fluid flow carries waste products from central fibers to surface epithelial cells. GJs are involved in the outflow of the lens microcirculatory system.39 Measurement of the intracellular HP gradient provides information on the number of open GJ channels conducting the radial flow of both sodium and water and also indicates the functional state of the sodium circulation.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies showed that endcleaved AQP0 in the mature fiber cells regulates the spatial localization of GJs.49,50 Modulation of GJs by AQP0 has been reported by in vitro investigations.13,51 We demonstrated that AQP0, in the presence of lens beaded filament proteins, modulates GJ channel function24 and suggested that fiber cell- to-fiber cell adhesion by AQP0 could be a significant factor in the regulation of GJ function. To understand the role of the Cterminal end of AQP0 in the lens physiology, we developed a mouse model, AQP0DC/DC, that expresses only end-cleaved AQP0 in the fiber cells.17 Lenses of these mice developed cataracts by P15, so we studied lenses at P10 to see what physiological changes preceded the formation of cataracts and thus might be causal. GJ coupling resistance and HP were measured in age-matched wild-type (WT) and AQP0DC/DC lenses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
WT C57BL/6J (C57; Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and the C-terminal end-cleaved AQP0-expressing knockin mouse model17 AQP0DC/DC were used. Animal procedures were performed according to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research, the National Institutes of Health's (Bethesda, MD, USA) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and protocols approved by the Stony Brook University Animal Care and Use Committee.
WT and AQP0DC/DC were genotyped to confirm the absence of the natural mutation in CP49 gene, which was identified originally in mouse 129 strains.52 Genomic PCR was done using the primers and protocols as described previously.17,52 Development and characterization of the AQP0DC/DC mouse were described recently.17

Evaluation of Lens Transparency and Aberration
Lens transparency was assessed as described by Kumari et al.24 In short, P10 lenses of WT and AQP0DC/DC mice were dissected and placed into mammalian physiological saline (378C). Lens imaging of WT and AQP0DC/DC was done under the same lighting and imaging conditions, using a dark-field binocular microscope with a digital camera. Aberrations in the lens were qualitatively evaluated using dark-field optical grid focusing. Each lens was placed on a copper electron microscope specimen grid and imaged. Light scatter and aberrations were assessed by the quality of the grid lines focused by the lenses.

Lens GJ Coupling Measurement

Lenses were dissected from P10 WT and AQP0DC/DC pups and mounted as described by Gao et al.53 and Kumari et al.24 For

each impedance study, the lens was mounted in the perfusion

chamber that was attached to a microscope stage and perfused

with normal Tyrode's solution.

GJ coupling resistance (intracellular impedance) was

measured using microelectrodes filled with 3M KCl with initial resistances of 1.5 to 2 megaohms (MX).54 A microelectrode

was inserted into a central fiber cell, and a wide-band

stochastic current was injected. Another microelectrode was

inserted into a peripheral fiber cell at a distance r (cm) from

the center of a lens of radius a (cm) to record the induced

voltage. The frequency domain impedance (induced voltage ,

injected current) of the lens was recorded in real time using a

fast Fourier analyzer (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA). At

high frequencies, the magnitude of the lens impedance

asymptotes to the series resistance (Rs), which is the resistance

of all the GJs between the point of voltage recording and the

surface of the lens. Rs (kiloohms [KX]) was measured at multiple depths in lenses of WT and AQP0DC/DC mice; curve

fitting of the data with Equation 1 was done to determine the

underlying effective intracellular resistivities (RDF and RMF KX/

cm). These are directly proportional to the radial component

of GJ coupling resistance.

The cytoplasm forced into the microelectrode tip due to the positive intracellular

its resistance returned to the value measured outside of the

lens. A manometer was used to measure the pressure applied

to the microelectrode. Intracellular pressure was measured at

four to five depths for each lens. For each genotype, data from

at least eight lenses were pooled. By curve-fitting Equation 3 to

the pooled data, the average pressure gradient was estimated.

The quadratic r-dependence of pressure suggests the transmembrane entry of water into fiber cells is essentially uniform with depth into the lens.53 The change in the slope of the r-dependence at r ¼ b is thought to occur because the number of open GJ channels is different in the MF relative to
DF.

Western Blotting
Fiber cell membrane proteins of WT and AQP0DC/DC lenses were isolated by extraction with 4M-urea buffer (4 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0; 5 mM EDTA, 4M-urea). Western blotting was done as previously described.11,17 Antibodies to Cx46 and Cx50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) were used. Immunoreaction to an antibody was detected using an alkaline phosphatase kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA).

Statistical Analysis
Student's t-test was performed using a statistical software (SigmaPlot 10; Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). P values 0.05 were considered significant.

RESULTS
Lens Transparency and Focusing
We imaged WT and AQP0DC/DC mouse lenses at P10, under the dark field, to assess transparency. Compared to age-matched WT lenses, AQP0DC/DC lenses showed a reduction in transparency and changes in optical distortion (Fig. 1). No cataract was evident at P10 lenses of AQP0DC/DC mice. The electron microscopy grid pattern magnified by WT lenses produced a barrel deformation, called positive barrel distortion aberration, throughout. In this deformation, the straight lines curve inward

similar to the shape of a barrel. This curvature happens because there is a decrease in the magnification of the image as the object gets farther from the center (optical axis) of the lens. The grid-focusing pattern by the AQP0DC/DC lens showed an abnormal, much-distorted grid-line pattern and displayed two distinct zones. Zone I in the cortex showed a barrel distortion aberration as in the WT lenses, and zone II, at the lens nucleus, showed abnormal barrel distortion aberration compared with WT lens nucleus.
GJ Coupling in the Lenses of AQP0DC/DC Mice
Aquaporins and GJ channels in the fiber cells are important components of the lens microcirculation and homeostasis. Disruption of the lens microcirculation leads to loss of lens transparency and formation of cataract.8,35,39,55-57 To elucidate the mechanisms by which the presence of end-cleaved AQP0, in the absence of intact AQP0, causes loss of transparency, optical distortion, and cataracts (Fig. 1) and modulates GJ channel function,17 we investigated GJ coupling conductance and HP in lenses from the mouse model AQP0DC/DC.
In a previous study on age-related changes in C57 mouse lenses,47 GJ coupling conductance and HP were measured in 3to 5-day-old WT lenses. The MF coupling conductance was 27 Siemens per square centimeter (S/cm2) as compared to 5.2 S/ cm2 measured here in 10- to 13-day-old WT lenses. By 60 days of age, WT lens MF coupling has declined and pressure increased to a relatively stable value of about 0.8 S/cm2 and 350 mm Hg.47 There appears to be a rapid decline in coupling conductance during early development. If that decline is exponential, the time constant would be about 4 days. We were therefore careful to age match the WT and AQP0DC/DC mouse lenses as closely as possible at 10 to 13 days. As shown in Table 1, coupling conductance per area of cell-to-cell contact of DF decreased significantly to 0.91 S/cm2 (P < 0.005) compared to WT lenses (1.47 S/cm2). However, the coupling conductance (Gi) of MF decreased dramatically to 0.66 S/cm2 compared to that of WT (P < 0.0001), which was 5.2 S/cm2 (Table 1). These values were based on the best-fit curve (Equations 1 and 2) to RS data shown in Figure 2. The data were collected from seven to eight lenses of each genotype. Loss of 17 amino acids at the C-terminal end of AQP0 in AQP0DC/DC mice caused a significant decrease in radial coupling conductance (1.6-fold) in the DF and ~8-fold in the MF (Fig. 2; Table 1).
HP in the Lenses of AQP0DC/DC Mice
The data on the radial distribution of intracellular pressure were fit with Equation 3 to determine the pressure at the lens surface (pi[a]) at the transition from differentiating fiber cells to mature fiber cells (pi[b]) and at the lens center (pi[0]; Fig. 3; Table 2). Both pi(0) and pi(b) increased in the AQP0DC/DC mouse lenses compared to WT, in line with the increased

coupling resistance. However, pi(b) and pi(0) increased by 1.5-fold (P <0 .01) and two-fold (P < 0.0001), respectively, compared to the WT. The latter was significantly less than the increase in MF coupling resistance, which was about eightfold.
In a previous study,47 HP at the center of 3- to 5-day-old WT lenses was 62 mm Hg, so the increase in WT lens pressure between about 4 and 11 days of age was 1.6-fold, whereas the MF coupling conductance decreased from 27 S/cm2 to about 5.2 S/cm2, or ~5-fold. Thus, developmental changes in GJ coupling and pressure have a pattern similar to the changes in 11-day-old lenses due to the AQP0DC/DC mutated lenses relative to age-matched WT lenses. Both changes involve a large decrease in MF coupling conductance accompanied by a much more modest increase in central pressure. Could the Cterminal deletion have simply accelerated normal early developmental changes? We address this question in the Discussion section, but we suspect the answer is no, since the

mutation-induced changes lead to the rapid formation of cataracts by P15, whereas age-dependent developmental changes lead to transparent lenses that can be stable for the life of the animal.
Expression of Lens Fiber Cell Connexins in AQP0DC/DC Mice
To find out whether the decreased coupling conductance observed in the AQP0DC/DC lenses could be due to a decrease in GJ protein expression, we looked at the expression levels of the major lens connexins, Cx46 and Cx50. Immunoblotting of total lens membrane proteins of P10 pups of WT and AQP0DC/DC mice was performed (Fig. 4). Equal quantities of the membrane proteins were immunoblotted using Cx46 and Cx50 antibodies. Western blotting and protein quantification studies showed no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05) in the expression levels of Cx46 or Cx50 between WT and AQP0DC/DC lenses. Thus, the decreased GJ conductance and increased HP in AQP0DC/DC mouse lenses indicate that C-terminal end-cleaved AQP0 expression caused either

reorganization of GJs at the membrane or reduced the open probability of GJ channels.
DISCUSSION
We investigated GJ coupling and HP in lenses expressing only end-cleaved AQP0 in their fiber cells. In a normal lens, the outer cortex contains intact AQP0; the presence of end-cleaved AQP0 begins at the inner cortex and gradually increases toward the lens center (mouse44 and human2). Our data show a decrease in GJ coupling conductance and an increase in HP in AQP0DC/DC lenses relative to age-matched WT lenses. Our studies were conducted in lenses of recently born mice (P10), since the AQP0DC/DC lenses become cataractous by P15.
Newborn WT mouse lenses are undergoing rapid developmental changes.47 At birth, GJ coupling conductance is remarkably high but rapidly declines to the adult level (estimated time constant of about 4 days). The initial high level of coupling might occur to facilitate the movement of developmental signals, such as growth factors, throughout the lens. The process, however, appears to be self-limiting, as some signal induces rapid closure of GJ channels, particularly those of the MF. The expression of AQP0DC/DC instead of AQP0 appears to significantly disrupt the normal developmental program. Our data suggest the interaction of the C-terminus of AQP0 with GJs regulates coupling conductance, which appears to be one important aspect of the developmental program.
Ultrastructural studies have shown that loss of the Cterminal end of AQP0 correlates with the formation of large areas of thin junctions in WT lenses.14,58 GJ coupling measurements showed a significant reduction in coupling in the mature fiber cells relative to differentiating fiber cells in WT mice.29,31,32,34 Intracellular ion and water fluxes are both mediated by GJs,53 consistent with several studies on mutant or gene knockout mouse lenses that reported a decrease/ increase in GJ coupling,24,34,37 causing a commensurate increase/decrease in intracellular HP.24,34,37 In the AQP0DC/DC lenses, the reduction in radial GJ conductance could be due to the formation of large areas of thin junctions from the outer cortex to the nucleus by the end-cleaved AQP0 in the fiber cells. This may have altered the formation of GJs, as observed in the WT inner cortical and nuclear regions by AFM studies.49,59 This reduction in GJ coupling is likely to be the cause of increased HP.
Water permeability studies using AQP0DC/DC fiber cell membrane vesicles did not show any significant change;15 however, there was an increase in CTCA, possibly due to the formation of large areas of thin junctions since these lenses expressed end-cleaved AQP0 throughout.15 Normally, thin junction formation occurs at a higher level in the lens nucleus after the posttranslational N- and C-terminal cleavage of AQP0.49,58,59 The results presented here show that the loss of AQP0 C-terminus significantly reduces GJ coupling in both differentiating and mature fiber cells. The decrease in coupling conductance without a measurable change in connexin expression may be due to plaque reorganization in the fiber cells. However, the alternative hypothesis that there is a reduction in the open probability of GJ channels is not ruled out.
In AQP0DC/DC lenses, HP is not increased nearly as much as the coupling is reduced. This pattern is similar to changes in GJ coupling and HP during normal development. However, a normal 2-month-old lens has an MF coupling conductance of 0.8 S/cm2 and a central HP of 349 mm Hg,47 whereas the AQP0DC/DC lenses at 11 days of age have a MF coupling conductance of 0.7 S/cm2 and a central HP of 200 mm Hg. This

implies there is less pressure-driven water flow in the AQP0DC/DC lenses, so a loss of the C-terminus might cause developmental effects that reduce ion transport, leading to reduced fluid circulation in these lenses. This could be a contributing factor for the lenses developing opacities and distortion aberration (Fig. 1). However, the presence of normal AQP0 is also important for the structure of the lens, so structural distortions may contribute to opacities and distortion aberration in AQP0DC/DC lenses.
A recent investigation of AQP0þ/À lenses expressing only 50% of AQP0 in the fiber cell membrane showed an opposite effect, with an increase in GJ conductance and a decrease in HP.24 This could be due to the loss of 50% of AQP0 resulting in more surface area in the broad faces of fiber cell plasma membrane, enabling the formation of more functional GJ plaques. The presence of end-cleaved AQP0 and formation of thin junctions may be one important factor in the distribution of GJs and their radial coupling conductance.
In conclusion, GJs appear to play a critical role in early lens development. Data presented here suggest the spacial distribution of intact and C-terminal end-cleaved AQP0 from the cortex to the nucleus is critical for proper GJ channel development. Disruption of normal GJ developmental changes may cause the early onset of P15 cataracts seen in AQP0DC/DC lenses.
