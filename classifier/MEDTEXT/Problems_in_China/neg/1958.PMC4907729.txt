ABSTRACT Signals conveyed through the RAS-ERK pathway are essential for the determination of cell fate. It is well established that signal variability is achieved in the different microenvironments in which signals unfold. It is also known that signal duration is critical for decisions concerning cell commitment. However, it is unclear how RAS-ERK signals integrate time and space in order to elicit a given biological response. To investigate this, we used MCF-7 cells, in which EGF-induced transient ERK activation triggers proliferation, whereas sustained ERK activation in response to heregulin leads to adipocytic differentiation. We found that both proliferative and differentiating signals emanate exclusively from plasma membrane- disordered microdomains. Of interest, the EGF signal can be transformed into a differentiating stimulus by HRAS overexpression, which prolongs ERK activation, but only if HRAS localizes at disordered membrane. On the other hand, HRAS signals emanating from the Golgi complex induce apoptosis and can prevent heregulin-induced differentiation. Our results indicate that within the same cellular context, RAS can exert different, even antagonistic, effects, depending on its sublocalization. Thus cell destiny is defined by the ability of a stimulus to activate RAS at the appropriate sublocalization for an adequate period while avoiding switching on opposing RAS signals.

INTRODUCTION Signals conveyed through the RAS-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) axis (RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase [MEK]-ERK) play critical roles in multiple cellular functions, including cell fate decisions at the proliferation/differentiation/apoptosis crossroads. A large body of data shows that the RAS-ERK pathway operates in the determination of cell destiny by mechanisms that extend beyond its simple on-off status and that subtle variations in

several signal parameters can evoke profound alterations in its biological output (Kholodenko et al., 2010). For example, in mammary epithelial cells, the decision to proliferate depends on ERK's signal amplitude and frequency (Albeck et al., 2013). Signal duration is also critical in the determination of cell commitment. This was initially demonstrated in rat pheochromocytoma PC-12 cells, in which transient ERK activation, stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF), resulted in proliferation, whereas sustained ERK activation, evoked by nerve growth factor (NGF), induced cell differentiation (Traverse et al., 1992). This phenomenon has been observed in multiple cellular models, such as squamous cell lung carcinoma SCC12F cells (McCawley et al., 1999) and Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, in which transient ERK activation resulting from EGF treatment induced proliferation, whereas prolonged ERK activation triggered by HGF led to the acquisition of mesenchymal features, including scattering (Liang and Chen, 2001).
In addition, a wealth of data has led to the abandonment of the view that the RAS-ERK pathway is a unique, linear signaling axis. It is now established that space plays a critical role in the RAS-ERK pathway by providing variability to its signals, depending on the availability of regulatory and effector molecules at the different

tion that exhibits similar kinetics at the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Similarly, disordered membrane platforms are competent for inducing apoptosis. We show that overexpression of HRAS and other constituents of the RAS-ERK pathway leads to the prolongation of EGF-induced ERK activation and that this is sufficient to transform the EGF signal into a differentiating stimulus. Of interest, EGF evokes differentiation only if the overexpressed RAS localizes at disordered membrane microdomains but not at other sublocalizations. However, from the Golgi complex, RAS can induce apoptosis and antagonize differentiation signals. Our results demonstrate that specific spatial and temporal cues are critical for biological output determination as mediated by RAS-ERK signaling.

Overexpression of HRAS transforms EGF signal into a differentiation stimulus The foregoing results indicated that signal kinetics rather than signal localization marked the difference between RAS-ERK- induced proliferative and differentiating outputs. Thus we tested whether by altering signal duration we could transform the EGF-induced proliferative signal into a stimulus evoking differentiation. For this purpose, we overexpressed several members of the RAS-ERK pathway in MCF-7 cells. This resulted in significant prolongation of ERK activation in response to EGF treatment (Figure 7, A and B). Whereas EGF was incapable of inducing differentiation by itself, EGF treatment in cells overexpressing either MEK1 or HRAS evoked significant levels of adipocytic differentiation. To ascertain that HRAS was promoting differentiation via the ERK pathway, we used the HRAS T35S mutant, which signals specifically through such an effector route (Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1997). In agreement, this mutant also elicited significant levels of adipocytic differentiation upon EGF stimulation (Figure 8).
It was of interest to determine whether the nature of EGF signal could be altered by HRAS, depending on its sublocalization. To this end, we used the aforementioned sitespecific HRAS constructs. Of interest, only overexpression of DM-tethered CD8-HRAS led to prolongation of ERK activation in response to EGF; overexpression of either GC KDELr-HRAS or ER-targeted PTP-HRAS was ineffective in this respect (Figure 7, A and B). In agreement, whereas overexpression of CD8-HRAS efficiently facilitated

there (Sanz-Moreno et al., 2003) by preventing its interaction with phosphatases (Casar et al., 2012). To sustain ERK signaling at the cytoplasm, we transfected cells with PEA15, a protein that serves as a cytoplasmic anchor for ERK, preventing its nuclear translocation (Formstecher et al., 2001). Because binding to PEA15 can affect ERK activity in some instances (Mace et al., 2013), we also prolonged ERK cytoplasmic activity by down-regulating the expression of the cytoplasmic phosphatase DUSP-6 using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs; Caunt and Keyse, 2013). Indeed, the presence of MXI2 sustained EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation exclusively at the nucleus, whereas PEA15 overexpression or knockdown of DUSP-6 acted similarly at the cytoplasm (Figure 9A). However, none of these processes was capable of promoting adipocytic differentiation of MCF-7 cells in the presence of EGF (Figure 9B). These results demonstrated that prolonging ERK activation exclusively at the nucleus or at the cytoplasm is not sufficient to trigger differentiation in response to EGF stimulation.

fact that oncogenic RAS induces a potent apoptotic response in MCF-7 cells could help to explain why RAS mutations are so rare in mammary tumors.
Thus our results suggest that because signals evoking different, even antagonistic, outcomes can originate from the same sublocalization, in the case of mammary epithelial cells, the determination of cell fate by RAS-ERK signals would be primarily dictated, not by spatial considerations, but by the duration of the RAS signal: a transient

signal evokes proliferation, a prolonged one leads to differentiation, and a constant signal causes cell death. However, we found that apoptosis can also be potently induced by oncogenic RAS from endomembranes like the GC. Along this line, a recent study showed that oncolytic viruses induce apoptosis by promoting RAS signals at such compartments (Garant et al., 2016). The RAS proapoptotic effect at the GC could explain why proliferative and differentiation stimuli, like those evoked by EGF and HRG, respectively, avoid

activating this RAS pool. In agreement, we showed that activation of endogenous RAS at the GC antagonizes differentiation as induced by HRG. Overall our results indicate that distinct spatiotemporally defined RAS signals can mediate antagonistic biological outputs. Thus, ultimately, cell destiny would be defined by the ability of a stimulus to activate RAS at the appropriate sublocalization for the adequate period of time while avoiding switching on opposing RAS signals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids Plasmids encoding HRAS wild type (wt), HRAS V12, and Lck-, M1-, KDELr-, CD8-tethered HRAS wild-type and N17 versions (Matallanas et al., 2006), MEK1 wt and Ha-MXI2 (Casar et al., 2007), and RASGRP1 (Arozarena et al., 2004) have been described previously. PTP-tethered HRAS (Lorentzen et al., 2010) was provided by P. Bastiaens (MPI, Dortmund). HRAS S35 was provided by J. Downward (Francis Crick Institute, London). KDELr-CDC25 was constructed following a strategy previously described (Matallanas et al., 2006) by fusing RasGRF1 Cdc25 domain C-terminal to KDELr N193D. shRNAs against DUSP6 were from Dharmacon.
Cell culture MCF-7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Stable cell lines were selected with 750 mg/ml G418 or 300 g/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). EGF, HRG, and U0126 were from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA. Adipocytic staining with Oil Red O and quantification by extraction with isopropanol were performed as described previously (Peregrin et al., 2006). Cell proliferation was analyzed basically as described (Rodriguez et al., 2010).
Antibodies Mouse monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) and rabbit polyclonals antiRhoGDI, anti-HRAS, anti-panRAS, anti-PEA15, anti-RSK1 anti-p-ERK,

and anti-ERK2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Rabbit polyclonal anti-p-RSK-1, anti-ELK1, and anti-p-ELK1 were from Cell Signaling, Billerica, MA. Rabbit polyclonal anti-caveolin and anti-lamin A were from BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA. Mouse monoclonal anti-transferrin receptor was from Zymed Laboratories, Waltham, MA. Rabbit polyclonal anti-calreticulin was from Calbiochem.
Immunoblotting Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters as described previously (Ajenjo et al., 2000). Immunocomplexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).
Time-lapse immunofluorescence Cells were grown on polylysine-coated, glass-bottom dishes and transiently cotransfected with Cherry-HRAS wt and GFP-RAF RBD E3-R3(A/D) (Augsten et al., 2006). Cells were deprived of serum, placed into a microscope chamber, and treated with EGF or HRG. Confocal images (512 × 512 pixels; 0.15-pixel size) were acquired at 37ºC in a TCS SP-5 confocal microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) with a 40×, 1.25 numerical aperture numerical aperture oil objective, a 1-Airy pinhole, and 200-Hz speed. Images were captured every 2 min for a period of at least 1 h after stimulation. Cells were excited with 458- and 543-nm laser lines. Images presented are after digital adjustment of brightness and contrast to maximize signal.
Nucleocytoplasmic fractionations Nucleocytoplasmic fractionations were performed exactly as described (Sanz-Moreno et al., 2003).
Plasma membrane fractionation in sucrose gradients Cells were collected and treated as described previously (Matallanas et al., 2006). Briefly, cells were resuspended in 25 mM

FIGURE 9: Effects of sustaining ERK phosphorylation at the cytoplasm and nucleus on differentiation. (A) Time course of ERK phosphorylation in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of cells transfected with MXI2, PEA15 (1 g), or shRNAs against DUSP6 and treated with EGF (50 ng/ml) for the indicated times. The purity of the fractions was ascertained by immunoblotting with lamin A and RhoGDI as nuclear and cytoplasmic markers, respectively. Left, evaluation of DUSP-6 down-regulation by shRNAs (sh). (B) Effects of the indicated constructs plus EGF treatment on differentiation. Bar chart shows the degree of differentiation quantified by extraction of the Oil Red O stain with isopropanol. Results show mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. ***p < 0.001 with 95% confidence interval.

Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.25% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitor cocktail (1 g/ ml). Lysates were set at a sucrose concentration of 45%. Layers of 3.4 ml of 35% sucrose and 1 ml of 16% sucrose were sequentially overlaid and centrifuged for 18 h at 41,000 rpm (MLS-50 rotor; Beckman, San Diego, CA). Twelve 0.4-ml fractions were collected and resuspended directly into SDS-PAGE sample buffer for analysis by immunoblotting.
Plasma membrane-endomembrane fractionation in sucrose gradients Cells from four 100-mm plates were collected and lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.3, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM KCl plus protease inhibitor cocktail, 1 g/ ml). Lysates were homogenized by passage through a 5-m/8.0-mm douncer and centrifuged (700 × g for 3 min at 4ºC).

The supernatant was subjected to a new centrifugation (40,000 × g for 30 min at 4ºC). The pellet containing the membranes was resuspended in homogenizing buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 25 mM KCl, 0.25% sucrose) and laid onto a discontinuous layer of iodixanol 2.5-30% to be centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 5-6 h at 4ºC.
Ras-GTP loading assays Ras-GTP loading assays were performed as described previously (Arozarena et al., 2000). H-Ras-GTP was affinity sequestered by using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-RAF-RBD. Immunoblots were performed with anti-HA antibody and quantified by densitometry using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Activation levels were related to total protein levels as determined by antiHA immunoblotting in the corresponding total lysates.
