Murine IgG3 anti-GD2 antibody m3F8 has shown anti-neuroblastoma activity in Phase I/II studies, where antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) played a key role. Humanization of m3F8 should circumvent human antimouse antibody (HAMA) response and enhance its ADCC properties to reduce dosing and pain side effect. Chimeric 3F8

In vitro comparison was made with m3F8 and other anti-GD2 antibodies in binding, cytotoxicity, and cross-reactivity assays. In GD2 binding studies by SPR, ch3F8 and hu3F8 maintained KD comparable to m3F8. Unlike other anti-GD2 antibodies, m3F8, ch3F8 and hu3F8 had substantially slower koff.. Similar to m3F8, both ch3F8 and hu3F8 inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro, while cross-reactivity with other gangliosides was comparable to that of m3F8. Both peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-ADCC and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN)-ADCC of ch3F8 and hu3F8Do not distribute. IgG1 were more potent than m3F8. This superiority was consistently observed in ADCC assays, irrespective of donors or NK-92MI-transfected human CD16 or CD32, whereas complement mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) was reduced. As expected, hu3F8-IgG4 had near absent PBMC-ADCC and CMC. Hu3F8 and m3F8 had similar tumor-to-non tumor ratios in biodistribution studies. Anti-tumor effect against neuroblastoma xenografts was better with hu3F8-IgG1 than m3F8. In conclusion, humanizing m3F8 produced next generation anti-GD2 antibodies with substantially more potent ADCC in vitro and anti-tumor activity in vivo. By leveraging ADCC over CMC, they may be clinically more effective, while minimizing pain and HAMA side effects. A Phase I trial using hu3F8-IgG1 is ongoing.

Introduction
Monoclonal antibody (MoAb) therapy is an accepted treatment modality for cancers, with five MoAb having received FDA approval for solid tumors in adults, including colorectal and breast cancer, non small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma.1,2 This modality, however, has remained inadequately exploited for the treatment of pediatric cancers. Unlike chemotherapy or radiation, MoAb is not myelosuppressive and genotoxic, generally with few long-term toxicities. These are critical considerations for young children. More importantly, MoAb is effective against metastatic cancer in blood, bone marrow and bone, typically found in high risk neuroblastoma (NB). As a class of agents, the pharmacokinetics and toxicities of human or humanized IgG1 antibodies have been extensively studied. In addition, antibodies can carry cytotoxic immune-based payloads, as well as radioisotopes, toxins or enzymes, thereby increasing the options for targeted therapy.

NB is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood. In ~50% of cases, curative strategies must tackle both soft tissue mass and metastases in the bone marrow (BM). Doseintensive chemotherapy improves tumor resectability and postsurgical irradiation reduces the risk of relapse in the primary site to , 10%.3 However, BM disease, as evidenced by histology or metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan, often persists and forebodes a lethal outcome.4,5 In addition, osteomedullary relapse is common, despite achieving near complete remission after induction therapy. Attempts at treatment intensification have met with acute and long-term side effects, both of grave concern for young patients. There is a scarcity of promising new agents, and to date, few if any target/pathway-specific small molecules have shown major clinical benefit in patients with NB, although many promising leads continue to accumulate.6 With a cure rate of , 30% at toxicity limits among Stage 4 patients diagnosed at $ 18 mo of age, there is substantial room for improvement.7

binding (kon, koff and KD) were compared by SPR using Biacore T-100. All engineered 3F8, including chimeric and humanized IgG1 and IgG4 had comparable koff as m3F8, and better KD than other anti-GD2 antibody such as 14.G2a (Fig. 1) and ME36.1 (Table 4). The slow koff of antibodies also translated into a slower wash-off when antibodies were reacted with GD2positive tumor cells LAN-1 or M14 and then washed multiple times in wash buffer. With each wash, the remaining antibodies on the cell surface were detected using a secondary FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody and mean fluorescent intensity determined by flow cytometry (data not shown).

Low cross-reactivity with other gangliosides. In crossreactivity studies, hu3F8-H1L1-IgG1 had similar profile as ch3F8-IgG1 and m3F8 (Table 5). There was low level of crossreactivity with GD1b expressed as percent OD by ELISA relative to the OD on solid phase GD2. There was no cross-reactivity of m3F8, hu3F8 or 14.G2a with human N-CAM,27 either by western blots or by SPR (data not shown).
Direct cytotoxicity. When these antibodies were added to neuroblastoma cells in vitro, they induced direct cell death and slowed down in vitro cell growth. Upon assayed by WST-8 in a 3-d culture system, m3F8 and hu3F8 had similar potency when their EC50s were compared (Table 6). In contrast, 14.G2a was ~10-fold weaker in tumor cell killing.
Antibody potency in ADCC and CMC. Anti-GD2 antibodies were compared in ADCC assays using PBMC and PMN from volunteers as effectors and LAN-1 cells as targets. ADCC potencies of these antibodies were computed as the ratio (EC50 for 3F8)/(EC50 for MoAb) (Table 7). Relative to m3F8, ch3F8IgG1 and hu3F8-IgG1 were ~300-fold stronger in PBMCADCC, and 18-fold stronger in PMN-ADCC. In addition, the maximal cytotoxicity achieved with both chimeric and humanized 3F8 of IgG1 subclass were substantially and consistently higher than that of m3F8 or 14.G2a, irrespective if it was PBMCADCC or PMN-ADCC.
