Abstract. The present study aimed to assess the effects of repairing ventricular septal defects (VSDs) with right vertical infraaxillary miniincision (RVAI). A total of 116 patients with VSDs were prospectively enrolled and underwent cardiac surgery between June 2017 and December 2018 at the cardiac intensive care unit of Shanghai Children's Medical Center (Shanghai, China). Of these, 58 patients underwent the RVAI procedure and 58 patients matched 1:1 underwent the standard median sternotomy incision (MSI) procedure and were desig nated as the control group. The demographic data and clinical outcomes intra and postoperatively were compared. A bedside lung ultrasound was performed to evaluate the degree of lung injury and the number of Blines was quantified and compared between the two groups. The sedation and analgesia levels were also assessed after the operation. No significant difference was identified between the two groups regarding the overall cardiopulmonary bypass or aortic crossclamp time. All patients were extubated within 8 h. The RVAI group had shorter incision lengths (median, 4.6 cm) and less drainage (median, 15 ml) than the MSI group. Furthermore, compared to the MSI group, the RVAI group had a significantly higher number of Blines in the right lung regions immediately after surgery and at 12 h postsurgery (24.1 and 5.2%, respectively) but eventually exhibited no differences at 24 and 36 h post surgery; by contrast, there were no differences in the left lung regions. The bedside bispectral index score and the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale score exhibited no signifi cant differences after the operation. In conclusion, the RVAI

procedure appears to be a safe alternative for repairing VSDs in addition to satisfactory cosmetic results and the incision does not interfere with postoperative analgosedation.
Introduction
Median sternotomy incision (MSI) is considered the usual approach for treating congenital heart defects (CHDs). For simple and common CHDs, such as atrial and ventricular septal defects (VSDs), undesirable cosmetic results and sternotomyrelated complications may limit the number of surgeons who choose to perform median sternotomy procedures (1). Several minimally invasive cardiac surgery techniques have been increasingly explored to overcome these disadvantages (26). Over the past few years, right vertical infraaxillary miniincision (RVAI) has been utilized to obtain reliable cosmetic and functional results in patients with CHDs (7,8). In addition, Dave et al (7) reported that repairs for various congenital defects were similar in quality to standard surgical approaches. However, the patient was placed in a left lateral position and the lung was kept away from the heart during the operation, which may cause detriments to the lung. Irritation to the intercostal nerves during minimally invasive procedures (9) may make postoperative sedation and analgesia difficult. To the best of our knowledge, no similar studies have been reported.
In the present study, MSI and RVAI were compared in terms of their ability to close VSDs, the demographics and clinical outcomes of patients were compared and it was investigated whether this novel technique affects postoperative lung function or postoperative pain.
Materials and methods
Study design. The present study was a prospective cohort study performed at the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) of Shanghai Children's Medical Center (Shanghai, China) and included pediatric patients with VSDs who underwent corrective operations between June 2017 and December 2018. The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine (Shanghai,

Operative technique RVAI approach. After inducing general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position with the right side elevated 4560° and the right arm was wrapped and suspended over the head. A vertical incision was made on the right midaxil lary line of the skin from the second to the fifth ribs and the surgical route generally went through the fourth intercostal space. After the defect was closed, a pericardial drain was inserted. The subcutaneous tissue and skin were sutured in layers (7).
MSI approach. With the patient in the supine position, the heart was exposed through a classic midline sternotomy. The sternum was divided wholly and filled with wax to stop the bleeding. Through aortic, inferior and superior vena caval cannulations, a mildly hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established. After the defect was closed, a pericardial drain was inserted and the divided sternum was closed with nonabsorbable sutures. The subcutaneous tissue and skin were sutured in layers.
Patient selection. All patients included in the present study had VSDs diagnosed by physical examinations, chest Xray, elec trocardiography, transthoracic color Doppler echocardiography and CT. A flow chart of the selection of the study population is provided in Fig. 1. In total, 58 patients underwent surgery with the RVAI technique between June 2017 and December 2018 (RVAI group). To balance the major prognostic factors, a 1:1 matchedpairs casecontrol methodology was designed and the control group underwent the standard MSI procedure (MSI group). The patients of each group were similarly matched in terms of corresponding heart defects, year of surgery, body weight (the difference was 2 kg) and patching (Table I).
The intraoperative variables (aortic clamp time and cardiopulmonary bypass time) were recorded in both groups. Furthermore, the extubation time was evaluated with early extubation defined as mechanical ventilation that lasted for <8 h postoperatively. The incision length and drainage volume were also calculated (Table I).
Lung ultrasonography examination. After the patients returned to the CICU, the right and left lungs were routinely examined by ultrasound (every 12 h) to evaluate the injury with Blines (10) immediately after surgery (H0) at 12 h postoperatively (H12), as well as H24 and H36. The number of Blines was summed up to generate quantitative or semiquantitative Bline scores. The lung ultrasound probe requires a highfrequency linear array of >7.5 MHz. Lung ultrasonography (LUS) examinations were performed according to the methodology described by Copetti and Cattarossi (11). The patients were positioned in a supine, lateral or prone position. The lung field was divided into three areas by the midclavicular line and anterior axillary line. The regions of the bilateral lung were scanned with the probe, which was held vertical or parallel to the ribs. Each region was scanned in the longitudinal and transverse planes and in the mediallateral and cranialcaudal directions, respectively.
Sedation and analgesia assessment. The patients returned to the CICU with a bispectral index score (BIS) monitor (BIS

Vista model; Aspect Medical Systems) until the day they left the CICU. The BIS monitor was able to assess the anes thetic state of the central nervous system. The BIS scores ranged from 0 to 100 (0, coma; 4060, general anesthesia; 6090, sedated; 100, awake) and reflect the level of seda tion (12). The BIS scale was used to assess the sedation level at the CICU every 4 h after the operations (H0, H4, H8, H12;). The Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) scale was used to assess the analgesia level at the bedside after the patient was weaned from ventilation (H8, H12). The FLACC scale consists of 5 categories (face, legs, activity, cry and conso lability), each with a score between 0 and 2, with 10 being the full score; scores of 0 to 3, 4 to 7 and 8 to 10 represent no/light pain, moderate pain and acute pain, respectively. The FLACC scale is reliable and valid for the assessment of systematic pain in children (13). There were no differences in the application of anesthesia, sedation and analgesia medication between the two groups. Both imidazole 2 µg/kg/min and dexmedetomi dine 0.5 µg/kg/h were provided for 16 h.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 19.0 (IBM Corp.). Data following a normal distribution are expressed as the median (range) or as the mean ± standard deviation. Variables were compared between the RVAI and MSI groups using a MannWhitney U test for data with equal proportions or Fisher's exact test where numbers were small with results presented as n (%). The statis tical tests were twosided. All the analyses were performed on an intenttotreat basis and a twosided P<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

Evaluation postoperative lung impairment and analgosedation. In the right lung, the patients in the RVAI group exhibited signifi cantly more Blines on LUS at H0 and H12 than the patients in the MSI group (P<0.05) and the positive detection (>5 Blines) rate of Blines was higher in the RVAI group than in the MSI group (24.1 vs. 5.2% at H0, 17.2 vs. 3.4% at H12). These results have not been previously investigated in the left lung and the number of Blines was not different between groups at H24 and H36 (P>0.05; Fig. 2 and Table II). Patients in both groups exhibited almost the same BIS scores after each 4h interval (P>0.05; Table III) and FLACC scores at H8 and H12 (P>0.05; Table III).

Discussion
In recent years, a minimally invasive cardiac surgery technique (26) has been increasingly explored to avoid midsternotomy scars and deformities and has achieved favorable cosmetic results and excellent repairs. RVAI is an emerging strategy for treating congenital heart disease that uses techniques that aim to minimize incisions and has led to the combination of reliable functional and cosmetic results (7,8). In the present study, 116 patients with VSDs were enrolled between June 2017 and December 2018. MSI and RVAI were compared for their ability to close VSDs and the effects were evaluated intraoperatively and postoperatively.
Various studies have reported on the feasibility of performing the right axillary incision procedure to repair CHDs (3,7). Dave et al (7) reported that right axillary inci sion may be used to repair various congenital defects with a quality similar to that of standard surgical approaches while obtaining a superior cosmetic result compared to conventional incisions. Yan et al (3) also investigated whether RVAI was a safe procedure and determined that RVAI may be performed with excellent cosmetic and clinical outcomes. Similarly, in the present study, no difference in the number of transfusions was identified between the groups, and the MSI group had similar cardiopulmonary bypass and crossclamp times. Cosmetic results are important for patients who undergo surgery to close simple CHDs, and the short incision length and location of the RVAI, the remaining scar of which is hidden by the resting arm, results in satisfactory cosmetic effects (3). Furthermore, the RVAI group had less drainage from the incision than the MSI group; this result may be attributed to the sternum not having been split, which results in less bleeding. Pectus deformities have been reported after standard MSI surgeries to treat CHDs (14). In the present study, no thorax asymmetry was detected in the RVAI group 6 months after operation.
In recent decades, ultrasound has become an important method for diagnostic examinations and monitoring of lung diseases; ultrasound has become an emerging diagnostic tool for diagnosing extravascular lung water with high sensitivity and specificity (15,16). The Blines of ultrasound images are signs of interstitial inflammation and congestion, which is critically important information in various common clinical situations (17,18). In the present study, Blines were applied to nonradioactively and conveniently evaluate lung impairment in the patients after surgery. Of note, in the right lung, patients in the RVAI group exhibited significantly more Blines on LUS at H0 and H12 than those in the MSI group, but the results did not differ in the left lung. The number of Blines was not different between the two groups at H24 and H36. These results indicated that the RVAI procedure may induce congestion or inflammatory reactions in the right lung within 12 h after the operation. However, all patients were extubated within 8 h after the operation and no pneumonia was diagnosed (data not shown). The present results implied that transient lung impairment from RVAI does not affect patient prognosis and all patients recovered rapidly within 24 h.
The BIS score is objective and credible for the evaluation of analgosedation (12). In the present study, the level of postoperative pain was assessed with the BIS and FLACC scores to evaluate whether the RVAI procedure irritated the intercostal nerves

and induced a higher intensity pain than the MSI procedure. A previous study reported that the minimally invasive proce dure may cause intense pain (visual analog scale, 6.3) during the first three days after the operation (9). In the present study, the patients in the two groups had almost the same BIS score postoperatively after each 4h interval. Furthermore, the FLACC scores after being weaned off ventilation were not significantly different between the RVAI group and the MSI control group. All of these results suggested that the RVAI procedure did not irritate the intercostal nerves to cause intense pain.
In conclusion, the RVAI procedure represents a safe alternative for fixing VSDs and leads to satisfactory cosmetic results; no thorax asymmetry was observed. Furthermore, the transient lung impairment of RVAI was rapidly recovered within 24 h and all patients were extubated within 8 h after the operation. The incision did not interfere with postoperative sedation and pain. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first comprehensive evaluation of RVAI to repair VSDs, reporting on the demographics and clinical outcomes of patients and investigating postoperative lung functions and postoperative pain. However, as it was only a singlecenter study, it the present results require to be confirmed by expanding the sample and performing multicenter trials.
