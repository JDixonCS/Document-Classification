Abstract Background and purpose: Although erenumab has demonstrated significant reduction in migraine frequency and improved quality of life in studies lasting 3 to 12 months, little is known about long-term therapy. Methods: This study was an open-label, 5-year treatment phase following a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adults with episodic migraine. Patients initially received open-label erenumab 70 mg, which increased to 140 mg following a protocol amendment. Efficacy analyses included change from baseline in monthly migraine days (MMDs), monthly acute migraine-specific medication (AMSM) days, and health-related quality of life. Results: Of 383 patients enrolled, 250 switched to 140 mg; 215 (56.1%) completed openlabel treatment. Mean (standard error) change in MMDs from baseline of 8.7 (0.2) days was -5.3 (0.3) days; an average reduction of 62.3% at year 5. Among patients using AMSM at baseline (6.3 [2.8] treatment days), mean change in monthly AMSM days was -4.4 (0.3) days at the end of 5 years. Patient-reported outcomes indicated stable improvements in disability, headache impact, and migraine-specific quality of life. Exposure-adjusted patient incidence rates of adverse events (AEs) were 123.0/100 patient-years; AEs were

most frequently nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and influenza. Serious AEs (SAEs) reported by 49 patients (3.8/100 patient-years) were mostly single occurrence. Two fatal adverse events were reported. There were no increases in incidence of AEs, SAEs, or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation over 5 years of exposure. Conclusions: Treatment with erenumab was associated with reductions in migraine frequency and improvements in health-related quality of life that were maintained for at least 5 years. No new safety signals were observed.

INTRODUCTION
Clinical benefits of monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor pathway have been demonstrated in multiple 12- to 24-week double-blind trials with significant reductions in migraine frequency and improved health-related quality of life [1]. Because migraines are often a lifelong disorder, patients may require treatment for many years. Thus, migraine preventive treatments require favorable long-term benefit-risk profiles.
Erenumab (erenumab-aooe in the United States) is a human anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody developed for migraine prevention [2-7] Across the clinical development program, erenumab has been evaluated in over 3,800 patients, representing approximately 3,600 patient-years of exposure [2-6,8] Here, we present extended efficacy and safety data after a 5-year open-label treatment phase (OLTP) following completion of a 12-week double-blind treatment phase (DBTP). Efficacy and safety results from the DBTP, a preplanned, 1-year, open-label interim analysis, and a safety analysis through year 3 of the OLTP have been previously published [5,9,10] This study provides important evidence for sustained efficacy and safety of erenumab treatment over 5 years.
METHODS
Study design
This multicenter, open-label, 256-week (5-year) treatment phase was a continuation of a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted at headache and clinical research centers in North America and Europe (Figure 1). Patients not transitioning directly to commercial erenumab completed an 8- or 12-week safety follow-up depending on completed dose in the OLTP. In the DBTP, patients with episodic migraine (EM) received placebo or erenumab (7 mg, 21 mg, or 70 mg) subcutaneously every 4 weeks [5] In the OLTP, patients received open-label erenumab every 4 weeks, initially 70 mg, increasing to 140 mg following a protocol amendment. Efficacy data were to be collected via a daily electronic diary (eDiary) for the first 52 weeks of the OLTP; a later protocol amendment reinstituted eDiary collection for 4-week periods every 24 weeks (weeks 189-192,

213-216, 237-240, and 261-264) and at weeks 265 to 268 to assess long-term efficacy over OLTP years 4 to 5. Most patients had passed the week 189 to 192 data collection; thus, no efficacy data were collected or reported for that time point. This was a preplanned analysis following OLTP completion of data from all patients who entered the OLTP. Efficacy data were assessed for erenumab 70 mg up to OLTP year 1 and for erenumab 140 mg during years 4 to 5.
Patients
Men and women aged 18 to 60 years who successfully completed the DBTP [5] were eligible for this OLTP study. Eligibility criteria for enrollment in the parent study have been previously reported [5] In brief, key inclusion criteria for the DBTP included history of migraine (4-14 migraine days per month and <15 headache [migraine and nonmigraine] days per month) based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders Second Edition [11] for 12 months prior to screening. Treatment continuation in the OLTP had to be considered appropriate by the investigator.
Study outcomes
Efficacy endpoints included change in monthly migraine days (MMDs), change in monthly acute migraine-specific medication (AMSM) days in patients with baseline AMSM use, and change in health-related quality of life as measured by patient-reported outcomes. The Headache Impact Test (HIT-6 ) is a global measure assessing the previous month's headache severity and change in a patient's clinical status over a short period of time [12,13] The within-person minimally important difference (MID) for the HIT-6 is 5 points reduction [14] Migraine-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (MSQ) measures three dimensions: role function- restrictive (RFR), role function-preventive (RFP), and emotional function (EF), with higher scores indicating better quality of life [15,16] For within-group analyses, the MID is 5.0 for MSQ-RFR, 5.0-7.9 for MSQ-RFP, and 8.0-10.6 for MSQ-EF [17]. Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) is a five-item self-administered questionnaire summing the number of productive days lost in the workplace and home over the past 3 months [18] The total score is

the sum of absenteeism (missed days from paid work, housework, and nonwork activities due to headache) and presenteeism (days at paid work or housework where productivity was reduced by at least one-half) subdomain scores. Although no MID has been established for MIDAS, preliminary analyses based on an anchor of 25% change in monthly headache days estimated that a MIDAS total score decrease of 5 days per 3 months represents meaningful within-person change [19] HIT-6 data were collected every 4 weeks through week 64 and then every 12 weeks through week 268. MSQ data were collected every 4 weeks through week 64 and then at weeks 216, 240, 264, and 268. MIDAS data were collected every 12 weeks up to week 64 and then at weeks 216, 240, 264, and 268. Baseline for all efficacy measures was DBTP baseline.
Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs), vital signs including blood pressure/heart rate, and development of anti-erenumab antibodies. AEs were coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 22.1 [20] Severity was graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 [21] Dose level was classified based on the dose at which the AE occurred. Immunogenicity of erenumab was evaluated using an electrochemiluminescence-based bridging immunoassay for detection of binding anti-erenumab antibodies. For patients whose sera tested positive in the immunoassay, an in vitro biological assay was performed to detect neutralizing anti-erenumab antibodies.
Statistical considerations
All patients who received at least one dose of erenumab in the OLTP were included in the analysis. Descriptive summaries were provided. Data were reported as observed, without imputation for missing data. MMDs and monthly AMSM days were prorated to 28-day equivalents to handle missing daily diary data.
Adverse events were summarized as exposure-adjusted patient incidence rates (total number of patients reporting that event in a given follow-up time period divided by total patient-years of exposure in that period). Total patient-years of exposure was defined as the sum of the duration of exposure from first erenumab dose to the earliest of end-of-study date or first report of event across all patients during the OLTP. For context, exposure-adjusted patient incidence rates during the OLTP were compared with exposure-adjusted patient incidence rates obtained from pooled data from four double-blind treatment studies [2,3,5,6] Immunogenicity of erenumab was assessed for the entire study following first exposure to 70 mg or 140 mg erenumab in either the DBTP or OLTP.

weeks exposure to 70 mg in the OLTP, the dosage in 250 patients remaining in the study was increased to 140 mg, with a median (Q1, Q3) of 140.7 (128.3, 151.7) weeks of exposure. Erenumab treatment was discontinued by 132 patients before the dose increase and by 36 patients while receiving 140 mg after the dose increase. Very few discontinuations were due to AEs or lack of efficacy; most were driven by patient request. Further details on the reasons for patient requests were not captured, such that additional information cannot be provided for these patients.
Efficacy outcomes
Migraine frequency and acute migraine-specific medication use
The significant reduction in MMDs and AMSM use days observed in the 70-mg group during the DBTP was sustained throughout the OLTP (Figure 2).

Mean (standard error [SE]) MMDs among patients enrolled in the OLTP was 8.7 (0.2) days at baseline (prior to double-blind treatment in the parent study). After switching from placebo or lower erenumab dosages (7 mg, 21 mg) to 70 mg at parent study week 12, MMDs reductions similar to those with 70 mg erenumab were observed at week 16, the first efficacy assessment time point of the OLTP (Figure 2a). MMDs reductions were maintained throughout the 5-year OLTP with a mean (SE) change from baseline in MMDs to the last 4-week period of the 5-year OLTP of -5.3 (0.3) days (Figure 2a), reflecting an average MMDs reduction from baseline of 62.3%. The proportion of patients with 50%/75%/100% reduction in MMDs were maintained throughout the 5-year OLTP with response rates of 71.0%/47.1%/35.5%, respectively, over the last 4-week period (Figure 2a and Figure S1).
Among patients using AMSM at baseline, mean (SE) baseline usage was 6.2 (0.2) treatment days. The reduction in AMSM use with 70 mg erenumab, or after switching from lower dosages or placebo, was maintained throughout the 5-year OLTP (Figure 2b). Mean (SE) change from baseline was -4.4 (0.3) days over the last 4-week period at week 268.

Patient-reported outcomes
At baseline, the mean (SE) HIT-6 total score was 60.2 (0.3), and at week 268 it improved to 49.4 (0.6) (Figure 3). Clinically relevant improvements in HIT-6 scores were maintained throughout the study, with 66% of patients achieving 5-point reduction (the within-person MID) in HIT-6 score at week 64 and 73% at week 268 (Figure 3). MSQ-RFR, MSQ-RFP, and MSQ-EF scores improved from baseline and were maintained through week 268 (Figure S2). Similarly, the MIDAS total score, presenteeism, and absenteeism improved from baseline and were maintained through week 268 (Figure S3). Reduction from baseline in MIDAS total score was >5 days, indicative of a clinically meaningful improvement [19]
Safety
Median (Q1, Q3) erenumab exposure among patients receiving 1 dose of open-label erenumab 70 mg or 140 mg (n = 383) was 255 (68, 256) weeks, for a total exposure of 1305.7 patient-years. Exposureadjusted patient incidence rate of AEs was 123.0/100 patient-years (Table 2). The most frequent AEs were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and influenza. Exposure-adjusted patient incidence rates in the OLTP were not increased compared with placebo or erenumab rates from the pooled double-blind placebo-controlled analysis. Eighteen patients (4.7%; 1.3/100 patients-years) reported AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (Table 3). None of the AEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in more than one patient except for rash and depression (each reported in two patients). Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported by 49 patients (12.8%), with an exposure-adjusted incidence rate of 3.8/100 patient-years (Table S1). Exposure-adjusted patient incidence rates of SAEs in the OLTP were not increased compared with the placebo (6.3/100 patient-years) or erenumab rates (5.9/100 patient-years) from the DBTP pooled analysis. Generally, SAEs were isolated events without a clear treatment-related pattern. One SAE (ligament rupture) was reported by three patients,

 | 1721
seven SAEs (osteoarthritis, uterine leiomyoma, adjustment disorder, syncope, appendicitis, deep vein thrombosis, and breast cancer) were reported by two patients. All other SAEs were single occurrence. Two deaths were reported, both assessed as unrelated to erenumab by the investigator. The fatal AE of arteriosclerosis (70 mg), reported as arteriosclerosis and hypertensive heart disease, was confounded by preexisting cardiovascular risk factors and was previously reported [9] as a 54-year-old male with a history of migraine without aura, hypertension, and left anterior hemiblock with a family history of hypertension and heart attack (father died at the age of 39 years). He had received erenumab treatment for approximately 18 months at the time of death. This case was confounded by the presence of a combination of alcohol and cardiac stimulants (including an illicit one) in the setting of severe coronary arteriosclerosis found at autopsy. The other fatality (140 mg) was a 48-year-old male who died unattended with unclear cause of death after 5 years and 1 month of treatment with erenumab. The patient had a medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus. No additional information was provided, and an autopsy was not performed.
There were no new safety signals, increased incidence rates of AEs or SAEs, or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation over 5 years of exposure compared with that observed in the pooled DBTP data. There were no meaningful changes in mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure or heart rate through the end of study after safety follow-up. Mean systolic blood pressure was 118 mm Hg at baseline and 121 mm Hg at safety follow-up, and mean diastolic blood pressure was 75 mm Hg at baseline and 78 mm Hg at safety follow-up. Similar changes were seen in categorical assessment of blood pressure change from baseline.
Immunogenicity
The incidence of binding anti-erenumab antibodies was low, with only a small subset of patients having neutralizing antibodies (Table S2). The incidence of development of binding anti-erenumab antibodies during the entire study after the first erenumab dose of 70 mg or 140 mg was 9.8% (39 of 400; three of whom had in vitro

neutralizing activity). Most anti-erenumab antibodies responses were transient; 76.9% (30/39) of patients who developed binding antibodies and 66.7% (2/3) of patients who developed neutralizing antibodies reverted to negative status by end of study, and the third patient withdrew from the study so subsequent neutralizing antibody status could not be determined. Among those with anti-erenumab antibody responses, most (35/39) occurred during the first year with the majority (23/39) during the first 6 months of treatment; three were observed during the second year, and the last case was observed in year 4 (Table S2). There was no evidence of an association between anti-erenumab antibodies and safety events.
DISCUSSION
Erenumab treatment resulted in long-term durable, clinical improvements including reduction in MMDs and AMSM use, and stable improvements in disability, headache impact, and migraine-specific quality of life. Reductions in MMDs were sustained throughout the OLTP, such that at the end of the 5-year OLTP patients experienced a 5.3-day (62.6% overall) reduction in MMDs compared to parent study baseline. Among patients originally receiving placebo or lower erenumab dosages (7 mg, 21 mg), reductions in MMDs were evident 4 weeks (the first OLTP assessment time point) after patients switched to 70 mg erenumab.
By decreasing migraine frequency, by even a few days, effective preventive treatment can reduce economic and social impacts of migraine resulting from impairments in normal day-to-day tasks or productive work with significant indirect costs (e.g., absenteeism

and presenteeism). Furthermore, capturing the impact of migraine beyond simple counts of migraine days better represents the patient perspective. Erenumab led to sustained, significant improvements consistent across multiple measures of disability, headache impact, and migraine-specific quality of life, with treatment effects exceeding established clinically meaningful differences.
With longer-term exposure for more than 5 years, there was neither an increase over time in incidence rates of AEs nor an occurrence of new AEs. Safety and tolerability profiles during the OLTP (total exposure 1306.0 patient-years) were similar to those observed for erenumab 70 mg (total exposure 267.5 patient-years) and placebo (298.5 patient-years) in the pooled double-blind placebo-controlled analysis. Data from the current analysis suggest no new safety signals with erenumab therapy for more than 5 years in this patient population beyond the safety profile described in the existing product label. Exposure-adjusted patient incidence rates of AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were not increased with longer-term treatment, and there were no new events or apparent dose-dependency of observed events. Patient incidence rates during OLTP for AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were not increased compared with placebo across four pooled erenumab studies [22], where the safety and tolerability profile of erenumab was largely comparable to placebo, confirming previous data.
The trend and extent of blood pressure increase (2-3 mm Hg) over 5 years was similar to age-related blood pressure increases reported in the Framingham Heart Study [23,24] Increased blood pressure with age has been mostly associated with structural changes in arteries, especially with large artery stiffness [25]

Abbreviations:: n, number of patients reporting at least one occurrence of event; r, exposureadjusted incidence rate per 100 patient-years (n/e × 100).

Hypertension rates in this study were lower than those observed in placebo patients in the pooled, double-blind, placebo-controlled analysis (1.9 vs. 3.8/100 patient-years) [22] In the pooled, double-blind, placebo-controlled analysis, constipation was observed at higher rates than placebo [22] However, in the current analysis, constipation did not increase after the parent study, and overall rates were lower than those reported in the pooled, double-blind placebo-controlled analysis (1.8 vs. 7.0/100 patient-years). Furthermore, no patient discontinued due to constipation, indicating that resolution and/or conservative treatments successfully managed the constipation and allowed continued erenumab treatment, consistent with the observation that when constipation occurs, it is most often early after erenumab initiation and tends to dissipate over time [22]
Clinical consequences of immune responses to therapeutic protein products range from no effect to SAEs and/or interference with patient safety and therapy efficacy, making it important to assess new protein therapeutics for potential immunogenicity. Anti-erenumab antibodies incidence remained low, with very few neutralizing antibodies, and did not increase with longer exposure to erenumab. The majority of anti-erenumab antibodies developed within the first 6 months of treatment and were transient in nature.
Retention rates in long-term clinical trials provide an indication of long-term efficacy and tolerability of therapies and thus are of particular importance in chronic conditions. Patient retention rates

at year 3 (62%) and completion rates of the 5-year OLTP (56% of all patients and 86% of those whose dosage was increased to 140 mg) highlight the favorable long-term tolerability profile of erenumab and patient satisfaction with treatment. The 5-year completion rates were impacted by patients who opted to discontinue treatment when the protocol amendment mandated a switch to a higher 140 mg dosage. Discontinuation rates due to AEs were low (5% over 5 years), in contrast to oral migraine preventives associated with high discontinuation rates [26-28] In comparison, in a much shorter 8-month OLTP of pivotal topiramate trials, 29% of participants entering the OLTP withdrew, with 42% of those withdrawing due to an AE [26]
Erenumab appeared effective and well tolerated for at least 5 years in patients with EM. This study is somewhat limited by the observed nature of the data, restricted to patients remaining in the study. Although these results suggest long-term positive clinical effects, the lack of a long-term placebo control group makes it difficult to interpret possible relatedness of an AE by distinguishing spontaneously occurring AEs from AEs due to erenumab. This can be mitigated somewhat by comparisons with DBTP exposure-adjusted patient incidence rates to provide some contextualization.
This analysis represents the longest-term efficacy and safety data of a CGRP pathway antibody to date. Overall, retention rates, efficacy, patient-reported outcomes, and safety results support the use of erenumab as a preventive treatment for patients with EM.
