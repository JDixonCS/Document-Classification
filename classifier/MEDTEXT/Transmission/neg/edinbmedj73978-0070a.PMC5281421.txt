The Revue de VHypnotisme lias already readied its eighth number. It is a medical periodical, devoted mainly to the study of mesmerism, somnambulism, trance, and other similar conditions. It is conducted in a scientific spirit, and with great fairness to all opinions. Charcot, Dumontpallier, and other observers in the Parisian hospitals, have accustomed us to so many wonderful things that the reader will be prepared for something out of the beaten track. Amongst the writers we notice the names of Azam, Luys, Richet, and Auguste Voisin. The school of Paris assumes a direct physical influence, flowing from the mesmeriser or the metal plates applied to the body. The school of Nancy, on the other hand, represented by Bernheim and others, seeks to explain all the manifestations of hypnotism through the influence of mental suggestion, as was done thirty years ago by Braid, whose writings are still esteemed in France. Even accepting this explanation, the phenomena observed are often of a surprising character. They show that the influence of suggestions made in the hypnotic condition are capable of being utilized in mental and nervous diseases, and even in the removal of bad habits and vicious propensities in children. Amongst the diseases thus treated are mentioned incontinence of urine, amenorrhoea, neuralgia, and morphinomania.
