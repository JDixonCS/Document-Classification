A two-parameter class of generator named the alpha power Topp-Leone-G (APTL-G) distribution for generating and engendering up to the minute family of continuous contemporary distributions is proposed. The propounded model has a bathtub and J-shapes hazard rate characteristics in data science. Thus, it has enhanced data analysis because of its productivity. A weighted function of the parent distribution was used to obtain the quantile function for the different sub-models considered. The record values of the differences of the  lower and upper values were obtained in a closed-form to enable its applicability. The APTL-G model parameters values were captured and obtained in their simplified cases by the maximum likelihood approach. A simulation was also adopted to examine and investigate the performance, productivity, efficiency and tractability of the APTLG sub-models. The outcomes of the real-life application and simulation study show that the performance of the goodness-of-fit of the APTL-G model is more flexible and tractable with real-life data sets concerning its goodness-of-fit.

1. Introduction
Despite existing numerous statistical distributions to unravel the distributions of life processes in modelling, there are yet numerous newer tractable and flexible emerging statistical models to harness the true characteristics of observable data set. However, the variability intractability, performance and flexibility of the statistical models may be a result of variability in locations (see [9],[10]). Nevertheless, statistical decision making depends on the probability distribution of the outcome of the underline random processes.
In statistical distribution, most newly developed traditional distributions do not characterise the true characteristics of the data set. This can be seen in their goodness-of-fit with data applications. However, to improve these distributions, families of statistical distributions are being developed to extend, make adequate, and improve existing traditional distributions. Nevertheless, the flexibility, simplicity and tractability of any model is depending on the performance of the goodness-of-fit, parsimoniousness in parameter(s), tractability and simplicity of the true model characteristics in data representation and analysis. Thus, achieving underlined features becomes paramount in data analysis for appli-

cable inference. Hence, in some cases, an additional parameter is added to the classical distributions to obtain a simplified, modified and applicable distribution.
The beta distribution has very important in varieties of scenarios that deal with percentages and proportions that occur randomly (uncertainty). For example, it has been used as a conjugate prior model for geometric, binomial, Bernoulli, and negative binomial distributions. Regardless of how important the beta distribution is, there is a need to improve the tractability and flexibility of the beta distribution for better performance. Thus, the Topp-Leone distribution has served as a better alternative to the beta distribution in reliability theory. This is a result of its J-shaped and boundedness characteristics. Hence, it has found wide importance in the field of reliability and fuzzy theories, risk analysis, economic, actuarial science, spatial statistics, decision sciences, operation research, probabilistic random processes, machine learning, cryptography and uncertainty quality control. Thus, based on the major relevance of the Topp-Leone distribution, there is a need to improve its performance to be able to capture the true character of the data set. Hence, this research introduces a contemporary new family of the generator using the alpha power characteristics.

Several families have proposed generating new distributions in the statistical literature. For example, the transmuted alpha power generator model was proposed in [12]. [4] proposed the Gompertz-G generator. [2] proposed the family of beta transmuted-H distributions. The Transmuted Odd Log-Logistic generator was proposed in [6]. [11] proposed the alpha power Marshall-Olkin generator for improving distributions. The exponentiated generalized generator Poisson distribution was proposed in [7] for generalizing the Poisson models. [13] proposed the alpha power Teissier distribution. The Topp-Leone odd Lindley generator of distributions was proposed in [19]. The transmuted Weibull generator of distributions was proposed in [5]. The Marshall-Olkin generalized generator of distributions was proposed in [22] for adding a parameter to existing models. The transmuted Topp-Leone generator of distributions was proposed in [23].
Motivated by the tractability and performance of the Topp-Leone generator of models, this research introduces a new up to the minute contemporary generator for continuous distribution using the alpha power model transformation for improving contemporary reliability theories and risk analysis. More so, the record values of the proposed model were examined in a closed form to complement its productiveness.
Let  be a sampled random variable, thus the probability density function (pdf) of the Topp-Leone generator is defined as [3] and [20] as
() = 2()(1 - ())(())-(1-)(2 - ())-(1-)   ,  > 0, (1)

and its cumulative distribution function (cdf) is given as  () = (())(2 - ())   ,  > 0, (2)

where () and () are the parent pdf and cdf.

Nevertheless, [16] defined the alpha power transformation pdf and

cdf as

and  () = { ((-)1-) 1 , if  > 0,   1 (4)

2. The APTL-G model

Let  be a random variable sample from the APTL-G distribution. Then, the pdf and cdf of the APTL-G are given as

 2() log   ()-1()[2 - ()]-1

 () = ×(-(1))[2-()] ,

if  > 0,  > 0,   1

where  = 1 - (); () and () are the parent or baseline pdf and cdf respectively.
The quantile function of a random variable  for   Uniform (0, 1) of the APTL-G distribution can be obtained in a closed form as

Table 1 illustrates the skewness and the kurtosis of the proposed model. In Table 1, an increase in parameters values decreases the skewness and kurtosis with the Weibull (W), Gompertz (G) and Frechet (F) models. The kurtosis and skewness were positive in all models. The quantiles in all models are increasing.

Theorem 1. The characteristic demeanor of the APTL-G distribution can be investigated by the attributes of (), f(x), and () with () given as () = log  () for  > 0,   1.

Proof. Suppose that () is given as () = log  (), then, we can express

2

J.T. Eghwerido and F.I. Agu

() = 1 - log( - 1) + log() + log () + log( ())

+( - 1) log () + ( - 1) log(2 - ()) - 1 + log log() + log 2 +[()(2 - ())] log().

Thus,

() = () + () + ( - 1)() - ( - 1)()

()  ()

()

(2 - ())

+-1()()(2 - ()) log() - ()()(2 - ())-1 log().

However, for all  and  < 0,  () is monotonically non-increasing. The mode of the APTL-G proposed model can be obtained by taking the second partial derivative of  as  for values of  = 0,  = 0. More so, suppose the differential  () alternates signs from positive to nonpositive and to positive and again negative as the values of  increase continuously viz-a-viz, then, the proposed APTL-G distribution will be bimodal. Thus, the J-shape of the hazard rate function of the proposed model is established. 

3. Parameter estimation

In this section, the parameters of the proposed model were estimated using the maximum likelihood and a Monte Carlo simulation study.

3.1. Maximum likelihood

Suppose X = (1, 2, ... , ) is a random sample obtained from the APTL-G distribution with unknown parameter vector  = (, , ) . Let
x = (1, 2, ... , ) be a sample values of random sample X. Then, we can obtain the log-likelihood as

  = log 2 +  log  +  log(log ) -  log( - 1) + log (, ) +

(8)

where
  = log (, )(2 - (, )) log .

Nevertheless, taking the partial derivative with respect to the parameters and equating to zero, we have

where () denote derivative. The estimates can not be obtained in a

closed form analytically, thus by solving the nonlinear equations in

Equations (9), (10) and (11) by utilizing the Newton Raphson algorithm

embedded in R software [18].

The APTL-G density and distribution functions is expanded in power

5. Order statistics

In this section, the record values of the APTL-G model will be examined. This will enhance its usefulness in extreme value theory and reliability analysis.
Suppose (1), (2), (3), ... , () are the order statistics for random variable 1, 2, 3, ... ,  sampled from the APTL-G distribution. Then, the APTL-G density  order statistics for   + - {1}, and  > 0 is given as

() = ( - 1)!(! - )! 2( l-og1) () ()-1()[2 - ()]-1()[2-()]

The maximum and minimum record values are obtained when  =  and when  = 1 respectively.

Let  = () for   1 be the  upper record value and 1 = min(1, 2, 3,  , ). Also, let  = () for   1 be the  lower record value with (1) = 1 and 1 = max(1, 2, 3,  , ) and 1 the lower record value for the sequence {  1}. Thus, for 1   <   ), we define the difference of the upper value record as

 = +1 -  =  =  - ,

(25)

and the lower value records as

 =  - +1.

(26)

However, the joint APTL-G density for  <  with  and  upper record values for   + - {1}, and  > 0 is defined as

 () = ( - 1)!2(2-!  - 1)! ( (lo-g1) )2 (27)

6. The APTL-G sub-models

The performance and tractableness of the APTL-G family of density will be examined using the following models. The models were examined based on their performance in the existing literature. These models include the Frechet (F) and Weibull (W) models.

6.1. The APTL-GW distribution

Suppose the pdf and cdf (for   0) of the Weibull distribution is considered, say () =  -1(-() ) and () = 1 - (-() ) respectively, (for  > 0,  > 0). Then, we can express for   + - {1} and  > 0 the
cdf and pdf of the proposed APTL-GW distribution as

 () = (1-(-() ))[1+(-() )] - 1 , ( - 1)
and
 () = 2 log   -1(-2() )(1 - (-() ))-1 ( - 1)
×[1 + (-() )]-1(1-(-() ))[1+(-() )] .

(34) (35)

Otherwise, for  = 1 and  > 0, we have the pdf and the cdf as

 () = 2 -1(-2() )(1 - (-() ))-1[1 + (-() )]-1, and

 () = (1 - (-() ))[1 + (-() )].
The density plot for the proposed APTL-GW distribution for selected values cases of parameters , ,  and  are shown in Fig. 1. The plots in Fig. 1 show that the APTL-G Weibull density could be decreasing, increasing, or skewed to the right or left depending on the desirable values of the parameters adopted.

6.2. The APTL-GF distribution

Assume, we consider the Frechet pdf as () = --1(-(  )) and its cdf as () = (-(  )) for  > 0 and  > 0. Then, we can express the pdf and cdf of the proposed APTL-GF model for   + - {1} and  > 0 as

6.3. Simulation study

A Monte Carlo simulation study is performed to illustrate the per-
formance of the proposed model using the quantile function. The Table
2 shows simulation results. The Weibull model was simulated with  = 3.0,  = 3.0,  = 0.7, and  = 1.5. The Gompertz model was simulated with  = 1.5,  = 1.7,  = 1.5, and  = 0.9. Also, the Frechet model was simulated with  = 1.5,  = 1.7,  = 1.5, and  = 0.9. In Table 2, the per-
formance of the proposed model was examined. The mean estimated
value tends to the true values in all the model considered. More so, the
mean squared errors decrease as the sample size increases.

7. Data applications

The empirical illustrations of the APTL-G distribution were examined using the goodness-of-fit of real-life data sets. The APTLG sub-models were compared with the Weibull Gompertz (WGz),

Information Criteria (AIC), Hannan and Quinn Information Criteria (HQIC), Anderson Darling (A), and Cramér-von Mises (W) test statistics were adopted to obtain the goodness-of-fit.
7.1. First data
The first data as used in [1] is made up of 63 workmen's observations of the strength of 1.5 cm glass fibres at the UK National Physical Laboratory in [21]. The results of the contemporary performance test statistics are displayed in Table 3.
Figs. 3, 4 and 5 show the empirical densities, CDFs and QQ-plots with the first data set for some models.

7.2. Second data
A stress-rupture life data of kevlar 49/epoxy strands were subjected to constant sustained pressure at 90 per cent stress level until all strands had failed and the failure times of the complete data were obtained. The data were studied by [15], [14], and [17]. The data were given as:

8. Conclusion
A two-parameter alpha power Topp-Leone generator has been introduced and examined for tractability, efficiency, performance and flexibility. The new model quantile function was derived and expressed as a weighted baseline CDF. The APTL-G model has been extended to extreme value and reliability theory. However, the quotients and differences  lower and upper record values of the APTL-G model were obtained in a closed-form. The parameters of the formulated APTLG model were obtained in a closed form by the maximum likelihood method of estimation. A Monte Carlo simulation study and two real-life contemporary data were administered to the APTL-G model to validate its productivity of the APTL-G model. The outcomes of the up-to-theminute Monte Carlo simulation study and a real-life application show that the performance of the goodness-of-fit of the APTL-G model is flexible and tractable with real-life data applications.
