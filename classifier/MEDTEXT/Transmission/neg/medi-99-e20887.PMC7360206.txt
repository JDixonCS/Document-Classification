Abstract Background: Dry eye symptom threatens human health and causes a larger burden of disease, the study aims to systematically compare the therapeutic effect of Lycium-rehmannia pills combined with topical eye drops and pure western medicine (western medicine eye drops) on dry eye symptom, to provide a reflection and enlightenment for clinical treatment.
Method: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, EMbase, MEDLINE, CBM, WanFang, VIP, and CNKI databases were searched manually and automatically by the computer until March 2019 and relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected. Article selection and data extraction were conducted by 2 researchers independently, then RevMan 5.3 was applied for meta-analysis.
Result: Fifteen randomized controlled trials were included, including 1222 patients (eyes = 2382). The meta-analysis results showed that Lycium-rehmannia pills combined with western medicine were superior to the control group in terms of therapeutic efficiency [OR = 4.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) (3.26, 5.89), P < .00001]. There were controversial results that the study group was better than the control group in Basic Schirmer test [MD, 2.46, 95% CI (1.49, 3.44), P < .00001], tear break up time [MD, 3.79, 95% CI (3.57, 4.01), P < .00001], and Fluorescein test [MD, À1.29, 95% CI (À1.42, À1.15), P < .00001], but Lycium-rehmannia pills combined with western medicine could not reduce the incidence of adverse reactions, including eyelid inflammation [OR = 1.00, 95% CI (0.37, 2.72), P = 1.00] and congestion symptom [OR = 0.55, 95% CI (0.18, 1.65), P = .28].
Conclusion: Lycium-rehmannia pills combined with western medicine is better than the control group of therapeutic efficiency in the treatment of dry eye symptom. Due to the quantity and quality limitations of the literature, there were controversial results that the study group was better than the control group in Basic Schirmer test, Tear break up time, Fluorescein test, and reduced adverse reactions, including inflammation of the eyelids and congestion. The above conclusion needs more clinical trials to test and verify.

after cataract surgery[2] and other reasons are all likely to induce or aggravate DES.[3]
In recent years, the morbidity of DES increased and was demonstrated a younger trend.[4] Currently, its treatment mainly relies on glucocorticoids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which have certain side effects and tend to cause chronic damage to the eye surface.[5] Therefore, more effective and safe treatments are particularly urgent.[6] With the development of research, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment methods stand out, and there are many treatments.[7] Among the TCM for treating dry eye, Lycium-rehmannia Pills is the most appreciated herbal formula.[8] DES is regarded as "white astringent syndrome," which is believed to be caused by the deficiency of liver and kidney Yin, the long stagnation of wind heat and fluid deficit and other reasons.[9] Lycium-rehmannia Pills is the formula of chrysanthemum, wolfberry, ripe rehmannia, peony skin, dogwood, yam, alisma, poria cob, etc, which has the effects of nourishing liver and kidney, moistening eyes, promoting fluid production, clearing heat, and brightening eyes.[10] TCM is considered to be a better treatment with fewer side effects. In this study, we applied the evidence-based medicine method to systematically evaluate the clinical randomized controlled trails about Lycium-rehmannia Pills and western medicine for the treatment of DES, the western medicine referred to above be simply the eye drops of western medicine ingredients. Based on objective information on related literature, the meta-analysis results can provide a certain reference basis for clinical application.
2. Methods
This systematic review was conducted according to the criteria of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses statement[11] and the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.[12]

2.5. Statistical analysis
The Q statistic test was performed to assess the heterogeneity among studies, I2 judged the size of heterogeneity, if included study has homogeneity (P > .1, I2 < 50%), the combined analysis will use fixed-effects model, if heterogeneity was significant (I2 > 50% and P < .1), the cause of heterogeneity should be analyzed to determine whether random effect model can be used. In this study, the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used as the effect scale indicators because the measurement indicators were binary variables.[14] Sensitivity analysis was carried out based on the sample size, the missing data result, and the methodological quality of the included study. If necessary, we will exclude a low-quality study and repeat the meta-analysis to test the stability of the pooled results. A funnel plot will be used to examine the reporting bias. The results will be calcified based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. RevMan 5.3 was applied for Meta-analysis.

Figure 2. Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgments about each risk of bias item for each included study.
2.4. Risk of bias assessment The methodological quality of each included study was measured independently by 2 authors according to the Cochrane Collaboration's tool.[12] The following contents were evaluated: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other biases.[12] Each domain was judged to a high level, low level, or unclear level.

3. Results
3.1. Basic information of literature
The selective process of eligible studies for the meta-analysis follows the PRISMA flow diagram. According to the retrieval strategy, 43 related studies were initially found, 1 is in English, the rest in Chinese, 2 of which were re-examined. After reading titles and abstracts, 22 of which were excluded, including 14 nonrandomized controlled trials, 3 of which were combined with multiple traditional Chinese medicines, 1 was meta-analysis, and 4 for other reasons (not case-control). Nineteen RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. Four references were excluded according to read the full text because of additional treatments. Finally, 15 studies were included, all of which were RCT. A total of 1222 patients (eyes = 2382) were included, including 612 in the experimental group and 610 in the control group. The flow chart was shown in Fig. 1.
3.2. Basic characteristics and quality evaluation
Among the 15 included studies,[2,15-28] all of them showed that baseline data between 2 groups were comparable through statistical analysis. 86.67% of the studies reported the specific drug dose,[2,15,17-20,22-28] no detailed dosing was reported in 2 article.[16,21] The average course of treatment was about 1 month, while one 1 literature was about 3 months, accounting for 6.67%,[15] the other was 2 months[28] (6.67%). Besides, 6 articles reported grouping by random number table method (40.00%),[19,21-23,25,28] and the rest only mentioned: "randomly divided into 2 groups." Only one of the included studies referred to the implementation of allocation concealment and blindness.[28] Incomplete data reports and data missing problems existed in 1 study (6.67%),[21] and incomplete data reports were not available in the rest. The basic characteristics and quality evaluation of all included studies are shown in Table 1. The Cochrane risk bias assessment of the quality of the article was shown in Figs. 2 and 3.
3.3. Meta-analysis 3.3.1. Therapeutic efficiency. There is a literature on the therapeutic efficiency of treatment not mentioned, a total of 1142 patients were included in 14 RCT studies, including 572 patients in the experimental group with a total of 1114 eyes, and 570

patients in the control group with a total of 1108 eyes. It was shown that there was no statistical significance between the groups by the heterogeneity test [I2 = 38%]. The fixed-effect model was used to perform a meta-analysis. The result has shown that there was a statistically significant difference in the effective rate of Lycium-rehmannia pills combined with western medicine compared with western medicine alone in the treatment of dry eye [OR = 4.38, 95% CI (3.26, 5.89), P < .00001]. The corresponding forest plot was shown in Fig. 4.
3.4. Basic Schirmer test
Basic Schirmer test was evaluated in 10 articles, involving a total of 886 patients with a total of 1772 eyes. Meta-analysis results showed that there was heterogeneity among these studies (P < .00001, I2 = 97%). The random-effect model was applied to perform the meta-analysis. The subgroup analysis was conducted based on the subject age, gender ratio of subjects, and publishing year of articles to analyze the source of heterogeneity. Unfortunately, we did not find the source of heterogeneity. The results that the patients treated by Lyciumrehmannia pills combined with western medicine had a higher Schirmer than the control [MD, 2.46, 95% CI (1.49, 3.44), P < .00001] in the treatment of dry eye symptom need to be verified by more studies, as shown in Fig. 5.
3.5. Tear break up time (BUT)
Tear break up time (BUT) was assessed in 11 studies, involving a total of 958 patients with a total of 1916 eyes. Due to the

extremely high heterogeneity, the random-effect model should be used. One of the studies was heavily weighed in the random effects model, so sensitivity analysis was applied to eliminate the study. After the literature was excluded, subgroup analysis is still needed to study the sources of heterogeneity; however, the results are still inconclusive. According to the BUT, there was a controversial result that the study group was better than the control group [MD, 3.79, 95% CI (3.57, 4.01), P < .00001], as shown in Fig. 6.
3.6. Fluorescein test
Five relevant studies applied Fluorescein test. Due to heterogeneity between studies (P < .00001, I2 = 97%), the random-effect model was selected. However, the result could not provide the certain conclusion. The results showed that Lycium-rehmannia pills combined with western medicine could not reduce fluorescein staining of the cornea compared with the control group [MD, À1.29, 95% CI (À1.42, À1.15), P < .00001], as shown in Fig. 7.
3.7. Clinical adverse reaction--eyelid dermatitis
There were 7 RCT studies on eyelid skin inflammation, including 248 cases of the experimental group and 248 cases of the control group. The results of the fixed-effect model meta-analysis showed that Lycium-rehmannia pills combined with western medicine could not better reduce the incidence of adverse reactions to eyelid skin inflammation compared with the control

group [OR = 1.00, 95% CI (0.37, 2.72), P = 1.00]. The result was shown in Fig. 8.
3.8. Adverse clinical reactions--hyperemia
Seven RCT studies were included, including 248 cases (eyes = 496) in the experimental group and 248 cases of the control group. Meta-analysis results of fixed effect model showed that: compared with western medicine alone, Lycium-rehmannia pills combined with western medicine could not reduce the incidence of ADR congestion in the treatment of Dry eye syndrome [OR = 0.55, 95% CI (0.18, 1.65), P = .28]. The result was shown in Fig. 9.

In this paper, we applied the meta-analysis method to evaluate the improvement on therapeutic effect and reducing adverse reactions to the Lycium-rehmannia pills in the treatment of dry eye symptom. The results showed that the study group revealed more improvement than the control group in total effective rate. It could not effectively reduce adverse reactions (eyelid skin inflammation and congestion), however, due to the incompleteness of the outcome index and the limitation of the follow-up time, the result needs further study. And more high-quality studies are needed to verify effects in Basic Schirmer test, Tear BUT, and Fluorescein test.

3.9. Evaluation of publication bias
To assess the risk of publication bias, efficient funnel plot analysis was carried out for 14 included studies (Fig. 10). It was found that the funnel plot presented a skewed distribution and 1 point fell outside the funnel plot, which indicated that there might be some publication bias in the data.

4. Discussion
In Traditional Chinese medicine, DES is regarded as "white astringent," "Shen Shui will dry," and "dryness syndrome." The cause of the disease is complex, and there is no special treatment method, and traditional Chinese medicine is expected to be the preferred method for treating dry eye disease.[29]

At the same time, many included studies are of low quality. There is a limited amount of data, and all of them are acquired in China. In the case of random control test design, there is no detailed explanation of the random method, and most of the literature does not mention the implementation of blind method and the hidden grouping, and several articles have incomplete reports, so they are easy to lead to random bias, implementation bias, and measurement bias, which all have a certain degree of influence on the research results. In the adverse reactions, the lack of objective and detailed adverse reactions causes a certain problem and influences on the final results. Also, the lack of longterm effect and the recurrence of the patient cause some limitations on the judgment. The future of the case of dry eye disease should be noted in the following aspects: The method is designed strictly by the randomized controlled test, and the risk of bias is reduced; To improve the outcome indicators and report the occurrence of adverse reactions; The clinical effect is as close to the actual situation as possible.
In summary, Lycium-rehmannia pills were significantly improved eye symptoms, but the difference in the incidence of adverse reactions is not statistically significant, and the metaanalysis provides a reflection and enlightenment for the clinical treatment of dry eye disease. As the insufficient high-quality RCTs and publication bias, it still needs to be further verified by large, high-quality, and multicenter RCT.
