Me. ARCHIBALD NEILSON, J.P., L.R.C.P.Edin., L.F.P.S.Glasg.
Glasgow.
Mr. Archibald Neilson, who died on 19th September, at the
advanced age of 94 years, was for a great many years a very
well known figure in the East End of Glasgow. Mr. Neilson qualified in 1865, and for many years resided at 10 Sommerville Place, where he conducted a busy practice. He took an active interest in municipal affairs, and sat in the Town Council for several years as one of the representatives of the Fourth Ward, becoming a member of several committees in which his professional knowledge was valuable. He was kindly by nature, and always ready with a word of encouragement for a junior practitioner.
