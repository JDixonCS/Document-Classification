ABSTRACT
The composition of the insoluble "integuments" and soluble "contents" fractions of spores of four Bacillus species of widely differing heat resistance were compared. Electron microscopy of thin sections was also used to determine and compare the morphological structures in the integument preparations. The soluble fractions of the thermophiles, B. coagulans and B. stearothermophilus, had a higher content of hexose and dipicolinic acid. The hexose content of both fractions of the four species was related to heat resistance. Integument fractions consisted chiefly of protein together with variable amounts of the mucopeptide constituents, a, e-diaminopimelic acid (DAP) and hexosamine. In the thermophiles the DAP and hexosamine were found chiefly in the insoluble integuments fractions, while in B. cereus and B. subtilis most of this material was soluble. Integument preparations, containing mainly protein with little mucopeptide, consisted chiefly of outer and inner spore coats, while preparations having more mucopeptide contained also residual cortical material and a cortical membrane (possibly the germ cell wall). The results suggest that spore integuments consist of mainly proteinaceous outer and inner coats together with variable amounts of residual cortex and cortical membrane which contain the mucopeptide material.

INTRODUCTION

Studies on the composition of spores have been concerned with spore coat preparations (30, 32, 40), germination exudates (25, 35), or specific constituents such as dipicolinic acid (DPA) (3, 18, 37), phosphorus fractions (7), or inorganic cations (4, 37). The chemical composition of individual morphological components of the spore other than coat preparations has not been defined. In view of the possible role of the spore integuments, in stabilizing the protoplasm by excluding water by mechanisms such as water impermeability (10, 27) or the postulated contractile cortex of Lewis et al. (20), a comparison of the composition and morphological structure of the integuments of several species was desirable.
Recent evidence suggests that the spore "core"

may contain the dipicolinic acid (11), and that most of the mineral matter may be located in the cortical region (17). Chemical analyses of preparations of spore integuments, variously referred to as "coats" (13, 32), "membranes" (40), or "walls" (30), show these to consist largely of protein. Most of these preparations also contained diaminopimelic acid (DAP) or hexosamine, indicating the presence of some "spore peptide" material. The spore peptide (35) is released from germinating spores and from the insoluble fraction of disintegrated spores, probably by the action of lytic enzymes present in the spore (33, 34). Mayall and Robinow (22) observed that the cortex breaks down during germination and suggested that the spore peptides may come from the cortex.

Lewis et al. (20) have assumed it to be of "unusual biochemical composition" in support of their hypothesis of a contractile cortex.
In the studies on the composition of spore coats it is not clear which of the several spore integuments (22, 24) were present in most of the coat preparations, as sections were not examined in the electron microscope. The presence of DAP and hexosamine in the coat preparations may have been due to adhering cortical material if the cortex is the site of the spore peptide.
In this study, comparative analyses of the composition of the soluble "contents" and insoluble "integuments" from disrupted spores of four species with a wide range of heat resistance have been made. Electron microscopy of sectioned material was used to determine the morphological components present in the integument preparations analyzed, and to compare the structure of integuments in each species.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Organisms
Spores of the following organisms were used: Bacillus cereus (Knaysi strain C3), Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus coagulans (strain 320), and Bacillus stearothermophilus (ATCC 7953; N C A strain 1518).
Preparation of Spore Crops
T h e spores were grown in 14 liter lots of medium, vigorously aerated in 20 liter botdes, with silicone antifoam A added to prevent foaming. B. coagulans and B. stearothermoaOhiluswere grown at 50°C and the other species at 30°C. B. coagulans was grown in a medium containing 0.5 per cent casamino acids (Difco), 0.5 per cent casitone (Difco), 0.1 per cent yeast extract (Difco), and a salt mixture (24). The other organisms were grown on potato infusion medium (26). For B. stearothermophilus the potato infusion was used at half strength and supplemented with the salt mixture. Residual vegetative ceils and sporangia in the crops of B. coagulans and B. stearothermoflhilus were removed by treatment with papain (1 m g / m l ) at 1°C for 2 to 3 weeks in the presence of 0. I per cent l : l chloroform-toluene mixture. Each spore crop was washed 8 times with water to give a clean preparation (>99 per cent free spores).
Heat resistance was determined by survival counts on dextrose tryptone agar after heating spore suspensions (1.5 ml of a 106/ml suspension in 75 X 9 m m ampoules) in 0.05 M phosphate buffer, p H 7, at 100 ° or i 10°C -4- 0,05 ° for various periods. For comparison of decimal reduction times (D) at 110°Cl, Dl10o values

were computed from Dr00o values assuming a temperature coefficient (Q10) of 10 (z = 18°F).
Preparation of Spore Fractions
Spore suspensions (10 ml, 30 mg/ml) were shaken in bottles 3 X 1¼ inches in diameter with 20 g m of 0.1 mm glass beads (Chance Brothers, Smethwick, England, grade 12-13), and 2 drops tri-n-butyl citrate as an antifoam, on a reciprocating shaker (940 X I inch oscillations per minute) at I°C. Shaking was continued until practically no refractile or stainable intact spores remained, but was stopped before the spores were disintegrated into unidentifiable fragments. Spores of B. cereus and B. subtilis tended to remain in typical laterally split forms after 20 to 30 minutes shaking, while spores of B. coagulans and B. stearothermophilus disintegrated more readily into small fragments. Disrupted suspensions, from 4 to 6 gm spores, were separated from the beads by decanting and passage through a no. 2 sintered glass filter. T h e insoluble material was sedimented (10,000 g, 15 minutes at 0°C) to give integument preparations (I fractions) which were washed 6 to 8 times with water and freeze-dried. The combined supernatants, containing all the water-soluble spore material, were freeze-dried to give the soluble or spore "contents" fraction (S). Before analysis, fractions were stored at room temperature in vacuo over P205. Centrifuging disrupted spores of B. coagulans gave a s e d i m e n t with two distinct layers. The upper and lower layers were separated by several fractional resuspensions until homogeneous sediments were obtained. The upper layer will be referred to as fraction L (light) and the lower as H (heavy).
Electron Microscopy
Disrupted spore fractions were fixed with osmium tetroxide by the m e t h o d of Kellenberger et al. (16) and embedded in Araldite (9). The blocks were sectioned onto 20 per cent acetone and observed in a Siemens Elmiskop I electron microscope.
Analytical Methods
Except for carbohydrate estimations, the analytical figures reported are the average of determinations on two samples.
Total nitrogen was estimated by the Kjeldahl method of McKenzic and Wallace (23). A digestion time of 45 minutes was used since other digestion procedures gave low recoveries of N from dipicolinic acid.
a-Carboxylic amino N was estimated on 6 N HC1 (16 hours, 107°C) hydrolyzates by the manometric method of V a n Slyke et al. (36).
Phosphorus was determined by Allen's (1) method. Hexosamine was estimated after hydrolysis, by

580 T~IE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY · VOLUME 16, 1963

the Rondle and Morgan (28) method using a glueosamine standard. Muramic acid gives a lower color yield than glucosamine (31). Hydrolysis was carried out for 5 hours at 100°C in 6 N HC1, which was found to be optimum for B. coagulans spores.
Dipieolinic acid (DPA) was estimated from the absorbance at 273 m/~ of an aqueous solution of ether extracts of spore fractions acidified with 0.1 N HC1.
Sugars were identified by paper chromatography of deionized 2 N HC1 hydrolyzates, using the solvents ethyl acetate + pyridine + water (2:1:2 v/v), n-butanol + acetic acid + water (18:2:5 v/v), and 80 per cent aqueous phenol. Descending chromatograms were run on Whatman no. 1 paper for 24 to 40 hours. Spots were detected with p-anisidine, aniline hydrogen phthalate, and alkaline silver nitrate. Total carbohydrate was estimated by the anthrone method (12) and rhamnose by the method of Dische and Shettles (6). A correction, due to rhamnose present, was applied to the anthrone results to give the hexose content, expressed as glucose, the principal sugar. Ribose, which was generally present, enhanced the extinction given by glucose in the anthrone reaction (14), and a glucoseribose standard was used. Carbohydrate found by this reaction would be overestimated when greater quantities of ribose were present, but underestimated when galactose or mannose was present.
Amino acids were estimated by the method of Kay et al. (15) after separation of neutral and acidic amino acids by two-dimensional paper chromatography (19), and of basic amino acids and glucosamine by paper electrophoresis in collidine-acetic acid buffer (pH 6.6) for 100 minutes at 50 v/cm.
RESULTS
Electron Microscopy of Insoluble Fractions
Electron micrographs of thin sections of spores have revealed a number of integuments surrounding the spore protoplasm (Fig. 1), (24). It was therefore necessary to define which of these were present in each of the fractions analyzed and to compare the morphological structures in each species. Electron micrographs of thin sections of the insoluble fractions (Figs. 2 to 5) showed the presence of four morphological components. These were (a) the electron-opaque outer coat, (b) an underlying laminated inner spore coat, (c) cortical material, a n d (d) a thin cortical membrane. The appearance and structure of these components are shown more clearly in

electron micrographs of partially disrupted or disrupted spores (Figs. 6 to 9).
Outer and inner coats, which usually remained attached to each other, were major components in each preparation used for analysis (Figs. 2 to 5). The B. cereus and B. subtilis I fractions (Figs. 2 and 3) consisted chiefly of the two spore coats. T h e outer coat was m u c h t h i n n e r in B. stearothermophilus (Figs. 5 a n d 12) t h a n in the other species. In B. cereus and B. subtilis the outer coat showed a network type of structure (Figs. 2, 3, 6, a n d 7) not seen in B. coagulans (Figs. 4 a n d 8) a n d B. stearothermophilus (Figs. 5 a n d 9), where the structure had a uniform fine-grained appearance. The inner coat was seen to be laminated and similar in appearance in all the species. Cortical material, often attached to the inner spore coat, was present in considerable amount in B. coagulans a n d B. stearothermophilus I fractions (Figs. 4 and 5). Much smaller quantities were found in the B. cereus and B. subtilis preparations (Figs. 2 and 3). The cortical material in micrographs of disrupted spores had the appearance of a structural residue from which soluble constituents h a d been leached (Figs. 4, 5, 7, a n d 8). Partial autolytic degradation of the cortex may have occurred during preparation of the fractions. A membrane component, clearly distinct from either of the coat layers, was present in B. coagulans, B. subtilis, a n d B. stearothermophilus. In m a n y electron micrographs (Figs. 3 to 5, 7, and 8), this membrane remained attached to the inner surface of the cortex. In a partly disrupted spore (Figs. 1 and 9) it is located between the cortex and the spore protoplasmic membrane and may be the germ cell wall. Until further evidence is obtained on the nature of this membrane, it will be referred to as the "cortical memb r a n e . " I n B. coagulans most of these cortical membranes were concentrated in the L fraction.
Analyses of Insoluble Fractions
The results for four species together with the ratios of the heat resistance of the spores from which the integuments were prepared are given in Table I. Generally a higher proportion of insoluble material was obtained from the more heat-resistant species, B. coagulans a n d B. stearothermophilus, b u t this would be affected slightly by losses during preparation. Greater amounts of hexosamine occurred in the I fractions of the more heat-resistant spores. Small amounts of

several sugars, including traces of ribose, were present in all spore fractions (Tables I, II). Hexose estimation was subject to errors due to the complex mixture of component sugars, interference from proteins and amino acids, and the effect of ribose present (see Methods). The hexose content of both I and S fractions was related to heat resistance (Tables I, IV). No uronic acids were detected by the Dische carbazole method (5) and no polyols were detected on paper chromatograms of the 2 N HC1 hydrolyzates with alkaline silver nitrate. Significant amounts of phosphorus were present in each I fraction (Table I).
The amino acid constituents of the I fractions were estimated semiquantitatively after paper chromatographic separation (Table III). Other amino acids common to protein hydrolyzates, including cystine, proline, and methionine, were present, but were not estimated. No hydroxyproline or fl-alanine was detected. The typical spore peptide constituents (DAP, glucosamine, and muramic acid) were also present, although a considerable loss of amino sugars had occurred during hydrolysis. The relative content of the

spore peptide constituents increased with an increase in heat resistance of the spores (Tables I, III). Amino acids derived from the protein component, in particular glycine and tyrosine, tended to be present in inverse proportion to DAP, hexosamine, and heat resistance.
Ultraviolet Absorption Spectra of Spore Coat
Extracts
The occurrence of both ribose and phosphorus in spore integument preparations suggested the presence of nucleic acid. As Barkulis and Jones (2) have shown that the presence of ultravioletabsorbing material cannot be properly demonstrated by spectrophotometry of cell wall suspensions, the ultraviolet spectra of hot acid extracts (2) were examined. Extracts from each of the I fractions showed significant ultraviolet absorption (Fig. 10). A peak at 255 m # was present in the B. stearothermophilus extract, which corresponded, according to spectrophotometric data (21), to a maximum RNA content of 4 to 5 per cent. The RNA may be present, adsorbed upon the spore coats, as is found with the streptococcal cell walls (2). The other extracts showed much

less absorption than that of B. stearothermophilus at 255 m# and had a maximum at 270 m#, suggesting the presence of DPA. In the B. coagulans H and L extracts, both of which showed a more intense a n d distinct m a x i m u m t h a n B. cereus or B. subtilis, no more than 1 per cent DPA would be present according to calculations.
Analyses of Soluble Fractions
Analyses of the soluble component of spores are given in Table IV. The concentration of DPA in these fractions increased strikingly with heat resistance mainly because the DPA, on disruption of the spore, goes into the soluble fraction, and less soluble material was obtained from the more heat-resistant species. It was only with B. stearothermophilus that whole spores showed a greater DPA content (38). Most of the hexosamine in B. cereus and B. subtilis spores was fractionated

into the soluble fraction, whereas in B. coagulans and B. stearothermophilus the hexosamine was associated chiefly with the insoluble integuments. The difference in the proportion of soluble to insoluble material obtained from the different species appears to be due largely to the degree of solubilization of the hexosamine-containing component. The amino acid patterns of hydrolyzed S fractions were similar to those of hydrolyzed I fractions (Table III) except that no cystine was detected in the former. The spore hexose and phosphorus contents (Tables I, II, IV, V) were not associated specifically with either the I or the S fractions, except that in B. stearothermophilus more glucose occurred in the I and mannose mainly in the S fraction. Rhamnose, when present, was predominantly in the S fraction (Tables I, II, IV).

proved possible to separate these layers by resuspending each layer in turn, and purifying each separated layer by further centrifugations and resuspensions (fractional resuspension).
The effect of the fractionation was studied by chemical analysis and electron microscopy. The two insoluble fractions obtained from B. coagulans (H and L) were analyzed with the other integument preparations (Tables I, II, III). The B. stearothermophilus preparation gave three insoluble fractions. Analytical data are given in Tables III and V. In both species the uppermost layer in the sediment contained more DAP, glucosamine, and alanine, and correspondingly less of the other amino acids, particularly tyrosine and glycine.

The lighter fractions consisted mainly of cortex and cortical membranes (Fig. 11), but coat fragments were also present. Protein matter, not removed by washing with water, may have been present in integument preparations, and silicone antifoam was probably adsorbed on the coat layers.

tures. This possibility has been confirmed by enzyme studies, which are described in the following paper (39).
DISCUSSION
Electron microscopy of sectioned material has demonstrated that so-called spore coat preparations are variable mixtures of several of the spore integuments. The value of analyses of these preparations, in defining the chemical composition of particular spore integuments, therefore, is limited. Further progress in this respect will be greatly assisted by the development of techniques for separating the morphological components of the spore. Fractional resuspension by itself did not achieve a complete separation of components from disrupted spores. Methods are at present under study for parting the coat layers from each other, and for complete fractionation of the spore integuments. Homogeneous preparations of the inner and outer coats of B. coagulans have been obtained by treating disrupted spores with lysozyme to dissolve the residual cortex and cortical membrane, and with trypsin to digest cytoplasmic protein.
The structure of the spores of these species as revealed by thin sections of disrupted spores indicated that they have a similar morphological organization in that they are composed of two coats, cortex and cortical membrane, around the spore protoplasm (cf. 24). The structure of the outer coat, however, shows differences between the species, varying from the loose network type of structure in B. cereus and B. subtilis to the very electron-opaque structure in B. coagulans and the thin outer coat of B. stearothermophilus. These differences may be related to their resistant properties. The inner coat in each species appeared lami-

The analytical results for the preparations containing most spore coat and least cortical material, B. stearothermophilus fraction 1 a n d the B. cereus a n d B. subtilis I fractions, suggest t h a t the spore coats consist mainly of protein. The hexosamine-DAP component appeared to be associated specifically with the residual cortex and cortical membrane,

phorus content (Table I). The absence of ribitoltype compounds (30) and, except in the B. stearothermophilus coat preparation, the absence of sufficient amounts of nucleic acid to account for it, suggest that the phosphorus may be present in a "residual P " fraction as reported in B. megaterium spores by Fitz-James (7). Fitz-James and Young (8) correlated a high residual P content of coat preparations from strains of B. megaterium with the presence of a dense outer coat. Our observation t h a t B. stearothermophilus possessed a m u c h t h i n n e r outer coat, and had much less phosphorus than the other species, supports their conclusion that

since in the various fractions those containing the most hexosamine and DAP also contained the most cortex and cortical membrane. In the following paper (39) more detailed evidence will be presented to support this conclusion. Variation in the amount of mucopeptide or cortical material in the integument preparations of different organisms probably arises from differences in the rate of autolytic degradation of the cortex occurring during the disruption and washing procedures. The spore coat preparations of Strange and Dark (32), Sahon and Marshall (30), and Hunnell and Ordall (13) all contained small amounts of hexosamine or DAP and so probably contained residual cortical material in addition to the spore coats.
As previously reported (30, 32), many spore coat preparations have a relatively high phos-

the residual P occurs in the dense outer spore coat. Higher amounts of sugars in both the soluble and insoluble fractions of B. stearothermophilus m a y suggest important differences in composition of the spores of this species, which forms the most heatresistant spores known. Carbohydrate constituents have not been identified previously in spores or spore coats. T h e presence of rhamnose in B. cereus a n d B. subtilis spores (Table II) but not in their vegetative cells (29, 30, 40) suggests that the carbohydrate components are from spores and not residues of vegetative cells.
The correlation which appeared between heat resistance and the DPA concentration in the soluble fraction of spores does not necessarily mean that a higher concentration of DPA exists

in the protoplasm of the more heat-resistant species. It is not certain where the DPA is located in the spore, and varying amounts of soluble material including the spore peptide component may be derived from other regions of the spore

such as the cortex. Possibly some protoplasmic material such as nucleic acid or protein, particularly in the more heat-resistant species, was fractionated with the coat material.
