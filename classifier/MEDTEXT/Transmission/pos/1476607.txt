In this paper, a mathematical model based on a system of ordinary di erential equations is developed with vaccination as an intervention for the transmission dynamics of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). e model solutions are shown to be well posed.
e vaccine reproduction number is computed by using the next-generation matrix approach. e sensitivity analysis carried out on this model showed that the vaccination rate and vaccine e cacy are among the most sensitive parameters of the vaccine reproduction number, RV. e optimal control problem is solved with the rate of vaccination and the transition rate from the vaccinated class to the infected class as control variables. Finally, the numerical simulations showed that the control intervention should aim to increase the vaccination rate with a high-e cacy vaccine.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). e increasing prevalence rate of the virus nearly devastated healthcare systems across the world [1, 2]. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease a global health pandemic. It is transmitted through inhalation of respiratory droplets from an infectious person emitted through sneezing, coughing, and having a close conversation, as well as contact with contaminated surfaces [3]. e infection prominently a ects the respiratory tract. e initial COVID-19 symptoms are fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Other symptoms include body aches and pains, a sore throat, diarrhoea, headache, loss of taste and smell, breathing di culties, skin rash, and discoloration of the
ngers and toes [3]. COVID-19 morbidity and mortality can be compounded
by pre-existing diseases such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cancer, infectious diseases, and substance abuse. Furthermore, pre-existing conditions such as environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic factors may in uence the COVID-19 incidence rate [4]. To prevent and

control the spread of COVID-19, health providers and governments around the world implemented containment measures such as lockdowns, travel bans, cessation of movement, social distancing, proper hygiene, and proper hand washing, among others. Despite these safeguards, the virus continues to spread, although at a slow rate.
Vaccination has been a major public health tool in modern medicine used to minimize the impact of many infectious diseases on humans [5, 6]. A vaccine is any biologically derived substance that elicits a protective immune response when administered to a susceptible host. Vaccines help the body to prepare for disease by taking the advantage of the fact that immunity knows how to defend against infectious organisms, which are typically viruses, bacteria, or toxins [7]. Given the emergence of highly transmissible new variants, decreased vaccine e ectiveness, and unequal vaccine availability, there is a growing concern that vaccination may not result in herd immunity. Vaccines reduce the risk of severe disease and death; therefore, a country's vaccine coverage must be high in order to protect the healthcare system from an infection surge [2]. Since late 2020, several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that are more transmissible and/or vaccine-resistant have been identi ed [8].

In modern medicine, vaccination has been an important public health technique for reducing the burden of many human infectious diseases [5, 6, 9]. Several COVID-19 vaccine candidates have been developed and are already in use [10]. Vaccines such as Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sputnik, Sinopharm, Johnson & Johnson, and many others are currently being administered around the world to date. It is a social responsibility choice of an individual to get vaccinated. However, offsetting the fear and adverse side effects of the vaccine has to be carried out[11]. e shortage of supply of COVID-19 vaccines in many developing countries has resulted in the implementation of different immunization strategies, with varying results. For example, in Kenya, prioritization is given to the adult population [2].
A mathematical model provides insight into infectious disease transmission and control [12, 13]. Many mathematical models on the dynamics of COVID-19 with control strategies have been developed and studied, for example, in studies carried out in [9, 10]. Optimal control is regarded as a powerful mathematical tool for optimizing control problems in various fields [14-18]. In the context of vaccination, the dynamics of disease transmission and immunity in a population are typically modelled by using network compartmental approaches [19]. A mathematical model for the dynamics of COVID-19 is presented in [18]. An optimal control function is added to the model in order to effectively control the outbreak. e main controls are isolation, quarantine, and hospitalization. e result shows that adopting the available control measures to their full potential will greatly reduce infectious populations.
A new COVID-19 model with an optimal control analysis is presented in [20]. e authors considered four different controls to develop an optimal control model, including prevention, vaccination control, rapid screening of people who are exposed, and people who are infected without screening. e forward-backward Runge-Kutta method is used to resolve the model with and without control. e findings suggest that control can be useful for reducing infected individuals and improving population health. A novel fractional-order mathematical model that explains the behaviour of COVID-19 in Ethiopia is developed and analyzed in [21]. An inexact Newton iterative method is used to solve the model system. e model considers the impact of various control techniques on disease transmission.
Zamir et al. in [22] developed a mathematical model to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. e study used a nonclinical approach to investigate optimal control. A COVID-19 mathematical model that takes into account the susceptible, exposed, infected, asymptotic, quarantine/isolation, and recovered classes is developed and analyzed in [23]. Elasticity and sensitivity analysis shows that the model is more sensitive to transmission rates from infected to exposed classes than transmission rates from susceptible to exposed classes.
Alqarni et al. [24] developed a new mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of the coronavirus (COVID19) using cases reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from March 2, 2020, to July 31, 2020. e model's stability

results are shown when the basic reproduction number is R0 < 1, and the model is locally asymptotically stable. Using the PRCC method, they show some important parameters that are more sensitive to the basic reproduction number R0.
e sensitive parameters that act as control parameters and can reduce and control infection in the population are depicted graphically. e study results suggested that if controls are followed, the infection rate in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia can be reduced significantly. In this study, an extended SEIR COVID-19 dynamics model with vaccination is proposed to investigate the impact of vaccination as a control intervention on the pandemic spread.

2. Model Formulation

A

susceptible-vaccinated-exposed-infected-recovered

(SVEIR) model with a standard incidence rate is developed

and analyzed. Despite the fact that there are underlying

conditions that predispose someone to a higher risk of

contracting COVID-19 disease, the population under study

is assumed to have an equal level of susceptibility. Indi-

viduals in this category are known as susceptible individuals

denoted by S(t). Several COVID-19 vaccine candidates have

been developed and are already in use [10]. Individuals who

have been vaccinated are hereby categorised as the vacci-

nated class, denoted by V(t). When susceptible individuals

are exposed to the virus, they undergo an incubation period,

which is the time between virus exposure and the onset of

symptoms. is is on average 5-6 days, but it can be as long

as 14 days [25]. e incubating individuals in this study are

categorised as the exposed class denoted by E(t). Following

the end of the exposure period, the incubating individual's

transit into the infection class is denoted by I(t). e in-

fectious potential of COVID-19 is significantly greater just

before or within the first five days of symptom onset [26].

e infected class I(t), in this study, includes both pre-

symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Depending on the

severity of symptoms and the intervention strategies in

place, the infected individuals may die or recover from the

disease. us, the class R(t) denotes the number of indi-

viduals who have recovered from the infection. e study

assumes that infection with COVID-19 confers temporary

immunity upon recovery.

e recruitment of individuals into the susceptible class

is through births at the per capita rate . Following an

outbreak of the disease, several containment measures are

implemented to control the spread. e susceptible humans

acquire infection from an infectious individual via a force of

infection I, where  is the transmission coefficient. e

saturated incidence rates given by SI/1 + I and

1VI/1 + I tend to the saturation level when I grows large.

e constant  measures the saturation effects caused by

infective individuals in the presence of containment mea-

sures. e proportion of vaccination is given by c,

(0 < c  1). e transmission coefficient of the vaccinees is

denoted by 1:  (1 - ), where the parameter ,

(0 <   1) measures the vaccine efficacy. e vaccinees are

considered to have acquired partial immunity against

COVID-19 subject to the type of vaccine (efficacy level)

3. Well-Posedness of the Model

In this section, well-posedness of the model solutions is discussed. Model (1) describes the human population, and therefore, its solutions, as shown below, are positive and bounded for all time t  0.

Using Proposition 1 below, the model solutions are shown to be bounded for all t  0 in the region .

Proposition 1. For all time t  0, the solutions of model (1) are invariant in the region .

Proof. e solutions of model (1) are positively invariant of , i.e., all solutions start in  and remain in the region  for all t  0. e rate of change of human population N(t) is given by

dN dS + dV + dE + dI + dR.

Hence, all solutions of model (1) are bounded in the

region .



3.2. Positivity of Solutions

Proposition 2. All solution sets {S(t), V(t), E(t), I(t), R(t)} of model (1) with non-negative initial conditions are positive t > 0.
Proof. Considering the rst equation in model (1), that is,

In a similar way, all the other variables can be shown to

be positive t  0. Hence, all solutions of model (1) are

positive in the region .

Clearly, from Propositions 1 and 2, all solutions of model

(1) are shown to be positively invariant in the region . us,

model (1) is mathematically and epidemiologically well

posed in a biological feasible region .



4. The Vaccine Reproduction Number and the Disease-Free Equilibrium
In this section, the disease-free equilibrium and the vaccine reproduction number RV of the model (1) are computed.

4.1. e Disease-Free Equilibrium. e disease-free equilibrium (DFE) point of model (1) is defined as the state in which there is no COVID-19 infection in the population under study.
Proposition 3. ere exists a DFE of model (1) given by E0  S0, V0, E0, I0, R0   + c, (c+ c), 0, 0, 0. (12)
Proof. At the disease-free equilibrium point, there is no infection in the population. erefore, with E  I  R  0, then model (1) is given as follows:
 - SI - ( + c)S  0, 1 + I
cS - 1VI - V  0, 1 + I
S + 1VI - ( + )E  0, (13) 1 + I

4.2. Reproduction Number. e basic reproduction number, usually denoted by R0, is defined as the average number of secondary infections due to a single infectious individual introduced into a fully susceptible population during his/her period of infectivity [29]. e basic reproduction number is the spectral radius of the matrix, FV- 1, R0  (FV- 1), where F and V are the next-generation matrices [30]. e operator FV- 1, the next generation matrix, is formed from matrices of partial derivatives of Fi (the rate of appearance of new infection in the ith compartment) and Vi  V-i - V+i (the rate of transfer/transition rate in and out of the disease compartment i) with respect to the infected compartments (E and I) evaluated at DFE. e matrices F and V are given by

e vaccine reproduction number, RV, is the measure of

the severity of an epidemic in the presence of vaccination

and one of the most important parameters since it deter-

mines whether or not the disease will invade a population.

Epidemiologically, if RV < 1, then by definition, the infection

does not spread in the population. On the other hand, if

RV > 1, then the infection spreads in the population and may

result into an epidemic.

5. Sensitivity Analysis

e degree to which an input parameter influences a model's output is known as parameter sensitivity. Sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number can be used to develop a mitigation strategy that will slow the spread of the pandemic by lowering RV [14]. Sensitive parameters are those that have a significant impact on the transmission dynamics of an infection. Using the normalized forward sensitivity indices [31], the sensitivity indices are computed by

RV

where M is the parameter whose sensitivity index is computed.
Table 1 gives a summary of the sensitivity indices of RV evaluated at the baseline parameters values given in Table 2.
From the sensitivity analysis as presented in Table 1, an increase of the rate of vaccination c by 1% leads to a decrease of the effective reproduction RV by 0.89844626%. An increase of the vaccine efficacy  by 1% leads to a decrease in the effective reproductive number RV by 0.9990436%. Clearly, the rate of vaccination and the vaccine efficacy are among the sensitive parameters of RV. An increase in the rate of vaccination, with high vaccine efficacy, leads to a decrease in the vaccine reproduction number. Consequently, control strategies should target an increased rate of vaccination and administration of vaccines of high efficacy levels.

6. Optimal Analysis with Vaccination Program as a Control Intervention
An optimal control problem is constructed to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus and optimize the

To determine the optimum vaccination program for COVID-19, let the variables c and 1  : (1 - ) be the control variables. As a result, an optimal control problem is constructed, with the goal of reducing the number of individuals infected with COVID-19. e following objective function is created to accomplish this:

where S, V, E, I, and R are the adjoint variables. To obtain the expression of optimal controls in order to minimize the number of infections in the population and the cost of control strategies, the following proposition is applied.

Proposition 4. For the optimal control (c, 1) that minimizes J(c, 1), the adjoint variables S, V, E, I, and R satisfy the following ordinary differential equations:

In recent decades, control theory has been widely applied in many fields.

thermore, lowering illness prevalence requires reducing the

rate of vaccination (c) while decreasing the coefficient of

tion rates and the administering of highly efficacious vac-

cines would help maximize control strategies against

COVID-19 transmission dynamics.



7. Numerical Simulation and Discussion
e parameters used for simulation are obtained from literature, and others are estimates, as listed in Table 2. ese parameter values are varied within realistic limits.
For purposes of simulation, unless otherwise stated, the initial populations are taken to be S(0)  3000, V(0)  2000, E(0)  1500, I(0)  1200, and R(0)  1000.
e numerical simulation aims to analyze the change in the state of COVID-19 virus progression over time, as well as the impact of variation in the vaccination rate and vaccine efficacy on COVID-19 transmission dynamics. is is accomplished by varying the parameters  and c while holding the other parameters constant. Simulation analyses of the model (1) are presented in Figures 2 and 3.
Figure 2 shows the effect of variation in vaccine efficacy () on infection dynamics. When the vaccine administered is of high efficacy, say 90% efficacy, it would take less time for the pool of infected individuals to reduce. On the other hand, when the vaccine efficacy is low, it would take a longer time for the number of infected individuals to reduce, and therefore, COVID-19 infection would persist in the population. Figure 3 shows the effect of variation in the vaccination rate (c) on infection dynamics. It is shown that when the rate of vaccination is high, the number of infected individuals decreases sharply and vice versa. Figure 4 shows the graph of the vaccine reproduction number RV against the vaccination rate (c). It is observed that with an increase in the rate of vaccination (c), the vaccine reproduction number decreases sharply. Figure 5 shows the 3D plot of the vaccine reproduction number RV against the rate of vaccination (c)

Vaccination offers a very powerful method of COVID-19 disease control. e critical level of vaccination of above 50% with an > 80% vaccine efficacy level would be required to reduce the severity and eventually eradicate the infection from the population. Herd immunity against COVID-19 can be achieved by immunizing a significant proportion of the

8

susceptible population. To prevent a large outbreak in the future, in addition to vaccination, a variety of other control measures (e.g., COVID-19 protocols such as the use of masks, social distancing, proper hygiene, and so on) are required [14, 36].
8. Conclusion
In this paper, the effect of vaccination as an intervention is investigated through an SVEIR model. e well-posedness of the model and the existence of disease-free equilibrium are shown. Sensitivity analysis here suggests that the rate of vaccination, c, and the vaccine efficacy  are among the most influential parameters of RV. For optimal control, increasing the vaccination rate and administering highly efficacious vaccines would help maximize control strategies against COVID-19 transmission dynamics. is is illustrated by the numerical simulations. is study, like others [19, 37, 38], confirms that vaccination may possibly eradicate the infection in the population. Future research could focus on an age-dependent SVEIR model to determine the suitable vaccination strategy to be applied with respect to age.
