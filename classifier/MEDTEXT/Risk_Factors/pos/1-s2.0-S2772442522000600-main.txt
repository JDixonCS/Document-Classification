ABSTRACT
Emergency Life-Saving Drugs (ELSDs) are among the highest-priority healthcare necessities since they must be administered immediately to save patient lives and prevent complications in the most critical conditions. Due to this reason, it is vital to ensure a continuous and undisrupted supply chain (SC) network for ELSDs throughout the country. However, the SC network of ELSDs is very complex and unpredictable, requiring many stages and processes and involving many parties. The recent COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war have increased these SC disruptions even to a greater extent. Due to the associated complexities and uncertainties, the efficient management of ELSDs SC is usually very challenging. Consequently, proper identification and evaluation of ELSDs SC disruption risks are crucial, of which few studies have concentrated yet, especially from an emerging economy perspective. This study aimed to identify and analyze the most impactful risk factors (RFs) that disrupt the ELSDs SC, particularly in a developing country context, to address this research gap. The study identified 14 key RFs to the ELSDs SC from relevant literature and expert feedback. Then, a combination of the Grey theory and the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method was utilized in this study to assess and prioritize the RFs and show the interrelationships among them. The findings suggested that financial and economic risk, non-availability of critical raw material, an influx of infectious disease, and sudden natural disasters pose the greatest threats to the ELSDs SC. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted afterward to evaluate the robustness of the proposed framework. This research is expected to aid the managers of ELSDs SC in maintaining a continuous and undisrupted availability of these essential medicines to save the lives of millions of patients under critical care.

1. Introduction
Disruption has a significant impact on all parties involved in any SC. SC risks significantly influence business functions by fluctuating supply and demand [1]. It can potentially disrupt the movement of materials from the production facilities to the end users and thus the flow of money. Hence, organizations are now focusing on better understanding and managing SC risk due to the expenses associated with SC disruptions and consequently, many researchers are now focusing on studying SC disruption risk factors (RFs) in many industrial domains. Bangladesh's emergency life-saving drugs (ELSD) industry primarily depends on imported active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) [2], and the country's SC was severely disrupted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the current Russia-Ukraine conflict has made supplying various goods and raw materials to various industries around this region difficult, significantly impacting the global SC network [3]. This SC disruption has contributed to the slowdown of overall drug

production and research and development of newer or improved drugs [4].
Due to the rising frequency of pandemics, wars, and natural and man-made disasters, there has been an enormous increase in interest among practitioners in studies related to SC disruption in recent years [5]. Risk identification is the initial phase of risk management, in which the risk manager identifies the risk occurrences that need to be investigated further [6]. Unfortunately, the sources of the risks are usually hidden until the consequences are felt. These risks can result in serious financial issues and a significant loss of revenue. Since the severity of disruption consequences depends on their early discovery, businesses must use risk identification to precisely identify the sources of SC risks [7]. To help industries better understand the risks and focus on overcoming the resultant disruptions, exploring the causal link between identified risk variables is essential in mitigating those disruptions. Hence, it is vital for the ELSD industry of emerging economy countries like Bangladesh to identify and assess the risks of SC

interruption and take the necessary steps to minimize economic losses and loss of human lives. Since there is no significant research on this context to date, this study, therefore, aims to assess the RFs that may significantly influence the SC performance of ELSD industry. Based on the antecedent discussion, this research tried to answer the following research questions (RQs):
RQ1: What are the most significant factors that disrupt the SC of the ELSD manufacturing industry?
RQ2: How can decision-makers evaluate the cause-and-effect relationships between selected RFs?
This research proposes the following research objectives (ROs) to address the abovementioned RQs to minimize SC disruptions:
RO1: To identify the RFs that cause disruptions in ELSDs SC. RO2: To rank the identified RFs and then explore the causal relationships between the RFs for mitigating disruption in ELSDs SC. To achieve these ROs, the RFs were first identified through structured literature analysis and then validated with the help of subject matter experts. Then, a combination of the Grey theory and the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method was utilized in this study to investigate the ranking and the causal relationships among the RFs. The traditional DEMATEL technique can aid in discovering structural relationships between RFs by analyzing related digraphs; nevertheless, it is susceptible to data ambiguity [8]. The perspective of a real-life event may be skewed owing to uncertainty and bias in human subjective judgment and lack of awareness [9]. Both fuzzy theory and grey theory can overcome such issues and increase the accuracy of the decision-makers judgment [10]; [11]. However, the key benefits of using the grey sets over fuzzy sets are the simplified calculation method and the ability to provide more reliable results [12]. Grey DEMATEL provides significant advantages in the case of analysis of complicated systems compared to other decision-making techniques. For instance, methods like analytic hierarchy process (AHP), best-worst method (BWM), or step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) can rank the factors but cannot evaluate the causal relationships among them. Moreover, method like interpretive structural modeling (ISM) can only assess relationships when one factor directly influences another but cannot examine indirect correlations. In that sense, grey DEMATEL is more effective than ISM, AHP, BWM, or SWARA techniques, as it acknowledges the overall relationships among the factors [13]. To examine the priority or the ranking of the factors, Garg [14] also found grey DEMATEL to be a superior method compared to the other multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches like TOPSIS, VIKOR, AHP, BWM, and so on. Therefore, this study utilizes a grey DEMATEL-based framework to investigate the complex issues that disrupt ELSD SC and the interrelationships among the identified RFs. The remainder of the paper is structured into the following sections: Section 2 provides a systematic literature review in the context of the ELSD sector. Section 3 provides an overview of the study framework and implemented methodology. Section 4 presents the obtained results and a sensitivity analysis, while Section 5 discusses the results and implications of the study. Section 6 concludes the study and discusses some future research scopes.
2. Contextual literature review
The literature review of this study is structured into three subsections: background study of the ELSD sector, related works, research gaps and contributions, and major RFs to the ELSD SC.
2.1. Background of the ELSD sector
Unpredictable catastrophes, such as natural disasters, pandemics, or terrorist acts, can disrupt SCs and have disastrous consequences for any manufacturing industry [15]. A vast network of participants

inside and outside the drug industry makes up the SC [16]. SC disruptions can cause severe delivery delays and shortages of products and goods [17]. Life-Saving Emergency Drugs are those that save lives in moments of emergency. Some instances in which ELSDs are required include -- drug overdose, severe bleeding, substance abuse, myocardial infarction, severe angina attack, respiratory failure, anaphylactic shock, status epilepticus, peripheral respiratory collapse, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, pain relief in emergency rescue situations, acute asthmatic attack, anti-snake venom injection, tetanus toxoid injection and so on [18]. Some of the ELSDs and their usage [19] are shown in Fig. 1.
In Bangladesh, ELSD industry is one of the most significant sources of foreign currency since Bangladesh not only produces ELSD for itself but exports a substantial amount to many developed nations, including the USA, Canada, and other various European countries [20]. Local companies supply over 98% of the country's requirement for pharmaceutical goods, with only 2% of those items coming from overseas markets [21]. However, Bangladesh is highly reliant on other foreign countries like China, India, and Russia to import various chemicals and other necessary raw materials for this sector [22]. Due to this reliance, a dynamic and efficient SC between the supplier and the end customer is required to avoid any disruption. However, pandemics, natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, hurricanes, or other geological phenomena, as well as man-made calamities like terrorism, political instability, and other disasters, can have a significant impact on the raw material import, production, and transportation of ELSDs to the end users. These may increase the price of both raw materials and ELSDs. Some studies performed in the related field are presented in Table 1.
2.2. Research gap and study contribution
Healthcare organizations are increasingly touched by various external factors over which they have little control. Table 1 demonstrates that academics and practitioners have sought to assess the risk associated with the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry. Interestingly, all of the previous studies were conducted focusing on either vaccine distribution or the pharmaceutical sector in general, and none concentrated on ELSD SC. The fact that ELSDs help save lives on an emergency basis and disruption of their SC can cause an increase in the emergency room's mortality rate makes it a very important healthcarerelated sector that needs to be explored extensively. However, to date, there has been no strategic analysis of the risk variables affecting the disruption of the ELSD SC in any emerging economy country.
Numerous studies have investigated SC RFs in various industrial sectors. For instance, Queiroz et al. [32] conducted a simulation experiment to see how the COVID-19 outbreak might affect SC performance and found that the pandemic epidemic affects companies' supply, demand, and logistics infrastructures, resulting in severe SC instability. Ishola et al. [33] identified and assessed critical disruption risks of a petroleum refinery process unit using a robust fuzzy linguistic assessment methodology. Moreover, Paul et al. [34] studied transportation disruption risk in the pharmaceutical sector using the Bayesian Belief Network (BNN) approach. Simchi-Levi et al. [35] identified risks and mitigating disruptions in the automotive SC. Zhao et al. [36] analyzed the risk of agri-food SC using total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) and Fuzzy MICMAC. Pareto assessment and the best-worst method (BWM) were utilized by Moktadir et al. [37] to evaluate the RFs in sustainable SC operations in the leather sector. However, no research has yet examined the RFs for the SC disruption of the ELSDs sector. The proposed study aimed to address this research gap by identifying the ELSD SC RFs and exploring the interrelationship among the identified RFs. Hence, the study contributes to the existing literature in the following ways:
i. Determining the most relevant RFs affecting the ELSD SC of a developing economy like Bangladesh.

2.3. Identification of the RFs that disrupt ELSDs SC
A systematic literature review was conducted to extract the RFs disrupting the ELSD SC. Natural calamities have been identified by Shekarian et al. [38] as one of the RFs to disrupt the whole SC. Again, Bavarsad et al. [39] pointed out that political instability has hindered the SC badly. In addition, most companies in developing countries

have faced SC disruption due to transportation and bullwhip risks [40]. Disruption may occur due to quality and lead time variation risks in various cases [41]. Moktadir et al. [31] identified that Financial Risk and non-availability of critical raw materials significantly impact the SC and often cause disruption along with a lot of waste. Improper forecasting has been considered another RF to SC disruption by Shekarian et al. [38]. Previous studies have also identified information delay and capacity risk as important RFs causing SC disruption [39]. The RFs have been searched among previous literature available in Google Scholar and Scopus databases by using key terms like ``factors affecting the supply chain of pharmaceuticals industry'', OR 11factors that are disrupting drugs supply chain'', OR ``key supply chain RFs'', AND ``factors disrupting supply chains in emerging economies'' and so on. The literature search timeline ranged from 2014 to 2022. The initial list of RFs to disrupt the ELSD SC extracted from prior relevant literature is presented in Appendix A of the supplementary materials, which were later sent to the experts for validation.

3. Research methodology
3.1. Validation of the RFs and data collection
In this study, expert feedback was collected in two phases. After the initial identification of the RFs (see Appendix A of the supplementary materials), they were sent to the participating experts for validation of their relevance to the context examined. For this purpose, this research gathered responses from 14 experts. A purposive or judgmental sampling technique was used to choose the experts in this study [42,43]. In contrast to other forms of convenience sampling, purposeful sampling necessitates an expert's assessment of the sample's suitability and a persuasive case for which a particular set of respondents provides an adequate basis for survey-experimental inferences [10,44]. This method allows researchers to get qualitative expert opinions that may help them achieve their study's goal [45]. Fig. 2 shows the framework utilized in this research.
In the initial feedback collection stage, the experts removed four RFs ('higher freight costs', 'strategy exposure risk', 'competition risk from market', and 'variation in exchange rate'). They added three more RFs ('an influx of infectious disease', 'human resource-related risk', and 'unwanted hazards in production plant'). Thus, 14 SC disruption RFs (RFs) were determined finally based on literature resources and expert

feedback, as shown in Table 2. A brief explanation of these RFs is presented in Table B1 in Appendix B of the supplementary materials.
Experts' feedback was collected again later for the analysis using Grey DEMATEL. A 4-point Likert scale was used in the second phase of feedback collection. The experts were requested to give their judgments or priority weights on the RFs utilizing a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 indicated no influence and 4 indicated very highly influential. They identified the cause group (most influential) and effect group (least influential) from the final list of RFs provided to them (see Table 2). Then, comparison vectors were developed from expert feedback.
Experts' identities have not been revealed to maintain their confidentiality. The respondents were all involved in the pharmaceutical and drug-related industries professionally. Having in-depth knowledge of ELSDs, practical expertise in the SC, and at least seven years of experience in the relevant industrial sector were some of the inclusion criteria for selecting the experts. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we collected expert feedback online using Google forms from June 2021 to August 2022 (See Appendix A of the supplementary materials). For RFs validation, the response rate was 51.17% (12 out of 23), and for Grey DEMATEL analysis, the response rate was 43.48% (10 out of 23 (43.48%), respectively. Table 3 provides a summary of the participating respondents.

3.2. Grey-based DEMATEL approach
DEMATEL is a decision-making method that uses a causal diagram to identify the interrelationships among factors [47]. The findings obtained from DEMATEL can aid managers in understanding both the priority and the degree of influence of various factors on a particular system [48]. In real-life situations, unforeseen circumstances might lead to erroneous human judgments or incomplete information. The traditional DEMATEL technique cannot deal with these uncertainties [9]. However, with fewer samples, the grey set theory can handle unclear patterns under insufficient data, inherent ambiguity in human assessment, and unconscious biases [13,49]. To integrate the benefits from both approaches, a grey theory based DEMATEL method has been utilized in this study to obtain a comprehensive insight into the RFs that disrupt the ELSD SC, which simpler MCDM techniques might not have

been able to address appropriately. Many academics have successfully used this approach to investigate the interaction among various distinct elements in various areas of application, as shown in Table 4.
The steps of Grey DEMATEL utilized in this research have been adopted following the works of Raj and Sah [54] and Liu et al. [13], which are as follows
(a) Development of direct relation matrix: First, create an initial direct relation matrix for all experts, where ``'' represents the number of SC disruption risk variables and ``'' indicates the number of respondents selected for the research. Each respondent is tasked with evaluating the direct influence of factor  over facilitator  on an integer scale ranging from 0 to 4, representing ``no influence'' to ``very high influence'' among ``n'' identified facilitators, respectively.

(i) Developing causal relationship digraph: The diagram is plotted by setting the threshold value from the total relation matrix T. The total-relation matrix (T ) provides information on how one risk factor influences another. To avoid comparably negligible effects, experts, analysts, or evaluators need to set a threshold value (). If  > , then risk factor i influences or causes risk factor j, a directed arrow is incorporated into the analysis. A digraph showing causal relations can be plotted from the data set:

4. Results

With the usage of the Grey DEMATEL technique, the influence ranking of the RFs for the SC disruption in the ELSDs industry was identified, as shown in Table 6. The relative weights (RWs) of the RFs have been determined to make the prioritization of the prominent RFs more apparent. The total of RWs is 1.000. The ranking of RFs based on influence level (R+C) is as A6 > A7 > A5 > A1 > A3 > A8 > A12 > A10 > A2 > A9 > A4 > A11 > A13 > A14.
The ranking of RFs as cause and effect groups is presented in Table 7. Nine RFs were found as causal factors (with R-C > 0) and five as effect factors (with R-C < 0). The RFs in the cause group are sequenced as A1 > A5 > A12 > A2 > A9 > A3 > A8 > A4 > A6, where the RFs in the effect group are sequenced as A11 > A14 > A10 > A13 > A7.
A causal diagram is produced, shown in Fig. 3, utilizing Tables 6 and 7. The schematic diagram was developed in the Cartesian Coordinate System, with R-C along the  -axis and R+C along the -axis. The RFs are categorized into four clusters, which are denoted as the driving RFs cluster (C1), independent RFs cluster (C2), critical RFs cluster (C3), and impact RFs cluster (C4). Among them, the driving RFs (C1) and critical RFs (C3) lie in the cause group, whereas independent RFs (C2)

and impact RFs (C4) lie in the effect group. C3 exhibits the highest influencing RFs owing to its location in the cause group and high influence zone. To alleviate the disruption of the SC of the ELSDs industry, legislators must contribute the utmost emphasis to these RFs. On the contrary, C4 appears to be the most influential RF cluster located in the effect group.
The correlations among the RFs are depicted in Fig. 4. There is a total of 14 × 14 relationships possible. Because drawing all the connections proved difficult, we set the threshold value () to create the digraph, where () equals the sum of the mean () and standard deviation value () of the total relation matrix (T). Thereby, the obtained threshold value in this study,  = 0.0813 + 0.0434 = 0.1247.
4.1. Sensitivity analysis
The initial calculation was performed by giving each expert equal weight. But each responder has their area of expertise, which generates bias-induced uncertainty. To increase the results' credibility, we must ensure that the little existing ambiguity is not influencing the final calculations to a great extent. Consequently, a sensitivity analysis is conducted. The possible uncertainty is dispersed by adjusting the weights of the assessors in the sensitivity analysis. Three sensitivity tests examine a collection of unequally distributed weights (uncertainties) of the evaluators. Weights assigned to the expert for all three sensitivity analyses are presented in Table 8.
The findings of the sensitivity analysis are shown in Figs. 5-7 and Table 9, respectively.
Although in Figs. 5-7 and Table 9, we notice slight variations in the values of prominence and causal importance in the cause group (R-D>

0), their order within the group was consistent for both prominence and causal importance across all scenarios in the sensitivity test. While analyzing the effect group RFs, minor shifts in their relative orders were observed. Fig. 8 presents the minor variations in three scenarios comparing the base scenario, which establishes the robustness of the result obtained from this study.
5. Discussions
Table 6 shows that `financial and economic risk (A6)' has the most substantial significance and influence on other RFs and is a crucial contributor to the disruption of the ELSD SC, since money is a crucial need for the smooth operation of any SC and many other RFs are often cost-driven. SC's susceptibility to financial risks has become more conspicuous since the 2007 global financial and economic catastrophe [55]. Therefore, to reduce disruptions, organizations should focus on

minimizing all risks associated with finance. The 2nd most important and impactful RF to disrupt the SC for ELSDs is discovered to be the `non-availability of critical raw materials (A7). This refers to the nonavailability of the required material at the required time despite the order being placed on time and the delivery date, amount, and cost being agreed upon with the supplier well in advance [56]. The failure of a specific supplier to provide ELSD manufacturing industry with critical raw materials on scheduled time may obstruct the company from meeting customer demand or put the lives and safety of the endusers in danger. Building inventories or using several sources may help businesses avoid running out of essential raw materials.
The 3rd most crucial RF is the recent `influx of infectious diseases (A5)'. The outbreak of infectious diseases such as Covid-19, MERS, SARS, Swine flu, Ebola, etc. constitute a significant concern and can severely disrupt the ELSD SC. Due to the high frequency of disease outbreaks, emergency medical services in many communities

are already overburdened, underfunded, and understaffed. As a result of this increased demand for services, most notably, the healthcare SC is disrupted. The inability to properly manage such calamitous situations causes severe supply chain disruptions and service quality disruptions, resulting in the loss of human lives [57]. To prevent the interruption of ELSD SC in this instance, prior preparedness for the pandemic and demand management is necessary. Therefore, the company must give this RF the proper amount of attention. The 4th most significant RF is the `transportation and other logistics risk (A3)'. ELSD supply chain disruption may occur due to any disturbance in the transportation network, which can influence the whole chain and result in serious issues, including suspended operations, lost revenues, delayed deliveries, and reputational damage [34]. The government and businesses must take the necessary precautions to minimize such interruptions. `Sudden natural disasters (A1)' is the 5th most influential RF. It suggests that when disasters hit any area with high intensity, it usually restricts information flow, causes loss of utilities, poor resource

availability, damaged equipment, fuel and labor shortages, increased levels of market volatility, and have other adverse effects on supply chains [58]. Even though the demand for ELSDs during a natural disaster is unpredictable, industry and healthcare services need to be prepared before disaster strikes to prevent such disruptions.
In the causal group, as shown in Fig. 3 and Table 7, `sudden natural disasters (A1)' appeared to exhibit the most significant impact and influence on other RFs among these causal factors. Natural disasters like hurricanes, tsunamis, or blizzards always cause SC disruptions by closing ports, canceling cargo flights, and delaying or halting deliveries. They may also cause supply and demand imbalances, leading to SC disruptions. Since the company has less control over natural disasters compared to other RFs in the SC, managers should better plan to deal with the devastating impact of natural disasters [59]. `An influx of infectious disease (A5)' is identified as the 2nd causal RF. The influx of infectious illness has included considerable disruptions in the planning and utilization of routine services, including essential health services

[57]. The 3rd most influential causal RF is the `unwanted hazards in production plants (A12)'. Unwanted hazards in the production plant include chemical, ergonomic, physical, and psychosocial hazards that obstruct SC and temporarily halt production. Hazardous incidents may disrupt business operations and harm the supply chain system by causing delays, financial losses, and damage to the company's reputation [60]. The 4th and 5th ranked RFs in the cause group are `political instability (A2)' and `information delay (A9)', respectively. `Political instability (A2)' in any region of the globe can severely impact SCs' operational performance [61]. `Information delay (A9)' pauses the flow of information and increases internal uncertainty that may lead to supply chain disruptions [46]. The 6th and 7th RFs of causal group are `transportation and other logistics risk (A3)' and `forecasting errors (A8)'. Transportation delays may result in the depletion of downstream supplies and a decrease in consumer demand [62]. Besides, the most sensitive risks in supply networks are those related to forecasting

mistakes, as forecast accuracy and reliability impact every stage of the supply chain, from the retailer to the raw materials supplier, often resulting in a bullwhip effect [63].
Based on the analysis provided in Fig. 3 and Table 7, the effect RFs can be sorted as follows: A11> A14 > A10 > A13 >A7. These five RFs are usually directly influenced by the nine cause group RFs. RFs like `human resource-related risk (A11)', `capacity planning risk (A14)', and `risk from bullwhip effect (A10)' are relatively less influenced but are also vital as they lie close to the cause group. However, they are still impacted by the cause group RFs. Factors like `financial and economic risk (A6)' often impact the risk associated with human resources (A11). The accessibility of properly trained human resources again can positively impact the efficiency of the SC performance and logistics operations [64]. RF like `capacity planning risk (A14)' is often impacted by RFs like `sudden natural disasters (A1)' and `an influx of infectious disease (A5)'. Variations in the available SC capacity can

also influence SC performance [65]. Again, `risk from bullwhip effect (A10)' refers to a situation in the supply chain system where a minor change in end-customer demand causes a substantial change in the orders that the upstream suppliers obtain. This phenomenon has a very severe impact on the efficiency of the supply chain [66]. This RF is often impacted by cause group RFs like `forecasting errors (A8)' and `Information delay (A9)'. `Lead time variation risks (A13)' and the `nonavailability of critical raw material (A7)' are the effect group RFs that are also severely impacted by various cause group RFs.
Fig. 4 of this study shows that `an influx of infectious disease (A5)' has the strongest correlation with the other recognized RFs. As a result, the supply stability of ELSDs is highly dependent on newly emerging infectious diseases. Moreover, 'sudden natural disasters (A1)' and 'financial and economic risk (B2)' are also strongly correlated with other RFs. Natural disasters significantly impact the ELSD SC, including operational management and distribution network failure. Moreover, SC is subject to many financial risks that control the flow of money, which in turn, impacts the flow of materials through the SC.
While performing the sensitivity analysis, when a specific expert's weight is changed, the weights of the remaining experts are left unchanged to demonstrate the total impact of the change on the system [67]. Figs. 5 to 7 implies three different scenarios of changing the weights in that way. Finally, Fig. 8 illustrates that, with minor variations, the patterns of all the RFs are identical across all the cases. It suggests that the results obtained from this study are robust and, thereby, reliable. Again, Table 10 presents a comparison among the RF ranking obtained from this study (which uses the grey DEMATEL method) with two other popular factor ranking methods, namely SWARA and BWM. Table 10 shows that the rankings from SWARA and BWM are pretty close to the ranking obtained from the grey DEMATEL method, which validates the proposed framework's ranking. However, since the processes used to get the factor weights in SWARA or BWM are not the same as grey DEMATEL, a slight variation among the rankings is observed, even though the same group of experts participated for all three methods (grey DEMATEL, SWARA, and BWM). The actual factor weights obtained from SWARA and BWM are provided in Table C5 of Appendix C in the supplementary materials.
The outcomes from this study are notably different from the other relevant studies that have examined the RFs of SC disruption in other sectors or countries or employed other techniques. For example, Moktadir et al. [37] utilized the Pareto analysis and Best-Worst method to examine the RFs for sustainable SC in the leather industry. They found changing customer preferences, ineffective effluent treatment, and incorrect solid waste disposal to be the three most essential RFs. Again, Sakib et al. [68] assessed the oil and gas SC disruptions using a Bayesian Network model and determined that the technical challenges were the most significant. Moreover, Raian et al. [69] incorporated the fuzzy synthetic analysis technique and revealed that the ineffective

product transportation system was the most critical RF in the textile industry SC. In contrast to the abovementioned studies, this study found that the most crucial RFs to SC disruption are financial and economic risk, non-availability of critical raw material, an influx of infectious disease, and sudden natural disasters. Moreover, since no research has yet focused on the ranking and demonstrating correlations of the RFs of SC disruption in the ELSD-producing industry, particularly in any country with an emerging economy, the study is particularly unique in the context examined.
5.1. Theoretical implications
The research has several theoretical contributions to the ELSDs sector, including:
· Identifying the most significant RFs disrupting the ELSD SC. This study can be used later to identify and investigate the risks in other industries and different economic perspectives.
· Exploring the most pertinent RFs for SC disruption in the ELSD industry.
· Providing a validated grey theory-based DEMATEL framework to assess the RFs and present the causal correlations among the RFs. The amount of uncertainty in human decision-making can be reduced using the proposed grey theory-based approach.
· Enabling the decision-makers of other ELSDs related industries to minimize the SC disruption by examining the most crucial RFs and their cause-effect linkages.
This research not only closes the gaps in the relevant literature but also paves the way for future practitioners to explore this area further with other decision-making tools to validate the study further and extend this study to several different directions.
5.2. Practical implications
The findings of this paper have several practical implications for businesses, academics, and practitioners involved in the SC of ELSD sector. Since ELSDs are the most basic human necessity during the extremely vulnerable moments in the emergency rooms of healthcare facilities, the findings of this article can give a basic idea about how to design a newly discovered ELSDs' SC to minimize future disruptions. This study aims to increase awareness about the evaluated RFs among individuals who want to or are now working on improving the ELSDs SC. Proactive planning and appropriate preparations can help attain a better achievement level. A manager tasked with preventing disruptions in the ELSDs SC must make extensive efforts to limit the losses caused by natural disasters, erroneous capacity planning, and forecasting errors. These risks should be considered in the very early stage of production planning, and necessary safety measures should be taken to mitigate these risks. These factors are mostly correlated with

11

Healthcare Analytics 2 (2022) 100120

other RFs. For instance, natural disasters significantly influence other RFs and often increase their intensity. It impairs transportation systems, resulting in the non-availability of necessary raw materials. Some RFs seem to be more fundamental than others. Addressing the most influential RFs are more critical, especially if the managers working in the ELSD sector are underfunded. Addressing the most influential RFs often mitigates many other RFs in the effect group at an early stage. Finally, this study is significant for organizations and academics interested in the ELSDs SC since it has the potential to help healthcare practitioners discover weak spots in their internal SC facilities and amend them early to prevent further losses of lives.
6. Conclusions
ELSDs are usually administered very quickly after or during a medical emergency. As a strategic product, the availability of these life-saving medications is an important priority for every healthcare system. Multiple risks affect various parts of the ELSDs SC. Due to the critical nature of ELSD SC, it is vital to analyze the associated risks and take proactive measures to mitigate them. This research is one of the first contributions to the literature on identifying and assessing the SC disruption risks in the ELSD industry of an emerging economy like Bangladesh. We applied a Grey theory-based DEMATEL framework to evaluate the RFs since it allows us to get acceptable results despite the ambiguity and errors in human judgment. This analysis reveals that `financial and economic risk (A6)', `non-Availability of critical raw material (A7)', `an influx of infectious disease (A5)', and `sudden natural disaster (A1)' are the top four most crucial RFs responsible for disrupting the ELSDs SC. Again, enhancing the performance of ELSD's SC demands substantial administrative attention, to which the top management of the relevant sectors should pay more attention too. The results obtained from this research were later communicated and validated by the experts, SC managers in the healthcare industries and academia to ensure its proper applicability. The study findings might assist other developing nations in analyzing the potential risks in their ELSD SC to overcome their vulnerabilities and improve overall operational resilience.
The study has some limitations that can be overcome in future research attempts. Even though the grey-based DEMATEL is a highly effective tool for analyzing the contextual relationships between RFs in an uncertain environment, this system relies heavily on expert feedback. Therefore, it is advisable that the feedback from the experts should be gathered with more caution. Again, a larger number of experts should be engaged in future research to reduce the possibility of opinion bias in the obtained results. Moreover, this study only examined fourteen RFs for the SC disruption, which is not an exhaustive list. In the future, more significant RFs can be explored and included into the existing framework. Future researchers can also utilize this framework to analyze SC disruptions in other sectors, such as the construction, manufacturing, chemical, and service industries of different country perspectives.
