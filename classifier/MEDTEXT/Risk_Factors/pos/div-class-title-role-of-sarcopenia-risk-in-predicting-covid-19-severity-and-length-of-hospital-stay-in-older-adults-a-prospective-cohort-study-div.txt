Abstract
Sarcopenia is more common in the elderly and causes adverse outcomes with increased morbidity and mortality. This prospective cohort study assessed the association of sarcopenia risk with the severity of COVID-19 at the time of admission and during hospitalisation and the length of hospital stay. Two hundred patients (aged  60 y) who were hospitalised for COVID19 were enrolled using consecutive sampling between December 29th 2020 and May 20th 2021. The sarcopenia score of the patients was assessed using the Strength, Assistance in walking, Rising from a chair, Climbing stairs, and Falls (SARC-F) questionnaire. The severity of COVID19 was determined using the modified National Early Warning Score (m-NEWS) system for 2019 n-CoV infected patients at admission (T1), day three (T2), and at discharge (T3). Data were analysed using SPSS, version 22 and STATA, version 14. Of the 165 patients included, 34 (20.6 %) were at risk of sarcopenia. The length of hospital stay was slightly longer in patients with sarcopenia risk, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.600). The adjusted odds ratio of respiratory rate (RR) > 20 /min at T1 for the sarcopenia risk group was 6.7-times higher than that for the non-sarcopenic group (P = 0.002). According to Generalized Estimating Equations, after adjusting for confounding factors, the m-NEWS score was 5.6 units higher in patients at risk of sarcopenia (P < 0.001). Sarcopenia risk could exacerbate COVID-19 severity and increase RR at admission, as well as the need for oxygen therapy at discharge.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a public health emergency since March 2020(1). This severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 480 million individuals and caused more than 6 million deaths worldwide(2). The common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, headache, diarrhoea, anorexia, and loss of taste and smell, as well as respiratory symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. Moreover, interstitial pneumonia may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome with subsequent sepsis-induced coagulopathy and multiple organ dysfunction(3, 4). Adherence to safety measures and strengthening the immune system are important approaches for protecting individuals against COVID-19 until approved pharmacological therapies and vaccines become globally available(3, 5).
The overall prevalence and number of severe cases of COVID-19 are higher among older individuals(6). Factors such as sarcopenia, chronic diseases, and nutritional inadequacy, which are more prevalent in older adults, can adversely affect the immune system and physiological function(6-8).
Particularly, sarcopenia is a progressive, generalized skeletal muscle disorder defined by the loss of muscle mass, physical performance, and strength(9, 10). Risk factors for this disorder include aging, nutritional deficiency, chronic diseases, physical inactivity, anxiety, and very low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels(11). The prevalence of sarcopenia in the elderly ranges from 9.9 to 40.4 %, according to a systematic review(12). This prevalence's range depend on factors such as the reference used for its definition, age, gender and ethnicity(11, 13). Specifically, different definitions of sarcopenia do not necessarily measure the same underlying variables; thus, even within the same population, sarcopenia estimation can vary depending on the definition(14). In addition, sarcopenia is more prevalent among non-Asian individuals(15), men older than 80 years, and women younger than 70 years(16).
Nutritional status, sarcopenia, and the immune system are strongly related to each other. Nutritional deficiency exacerbates sarcopenia and as a result will weaken the immune system(17). In COVID-19 patients, sarcopenia can cause deterioration of respiratory system function by weakening the muscles involved in respiration. Moreover, it can increase the risk of aspiration because of its negative impact on the muscles involved in swallowing(11, 18). On the other hand, a

combination of obesity and sarcopenia can result in a state called sarcopenic obesity, in which there is a reduction in muscle mass in addition to an elevation in fat mass(19). Studies have shown that the prevalence of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress is higher in sarcopenic obesity than in sarcopenia alone and can result in the deterioration of immune system function(20).
Information about the sarcopenia effect on the severity of COVID-19 is rare and controversial. In a previous study on hospitalised COVID-19 patients, with a median age of 62 years, sarcopenia was associated with a longer hospital stay. The authors assessed the severity of the disease using the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) system at baseline and found a significant difference between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic groups(21). The NEWS2 is a system for scoring the physiological measurements that enable the early detection of clinical deterioration(22). However, another study reported no significant difference between patients with low and normal skeletal muscle index in terms of mortality, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and the NEWS2 at baseline (median age, 51 years)(23).
It is clear that prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of sarcopenia are important for the management of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory diseases(18). Therefore, the present study assessed the potential effect of sarcopenia risk on the severity of COVID-19 at admission and during hospitalisation in a large sample of older patients.
Materials and methods
Study population
This prospective cohort study was performed at the Nikan Hospital in Tehran, Iran, which is a referral centre for COVID-19. All subjects were patients aged 60 years or older, admitted to the hospital between December 29th 2020 and May 20th 2021, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. The COVID-19 test used was real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples. Those who had a history of hepatic and end-stage renal disease, as well those undergoing dialysis were not included. The participants were enrolled using consecutive sampling.
Sample size calculation was performed according to Fleiss' odds-based sample size calculation method(24). Ratio (unexposed/exposed), percent outcome in unexposed group, and

odds ratio were used. Based on the results of Yao Ma et al.(25), who reported that among their initial population of 114 patients, 26 out of 38 subjects with risk of sarcopenia and 17 out of 76 patients without risk of sarcopenia (according to SARF-C), were diagnosed with severe COVID19, the current study obtained a population of 164 patients to reach the two-sided confidence level of 95 % at a power of 90 %. Because of the high likelihood of dropouts from this study of elderly patients with COVID-19, we considered a 20 % dropout rate and obtained 200 initial participants. The Epi InfoTM, version 7.2.5.0 (STATCALC), was used to calculate the sample size. Sarcopenia screening
For all subjects, the SARC-F questionnaire was used for screening sarcopenia (online supplementary Table. S1)(26). This questionnaire contains five questions that evaluate risk of sarcopenia. Out of a total possible score of 10, a score  4 indicates a risk of sarcopenia(27). Because COVID-19 safety precautions encourage decreased contact between patients and researchers, we did not complete the SARC-F questionnaire during hospital stay. After discharge, the subjects were contacted and the SARC-F questionnaire was completed. The participants were asked to complete questionnaire based on their pre-COVID-19 condition.
Baseline characteristics
The baseline demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory results, which were recorded during the first 24 h after admission, were extracted from the patients' electronic records in accordance with pandemic health protocols and to minimize physical contact with patients. Demographic characteristics encompassed age, sex, marital status, and education. Comorbidities included diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, respiratory disease, cancer, and chronic digestive problems, which result in a decrease of nutrient intake or absorption, as well as surgeries that may cause weight reduction and the use of immunosuppressants.
The blood chemistry reported: white blood cells (WBC), lymphocytes, neutrophils, platelets (PLT), and red blood cells (RBC) counts, as well as the haemoglobin concentration (Hb), prothrombin time (PT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and ferritin levels. Fasting blood samples (5 cc) were collected from the anterior arm veins of the patients, centrifuged, and

their serum samples were isolated. Complete blood count (CBC) was performed using a cell counter (Nihdon Kohden Celltac E; Japan). PT was estimated by coagulation method (clot) using the appropriate kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific; USA). Serum levels of AST and ALT were determined using the appropriate kit with International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC/UV) method (Ziest Chem; Iran). Serum level of ALP was determined using the appropriate kit with color spectrometric spectrophotometry method (Pars Lab; Iran). Serum CPK activity was detected using an auto-analyser (Biorex fars; Iran). Serum ferritin levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a human ferritin enzyme immunoassay test kit (Immunobiological Laboratories; Germany).
Anthropometric assessments
A trained nutritionist measured weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) of all participants at the time of admission. If the patient was able to stand, the weight was measured using a Seca digital scale (model 813) with an accuracy of 100 g (bearing capacity of up to 200 kg). The participants were barefoot and wore the least possible clothing when weighed. The standing height without shoes was assessed using a tape measure mounted on the wall with a precision of 0.1 cm. The weights of patients who were unable to stand (n = 10), were estimated using the mid-arm circumference (MAC) as: Weight (kg) = 4 × [MAC (cm)] - 50(28). For individuals with spinal deformation (n = 5), the knee height (KH) was used to estimate height. For males, this was predicted as: Height (cm) = 62.913 + [2.077 × KH (cm)] and for females, it was predicted as: Height (cm) = 76.362 + [1.76 × KH(cm)](29). BMI was calculated as: weight (kg) / height2 (m2).
Malnutrition screening
Nutrition risk screening 2002 (NRS-2002) was used to screen for malnutrition(30). This screening tool has two steps. The initial step consists of four yes/no questions. If the subjects answered yes to any of the questions in the primary step, they moved to the second step. A score of  3 out of the maximum of 7 points indicated that the subject was nutritionally at risk(31). This screening was completed at the time of admission.
COVID-19 clinical presentation
COVID-19 severity was determined with the modified National Early Warning Score system for 2019 n-CoV infected patients (m-NEWS)(32) (online supplementary Table. S2). Clinical

presentation of COVID-19 signs, including systolic blood pressure (SBP; mmHg), respiratory rate (RR; per min), pulse rate (PR; per min), body temperature (T; °C), consciousness, oxygen saturation (%), and O2 therapy requirement were measured at three times: at admission (T1), three days after admission (T2), and at discharge (T3). The length of hospital stay, COVID-19 symptoms at admission (cough, dyspnoea, fever, digestive disorders, anorexia, and headache), and presence of pulmonary involvement as determined by lung computed tomography (CT) were recorded. Chest CT was obtained within 24 h of admission.
Ethical approval and patient consents
The study protocol was approved by the Research and Technology Deputy of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (research number: 25392) and the Ethics Committee of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (ethics code: IR.SBMU.NNFTRI.REC.1399.060) on December 27th 2020. Before data collection, implementation methods and study objectives were explained to the patients and all participants signed informed consent forms.
Statistical analysis
All data collected were analysed using Statistical Package Software for Social Science, version 22 (SPSS; USA) and STATA, version 14. Data distribution normality was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Quantitative variables were described as mean and standard deviation (SD). Qualitative variables were described as percentages. Participants at risk of sarcopenia were compared with non-sarcopenic participants using independent samples t-test for quantitative variables and Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for qualitative variables with a continuity correction for 2 × 2 tables.
Binary logistic regression was used to associate having a SBP  130 mmHg, a RR > 20 /min(33), a PR > 100 /min(34), a body temperature  38 °C, a O2 saturation < 94 %(35), and the need for oxygen therapy, with the presence or absence of sarcopenia. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to evaluate changes in the m-NEWS score in the risk of sarcopenia and nonsarcopenic groups. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) was used to determine the multiplicity of these changes between sarcopenia and the m-NEWS score at different times after controlling for the effect of confounding variables (P < 0.200 in the univariate test). GEE was

calculated using STATA software. Two-tailed tests were performed, and statistical significance was set at P < 0.050.
Results
Of the 200 eligible older people originally included in our study, five participants required haemodialysis due to COVID-19 complications, 23 participants did not cooperate in filling out the SARC-F questionnaire, and seven patients died. Thus, the results were obtained from the remaining 165 participants with COVID-19 (Fig. 1). The mean (SD) age of 165 participants was 69.0 (SD 7.6) years (median: 68; minimum (min): 60; maximum (max): 95). The mean (SD) weight and BMI of participants were 79.0 (SD 13.8) kg and 27.9 (SD 4.6) kg/m2, respectively.
Using the SARC-F, 131 participants (79.4 %) were non-sarcopenic and 34 participants (20.6 %) were at risk of sarcopenia. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of at risk of sarcopenia compared to non-sarcopenic participants. The sarcopenia risk group was significantly older than the non-sarcopenic group (75.1 (SD 9.0) vs. 67.5 (SD 6.4) years, P < 0.001), and had a greater proportion of females (23 (67.6 %) vs. 50 (38.2 %) in the non-sarcopenic group, P = 0.002). Also, it was found that 70.6 % of participants who were at risk of sarcopenia had chronic digestive problems (chronic nausea, vomiting, chewing disorders such as needing dentures, dysphagia, peptic ulcer, bloating, constipation, and diarrhoea), while 48.1 % of the nonsarcopenic group had such conditions (P = 0.019). No statistically significant differences were observed between groups in terms of malnutrition, BMI, or other demographic values and past medical history characteristics.
Baseline characteristics also include the results of the laboratory tests performed within 24 h of admission are presented in Table 1. The mean WBC count and PLT in the sarcopenia risk group were significantly higher than in the non-sarcopenic group (WBC count: 8.0 (SD 3.5) vs. 6.6 (SD 3.1) µL/103, P = 0.022; PLT: 245.3 (SD 113.2) vs. 207.4 (SD 82.8) µL/103, P = 0.032), whereas the mean Hb concentration in the sarcopenia risk group was significantly lower than in the non-sarcopenic group (12.3 (SD 1.4) vs. 12.9 (SD 1.6) g/dL, P = 0.027). As well, the mean serum ferritin was lower in the sarcopenia risk group (374.5 (SD 309.8) vs. 584.7 (SD 429.4) ng/mL, P = 0.005). No statistically significant differences were observed between groups for the other studied blood tests.

Table 2 shows COVID-19 clinical presentation of the participants. Before adjusting for confounding factors at the three studied time points, all COVID-19 participants at risk of sarcopenia required oxygen therapy at T1 (P = 0.025). Approximately, 61.8 % of the participants at risk of sarcopenia and 38.9 % of the non-sarcopenic group required oxygen therapy at T3 (P = 0.004). Also, the mean RR at T1 in the sarcopenia risk group was significantly higher than in the non-sarcopenic group (20.4 (SD 3.1) vs. 19.1 (SD 2.3) /min, P = 0.034). However, no statistically significant differences were observed between groups in terms of length of hospital stay. As shown in online supplementary Table. S3, two-way repeated measure ANOVA for the vital signs revealed that participants in both groups had significant decreasing trends from T1 to T3.
Table 3 shows COVID-19 symptoms in participants including cough, dyspnoea, fever, digestive disorders, anorexia, and headache at admission. No significant differences were found between groups for typical COVID-19 symptoms.
We further assessed the association between vital signs, oxygen therapy, and oxygen saturation with sarcopenia risk. For this purpose, we compared the odds ratio of SBP  130 mmHg, RR > 20 /min, PR > 100 /min, body temperature  38 °C, O2 saturation < 94 %, and the need for oxygen therapy for the sarcopenia risk and non-sarcopenic groups adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities (Table 4). The adjusted odds ratio of RR > 20 /min at T1 for the sarcopenia risk group was 6.7-times higher than for the non-sarcopenia group (95 % CI 2.1, 22.0, P = 0.002). The odds ratio of the need for oxygen therapy at T3 was 5.1-times higher in participants at risk of sarcopenia than in the non-sarcopenic group (95 % CI 1.7, 15.4, P = 0.004).
Finally, the m-NEWS score was assessed according to sarcopenia status. As shown in Table 5 and online supplementary Fig. S1, regardless of the status of sarcopenia, the m-NEWS score decreased significantly over time (time effect; P < 0.001). However, regardless of time, the m-NEWS score for the group at risk of sarcopenia was higher than for the non-sarcopenic group, and this difference was statistically significant (group effect; P = 0.002). In the case of interaction effect, it was observed that the diminishing trend of the m-NEWS score in the sarcopenia risk and non-sarcopenic groups was similar, and this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.199).

Due to the m-NEWS score was higher in at risk of sarcopenia group, linear mixed models were used to examine the status of sarcopenia as a predictor of COVID-19 over the studied time points. As hypothesized, the models showed significant associations between sarcopenia status and the m-NEWS score in the trimmed model and in the complete model after controlling for age, sex, BMI, level of education, history of chronic digestive problems, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, serum levels of WBC, PLT, RBC, Hb, PT, CPK and ferritin, O2 saturation, need for oxygen therapy, RR, and PR at T1. The m-NEWS score was 1.9 units higher in the group at risk of sarcopenia than in the non-sarcopenic group in the trimmed model (95 % CI: 0.9 - 2.9, P < 0.001). The m-NEWS score was 5.6 units higher in the group at risk of sarcopenia than in the non-sarcopenic group in the complete model (95 % CI: 3.3 - 8.0, P < 0.001) (Table 6).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies attempting to determine risk of sarcopenia using the SARC-F questionnaire and assessing the relationship between sarcopenia (at baseline) and the score of COVID-19 severity (m-NEWS) during a hospital stay. The validity of SARC-F has previously been confirmed by community screening sarcopenia(36, 37). During the pandemic, this questionnaire became more widely accepted as a screening test for sarcopenia due to quarantine(18, 38). In addition, as reported by previous studies, the m-NEWS system is appropriate for COVID-19 patients(39-41).
The current study showed that, after adjusting for confounding factors, the m-NEWS score in the group at risk of sarcopenia was 5.6-times higher than for the non-sarcopenic group. In agreement with our results, Yao Ma et al.(25) reported that COVID-19 participants with a greater risk of sarcopenia were at greater risk of severe forms of COVID-19. In this study(25), all patients were screened for sarcopenia on admission using the SARC-F scale like our study and the outcomes were assessed according to the WHO interim guidance for COVID-19.
One way to prevent COVID-19 is to quarantine and stay at home; thus, the community will face a greater prevalence of sarcopenia among the elderly caused by nutritional problems and reduced physical activity. A cohort study of older Dutch adults showed that most of them, especially those who lived alone, had difficulty obtaining food, skipped main meals, ate less than

normal, and lost weight, leading to insufficient intake of energy and protein during the pandemic(42).
Protein metabolism disorders are evident in the elderly and are mainly related to an increased need for protein, inadequate food intake, decreased anabolism, elevated degradation, and diminished protein synthesis due to inflamm-aging(43). Aging disturbs the balance of proinflammatory Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-), interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 with antiinflammatory cytokines; this incites a mild inflammation, referred to as inflamm-aging(11, 17, 43). The transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-B (NF-B) also increases with aging in a variety of tissues. NF-B activates inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-, in the body(44). Along with these inflammatory conditions, muscle proteins are broken down and their synthesis is affected, which can result in sarcopenia(11, 45).
Studies have shown that, in patients with severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 virus activates NF-B, resulting in a cytokine storm(46). In addition, during metabolic stress, such as in viral infections, skeletal muscles are catabolised to supply the amino acids required by the immune system, liver, and gastrointestinal tract(47). However, in sarcopenic patients, these reserves are low(11); thus, severe COVID-19 is more probable(11). Our results revealed that the m-NEWS scores for participants at risk of sarcopenia were greater than for non-sarcopenic participants. As anticipated, both groups showed diminishing the m-NEWS scores over time.
With quarantine, staying at home causes a decline in proper physical activity, leading to muscle atrophy and a decreased muscle strength(48). Skeletal muscles release myokines, which play a role in autocrine and endocrine signaling, in addition to muscle regeneration and haemostasis. IL-15 is a myokine that activates natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes, which play an important role in the body's defense against viruses(21). This indicates that sarcopenia is an independent risk factor for worse outcomes of COVID-19 infection(49).
We found that participants at risk of sarcopenia had greater RR than non-sarcopenic participants at T1, independent of the confounders of age, sex, comorbidities, and haemoglobin level. Moreover, participants at risk of sarcopenia were more likely to require oxygen therapy

than non-sarcopenic participants at T3 due to COVID-19, after considering confounding factors. Oxygen therapy (simple mask, reserve bag, nasal prong, etc.) followed a standardized hospital protocol in Iran. A cross-sectional study showed that sarcopenic elderly individuals had lower maximum respiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure than non-sarcopenic elderly individuals(50). A decrease in the diaphragmatic muscle thickness could also explain the higher respiration rates and requirement for O2 therapy(11).
The duration of hospital stay between the at-risk for sarcopenia and non-sarcopenic groups had no statistically significant difference. In contrast, a recent study in South Korea found that people with sarcopenia had significantly longer hospital stays than those without sarcopenia(21). In a recent study in Turkey, adults afflicted with COVID-19 underwent CT scans of the pectoralis muscle area (PMA) and their outcomes (intubation, prolonged hospital stay, and death) were measured(51). They found that PMA was a predictor of longer hospital stays. Increased age is considered to be a strong, independent risk factor for a prolonged hospital stay(52). One reason for the discrepancy between these results and those of our study could be that our investigation was carried out during COVID-19 peak in Iran. As a result of overcrowding of hospitals, patients continued treatment at home as soon as they were able to be discharged from hospital and continued to recover at home, but we only took into consideration the length of the hospital stay.
The strengths of the present study are as follows. First, recruitment was performed in a referral COVID-19 hospital; thus, participants from distinct financial, cultural and societal levels willingly participated in our study. Second, sarcopenia was screened using a web-based platform that ruled out the need for an appointment after discharge that could have been difficult for elderly patients to attend. In addition, the SARC-F questionnaire was completed by an expert nutritionist.
We also had some limitations, the SARC-F questionnaire was completed based on patient recall and we did not confirm the data by measuring skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength(53). However, the SARC-F questionnaire has previously been validated as an effective tool for assessing sarcopenia risk(25, 54). Also, we recorded the data required to calculate the mNEWS at T1, T2, and T3, but we only recorded laboratory results and other COVID-19 symptoms (like cough, digestive disorders, anorexia, and headache) at T1. Fifteen patients were

unable to stand. Therefore, we had to use estimated weight and height for these patients. We checked the effect of this discrepancy in anthropometric measurements by repeating the statistical analysis after excluding the mentioned 15 participants and the results did not change (data are not shown here).
COVID-19 is more easily detected and tends to be more severe in older adults. This is related to a combination of age-related immune system weaknesses and comorbid disorders(55). Therefore, it is recommended that older adults learn ways to prevent sarcopenia through virtual education during the pandemic(20). Adequate intake of energy, protein, calcium, vitamin D, and other micronutrients, along with increased physical activity, improved sleep quality, and stress management would be helpful for preventing sarcopenia(17). The recommended protein intake is at least 1.0 to 1.2 g/kg/d in healthy older adults, 1.2 to 1.5 g/kg/d in malnourished or sarcopenic older adults afflicted with acute or chronic illness, and 2.0 g/kg/d for patients afflicted with severe illness such as COVID-19(18, 56). High-quality proteins should be equally distributed across the three main meals(57). It is also recommended that all sarcopenic patients measure their 25-hydroxyvitamin D level(58).
This study has paved the way for further research to consider the relation between sarcopenia and COVID-19. It is also recommended to measure skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength in addition to completion of the SARC-F questionnaire, as well as to monitor the longterm effects of sarcopenia on COVID-19 complications.
Conclusion
The results of this study showed that the presence of sarcopenia exacerbated COVID-19 severity. These results suggest that patients at risk of sarcopenia had higher RR at the time of admission. Our findings are promising but should be confirmed by more long-term cohort studies to establish a possible positive relationship between sarcopenia and severe COVID-19.

As haemoglobin could affect RR, we adjusted for haemoglobin level at T1. However, since we measured

haemoglobin only at baseline, we did not adjust for this parameter at T2 and T3.
