ABSTRACT Background: Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were authorized for treatment of COVID-19 outpatients based on clinical trials completed early in the pandemic, which were underpowered for mortality and subgroup analyses. Real-world data (RWD) studies are promising for further assessing rapidly-deployed therapeutics.
Journal Pre-proof Research Question: Did mAb treatment prevent progression to severe disease and death across
pandemic phases and based on risk factors including prior vaccination status? Study Design and Methods: This observational cohort study included non-hospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from November 2020-October 2021, using electronic health records from a statewide health system plus state-level vaccine and mortality data. Using propensity matching, we selected approximately 2.5 patients not receiving mAbs for each patient who received mAb treatment under emergency use authorization. The primary outcome was 28day hospitalization; secondary outcomes included mortality and hospitalization severity. Results: Of 36,077 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2,675 receiving mAbs were matched to 6,677 not receiving mAbs. Compared to mAb-untreated patients, mAb-treated patients had lower all-cause hospitalization (4.0% vs 7.7%; adjusted OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.38-0.60) and all-cause mortality (0.1% vs. 0.9%; adjusted OR 0.11, 95%CI 0.03-0.29) to day 28; differences persisted to day 90. Among hospitalized patients, mAb-treated patients had shorter hospital length of stay (5.8 vs. 8.5 days) and lower risk of mechanical ventilation (4.6% vs. 16.6%). Results were similar for preventing hospitalizations during the Delta variant phase (adjusted OR 0.35, 95%CI 0.25-0.50) and across subgroups. Number-needed-to-treat (NNT) to prevent hospitalization was lower for subgroups with higher baseline risk of hospitalization--e.g., multiple comorbidities (NNT=17) and not fully vaccinated (NNT=24) vs. no comorbidities (NNT=88) and fully vaccinated (NNT=81).

Interpretation: Real-world data revealed a strong association between receipt of mAbs and reduced hospitalization and deaths among COVID-19 outpatients across pandemic phases. RWD studies should be used to guide practice and policy decisions, including allocation of scarce resources.

High rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission and illness persist, especially among unvaccinated individuals, as well as those with waning vaccine or infection-related immunity, such as older adults or those with certain chronic medical conditions.1,2 Neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment provides immediate passive immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19.
Journal Pre-proof Several mAb products have received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the US Food and
Drug Administration.3 These authorizations were based on early Phase II/III randomized controlled trials that demonstrated reduction in a combined endpoint of hospitalization or death among high-risk outpatients with early symptomatic infection, though these trials were small in size with few deaths and conducted before the emergence of the Delta variant or widespread availability of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.4-6
Once a promising therapeutic agent has been authorized for emergency use, it becomes more challenging to recruit patients into randomized controlled trials, as patients may seek active therapy and clinicians may view randomization to placebo as unethical.7 Consequently, studies of mAbs following EUA have primarily been small observational trials, confirming reduced hospitalization rates but not large enough to detect a mortality benefit nor to assess any potential heterogeneity of mAb treatment effects by comorbid conditions or vaccination status.8-10 The latter information could be especially useful in policymaking about how best to allocate limited access to mAb treatment during shortages.11,12 Furthermore, no published studies have yet directly evaluated the effectiveness of currently available mAbs against the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, which arose in summer 2021 in the US.
The rapidly-evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, including both the emergence of new variants of the virus and use of EUAs allowing early access to novel therapeutics, makes it critical to build robust research platforms for real-world evidence generation.13,14 In early
4

2021, we created a real-world evidence platform to assess the ongoing clinical impacts of mAb therapy on high-risk outpatients with early symptomatic COVID-19.
Our study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of mAb treatment and progression to severe disease, including hospitalization, severity of hospitalization, and mortality. The goal of the overall platform was to include changes in the pandemic, including emergence of new
Journal Pre-proof variants, in near real-time with sufficient power to assess potential mortality benefits and
effectiveness among patients with various risk factors for progression to severe disease, including vaccination status.

METHODS Study Oversight and Data Sources We conducted a propensity-matched observational cohort study, as part of a statewide implementation/effectiveness pragmatic trial, in a collaboration between University of Colorado researchers, University of Colorado Health leaders, and the Colorado Department of Public
Journal Pre-proof Health and Environment. The study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review
Board with a waiver of informed consent (#21-2935). We obtained data from the electronic health record (EHR; Epic, Verona, WI) of University of Colorado Health, the largest health system in Colorado with 13 hospitals around the state and 141,000 annual hospital admissions. EHR data were merged with statewide data on vaccination status from the Colorado Comprehensive Immunization Information System and mortality from Colorado Vital Records. Patient Population Studied We included patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between November 20, 2020 and October 7, 2021 allowing for at least 28 days of follow-up as of November 4, 2021 (n=36,077), identified using EHR-based date of SARS-CoV-2 positive testing (by polymerase chain reaction or antigen tests) or date of administration of mAb treatment (if no SARS-CoV-2 test result date available). The decision to seek mAb treatment was made by patients and clinicians, and a statewide referral system was established by Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to facilitate patient referrals to facilities for mAb infusion.15 We did not exclude patients solely for lack of EUA eligibility based on EHR data, because not all eligibility criteria were consistently available in the EHR (see additional Methods in the Supplement). We excluded patients who received mAb treatment on the same day of or during hospitalization, as these patients already had the primary outcome. Logistic regression was used for propensity score estimation16 with nearest neighbor matching17 applied to select an approximate 2.5:1 mAb-
6

untreated to mAb-treated matched cohort. Matching factors included baseline demographics, clinical variables, and time (see additional Methods in the Supplement). The primary analysis cohort included patients with a documented mAb administration date (n=2,675) and propensitymatched controls who did not receive mAb treatment (n=6,677). We assessed effectiveness of matching using standardized mean differences.18
Journal Pre-proof Outcomes
The primary outcome was all-cause hospitalization within 28 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, obtained from EHR data. Secondary outcomes included all-cause hospitalization to day 90, all-cause mortality to days 28 and 90, and emergency department (ED) visits to day 28. Among those hospitalized, outcomes included disease severity based on maximum level of respiratory support, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), and rates of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality. Subgroups examined for the primary outcome included age, sex, combined race/ethnicity, insurance status, immunocompromised status, total number of other comorbidities, specific comorbidities, vaccination status, pandemic phase, and type of mAb treatment. Variable Definitions The treatment variable was mAb administration and the primary starting point (time zero) was the date of any SARS-CoV-2 positive test. We imputed missing test dates based on the distribution of observed mAb administration dates (see additional Methods in the Supplement). Hospitalization was defined as any inpatient or observation encounter documented in the EHR. ED visits were defined as any visit to the ED, with or without an associated inpatient or observation encounter. Presence of comorbid conditions were determined using a 90-day look back period in the EHR using established algorithms and immunosuppressed status was further validated by manual chart reviews (see additional Methods in the Supplement). COVID-19
7

disease severity was estimated using ordinal categories of respiratory support requirements at an encounter level, based on the highest level of support received among the following types (in increasing order): no oxygen, standard (nasal cannula/face mask) oxygen, high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation.19 In-hospital mortality was the highest level of disease severity.
Journal Pre-proof Pandemic phase was categorized by SARS-CoV-2 positive date based on the prevalent
variant in Colorado as Pre-Alpha (November 2020 - February 2021), Alpha (March 2021 - June 2021), and Delta (July 2021 - December 2021). No virus sequencing results were available on an individual patient basis. Vaccination status at the time of SARS-CoV-2 positive date was categorized as fully vaccinated (at least 14 days after primary vaccine series) or not fully vaccinated, which included partially vaccinated (receipt of at least one vaccine dose but primary series either not completed or completed within 14 days of SARS-CoV-2 positive test date) or not known to be vaccinated. MAb treatments included bamlanivimab (Eli Lilly), casirivimab + imdevimab (Regeneron), bamlanivimab + etesevimab (Eli Lilly), and sotrovimab (GlaxoSmithKline) (see additional Methods in the Supplement for more details). Statistical analysis We present results descriptively and adjusted for potential confounders. All regression models for outcomes were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status, body mass index (BMI), immunocompromised status, number of comorbidities, pandemic phase, and vaccination status. For binary outcomes such as hospitalization, we used logistic regression to determine odds of the outcome. For count outcomes such as LOS, we used Poisson regression to estimate incidence rates. We analyzed disease severity using ordinal logistic regression to estimate the proportional odds. We constructed cumulative incidence curves using Kaplan-Meier estimates to visually assess temporal trends by treatment status.
8

We conducted subgroup analyses to estimate heterogeneity of treatment effect for the primary outcome of all-cause hospitalization to day 28. For each subgroup, we calculated unadjusted rates of hospitalization, number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one hospitalization (based on absolute risk reduction in unadjusted hospitalization rates), and adjusted relative odds of hospitalization. Results are presented as effect sizes, with 95% confidence intervals, and were
Journal Pre-proof not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Three sensitivity analyses were performed (see additional Methods in the Supplement). Briefly, the first evaluated a full imputation approach for missingness in key variables including BMI, immunocompromised status, race/ethnicity, and number of comorbid conditions. The second included only EUA-eligible subjects as verified by available EHR data. The third used a more conservative imputation method for missing SARS-CoV-2 positive test dates by assuming all missing positive test dates were ten days prior to the mAb administration date (the maximum time difference allowed by the EUA). All outcome models were repeated for these two cohorts and results compared with primary analyses. All statistical analyses were performed using R Statistical Software (version 3.6.0; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).20

RESULTS Characteristics of mAb-Treated and mAb-Untreated Cohorts Of 36,077 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2,675 receiving mAbs were matched to 6,677 patients not receiving mAbs (Appendix Figure 1 in the Supplement). The characteristics of mAb-treated and mAb-untreated patients in the primary cohort are presented in Table 1. The
Journal Pre-proof mAb-treated cohort generally reflects EUA criteria for use of mAbs, with many being older
(40.7% were age 65 years), having higher BMI (50.1% with BMI over 25 kg/m2) and/or having one or more comorbidities (73.6%). While there were clinically important differences between mAb-treated and mAb-untreated patents in the full cohort (Appendix Table 1 in the Supplement), propensity matching eliminated clinically meaningful differences between groups on matching variables (Table 1, Appendix Table 2 in the Supplement). The mean time from positive SARS-CoV-2 test to receipt of mAb treatment was 3.7 days (SD 2.5). Hospitalization and Mortality The rate of 28-day all-cause hospitalization was lower among mAb-treated compared to matched mAb-untreated controls (4.0% v 7.7%; adjusted OR 0.48, 95%CI: 0.38-0.60) (Table 2; full model results Appendix Table 3 in the Supplement). All-cause 28-day mortality in the mAbtreated group was 0.1% compared to 0.9% among the mAb-untreated group (adjusted OR 0.11, 95%CI: 0.03-0.29). These differences persisted to day 90 (adjusted OR 0.53; 95%CI: 0.44-0.65 for 90-day hospitalization and 0.17; 95%CI: 0.06-0.35 for 90-day mortality). Overall ED visit rates were higher for mAb-treated compared to mAb-untreated patients (18.7% vs. 16.9%; adjusted OR 1.24; 95%CI: 1.09-1.40); however, mAb-treated patients had fewer ED visits resulting in hospitalization (16.0% vs. 37.6%; adjusted OR 0.29, 95%CI: 0.21-0.38).
Based on a time-to-event analysis, the benefits associated with reduced hospitalization are largely accrued within 10 days of the positive test date, while the mortality benefit of mAb
10

treatment continues to accrue over 28 days (Figure 1). Treatment benefits persisted to day 90 for both hospitalization and death (Appendix Figure 2 in the Supplement). Severity of Hospitalization For patients requiring hospitalization, prior receipt of mAbs was associated with lower hospital LOS among survivors (5.8 vs. 8.5 days, adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.64, 95%CI: 0.51-0.82)
Journal Pre-proof and a lower rate of ICU admission (12.0% vs. 19.6%; adjusted OR 0.52, 95%CI 0.26-0.97), and
mechanical ventilation or death (4.6% vs. 16.6%; adjusted OR 0.22, 95%CI: 0.07-0.52) (Table 2). For those requiring ICU care, prior receipt of mAbs was associated with shorter ICU LOS (3.5 vs. 8.6 days; adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.22; 95%CI: 0.10-0.48). Overall, severity of hospitalization was lower across the illness continuum for mAb-treated patients (Figure 2). Subgroup Analyses The relative benefit of mAb therapy on reducing 28-day hospital admissions among key demographic and clinical subgroups was broadly similar across all subgroups (Figure 3). Of note, the association between mAb treatment and prevention of hospitalizations was at least as high during the Delta phase (OR 0.35; 95%CI: 0.25-0.50), compared to the Alpha phase (OR 0.67; 95%CI: 0.46-0.98). In addition, there was similar relative effectiveness for fully vaccinated (OR 0.44; 95%CI: 0.25-0.77) and not fully vaccinated (OR 0.49; 95%CI: 0.39-0.62) patients. However, the absolute treatment effect was higher for subgroups with higher baseline risk of hospitalization. For example, the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one hospitalization was 15 for patients age 65 years or older, 17 for those with at least 2 comorbid conditions, and 24 for those not fully vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, compared to NNT of 45 for age 18-45 years, 88 for those without comorbidities, and 81 for fully vaccinated patients. Notably, only a small proportion of patients who were fully vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 were hospitalized
11

(1.8% of mAb-treated and 3.0% of mAb-untreated; Figure 3), and no patients died who were fully vaccinated and received mAb treatment. Sensitivity Analyses Three sensitivity analyses were performed, the first evaluating a full multiple imputation approach to key missing variables, the second restricting the cohort to only patients meeting
Journal Pre-proof EUA eligibility criteria based on available EHR data, and the third using a more conservative
imputation method when the date of positive SARS-CoV-2 test was missing. None of these analyses materially changed the main results (Appendix Tables 4-8 in the Supplement).

DISCUSSION We report real-world evidence that demonstrates novel results on both high effectiveness of mAb treatment in reducing hospitalization during the Delta variant phase and a remarkable overall mortality benefit with an 89% lower mortality at 28 days. Neutralizing mAbs are widely seen as important tools for managing surging cases of COVID-19, yet prior studies could not evaluate
Journal Pre-proof effectiveness of mAbs against Delta variant infections and have been underpowered to evaluate
impact of mAbs on the most clinically important outcome: patient mortality. The present study fills these key knowledge gaps.
There have also been critical gaps in understanding the effects of mAbs on important subgroups of patients, such as those with older age, comorbid conditions, and prior SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. With our large sample size, we demonstrated clinical benefits of mAb administration among virtually all subgroups examined, with similar relative benefits in terms of reduced odds of hospitalizations across all subgroups. These subgroup findings highlight the need to interpret relative benefits in light of highly variable absolute hospitalization rates, because the NNT to avert one hospitalization depends on both mAb effectiveness and baseline rates of hospitalization. For example, we found a similar relative effect size for vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, but the NNT to avert one hospitalization among unvaccinated patients is 24, while the NNT for vaccinated patients is 81. These results are of practical importance for policymakers and clinicians because there have been shortages of mAb supplies and infusion capacity.11,12 Specifically, our findings suggest the most efficient use of limited mAb infusion capacity to alleviate strain on hospitals is to preferentially administer mAbs to patients at highest baseline risk for hospitalization, including those who are older, not fully vaccinated, or with multiple comorbid conditions. Notably, 28-day hospitalization among mAb-treated but not fully vaccinated patients was almost 3-fold higher (5.2%) than for mAb-treated patients who were
13

fully vaccinated (1.8%) and higher even than mAb-untreated patients who were fully vaccinated (3.0%). These data support that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination remains the first line intervention to prevent COVID-19 hospitalizations with mAb treatment best used as supplemental therapy for high-risk patients. Limitations
Journal Pre-proof This study has several limitations. The setting was a single health system; while large and
representing both urban and rural settings and community and academic hospitals, it is geographically limited to one US state. Our sample had relatively low racial and ethnic minority representation, limiting our ability to detect differences across these key subgroups. While we used statewide data for mortality and vaccination status, hospitalizations were collected only within this single health system. If mAb-untreated patients were also less likely to be seen in the health system for other services (hence, more likely to be hospitalized elsewhere), this may bias our results toward the null. We also relied on EHR data, including manual chart reviews, which may have missing or inaccurate information about the presence of chronic conditions.21 These factors might have limited our ability to detect the impact of mAb treatment, especially between subgroups. Our EHR data does not contain information on SARS-CoV-2 variants at the patient level, so variant phases are presented chronologically. However, during Colorado's Delta phase more than 99% of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 was Delta variant.22 Our large sample size allowed the detection of meaningful benefits of mAb therapy for most subgroups, but the study could not detect potentially relevant differences between subgroups. Our propensity scoring method achieved excellent matching between mAb-treated and mAb-untreated patient groups across multiple variables, but unmeasured confounders may remain. Finally, our study was conducted prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant and there is in vitro evidence of reduced SARS-
14

CoV-2 neutralization by some authorized mAbs.23,24 Forthcoming studies will evaluate the effectiveness of each available mAb treatment during the Omicron phase of the pandemic. Interpretation Real-world evidence in this study demonstrated that mAb treatment was associated with lower hospitalizations and deaths among COVID-19 outpatients across multiple pandemic phases,
Journal Pre-proof compared to matched mAb-untreated patients. For hospitalized patients, prior mAb treatment
was associated with notably lower disease severity, including reduced hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, mechanical ventilation, and death. When access to mAbs is limited, prioritizing patients at highest risk for hospitalization has the most potential to reduce health system strain during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Results: We examined outcomes of 36,077 patients with COVID-19 between November 2020 and October 2021 using electronic health record data combined with state-level vaccine and mortality data, and after adjusting for multiple other factors the odds of 28-day hospitalization was reduced by more than half (OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.38-0.60) and odds of death by 89% (OR 0.11, 95%CI 0.03-0.29) among patients receiving mAbs. Results were similar across pandemic phases
Journal Pre-proof and multiple clinical subgroups, but the number-needed-to-treat to prevent hospitalization was
much lower for subgroups with elevated baseline risk of hospitalization. Interpretation: Real-world data revealed a strong association between receipt of mAbs and reduced hospitalization and death among COVID-19 outpatients across multiple pandemic phases and provided valuable data to inform scarce resource allocation decisions.

Supplementary Methods
Description of Demographic Variables Age was determined at the time of positive SARS-CoV-2 test or mAb administration if SARS-CoV-2 test date was not available in the electronic health record (EHR). We categorized age into 18-54, 55-64, and 65 years, based on thresholds that were defined in
Journal Pre-proof the original monoclonal antibody (mAb) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) criteria
(Table S8). Sex was defined as legal sex in the EHR and was binarized into female and male (non-binary status was not explicitly defined), and this field was missing for two subjects. To preserve sample size, the variables race and ethnicity were combined and categorized into non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other. In the subgroup analysis race/ethnicity is binarized into non-Hispanic white and other to allow for a large enough sample size for subgroup analyses. Continuous body mass index (BMI in kg/m2) was categorized into 4 categories: underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9), obese (30.0). The number of comorbid medical conditions was calculated using obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, pulmonary disease, and renal disease, and was categorized into none, one, or two or more. Immunocompromised status was categorized separately. All individual comorbid conditions were considered as binary variables with either evidence of the comorbid condition or no evidence of the comorbid condition in the EHR. EHR Curation of Comorbidities We defined comorbidities based on the updated Charlson and Elixhauser Comorbidity Indices1,2 as implemented in the `icd' R package3 and reported previously from the same health system.4 From the eligibility criteria above, we categorized a patient as having
5

diabetes, renal disease, pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, or immunocompromised status if those conditions were present for that patient in either the Charlson or Elixhauser system. For obesity and hypertension, we used only the Elixhauser system. Because of the importance of immunocompromised status as a risk factor for hospitalization and mortality from COVID-19, we additionally defined patients as immunocompromised if any of the
Journal Pre-proof below medications were present in the EHR medication administration record during the 90-
day lookback period. The list of medications was developed jointly by an expert team of UCHealth pharmacists and Infectious Disease physicians. We evaluated the accuracy of the EHR medication curation by manually reviewing the charts of 2,555 patients. EHR curation accurately classified 85% of patients. Potentially discordant patients most often had received immune-suppressing medications prior to our IRB-approved 90-day lookback period or had received prednisone or methylprednisolone at doses under the expert-defined dose threshold. List of immune-suppressing medications
· Alemtuzumab · Belatacept in past 2 months · Calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine - excludes topical/ophthalmic
administration routes) · Eculizumab · mTOR-inhibitors (everolimus, sirolimus - excludes topical routes) · Mycophenolate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide in the last 1 month · Prednisone or methylprednisolone, oral or IV only (10 mg prednisone equivalent) · Rituximab
6

· Thymoglobulin · TNF- inhibitor (e.g., infliximab, etanercept, golimumab, adalimumab,
certolizumab) Missing Data Techniques Of the 3,164 patients who received mAb treatment, 1,593 (50.3%) were missing an initial
Journal Pre-proof positive SARS-CoV-2 test date in the UCHealth EHR, suggesting many initial tests were
performed outside the UCHealth system. For the primary analysis, a distribution of the time difference between positive SARS-CoV-2 test date and mAb administration date was created for subjects who had both. Then, time differences were randomly sampled with replacement from this distribution and were used to impute positive test dates for the patients who only had a mAb administration date. We evaluated a sensitivity analysis to this approach by imputing the maximum allowed time difference between SARS-CoV-2 positive date and mAb administration date (10 days) for all patients missing the first date.
In the full cohort (prior to propensity matching), 20,010 (55.5%) of patients were missing BMI. This is typical of EHR studies. A missing category for BMI was introduced and BMI with 5 levels (<18.5, 18.5-24.9, 25.0-29.9, 30.0 kg/m2, and missing) was used during propensity matching and analysis. A combination of reported BMI and reported obesity status was used in determining eligibility. A patient was considered eligible if they had a reported BMI higher than the threshold (either 25 or 35 depending on the date) or if they were indicated as "obese" in the EHR.
A complete case analysis was performed for propensity matching. All comorbid conditions were missing from the EHR for 2,077 (5.7%) patients. Race/ethnicity was
7

missing for 1,996 (5.5%) of patients. A total of 3,407 (9.4%) of patients were removed for the propensity matching. We performed sensitivity analysis we evaluated a full multiple imputation approach. We started with the full dataset prior to propensity matching. Variables imputed included continuous BMI, which was then categorized, immunocompromised status, race/ethnicity,
Journal Pre-proof and number of comorbid conditions (none, one, two or more). We used the MICE package
in R to create 20 imputed datasets. For multi-level categorical missing data we used random forest (race/ethnicity and number of comorbid conditions). For immunocompromised we specified logistic regression and for BMI we used linear regression (PMM). Variables included in the imputation model included: 28-day hospitalization, treatment status, age, gender, race/ethnicity, insurance status, comorbid conditions, BMI, and vaccine status. For each of the 20 imputed datasets we used the propensity matching approach described below. We then fitted the outcome model on each of the 20 imputed matched datasets. We combined coefficients from outcome model for treatment by Rubin's B-W calculation to calculate the SE's and 95% CI based on these SE's and then back transformed to the OR scale.
Propensity Matching The propensity matched dataset was created through a logistic regression propensity score matching process. Nearest neighbor matching was used, with a maximum ratio of 3:1 mAbuntreated and mAb-treated groups. In the matching process, we lost both mAb-treated and mAb-untreated subjects and ended up with a ratio of approximately 2.5:1. A common support was used for both the cases and controls, and a caliper width of < 0.2*SD of the propensity distribution was applied4. The standardized mean differences of each level of all
8

covariates included in the model were calculated to compare the means and prevalence in the propensity matched dataset. A standardized mean difference of <0.1 was considered to have a non-meaningful imbalance in the data3.
The baseline characteristics included in the propensity matching process were age in years, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, insurance status, immunocompromised status, number of
Journal Pre-proof other comorbid conditions, and days from initial cohort date, November 20, 2020 (as a
quadratic effect). Model Fitting Each of the models presented in Table 2 were fitted using the same group of adjustment variables. The variables that were included were age, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, insurance status, vaccination status, pandemic phase, number of comorbid conditions, and immunocompromised status. A significance level of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were also used to evaluate clinical significance. Subgroup Analysis To evaluate the potential heterogeneity of the treatment effect across key subgroups of interest the above model for the primary outcome (28-day hospitalization) was fitted separately for each of the 14 subgroups of interest. More specifically, for each subgroup an interaction was included between the subgroup variable and the treatment variable, and the main effects of the other variables included for adjustment. The subgroups investigated included age in years, sex, race/ethnicity, number of comorbid conditions, immunocompromised status, diabetes status, cardiovascular disease status, pulmonary disease status, renal disease status, hypertension status, obesity status, vaccination status, pandemic phase, and mAb medication type.
9

A total of 29 treatment effects were estimated and all subgroup analyses that were performed were reported in Figure 3. Heterogeneity was assessed visually through a forest plot, and subgroup odds ratio estimates were compared. Statistical tests of significance for each interaction term were not reported in the paper, as this analysis was likely underpowered and the potential for Type I error due to multiple comparisons was not
Journal Pre-proof accounted for4. Subgroup analyses were post hoc specified. Within-level results are
presented for each estimated treatment effect by subgroup. In addition, raw counts and rates are reported for each subgroup. The number needed to
treat (NNT) was calculated based on the raw rates as the inverse of the absolute risk reduction. NNT was not calculated for mAb medication type.
