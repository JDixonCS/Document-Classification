It is needless to describe the chemical nature
of the drug here and the literature on the subject of the treatment of malaria by the use of plasmochin is now too extensive to refer to in detail. The observations made by others
may be summarised as follows :?
(1) It has a destructive action on the tropho-
zoites of P. vivax and P. malarice.
(2) It has no such action on the trophozoites of P. falciparum.
(3) With daily doses of 0.06 gramme toxic symptoms may appear, but a dose of 0.04 gramme per day with 20 grains of quinine is
the least toxic but most effective treatment.
In doses of 0.01 gramme per day for 6 days it
can clear out all crescents.

(4) It has a preventive action in the prospective host.
(5) It has a destructive action on the gametocytes of all the three species of malaria para-
sites.
(6) It can prevent the development of gametocytes in man.
(7) It can so affect the gametocytes that, although not apparently destroyed, they are incapable of development into oocysts or sporozoites in the efficient mosquito hosts.
On the last-mentioned point (7) several
workers have made observations in America
and in the Federated Malay States, and the writers of the present article have specially observed the action of small doses of plasmochin on the gametocytes to find out if it can prevent the developmental cycle in the mosquitoes of Bengal. This they consider as very important from the malaria prevention point
of view.
Hence in order to find out how much reliance
can be put on plasmochin to devitalize or sterilize the malaria gametocytes in man and thus prevent infection in mosquito, experiments were made by the authors by feeding mosquitoes on malaria cases with gametocytes in the peripheral blood. The following six species, namely, A. stephensi, A. varuna, A. juliginosus, A. ludlowii, A. maculatus and A. maculatus var. ivillmori were used during the experiments.
The mosquitoes experimented with were all bred out in the Malaria Research Laboratory of the Bengal Public Health Department. The specimens of maculatus and willmori were
hatched out from larvae collected from Kalim-
pong and Sikkim. The imagines after being hatched out were kept in cages provided with water and raisins for a period of 3 to 4 days. It was found necessary to keep the newlyhatched mosquitoes in cages for at least 48 to 72 hours before feeding them on patients because they generally refused to take blood before this period. For feeding on patients they were taken out in glass jars to the malaria
outdoor treatment centre.
The malaria patients who were selected for feeding purposes were picked out from the cases coming to the outdoor treatment centres at Bandel and Singur in the Hooghly district.
Patients come to these centres twice a week.
On the first day of attendance the blood of the selected patient was taken in thin films for examination and he was given a placebo of coloured water only. As a rule 100 microscopic fields were examined in each slide. Only those cases which showed 8 to 12 gametocytes per 100 fields were chosen for the feeding experi-
ments.
When the selected patient attends for the second time, i.e., on the 4th day, the mosquitoes were brought in wide-mouthed glass jars and were put on the pit of the stomach of the patient for about 20 minutes. This batch

of mosquitoes were labelled as ' fed before the administration of plasmochin'. Another blood film was taken on this day for examination and counting of the parasites. After this feed the patient was given plasmoquin only for 3 days with a dosage of 0.02 gramme per day per adult. A daily dose of 0.01 gramme was usually given to a child of
12 years and under.
On the 8th day, i.e., when the patient attended for the third time, the blood of the patient was again examined and a batch of mosquitoes were fed which were labelled as 1 after plas-
mochin \ After the feed the above two batches
of mosquitoes?one that fed on the 4th day before the administration of plasmochin and the second that fed on the 8th day, i.e., after the administration of plasmochin?were transferred to separate cages provided with water and raisins. They were kept at the ordinary

development of parasites within the mosquitoes. On the 8th day, that is, after 3 days' administration of plasmochin he was given treatment with quinine and arsenic as usual, with or without plasmochin.
The table below shows the results with
P. falciparum. In this group of malignant tertian patients, 9 out of 17 cases became free of parasites in all stages after the administration of plasmochin only. The remaining 8 showed rings and crescents although reduced in number. On the patients of this group A. fuliginosus, varuna, stephensi, ludlowii,
maculatus and willmori were fed before the
administration of plasmochin. Those which
survived were dissected with the results stated
below. Similarly a batch of mosquitoes of species A. fuliginosus, varuna, stephensi, ludlowii, maculatus and willmori were fed after the administration of plasmochin.

laboratory room temperature for 12 to 15 days
after which those which survived were dissected
and the results noted.
The whole of these observations were made
during the period from March 1931 to February 1932. The writers were handicapped in the matter of selection of patients by the fact that they were all outdoor patients attending only twice a week and most of them failing to come regularly. There was absolutely no control over these patients.
Observations were made on all three types of parasites. Only thin films were used for the examination of the blood, which was done once on the first day, then on the fourth day, and again on the eighth day.
A placebo of coloured water was invariably given to such patients for the first three days to prevent any possible action on the parasites. Simple drugs such as diaphoretic mixtures have
been noticed to influence the number of para-
sites. On the 4th day when the patient comes again to the centre, he is given only 3 doses of plasmochin to be taken in 3 days. The dose was determined according to the age
calculated on the basis of 0.02 gramme per
adult per day. This was to find out if this. small dose is effective in checking the

None of the mosquitoes fed after the administration of plasmochin were infected with* P. falciparuin, whereas all the species which were fed before plasmochin got the infection in varying percentages.
Similar observations were made in 17 cases
of P. vivax infection. Without any exception the patients in this group, unlike those in the malignant tertian group, became free from parasites after 3 days' administration of small doses of plasmochin only. Anophelines of species A. fuliginosus, varuna, stephensi, and ludlowii were fed on these patients both before and after the administration of plasmochin
and the results of the dissections were noted as
shown below (first table on p. 492). The mosquitoes which were fed after plas-
mochin did not take the infection, whereas all the species except ludlowii developed benign tertian malaria parasites when fed before the administration of plasmochin. The number of ludlowii experimented with was very small in
this group. In 7 out of the 9 P. malaria cases both tro-
phozoites and gametocytes disappeared after the administration of plasmochin for 3 days. In 2 cases trophozoites only persisted for 3 days though they disappeared subsequently on

plasmochin ones got quartan infection in varying percentages as follows :?

/ A. varuna is a very feeble potential carrier in
comparison with the other species of mosquitoes. The percentage of infection in the total of all mosquitoes fed before plasmochin was 16 against nil amongst those fed after the administration of plasmochin. It is seen therefore that even a small dose of 0.02 gramme per day per adult for three days even without quinine will render the parasites incapable of further development in the insect host.
A. varuna were successful in taking infection
when the crescent count was above 20 per 100
fields, except in case No. 3101 which showed
101 crescents. But no conclusion can be drawn
as the number of observations in this particular
case was very small.
Conclusions
(1) Plasmochin even in small doses of 0.02 gramme per day per adult for 3 days without the aid of quinine can reduce the number , of malaria parasites in all stages to such an extent that they are not detectable in 77 per cent, of cases in 100 microscopic fields of an ordinary
thin film.

(2) It is particularly useful in P. vivax and
P. malarice infections.

(3) In cases of P. falciparum infections about 50 per cent, of the cases show parasites in the ring stage and crescents even after the

above-mentioned dose.

(4) It can prevent development of malaria parasites in transmitting species of anopheline

mosquitoes. (5) It is therefore a very valuable drug for

devitalizing the gametocytes in a community

and should be used in all anti-malaria opera-

tions which should aim at the reduction of

gametocytes. The cost will be balanced by the fact that a very small dose can prevent the parasites from developing in mosquitoes.
