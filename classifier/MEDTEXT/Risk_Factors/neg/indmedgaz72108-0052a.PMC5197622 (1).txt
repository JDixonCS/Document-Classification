We welcome the fourth edition of Dr. Leyton's small handbook on the treatment of diabetes mellitus, as it is a very simple exposition of our present knowledge cf the disease. The whole subject has been nicely condensed within 92 pages, two-thirds of which deal with the treatment of the disease.
Dr. Leyton starves his patients for about two days (during which period weak tea, soda water, and plain water in unlimited quantity are allowed), till sugar disappears from the urine and the blood-sugar falls below 0.14 per cent. Thereafter a progressive diet, for which Dr. Leyton has given various tables, is given. If by the two days' fasting the urine does not become sugarfree, the patient is investigated as to his renal threshold, and if the blood-sugar persists above 0.15 per cent, after a four days' fast, insulin is given.
Dr. Leyton has considered the details of the treatment under three heads: (1)' by diet alone, (2) by diet with insulin, and (3) by other preparations, with or without restrictions in diet.
We are sure that the book will be appreciated by the general practitioner, for whom it is especially intended.
