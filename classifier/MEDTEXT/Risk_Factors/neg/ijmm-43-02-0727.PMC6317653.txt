Abstract. MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are posttranscriptional regulators that serve important roles in osteoclastogenesis and bone metabolism; however, the roles of miRNAs have not been completely clarified. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of miR1005p on the mechanism of liverbone endocrine metabolism. A miRNA microarray analysis was conducted to evaluate the miRNA expression profile during receptor activator of nuclear factorB ligandstimulated osteoclastogenesis. Hematoxylin and eosin and tartrateresistant acid phosphatase staining were performed to analyze the trabecular bone microstructure and osteoclast differentiation. The mRNA and protein expression levels were assessed by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. The results revealed that in vitro osteoclast differentiation and in vivo bone resorption were suppressed by miR1005p overexpression. In vivo, a decrease in miR1005p and an increase in FGF21 were simultaneously observed in mice following ovariectomy (OVX). Bioinformatics analysis and experimental data confirmed that FGF21 was a direct target of miR1005p. Conversely, augmentation of miR1005p using a specific agomir in OVXoperated mice decreased the levels of FGF21 in the serum and liver, and prevented osteoclastogenesis and bone loss. The present study revealed that FGF21 may be a signal molecule associated with the mechanism of liverbone endocrine metabolism and may be targeted by miR1005p. In addition, miR1005p may serve an important role in protecting against OVXinduced osteoporosis.

Introduction
As a dynamic metabolic system, bone modeling or remodeling is modulated by two major bone cells: Osteoblasts, which are able to secrete bone matrix and accelerate calcium (Ca) deposition, and osteoclasts, which are responsible for resolving mineralized bone matrix (13). In the process of bone maintenance and repair, extracellular signaling transduction between osteoblasts and osteoclasts serves a crucial role in bone homeostasis (4). For example, osteoblastsecreted receptor activator of nuclear factorB (NFB) (RANK) ligand (RANKL) binds to the RANK receptor on osteoclasts, thus promoting osteoclast survival and osteoclastogenesis (5). In addition, the binding of macrophage colonystimulating factor (MCSF) to its receptor, colony stimulating factor receptor, has been reported to be essential for the generation of osteoclast precursor cells that are present prior to RANKL stimulation (2). Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor receptorassociated factor6activated NFB signaling induces the initialization of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), which is a key transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis and stimulates the expression of various osteoclastspecific genes, including tartrateresistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K (Ctsk) and calcitonin receptor (2,5).
MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are a class of small, singlestranded, noncoding RNA molecules, 1824 nucleotides in length, which can regulate gene expression or translation by targeting 3'untranslated regions (3'UTRs). miRNAs serve as a novel class of posttranscriptional regulators that are involved in diverse biological functions (68). Previous studies have reported that miRNAs serve important roles in regulating skeletal development (9,10). For example, overexpression of miR34a, miR125a and miR503 inhibits osteoclastogenesis to rescue bone loss (9,11,12). Conversely, miR214 promotes osteoclastogenesis, and inhibits osteoblast differentiation and bone formation (10,13). miR100 is a member of the miR99 family (14) and participates in various biological processes, including chemotherapy resistance, apoptosis, osteogenic differentiation and osteoporotic fractures (1518). However, the role of miR100 in ovariectomy (OVX)induced osteoporosis and osteoclastogenesis remains unclear.
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 is a member of the FGF family, which is mainly expressed in the liver, and has numerous metabolic functions (19). FGF21 has been demonstrated to

improve obesityassociated glucose and lipid metabolic disorders (20), renal dysfunction (21), cardiac hypertrophy (22) and ethanolassociated liver injury (23). Conversely, upregulation of FGF21 is an independent risk factor associated with the severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (24). In a dietinduced mouse model of obesity, a reduction in plasma FGF21 levels and hepatic FGF21 resistance by exenatide protects against highfat dietinduced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (25). Emerging evidence has highlighted that FGF21 may serve as a potent regulator of skeletal homeostasis (26). In a Han Chinese population, a significant inverse correlation is observed between plasma FGF21 levels and bone mineral density (BMD) of the femoral neck and Ward's triangle (27). An increase in serum FGF21 levels is also negatively associated with BMD and bone mineral content in human immunodeficiency virus1infected patients (28). However, fasting plasma FGF21 levels in healthy women exhibit a strong positive association with total BMD and spine BMD (29). Notably, FGF21knockout in mice results in a highbonemass phenotype, whereas FGF21 gainoffunction decreases bone mass and promotes osteoclastogenesis (26,30). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of FGF21enhanced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption have not been completely clarified.
The present study screened the expression profile of miRNAs in the process of MCSF and RANKLinduced osteoclastogenesis using a miRNA microarray. The results demonstrated that miR1005p was downregulated and functioned as a negative regulator of osteoclastogenesis. miR1005p gainoffunction significantly suppressed osteoclast activity in vitro. In vivo, treatment with the agomirmiR1005p inhibited FGF21 expression and osteoclast activity, and prevented bone loss in mice following OVX.
Materials and methods
Cell culture. The present study was approved by the Animal Ethical Committee of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University (Shenyang, China; approval no. 2016PS361K). Murine bone marrowderived macrophages (BMMs) were obtained form female C57BL/6J mice, as described previously (31). BMMs were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium (HyClone; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Logan, UT, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) and 1% penicillinstreptomycin at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Nonadherent cells were cultured in MCSF (50 ng/ml; R&D Systems China Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) for 3 days to induce osteoclast precursors. For osteoclast differentiation, osteoclast precursors were incubated with MCSF (50 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml; R&D Systems China Co., Ltd.) for another 3 days (Fig. 1A). Osteoclasts with 3 nuclei/cell were identified as TRAPpositive cells. The NCTC1469 mouse normal liver cell line (serial number: 3111C0001CCC000290) was obtained from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences & National Infrastructure of Cell Line Resource (Shanghai, China). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) supplemented with 5% FBS, in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 and 95% air (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.).

Differentially expressed miRNAs in RANKLinduced osteoclast differentiation. Osteoclast differentiation was induced as shown in Fig. 1A. Subsequently, miRNA expression profiling of osteoclasts was conducted using the mouse miRNA expression profiling array V.2 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hierarchical clustering was performed to determine similarity using complete linkage and Euclidean distance using MeV software (version 4.2.6; http://mev.tm4.org/#/welcome) (32). The miRNAs with a foldchange of >2 in response to RANKLstimulated osteoclast differentiation compared with precursor cells were selected to determine the expression profile.
Animal model. Female C57BL/6J mice (age, 8 weeks; body weight, 20±2 g) were obtained from the Animal Center of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, and were allowed to acclimate for 1 week in a temperaturecontrolled environment (25±2°C; humidity, 55±5%) under an artificial 12h light/dark cycle with free access to food and tap water. Mice were randomly divided into four groups (n=6/group) and underwent either sham operation or bilateral OVX. AgomirmiR1005p (5'AACCCGUAGAUCCGAACUUGU G3') and control agomir (agomirCon; 5'AGUUUAGCU AACGGUGAGCCGA3') were purchased from Guangzhou RiboBio Co. Ltd. Surgical operations were performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg/kg; SigmaAldrich; Merck KGaA) by intraperitoneal injection. The sham group received the same surgical operation as the OVX group without ovariectomy, whereas mice in the OVX group the ovaries were excised. The groups were as follows: i) Sham group, shamoperated mice were treated with normal saline; ii) OVX group, OVXoperated mice were treated with normal saline; iii) OVX + agomirCon group, OVXoperated mice were treated with agomirCon; iv) OVX + agomirmiR group, OVXoperated mice were treated with agomirmiR1005p (100 mg/kg) via a tail vein injection. After a 4week treatment with the agomirs (twice/week), mice were euthanized and blood was harvested from the heart. Serum, liver and tibia samples were immediately collected and maintained at 80°C for further analysis.
Reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR). Total RNA was extracted from RANKLstimulated precursor cells, NCTC1469 cells, and liver and tibia samples using TRIzol® (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT was performed using TaqMan® reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. miR1005p was detected using TaqMan® MicroRNA assay (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The thermocycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 60 sec. U6 small nuclear RNA was used as an endogenous control. Relative miR1005p expression levels were calculated using the 2Cq method (33).
In addition, 2 µg total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA with moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the

RTqPCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems 7300 RealTime PCR system (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) with the TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The cycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 30 sec, and a final extension step at 72°C for 3 min. The relative mRNA expression levels were calculated using the 2Cq method (33) and were normalized to GAPDH. The primers were synthesized by Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. and sequences are presented in Table I.
Cell transfection and plasmid constructs. PremiRcontrol (PremiRCon) and premiR1005p were synthesized by Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). Osteoclast precursors (1x105) were seeded in 6well plates and transfected with premiRCon (5'AGUUUAGCUAACGGUGAGC CGA3') or premiR1005p (5'AACCCGUAGAUCCGAACU UGUG3') using Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientifc, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) for 48 h at 37°C at final concentrations of 100 nM, according to the manufacturer's protocol.
TRAP staining. RANKLstimulated precursor cells and tibia samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and 24 h, respectively, at room temperature. Tibia histological sections (5 µm) were obtained following decalcification in 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) and were embedded in paraffin, according to standard histological procedures. RANKLstimulated precursor cells and tibia histological sections were stained for TRAP activity using a 0.1 M acetate solution (pH 5.0) containing 6.76 mM sodium tartrate, 0.1 mg/ml naphthol ASMX phosphate and 0.5 mg/ml Fast Red Violet. The TRAP staining kit was purchased from SigmaAldrich; Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). TRAPpositive multinucleated cells with three or more nuclei were scored and visualized under

a microscope (Leica DM 2500; Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany).
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Tibias were fixed with 4% formalin at room temperature for 24 h, decalcified in 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) and were then embedded in paraffin, according to standard histological procedures. Tibia tissues were cut into 5 µm sections, which were stained with H&E (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stained slides were visualized under an optical microscope (Leica DM 2500; Leica Microsystems GmbH) and were analyzed using the OsteoMeasure system (OsteoMetrics Inc., Decatur, GA, USA).
Bone Ca content and BMD. Ca content in the tibia was determined following incineration of the samples using a muffle furnace (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) at 800°C for 12 h. Subsequently, 10 mg bone ash was dissolved in 1 ml 37% HCl diluted with MilliQ® water. The Ca content was determined using a kit (cat. no. C0043; Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The BMD of the tibia was measured by dualenergy Xray absorptiometry (Lunar DPXIQ; GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA), as described previously (34).
Physiological and biochemical markers in serum and urine samples. The levels of FGF21 in mouse serum were detected using a mouse bioactive ELISA kit (cat. no. EELM0029c; Elabscience Biotechnology, Wuhan, China), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The levels of Ca (cat. no. C0043), phosphorus (P; cat. no. C006) and creatinine (cat. no. C0111) in serum and urine samples were measured using kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute), according to the manufacturer's protocol.

differences were analyzed by oneway analysis of variance, followed by a post hoc Tukey test for multiple comparisons. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Results
miR1005p is downregulated during RANKL and MCSFinduced osteoclastogenesis. BMMs were initially cultured in MCSF (50 ng/ml) for 3 days to induce formation of osteoclast precursors, which were stimulated by MCSF (50 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml) for a further 3 days to induce osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 1A). A miRNA microarray analysis was conducted to determine the molecular mechanism involved in RANKL and MCSFinduced osteoclastogenesis. The results demonstrated that 31 miRNAs were differentially expressed in osteoclast precursors with RANKL stimulation, compared with in those without RANKL stimulation, among

which 13 and 18 miRNAs were downregulated and upregulated, respectively (Fig. 1B). The expression levels of miR1005p were most significantly decreased in RANKLstimulated cells. In addition, the expression of miR1005p was validated by RTqPCR; the results were consistent with the microarray analysis and indicated that expression was decreased in a timedependent manner in response to RANKL and MCSFinduced osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the protein expression levels of TRAP were significantly augmented during the process of osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 1D).
Overexpression of miR1005p suppresses RANKL and MCSFinduced osteoclastogenesis. To investigate the function of miR1005p in vitro, premiR1005p was transfected into osteoclast precursors, in order to amplify the expression of miR1005p; the results revealed a significant upregulation (~120fold) of miR1005p in osteoclast precursors (Fig. 2A). Posttransfection with premiR1005p, the

key transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis, NFATc1 (Fig. 2B), and osteoclastspecific genes, Ctsk (Fig. 2C), matrix metalloproteinase9 (MMP9) (Fig. 2D) and TRAP (Fig. 2E), were significantly decreased compared with in the premiRCon group. Furthermore, osteoclast differentiation (TRAPpositive multinucleated cells) was blocked by premiR1005p (Fig. 2F). These findings indicated that miR1005p, as a suppressor, may neutralize RANKL and MCSFinduced osteoclastogenesis.
AgomirmiR1005p blocks OVXinduced bone resorption. The present study also examined whether overexpression of miR1005p regulates bone metabolism in vivo. Osteoporotic status was induced by OVX in mice, and OVXoperated mice were administered agomirmiR1005p or agomirCon via a tail vein injection. ELISA analyses revealed that bone formation markers, ALP and osteocalcin, and bone resorption markers, TRAP5b and CTX, were downregulated and upregulated, respectively, in OVXoperated mice. Conversely, agomirmiR1005p treatment reversed OVXinduced marker alterations, with the exception of serum ALP (Table II).
RTqPCR analysis revealed that miR1005p levels were significantly downregulated in the tibia from OVXoperated mice compared with in the tibia from shamoperated mice, whereas in OVXoperated mice injected with agomirmiR1005p OVXinhibited miR1005p levels were markedly rescued in the tibia (Fig. 3A). Subsequently, the mRNA expression levels of osteoblastspecific genes [Runtrelated transcription factor 2 (Runx2), osterix, osteocalcin and ALP] were detected, and it was confirmed that these genes were reduced in the tibia from OVXoperated mice, whereas agomirmiR1005p administration in OVXoperated mice significantly upregulated the mRNA expression levels of Runx2, osterix, osteocalcin and ALP (Fig. 3B). Conversely, the mRNA ratio of RANKL/osteoprotegrin (OPG) was elevated in the tibia from OVXoperated mice, suggesting that an increase in osteoclast activity in OVXoperated mice may be associated with overactivation of RANKL availability; however, upregulation of the RANKL/OPG ratio was reversed by agomirmiR1005p administration in OVXoperated

mice (Fig. 3C). To further investigate whether miR1005p inhibited OVXinduced bone resorption, osteoclastspecific genes, NFATc1, Ctsk, MMP9, carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) and TRAP, were detected by RTqPCR; the results demonstrated that agomirmiR1005p treatment markedly abolished OVXinduced upregulation of osteoclastspecific genes in the tibia (Fig. 3D). In addition, as determined by western blotting, OVXoperated mice exhibited a significant increase in RANK, RANKL and NFATc1, whereas agomirmiR1005p administration decreased the protein expression levels of RANK, RANKL and NFATc1 in the tibia from OVXoperated mice(Fig. 3E and 3F).
Ca and P metabolism were also analyzed in OVXoperated mice in response to agomirmiR1005p administration. Compared with in agomirCon treated OVXoperated mice, agomirmiR1005p administration significantly increased serum Ca concentration and blocked urinary Ca secretion; however, the serum and urine levels of P were not markedly altered in response to OVX operation or agomirmiR1005p administration (Table II). Bone Ca content and tibia BMD were decreased by OVX and were increased by agomirmiR1005p administration in OVXoperated mice (Fig. 4A and B). Histomorphological observation by H&E staining revealed that the integrity of the trabecular bone microstructure network was destroyed in the proximal epiphysis of the tibia by OVX. However, agomirmiR1005p administration markedly improved trabecular bone structure and accelerated bone remodeling (Fig. 4C and D). Furthermore, the function of agomirmiR1005p on osteoclast differentiation was determined in vivo. TRAP staining revealed that the number of osteoclasts was increased by OVX, whereas osteoclast numbers were significantly decreased by agomirmiR1005p treatment (Fig. 4E and F). Collectively, these findings suggested that increased bone mass in agomirmiR1005padministered OVXoperated mice may be caused by a combination of increased bone formation and decreased bone resorption.

results revealed that miR1005p was significantly decreased in the liver of OVXoperated mice compared with in the shamoperated group, whereas agomirmiR1005p injection rescued OVXinduced downregulation of miR1005p expression in the liver (Fig. 5A). Consistent with previous findings (26,30), the present results indicated a significant increase in the mRNA expression (Fig. 5B), serum levels (Fig. 5C) and protein expression (Fig. 5D and E) of FGF21 in the liver of OVXoperated mice. Notably, both liver and serum FGF21 levels were suppressed by agomirmiR1005p injection in OVXoperated mice (Fig. 5BE).
To further investigate whether FGF21 is a direct target of miR1005p, the online prediction software TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.org/vert_72/) was used to predict the association between miR1005p and FGF21. It was revealed that the 3'UTR of FGF21 contained one conserved binding site for miR1005p, which was presented as a complementary

pairing (Fig. 6A). To confirm this finding, luciferase reporter plasmids containing WT or MUT 3'UTR of FGF21 were cotransfected with premiRCon and premiR1005p into the NCTC1469 mouse normal liver cell line. The results revealed that the luciferase activity was reduced by ~60% in cells transfected with plasmids containing WT 3'UTR of FGF21 and premiR1005p; however, premiR1005p had no effect on luciferase activity in cells transfected with plasmids containing MUT 3'UTR of FGF21 (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, to identify the action of miR1005p on FGF21, NCTC1469 cells were transfected with premiRCon or premiR1005p and the mRNA and protein expression levels of FGF21 were measured. Compared with in the premiRCon group, overexpression of miR1005p significantly downregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of FGF21 (Fig. 6C and D). These findings suggested that FGF21 may be a direct target of miR1005p.

Based on the aforementioned findings, it was revealed that miR1005p was inhibited during the process of osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in OVXinduced bone loss in vivo. FGF21, as a potential proosteoclastogenic liver hormone, may be involved in RANKL/RANK/NFATc1 cascade

signalingmediated osteoclast differentiation, whereas agomirmiR1005p, as a posttranscriptional regulatory factor targeted to the FGF21/RANKL/RANK/NFATc1 pathway, may block osteoclastogenesis and OVXinduced bone loss (Fig. 7).

Discussion
The present study confirmed that the expression of miR1005p was downregulated during RANKLinduced osteoclastogenesis, as determined by microarray and RTqPCR analyses. miR1005p gainoffunction markedly inhibited the process of osteoclast differentiation and negatively regulated osteoclast function by suppressing the mRNA expression levels of osteoclastspecific genes in vitro. The present results also suggested that Ca metabolism and trabecular bone remodeling were improved, and osteoclast differentiation and activity were decreased by agomirmiR1005p in OVXoperated mice. Furthermore, as a crucial liver hormone, FGF21 was upregulated and involved in OVXinduced bone resorption. Notably, agomirmiR1005p abrogated OVXinduced upregulation of FGF21 in the liver and serum; FGF21 was validated as a direct target of miR1005p by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase activity assay. Overexpression of miR1005p resulted in the downregulation of FGF21 mRNA and protein expression in NCTC1469 cells. Based on these findings, it was suggested that agomirmiR1005p alleviated osteoclast differentiation and bone loss by blocking liversecreted FGF21; FGF21 may lead to overactivation of the RANKL/RANK/NFATc1 signaling pathway, thus mediating osteoclastic bone resorption.
miRNAs are posttranscriptional regulators that mediate the expression of bone metabolismassociated genes at transcriptional and translational levels (911,13). For example, overexpression of miR503 prevents bone resorption and osteoclast activity in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting RANK expression (11). miR34a, as a key osteoclast suppressor, blocks osteoporosis by suppressing transforming growth factorinduced factor 2 in mice (9). Furthermore, miR214 leads to a decline in bone formation by inhibiting activating transcription factor 4 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (10,13). These results suggested that a regulatory mechanism including numerous miRNAs, or one miRNA, may target various genes involved in the process of osteoclastogenesis and bone loss (911,13). A previous study reported that miR100 modulates human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation into osteoblasts, and promotes osteogenesis in response to mechanical stress (36). Conversely, miR100 serves a negative role in osteogenic differentiation derived from human adiposederived MSCs by targeting bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (18). The present study revealed that downregulation of miR1005p was accompanied by an increase in the expression levels of FGF21 in the liver samples of OVXoperated mice. Further investigations indicated that FGF21 was a direct target of miR1005p, which could inhibit FGF21 levels in the serum and liver; osteoclast activity and bone loss were suppressed by agomirmiR1005p injection in OVXoperated mice. These observations provided an insight into liverbone endocrine signaling and suggested that miR1005p targeted FGF21 to inhibit its hepatic expression and contributed to the regeneration of bone under pathophysiological conditions.
FGF21 is a hepatokine that is mainly expressed in the liver (26,30). FGF21 is considered a potential novel drug for the treatment of obesity and diabetes by potentiating the effect

of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor  (PPAR) (37). Furthermore, FGF21 inhibits osteoblastogenesis from MSCs and stimulates osteoclastogenesis from hematopoietic stem cells by activating PPAR, whereas bone mass is markedly restored by FGF21 deletion (26,37). A previous study (36), and the present findings, revealed that miR1005p exerted an opposite effect to FGF21 on osteoclast differentiation. A functional study revealed that FGF21 was a direct target of miR1005p, and agomirmiR1005p effectively blocked FGF21 secretion from the liver, inhibited osteoclastogenesis and osteoclastspecific gene expression, and stimulated bone formation and osteoblastspecific gene expression. FGF21 was inducible in the liver but absent in the bone, thus suggesting that FGF21stimulated osteoclast differentiation and bone loss may be mediated via a liverbone endocrine metabolic mechanism in OVXoperated mice.
In conclusion, the present results demonstrated that alterations in the expression levels of miR1005p may lead to an alteration in bone homeostasis and osteoclast differentiation. These phenomena may be associated with the hepatokine FGF21. The present experimental evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies strongly indicated that miR1005p could prevent bone resorption and osteoclastogenesis, at least partially, through inhibition of FGF21 secretion from the liver. This finding may provide a novel insight into the management of osteoporosis and osteoclastassociated bone diseases.
