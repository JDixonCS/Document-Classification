J uvenile dermatomyos itis (DM) is a multisystem disease characterized by nonsuppurative inflammation of striated muscle, skin and the gastrointestinal tract, and also characterized early in its course by an immune complex vasculitis and, later, the development of ca lcinosis1). Although the etiology of juve nile DM re ma ins unclear, it is suggested that IgE can be associated with autoimmune diseases, s uch as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and juvenile DM, by mediating the release of chemical mediators and by faciliating the local de position of immune complexes2 ). Inte rcurre nt infections with elevated serum IgE level during the course of the

disease give rise to problems in patients with juvenile DM. Atopic dermatitis, or development of calcinos is, may contribute to this proble m3 , 4 ). HIE also has the characteristic findings of recurrent infections of the skin and sinopulmonary tract and high serum IgE level. Other findings of HIE include eosinophilia, presence of anti- S.aureus specific IgE, defect of neutrophil chemotaxis, poor delayed hypersensitivity responses and ecze matoid de rmatitis5 ). He rein, we describe a patie nt with juvenile DM complicating HIE.

A 13- year- old girl was admitted to the hos pital because of multiple skin abscesses. Six years before admission, juvenile dermatomyositis was diagnosed at another hospital on the basis of symptoms of proximal muscle weakness, abnormal findings of muscle biopsy, elevated serum muscle enzyme and skin rash on her face. She had not been managed with regular follow- up. There was a history of recurrent skin infections,

pneumonia and eczematous dermatitis over the whole body after the diagnosis of juvenile dermatomyositis. She denied any history of allergic diseases. There was no family history of s pecific diseases. The temperature was 38.0¡ , the pulse was 116 and the res pirations were 24. The blood pressure was 90/50 mmHg. On physical examination, the skin of her entire body showed multiple hyperpigmented lesions, lichenoid patches and eczemaoid confluent plaques. Oral thrus h and subcutaneous cold abscesses of the left upper eye lid, back and right lower quadrant abdomen were found (Fig. 1). No lymphadenopathy was observed. The lungs were clear. Both knee joints had flexion contractures with muscle atrophy. The following laboratory findings were recorded: hemoglobin 10.5 gm/dl, white blood cell count 15,000/§§ (88,3 % neutrophils, 6.6 % lymphocytes, 3.5 % monocytes, 0.2 % eosinophils, 1.4 % basophils), platelet count 288,000/§§, erythrocyte sedimentaion rate 68mm/hour (Westergren method), The protein was 6.7 g/dl (albumin 3.2 g/dl; globulin 3.5 g/dl). The values for glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, aldolase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potasium, chloride and magnesium were normal. Urine analys is was normal except for proteinuria(+). Levels of C3, C4 and CH50 were normal. The tests for antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, VDRL, hepatitis surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody and C- reactive protein were negative. Antibodies to Sm, RNP, Ro, La, Jo- 1 and ds DNA were not detected. Serum immunoglobulin examination revealed normal IgG ( 1,970 mg/dl; normal 800- 1,500 mg/dl ), IgM ( 111 mg/dl; normal 45- 150 mg/dl ), elevated IgA ( 455 mg/dl; normal 90- 325 mg/dl ) and IgE (6,650 mg/dl; normal <200 mg/dl ).

Anti- S. aureus specific se rum IgE was measured with S. aureus Wood 46 stra in (Sigma) in our patie nt (P), five patie nts with bronchia l asthma (A) a nd three bacte re mic patients with S. aureus (S) by direct ELISA as Dreskin's method with some modifications. All sa mples we re assayed in duplicate .
Follow- up serum IgE levels decreased with the treatment of S. aureus infection, but still remained high ( 3,180 mg/dl, 3,120 mg/dl). Immunoelectrophoresis of serum revealed no evidence of paraproteinemia. Radiographs of the abdomen and both lower extremities s howed multiple soft tissue calcifications . EMG and muscle biopsy findings were compatible with inflammatory myopathy ( Fig. 2 ). Antibodies to S. aureus of the IgE class were detected by direct ELISA method, as previously described, with some modifications6 ) ( Fig. 3 ).

and proteus was negative. Radioallergosorbent tests to common allergens were negative except for Penicillium notatum. Bacteriologic cultures from skin abscesses were positive for S. aureus . Cultures from oral mucous lesion grew Candida albicans . The total numbers of T cells , T cell subpopulations (CD4+/CD8+) were within normal limits . The Nitroblue- Tetrazolium- test was normal. In vitro lymphocyte proliferation was normal exposure to nonspecific antigens (phytohemagglutinin, phorbol myristate acetate plus ionomycin). The polymorphonuclear leukocyte motility, assessed in a reversible Boyden chamber with fmet- leu- phe and patient's serum as che mo- attracta nts, as prevoiusly described5 ), was impaired. She was successfully managed with surgical drainage and antibiotics.
DIS C US S IO N
Some diseases, including chronic granulomatous disease, Wiskott- Aldrich syndrome, icthyosis vulgaris, severe combined immunodeficiency and HIE, have similiar clinica l findings of recurre nt s kin infections7 ). This patient was diagnosed as having HIE on the basis of recurrent infections of skin and pulmonary, extremely elevated levels of serum IgE and presence of anti- S.aureus specific IgE, chemotactic defect of neutrophile, eczematoid dermatitis and normal nitroblue tetrazolium test. The late onset of her recurrent infection and normal eos inophil count were atypical. But these have bee n obse rved in othe r re ports5 ). S.aureus a nd C. ablicans were isolated from skin cold abscesses and oral cavity, respectively, in this case. These organis ms are known to be most predominant pathogens in recurrent infections of HIE5 ). S. aureus infection with elevated serum IgE is rarely observed in juvenile DM, and this can be partially explained by the previous two reports. First, atopic dermatitis, which is frequently accompanied by S. aureus, has a higher tendency for developing juvenile DM3 ). Second, the deve lopme nt of ca lcinos is a nd granulocyte chemotactic defect in juvenile DM is associated with sta phylococca l infections4 ). The ca uses of recurrent skin infections of S. aureus in this patient are pres umed to have a somewhat different mechanism from those two. Hochreutener et al suggested that increased S. aureus specific IgE level, decreased S. aureus specific IgA level, diminished chemotaxis and soft tissue abscesses can be differential points between atopic dermatitis and HIE, but chemotactic defect and

anti- S.aureus specific IgE were found to be not only HIE but a lso atopic de rmatitis8 , 9 ). So, sometimes , it may be hard to differentiate HIE from atopic dermatitis in a patient with juvenile DM who has elevated IgE level and S.aureus infection. Differential diagnosis is important because treatment and prognosis is different. Atopic dermatitis does not have recurrent infections of the s inopulmonary tracts and peculiar cold abscesses and has a dermatitis that differs in character and distribution from lesions of HIE5 ). This patie nt denied any history of allergy, and RAST(radioallergosorbent test) to common allergens, except for Penicillium notatum, were negative. Moore et al emphasized the relationship between the development of calcinosis and recurrent staphylococcal infections with raised IgE in juve nile DM4 ). Although the level of serum IgE in Moore's cases are elevated, most of them do not meet the definition of HIE (¡^ 2,000 IU/ml). But this patient had extremely elevated IgE level (6,600 IU/ml) during infection and had constantly raised serum IgE levels (¡^ 3,000 IU/ml) during follow- up. Anti- S.aureus s pecific IgE was detected only during S. aureus infection in this case. Calcinosis occurs commonly with scleroderma, as well as dermatomyositis , and rarely in association with SLE10). HIE has bee n ra rely re ported in patie nts with S LE11- 13 ), but these cases had no association with calcinosis. Calcinosis develops in up to ha lf the patie nts with juve nile de rmatomyositis1). It must be clarified whether recurrent skin infection with elevated IgE occurs in most juvenile DM patients with calcinosis or not. Although the immunologic bas is of elevated serum IgE in patients with HIE has not been defined, a deficie ncy of suppressor T ce ll to inhibit IgE production5 ), imbalances between IL- 4 producing and IFN- ¥ª producing he lpe r T ce lls14 ) a nd decreased meta bolism of IgE15 ) see m to be respons ible for e levated leve ls of IgE. The re we re re ports that CD8+ to CD4+ ratio was reduced in a patie nt with juve nile DM16 ). But this was not found in our case. The causes of susceptibility to infections have not been documented. Schopfer et al suggest that histamine is released on crosslinkng of mast cell- bound antistaphylococcal IgE by staphylococcal antigens and interferes with the activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, resulting in the failure of effective S. aureus clea ring17 ). It is known that there is varia bility in both HIE and juvenile DM patient's neutrophil and monocyte che motaxis5 ). Whethe r the neutrophils were intrinsica lly abnormal or not was inconclusive in a patient with HIE, but chemotactic defect of neutrophil to fmet- leu- phe and

patient's serum as chemo- attractants was observed in this case. HIE has significantly lower proportions of circulating T cells that can produce IFN- ¥ª and TNF- ¥Æ, in comparison with normal controls, which also may contribute to recurrent infections14). In conclusion, simila r findings, including elevated serum IgE, anti- S.aureus IgE and chemotactic defect of neutrophil, can be found in patients with HIE, juvenile DM and atopic dermatitis . HIE must be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient with juvenile DM who has an elevated level of IgE and staphylococcus aureus skin infection. It will be interesting to define whether the underlying mechanism is the same or not in these diseases.
