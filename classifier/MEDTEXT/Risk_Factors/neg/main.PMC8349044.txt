ABSTRACT
Pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma (PMEC) is an extremely rare tumor of the respiratory system. The clinical presentation of PMEC is variable and nonspecific, including cough, hemoptysis, and wheezing, and may mimic other symptoms of pneumonia or asthma. Here, we present a case of PMEC in a 12-year-old male who was diagnosed with and treated for asthma for 2 years. The patient presented with symptoms of respiratory failure that did not respond to steroids or bronchodilator medications. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans revealed an endotracheal tumor. The patient underwent complete tumor resection, with no signs of recurrence 6 months after treatment.

1. Introduction
Primary pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma originates from the glands that line the tracheobronchial tree [1] and represents approxi­ mately 0.1%-0.2% of all primary lung tumors [2]. PMEC often affects younger patients compared with other, more common types of lung cancer [3]. Due to the tumor location, patients typically present with symptoms associated with bronchial obstruction and atelectasis [3]. The tumors can be classified as low-grade or high-grade based on histo­ pathological results [3]. Complete surgical resection remains the pri­ mary therapy for PMEC [4]. This case emphasizes the roles of imaging and histopathology in the diagnosis, exclusion of other diseases, and avoidance of misdiagnosis and mistreatment.
2. Case report
A 12-year-old male patient who was diagnosed with asthma 2 years prior presented with increasing shortness of breath, wheezing, and

cough. The patient had no history of allergies. The patient had previ­ ously been hospitalized several times due to the same symptoms and was treated with bronchodilators and steroids; however, the symptoms did not improve and appeared to increase in severity. A blood test revealed increased neutrophil cell count (13 G/L) and C-reactive protein level (25 mg/L). A chest computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which revealed an intratracheal mass. This mass was well-circumscribed with homogeneous enhancement (Fig. 1). The lung parenchyma was normal, and no mediastinal lymph nodes were observed. Bronchoscopy and tumor resection were indicated. The histological results demonstrated that the tumor cells included epidermoid, mucous, and intermediate cells without keratinization (Fig. 2). The final diagnosis was a low-grade PMEC tumor with negative surgical margins. The patient was not treated with any adjuvant therapy. After surgery, the symptoms of breathless­ ness and wheezing disappeared. Chest CT scans 6 months after surgery showed no signs of recurrence (Fig. 1).

3. Discussion
Lung cancer is quite rare in children. Smoking and asbestos exposure do not appear to be risk factors for PMEC [5]. PMEC affects male and female individuals equally and is primarily located in the trachea and bronchus [1]. Only 5% of PMEC cases are classified as high-grade, with the majority (95%) classified as low-grade [6]. Low-grade tumors often occur in young patients, whereas high-grade tumors are more likely to be observed in older patients [7].
The chest radiography may show consolidation, atelectasis, or a solitary lung nodule or mass; however, the chest X-ray may also appear normal in the case of a small endobronchial tumor without airway obstruction [8]. Chest CT scans typically show an endobronchial mass, with or without bronchial dilatation, and air trapping, obstructive pneumonia, or atelectasis [2,4]. Wang et al. [9] reported that low-grade PMEC is often located in the central bronchial or trachea, with smooth and well-defined margins, oval or lobular in shape, and markedly ho­ mogeneously enhancing; high-grade PMEC tends to be peripheral, with ill-defined margins, lobular, and heterogeneous, with reduced enhancement. High-grade PMEC can be difficult to differentiate from bronchial carcinoid tumors due to the hypervascularity of the tumor on CT images [6].
Bronchoscopy is commonly used to define the localization and obtain a biopsy for a definitive diagnosis. Macroscopically, PMEC cells include mucous, epidermoid, and intermediate cells, lacking in keratinization

[10]. The extracellular spaces are formed by the tumor cells and contain a mucoid substance [9]. High-grade tumors have increased nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, and cellular necrosis but reduced mucoid substances and vessels compared with low-grade PMEC [9].
Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for patients with PMEC [11]. Multiple surgical approaches can be utilized, including lo­ bectomy, segmental resection, or endoscopic removal, depending on the location and the extension of the tumor [11]. Adjuvant therapy is not indicated for cases of low-grade PMEC with complete resection [4]. No evidence currently supports the efficacy of chemotherapy or radio­ therapy against high-grade PMEC, although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy has been suggested for unresectable or high-grade PMEC [12]. Low-grade PMEC is associated with a good prognosis and a 5-year survival rate of up to 95%, whereas high-grade PMEC is associated with a worse prognosis [3,10].
The patient in this article was a child who presented with respiratory tract obstruction symptoms and had been misdiagnosed with asthma for a long time. After complete tumor resection, the histological results revealed a low-grade PMEC; therefore, the patient was not indicated to receive adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The symptoms of res­ piratory obstruction were completely solved by tumor removal.
4. Conclusion
Children who present with PMEC are rare, and the symptoms are often similar to other lung diseases, leading to delayed diagnosis. Chest CT scans may help determine the cause and exclude differential di­ agnoses, such as asthma and pneumonia. Most PMEC cases have a good prognosis, and a timely diagnosis and treatment may improve the overall survival rate of the patient.
