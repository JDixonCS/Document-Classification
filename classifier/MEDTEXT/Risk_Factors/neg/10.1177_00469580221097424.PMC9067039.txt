Abstract Background and Objective: Despite that inherited (thalassemia and SCA) and infectious (hepatitis B, hepatitis C and AIDs) diseases and their risk factor consanguineous marriage are widespread among Yemen population, community-based awareness studies towards premarital screening (PMS) is extremely limited, so our study is designed to elicit knowledge and attitude of engaged and recently married couples in Taiz (Yemen) toward PMS. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to September 2021 at Taiz. A well-structured questionnaire was designed and then delivered to participants to collect data. Results: The results revealed that majority of respondents (83.60%-94.18%) had knowledge about inherited and infectious diseases, respectively, and educational institution was the main knowledge source. Females had significantly higher knowledge than males (P  .01), except about AIDs since no difference (P = .539). The results also revealed that majority of respondents had positive attitudes toward PMS, except toward AIDs testing since 70% of males and 68.91% of females had negative attitudes. The majority of respondents agreed that screening reduces the diseases incidence. Approximately half of respondents (50.79%56.61%) tend to go ahead for marriage in case of positive results for inherited and infectious diseases respectively. Making PMS as an obligatory step prior engagement was agreed by 47.62% of respondents (45.71% of males, 48.74% of females). Conclusion: A high level of knowledge and positive attitudes toward inherited and infectious diseases and PMS were reported. This knowledge reflected on the agreement of majority of respondents regarding PMS importance in term of reduction of diseases incidence.

Introduction
Hemoglobinopathies and different types of infectious diseases are common in many Arab countries and accounted to be as causes of morbidity and mortality globally.1-4 according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the carrier rates of major congenital diseases vary and common in the Eastern Mediterranean countries; alpha thalassemia (2-50%), beta thalassemia (2-7%) and sickle cell anemia (.3 and 30%).5 The Centre for Arab Genomic Studies reported that SCA and thalassemia are 2 of the 906 genetic diseases, which are endemic to Arab countries.6 in Yemen, the prevalence of sickle cell trait (Hb AS) and b-thalassemia trait is 2.2% and 4.4% with an estimated incidence of 20/10,000 and 11.3/ 10,000 of homozygous (Hb SS) and b-thalassemia respectively births.7-9 The consanguineous marriage is the main predictor and risk factor of genetic diseases,5,10 in the most Eastern Mediterranean countries the consanguinity rate is high and vary between 20-50%.5 The prevalence of consanguineous marriages among Yemeni people is 40%, of them 58% between the first cousins; furthermore its rate is increasing in the last marriage groups.11 The treatment of genetic and infectious diseases are expensive and lead to a considerable stress for patients and their relatives; in addition to economical burdens on the health system, so the premarital screening is the best intervention that would help in diseases controlling and prevention12,13 and thus the premarital screening is mandatory for prospective couples in in 8 Middle Eastern countries.1,14,15
To the best of our knowledge, no research study has been published addressing the knowledge and attitudes of engaged couples and recently married toward PMS and its consequences in Taiz. Knowledge and attitudes are the primary determinants that can help in reducing the incidence of inherited and infectious diseases. Thus, our community study is designed to elicit knowledge and attitude of engaged couples and recently married toward premarital screening and its consequences.
Materials and Methods
Study Design and Sampling: This is a cross-sectional study conducted from April to September 2021 in Taiz town, Yemen. 189 subjects were voluntary participated in this study. Taiz is one of the largest cities located in the central and southwestern of Yemen (44.01° E, 13.34° N), 280 km south of the capital Sana'a along the Red Sea coast overlooking the Bab Al-Mandab (about 1311 m above sea level).16 This study including; design, setting, analyses and reporting, was in

consistency to the guidelines of STROBE and criteria of the cross-sectional study.17
Data Collection: A well-structured questionnaire was designed and then distributed to collect the data. This questionnaire was mainly divided into 3 parts; Part 1: sociodemographic data about the study subject including age, gender, educational level, marital status, and income level. Part 2: knowledge of the subject about the inherited and infectious diseases that are related to PMS as well his information sources about these diseases. Part 3: attitude of subject toward conducting screening for genetic and infectious diseases as well his attitude toward screening results.
Data Analysis: SPSS (version 21) software program was recruited for data analysis. Descriptive statistics were performed for to know the characteristics of the study participants. Independent-Samples T Tests were conducted to compare the variables between the male and female groups. One-Way ANOVATests were done to the variables with more than two-level. The Odds Ratios (ORs) was calculated to determine for knowledge and attitudes of respondents by gender.
Results
Socio-demographic characteristics of study subjects: 220 questionnaires were delivered to the study subjects, but only 189 of them were adequately filled and returned the questionnaires to the response rate became 86%. The number of females participated in this study were more than males; 119 (62%) vs 70 (38%). The most of the respondents were more younger where 78.8% (104 females, 45 males) were aged 1525 years while 21.2% (15 females, 25 males) were aged 26-35 years; Table 1. The marital status of the most study participants were betrothed (who are in the initial step before getting married and officially not married according to Islamic culture) with 59.8% in comparison to the recently married subjects (who get married not more than 5 years ago) 20.6% and engaged subjects (who are in the last step before getting married and officially married according to Islamic culture) 19.6%. According to the education level, no differences between males and females but there was a significant difference in their income (P = .004). 48.7% of the participants are engaged or get married from their relatives and 45% are cousin's parents. The results showed that no differences between males and females regarding their relativity to their partners as well as between their parents. Most of the respondents (68.9%) have no inherited diseases in their family and (73.5%) of them didn't screen for inherited diseases, in the same trend, majority of the respondents (87.8%) have no infectious diseases and (56.1%) of them didn't screen for infectious diseases
Knowledge of study respondents about diseases related to premarital screening: The awareness of the study respondents about reported inherited and infectious diseases were very high (83.60-94.18%); Table 2. The females could be more

likely to have higher knowledge about the thalassemia and SCA more than male by 3.32 and 7.02 times with a significantly difference P = .004 and <.001 respectively; Table 2. As well, The females could be more likely to have higher knowledge about the inherited hepatitis B and hepatitis C more than male by 4.29 and 8.63 times with a significantly difference since P values equals .005 and <.001 respectively while no significantly difference between females and males in their knowledge about the AIDs (P = .539).
Attitudes of the study respondents towards PMS for related diseases: The results revealed that the majority of the respondents from either males (74.29%- 82.86%) or females (61.34%-68.91%) appeared to have positive attitudes (accept) towards testing for all studied diseases except AIDs, where the majority of respondents (70% of males, 68.91% of females) appeared to have negative attitudes (refuse) for AIDs testing (Table 2). As deduced from the results, the males could be more likely to have a positive attitude for thalassemia testing more than females by 3.05 times with a significantly difference P = .002, while no apparent significant difference between males and females regarding testing for the other diseases reported in the Table 2.

Sources of knowledge about inherited disease (Thalassemia and SCA): The knowledge of the respondents about the inherited disease (thalassemia and SCA) is coming from different sources shown in the Figure 1; it's clear that the educational institutions are ranked on the top and were the main source knowledge about thalassemia and SCA for the majority with 22-21 (42.2%) out of 51 males and 67-63 (60.7%) out of 107 females. Family and friends were equally ranked and were the second source (19.6%) of males while only the family was the second source for females (14.5%), followed by the social media source (11.2%) of females. The social media was the fourth source for males (10.7%) while friend was the fourth source for females (10.3%). The health care providers and culturalscientific journals were the last sources.
Sources of knowledge about infectious diseases (Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and AIDs): The knowledge of the respondents about the infectious diseases (Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and AIDs) is coming from different sources shown in the Figure 2; it's clear that the educational institutions are ranked on the top and were the main source knowledge about Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and AIDs for the majority with 26, 24 and 29

contrary, males (60%) could be more likely to go ahead for marriage in case of positive results more than females (45.38%) by 1.8 times but with no significant difference (P = .07). The results also revealed that the two-third of males (68.57%) will not feel with anxious or depression in case of positive results, oppositely with a significant difference (P = .001), the large proportion of females (56.3%) will feel with that. Both males and females showed similar attitudes and trends regarding making these screening as an obligatory step before marriage; since 45.71% of males and 48.74% of females accepted that condition while 54.29% of males and 51.26% of females rejected that.
The attitudes of the study subjects regarding the consequences of screening for infectious diseases are presented in a Table 3; the majority of bot males (65.71%) and females (73.11%) appeared to have a positive response regarding the importance of screening for the infectious diseases that lead to decrease the incidence of these diseases. The result showed that attitudes of males are equally oriented and to a less extent females as well regarding notify of their partners in case of the result of the testing for the infectious diseases is positive. The large proportion of females (61.34%) will notify their families if the result of the testing for the infectious diseases is positive, oppositely with a significant difference (P = .024), the large proportion of males (55.71%) will not notify. The results also revealed that the two-third of males (68.57%) will

not feel with anxious or depression in case of positive results, oppositely with a significant difference (P = .004), the 53.78% of females will feel with that. Interestingly, less than half of males (44.29%) will disconnect with their families and others in case of positive results, while the large proportion of males (63.87%) will disconnect, with a significant difference (P = .010).
Discussion
This study investigated the knowledge and attitudes of engaged and recently get married couples towards the premarital screening for specific inherited and infectious diseases as well consequences of this screening. The awareness about reported inherited and infectious diseases were very high (83.60-94.18%) among study respondents. Females had significantly higher knowledge about the inherited (thalassemia and SCA) and infectious (hepatitis B and hepatitis C) diseases, only about AIDs there was no significantly difference among gender, at the same trend, a study was conducted at 2011 on Omani adults reported that the awareness towards SCA was high (83.8%) and was towards thalassemia (55.3%).18 Our results were in a good agreement regarding awareness about thalassemia, where female's awareness was higher than males, but oppositely to our result regarding awareness about SCA where Omani study indicated

Almoliky et al.

that male's awareness was higher than females.18 In 2017, a cross-sectional study on male Saudi (Jazan) was reported that
41.3% had an average knowledge about SCA, 41.3% had good knowledge and 17.4% of them had poor knowledge,19 a
reasonable level of knowledge about genetic diseases was reported among university students in Jeddah.20 A survey among university students in Jordon showed that students had
a lack of knowledge about PMS-related diseases, although they had an adequate knowledge about PMS itself.21
The results revealed that the majority of the respondents
either males (74.29%- 82.86%) or females (61.34%-68.91%)
appeared to have positive attitudes (accept) towards testing
for inherited diseases (Thalassemia and SCA) and infectious
diseases (Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C), in contrast, the majority of respondents (70% of males, 68.91% of females)
appeared to have negative attitudes (refuse) for AIDs testing,
this may due to cultural and ethics aspects and highly costeffectiveness.22 Our study results also revealed that males had
positive attitudes for thalassemia testing more than females with a significantly difference, while no difference between males and females regarding testing for the other inherited
and infectious diseases. a Saudi studies reported that approximately 80% of the respondents would like to have PMS23 and almost all unmarried female students (99.0%) agreed on the importance of PMS.24 A more recent study
among male Saudi (Jazan) showed that 95.2% of them favored of doing screening for SCA.19 Syrian students had an
overall positive attitude toward PMS, but in certain aspects they don't.25 According to the recent study, 87.8% of young Jordanian adults had a positive attitude toward premarital genetic screening.
Regarding the importance of PMS; the majority of the
respondents agreed that screening reduces the incidence of
the inherited and infectious diseases; this result is consistent
with many previous studies conducted in Arab countries; in a
cross-sectional study conducted on medical students of Sana'a university found that vast majority of the respondents (92%) believed that PMS is important and it reduces the inherited and sexually transmitted diseases,26 A similar view
has obtained from a Saudi study where 94.3% of the study
subjects accept that PMS is an effective tool to prevent genetic diseases,27 another Suadi study conducted on students
of King Abdulaziz University (KAU) in Jeddah reported that
95% of them believed that PMS limit the spread of inherited disease,28 another more recent Saudi study indicated that
majority of participants (94% agreed that PMS reduces the incidence of some inherited diseases and sexually transmitted diseases29 a similar result obtained from Oman studies that
90.3% of respondents aware the potential of PMS to limit the spread of inherited diseases,18 and 94.3% of participants believed PMS to be important30 as well 80% of subjects
residing in UAE believed in the importance of genetic testing.31 In fact, the effectiveness of PMS in term of re-
duction the diseases incidence have been reported in many countries including Turkey, Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan where

decreasing in B-thalassemia birth was of approximately 90, 80, and 65% respectively.32
