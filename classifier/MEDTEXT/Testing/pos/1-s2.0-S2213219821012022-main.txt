60 Abstract 61 Background 62 It remains unclear if patients with AR and/or asthma are susceptible to COVID-19 infection, 63 severity and mortality. 64 Objective
Journal Pre-proof 65 To investigate the role of AR and/or asthma in COVID-19 infection, severity, and mortality,
66 and assess whether long-term AR and/or asthma medications affected the outcomes of COVID67 19. 68 Methods 69 Demographic and clinical data of 70,557 adult participants completed SARS-Cov-2 testing 70 between March 16 and December 31, 2020 in the UK Biobank were analyzed. The rates of 71 COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and mortality in relation to preexisting AR and/or asthma 72 were assessed based on adjusted generalized linear models. We further analyzed the impact of 73 long-term AR and/or asthma medications on the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and 74 mortality. 75 Results 76 AR patients of all ages had lower positive rates of SARS-Cov-2 tests (RR:0.75, 95% CI: 0.6977 0.81, p<0.001), with lower susceptibility in males (RR: 0.74, 95%CI: 0.65-0.85, p<0.001) than 78 females (RR: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.72-0.9, p<0.001). However, similar effects of asthma against 79 COVID-19 hospitalization were only major in participants aged <65 (RR:0.93, 95% CI: 0.8680 1, p=0.044) instead of elderlies. In contrast, asthma patients tested positively had higher risk
3

81 of hospitalization (RR:1.42, 95% CI: 1.32-1.54, p<0.001). Neither AR nor asthma had impact

82 on COVID-19 mortality. None of conventional medications for AR or asthma, e.g.,

83 antihistamines, corticosteroids or 2 adrenoceptor agonists showed association with COVID-

84 19 infection or severity.

85 Conclusion

Journal Pre-proof 86

AR (all ages) and asthma (aged<65) act as protective factors against COVID-19 infection,

87 while asthma increase risk for COVID-19 hospitalization. None of the long-term medications

88 had significant association with infection, severity and mortality of COVID-19 among patients

89 with AR and/or asthma.

108 Highlight Box 109 What is already known about this topic? 110 In different studies, whether asthma and allergic rhinitis acting as independent risk factors for 111 COVID-19 remains controversial. 112 What does this article add to our knowledge? 113 AR (all ages) and asthma (aged<65) act as protective factors against COVID-19 infection, 114 while asthma increase the risk for hospitalization. None of the long-term medications had 115 significant association with infection, severity and mortality of COVID-19 among patients with 116 AR and/or asthma. 117 How does this study impact current management guidelines 118 We provided new insights on the association between allergic diseases and COVID-19 119 prevalence and outcomes. We suggested more attention should be paid to the education and 120 primary care of elderly asthmatic patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including active 121 treatment of comorbidities.

122 Introduction

123 The emergence of COVID-19 has had a huge impact on population health globally. As of

124 May 9th, 2021, there have been more than 157 million confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide

125 and over 3.2 million deaths were attributed to the pandemic (https://covid19.who.int./). It has

126 been reported that some underlying diseases such as dementia, pneumonia, depression, diabetes,

Journal Pre-proof 127 atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension[1], as well

128 as high cytokine, lactate dehydrogenase level[2] and ages could affect the prevalence and

129 outcomes of COVID-19.

130

Allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma are common and underestimated respiratory diseases

131 and often simultaneously occur as united airway disease[3-5]. Whether AR and asthma acting as

132 independent risk factor for the infection, hospitalization and mortality of COVID-19 remains

133 controversial. It was reported that AR/asthma patients were often exacerbated by viral

134 respiratory infections[6, 7]. A Korean nationwide cohort study reported that AR and asthma

135 increased the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19[8]. On the contrary, other reports

136 suggested that asthma did not pose a threat to the diagnosis and severity of COVID-19[9-12].

137 Moreover, some meta-analyses even concluded that asthma was considered as an independent

138 protective factor for the death of patients with COVID-19[13-15].

139

Our current study aimed to explore the role of AR and/or asthma in the risk of infection,

140 severity and mortality of COVID-19 based on a large prospective cohort in UK Biobank, and

141 to evaluate whether long-term medications for AR and/or asthma would affect the clinical

142 manifestation and outcomes of COVID-19.

143 Methods

144 Database information

145

UK Biobank (UKB) is a national prospective cohort with very large and detailed data from

146 over 500,000 participants aged 40-69 years when recruited at baseline (in 2006-2010), which

147 ensured a wide distribution across all exposures to provide reliable associations between

Journal Pre-proof 148 personal characteristics and health outcomes[16]. SARS-Cov-2 testing results data were offered

149 to UKB by Public Health England (PHE). UK Biobank ethical approval was from the North

150 West Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee. The current analysis was approved under the

151 UKB application (Applicant Number: 69718).

152 Study population

153

UKB participants with matching SARS-Cov-2 results (whether reported as positive or

154 negative for SARS-Cov-2) tested between March 16th 2020 and December 31st, 2020 in

155 England were examined. We excluded individuals with 1) who died before the pandemic (set

156 as February 1st, 2020); 2) whose location belonged to UKB assessment centers in Scotland and

157 Wales (where no SARS-CoV-2 testing data were available); and 3) who were diagnosed with

158 AR and/or asthma after February 1st, 2020, which was set as the beginning of the pandemic[1].

159 Exposure variables and covariables

160

AR was defined as either self-reported AR history from baseline questionnaires or the

161 International Classification of Diseases codes (ICD-10 codes: J30.1, J30.2, J30.3, J30.4; or

162 ICD-9 codes: 460,477). Asthma was defined as either self-reported asthma history from

163 baseline questionnaires or ICD codes (ICD-10 codes: J45; or ICD-9 codes: 493).

7

164

Medication data of UK Biobank participants were available from a verbal interview by a

165 trained nurse on prescription medications including type and number of medications. The long-

166 term medications were defined as regular medications taken weekly and monthly, as opposed

167 to the short-term medications. We summarized different types of medications such as

168 antihistamine, glucocorticoids, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and 2 adrenoceptor agonists

Journal Pre-proof 169 according to their coding in Table E1.

170

Covariables included gender, age, Townsend deprivation index, education, body mass

171 index (BMI), ethnic background, smoking status, alcohol drinking status, current employment

172 status and preexisting comorbidities[1, 17]. Age was defined as baseline age plus the duration of

173 interval before inclusion. Preexisting comorbidities considered in this study included cancer

174 diagnosed by doctor (self-report in questionnaires), fracture resulting from simple fall (self-

175 report in questionnaires), diabetes mellitus (ICD-10 codes E10, E11, E12, E13, E14), chronic

176 diseases of the circulatory system (ICD-10 codes I05-I09, I10-I15, I20-I25, I26-I28, I60-I69),

177 chronic lower respiratory diseases (ICD-10 codes J40, J41, J42, J43, J44, J47 or ICD-9 codes

178 490, 491, 492, 496, 494), diseases of esophagus, stomach and duodenum (ICD-10 codes K20,

179 K21, K25, K26, K27, K28, K29, K30 or ICD-9 codes 530, 531, 532, 533, 534, 535, 5368),

180 renal failure (ICD-10 codes N17, N18, N19 or ICD-9 codes 584, 585), dementia (ICD-10 codes

181 F00, F01, F02, F03, G30 or ICD-9 codes 2901), liver disease (K72 Hepatic failure, not

182 elsewhere classified, K74, 5712, 5715, 5716 fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver), arthritis (ICD-10

183 codes M00, M01, M02, M03, M05, M06, M07, M08, M09, M10, M11, M12, M13, M14) and

184 certain immune disorders (ICD-10 codes D80, D81, D82, D83, D84, D86, D89). However, due

8

185 to the limited number of patients who had liver diseases (n=609, less than 1%), we excluded

186 liver disease when doing the adjustment.

187 Outcomes

188

The definition of COVID-19 infection referred to at least one positive testing result of

189 SARS-CoV-2. When exploring the severity and mortality of COVID-19, we focused on the

Journal Pre-proof 190 participants who had confirmed COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2-positive patients who progressed

191 to hospitalization were considered as "severe COVID-19"[10]. To identify patients died of

192 COVID-19, we used mortality data provided by UK Biobank using the ICD10 identifier of

193 U07.1 (underlying COVID-19 cause of death).

194 Statistics analyses

195

Continuous variables were presented as mean and standard deviation (SD), and categorical

196 variables were presented as frequencies and percentages. Student's t-test was used for

197 continuous variable comparisons and chi-square test for categorical variable comparisons in

198 order to assess the differences among groups. Generalized linear models (robust Poisson model)

199 were generated to evaluate the correlation of AR and/or asthma with COVID-19 outcomes

200 (including prevalence, hospitalization rate and mortality), shown as relative risks (RRs) and

201 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Smoking status consisted of two variables: smoking

202 experience, categorized as current, former, and never smoker; and pack year, defined as the

203 product of the average number of cigarette packs (regular size, 20 cigarettes) smoked per day

204 and the total number of years smoked. According to the variable distribution, observation value

205 and association of smoking participants[18], multiple imputation using chained equations that

9

206 provided multiple predictions for each missing value had been conducted to impute the missing

207 data of smoking pack year (n=11,391).

208

Four models were constructed according to the adjustments of factors: i. Model* was a

209 univariate model without adjustment; ii. Model** adjusted gender and age additionally; iii.

210 Model*** was further adjusted for potential confounders, including Townsend deprivation

Journal Pre-proof 211 index, education, current employment status, BMI, ethnic background, smoking and drinking

212 status; iv. Model**** added preexisting comorbidities mentioned above as adjustments based

213 on Model***. Above four models were analyzed simultaneously for AR group, asthma group,

214 AR and asthma group, respectively, and the reference was the healthy control group for all

215 relevant analyses.

216

Medication analyses were conducted for participants who had either AR or asthma, and

217 participants who had AR or asthma but never used those medicines served as the controls in

218 corresponding analysis.

219

For subgroup analyses, Model**** was constructed for participants stratified by gender

220 (female or male), age (< 65 or 65 years old), BMI (30 or >30), ethnic background (white

221 or non-white) and smoking (never, previous or current). Preexisting dementia was reported to

222 be associated with dramatically increasing risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and death (OR =

223 7.30)[1] due to the APOE e4 genotype[19], hence sensitivity analysis was conducted for

224 participants without dementia to assess the robustness of our results.

225

In order to conduct a more in-depth analysis for asthma, asthma participants were further

226 divided into allergic asthma and non-allergic asthma groups, and the Model**** was applied

10

227 for the sub-analysis. Allergic asthma was defined as asthma with any allergic disease (hayfever,

228 allergy rhinitis or eczema, defined as ICD-10 codes: L20 and J30.1-J30.4 or self-report in

229 questionnaires)[10], and non-allergic asthma referred to asthma without any allergic disease. The

230 reference was healthy control group without asthma or allergic diseases. In another sub-

231 analysis, we explored the differences in the outcomes of COVID-19 between asthma patients

Journal Pre-proof 232 with/without COPD (COPD was defined as the following ICD-10 codes: J43, J44 or self-

233 report in questionnaires) and participants without asthma or COPD (reference group).

234

All analyses were performed by R 3.6.3 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria), and

235 P < 0.05 was considered for statistical significance.

11

236 Results

237 Patient characteristics

238

As shown in Table 1 and Table E2, there were 70,557 participants tested SARS-CoV-2,

239 and 15,690 of them had at least one SARS-CoV-2 positive test. Among them, 4,915 patients

240 were hospitalized due to the COVID-19, and 636 patients died of COVID-19. For analysis, we

Journal Pre-proof 241 classified all participants into four groups of AR only (n=3,201), asthma only (n=8,624), AR

242 and asthma (n=1,407), and control (neither AR nor asthma, n=57,325). The mean age of

243 COVID-19 patients was 64.4 years, versus 68.7 years for those with non-COVID-19. Similarly,

244 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (mean age: 68 years vs. 62.8 years of non-hospitalized

245 patients) or COVID-19-related death (mean age: 74 years vs. 64 years of non-death patients)

246 were more likely to occur in the older participants than the younger, respectively.

247 The effect of AR and asthma on the infection of COVID-19

248

As shown in Table 2 and Figure 1, AR represented a protective effect against COVID-19

249 infection (RR: 0.75, 95%CI: 0.69-0.81, p<0.001), and this benefit was consistently observed

250 (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.71-0.85, p<0.001) after adjustment for gender, age, Townsend

251 deprivation index, education, current employment status, BMI, ethnic background, smoking

252 status and alcohol drinking status, and preexisting comorbidities by Model****. The protective

253 effect of AR on COVID-19 infection was similar if patients had comorbid asthma (RR: 0.81,

254 95% CI: 0.73-0.92, p=0.001). However, the protective effect of asthma alone against the

255 COVID-19 infection was not significant after adjustment (RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91-1.01,

256 p=0.109). Table E3 reported the association of AR and/or asthma with COVID-19 infection,

12

257 hospitalization and mortality, after adjustment for different covariates.

258 The effect of AR and asthma on the severity and mortality of COVID-19

259

As shown in Table 2, among those participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 test, AR did not

260 significantly affect the hospitalization rate of COVID-19 after covariate adjustments (RR: 0.95,

261 95% CI: 0.79-1.13, p=0.548). On the contrary, asthma was a risk factor for the COVID-19

Journal Pre-proof 262 hospitalization (RR: 1.1, 95% CI: 1.01-1.19, p=0.032). Neither AR nor asthma had a significant

263 effect on COVID-19 mortality after covariate adjustments for Townsend deprivation index,

264 education, employment, BMI, ethnic background, smoking status, drinking status and

265 preexisting comorbidities.

266 The effects of long-term medications for AR and/or asthma on infection, hospitalization

267 and mortality of COVID-19.

268

We summarized four main long-term medication types that patients commonly used for

269 control symptoms of AR or asthma, including 2 adrenoceptor agonists, antihistamine,

270 systemic glucocorticoids, and corticosteroid nasal sprays (CNS). As shown in Table 3 and

271 Figure 2, due to the limited sample size (Table E4), none of these medications showed

272 significant impact on infection, severity and mortality of COVID-19 among patients with AR

273 and/or asthma.

274

We further conducted subgroup analyses for the most commonly used types of CNS

275 (beclomethasone and fluticasone propionate), short-acting 2 adrenoceptor agonists (SABA)

276 and long-acting 2 adrenoceptor agonists (LABA), shown in Table E5. However, due to the

277 limited number of COVID-19 patients taking certain medicines chronically, none of these were

13

278 associated with the infection, hospitalization or mortality of COVID-19 after adjustments for
279 other covariates (p>0.05). 280 Subgroup analyses for different clinical factors potentially affecting the infection and 281 severity of COVID-19

282

As shown in Table E6, we evaluated the effects of different covariates on the infection,

Journal Pre-proof 283 severity and mortality of COVID-19. Our results revealed that preexisting comorbidities (such

284 as dementia, circulatory diseases, etc) were important variables that affecting the infection and

285 severity of COVID-19 (Model****).

286

We further carried out multivariable subgroup analyses for the factors of gender, age, BMI,

287 ethnics and smoking status to explore their individual effects on the infection and severity of

288 COVID-19 (Table E7). With respect to COVID-19 infection and hospitalization, it was worth

289 noting that when stratified participants by ages, asthma demonstrated a potential protective

290 effect against COVID-19 infection in younger participants (aged<65 years, RR: 0.93, 95% CI:

291 0.86-1, p=0.044), but this effect on the elderly participants was not significant (aged65

292 years,RR:1.02, 95% CI: 0.95-1.1, p=0.59). Compared with those never or previous smokers,

293 current smokers with AR and asthma had a higher risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization

294 (RR:1.98, 95% CI: 1-3.9, p=0.049). 295 Sub-analyses for Patients with Asthma

296

We further compared the differences in COVID-19 infection/outcomes between patients

297 with allergic and non-allergic asthma (Table E8) and between asthma patients with and without

298 COPD (Table E9), respectively. No significant difference between allergic and non-allergic

299 asthma was observed in our results. In line with the above results, both of them reduced the

14

300 infection risk of COVID-19, while neither of them presented significant association with the

301 COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality. Asthma patients without COPD had a slightly

302 protective effect against COVID-19 infection, but such patients had an increased

303 hospitalization risk of COVID-19.

304

305 Sensitivity Analysis

Journal Pre-proof 306

Some studies have shown that dementia had a striking association with COVID-19 related

307 hospitalizations and deaths[1]. We therefore performed sensitivity analyses by excluding

308 participants with preexisting dementia (n=1,876) to evaluate the robustness of our results

309 (Table E10). We observed consistent results that participants with AR (with/without asthma)

310 had lower risk of COVID-19 infection, however, asthma patients with positive SARS-CoV-2

311 had higher risk of progression to hospitalized COVID-19.

312 313

314 Discussion

315

After evaluating 70,557 participants in UKB, our results showed that AR was a major

316 protective factor from infecting COVID-19 after covariate adjustments. Asthma also showed a

317 weak association with lower COVID-19 infection risk although it did not reach a statistical

318 significance. It is noteworthy that this trend of asthma on COVID-19 infection was driven

Journal Pre-proof 319 primarily in younger participants (aged<65 years), but not in the elderly participants (aged

320 65 years). Nonetheless, having a diagnosis of asthma was associated with a greater chance of

321 COVID-19 hospitalization across all ages, even after covariate adjustments, whereas AR had

322 no impact on COVID-19 hospitalizations. Although it is hard to make firm conclusions due to

323 the limited number of deaths related to COVID-19, neither AR nor asthma was associated with

324 COVID-19 mortality. None of the long-term medications for AR/asthma had some effects on

325 the infection, hospitalization and mortality of COVID-19 after covariate adjustments.

326

We consider the reason why patients with AR (of all ages) or asthma (among younger

327 participants) were associated with lower positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 test results. Angiotensin-

328 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for the attachment and entry of SARS-CoV-2 into

329 the host cells[20]. It has been reported that allergen provocation of respiratory tract would induce

330 allergic airway inflammation which resulted in a decrease of ACE-2 expression, indicating that

331 allergic inflammation may of great relevance to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection[11, 21, 22].

332 In addition, allergen-specific T cells may recruit a faster and more efficient memory-type

333 response to deal with heterologous SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, which may provide significant

334 advantages for patients with allergic diseases[23, 24]. However, this protective effect of asthma

16

335 on COVID-19 infection was mainly observed in patients who were younger than 65 years in

336 our study. The exact reason is unclear but we speculated that it might attribute to the decline in

337 lung function and immunity with age[25], which could lead to poorer prognoses[26, 27].

338

It is interesting that AR and asthma exhibited distinct effects on COVID-19 hospitalization

339 in our study, of which asthma was a risk factor while the influence of AR was not statistically
Journal Pre-proof 340 notable. One potential reason is that SARS-CoV-2 impacts the lung parenchyma, so the
341 additional impact of lower airway disease with asthma (and not with AR) could lead to a 342 synergistically worsened clinical condition (i.e. rapid deterioration)[28], further, asthma patients 343 may have more pulmonary comorbidities which affect the disease outcomes. By contrast, AR 344 (upper airways) is a disease more confined to the nose. Consistent with the findings here, some 345 studies have also proposed that if SARS-CoV-2 succeeded to establish clinical manifestations 346 in patients with asthma, the risk of disease progression is higher[23]. The possible reasons given 347 in these studies are as the following: 1) respiratory viruses provoke the local inflammatory 348 cascades processed by T-lymphocyte trafficking, and induce the disruption of the bronchial 349 defense system activated by resident monocytes[29]. 2) respiratory viruses can change the

350 composition of the airway microbiota and promote the growth of pathogens which may

351 contribute to asthma exacerbations[30].(3) decreased antiviral function of eosinophils during

352 respiratory viral infections in asthmatic patients may have a potential impact on virus-induced

353 asthma exacerbations[31].

354

Bloom et al. analyzed the data from Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK)

355 study and revealed that compared with patients without asthma, asthma patients with COVID-

17

356 19 were more likely to receive critical care during hospitalization[32]. Several independent

357 studies have observed a potential association between asthma phenotypes and COVID-19-

358 related outcomes. According to the results of Zhu et al., nonallergic asthma was significantly

359 associated with severe COVID-19, while allergic asthma had no statistically significant

360 association with severe COVID-19. They also reported that this significant association

Journal Pre-proof 361 persisted regardless of whether asthma patients had COPD or not[10]. However, we did not

362 observe such differences between allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. Although our research data

363 came from the same UK Biobank database, the confounders we adjusted for and the

364 populations we included were different. In our current study, we excluded participants who did

365 not have SARS-cov-2 testing results, while these participants were considered as SARS-cov-2

366 negative in their study.

367

Another English cohort study (QResearch database) reported that COVID-19 patients with

368 COPD or asthma had an increased risk of hospitalization and death[33]. However, our results

369 did not observe such trends, mainly due to the different population cohort we studied. Another

370 Chinese study indicated that COPD and asthma were both important risk factors for poor

371 clinical outcomes (such as needing invasive ventilation, admission to the intensive care unit,

372 or death within 30 days after hospitalization) in patients with COVID-19[34]. In contrast, our

373 results showed statistically significant relationships only between the hospitalization rate of

374 COVID-19 and asthma comorbidity.

375

The effect of glucocorticoid on the risk of susceptibility, severity and mortality of COVID-

376 19 was controversial. Recent studies reported that glucocorticoid such as ciclesonide might

18

377 decrease the risk of susceptibility of COVID-19[35-37]. However, our results did not observe that

378 long-term use of antihistamine, systemic glucocorticoids or glucocorticoid nasal sprays was

379 beneficial to the COVID-19 infection or prognosis. Similarly, Aveyard et al. reported that the

380 use of glucocorticoids was not associated with the severity of COVID-19[33]. And Schultze et

381 al. also reported that long-term use of glucocorticoids would not reduce COVID-19-related

Journal Pre-proof 382 mortality in patients with asthma or COPD[38].

383

Although the advent of our study provided new insights into the association between

384 allergic diseases and the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19, a few limitations still existed.

385 First, the UKB may have a healthy volunteer selection bias in participants subgroups who were

386 older, female, or lived in less socioeconomically deprived areas[39]. Second, the sample size for

387 assessing COVID-19 related mortality in AR/asthma patients who had taken long-term

388 medications was very small (126/2624), limiting our study power to detect differences related

389 to medication use. Third, comorbidity data of participants were obtained from the baseline

390 interviews and hospitalization information, but the current status of diseases remained

391 unknown; the impact on our association is unknown, as some patients could have already taken

392 off medications once remission has been achieved, while others had flare ups of their disease

393 during the pandemic period. Fourthly, we have to use an imperfect surrogate for severity of

394 COVID-19, namely COVID-19 hospitalizations, knowing that some patients with severe

395 diseases may have been assumed to have COVID-19 infection and not tested, while some

396 hospitalizations may have been misclassified due to other major disorders rather than COVID-

397 19. Finally, our analyses did not take into account changes in participant behaviour. It is thus

19

398 still possible that participants with AR or younger asthmatic patients were either more careful

399 about their own COVID-19 exposures or more afraid to present with COVID-19-like

400 symptoms, and therefore were more likely to wear masks or adhere to social distancing.

401

In summary, AR (in all ages) is associated with lower rates of COVID-19 infection, but

402 not with the severity and mortality of COVID-19. Similar protective effect in asthma patients,
Journal Pre-proof 403 whatever allergic asthma or non-allergic asthma is observed only in those aged less than 65
404 years, but not in the elderlies (aged 65 years). In asthmatic patients with confirmed COVID405 19, there is a higher risk of hospitalization than healthy controls.
