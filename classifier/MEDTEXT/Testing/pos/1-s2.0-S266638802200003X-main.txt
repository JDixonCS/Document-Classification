Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems, which are representative genome editing technologies, are classified into class 1 and class 2 in terms of evolutionary biology and are further classified into several subtypes. Class 2 CRISPR systems, including type II Cas9 and type V Cas12a, are the most commonly used for genome editing in eukaryotic cells, while type I CRISPR systems within Class 1 are also becoming available. Type I CRISPR recognizes longer target sequences than CRISPR-Cas9 and can induce large deletion mutations of several kilobases. These features demonstrate its potential as a novel and unique genome editing tool that can induce genetic disruption safely and reliably. Thus, it is expected to be utilized for gene therapy and industrial applications. Recently, the DNA cleavage mechanism of type I CRISPR has also revealed details from protein-complex analyses with X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and highspeed atomic force microscopy. The single-strand DNA trans-cleavage activity of type I CRISPR, called collateral activity, has broadened the potential application for CRISPR diagnostics, especially in the development of pointof-care testing methods for COVID-19. In this review, we present an overview of the type I CRISPR system, its application to genome editing, and genetic diagnosis using CRISPR-Cas3.

Introduction
Development of CRISPR-Cas based genome editing
The CRISPR-Cas system is an adaptive immune system mechanism in bacteria and archaea. This immune response functions mainly through adaptation, processing, and interference processes (Fig. 1). In the adaptation process, the Cas protein complex binds to its target DNA sequence next to the short motif, called the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), in a foreign DNA molecule derived from a virus or phage that has infected the bacterium. The complex then cuts off a portion of the target DNA, called the protospacer. The Cas-adaptation complex inserts the protospacer DNA into the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) array to become a spacer. In the processing and interference processes, CRISPR arrays are usually transcribed as a single transcript, called the pre-CRISPR RNA (pre-crRNA). This is then processed into mature CRISPR RNA (crRNA) molecules, which each contain a spacer sequence and part of a flanking repeat. This crRNA typically remains bound to the processing complex (or single protein) and works as a guide to recognize the protospacer (or similar sequence) in the invading genome of the virus or plasmid. The nuclease protein in the complex (or single protein) then cleaves and degrades the foreign DNA molecules [ 1 , 2 ].

Genome editing technology harnessing the interference process of the CRISPR-Cas system is currently the most popular innovative tool for genomic manipulations in eukaryotic cells. CRISPR-Cas9, the most representative tool, works by specifically recognizing and binding to target DNA sequences and introducing double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the genome. These DSBs are mainly repaired by the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology directed repair (HDR) pathways. HDR is a precise repair mechanism that uses homologous donor DNA to fix DNA damage, while NHEJ repairs cleavage sites without the use of homologous sequences and is likely to occur throughout a cell cycle. While the NHEJ pathway provides accurate re-joining, repeated cleavage by Cas9 induces small insertions or deletions (indels) at the cleavage site [3,4]. CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing technology is being applied in various life science and medical fields. Simultaneously, novel genome editing tools with improved safety and efficiency, as well as unique functions, are also being developed [5-7].
Classification of the CRISPR-Cas system
The CRISPR-Cas systems are classified in evolutionary taxonomy as class 1 and class 2, each subdivided into three types (type I, III, IV and type II, V, VI, respectively) [8] (Fig. 1). Class 1 systems use multiple different Cas proteins, while class 2 effectors contain only a single pro-

Fig. 1. Adaptive immune system by the CRISPR-Cas system. This immune response functions mainly through adaptation, processing, and interference processes. Short fragments of invading nucleic acids are captured by adaptive Cas proteins and inserted in the CRISPR array as new spacers. The expressed precursor crRNA from this region is processed into mature crRNAs by the Cas effector protein: Cas6 for types I and III, Cas5d for type I-C, and Csf5 for type IV in class 1. cOA: cyclic oligoadenylate. The CRISPR-Cas effector complexes are then formed. In class 2 systems, type II Cas9 binds and stabilizes the tracrRNA:crRNA duplex and further recruits RNase III for crRNA processing. Type V and type VI effector proteins process nuclease activity for crRNA maturation by themselves. These complexes recognize target sequences that have complementarity with crRNAs and cleave the invading nucleic acids by their respective mechanisms. Several types show collateral cleavage activity to ssDNA or RNA.

tein. In the last decade, single subunit effectors from class 2 CRISPR systems have been widely used for genomic engineering in eukaryotic cells. For example, the CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a systems used for DNA editing are classified as type II and type V, respectively [9-11], while CRISPR-Cas13 used for RNA editing is type VI [12]. New genome editing technologies, such as the miniature CRISPR-Cas12f (Cas14) and CRISPR-Cas12J [13,14], and the CRISPR-associated transposase CAST, have also been successively identified from class 2 type V CRISPR [15]. The single factor needed to function as a genome editing tool is easy to handle, and its small size facilitates delivery to the target cells via DNA vectors, mRNAs, or protein-RNA complexes, making them highly convenient for genomic manipulation.
The class 1 system represents approximately 90% of CRISPR-Cas loci in bacteria, and almost 100% in archaea [16]. Among the class 1 CRISPR, the type I system is the most widespread and functions as a crRNA-bound multiprotein complex, termed CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense (Cascade), with a Cas3 endonuclease that is recruited upon target binding by Cascade and activated to cleave foreign DNAs [1,17].
Type III CRISPR systems are known to cleave both RNA and DNA by effector Csm or Cmr complexes [18]. The recognition of a target mRNA tethers the complex to the transcription locus, resulting in degradation of the RNAs. Several subtypes, such as Type III-A, B, and C, display non-specific single strand DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity, which can induce DNA degradation around the binding sites. At the same time, cyclic oligoadenylates (cOA) are synthesized as a second messenger and acti-

vate CRISPR-Cas associated proteins, like the Csm6/Csx1 RNase family. This results in non-specific RNA cleavage [19,20]. Type IV CRISPR lacks both the adaptive module and nucleases required for interference, and its detailed function is not well understood [21].
These class 1 CRISPR systems, which require the regulation of multiple factors, are difficult to utilize in eukaryotic cells and have not been applied to genome editing tools. However, type I systems are now also emerging as tools for genome and transcriptome manipulation in microbiota [22,23] and eukaryotic cells [24-27]. Furthermore, type I-A and I-E CRISPR exhibits non-specific single strand DNA (ssDNA) cleavage after target recognition in double strand DNA (dsDNA), as well as Cas12a [28,29]. The trans-cleavage activity, called collateral activity, is used in CRISPR-based diagnostics (CRISPR-Dx) as a platform for rapid and sensitive nucleic acid detection, such as in COVID-19 test kits [29-31]. In this review, we focus on the biological characterization of the type I CRISPR system and its application as a genome editing technology for eukaryotic cells and CRISPR-Dx.
Biological characteristics of type I CRISPR systems
Type I systems in the interference process generally consist of effector factors, including the nuclease Cas3 and the multiprotein complexes that comprise the cascade. Depending on the number of cascade proteins and the repeat sequences, seven different subtypes have been defined: I-A, I-B, I-C, I-U, I-D, I-E, and I-F [1,8]. Cascade proteins of the type I

system typically include Cas5, Cas6, Cas7, and Cas8 (Cse1), with some subtypes also presenting Cas4 and/or Cas11 (Cse2) [1,32].
Target recognition by the cascade complex
The type I CRISPR system degrades the target region of dsDNA through two major steps: 1) recognition of target DNA by searching with the cascade complex and 2) cleavage of the DNA by Cas3 nuclease recruitment to the cascade complex [33-41] (Fig. 2).
In the first step, the cascade complex scans the PAM and initiates DNA unwinding [42]. The crRNA then hybridizes with the target DNA strand (TS), which leads to detachment of the non-target strand (NTS) and the formation of a three-stranded nucleic acid structure called an R-loop [34,35,41].
In the cascade complex, Cas6 recognizes the hairpin structure of precrRNA and processes it into the mature crRNA via its RNase activity. Cas5 binds the 5 handle, then multiple Cas7 proteins form the backbone along the crRNA. Cas11 stabilizes the crRNA and target strand DNA loop (R-loop) structure. Cas8 recognizes PAM sequences and recruits Cas3 to a target DNA sequence [43].
PAM sequences are important for the cascade complex to search for target sequences, but even the same CRISPR subtype shows a preference for various PAM sequences in different microorganisms [1,44]. The strength of PAM sequence preference also differs and is promiscuous, making it difficult to experimentally demonstrate a unified sequence. As has been well demonstrated in E. coli-derived I-E, AAG, TAG, GAG, AGG, and ATG are functional PAM sequences, while AAC is functional albeit slightly reduced [44]. The diversity of functional PAM sequences among different Type I CRISPR systems expands the potential for freely designing targets for genome editing with this system, even in regions with high GC or AT content. This will provide the opportunity for many researchers to select the appropriate genome editing tools with Type I CRISPR.
DNA degradation by the cascade-Cas3 complex
Complete formation of the R-loop with the cascade complex induces a conformational change that enables recruitment of Cas3 [45- 47]. Cas3, a protein with a Superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase domain and a histidine-aspartate (HD) nuclease domain, degrades the target DNA in an ATP-dependent manner according to the following steps: nicking the NTS in the R-loop, loading the ssDNA into the helicase domain, and unwinding the DNA while degrading the ssDNA [39,41,47].
Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer experiments have demonstrated that Cas3 remains with cascade to cleave ssDNA using a reeling mechanism [36]. In vitro experiments using high-speed atomic force microscopy also demonstrated that Cas3 remains tightly associated with cascade, which repeatedly reels and releases the target DNA, then degrades the target [48]. In addition, Cas3 with cascade from E. coli exhibits collateral non-specific ssDNA cleavage activity [29,48]. The current interference mechanism from these reports suggests that stable cascade binding with locked R-loop construction provides cis cleavage of the NTS with helicase-dependent separation by reeling activity and trans cleavage of the TS by collateral activity. This results in progressive degradation of target dsDNA substrates.
Cas3 nuclease can bind to the conformationally changed Cascade complex by precise and complete recognition of the target sequence, which then activates its nuclease function. With multiple steps controlling the nuclease activity, the risk of Cas3 activation with incomplete recognition that results in unnecessary DNA cleavage can be significantly reduced. This high-fidelity interference process ensures the destruction of perfectly matching targets to destroy foreign invaders with safety (Fig. 2). A recent report showed that type I-A cascade and Cas3 can form an integrated complex, and that the Cas3 nuclease is allosterically activated by cascade upon

full R-loop formation [28]. Collateral cleavage activity has been observed in type I-A, as well as in type I-E, suggesting that a common DNA degradation mechanism occurs in type I CRISPR systems [29] .
Genome editing with the type I CRISPR system
Among the subtypes of class 1 type I CRISPR, I-A, I-C, I-D, and IE have reportedly been used for genome editing in mammalian cells (Table 1). Utilizing the target-binding ability of the cascade complex in the absence of Cas3, cascade-FokI fusion system-mediated generation of small inserted or deleted (indel) mutations [49] and cascade-mediated transcriptional regulation in humans [26] were reported as genetic manipulations in eukaryotes in 2019. In the same year, using the type I-E CRISPR-Cas3 system including a Cas3 nuclease was shown for the first time to result in mainly long-range chromosomal deletions upstream of the 5 PAM in target DNA [24,25]. Here, we summarize the unique characteristics of type I CRISPR-mediated genome editing in human cells.
Type I-E CRISPR
Our group demonstrated genomic deletions in human cells by plasmid-based expression of type I-E CRISPR-Cas3 from E. coli (Eco) and precursor crRNAs, which were intracellularly assembled into a functional complex [25]. The mutated start positions by Eco CRISPR-Cas3 were distributed broadly around 0-400 bp upstream of the PAM locus and the deletion patterns were distributed in a range of 0.5-80 kb from the PAM. Type I-E CRISPR could induce mutations that deleted an average of 5 kb upstream of the 5 PAM sequence, while mutations smaller than 100 bp, as frequently observed in Cas9-mediated deletions, were not induced. Amplicon-seq analysis of more than 10 genes revealed the average efficiency of mutagenesis was approximately 20%. Cas3mediated exon skipping in the DMD gene to repair Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) protein expression was also successful in induced pluripotent stem cells derived from DMD patients, indicating the potential of the type I-E CRISPR system for clinical applications.
Dolan et al. also reported genomic deletions in human embryonic stem (ES) cells by direct introduction of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), consisting of crRNA, Cas3, and cascade derived from Thermobifida fusca (Tfu) [24]. The mutated start positions by Tfu CRISPR-Cas3 were distributed mainly around 0-400 bp upstream of the PAM locus and the deletion patterns were distributed in a range of 0.5-100 kb from the PAM, which are very similar to those by Eco CRISPR-Cas3. These unidirectional and long-range deletions generated by type I-E CRISPR contrast with the smaller indels generated by Cas9 or Cas12-based genome editing.
Type I-D CRISPR
Recently, type I-D, I-C, and I-A systems in Type I CRISPR can also reportedly induce large deletions in eukaryotic cells [27,28,50]. Genetic deletions were made in human HEK293T cells by plasmid-based expression of type I-D CRISPR from Microcystis aeruginosa and precursor crRNAs [50,51]. The system induced long-range deletions ranging from 2.5 kb to 19 kb at the target site. Short indels of a few nucleotides, like those generated by Cas9, were also detected. In addition, the edges of large deletions by the type I-D system are mainly introduced equally on both sides of the target locus, indicating bidirectionality rather than unidirectionality as observed in I-E CRISPR [50,52].
The Cas3 nuclease protein in the type I-A and I-D systems has separate helicase and nuclease domains, called Cas3' and Cas3", respectively [8]. In particular, the Cas3'' domain sequence in I-D CRISPR is encoded as a part of a type III Cas10-like large effector complex, which is named Cas10d [53].The Cas3' protein of the type I-D system, called Cas3d, lacks the HD-nuclease domain responsible for DNA cleavage activity, while Cas10d with an HD-like nuclease domain shows DNA cleavage activity

Fig. 2. Overview of the molecular mechanism in type I-E CRISPR-mediated genome editing. Top panel: Effector factors required to function in genome editing. The cascade complex in type I-E consists of one Cas5, one Cas6, one Cas8, two Cas11, and six Cas7 protein molecules. Middle panel: Cas8 in the cascade complex first scans the PAM sequence. The crRNA hybridizes with the target DNA strand, leading to the formation of a three-stranded nucleic acid structure called the R-loop. After the conformation of cascade is changed, Cas3 binds to the cascade complex. Bottom panel: The recruited Cas3 induces a nick in the non-target DNA strand (NTS) at the R-loop through its nuclease domain (red). Then, the helicase domain (red) in Cas3 unwinds and reels the NTS in an ATP-dependent manner upstream of the PAM site. The collateral activity of Cas3 subsequently cleaves the target strand (TS), resulting in double strand breaks (DSB) upstream of the target site. Combined with repetitive cleavages of the NTS, this can degrade the target double strand DNA substrate as an interference mode (blue).

in eukaryotic cells. Cas10d also functions in PAM recognition, as well as Cas8 in other type I CRISPR systems. The amino acid sequence of Cas10d has higher homology to the type III Cas10 protein than to other type I Cas8 proteins [54]. The detailed mechanism controlling this remains unclear, and these differences in functional units in the DNA cleavage process may affect to the direction of mutations of I-A and I-D CRISPR systems [28].
This has also been successfully applied to the tomato genome, indicating that type I CRISPR can be used not only in humans, but also in other eukaryotic organisms such as plants [51]. As described below, the addition of Cas11, hidden within the Cas10 coding sequence in I-D, or the Cas8 coding sequence in I-B and I-C, recently enabled genome editing in human cells with each type [27]. For example, I-D from cyanobacteria can be used to knock out the transduced GFP gene in human cells with Cas11. Whether Cas11 is also enhanced for the reaction in Microcystis aeruginosa-derived I-D and if it can increase editing efficiency need further investigation.
Type I-C CRISPR
The minimal I-C CRISPR system (cascade-Cas3) derived from Neisseria lactamica (Nla) can induce large deletions of target regions in the human genome by using RNP, plasmid, and mRNA delivery methods [27]. RNP delivery of its processive Cas3 and cascade complex can achieve high editing efficiencies of up to 95% in HAP1 cells and 50% in human ES cells. Most of the large deletions induced by I-C CRISPR are unidirectional, pointing to the PAM-proximal direction.
Importantly, although I-C was previously described as a miniature type I CRISPR system that works with only four components, Cas3, Cas5, Cas7, and Cas8 in bacteria [55], the introduction of hidden Cas11 encoded within the Cas8 sequence enabled this system to function as a genome editing tool for eukaryotes [27]. Cas11 is also hidden in I-B and I-D CRISPR, and both systems derived from cyanobacteria Synechocystis could be used to knock out GFP in human cells in a Cas11-dependent manner [27]. The addition of Cas11 to the previously taxonomically hidden factors is expected to lead to new type I CRISPR systems that can be applied to genome editing in eukaryotic cells.
Type I-A CRISPR
Genome editing by type I-A CRISPR from Pyrococcus furiosus (Pfu) was recently achieved in human HAP1 and HEK293 cells by electroporation of RNPs that included the Cas11 protein [28]. The Pfu cascadeCas3 system is more efficient for genome editing when incubated at 42 °C, likely because of the origin from hyperthermophilic archaea. Deleted mutations of several hundred bp to 2 kb have been detected, but longer deletions by deep sequencing have not been investigated.

Type I-A CRISPR introduces bidirectional DNA deletions in human cells with high efficiency like type I-D [28,50]. The molecular mechanism controlling the different directions of deletions in each subtype is not well understood and will be studied more in the future. The PAM sequence of the type I-A system is 5 CCN, which has the advantage for design within GC-rich regions, unlike other type I systems [56,57]. This is expected to play an important role in the expansion of type I CRISPR for genome editing.
Off-target effects
To establish CRISPR as a novel genome editing tool for medical applications, it is important that the method is safe and does not affect similar sequences within the genome, which are called off-target candidate regions. For example, type I-E CRISPR has a longer spacer sequence of 32 nucleotides compared with the 20 nucleotides of Cas9 or the 24 nucleotides of Cas12, which may increase the specificity for target recognition [40,58,59] (Table 1). It should be noted that several nucleotides cannot be recognized within the spacer sequence because of the structure of the protein complex. Type I-E CRISPR cannot recognize every sixth position from the 5 end of the PAM sequence. Therefore, 27 bases in the crRNA are bound to the target strand and considered as a recognition length [40,47,58,59].
Off-target candidates of the Cas9 system in the human genome from two to three mismatches are generally detected by in silico analysis. Target sequences with as few mismatches as possible should be selected [60,61]. In type I CRISPR systems, which have longer target lengths than Cas9, off-target candidates with two or three mismatches are less frequently detected by in silico analysis. For example, in silico analysis to 27 bases within the target sequence of I-E CRISPR can generally detect sequences with five or more mismatches as off-target candidate regions in the human genome [25]. These candidates have been investigated with deep sequencing methods, such as whole genome sequencing and target capture sequencing, and no mutations have been detected. Analyses of genome editing efficiency with mismatches in the target sequences of the I-E and I-D systems demonstrated that DNA cleavage was detected with one or two mismatches, while there was almost no cleavage with three mismatches [25,50]. The proximal region to the PAM sequence, called the seed sequence, should be also considered for the recognition of the target sequence in both class 1 and class 2 CRISPR [25,50,58,59,62]. DNA cleavage is unlikely to occur when there are mismatches up to the 11th nucleotide from the PAM [1]. Off-target effects in human cells have not yet been comprehensively analyzed, and design tools have not yet been reported. We plan to release a design tool for selecting candidate target regions with few off-target sites in type I-E CRISPR, and the development of such a tool will increase the number of type I CRISPR users.

Applications with type I CRISPR systems
The characteristics of type 1 CRISPR indicate its potential application as a new genome editing technology for safe and reliable gene disruption. It has the potential to advance the therapeutic applications of gene therapy and industrial approaches, such as agriculture and fisheries. CRISPR-Cas9 with two gRNAs flanking the region has been shown to also induce large genomic deletions, but Cas9 with two sgRNAs may increase the possibility of undesired off-target mutations, as well as unintended reverse mutations between cleavage sites [25]. Therefore, type I CRISPR is expected to be particularly useful for gene disruption because it can efficiently induce genomic deletions with a single crRNA. However, compared with the many medical and industrial applications of class 2 CRISPR [63-65], type 1 CRISPR is still in the development stage because of numerous issues needing to be resolved, such as safety verification and in vivo delivery difficulties.
Several subtypes have collateral cleavage activity that can result in the cleavage of nearby non-specific sequences after their target. These include type V Cas12a [66] and type VI Cas13 [67,68]. The application of this collateral cleavage to nucleic acid detection is called CRISPRDx, and the COVID-19 global pandemic has led to an explosive increase in research on its application as point-of-care testing (POCT) for virus detection. This application has high potential for not only the rapid detection of viruses and pathogens, but also the identification of various inherited diseases and mutation patterns in cancer cells for diagnoses [ 69 , 70 ].
In CRISPR-Dx, the presence of a target sequence, such as viral nucleic acid, triggers the collateral activity of the CRISPR complex and cleaves a non-specific DNA/RNA probe in trans. The detection probe with fluorescent marker is quenched in the intact state and emits fluorescence when cleaved by the activated CRISPR complex [69,70]. The detection method using Cas12a was established as the DETECTR (DNA endonuclease targeted CRISPR trans reporter), and CRISPR-Cas13a targeting RNA was also established as the SHERLOCK (Specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing) method [66-68]. Because type I-E CRISPR also has collateral cleavage activity, the CRISPR-Cas3-based nucleic acid detection method was established as the CONAN (Cas3 Operated Nucleic Acid detectioN) method [29]. These excellent diagnostic methods are already available for COVID-19 detection, having both the advantages of sensitivity and accuracy of PCR testing and the speed, convenience, and low cost of antigen testing [30,71-74]. Recently, it was reported that type I-A has also collateral cleavage activity at 58 °C, indicating the possibility of its use for CRISPR-Dx [28]. The development of type I CRISPR for diagnostic tools will continue to be expanded in the future.
Conclusion
About 10 years have passed since CRISPR-Cas9 was first reported, and clinical trials in gene therapy for various diseases are already in progress [65,75,76]. The future for its medical applications is promising. Type I CRISPR can efficiently edit large genomic regions without requiring multiple crRNAs as CRISPR-Cas9 does. It is expected to be useful for gene therapy by exon skipping, complete removal of viral sequences or transposons, and efficient analysis of long non-coding regions. However, the following issues have been raised: lower genome editing efficiency compared with CRISPR-Cas9, difficulty in vivo delivery because of the large number of effector factors required, and controlling deletion sizes. By addressing these issues, type I CRISPR will become more useful as a genome editing tool in eukaryotes.
Type I CRISPR is also expected to be used for CRISPR-Dx, which has recently been utilized for COVID-19 diagnosis. In addition to type I CRISPR, type III CRISPR is also class 1 and is available for CRISPRDx [77-79]. Among the seven technologies to watch in 2022 by Nature, CRISPR-related technologies are three of them: "Precise genome manipulation," "Targeted genetic therapies," and "CRISPR-based diagnostics" [80]. Genome editing technology is used in various life science fields

and basic research worldwide, and type I and class 2 CRISPR systems are also becoming indispensable technologies.
