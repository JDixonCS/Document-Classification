21 Abstract 22 Background / Objectives The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 is a serious public 23 health issue. Large-scale surveillance screenings are crucial but can exceed 24 diagnostic test capacities. We set out to optimize test conditions and implemented 25 high throughput pool testing of respiratory swabs into SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. 26 Study design In preparation for pool testing, we determined the optimal pooling 27 strategy and pool size. In addition, we measured the impact of vortexing prior to 28 sample processing, compared pipette- and swab-pooling method as well as the 29 sensitivity of three different PCR assays. 30 Results Using optimized strategies for pooling, we systematically pooled 55,690 31 samples in a period of 44 weeks resulting in a reduction of 47,369 PCR reactions. In 32 a low prevalence setting, we defined a preferable pool size of ten in a two-stage 33 hierarchical pool testing strategy. Vortexing of the swabs increased cellular yield by a 34 factor of 2.34, and sampling at or shortly after symptom onset was associated with 35 higher viral loads. By comparing different pooling strategies, pipette-pooling was 36 more efficient compared to swab-pooling. 37 Conclusions For implementing pooling strategies into high throughput diagnostics, 38 we recommend to apply a pipette-pooling method, using pool sizes of ten samples, 39 performing sensitivity validation of the PCR assays used, and vortexing swabs prior 40 to analyses. Our data shows, that pool testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection is feasible 41 and highly effective in a low prevalence setting.

1. Introduction

43

44 The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a serious public health problem of unprecedented

45 magnitude in recent times. In particular individuals at older ages or with comorbidities

46 are at a high risk to develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring

47 hospitalization and intensive care [1]. Therefore, it is essential to control person-to-

48 person transmission in order to protect vulnerable individuals and limit the number of

49 severe cases. Until herd immunity is achieved by vaccination, nonpharmaceutical

50 interventions need to be applied. Many countries could successfully contain the

51 spread of COVID-19 through social distancing or lock-down measures, contact

52 tracing, quarantine, and large-scale testing in the ongoing pandemic [2,3]. In order to

53 control viral transmission when lifting lock-down strategies, large-scale testing and

54 surveillance are critical interventions. These approaches are based on frequent tests

55 of individuals e.g. by rapid antigen-based tests or reverse transcription-real-time PCR

56 (rRT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in swab specimens. However, large-scale

57 surveillance screenings can exceed the test capacities of diagnostic laboratories.

58

Pooling swab specimens for PCR testing can increase test capacities and limit

59 the consumption of reagents [4]. Pool testing is highly efficient in a setting of low

60 disease prevalence and the availability of highly sensitive test methods [5]. It can be

61 applied to enable surveillance screenings of asymptomatic individuals in public

62 institutions e.g. hospitals, schools or retirement homes, which carry a high risk for

63 superspreading events and severe disease courses. When pool testing is

64 established, test conditions need to be optimized including (a) the type of pooling

65 strategy and pool sizes, (b) sample preparation and pooling method, (c) the quality of

66 SARS-CoV-2 detection by PCR. In this study, our aim was to determine and

2. Materials and Methods

70

71 2.1 Pool testing algorithm

72 Pooling efficiency was computed using a web tool published by Bilder and colleagues

73 [5,6]. Calculations were performed assuming a test sensitivity of 99% or 95% and a

74 test specificity of 99%. The expected number of tests was computed for different pool

75 sizes as described [5].

76

77 2.2 Swab specimens

78 Oropharyngeal or combined nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were collected and

79 transferred into MSwabTM Medium, UTM-RT/mini (COPAN Diagnostics, Murrieta,

80 CA), BD ESwabTM (Becton & Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA), Sigma Transwab®

81 Purflock® (Medical Wire & Equipment, Corsham, Wiltshire, England), or PBS. All

82 specimens were processed at the Institute of Virology, University Hospital of Cologne

83 within 12 hours after collection. Samples were stored for validation procedures at -

84 80°C.

85

86 2.3 Samples, clinical data and Ethics

87 All samples and clinical data were collected on the wards or outpatient departments

88 of the University Hospital of Cologne. No identifying data were used for the patient's

89 characterization. According to §15 subparagraph 3 (Professional Code for Physicians

90 in Germany) ethical principles of WMA Declaration of Helsinki were respected.

91 The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (Ethics Committee) of the

92 Medical Faculty, University Hospital Cologne, Germany (ethical vote no. 20-1638).

95

After arrival in our laboratory, samples were vortexed 5 seconds, and

96 preselected to be tested individually or in pools. To determine the cellular content of

97 the same specimens before and after vortexing, human -globin-gene quantification

98 was performed as published [7].

99

For the pipette-pooling method and to simulate various pool sizes, positive

100 specimens with various Ct-values were combined with increasing volumes of

101 negative samples combined as a stock, accordingly. For the swab-pooling method,

102 nine SARS-CoV-2 negative and one positive swab were used. After removal of the

103 transport medium, 1.2 ml PBS was added to the tube containing the swab and

104 vortexed 5 seconds. The PBS was then transferred to the next swab tube and

105 vortexed. Following this principle, ten swabs were merged. Preparation time was

106 measured.

107

108 2.5 Reverse transcription, amplification and detection with three instruments

109 (Instrument I) Nucleic acid extraction of 500 µl sample volume was performed using

110 the MagNA Pure® 96 DNA and Viral NA Large Volume Kit eluted in 100 µl elution

111 buffer, followed by amplification on LightCycler® 480 II (Roche Diagnostics,

112 Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Detection of

113 SARS-CoV-2 was conducted using the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0

114 (altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) or LightMix® SarbecoV E-gene plus equine

115 arteritis virus (EAV) control (TibMolBiol, Berlin, Germany). (Instrument II) Processing

116 of swabs was implemented with Panther Fusion® Hologic® and SARS-CoV-2 was

117 detected using 5 l of total RNA in 20 l of LightMix® SarbecoV E-gene plus -globin

118 as internal control (TibMolBiol, Berlin, Germany). As second target the N-gene was

119 amplified (inhouse primer sets in multiplex PCR, data unpublished). (Instrument III)

120 Detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed on a Roche cobas® 6800 using the

121 cobas® SARS-CoV-2 kit targeting the E-gene/ORF-1a/b regions according to 122 manufacturer's protocol. SARS-CoV-2 was quantified using dilution series of cell 123 culture supernatant extrapolated to approved standards (INSTAND e.V., Düsseldorf, 124 Germany), measured on all instruments, and Ct-values adjusted to Instrument III 125 (Cta). 126 127 2.6 Data analysis 128 For correlation analysis, a spearman's rank correlation was used. For comparing 129 globin-gene concentrations, a Mann-Whitney test was performed. To assess 130 statistical differences in Ct-values comparing pooling methods or PCR assays, a 131 multiple comparison one-way ANOVA was used. For comparing preparation times 132 and for matched-pair analysis, a paired t-test was used. The amplification factor was 133 calculated as published [8], Kruskal-Wallis test was performed. GraphPadPrism 7.0 134 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for statistical analysis. Figures were created 135 using Adobe Illustrator 18.1 (Adobe Inc.).

3. Results

137

138 3.1 Hierarchical pool testing

139 Pool testing can be performed using different strategies. In this study we conducted

140 two-stage hierarchical pooling procedures (Figure 1A). Swab samples were

141 combined and tested in a single PCR reaction. If the pool test was positive, the

142 remaining sampling material of the included specimens was retested separately to

143 detect the infected individual. If the pool test was negative, all individuals were

144 declared as not infected [5,9,10].

145

Pool testing efficiency depends on the disease prevalence. Bilder and

146 colleagues [5,6] proposed an algorithm to compute the expected number of tests

147 when performing two-stage hierarchical pool testing (Figure 1B and C). As the

148 disease prevalence increases, the reduction of PCR tests declines due to the

149 retesting of individual samples of positive pools. However, the pooling efficiency of

150 smaller pool sizes declines more slowly compared to pooling 20 or more samples.

151

At the time pool testing was initiated, the positivity rate at the University

152 Hospital of Cologne was 3.88% (Figure 1D). However, by excluding samples of

153 symptomatic individuals and recently positive tested persons, the positivity rate of

154 pooled samples was below 0.1%.

B: The reduction of PCR tests compared 158 to individual testing (continuous lines are nonlinear regression curves, outer dotted 159 lines are 95% or 99% test sensitivity, respectively) and C: the expected number of 160 tests for different pool sizes are shown. Calculations were performed as published 161 [6,9]. D: The mean positivity rate per week of tests performed at the University 162 Hospital of Cologne and in Germany (as published [11]) are shown. 163 164 165 3.2 Pooling method and sensitivity of the PCR assays 166 Pool testing requires optimal sample conditions in order to minimize false negative 167 results. Pre-analytic factors can influence the test results. We could not detect a 168 significant difference in viral loads indicated by Ct-values comparing oropharyngeal 169 swabs with combined nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. However, samples taken in the 170 late phase of infection had significantly lower viral loads compared to earlier 171 timepoints (Supplementary Figure 2A and B). Therefore, pool testing needs to be 172 sensitive and safe in detecting even low virus concentrations. We investigated 173 whether vortexing increases the number of cells released from the swabs (Figure 174 2A). We measured the -globin-gene concentration in the medium of n=33 swabs 175 without vortexing and of the same specimens after 5 seconds of vortexing. The 176 average increase of -globin concentration after vortexing was 2.34-fold (95% CI 177 1.622-3.057; p=0.0001). In addition, we could detect SARS-CoV-2 in three 178 specimens in which vortexing reduced the Ct-value from 33.39 to 32.79, from 28.50 179 to 28.19 and from 35.58 to 32.87, respectively. 180

181 We compared two pooling strategies. For the pipette pooling, transport medium from

182 each of ten storage tubes were combined into one test tube. For the swab pooling,

183 transport medium was removed, PBS added to a first tube containing the swab,

184 vortexed, and transferred into a second swab tube followed by vortexing. After the

185 PBS had traveled through all ten swab tubes, it was transferred into a test tube

186 (Figure 2A). To test feasibility of both methods, four operators processed n=6 pools

187 applying both methods, respectively. The mean processing time was 3 minutes, 47

188 seconds for a swab-based pool (95% CI: (2 min,59sec.)-(4min,36sec.)) and 1

189 minute, 55 seconds for a pipette-based pool (95% CI: (1min,33sec.)-(2min,16sec.)).

190

In order to investigate the sensitivity, we generated 16 different pools with

191 each of the two pooling methods, by merging one SARS-CoV-2-positive sample with

192 nine negative samples, respectively (Figure 2A bottom right). The mean Ct of

193 individually tested samples was 28.41 (95% CI 26.17-30.66), 30.77 for the swab

194 pooling method (95% CI 28.79-32.75), and 31.18 for the pipette pooling method

195 (95% CI 28.92-33.44). There was no significant difference between Ct-values of the

196 two pooling methods. With both methods there was a single pool, which yielded a

197 negative test result (triangle shape in Figure 2A).

198

To compare the detection rates of three PCR systems used in our diagnostic

199 laboratory, ten-fold dilution series of n=20 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples were

200 simultaneously tested on three instruments (I, II, and III, referring to the Roche

201 LightCycler® 480 II, the Hologic Panther Fusion®, and Roche Cobas® 6800

202 System). Ct-values for e-gene amplification, included in all assays, were analyzed as

203 they yielded similar Ct-values compared to the second viral target, respectively

204 (Supplementary Figure 1C). As shown in Figure 2B and E, instrument I and III could

205 detect all undiluted samples whereas instrument II only detected 18 out of 20

206 samples. The mean Ct-values of the undiluted samples were 27.48 (95% CI 25.4-

207 29.57) for instrument I, 31.55 (95% CI 28.77-34.33) for instrument II and 28.44 (95%

208 CI 26.13-30.75) for instrument III (Figure 2D). When diluting the samples 10-fold,

209 instruments I and III could still detect all samples, whereas the detection rate of

210 instrument II was 70%. Instrument III could still detect 95% of samples at a 1:100

211 dilution and showed a slower decline of the detection rate compared to instruments I

212 and II. The amplification factors for the three instruments were 1.957 (CI 1.867-

213 2.149), 1.906 (CI 1.879-2.153) and 2.240 (CI 2.074-2.407), respectively (Figure 2C).

214 The lowest detectable copy number was 200 copies for instrument I, 2,000 for

215 instrument II, and 20 copies for instrument III as determined using two INSTAND

216 standards (Figure 2F).

217

To determine the detection-rate for different pool sizes, 25 positive samples

218 with Ct-values ranging from 18.96 to 34.99 were each diluted in a stock of negative

219 specimens and tested in duplicates on instrument III. All pools were SARS-CoV-2-

220 positive, however, for two pools the 1:20 and 1:50 dilution resulted in one negative

221 and one positive replicate, respectively (Figure 2G).

We set up a pool 247 testing facility, implemented features for pool testing into the laboratory software, and 248 systematically pooled up to 488 samples per day (Figure 3A). In order to limit the 249 number of positive samples run in pools, we preselected samples supported by 250 algorithms of the laboratory software. Patients that had been tested positive for 251 SARS-CoV-2 before or showed COVID-19-like symptoms were tested individually.

252 Pool testing was performed for surveillance screenings of patients and staff of as well

253 as for every patient admitted to the University Hospital of Cologne.

254

The mean percentage of reduced PCR tests was 85.77%. Decreased savings

255 of PCR reactions were due to retesting caused by technical issues or positive tested

256 pools. Within 44 weeks, 55,690 samples were tested in pools and only 4.7%

257 (n=2,640 samples) had to be retested individually (Figure 3B). As Figure 3C shows,

258 5,681 pools were analyzed from which 195 were positive. Another 86 pools were

259 retested due to technical issues. In total, 47,369 PCR reactions were saved by pool

260 testing. The Ct-values of 128 positive pools and the respective individual positive

261 sample strongly correlated (rs = 0.97, CI 0.96-0.98, p<0.0001) with a mean Ct-value

262 of 30.39 for pools and 27.38 for individual samples (Figures 3 D and E). Ct-values of

263 individual positive samples were adjusted to Instrument III. 82.86% of the samples

264 displayed Ct-values 35 and 17.14% >35 (Figures 3 F and G).

4. Discussion

278

279 Large-scale testing and surveillance screenings enable the rapid detection of clusters

280 of infections and help preventing superspreading events and uncontrolled

281 transmission of the virus until herd immunity by vaccination is reached. However, test

282 capacities are limited and PCR tests are cost-intensive. Pool testing is a feasible

283 option to enable high-throughput screenings without overwhelming capacities of

284 diagnostic laboratories. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation

285 addressing various aspects of pool testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However,

286 reports on this topic have recently been published [17-31].

287

Eberhardt and colleagues suggest forming subgroups if a pool yields a

288 positive result [20]. SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals need to be rapidly detected in

289 order to apply quarantine measures and perform contact tracing. Therefore, pooling

290 strategies need to be time efficient as well as suitable for high-throughput screenings.

291 Following these considerations, we decided to use two-stage hierarchical pool testing

292 with a pool size of ten samples. Increasing pool sizes, and forming subgroups after a

293 positive result, could further improve test efficiency [20] but would delay the test

294 result for the individual specimen. In a low prevalence setting with restricted test

295 resources and a neglectable time aspect, for instance in developing countries,

296 increasing pool sizes and forming subgroups is a reasonable option. Another

297 approach is the combinatorial pool testing strategy [24,25,32]. Here, samples are

298 assigned into multiple pools which enables the detection of infected individuals in a

299 single round of testing. In our study, we used the hierarchical testing strategy due to

300 logistics of a high-throughput diagnostic setting.

301

Pre-analytical handling can substantially impact test sensitivity, however,

302 limited data on this topic are available. Test results are influenced by improper

303 transport conditions, variations of the sampling device (flocked vs. cotton swabs), the

304 transport media [33,34] as well as the anatomical structure of the pharynx

305 (Mallampati score). We could not observe differences in Ct-values comparing

306 oropharyngeal and combined nasal/oropharyngeal specimens. This is in line with

307 findings of Woelfl et al., describing no differences in viral loads or detection rates

308 when comparing nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens [35]. In addition,

309 high viral concentrations and detection rates in salvia compared to nasopharyngeal

310 swabs were reported [29,36] and saliva samples can be used for pool testing [37].

311

In our study, different operators performed specimen collection, which could

312 be a limitation of the data, as analyzed by Basso and colleagues. Two different

313 operators collected 70 swabs each and a high variability of test results was observed

314 [38]. This effect should not be underestimated.

315

316 We developed a feasible pooling procedure that can readily be implemented in

317 diagnostic routines. The preparation for pool testing contained besides extensive

318 technical investigations, also changes in the laboratory logistics and adaptions of the

319 laboratory software. The data communicated here will contribute to the process of

320 finding and implementing a consensus pool testing strategy enabling larger test

321 capacities to effectively combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
