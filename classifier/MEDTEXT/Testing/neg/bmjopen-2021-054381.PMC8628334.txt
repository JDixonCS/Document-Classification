ABSTRACT Introduction Branch atheromatous disease (BAD) contributes to small-v­ essel occlusion in cases of occlusion or stenosis of large calibre penetrating arteries, and it is associated with a higher possibility of early neurological deterioration (END) and recurrent stroke in acute ischaemic stroke. As the pathology of BAD is due to atherosclerosis, we postulate that early intensive medical treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and high-­ intensity statins may prevent END and recurrent stroke in acute small subcortical infarction caused by BAD. Methods and analysis In this prospective, single-­ centre, open-­label, non-r­andomised, single-­arm study using a historical control, we will compare early DAPT and high-i­ntensity statin treatment with a historical control group of patients with BAD who were treated with single antiplatelet therapy without high-­intensity statin treatment. Patients will be eligible for enrolment if they are admitted for acute ischaemic stroke within 24hours, have a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 1-8 and are diagnosed with BAD by MRI. Patients will take aspirin, clopidogrel and high-­intensity statins (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) within 24hours of stroke onset, followed by aspirin or clopidogrel alone from day 22. The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients who develop END within 7days of stroke onset (defined as an increase in the NIHSS score 2 points) and recurrent stroke within 30 days. The total sample sizes will be 138 for the intervention group and 277 for the control group. A historical control group will be drawn from previous prospective observation studies. Ethics and dissemination The protocol of this study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (202001386A3). All participants will have to sign and date an informed consent form. The findings arising from this study will be disseminated in peer-r­eviewed journals and academic conferences. Trial registration number NCT04824911.

Strengths and limitations of this study
 This will be the first trial to evaluate the effectiveness of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and high-­intensity statins for the prevention of early neurological deterioration and recurrent stroke in patients with acute ischaemic stroke from branch atheromatous disease.
 This trial will recruit patients with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores of 1-8, which are more severe than current guideline suggestion of scores 3 for mild stroke with DAPT.
 A randomised controlled study with a parallel control arm receiving single antiplatelet treatment for mild stroke is against the latest guidelines, so it is inevitable to conduct this trial with a historical control group.
 The use of a historical control group has the inherent drawbacks of non-­randomisation and non-­blinding, so we cannot exclude the possibility of selection, performance, detection and attrition bias.
 Because DAPT and high-­intensity statin treatment are administered simultaneously, it is unable to know each treatment effect.
INTRODUCTION Small-­vessel occlusion is the most common stroke subtype in Asians; it is caused by the occlusion of deep perforating arteries, mainly by the underlying pathologies of lipohyalinosis or cerebral amyloid angiopathy.1 2 Branch atheromatous disease (BAD) has also been reported to contribute to small-v­essel occlusion in cases of occlusion or stenosis that occur at the origin of large calibre penetrating arteries, due to microatheromas or junctional atherosclerotic plaques.3 BAD is associated with an increased possibility of early neurological deterioration (END) and

recurrent stroke, especially progressive motor deficits, compared with infarction due to hypertensive arteriopathy.4-6 It has been proposed that BAD should be classified as large artery atherosclerosis rather than small vessel occlusion.7
Following acute ischaemic stroke, single antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin or clopidogrel, are the mainstay treatment for recurrent stroke prevention. However, the modest effects of single antiplatelet therapy led to the study of combination antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of recurrent stroke. The Clopidogrel in High-R­isk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events and the Platelet-O­ riented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke trials showed that dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) might be beneficial for reducing the probability of ischaemic events in patients with high-r­isk transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke.8 9 However, these studies included all non-e­ mbolic ischaemic stroke types. Some studies also showed that DAPT reduced the possibility of END.10 11 A retrospective observation study showed that DAPT was beneficial for the primary outcomes of stroke recurrence, myocardial infarction and all-­cause death in patients with large atherosclerotic stroke.12
For patients with acute ischaemic stroke, the guidelines suggest starting or continuing statin treatment as soon as oral medications can be used safely.13 Current guidelines also recommend high-­intensity or moderate-­intensity statin therapy, independent of the baseline low-d­ ensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-­C), to reduce the risk of stroke and cardiovascular events for patients with TIA or ischaemic stroke of atherosclerotic origin.14 High-­dose statin treatment in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke and TIA significantly reduced National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and improved short-­ term functional outcomes without increasing related adverse events15; it also effectively stabilised symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic plaques as documented by high-­resolution MRI.16
DAPT and high-­intensity statins are the mainstay treatments for intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS).17 As BAD and ICAS share the same pathology as atherosclerosis, we postulate that early intensive medical treatment with DAPT and high-i­ntensity statins may prevent END and recurrent stroke. This study aims to evaluate whether intensive medical therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel and high-i­ntensity statins can prevent END and recurrent stroke in acute small subcortical infarction caused by BAD.
METHODS Study design In this prospective, single-c­entre, open-­label, non-­ randomised, single-a­ rm, historically controlled study, we will compare early intensive treatment for BAD initiated within 24hours of stroke onset, using DAPT (aspirin plus clopidogrel) and high-­intensity statin treatment, with a

historical control group of patients with BAD treated with single antiplatelet therapy, without high-i­ntensity statin treatment.18 19 The study will be conducted in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Chiayi, Taiwan, from March 2021 to February 2023.
Study population Patients are eligible to participate if they meet the following inclusion criteria: (1) have a clinical diagnosis of ischaemic stroke with an NIHSS score of 1-8, (2) have an ischaemic lesion on diffuse-w­ eighted imaging (DWI) located in the striatocapsular territory or brain stem areas, with an axial diameter of 20mm, (3) have BAD, defined by a visible ischaemic lesion in three or more axial cuts on DWI in the lenticulostriate territory or infarcts that extend from the basal surface of the pons and (4) could receive intensive medical treatment within 24hours of stroke onset. Patients with >50% stenosis of the relevant arteries on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), including intracranial or extracranial internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery or basilar artery, will be excluded. We will also exclude patients at high risk of cardioembolic stroke, such as those with atrial fibrillation or heart failure. Full details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Box 1.
A historical control group will be drawn from our prospective observation studies, which have been executed between January 2011 and December 2020, and aimed to evaluate and predict END or atrial fibrillation.18 19 Patients will be selected if they fulfil the following inclusion criteria: took aspirin or clopidogrel alone and did not receive high-i­ntensity statin treatment. Patients in the historical control group will have received statin treatment once their total cholesterol was 160mg/dL or their LDL-­C was 100mg/dL. High-i­ntensity statin treatment includes atorvastatin 40-80mg or rosuvastatin 20-40mg daily.20 All clinical information and outcomes have been prospectively recorded.
Trial intervention Dual antiplatelet and high-i­ntensity statin treatment will be administered within 24hours of stroke onset (figure 1). Dual antiplatelet treatment includes aspirin (300mg loading and 100mg/day) and clopidogrel (300mg loading and 75mg/day) and high-i­ntensity statins includes atorvastatin 40-80mg/day or rosuvastatin 20mg/day. Patients will take aspirin and clopidogrel for 21 days and then just take aspirin or clopidogrel alone. High-­intensity statins will be maintained for 90 days, but a decreased dose is allowed if any side effects occur, including elevated liver functions, elevated creatine kinase and myalgia or at the judgement of the treating physician. We will follow-­up with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase 14 days after treatment and will follow-­up with ALT, creatine kinase and LDL-­C 90 days after treatment. Patients with atherosclerotic plaques in the first MRI will keep high-i­ntensity statin treatment for 6 months.

 Ongoing treatment in another study of an investigational therapy, or treatment in such a study within the last 7days.
Neurological deficits will be evaluated by a stroke study nurse using the NIHSS, on day 1, day 2, day 3, day 7 and day 90. As END in lacunar infarction is mainly associated with motor deficits, END is defined as an NIHSS score increase 2 within 7days of stroke onset.21 Clinical outcomes at admission and at 90 days will be evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). A good outcome is defined as an mRS score 1. Mortality at 3 months and any haemorrhagic complications will also be recorded. All examinations will be performed after obtaining written informed consent from the patients or the appropriate family members.
Patients with visible atheromatous plaques in the parental artery in the initial MRI will receive a follow-­up MRI 6 months later to see the interval changes in atheromatous plaques.
Study outcomes The primary outcome will be the percentage of patients with END within 7days and recurrent ischaemic stroke within 30 days. Secondary outcomes will include: (1) the percentage of patients with favourable functional recovery, defined as an mRS 1 on day 90, (2) the percentage of patients with new clinical vascular events within 90 days, including ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, TIA, myocardial infarction and vascular death, (3) changes in atherosclerotic

In the intervention group, patients will take aspirin (300mg loading and 100mg/day), clopidogrel (300mg loading and 75mg/day) and high-i­ntensity statins (atorvastatin 40-80mg/day or rosuvastatin 20mg/day) within 24hours of stroke onset, followed by aspirin or clopidogrel alone from day 22. High-­intensity statins includes atorvastatin 40-80mg/day or rosuvastatin 20mg/day. In the historical control group, patients will be selected from previous prospective studies if they fulfil the following inclusion criteria: took aspirin or clopidogrel alone and did not receive high-­intensity statin treatment.

plaques, which will be measured by high-­resolution MRI at the start of the study and after 6 months, (4) the number of moderate to severe bleeding events as defined by the Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Arteries (GUSTO) classification22 and (5) the total mortality rate.
Sample size In single subcortical infarction, END was reported to occur frequently in BAD with an incidence of 27% in our previous cohort and 33.8%-40% in other studies.10 23 The END rate may decrease to 9.7% in patients with BAD who underwent combination antiplatelet therapy with cilostazol.10 The total sample sizes will be 138 for the intervention group and 277 for the control group. The estimated END rate is 27% for the control group and 15% for the intervention group, with 80% power and a two-­sided  of 0.05. The intent-­to-­ treat principle will be applied to the primary outcome analysis, and the sample size is, therefore, inflated to safeguard against 5% lost to follow-­up in the actual treatment groups, which could dilute the effect size.
Statistical analysis Statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS statistical software (V.25). The Kolmogorov-S­ mirnov test will be used to examine the normality of continuous variables. The Mann-­Whitney U test and Student's t-­test will be used to test for differences between the two groups, as appropriate. Categorical data will be analysed using the 2 test. A propensity score matching analysis will be used to measure and balance predetermined covariates between two groups. A logistic regression model will be used to test independent variables for the measured outcomes. Variables showing a p value of <0.1 for univariate analysis will be entered into the multivariate logistic analysis using the forward selection method. All tests will be two-­tailed, and a p value of <0.05 is considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Data management All the completed documents and the informed consent forms will be stored in a secured facility, under lock and key. The database for clinical data will be created using Access software and the access will be limited to principal investigators. A study steering committee will be established to ensure that the study was conducted to the required standards. The clinical research assistant will verify all consent forms, compliance with study protocol and procedures, and data quality. The research team will make half-­yearly reports to the study steering committee. All the records and documents will be kept for 7 years after the completion of the study.
Adverse events Any adverse events that occur during the conduct of the study will be reported to the Domain Specific Research Board, according to the local institutional policy. Interim analyses will be conducted by the study steering committee to monitor the accumulating data and to decide continuing or stopping the trial.

Patient and public involvement Patients and members from stroke associations participated in the preparation and formulation of this proposal. Patients with acute ischaemic stroke from BAD will be involved in the trial. The associations will be involved in plans to disseminate the study results to their members and wider patient communities.
