DESTRUCTION versus DECOMPOSITION.
It is a marvellous fact that organic material, dead or effete, in undergoing those changes which befit it for usefulness in a lower sphere
of creation, becomes offensive and dangerous to animated organisms ? more especially to those of whose systems it formed a part. The descent from the organic to the inorganic is a slow
process, and the intermediate steps of the descent when the complex is being broken up into the simple, are characterised by the evolution of noxious and deleterious products. It is these transitionary products of decomposition which constitute the greatest dangers to health and life to .which human, and in lesser degree other, beings are subjected, and one of the main objects of sanitation is to prevent or hasten the process
of decomposition of organic material. Prevention may be accomplished in various ways?by
embalming or hermetically sealing, disinfecting (pickling) 011 the one hand, or by making
arrangements for the utilization of the material
while in an early stage of chemical retrogression. The hastening of decomposition can also be accomplishe d by exposing the material to those physical influences ? heat and moisture the
chief of them?which are known to accelerate
the stages of the process. There is, however, one means of overcoming the dangers inseparable from decomposition, which is vastly superior to any means of staying or hastening the process, namely, subjecting the ma-
terial to the influence of an agency, which
is capable by one short step of reducing it to harmless inorganic substances. Electricity chemical agents and heat are the means competent to accomplish this end, and of these powers, heat is the cheapest, most effective and manageable.
These principles are applicable to all dead or effete organic material, but it is with reference to the disposal of the human dead, that they acquire the chiefest interest. The retardation of decomposition has been extensively adopted in the form of embalming, and this process has also gained sentimental support from gratifying the feeling which prompts men to preserve the forms of those whom they have respected

and loved ; but it is an expensive and diffi-
cult, and not very perfect proceeding, and has been abandoned by mankind never, it
is probable, to be revived. The coffining of the dead and their consignment to graves and vaults retards decomposition, but that is a very doubtful advantage. Decomposition inevitably takes place even in hermetically sealed metallic coffins, and the process, though removed from sight and smell, may nevertheless endanger health, and is probably more competent so to do than rapid decomposition.
The pickling of the dead was a part of the process of embalming, and with it has gone out of use, except for temporary purposes, and the
utilization of the dead material for immediate

conversion into animal tissue is exemplified by the mode of disposal of the dead peculiar to the

Parsis, which is not likely to become general.

The acceleration of decomposition has not, as

far as we are aware, been deliberately chosen

as a means of disposal, unless burial of the

naked body in shallow graves dug in alluvial soil in the tropics, as is done Mahomedans and low caste Hindus,

a moist
by the
can be

brought under that definition. The casting of
corpses into rivers in this country fulfils the

same purpose ; but both these methods are re-

pulsive and unhealthy.

From a purely scientific point of view, des-
truction by fire, or cremation, which entirely
abolishes all the offensive and perilous stages of decomposition,isinfinitely preferable to any other mode of disposing of the dead. A few years ago the subject of cremation was eagerly discussed in England, and as a practical result a
crematorium was erected in the Woking cemetery, in which, we observe, the body of a young Indian Rajah was recently burnt. The idea has not taken in England. There are objections, religious, sentimental and social, to its adoption,
which it will take years, if not centuries, to remove. Iu this country cremation of the dead
is the custom of a large majority of the popula-
tion, and the idea is therefore more familiar.
There are evidences, however, that the practice is not so universal as it ought to be, and there are strong reasons for concluding that its exten-

sioii would make very materially for sanitationIn Bombay, for example, the municipality is greatly exercised by the circumstance that the
burial of low caste Hindus in " the flats " is a
serious impediment to sanitary reform, and cremation lias recently been suggested as a salutary substitute. Again, it appears from the reports of
the Calcutta River Police that 70 human bodies
and 4,853 carcases of animals were found float-
ing in the Ilooghly last year. How many more floated past the town by night and were not seen by the police, it is impossible to say. But
this circumstance constitutes no mean menace
to the public health and calls for more general and thorough cremation. Nor is the question of crematiou limited to disposal of the dead. The refuse of Calcutta which undergoes slow and loathsome decomposition in the swamps on
the east of the town and fills the air with
sickening stinks whenever the wind blows from that quarter, ought to be burnt in furnaces rather than allowed to fester and so pollute the air of the city and poison its inhabitants. The principle of destruction is from every point of view preferable to decomposition when dead and effete organic material is concerned, and we should be glad to see the operation of fire more largely resorted to as a sanitary agent in India than at
present, in all cases in which the issue with
which we have entitled this article is at stake.
