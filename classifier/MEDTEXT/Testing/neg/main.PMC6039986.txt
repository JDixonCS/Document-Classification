SUMMARY
EspH, a protein secreted by the diarrheagenic pathogen enteropathogenic Escherichia coli into intestinal epithelial cells, sequesters Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors and inhibits Rho guanosine triphosphatases. These EspH effects cause desmosomal perturbations and loss of epithelial barrier integrity, and contribute to bacterial persistence in the intestine.
BACKGROUND & AIMS: The diarrheagenic pathogen, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), uses a type III secretion system to deliver effector molecules into intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). While exploring the basis for the lateral membrane separation of EPEC-infected IECs, we observed infection-induced loss of the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein-2 (DSG2). We sought to identify the molecule(s) involved in, and delineate the mechanisms and consequences of, EPEC-induced DSG2 loss.
METHODS: DSG2 abundance and localization was monitored via immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, respectively. Junctional perturbations were visualized by electron microscopy, and cell-cell adhesion was assessed using dispase assays. EspH alanine-scan mutants as well as pharmacologic agents were used to evaluate impacts on desmosomal

alterations. EPEC-mediated DSG2 loss, and its impact on bacterial colonization in vivo, was assessed using a murine model.
RESULTS: The secreted virulence protein EspH mediates EPECinduced DSG2 degradation, and contributes to desmosomal perturbation, loss of cell junction integrity, and barrier disruption in infected IECs. EspH sequesters Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors and inhibits Rho guanosine triphosphatase signaling; EspH mutants impaired for Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor interaction failed to inhibit RhoA or deplete DSG2. Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1, which locks Rho guanosine triphosphatase in the active state, jasplakinolide, a molecule that promotes actin polymerization, and the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A, respectively, rescued infected cells from EPECinduced DSG2 loss. Wild-type EPEC, but not an espH-deficient strain, colonizes mouse intestines robustly, widens paracellular junctions, and induces DSG2 re-localization in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Our studies define the mechanism and consequences of EPEC-induced desmosomal alterations in IECs. These perturbations contribute to the colonization and virulence of EPEC, and likely related pathogens. (Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol 2018;6:163-180; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmgh.2018.04.007)

T he intestinal epithelial monolayer facilitates absorption of nutrients and fluids, and, simultaneously, serves as a barrier against the entry of harmful intraluminal components such as bacteria and toxins into the underlying tissue.1 The paracellular space between adjacent intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is bridged by protein complexes including tight junctions (TJs), adherens junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomal junctions.2 The apical-most TJs act as fences that maintain polarity by separating apical and basolateral membrane components of the epithelium, and form the major paracellular barrier.3 Adherens junctions, located immediately below TJs, comprise transmembrane cadherins and cytoplasmically attached a- and b-catenins that connect to cytoskeletal actin filaments.4 Desmosomal junctions, comprising membraneanchored desmoglein (DSG) and desmocollin (DSC), form spot-welds that confer stability and strength to cell junctions. Four DSG (DSG1-4) and 3 DSC (DSC1-3) isoforms are expressed in human beings in a tissue-specific manner.5 Only DSG2 and DSC2 are expressed in normal human intestinal epithelium.6 The N-termini of DSG and DSC are located in the intercellular space, and form homotypic and heterotypic interactions with desmosomal cadherins of adjacent cells.7 The plaque proteins plakoglobin, plakophilin, and desmoplakin connect the C-termini of DSG and DSC to intermediate filaments (IFs).8 Many disease states are marked by relocalization of junctional proteins, increased paracellular permeability, loss of cell-cell adhesion, and, in extreme cases, the gross exfoliation of cells.9 Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a leading cause of juvenile diarrheal disease mortality.10 EPEC belongs to the attaching and effacing (A/E) family of pathogens that intimately attach to epithelial cells and efface brush-border microvilli.11 EPEC elaborates a type III secretion system (T3SS) that translocates effector proteins into host cells and thereby modulates host cell signaling. Notably, effector protein-dependent barrier perturbation is thought to contribute to EPEC-induced diarrhea.12 The EPEC effectors EspF, EspG1/G2, Map, and NleA disrupt TJs and compromise epithelial barrier function.13-17 EPEC outer-membrane proteins disrupt adherens junctions by inducing the dissociation of cadherin/b-catenin complexes.18 Early electron microscopy studies on small intestinal biopsy samples from EPEC-infected children showed a separation of the lateral intercellular junctions of epithelial cells.19 We observed similar widening of paracellular junctions in EPEC-infected IECs, specifically in regions below the TJs. To test the hypothesis that the loss of desmosomes contributed to these changes, we evaluated desmosomal protein abundance in infected IECs. EPEC infection induced a marked decrease in DSG2, the only IEC desmoglein isoform. The aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the mechanisms and impact of EPEC-induced DSG2 downregulation in vitro and in vivo. Our studies show a novel role for the effector protein EspH, and for Rho guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) signaling, in modulating epithelial

monolayer integrity, barrier function, and bacterial colonization.
Materials and Methods
Cell Lines
The human IEC line C2BBe, a brush-border-expressing Caco-2 subclone,20 was used and cultured as reported previously.21
Bacterial Strains and Generation of Mutants
The EPEC O127:H6 strain E2348/69 and its isogenic derivatives, and the commensal E coli strain HS4, were used (Table 1). E2348/69 espH was disrupted via homologous recombination.22 A 202-bp espH internal fragment (base pairs 181-382) was cloned into the suicide vector pJP5603,23 and the resulting construct, pSE864, was introduced into E2348/ 69 via conjugation. Transconjugants were confirmed for espH disruption by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot, and 1 representative espH mutant, SE874, was used. For complementation studies, full-length espH was amplified and cloned into pTrcHis2-TOPO TA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) to generate pJLR1, and transformed into SE874 to generate SE874/C. espH also was cloned in-frame with the 6XHis tag sequence of pTrcHis2-TOPO TA (pJLR2). Alanine scans have been empirically found to be a particularly effective method for assessing the functional importance of residues within a protein.24 To identify EspH residues involved in RhoA inhibition, a panel of 29 espH alanine-scan mutants were engineered by sequentially replacing 5-amino acid stretches of EspH (excluding the N-terminal 25 amino acids containing the secretion signal) with alanine residues. To facilitate cloning of these mutants, an XhoI restriction site was introduced into pJLR2 via a 703G/A silent substitution to generate pJLR4. Dispase assay screens (described later) identified EspH mutants M14 and M16, corresponding to alterations of amino acids 88-92 and 98-102, respectively, as candidates for further study. To verify that M14 and M16 retained wild-type levels of EspH secretion, culture supernatants of wild-type (WT) EPEC and mutant strains grown in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) were immunoblotted as described later.

Growth of Bacteria and Infection of IECs
C2BBe culture medium was changed to serum-free DMEM 16 hours before infection. For infections, overnight bacterial cultures (in Luria-Bertani broth with appropriate antibiotics for plasmid selection) were subcultured at 1:20 dilution in serum-free DMEM and grown to midlogarithmic phase (OD600nm, 0.4) at 37C. Bacteria were added to the apical surface of IECs corresponding to an initial multiplicity of infection of 100, and infections were allowed to proceed for 3 hours unless otherwise indicated. For studies involving Rho activation or actin polymerization, IECs were pretreated with 300 ng/mL cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1-based Rho activator CN03 (Cytoskeleton, Inc, Denver, CO) or 1 mmol/L jasplakinolide (Thermo Fisher Scientific), for 1 hour before infection. For inhibitor studies, IECs were pretreated with 50 mmol/L pan-caspase inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk, 52 nmol/L calpain inhibitor I, 10 mmol/L proteasomal inhibitor MG132, or 250 nmol/L lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 2 hours before infection, and inhibitor levels were maintained through the course of infection.
Protein Extraction
Mock-treated and infected monolayers were washed with ice-cold, sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with calcium and magnesium (PBS-CM), scraped, harvested via centrifugation, resuspended in urea buffer (7 mol/L urea, 2 mol/L thiourea, 100 mmol/L 1,4-dithiothreitol, and 4% 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate hydrate), and lysed via sonication or by silica bead-beating (Bead Ruptor; Omni International, NW Kennesaw, GA).

Immunoblot Analyses
Protein extracts (50-100 mg) were separated by 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to 0.2-mm nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 and incubated with anti-DSG2, anti-DSC2, or anti-actin antisera (Abcam, Cambridge, MA; Sigma-Aldrich) following product recommendations. Horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antisera (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as secondary antisera. Membranes were developed with SuperSignal West Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Co-immunoprecipitation Studies
C2BBe cells were grown to 60% confluency and transfected with pEnter expression plasmid harboring C-terminal Flag-tagged p115-Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) (Vigene, Rockville, MD). Transfection was facilitated using jetPRIME transfection reagent (Polyplus Transfection, Illkirch, France) following the manufacturer's protocol. Two days after transfection, C2BBe cells were infected with EPEC strains at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for 3 hours. Samples were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped, and harvested via centrifugation. Proteins were extracted in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/L TrisCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 Â Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Immunoprecipitation was

performed on 5-mg protein extracts using Surebeads Protein A Magnetic beads (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) bound with anti-Flag M2 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). The presence of Flag-tagged p115-RhoGEF and His-tagged EspH in the immunoprecipitated samples was determined via Western blot analysis using p115-RhoGEF antibody (Abcam) and anti-6xHis-tag antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). To assess EspH secretion, 30-mL cultures of EPEC strains inoculated in serum-free DMEM and normalized to midlogarithmic phase (OD600nm, 0.4) were grown for 3 hours at 37C. Cultures were centrifuged at 400g for 10 minutes. Bacterial supernatants were filtersterilized and concentrated using Amicon 3-kilodalton cut-off filters (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA). EspH secretion was assessed via immunoblot analysis using anti6xHis-tag antibody.

Attachment Assays
To assess EPEC attachment to the intestinal mucosa, WTor SE874-infected C57BL/6J mice were euthanized on days 3 and 4 after infection (4 animals per condition). Segments of the cecum and proximal colon were isolated, cleaned, weighed, homogenized, serially diluted in PBS, and bacteria were enumerated on MacConkey agar containing 100 mg/mL nalidixic acid.
Fecal Shedding of EPEC
Mouse stool samples were collected daily for 4 days after infection, and weighed, homogenized in PBS, serially diluted, and bacteria were enumerated on MacConkey agar containing 100 mg/mL nalidixic acid. No colonies were recovered from the stool of uninfected animals, consistent with media selectivity for EPEC.

Dispase Assay
Cell adhesion strength was assessed using a modified dispase assay.25 Briefly, mock-treated and infected IEC monolayers were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution with CM, and incubated with dispase (20 mg/mL in Hank's balanced salt solution with CM) at 37C and 5% CO2 for 30 minutes. Detached monolayers were agitated mechanically for 5 minutes, and monolayer disruption was scored qualitatively (none, partial, or full).
RhoA Activity Assays
The low RhoA activity signal under standard infection conditions impeded detection of further EPEC/EspHmediated inhibition. To overcome this, baseline RhoA activity was boosted by pretreating serum-starved, confluent IECs with 5 mmol/L lysophosphatidic acid for 1 hour before infection. RhoA activity in cell extracts were measured using a RhoA G-LISA Activation Assay Kit (Cytoskeleton, Inc).
Transepithelial Electrical Resistance Measurements
Polarized IECs grown on 0.33-cm2 collagen-coated Corning Transwells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were apically infected with EPEC strains (WT, SE874, and SE874/C) cultured in DMEM as described earlier. Measurements were made every hour for 6 hours after infection using an epithelial volt-Ohm voltmeter (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), and transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was calculated by applying Ohm's Law.

Immunofluorescence Microscopy
Cultured monolayers were grown on poly-L-lysine- coated coverslips. For mouse intestinal tissues, samples
were frozen in OCT embedding medium (Tissue-Tek; Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and stored at -80C. Cultured
monolayers and OCT-mounted tissue samples cut at 4-micron thickness were fixed in a 1:1 mixture of methanol and acetone for 20 minutes at -20C, air-dried, rehydrated
in PBS for 5 minutes, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in PBS for 15 minutes, and
blocked with 5% IgG-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) in
PBS for 1 hour. Primary antibodies used for cultured cells
were 1:40 dilution of mouse anti-DSG2 and 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (Abcam); mouse tissues were probed with 1:40 dilution of
rabbit anti-DSG2 (Sigma Aldrich). Samples were incubated with primary antisera overnight at 4C, and then washed 3
times with 1% IgG-free BSA in PBS. Secondary antibodies (Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, or Alexa 488 goat antirabbit IgG antisera; Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added at 8 mg/mL in 5% IgG-free BSA for 1 hour. Samples were washed with PBS, stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole, and mounted in ProLong Diamond Antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were captured on a DeltaVision Elite Deconvolution Microscope (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) using an Olympus 60Â/1.42 objective with 1.59Â auxiliary magnification or an Olympus 100Â/1.4 objective (immersion oil refractive index, n ¼ 1.516) (Sigma-Aldrich).

Mouse Model of EPEC Infection
All procedures were approved by the University of Ari-
zona Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Six-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were infected as reported previously.26 Briefly, streptomycin-treated mice (5 g/L streptomycin in drinking
water ad libitum for 24 hours, followed by sterile water for 24 hours), were gavaged with 150 mL sterile PBS (control, uninfected), or 2 Â 108 bacteria suspended in 150 mL sterile PBS, and monitored for up to 4 days after infection.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
Polarized IECs grown on 0.33-cm2 collagen-coated Transwells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were apically infec-
ted with EPEC strains cultured in DMEM. IECs and tissue samples were fixed in Karnovsky's Fixative (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) overnight at 4C, neutralized with 125 mmol/L glycine in PBS, postfixed in
1% osmium tetroxide, and sequentially dehydrated with
15%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100% ethanol. Samples then were infiltrated with Spurr's Resin (Electron

Results
EspH Mediates Desmoglein-2 Loss in EPEC-Infected Epithelial Cells
To explore the molecular basis for the cell-cell separation previously seen in EPEC-infected patient tissues,19 infected IEC extracts were immunoblotted for the transmembrane, spot-weld protein DSG2, the only desmoglein isoform present in the intestine. We observed substantial DSG2 loss at 3 hours after EPEC infection, but not in mocktreated cells (Figure 1A). Immunofluorescence of mocktreated cells, and cells infected with WT EPEC for up to 1 hour, showed the typical junctional localization of DSG2 noted previously.27 At 2 hours after infection, there was evidence of DSG2 displacement from the cell junctions, and internalization of this protein into the cytosol (Figure 1B); by 3 hours, DSG2 was substantially depleted from infected cells, mirroring the immunoblot results.
In contrast to WT EPEC, an isogenic T3SS-deficient strain (DespA) failed to deplete DSG2 (Figure 2A), suggesting a role for 1 or more secreted effectors in the process. To identify the effector proteins involved, we assessed DSG2 abundance in IECs infected with isogenic EPEC mutants lacking specific effector molecules. EPEC Dmap, Dtir, DespG, DespF, and DespZ caused DSG2 loss similar to the WT strain, ruling out a role for the corresponding effectors in DSG2 downregulation (not shown). A strain lacking EspH (SE874), however, failed to deplete DSG2, and this defect was reversed by espH complementation (SE874/C) (Figure 2B). The major heterotypic partner of DSG2, DSC2, also was depleted in EPEC-infected IECs in an EspH-dependent manner (Figure 2C). Although DSC2 is the primary isoform expressed in the normal intestine, other desmocollin

isoforms have been observed in disease states.28 Therefore, all further studies focus on DSG2, with DSC2 included as a validation control where appropriate. In contrast to WTinfected cells, junctional DSG2 staining was maintained in mock-treated and SE874-infected cells (Figure 2D); complementation (SE874/C) restored the ability of the espH

mutant to displace DSG2 from the junctions and cause its depletion.
Previous studies have shown the perturbation of TJs in EPEC-infected intestinal epithelial cells, notably the displacement of occludin and zonula occludens 1 from the TJ regions.13-17 In some images of intestinal epithelia from

biopsy specimens of EPEC-infected children, however, TJs appeared intact in regions where basolateral unzipping was evident. We therefore used immunofluorescence to assess the temporal relationship between TJ and desmosomal disruptions in EPEC-infected epithelial cells. At 3 hours after infection, occludin staining was restricted primarily to the junctions of infected epithelial cells compared with mocktreated cells (Figure 3A). In contrast, DSG2 is substantially internalized and lost by this time point, suggesting that desmosomal alterations precede TJ disruption.
Because EPEC depletes DSG2 and DSC2, we assessed desmosomal integrity in infected cells via transmission electron microscopy. Densely staining desmosomes tracked along the lateral walls of mock-treated IECs, as well as cells infected with SE874 (Figure 3B). In contrast, WT EPEC- or SE874/C-infected cells had reduced desmosomal staining, areas of unzipping, and junctional separation. Notably, despite separation of the lateral membranes, TJs appeared intact, further indicating that desmosomal perturbations likely precede EPEC-induced TJ disruption. Collectively, these data suggest that EspH induces DSG2 displacement

and loss from cell junctions, leading to desmosomal perturbations and loss of cell-cell contacts.
EPEC EspH Compromises Cell-Cell Adhesion and Epithelial Barrier Function
Because desmosomes are critical scaffolds between the lateral membranes of epithelial cells, we assessed the impact of EPEC-induced DSG2 loss on cell junction strength. Dispasetreated mock-infected and commensal E coli-infected cells, as well as DespA-infected and SE874-infected cells, were displaced from the plastic substratum, but remained as intact sheets (Figure 4A). In contrast, and consistent with EspHdependent DSG2 loss, EPEC-infected and SE874/C-infected monolayers disintegrated into small fragments.
To determine if DSG2 loss impacted barrier function, we monitored infection-mediated TER changes in polarized C2BBe monolayers. WT EPEC induced a progressive decrease in TER relative to mock-treated epithelial cells (Figure 4B). Lack of EspH (SE874) markedly impaired the ability to decrease TER, while complementation (SE874/C) restored

the phenotype. Collectively, this suggests that EspH-induced DSG2 loss and desmosomal perturbations compromise epithelial monolayer integrity, leading to loss of epithelial barrier function.
EspH-Dependent DSG2 Redistribution and Loss Correlates With RhoA Inhibition
EspH (w168 amino acids) is unique to A/E pathogens, and does not show significant sequence similarity to other proteins. EspH interaction with Rho GEFs Dbl homologyplecstrin homology domains inhibits Rho GTPase activation, and perturbs the actin cytoskeletion.29 However, the specific EspH residues involved in these processes remain undefined. To identify EspH domains involved in Rho GTPase inhibition, and in DSG2 relocalization, we generated a panel of alanine-scan mutants. The parent plasmid (encoding WT EspH) and mutant derivatives were used to complement the espH-deficient SE874 strain. Transfected C2BBe cells expressing p115-RhoGEF were infected with this panel of strains, and the extracts were assessed for EspH-p115 RhoGEF interactions. Co-immunoprecipitation studies confirmed interaction of EspH with p115-RhoGEF (Figure 5A); in contrast, 2 alanine-scan mutants, M14 and M16, with replacements of amino acids 88-92 and 98-102, respectively, failed to pull down p115-RhoGEF. The lesions in M14 and M16 did not compromise EspH secretion via the T3SS (Figure 5A).

The corresponding mutants were assessed for their ability to inhibit Rho GTPase activty. WT EPEC, but not SE874, inhibited RhoA activity in IECs (Figure 5B). Complementation of SE874 (SE874/C [¼SE874/pJLR1] or SE874/pJLR4 [His-tagged EspH]) restored the ability to inhibit RhoA. In contrast, the RhoGEF interaction-defective mutants M14 and M16 failed to complement SE874 for RhoA inhibition (Figure 5B). Unlike WT espH-complemented SE874, M14- and M16-complemented SE874 also failed to induce the loss of DSG2, or its major heterotypic partner DSC2 (Figure 5C). Finally, M14 and M16 failed to complement SE874 for monolayer fragmentation, as assessed in the dispase assay (Figure 5D). Host-cell adherence of all strains was comparable with WT EPEC (not shown). These data support a model whereby EPEC EspH-mediated Rho GTPase inhibition promotes internalization and loss of the desmosomal proteins DSG2 and DSC2, causes the separation of the lateral membranes of adjacent cells, and compromises cell-cell adhesion and barrier function.
Mechanism of EspH-Mediated DSG2 Loss in Infected Cells
EspH competitively binds to RhoGEFs and inhibits Rho GTPase activation.29 Although Rho GTPases were implicated in desmosomal protein anchoring to IFs in keratinocytes,30 their contributions to desmosomal integrity in IECs has not been investigated. We therefore explored if Rho

activator II CN03 could rescue RhoA activation and restore DSG2 levels downstream of the EspH-RhoGEF block. CN03 is based on the catalytic domain of cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1, which irreversibly deamidates Gln63 of RhoA and locks it in the active confirmation.31,32 Although EPEC infection depleted DSG2 in infected cells, CN03 treatment restored DSG2 abundance (Figure 6A) and its localization (Figure 6B). CN03 alone did not have discernable impacts on DSG2 abundance or localization in mock-treated cells (Figure 6A and B). This further supports the contention that EspH induces DSG2 loss by inhibiting Rho GTPases.
To our knowledge, there is no known pathway linking Rho GTPases to DSG2 stabilization at cell junctions. Because Rho GTPase activation can stimulate actin polymerization, we considered a role for cytoskeletal modulation in EPECinduced DSG2 down-regulation. The actin cytoskeleton plays a role in maintaining keratin IFs, and facilitates IF anchorage to desmosomes via the cytolinker desmoplakin.33,34 Keratin IF precursors nucleate at desmosomes, and then translocate continuously toward the nucleus until they integrate end-on into the peripheral IF network.35 Importantly, this inward-directed transport of keratin IF precursors depends on actin retrograde flow.36 We therefore hypothesized that EspH-mediated Rho inactivation and consequent actin destabilization impairs the normal actindependent transport of keratin IFs, ultimately disrupting DSG2 and desmosome -anchoring at the junctions. To test this hypothesis, we infected IECs with EPEC strains and visualized IFs (via cytokeratin 8/18 staining) and DSG2. Consistent with our hypothesis, keratin staining was disrupted, or absent, in IECs infected with WT EPEC and SE874/C (Figure 6C); in several cells, the staining was suggestive of IF collapse away from the cell periphery, and toward the nucleus. Keratin staining remained intact, and comparable with mock-treated cells, in SE874-infected IECs (Figure 6C). This suggests that EspH impedes the inwarddirected transport of new and maturing keratin IFs.

Consistent with a role for cytoskeletal perturbation in this process, the actin-stabilizing drug jasplakinolide preserved IF integrity and DSG2 membrane localization in EPEC- and SE874/C-infected cells (Figure 6C). In the absence of infection, jasplakinolide did not impact DSG2 localization or abundance. Together, these data suggest that EspHdependent Rho GTPase inactivation leads to actin depolymerization; this, in turn, perturbs IF stability and, ultimately, leads to destabilization of desmosomes and DSG2 downregulation.
DSG2 Is Internalized and Degraded in the Lysosomes of EPEC-Infected Cells
Destabilized desmosomes can split into halfdesmosomes and be internalized; in keratinocytes, desmogleins are degraded via the lysosomal or proteasomal pathways.37 To assess DSG2 fate in EPEC-infected IECs, we determined the effects of the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 and the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. Bafilomycin A1, but not the vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide, prevented EPECinduced DSG2 loss (Figure 7A). MG132 had no apparent impact on infection-induced DSG2 displacement from the cell junctions to the cytosol (Figure 7B), but partially protected against DSG2 loss (Figure 7A). In contrast, lysosomal inhibition protected against EPEC-induced DSG2 loss (Figure 7A); moreover, DSG2 was internalized, and colocalized with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 in bafilomycin-treated, EPEC-infected IECs (Figure 7B). Taken together, these results suggest that EPEC EspH promotes junctional instability of DSG2, leading to its internalization and subsequent degradation primarily within lysosomes.
We explored 2 alternate pathways for direct DSG2 cleavage in EPEC-infected cells. EspH activates caspase-3, a cysteine-aspartic acid protease involved in programmed cell death.38 EPEC also activates calcium-dependent

nonlysosomal enzymes (calpains), although EspH has not been implicated in this pathway.39 Because DSG2 is a known target of both caspases and calpains,40 we assessed the effects of calpain inhibitor I and the pan-caspase inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk, respectively, on EPEC-induced DSG2 loss. Neither inhibitor impacted infection-induced DSG2 loss, indicating that caspases and calpains are not involved in this process (data not shown).
EspH Contributes to EPEC-Induced DSG2 Relocalization, and to Intestinal Colonization, in a Mouse Model of Infection
Finally, we assessed EPEC-induced DSG2 downregulation and desmosomal perturbation in vivo using a mouse colonization model.26,41 WT EPEC robustly colonized the mouse cecum and colon on days 3 and 4 after infection (Figure 8A). Although SE874 colonization of the cecum and colon were comparable with WT EPEC on day 3 after infection, its levels decreased at both sites by day 4 after infection (Figure 8A), suggesting a role for EspH in EPEC persistence in the mouse intestine. Both strains were shed at comparable levels on days 1-4 after infection (data not shown).
To investigate infection-induced DSG2 alterations in vivo, colonic tissues isolated on day 3 after infection, when WT EPEC and SE874 colonized at comparable levels, were subjected to immunofluorescence staining. In uninfected and SE874-infected mice, DSG2 was distributed uniformly along the colonic epithelial cell junctions (Figure 8B). In colon tissues of EPEC-infected mice, however, DSG2 was relocalized intracellularly into distinct puncta, consistent with our in vitro observations. Electron micrographs images of infected tissues showed separation of the lateral membranes of colonic epithelial cells in WT-infected mice, but not mocktreated or SE874-infected animals (Figure 8C). Notably, as previously seen in infant colon biopsy specimens,19 and in vitro (Figure 4B), basolateral unzipping was evident in EPEC-infected mice even in areas where the TJs appeared unperturbed. Collectively, these data suggest that EspH mediates EPEC-induced DSG2 relocalization from intestinal epithelial junctions, its subsequent loss in the cytosol, and the consequent perturbation of cell-cell contacts. These changes likely contribute to EPEC colonization of the mouse intestine.

Discussion
As its primary virulence strategy, EPEC secretes effector proteins into IECs and alters their physiology.12 We show that the RhoGEF-sequestering effector EspH inhibits RhoA activity and, correspondingly, induces the internalization and degradation of DSG2 and its major heterotypic partner, DSC2. This results in the loss of desmosomal contacts between adjacent cells, weakened cell-cell adhesion, and disruption of epithelial barrier function. The loss of desmosomal contacts could be a precursor to the cell rounding phenotype observed in EspH-expressing cells,29,42 and the epithelial erosion previously seen in infected animal tissues.43 Importantly, the mechanism outlined for EspHdependent DSG2 depletion and desmosomal perturbation may provide a molecular basis for the basolateral junction widening observed in intestinal biopsy specimens from EPEC-infected infants.19
Rho GTPases were implicated in the maintenance of desmosomal integrity of keratinocytes and myocardial cells,30,44-46 but their impact on desmosomes of the very different simple columnar intestinal epithelia is unknown. On the other hand, the effects of Rho GTPase signaling on intestinal epithelial TJs and adherens junctions have been characterized in some detail.47 Our studies provide 2 lines of evidence for a key role for Rho GTPase signaling in maintaining IEC desmosomal junctions: EspH mutants that failed to inhibit RhoA also were unable to perturb desmosomes, and CN03-mediated Rho GTPase activation rescued EPEC-induced DSG2 loss.
EspH-induced Rho GTPase inhibition leads to actin cytoskeleton disruption29; our studies also implicate a role for EspH in perturbing the IF network. Our observations are consistent with a model whereby EspH-mediated Rho GTPase inactivation impedes the actin-dependent, inwarddirected transport of cytokeratins from the periphery to the cell center, leading to IF retraction35,36; this, possibly in conjunction with displacement of the IF-desmosome linker, desmoplakin, induces DSG2 internalization into, and degradation in, lysosomes.33,34 We previously described cytokeratin alterations in EPEC-infected cells partially mediated by EspF.48 EspF therefore also may contribute to desmosomal perturbations. However, given the profound deficiency of cytokeratin and DSG2 perturbations in cells

infected with SE874 (which lacks EspH, but expresses EspF), EspF may have only an ancillary role in this process.
Desmosomal perturbations have been reported in the
context of other intestinal infections, notably with Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia duodenalis, and Campylobacter jejuni.49-51 E histolytica EhCP112 protease cleaves several desmosomal proteins, including DSG2, but the underlying mechanisms for C jejuni- and G duodenalis- mediated desmosomal perturbation are unknown. The current study is a mechanistic characterization of Rhodependent intestinal epithelial desmosomal perturbation. By extension, other enteric pathogens that harbor Rho GTPase-inactivating virulence proteins, such as Clostridium difficile (toxins TcdA and TcdB),52 Vibrio cholerae (MARTX toxin),53 and Yersinia (YopE, YpkA, and YopT)54 may also promote desmosome destabilization. Beyond a possible role in the etiology of infectious diseases, a robust decrease in DSG2 levels was observed in the mucosa of patients with Crohn's disease.45 It is noteworthy that there was an increased abundance of specific pathogenic E coli strains in a subset of Crohn's disease patients; many of these strains disrupt epithelial barrier function, but their impacts on desmosomal junctions have not been explored.55
Our work now adds EspH to the list of EPEC effector proteins that perturb epithelial paracellular permeability.56
The impact of EspH on epithelial barrier function is novel and noteworthy because it suggests a role for desmosomes beyond that of inert scaffolding. Consistent with this hypothesis, small interfering RNA-mediated DSG2 downregulation in IECs alters epithelial barrier function.45 Interestingly, a tandem peptide-mediated stabilization of junctional DSG2 linkages in Caco-2 cells ameliorated TNFa-induced barrier disruption.45 Electron micrographs images of EPEC-infected epithelial cells suggest that DSG2 depletion and separation of lateral cell surfaces precede complete dissociation of TJs. Our data, however, do not rule
out the possibility of a direct impact of EspH-mediated Rho inhibition on TJs, independent of, and in addition to, the desmosomal alterations.
In contrast to our observations, Guttman et al57 noted that desmoglein and desmocollin remain unchanged during EPEC infection in vitro. The differences in experimental conditions between the 2 studies is a likely explanation for this discrepancy. Whereas Guttman et al57 used subconfluent Caco-2 cells, our studies used confluent C2BBe cells that reportedly have maximal cell-junctional DSG2 distribution and stable desmosomes.
Interestingly, Guttman et al57 also did not detect desmoglein redistribution in colonic tissues of mice infected with Citrobacter rodentium. This may well represent a true distinction between EPEC and C rodentium. Unlike the prototype EPEC strain used in this study, C rodentium secretes EspM2 and EspT, which mimic GEF activity for RhoA and Rac1, respectively. These effectors were shown to mitigate some impacts of EspH-mediated Rho GTPase suppression.29,58-60 Consistent with this, C rodentium mutants lacking espH were not impaired for virulence in mouse infection studies, although they fared poorer in competition

experiments with WT C rodentium.61 In contrast, EPEC mutants lacking espH initially colonized the mouse cecum and colon at levels comparable with the parent WT strain (3 days after infection) but were recovered at lower levels on day 4 after infection. EspH-induced barrier perturbations may enhance nutrient flux into the intestine, which, in turn, may facilitate EPEC expansion; alternatively, the concomitant activation of inflammatory responses may deplete commensal organisms and provide EPEC a competitive edge. In a previous study, enterohemorrhagic E coli mutants lacking espH also were shown to be impaired for virulence in a rabbit model of infection.62
A comprehensive understanding of the role of EspH, as well as Rho GTPase inhibition and desmosomal changes in A/ E pathogen virulence, therefore, requires due consideration of the specific model systems, and an appreciation for the cooperative action of effector molecules. In summary, we identified a novel role for EPEC EspH in perturbing intestinal epithelial desmosomal junctions, which likely contributes to disease. Our delineation of the underlying pathway of desmosomal disruption, involving Rho GTPases and the actin cytoskeleton, has broader implications for both normal intestinal function and for various pathologic states.
