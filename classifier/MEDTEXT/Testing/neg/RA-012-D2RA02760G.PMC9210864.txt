To achieve rapid and convenient on-site pretreatment and determination of parathion-methyl, a densityadjusted liquid-phase microextraction with smartphone digital image colorimetry was established to detect parathion-methyl in food samples. In this study, the environmentally friendly biomass-derived solvent guaiacol was used as the extractant. Salt and water, as density regulators, realized the two movements (floating-sinking) of the extractant and full contact between the extractant and the sample solution to establish an environmentally friendly, fast, and efficient pretreatment method. Under strong alkaline conditions, parathion-methyl generated a yellow product; then, a smartphone was used to obtain the image of the yellow product for intensity analysis. Parathion-methyl has a good linear relationship in the range of 0.01-1 mg LÀ1, and the limits of detection and quantification are 0.003 and 0.01 mg LÀ1, respectively. This method has been successfully applied to the determination of parathionmethyl in spiked water, fruit juice, vinegar, and fermented liquor with a recovery of 91.6-106.5% and a relative standard deviation of 0.6-6.0%. The established density-adjusted liquid phase microextraction with smartphone digital image colorimetry is rapid, convenient, and environmentally friendly for the determination of parathion-methyl in food samples.

1. Introduction
Organophosphate pesticides have been widely applied in agricultural production since their discovery.1 Parathion-methyl is a widely used organophosphate pesticide2 that is related to acute toxicity through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase in the nervous system.3 Parathion-methyl is also classied as a toxicity category I (extremely toxic) insecticide by the WHO and U.S. EPA with a median lethal dose (LD50) value of <5 mg kgÀ1.4,5 The excessive and inappropriate use of parathionmethyl causes the accumulation of pesticides in food products. Therefore, it is challenging and urgent to control parathionmethyl residues. The fast and convenient determination method of parathion-methyl in foods should be exploited to ensure food safety.

Liquid phase microextraction (LPME) is an emerging sample preparation technique with the advantages of versatility, adaptability, and low solvent usage.6 However, the extraction solvents used in LPME are usually volatile and ammable and may pose threats to human health. Another disadvantage of LPME is the use of dispersants and auxiliary extraction equipment (microwave,7 ultrasound,8 vortex,9 and stirring). The disadvantages of the use of acetone,10 acetonitrile,11 and methanol12 as dispersants are known to be hazardous to operators and the environment.13 The disadvantage of the use of microwave, ultrasound, vortex, and stirring as auxiliary equipment are known to be inconvenient and unsuitable for on-site detection. Therefore, it is worth paying attention to replacing traditional toxic organic solvents with environmentally friendly alternative solvents and establishing LPME without dispersants and auxiliary equipment.
Ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents are considered environmentally friendly organic extraction solvents14 compared with carbon tetrachloride, toluene, and hexane in LPME.15,16 However, they require time-consuming synthesis and are easily destroyed during the LPME process. Biomass-derived solvents are liquids obtained from renewable resources,17 which bear the key advantages of being derived from renewable resources.18 They have the advantages of low toxicity,

availability, renewability, biodegradability, and reasonable prices.17 Therefore, it is environmentally friendly to use biomassderived solvents instead of toxic organic solvents.
Methanol, acetonitrile, and acetone are oen used as dispersants, which are combined with microwave, ultrasonic, vortex, and stirring equipment to achieve full contact between the extractant and the samples and assist extraction. Emerging extraction methods use the principle of relative movement to achieve full contact between the extractant and the samples, which achieves environmentally friendly, fast, and efficient extraction without the use of dispersants and auxiliary equipment.
If an extractant with a similar density to the sample is designed, the movement of the extractant and full contact of the extractant with the sample solution can be achieved by adjusting the density of the extractant or sample. The biomass-derived solvent guaiacol has similar density to water, so guaiacol can be considered a good choice. There are two main methods for density adjustment: to adjust the density of the extractant and to adjust the density of the sample. The density of the extractant can be changed by adding heavy or light solvents that are miscible with the extractant, but it will increase the volume of organic solvents and decrease the sensitivity of the method. Meanwhile, the density of the sample can be easily adjusted only by adding common salts and water to realize the two movements (oating-sinking) of the extractant and LPME. Therefore, the proposed density-adjusted LPME method is fast and efficient compared to the traditional LPME method.
Current detection methods of parathion-methyl mainly involve gas chromatography,19 high-performance liquid chromatography,20 mass spectrometry,21 and electrochemical methods.22 However, expensive equipment, long analysis times, and well-trained operators are required. Colorimetry has the advantages of simple operation, fast quantication, etc.23 Under strong alkaline conditions, parathion-methyl produces a yellow substance, which is suitable for colorimetry. Emerging digital image colorimetry involves two steps: image acquisition and color readout.24 In recent years, digital image colorimetry has gained attention due to its low cost in rapid real-time quantitative determination. Digital image colorimetry has been used to determine pesticides,25 veterinary drugs,24 and heavy metals.26 Digital image colorimetry can be performed by transferring the captured images into the computer for further

analysis by soware (e.g., Image J).27 Alternatively, it can be performed by in-built or open-source applications in smartphones (e.g., Color Grab, Photometrix etc.) to directly pick the color data.28 Because smartphone cameras can distinguish small changes in colors with small measurement errors and more accurate results, smartphone are considered an excellent image acquisition tool.29 Smartphone digital image colorimetry (SDIC) oen utilizes RGB color space (red, green, and blue), where any color can be divided into the three basic colors and read out by smartphone soware.28 It is convenient, fast, low cost, portable, and suitable for on-site analysis30 and has a wide range of application prospects in food analysis.
The purpose of the established method is to realize fast, convenient, and environmentally friendly on-site pretreatment and visual determination of parathion-methyl in food samples. The density-adjusted LPME method was rst established and combined with SDIC to quantitatively analyze parathion-methyl in spiked water, fruit juice, vinegar, and fermented liquor.
2. Experimental
2.1 Reagents and materials
Parathion-methyl (98.2%) was obtained from ANPEL-TRACE Standard Technical Services Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Guaiacol, methanol, KCl, NaCl, Na2SO4, NaNO3, trimethylhexylammonium bromide (C9H22NBr), and NaOH were obtained from Aladdin Industrial Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Water, cherry juice, vinegar, and fermented liquor were purchased from local markets (Jinzhong, Shanxi).
2.2. Apparatus
The Xiaomi 10S smartphone was purchased from Xiaomi Technologies Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). A free application Color Grab (Loomatix, version 3.6.1, 2017), which was available for Android systems, was used to convert the images to RGB values.
2.3 Microextraction and detection procedure
The extraction and detection procedure are shown in Fig. 1. Then, 150 mL of colorless extraction solvent guaiacol was added into 5 mL of the sample solution in a 10 mL centrifuge tube. Aer 1500 mg of KCl was added, guaiacol oated from the bottom to

the top of the sample solution. Aer 4000 mL of water was added, the extractant sunk to the bottom of the centrifuge tube again.
The extractant was collected into another 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, which contained 100 mL of C9H22NBr (10 mol LÀ1) and 100 mL of sodium hydroxide solution (10 mol LÀ1) to generate yellow product in situ (Fig. S1). The yellow organic phase was placed in the middle of an opaque white box (30 cm Â 30 cm Â 30 cm). The top of the box was surrounded by LED light panels to provide an isotropic lighting. Moreover, a small hole (diameter, 5 cm) was formed in the centre of the top to allow photography. The change in colour was captured by Xiaomi 10S smartphone with 108 Megapixel, then the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) channel values of the middle pixel region were read in RGB mode with Color Grab application. The RGB intensity (I) was calculated by the formula: I ¼ 1/B.
2.4. Calculation of extraction recovery
The recovery was calculated to evaluate the proposed method as follows.

CFound is the total concentration of parathion-methyl aer the addition of a known amount of parathion-methyl to the sample; CReal is the original concentration of parathion-methyl in the sample; CAdded is the concentration of parathion-methyl added to the real samples.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Optimization of extraction conditions
The volume of the extractant, type and volume of salt added, volume of water added, and sample volume were optimized to

ascertain the best extraction parameters to use. Each experi-
ment was repeated three times. 3.1.1 Effect of the volume of extractant. The volume of the
extractant has a critical role in the recovery of analytes.31 The experiment investigated the effect of different volumes of guaiacol (50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200 mL) on the extraction efficiency (Fig. 2). The extraction efficiency signicantly increased with increasing extractant volume from 50 to 150 mL. When the volume of extractant was more than 150 mL, the extraction efficiency decreased. The reason may be that inadequate extraction solvent leads to insufficient extraction. An
excess volume of extraction solvent may cause small droplets to not be properly formed.32 The increase in the volume of extraction solvent results in the dilution effect. Therefore, 150 mL of guaiacol was used in subsequent experiments.
3.1.2 Effect of the type of salt added. The addition of salt
helps increase the density of the sample solution. The experiment investigated the effect of different types of salt (KCl, NaCl, Na2SO4, and NaNO3) on the extraction efficiency (Fig. 3). KCl had the best extraction efficiency, possibly because the saltingout effect and density affect the extraction efficiency. Therefore,
KCl was used in subsequent experiments. 3.1.3 Effect of the amount of salt added. The experiment
investigated the effect of different amounts of KCl added (1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, and 1800 mg) on the extraction efficiency (Fig. 4). The extraction efficiency increased with
increasing amounts of KCl added from 1300 to 1500 mg. The
reason may be that the salt addition improves the extractant
movement and the contact between sample and extractant. When more than 1500 mg KCl was added, the extraction effi-
ciency decreased, possibly because the increased viscosity of the solution decreases the efficiency of the mass-transfer process due to the viscous resistance effect.33 Therefore, 1500 mg of KCl
was used in subsequent experiments.

Fig. 4 Optimization of the amount of added salt.

Fig. 5 Optimization of the volume of added water.

3.1.4 Effect of added water. In the density adjustment process, the volume of added water affects the sinking of the extractant and distribution of the analyte. The experiment investigated the effect of different volumes of added water (3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500, and 6000 mL) on the extraction efficiency (Fig. 5). The extraction efficiency reaches the maximum with increasing volume of added water to 4000 mL. Subsequently, when the volume of added water continues to increase, the extraction efficiency decreases. The reason may be that the added water increases the sinking speed of the extractant and the contact between sample and extractant. Excess water can reduce the extraction efficiency due to the redistribution of parathion-methyl into the sample. Therefore, 4000 mL of water was added for subsequent experiments.
3.1.5 Effect of the sample volume. In the density adjustment process, the different sample volumes may affect the extraction efficiency and method sensitivity. The experiment investigated the effect of different sample volume (3, 4, 5, and 6

mL) on the extraction efficiency (Fig. S2). There were no signicant differences for the extraction recovery of parathionmethyl with sample volume from 3 to 6 mL. Therefore, in order to make the experimental extraction process more convenient, 5 mL sample volume was selected for further experiments.
3.2 Method validation
To validate the performance of the proposed method, the linear range (LR), correlation coefficients (R), limits of detection (LOD), limits of quantication (LOQ), and intraday and interday relative standard deviation (RSDs) of the established method were evaluated, and the results are shown in Table 1 under the optimal extraction conditions (Table 1).
In this experiment, parathion-methyl had good linearity in the linear range of 0.01-1 mg LÀ1, with RGB intensity (I) as the ordinate and concentration as the abscissa (Fig. 6). The slope of

3.3 Anti-interference test
To validate the anti-interference performance of the proposed method, the specicity of the proposed method was investigated by preparing and analyzing samples spiked with different insecticides (parathion-methyl, bifenthrin, deltamethrin, clothianidin, dinotefuran, thiacloprid, acetamiprid, pronil). The result showed that other insecticides did not cause interference with the determination of parathion-methyl (Fig. S3).

3.4 Applicability
The analytical applicability of the developed method to food samples (water, fruit juice, vinegar, and fermented liquor) was evaluated. The parathion-methyl in the real samples was below detectable levels. Thus, to verify the accuracy and precision of the method, different known concentrations of parathionmethyl were spiked in real samples. The analysis results in Table 2 show that the spiked recovery in real samples was 91.6- 106.5%, and the RSDs were 0.6-6.0%. Therefore, the proposed method has good reproducibility and precision.

experiment was validated using the GB23200.113 method. The proposed method was accurate and reliable, and was deemed trustworthy for the detection and monitoring the level of parathion-methyl concentration in food samples.
3.5 Comparison with other methods
The method, solvent, extraction equipment, auxiliary extraction time, LOD, recovery, and instrument were compared to other determination methods of parathion-methyl19,20,34-36 (Table 3). The proposed method uses a small volume of environmentally friendly extraction solvent. No extraction equipment is involved, which makes the method faster and more convenient. A favorable LOD and recovery were achieved without chromatography or mass spectrometry. The proposed method is fast, convenient, and environmentally friendly.
4. Conclusions
In this study, density-adjusted LPME with the SDIC method was established to quickly determine parathion-methyl in food samples. In the pretreatment process, the biomass-derived solvent guaiacol was used as the green extractant, and salt and water were used as the density regulators to exclude the use of toxic dispersants and auxiliary equipment. In the detection process, parathion-methyl generated a yellow product under strongly alkaline conditions; then, a smartphone was used to obtain the image of the yellow organic phase for quantitative analysis. This method is fast, convenient, and environmentally friendly and has been successfully used to determine parathionmethyl in spiked water, fruit juice, vinegar, and fermented liquor. Therefore, this method can be applied to rapidly determine and screen parathion-methyl on-site in different food samples.
