A new species of the genus Xenophrys (Anura: Megophryidae) from northern Thailand

DEAR EDITOR,
Species of Xenophrys are conserved morphologically and live primarily in forests. In Thailand, the genus harbors many cryptic species. Herein we report the collection of specimens from Doi Inthanon, Chiang Mai Province, northern Thailand, which were identified previously as X. minor. Molecular and morphological analyses find that these specimens differ significantly from other known congeners, and therefore we describe a new species. Further, our phylogenetic analyses indicate that X. latidactyla is a junior synonym of X. palpebralespinosa.
The Indo-Burma and Sundaland biodiversity hotspots span Thailand and host a high diversity of amphibian species (Myers et al., 2000). In Thailand, at least 32 of 193 species of amphibians appear to be endemic (Frost, 2019). Some recent studies of Megophrys sensu lato, Leptobrachella and Fejervarya have shown that the diversity of amphibians in Thailand is underestimated (Chen et al., 2017, 2018; Suwannapoom et al., 2016). Further, 10 new species of amphibians have been discovered in the past three years alone (Frost, 2019; Pawangkhanant et al., 2018; Poyarkov et al., 2018; Suwannapoom et al., 2018). Thus, the extensively rich amphibian diversity in Thailand appears to remain underestimated. Like many other regions, high rates of deforestation owe to increased development (Royal Forest Department, 2006) and this drives a high risk of extinction even before the discovery of new species.
Genus Xenophrys Günther, 1864 (family Megophryidae) occurs in the southern and eastern Himalayas, Indochina, and northward to the Qinling and Huangshan mountains of mainland China (Chen et al., 2017). Of the 66 species, Thailand has seven species only: X. aceras, X. lekaguli, X. longipes, X. major, X. minor, X. parva and X. takensis (Chan-

ard, 2003; Mahony, 2011; Nutphund, 2001; Stuart et al., 2006). Xenophrys minor Stejneger was described originally from Kwanghsien (now Guan Xian, Dujiangyan City), 55 kilometers northwest of Chengtu (Chengdu), Szechwan (Sichuan), China. Several researchers recorded it for montane areas of northern Thailand (Chan-ard, 2003; Chuaynkern & Chuaynkern, 2012; Nabhitabhata et al., 2000; Nabhitabhata and Chan-ard, 2005). Several recent publications revised the X. minor complex (Li et al., 2014; Mahony et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2012). Further, the type locality occurs in Sichuan, China and a distance of over 1 500 km separates them from the known localities in northern Thailand. Thus, the taxonomic status of Thai populations previously referred to as X. minor requires further investigations.
Our recent fieldwork in Thailand resulted in the collection of specimens of Xenophrys cf. "minor" from Chiang Mai Province (Doi Inthanon). Further phylogenetic analyses of mtDNA sequences and morphological examinations showed that this species is distantly related to X. minor from China and can be distinguished from all known congeners both by molecular and morphological characters. Based on an integrative taxonomic approach, we describe this population as a new

species of the genus Xenophrys. Six individuals were collected from Doi Inthanon, Chiang
Mai Province, Thailand in August 2017 (Figure 1). After specimens were euthanized using benzocaine, liver tissue was taken and preserved in 95% alcohol. The specimens were fixed with 10% formalin for 24 hours and subsequently transferred to 70% ethanol. All specimens were deposited in the herpetological collection of the Museum of the Kunming Institute of Zoology (KIZ), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and University of Phayao (AUP). Six preserved adult specimens were examined and measured to the nearest 0.1 mm using digital calipers. Morphological terminology followed Fei et al. (2009) and Poyarkov et al. (2017) (Supplementary Methods).

Whole genomic DNA was extracted, and a partial fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA were amplified and sequencing. DNA extraction, primers and PCR cycle protocols are in Supplementary Methods. Matrilineal genealogies were reconstructed to study the phylogenetic relationships among Xenophrys based on the partial mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. Homologous sequences of related species of Xenophrys, and those of the outgroups Leptobrachella oshanensis, L. ventripunctata, Leptobrachium boringii, Megophrys nasuta, and M. baluensis, were downloaded from GenBank (Supplementary Table S1). Trees were reconstructed using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) (Supplementary Methods). Apart from tree-based methods, we also calculated row pairwise sequence divergence using uncorrected p-distances implemented in MEGA v6.0.6 (Tamura et al., 2013).
The results of the ML and BI analyses yielded essentially identical topologies with relatively high nodal support values for most terminal nodes (Figure 2). The tree resolved monophyly of Xenophrys with two major lineages, corresponding to the subgenera Xenophrys sensu stricto and Panophrys (Figure 2). Xenophrys cf. "minor" from Chiang Mai

Province assigned to Panophrys and phylogenetic relationships within which remained essentially unresolved. The Chiang Mai population of Xenophrys cf. "minor" was a strongly supported lineage (BPP=1, BS=100; Figure 2), which different notably from X. minor sensu stricto from China (Figure 2). Genetic distance between the Chiang Mai population and other species of Xenophrys ranged from 4.5% (X. rubrimera, subgenus Panophrys) to 14.4% (X. mangshanensis, subgenus Xenophrys) (Supplementary Table S2). The tree nested X. latidactyla within the radiation of X. palpebralespinosa with high support (BPP=1.0, BS=94) (Figure 2). The genetic divergence between X. latidactyla and X. palpebralespinosa was 0.9%.
The Chiang Mai population of Xenophrys cf. "minor" differs in a number of taxonomically important diagnostic characters from other congeners, including X. minor from China. Thus, both mtDNA and morphological analyses clearly indicate that this population represents a separately evolving lineage and an undescribed species, which we describe below.

Male secondary sexual characteristics: The new species shows slight differences in body size between the sexes: females have slightly larger SVL (37.5 - 39.2 mm, mean 38.3 mm; n=4) than males (31.2-32.1 mm, mean 31.7 mm; n= 2). All adult males have nuptial pads pinkish-red in life covering the dorsal surface of the base of FI. Male has external, single subgular vocal sac with slit-like openings at posterior corners of jaws and a prominent protruding projection posterior to cloaca (Figure 4).
Distribution and ecology: Xenophrys angka sp. nov. is currently known only from Doi Inthanon, Chiang Mai province, Thailand (Figure 1) at elevations from 1800 to 2200 m a. s. l. along forest cascade streams and waterfalls. Most males were

located by calls made while sitting on vegetation 1-2 m from the stream; females were recorded in forest litter along the streams. Xenophrys angka sp. nov. appears to be a strict forest specialist, restricted to patches of undisturbed montane evergreen forests and is likely endemic to the Doi Inthanon - Thanon Thong Chai Range. It inhabits forest floor, leaf litter and the nearby undergrowth rocky mountainous surrounded by moist evergreen broadleaved forests. The new species was found in sympatry with Leptobrachium huashen Fei et Ye and Limnonectes taylori Matsui, Panha, Khonsue et Kuraishi.
Comparisons: We compared Xenophrys angka sp. nov. with their 66 known congeners on the basis of morphology. Comparisons with each subgenus are discussed separately below.

with surrounding regions on males (vs. groin coloration not contrasting with surrounding regions on males in X. feii, Yang et al., 2018), and nuptial pads present on finger I (vs. absent in X. feii, Yang et al., 2018).
The diversity of Xenophrys is underestimated greatly (Chen et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018). In the last three years, 19 new species were described mostly from China, Vietnam and India (Li et al., 2018; Mahony et al., 2018; Messenger et al., 2019; Tapley et al., 2017, 2018Wang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017). Compared to other countries in the Indochinese region, the diversity of Xenophrys in Thailand attracted less attention and no new species were described for the country within the last seven years. Herein, we describe a new species of Xenophrys from northern Thailand based on morphological and molecular analyses. Our discovery increases the number of amphibian species recorded in Thailand to 194, and the species number of Xenophrys to 27. The diversity of amphibians known from Thailand has increased remarkably from 125 (Khonsue and Thirakhupt, 2001) to 193 (Frost, 2019) and the diversity remains underestimated (Chan et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2017, 2018; Grismer et al., 2016; Laopichienpong et al., 2016; Matsui et al., 2018; Pawangkhanant et al., 2018; Poyarkov et al., 2018; Sheridan & Stuart, 2018; Suwannapoom et al., 2017; Suwannapoom et al., 2018). Further field surveys and taxonomic studies on the Thai herpetofauna will likely result in further discoveries of yet unknown lineages and species of amphibians.
Our study also elucidates taxonomic status of Xenophrys latidactyla (Orlov et al., 2015), which a recently described from northern Vietnam. It was described as a member of Megophrys sensu lato based on a single male specimen collected from Pu Mat National Park in south-western Nghe An Province. Orlov et al. (2015) indicated that this species is most closely resembles X. palpebralespinosa, inhabiting montane areas of northern Vietnam (recorded from provinces Lao Cai, He Giang, Cao Bang, Vinh Phuc, Son La, Thanh Hoa, Nge An) and northern Laos, eastern part of Yunnan and the westernmost part of Guangxi, China (Bourret, 1937, 1942; Fei et al., 2009, 2010Orlov et al., 2015; Tapley et al., 2017). The main morphological differences of these two species were the presence of very wide dermal fringes along all length of the toes in X. latidactyla (vs. broad dermal fringes absent in X. palpebralespinosa), presence of prominent subarticular tubercles in X. latidactyla (vs. absent), and differences in tympanum size. Our mtDNA genealogy unambiguously places two specimens of X. latidactyla, including the type specimen ZISP 12182, within radiation of X. palpebralespinosa from northern Vietnam and Laos. The genetic divergence between X. latidactyla and X. palpebralespinosa is small, ranging from 0.3% - 1.4%, suggesting that these two taxa might be conspecific. Morphological differences that were used by Orlov et al. (2015) to diagnose these species might be subject to significant variation, which was not assessed due to small sample size (n=1): feet webbing and dermal fringes on toes in X. palpebralespinosa are normally significantly reduced out of the breeding season and get enlarged during the reproduction

(personal observation); the reported distinct subarticular tubercles in X. latidactyla might be the result of partial dehydration of limbs due to preservation in ethanol. Thus, no unambiguous morphological or molecular characters distinguishing these two species. Therefore, we transfer X. latidactyla to the synonymy of X. palpebralespinosa as a subjective junior synonym. Further, this result indicates that molecular analyses are essential in assessing species diversity of Xenophrys, and megophryids in general.
