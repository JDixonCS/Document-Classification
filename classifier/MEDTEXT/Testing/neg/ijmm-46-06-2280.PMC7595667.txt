After the publication of the above article, the authors have realized that Figs. 2 and 4 in their paper were published with incorrect images; regarding Fig. 2, the data featured in Fig. 2A (for the H/SD + Nico 1000 µM panel) were repeated with those featured in Fig. 1C (the 6 h H/SD panel), and the data shown for Bcl-2 in Fig. 4C were selected incorrectly. These errors arose inadvertently as a consequence of misassembling the figures.
The revised versions of Figs. 2 and 4, featuring the corrected data panels for the abovementioned experiments, are shown on the next page. Note that the revised data shown for these Figures do not affect the overall conclusions reported in the paper. The authors express their gratitude to the Editor of International Journal of Molecular Medicine for allowing them the opportunity to publish this corrigendum, and apologize to the readership for any inconvenience caused.

Figure 2. Nicorandil protects MSCs against H/SD-induced apoptosis. Cells were pre-incubated with nicorandil (10-1,000 µM) for 1 h in complete medium prior to exposure to H/SD. Apoptosis was reduced by nicorandil in a dose-dependent manner, as assessed using (A and B) flow cytometry and (C and D) western blot analysis. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of 3 separate experiments. *P<0.05, compared with the normal group; P<0.05, compared with the H/SD control group. MSCs, mesenchymal stem cells; H/SD, hypoxia/serum deprivation; Nico, nicorandil; Cl.caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3.
Figure 4. Nicorandil exerts anti-apoptotic effects by stabilizing MMP. Western blot analysis revealed that nicorandil induced a significant increase in (C and D) the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, with a concomitant decrease in (A-D) the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and cytochrome c, as well as apoptosisrelated (E and F) capsase-3, and these effects were reversed by LY294002 [an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)]. (G) Nicorandil exerted a significant inhibitory effect on mitochondrial dysfunction, as verified by JC-1 staining. Data are presented as the means ± SD of 3 separate experiments. *P<0.05, compared with the normal group; P<0.05, compared with the 100 µM nicorandil-treated group. H/SD, hypoxia/serum deprivation; Nico, nicorandil; MMP, mitochondrial membrane potential; mito.cytC, mitochondrial cytochrome c; cyto.cytC, cytosolic cytochrome c; Cl.caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3.
