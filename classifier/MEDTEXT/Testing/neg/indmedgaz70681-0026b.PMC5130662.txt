THE INTERIOR. ECONOMY OF ARMY HOSPITALS IN INDIA.
TO THE EDITOR OE THE " INDIAN MEDICAL GAZETTE."
Sib,?With reference to Surgeon-Major G. J. H. Evatt's notes on the interior economy of army hospitals in India, published in the Indian Medical Gazette of 1st February 1878 for criticism, I would beg to make a few remarks.
It would appear to me that Surgeon-Major Eyatt's experience in the working, generally, of army hospitals in India is very limited, as the system said to exist by him is very different to what I have experienced, as will be seen fur-
ther on.
As regards a book of standing orders, we have a Code of Regulations, and there has always been one, as far as I can find, even in the East Indian Company's time. The present Code fully details the duties of all the European subordinates employed in hospitals. As regards the natives, they are employed for special duties, viz., the compounder and dresser to assist in the dispensary, the cooks to cook, the bhisties to supply water, the sweeper to sweep and look after the latrines, and the coolies to attend the sick in the capacity of nurses. To employ them for
other purposes would be wrong.
Tlie question of an " Army Hospital Corps" in India, is already before the Government, as I think was made known to all hospitals by a Circular from the Surgeon-General some
months ago.
I believe also that the subject of doing away with the Purveyor as a Commissariat Agent was also brought before the Government with certain propositions, which would bring the purveying directly under the medical officer, and much improve it generally. The result I am not aware of.
I cannot follow Dr. Evatt in believing that putting a lot of men through a course of company drill would make them more obedient and respectful ; obedience and respect depend on other conditions of greater importance than mechanical drilling.
Dr. Evatt proposes two coolies to each ward of 16 men,
and requires certain duties of them, (to attend the men's meals, issue their extras, nurse them generally, and apply the minor dressings, besides keeping the room in a clean tidy state). I am afraid that two men, however well-trained, would not be equal to the work of a ward of 16 sick ; if, for instance, there happen to be a few cases in the ward requiring poultices or fomentations every three or four hours, more especially as the soldier in hospital in India is not made to assist in cleaning and tidying his ward as he is at home. Again, Dr. Evatt would do away with all the dispensary servants, and apparently make the medical subordinate perform all the menial offices connected with dispensing, as well as the dispensing itself. In a regimental hospital two dispensary servants capable of assisting in the dispensary and of applying the simpler dressings in the wards, are, to my thinking, absolutely necessary ; all dispensing and preparing of drugs should certainly be done by a qualified medical subordinate, and this is, in many hospitals, insisted on.
Again, it is distinctly laid down in the Eegu'ations that all medical subordinates should appear in uniform when on duty. The question of a uniform for natives has not as yet been settled by Government.
I have never known in my service, extending over 19 years, and in every description of army hospital in India, it to be the practice for the ward cooly to take each patient's bed head ticket separately to the kitchen for his meal. It is customary for the diets of each ward to be brought up in bulk to a convenient spot in the verandah of the ward or dining hall by the cooks, and from there each patient's diet is separated and taken by the ward coolies to the table.
The baker referred to is not usually a baker, but a commissariat servant, and does not distribute the bread, but simply carries it round, while the head cook distributes it, as also tho milk and butter. They might be carried by hospital servants if it did not interfere with their other duties.
I have never known the dhobies to enter tho wards under
any pretence, not even when they were hospital servants, before the existence of the purveyor in Bengal.
The ward cooly receives the clean clothing from the clothier, at the purveyor's godown and takes it to the ward ; he also returns the soiled to the clothier at the godown, tho dhoby having to do with none outside the purveyor's establishment.

MEDICAL NEWS.

The wards are already, as far as practicable, separate tmits. I have always known, in every hospital, each ward to have its own medical subordinate, European orderly (generally) coolies and sweepers, which could easily be detached from the regimental hospital without any inconvenience to the sick or working.
Every medical subordinate, before being entrusted with the case of a ward, must be pronounced qualified by a medical board ; the dieting of the sick and preparation of all hospital returns being part of the qualification necessary at his passing.
The form of diet roll suggested by Dr. Evatt to be kept Tin in each ward, is very simiiar to the old nominal diet roll, brought into use in 1862, and became obsolete in 1875 or 1876. I agree with him in this, and believe tlie nominal diet roll should never have been done away with : it was very useful for reference, containing each man's diets and extras for the month, and was always a ready check on the monthly diet roll, and an office record after the tickets of such as were receiving supplementary extras were sent nway from the office.
From these observations, which are founded on practical experience, I venture to hope that your readers will conclude that the interior economy of army hospitals in India is not so complicated and awkward as Dr. Evatt has represented.
I am,
Sir, Yours. &c.,
Gallipot.
