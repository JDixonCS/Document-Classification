In the present paper, we have attempted an analysis of the cases of epidemic dropsy admitted into the Carmichael Hospital for Tropical Diseases from the time of its opening in 1922
to the end of the year 1933. During this period
a total of 131 cases of the disease were admitted; of these the largest number, i.e., 39, was admitted in the severe epidemic year of 1926. In 1932 when the epidemic was also fairly severe 23 cases were admitted and treated. In between these two epidemic years, we had a slight rush of patients in 1929, when the admission curve (vide annual curve) rose above the average. In other years, the admissions were below the average except in 1924 when the curve just
touched it with 11 admissions. The period
under review is too short to draw any conclusion regarding -the periodicity of the epidemics, but certain points in the curve are striking. The curve consists of a series of sharp peaks and deep valleys; there is no high plateau anywhere
in the curve. This shows that a severe epidemic in a year was usually followed by a period of quiescence.
Seasonal incidence.?A grouping of the cases month by month shows some interesting
features.
Here a short statement regarding the seasonal variations of this province will not be out of place. Between the months of November and February Bengal ha* very little rainfall while the prevalent wind is the dry and cold north-western monsoon. During the month> of March, April, May and the first two weeks of June, the province is visited by heavy thunderstorms; the prevalent wind during this period is the hot and comparatively humid south-eastern monsoon.

showed a proportionately large number of Bengali Christians admitted for this disease.
Symptoms.?The patients admitted showed a variety of symptoms during the onset. The commonest of these were oedema (66), diarrhoea (41) and fever (25); many of the patients showed a combination of the above symptoms. Eleven patients started the disease with heart symptoms; of these six complained of palpitation, four of dyspnoea and one of cardiac pain. One patient complained of vague pains in the abdomen at the outset, another had a red rash on the lower limbs and two had severe pains in
the legs. The main symptoms manifested by the
patients are grouped under the following heads: (1) oedema, (2) diarrhoea, (3) fever, (4) cardiac symptoms, (5) nervous symptoms, (6) cutaneous symptoms, and (7) eye symptoms.
(Edema.?This was the commonest manifes-
tation of the disease in this series and, out of
the total of 131 cases, 125 suffered from oedema
some time or other during the course of their
illness. The commonest sites were the lower
extremities, but very often the hands and the
trunk were also affected. The oedema was
usually of solid type especially in the early stages. Tenderness and redness of the affected parts were common features.
Diarrhoea.?Eighteen patients suffered from diarrhoea at the onset only and 47 cases suffered from it off and on during the course of the illness. Only 13 patients had constipation. The incidence of diarrhoea was more common during the severe epidemic years when more acute cases were admitted into the hospital. For instance, 65 per cent of patients had diarrhoea in 1927, 70 per cent in 1929 and 56 per cent in 1932, while the average percentage of diarrhoea in nonepidemic years was 27 per cent only.
Fever.?Out of 131 patients in this series, 94 had some rise of temperature during the course of the disease, while 37 were absolutely
afebrile. Out of these 94 cases, 9 had
short periods of fever during the onset only, but the majority (60 in this series) ran a low irregularly-intermittent temperature during the progress of the illness; the temperature settled down with the amelioration of other symptoms. In 12 patients the temperature instead of being intermittent was of a low remittent type. One patient had a high remittent fever for a short period due to an intercurrent attack of influenza. Three patients in 1932 had a high irregular temperature, and in two of these malarial parasites were found in the blood. In seven cases the temperature curves showed an occasional high rise and of these four proved to be
due to malarial infection. One severe case in
1826 ran an up-and-down temperature of a septic type. As in case of diarrhoea the percentage of patients suffering from fever also increased during the epidemic years, being 66 per cent, 92 per cent and 95 per cent in 1926,

1929 and 1932, respectively. The average percentage of fever in non-epidemic years was 38.
Cardiac symptoms.?An analysis of the cardiac manifestations showed multifarious symptoms. For convenience the patients were classified into four broad groups, (1) those with grave symptoms, (2) those with moderately severe symptoms, (3) those with slight symptoms, and (4) those in which no cardiac symptoms were present. Those patients who showed intense venous engorgement, dilated heart, embryonic rhythm, orthopncea and similar symptoms of acute cardiac failure were classified as grave; those classified as moderate had such symptoms as dyspnoea on slight exertion, palpitation, systolic bruit, moderate dilatation of the heart and other signs of partial failure. Those classed as slight only complained of occasional palpitation, without any detectable organic defect; a few patients had no cardiac trouble
at all. In this series there were 13 patients
with no cardiac symptoms, 19 cases with slight, 66 with moderate, and 33 with marked evidence of cardiac insufficiency.
As has been observed in two previous papers (Chopra and Basu, 1930, and Chopra and Bose, 1933) the chief cardiovascular symptoms of this disease are anaemia and tachycardia which arc fairly constantly present, their degree varying with the severity of the disease.
Nervous symptoms. Knee jerks.?In 59 patients there was no alteration in the knee jerks; in two they were diminished; in 17 they were lost. Both knee jerks were increased in 39 patients, while in 14 patients they were manifestly unequal.
Other nervous manifestations were pain and
tenderness in the limbs and these were present
in 47 patients in this series. Only in three
cases weakness and numbness of the lower
extremities were complained of. Cutaneous symptoms.?General flushing of
the skin and a petechial rash of the affected
limbs and often over the trunk were the com-
monest skin conditions met with, and in this
series there were 26 of the former and 13 of the
latter. Another interesting skin manifestation was the appearance of tiny scarlet nsevoid growths, ' sarcoids '. Six patients of this series showed these growths in their bodies. The cutaneous symptoms were comparatively more prominent in the epidemics of 1926 and 1932 and during both these years 48 per cent of the patients showed these lesions.
Eye symptoms.?In some epidemics series of ophthalmoscopic examinations were carried out. Seven patients showed cupping of the disc, three patients had retinal haemorrhage and one engorgement of the retinal veins. In two patients the only ocular symptom was an
increased tension. Laboratory examinations.?Routine examina-
tions of the stools and the blood of the patients
were carried out for any concurrent pathological

condition. Hookworm ova were found in 28

cases, while 6 cases showed ascaris infection, nly one case had E. histolytica in the stools; patients had malarial parasites in the blood;
and 7 had microfilariae.

Treatment.?A rice-free diet and rest in bed
ment ^ere the two important factors in the treatin this series. Rice in any form was withheld from the patients and a diet rich in pro-

was given throughout the illness and well

ejns the convalescent period. Perfect rest in

jutoed was insisted upon to give the heart as much

rest as possible. Twenty-two patients in this

series were treated only with rest and rice-free

let with quite satisfactory results.

A large number of drugs were tried. Digi-

administered in 31 patients and lately tincture

. ?t ephedra was given by mouth in 28 cases with

a view to controlling cardio-capillary crises.

M ith regard to details of the comparative

Usefulness of these drugs, the reader's attention

^ arawn to the previous paper (Chopra and

Bose, 1933).

The digitalis group of drugs was of little j ue in relieving cardiac symptoms of epidemic ctropsy. Capillary constrictors, such as adrenalin or ephedra, preferably combined with a nerve tonic, such as strychnine and a hsematinic, such as iron, gave the best results. In acute cases with intense venous engorgement bloodettmg was tried to relieve the cardiovascular system. This procedure often helped the patient 0 get over a crisis and thus saved several lives.

Results.?In this series of 131 cases there W^ere 9 deaths; 75 patients were discharged as cured, 35 as relieved, and 14 were discharged Without marked improvement.

Summary cund conclusions Epidemics of .this disease do not recur year a ter year; the disease is at. its worst during >e rains. It generally affects both sexes at ie prime of life, and, so far as our observalons go, only rice-eating races are affected, u this series, although the number of Moham-
Uiedan patients is much less than that of Hindus
and Christians, the proportion of Mohammedans 0 the other two religious groups is the same amongst epidemic dropsy cases as amongst the v iole hospital population. The Mohammedans, lowever, form 55 per cent of the total populaJon of the province, but the bulk of them are
cultivators and field labourers. It would appear hat the disease is pre-eminently one of the uiiddle-class people.
CEdema, diarrhoea and fever are the commonCs symptoms at the onset; the cardiac and

other symptoms are nearly always later com-

plications. As the name of the disease implies, oedema is
almost a constant feature. Fever and bowel

complications are frequent symptoms of the disease, particularly during severe epidemics. The heart is nearly always affected with more or less severity. The knee jerks are variable, but an increase in the jerks is the commonest variation. Neuritic pains and tenderness of the affected limbs are important nervous manifestations; the eye symptoms are variable and in certain epidemics a large number of patients suffered from glaucoma while in others there were less. Flushing of the affected limbs and in certain cases a hemorrhagic rash may be

encountered. Sarcoids are an interesting skin

phenomenon of the disease. The most important factors in treatment are
(1) rice-free diet, and (2) rest in bed. The digitalis group of drugs is of little value in the car-

diac failure of epidemic dropsy. Adrenalin and

pituitrin injections give temporary benefit and are useful in averting cardio-capillary crises. Tincture of ephedra vulgaris introduced by the
senior author combined with calcium lactate has

lately proved efficacious.
