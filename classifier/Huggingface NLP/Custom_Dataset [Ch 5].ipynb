The present study described the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the allergen sensitization rate in patients with allergic diseases in central China. The results provide reliable epidemiological data for the prevention and control of allergic diseases during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: Data were collected from a total of 6,915 patients with symptoms of allergic diseases who visited the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University in China for allergen testing from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021. Patients were divided into a children group (\u003c14 years old), youth group (1544 years old), middle-aged group (4559 years old), and elderly group (\u003e60 years old). Immunoblotting was used to detect 20 serum allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) antibodies in patient serum samples. We compared the positive rates of various allergens in different age and sex groups before and during the COVID-19 epidemic, and the prevalence data of sIgE sensitization were analysed. Results: Among the 6,915 patients\", 'with symptoms of allergic diseases, 2,838 (41.04%) patients were positive for at least one of the allergens. The top three positive rates of inhaled allergens were Dermatophagoides farinae (1,764 cases, 25.51%), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (1,616 cases, 23.37%), and house dust (645 cases, 9.33%). The top three positive rates of food allergens were eggs (686 cases, 9.92%), milk (509 cases, 7.36%), and crabs (192 cases, 2.78%). The total positive rate of allergens was higher in men (46.99%) than in women (37.30%). Compared to 2 years before the COVID-19 epidemic, the rate of sensitization to indoor inhalant allergens increased, but outdoor inhalant allergens showed no significant change. The positive rates of milk and eggs peaked during the outbreak of COVID-19 (2020) then declined in 2021. The total positive rate of allergens was higher in males than females before and during the COVID-19 epidemic, but more allergens were different between males and females during the pandemic. Compared to middle-aged and older adults, the children and youth groups were more susceptible to allergic diseases, and they exhibited an increasing positive rate for most common allergens, especially indoor inhalant allergens, during the COVID-19 epidemic than before the pandemic.

Allergic diseases include eczema, atopic dermatitis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis. Food allergies affect more than 25% of the population in industrialized countries, and the sensitization rate is increasing in developing countries [1, 2]. Complex gene-environment interactions likely trigger allergic diseases and affect the development of allergic diseases [3]. Several factors, including climate change, pollution, reduction in biodiversity, urbanization, and changes in lifestyle and eating habits, contribute to changes in the allergen prevalence pattern [1, 2, 4]. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19), local governments have called on people to adopt various epidemic prevention measures including the wearing of masks, social distancing, strengthening of hand hygiene, and controlling crowd gatherings to stop viral production. People spent more time at home. Outdoor entertainment activities were greatly reduced, and most inperson shopping changed to online shopping. Most schools had delayed openings, classroom courses were changed to online teaching, and remote working became trendy. The changes in people's living habits and the environment may have transformed the type and frequency of allergens that people were exposed to compared to previous years before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on allergic diseases is not certain.\", 'An accurate diagnosis of allergic diseases is essential to prevent and delay disease development [5]. Allergen testing methods include the patch test, skin prick testing, serum-specific IgE (sIgE) testing, and basophil activation testing. Serum allergen sIgE detection exhibits a high safety profile and provides relatively reliable results, which played a significant role in the prevention and control of allergic diseases during the pandemic. Our study analysed the serum allergen sIgE detection results of 6,915 patients with symptoms of allergic diseases who vis-', 'Subjects and Methods', 'Study Population A total of 6,915 serum allergen sIgE antibody detection data were obtained from the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University in Changsha, Hunan Province, from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021. Approximately 90.5% of the patients lived in urban areas, and only 6.3% were from rural areas. Approximately 3.2% of the patients had incomplete address information or could not be contacted. We collected the data of patients with suspected or diagnosed allergic diseases, including eczema, atopic dermatitis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis. The data we collected included the date of blood sample collection, age, sex, and the sIgE test results of 20 allergens. Our data included 1,275, 1,677, 1,599, and 2,364 patients in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, with 2,660 male patients and 4,255 female patients. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1.60. The age ranged from 1 to 97 years old, the average age was 30.65 years old, and the median age was 29 (18, 45) years old. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.', 'The Detection Method Professional staff detected patient serum sIgE using the URANUS AE 85 automatic enzyme immunoassay instrument (Jiangsu Akcome Science \u0026 Technology Co., Ltd., China). Allergens detected by the allergen sIgE antibody detection kit (Jiangsu Haoobo Biomedical Co., Ltd., China) included Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, cat epithelium, dog epithelium, peanuts, soybeans, milk, crab, shrimp, eggs, beef, cod, wheat flour, lamb, house dust, cockroach, Alternaria, willow, ragweed, and mugwort. Sample preparation method: five millilitres of peripheral venous blood drawn from the patient was centrifuged (3,000 r/min for 10 min), and the upper serum was taken. The laboratory staff operated the testing equipment for allergen detection. Experimental principle: the system used the enzyme-linked immunocapture method, which first captures all IgE antibodies in the serum using anti-IgE antibodies encapsulated on a solid-phase carrier. Known standard liquid-phase allergens were added to bind to IgE antibodies. The enzyme-labelled antibody and substrate were added, and the enzyme catalysed the chromogenic reaction of the substrate. The absorbance of the end product was detected to reflect the slgE content of the sample. The grading and interpretation of the results followed the international standard [6]. Grading criteria: grade 0 (0 to \u003c3.50 IU/mL), grade 1 (0.35 to \u003c0.70 IU/ mL), grade 2 (0.70 to \u003c3.50 IU/mL), grade 3 (3.50 to \u003c17.50 IU/ mL), grade 4 (17.50 to \u003c50.00 IU/mL), grade 5 (50.00 to \u003c100.00 IU/mL), and grade 6 (100.00 IU/mL).

Patients with allergic diseases, such as asthma, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 after infection [7]. However, a recent sub-cohort study evaluated long-term COVID-19 symptoms at Stanford. This study showed that asthma was not a risk factor for more severe COVID-19. Non-allergic asthmatic patients had twice the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 compared to allergic asthmatic patients. Lower levels of eosinophils were related to more severe COVID-19 disease [8]. Eosinophil counts are allergic biomarkers. However, most COVID-19 patients had reduced blood eosinophil counts [9]. Therefore, more research is needed to examine whether patients become more or less sensitized to COVID-19 infection.', \"Changes in lifestyle and living environment may alter people's susceptibility and the population distribution of various allergens [10].

Among the 6,915 patients with allergic diseases in this study, the three inhalation allergens with the highest positive rates were D. farinae (25.51%), D. pteronyssinus (23.37%), and house dust (9.33%), and the three food allergens with the highest positive rates were eggs (9.92%), milk (7.36%), and crab (2.78%). D. farinae is the most common inhaled allergen in our city in Central China. The distribution of allergens varies in different regions due to the geographical environment, climatic conditions, and lifestyles. China has a warm and humid subtropical climate, and D. farinae is the most common allergen in most parts of China. D. farinae has strong antigenicity, and live mites, mite corpses, and mite faeces are allergenic. They are found in pillows, mattresses, fabric sofas, carpets, and air conditioning filters. D. farinae is the most common unavoidable allergen. D. farinae grows quickly, has a strong reproductive ability, and is difficult to completely remove [11].', '8', 'Int Arch Allergy Immunol', 'DOI: 10.1159/000526892', 'Liu/Yang/Zeng/Yang/Li/Zong/Tang/ Wang', '\\x0cTable 6.

Food accounts for a large proportion of the allergens in children. Inhaled allergens accounted for a large proportion of young people and elderly individuals. Children are more likely to be allergic to food allergens because the gastrointestinal barrier function and the mucosal immune system are not fully competent. The function of the gastrointestinal tract is more complete in youth and older populations, and inhalation allergens gradually predominate [12]. Previous studies have reported that vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for food allergy in children [13-16]. During the epidemic, the increased rates of food allergen positivity may be related to the reduced outdoor activities of children and their short exposure to sunlight. There was a statistically significant difference in the positive rates of allergens between the sexes. The total positive rate of allergens in men was higher than in women, and men were more susceptible to most allergens than women, which is consistent with the literature [17, 18].', \"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, people's living habits and living environment have dramatically transformed compared to before the pandemic. Our data showed that the sensitization rate of indoor inhaled allergens, including D. farinae, D. pteronyssinus, cat epithelium, dog epithelium, and house dust, increased in the 2 years during COVID-19 compared to the 2 years before the outbreak of COVID-19, which is consistent with the literature [7, 19]. The government tightened controls during the outbreak, and people went out less and isolated themselves as much as possible. Therefore, the exposure time and frequency of indoor allergens increased significantly compared to outdoor allergens. Staying at home for a long time without frequent ventilation and insufficient sunlight may also increase the sensitivity to indoor allergens [7]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the sensitization rate of food allergens, including eggs, milk, and crabs, peaked in 2020. During the epidemic, people paid more attention to diet and strengthening their nutrition. Eggs and milk are the most common and easily available high-protein foods. Patients with mild allergies or suspected patients were likely to reduce hospital visits during the COVID-19 epidemic. As the epidemic was brought under control in 2021, people's lifestyles gradually returned to normal in 2022. The level of food allergens dropped to pre-epidemic levels in 2021. However, the positive rate varied depending on the severity of the epidemic and epidemic prevention measures in different areas. During the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, more allergens showed differences between men\", 'and women than before the outbreak, and the positive rate of men was higher than women. One study of allergic asthma found that boys had higher atopy and allergen sensitization than girls in childhood, but the opposite was true in adulthood. The change may be related to sex hormones and airway diameter [20]. Therefore, the effect of sex on allergen susceptibility must be further explored.', 'In the context of the normalization of epidemic prevention, the incidence of allergic diseases related to indoor allergens is gradually increasing. Reducing exposure to indoor allergens is a key measure for the prevention and control of allergic diseases. The results of a systematic review abroad suggested that the combined use of acaricides, air purification, carpet cleaning, high-efficiency particulate air filtration vacuum cleaners, mattress covers, mould removal, pest control, and pet cleaning reduced indoor allergies to a certain extent. However, the effect of a single intervention was not clear or ineffective, and no combination of specific interventions was more effective [21]. Therefore, a combination of various intervention measures should be used as much as possible in the prevention and treatment of indoor inhaled allergens to improve the intervention effect. Cross-reactivity and/ or co-sensitization of allergens, such as myosin, and arginine kinases in insects were demonstrated in patients with D. pteronyssinus and seafood allergies. Researchers recently found that processing and digestion did not reduce the sensitization of insect pan-allergenic myosin and arginine kinases. Therefore, patients with D. farinae allergies should be cautious in eating foods that may contain cross-allergens, such as shrimp and mealworms [22].', 'The present study has some limitations. It was a retrospective study, and the positive rate varied depending on the severity of the epidemic and epidemic prevention measures in different areas. Therefore, it only represents the allergen changes in one urban area in central China before and after the COVID-19 epidemic. More regional data are needed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on allergic diseases in the future.', 'For normalization of epidemic prevention, the data in the present study showed that the positive rates of indoor inhalant allergens and most common food allergens, including eggs and milk, increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Indoor allergens should be placed first in the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases, and a combination of various indoor cleaning measures should be used to improve the efficiency of interventions. The study provides reliable epidemiological data and guiding advice for the prevention and control of allergic diseases during normalized epidemic prevention.', '10', 'Int Arch Allergy Immunol', 'DOI: 10.1159/000526892', 'Liu/Yang/Zeng/Yang/Li/Zong/Tang/ Wang', '\\x0cStatement of Ethics', 'The need for informed consent was waived by the Ethics Committee of the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University.
