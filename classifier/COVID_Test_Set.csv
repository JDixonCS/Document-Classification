"age at COVID-19 diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.096, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.15) and parity (OR, 1.703, 95% CI, 1.13-2.57) were identified as significant risk factors of severe diseases. Among women who delivered, 78.5% underwent cesarean section. Preterm birth (38.5%), premature rupture of membranes (7.7%), and miscarriage (4.6%) occurred, but there was no stillbirth or neonatal death. The RT-PCR test of newborns' amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood samples was negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Conclusion: At the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, gestational age and parity of pregnant women were the risk factors of disease severity.

INTRODUCTION,0,,False,Test
"The global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) has created a major global health concern. At the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2, the World Health Organization designated pregnant women as a vulnerable group based on preliminary studies, which reported poor obstetric and neonatal outcomes of previous outbreaks of respiratory virus infections, including SARS,1,2 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS),3,4 and influenza.5",1,pandemic,True,Test
"The anatomical, physiological, and immunological changes that occur during normal pregnancy can have systematic effects, which make pregnant women more likely to develop complications from respiratory tract infections.6,7 However, the available data are insufficient and inconsistent to infer the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women in terms of obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Although critical illness was relatively uncommon in both groups, the maternal and obstetric outcomes appeared to be worse in pregnant women, compared with that in non-pregnant women with COVID-19.8,9 Pregnant women will not only develop a more severe form of COVID-19 but also experience pregnancy-related complications such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, and stillbirth.9-16 However, other studies reported that with COVID-19 pregnant women have less severe consequences than those with other coronavirus infections such as SARS or MERS.17 Furthermore, the severity of COVID-19 in pregnant women is similar to that in non-pregnant women.13,14,18-28",1,respiratory,True,Test
"In the Republic of Korea (ROK), a previous nationwide study using claims data suggested that the prevalence of COVID-19 was lower in pregnant women (0.02%) than in nonpregnant women aged 20-44 years (0.14%) from January 2020 to February 2021. The medical insurance systems in the ROK that cover all Korean citizens include the National Health Insurance (97%) and the Medical Aid program (3%), which provide easy access to medical institutions. In the ROK, at the beginning of this pandemic, all pregnant women with COVID-19 were admitted in order to receive intensive and careful management. Data concerning the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women in Korea's differentiated healthcare environment is extremely scarce. This fundamental information is essential to assess the clinical benefits and risks of COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"Recent data from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency showed 1 (3.27%) died and 73 (3.27%) developed severe COVID-19 among the 2,232 pregnant women with COVID-19 from January 2020 to December 2021.30 The fatality rate of pregnant women with COVID-19 was 0.04%, which was not different from that of non-pregnant women of reproductive age (20-45 years), although the incidence rate of critical illness in pregnant women (3.3%) was nine times higher than that in non-pregnant women at reproductive age (0.4%). Even in three other studies conducted in the ROK, pregnant women with COVID-19 were not at higher risk of developing a severe disease,26,27,31 which was similar to the results of previous studies conducted outside of the ROK.13,14,18-25,28",1,Disease,True,Test
"With regard to the use of therapeutic agents in pregnant women, remdesivir and corticosteroids were administered in 14.8% and 23.7%, respectively, and even those with mild diseases were prescribed these medications. The United States Food and Drug Administration assigned remdesivir and corticosteroids to pregnancy risk category B and C, respectively. Patients with severe cases included in our study were more likely to receive remdesivir or corticosteroids than those with mild cases. According to the COVID-19 treatment guidelines developed by the National Institutes of Health, the therapeutic management of pregnant patients with COVID-19 should be the same as that of nonpregnant patients.32 However, the benefit-risk balances in each single case should be considered when selecting a specific drug for the treatment of COVID-19 in pregnant patients.33",1,disease,True,Test
"The preterm birth and cesarean section rates in the present study were relatively high (38.5% and 78.5%, respectively) compared with that (20.6-25.0% and 52.3-95.8%, respectively) in a previous systematic review.16 Preterm birth ( 37 weeks) and cesarean section were more frequent in pregnant women with severe disease than in those with mild diseases. The mode of delivery did not lead to the vertical transmission of COVID-19 or did not affect the neonatal outcomes.34-36 The selection of mode of delivery may have been based on the hospital infection control status and medical condition of pregnant women in addition to the previous history of cesarean delivery, failure of labor to progress, breech presentation, and premature rupture of membranes.34,37-39",1,area,True,Test
"Our study showed no evidence of vertical transmission in pregnant women with COVID-19. In the recent study, 1.8% of newborns of pregnant women with COVID-19 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-qPCR, and 1% experienced antenatal and intrapartum transmission.40 The study suggested that the severity of maternal COVID-19 seemed to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in neonates.40",1,transmission,True,Test
"In this study, the Apgar score was higher in newborns of mothers with severe illness compared with newborns of mothers with mild illness. However, the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores of most newborns were 7 to 10; hence, no further intervention was provided. Only 6 neonates had a 1-minute Apgar score of 5 or 6, and were equally distributed in the mild and severe groups. Furthermore, the incidence of transient tachypnea of newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, and neonatal pneumonia was not different between the two groups, and none of the neonates died. Based on the results of this study, the disease severity of pregnant women with COVID-19 did not affect the neonatal outcomes.",1,respiratory,True,Test

"This study has some limitations. First, although the data were collected from 15 hospitals, only some of the data from the study population were included in the analysis as a small sample size. Therefore, the interpretation of the results is limited, and our findings may have limited generalizability. Second, the severity of pregnant women with COVID-19 was possibly overestimated because the data were collected from a tertiary medical institution. Third, the vaccination status of pregnant women was not investigated in this study. However, COVID-19 vaccination was initiated in the ROK from October 18, 2020. Until December 2021, only 9.8% of pregnant women were vaccinated against COVID-19 in the ROK. Therefore, the maternal outcomes associated with COVID-19 vaccination did not significantly affect the results of this study. Finally, this study was conducted on patients with COVID-19 prior to the outbreak of omicron variant. The subjects included in our study are presumed to be mainly related to the wild type, the alpha variant, and delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Hence, our results were difficult to apply in those infected with omicron variants.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"To the best of our knowledge, this multicenter cohort study was the first to investigate the maternal, obstetric, and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 according to disease severity in the ROK. In conclusion, the present study showed that outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 were similar to those of non-pregnant women, but they were at higher risk of progression to severe disease. In pregnant women with COVID-19, the probability of vertical transmission is extremely rare, but attention should be paid to the obstetrical complications according to severity of the patient's clinical condition. Hence, the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women should be clarified by conducting a nationwide prospective cohort study. These fundamental data will contribute to optimized allocation of scarce resources and formulation of rational healthcare policies to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"Objective: To describe the experience of implementing a deep learning-based computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the interpretation of chest X-ray radiographs (CXR) of suspected coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients and investigate the diagnostic performance of CXR interpretation with CAD assistance. Materials and Methods: In this single-center retrospective study, initial CXR of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were investigated. A commercialized deep learning-based CAD system that can identify various abnormalities on CXR was implemented for the interpretation of CXR in daily practice. The diagnostic performance of radiologists with CAD assistance were evaluated based on two different reference standards: 1) real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) results for COVID-19 and 2) pulmonary abnormality suggesting pneumonia on chest CT. The turnaround times (TATs) of radiology reports for CXR and rRT-PCR results were also evaluated. Results: Among 332 patients (male:female, 173:159; mean age, 57 years) with available rRT-PCR results, 16 patients (4.8%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Using CXR, radiologists with CAD assistance identified rRT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients with sensitivity and specificity of 68.8% and 66.7%, respectively. Among 119 patients (male:female, 75:44; mean age, 69 years) with available chest CTs, radiologists assisted by CAD reported pneumonia on CXR with a sensitivity of 81.5% and a specificity of 72.3%. The TATs of CXR reports were significantly shorter than those of rRT-PCR results (median 51 vs. 507 minutes; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Radiologists with CAD assistance could identify patients with rRT-PCR-positive COVID-19 or pneumonia on CXR with a reasonably acceptable performance. In patients suspected with COVID-19, CXR had much faster TATs than rRT-PCRs. Keywords: Radiography, thoracic; COVID-19; COVID-19 diagnostic testing; Pneumonia; Deep learning",1,coronavirus,True,Test

"findings of pneumonia in patients with initially negative rRT-PCR results (4-6) and can be considered as a screening tool for COVID-19 in epidemic areas. However, screening or early diagnosis using chest CT in patients suspected for COVID-19 may not be practical, owing to the risk of viral transmission during the examination, transportation of the patient, and difficulty with disinfecting the environment. Owing to this, chest CT is currently not recommended for screening or initial diagnosis of COVID-19 (7, 8).",1,negative,True,Test
"Chest X-ray radiograph (CXR) is the primary imaging technique in the diagnosis of pneumonia because of its easy accessibility, low cost, low radiation exposure, and reasonable diagnostic capability (9, 10). Therefore, CXR using a portable radiography unit may be considered as a primary radiologic examination for COVID-19 because patient transportation can be minimized and disinfection is relatively easy (7). However, because of the intrinsic limitation of the two-dimensional projection image, where various anatomic or pathologic structures are overlapped, CXR have lower sensitivity compared to chest CTs (11, 12) and are prone to reading errors and inter- or intra-reader variability (13). Thus, a computer-aided detection (CAD) system that can accurately identify pulmonary opacities suggestive of pneumonia may help promptly and accurately diagnose pneumonia, such as that observed in COVID-19 patients (14). In this regard, we implemented a deep learning-based CAD system for the interpretation of CXR of patients who were suspected for COVID-19.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

The CAD system integrated in the protocol was a commercialized deep-learning algorithm (Lunit INSIGHT CXR 2, Lunit Inc.) that was approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety of Korea (15) that detects several thoracic abnormalities, including pulmonary nodules, consolidation, and pneumothorax. The CAD system was originally trained with 54221 normal CXR and 35613 abnormal CXR with four major thoracic diseases including pulmonary malignancy, pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and pneumothorax (15). The CAD system provided a probability score between 0% and 100% for the presence of any of the target abnormalities on each CXR and provided localization of abnormalities when the probability score was 15% or greater, with contour lines overlaid on CXR images (Figs. 1-3).

"patients may appear normal (19-21). Furthermore, reported imaging findings of COVID-19 were bilateral ground-glass opacities with or without consolidations, which are nonspecific in diagnosing COVID-19 (19-23). Not surprisingly, both formal radiology reports (sensitivity, 68.8%; specificity, 66.7%) and CAD results (sensitivity, 43.8%; specificity, 59.8%) showed limited diagnostic performance for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the present study. The sensitivity of formal radiology reports in our study was similar to that of baseline CXR reported in a previous study by Wong et al. (21) (69%). Although there was no statistically significant difference, the standalone CAD results exhibited a substantially lower sensitivity compared to the formal radiology reports (68.8% vs. 43.8%), suggesting limited potential for diagnosis of COVID-19 on CXR with the CAD system only.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"patients may still have clinical implications. Previous studies reported the value of chest CT-based diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients with initial false-negative rRT-PCR results (4-6). In addition, Zhao et al. (24) reported that the extent of abnormalities on chest CT was greater in severe diseases. Furthermore, previous investigations on severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak between 2002 and 2004 have reported that the extent of pulmonary opacity on CXR was a prognostic factor for the adverse patient outcome (25-27). However, obtaining chest CT for all patients suspected for COVID-19 can be very challenging in practice due to the limited availability of CT scanners dedicated to COVID-19 patients, as well as the contagion risk of the virus. Therefore, CXR can be used as the main radiologic examination for patients suspected for COVID-19 and may assist with patient management and prognosis prediction.",1,clinical,True,Test
"With regards to the identification of pulmonary abnormalities suggesting pneumonia based on chest CT, both the formal radiology reports and CAD results exhibited sensitivities of 81.5%. According to a previous multi-center cohort study by Self et al. (12) comprising 3423 patients in the emergency department, the sensitivity of CXR for pulmonary opacity, with chest CT as a reference standard, was 43.5%. Hence, we considered that the sensitivity of the CAD system would be acceptable for implementation in clinical practice to detect pneumonia. Although we were unable to determine the baseline performance of radiologists without use of the CAD system, it may enhance sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary abnormalities. In a previous study using the same CAD system, the sensitivity of radiology residents for identification of abnormal CXR were significantly enhanced (65.6-73.4%) after review of the CAD results (28).",1,clinical,True,Test
"Although the CAD system utilized in our study was only designed to detect a limited number of abnormalities, including pulmonary nodules, masses, consolidations, and pneumothorax, the CAD could actually identify other types of lung parenchymal abnormalities, such as ground-glass opacities, the representative imaging finding of COVID-19 (Fig. 1), since it was initially trained to identify various thoracic diseases including pneumonia (15). Because parenchymal abnormalities related to pneumonia, such as consolidation, ground-glass opacities, reticular opacities often look similar and are indistinguishable on CXR, the CAD system was trained to identify abnormalities related to pneumonia, and was not confined to consolidations.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"However, the non-specific identification of several abnormalities also resulted in false positives, which led to diminished specificity (59.8% for rRT-PCR-positive COVID-19; 58.7% for CT abnormality suggesting pneumonia) of the CAD (Table 3). However, these false positives could be significantly reduced in the formal reports, since CAD was only used as an assistant tool for radiologists, who were able to discard these false positives upon their interpretation of CXR.",1,positive,True,Test
"In addition to morphologic types of abnormality on CXR, the visibility of abnormalities on CXR may be important for the detectability of the lesions. In our study, both the CAD system and formal radiology reports exhibited significantly higher sensitivities for visible abnormalities than invisible abnormalities.

"In our study, the formal radiology reports for CXR exhibited satisfactory TATs (median, 51 minutes), that were significantly shorter than those of the rRT-PCR results (median, 507 minutes). Therefore, we believe that CXR may help screening and triage of patients with high suspicion of COVID-19 pneumonia, especially during an outbreak where there are limited resources for hospitalization and intensive care (21, 29). Considering that our study was performed in a tertiary-referral hospital where radiologists were readily available to interpret CXR, report TATs might be much longer in primary healthcare or community-level practice where immediate availability of radiologists may be limited. Although further studies are required, we believe the CAD system may assist with timely clinical decision making in those situations. In this situation, patients with positive radiographs could be subject to enhanced isolation, which would minimize the transmission of COVID-19 while waiting for rRT-PCR results.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"comparison of performance between the radiologists and the CAD system was not possible, and we could not evaluate whether the CAD system improved the performance of radiologists. To evaluate the effect of the CAD system on the performance of radiologists in a suspected COVID-19 population, further investigation, including the interpretation before and after use of the CAD system, is warranted. Second, our study was performed in a single tertiary institution with a limited number of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, it is difficult to generalize our results, considering that the situation for evaluating patients suspected for COVID-19 may differ significantly across institutions or countries. Third, the CAD system utilized in our study was not trained for all radiographic abnormalities, nor was it trained specifically for COVID-19.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"In summary, we implemented a deep learning-based CAD system for the interpretation of CXR of patients suspected for COVID-19. The formal radiology reports with the assistance of CAD exhibited reasonably acceptable performances for identification of rRT-PCR-positive COVID-19 patients (sensitivity, 68.8%) and CT abnormalities suggesting pneumonia (sensitivity, 81.5%). Moreover, the CAD system resulted in faster TATs than rRT-PCR results. In situations where there are limited medical resources, such as during an outbreak, CXR interpretation with the assistance of CAD may assist clinical decision making and management of patients suspected for COVID-19.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

ABSTRACT,0,,False,Test
"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been deployed broadly as an early warning tool for emerging COVID-19 outbreaks. WBE can inform targeted interventions and identify communities with high transmission, enabling quick and effective responses. As the wastewater (WW) becomes an increasingly important indicator for COVID-19 transmission, more robust methods and metrics are needed to guide public health decision-making. This research aimed to develop and implement a mathematical framework to infer incident cases of COVID-19 from SARS-CoV-2 levels measured in WW. We propose a classification scheme to assess the adequacy of model training periods based on clinical testing rates and assess the sensitivity of model predictions to training periods. A testing period is classified as adequate when the rate of change in testing is greater than the rate of change in cases. We present a Bayesian deconvolution and linear regression model to estimate COVID-19 cases from WW data. The effective reproductive number is estimated from reconstructed cases using WW. The proposed modeling framework was applied to three Northern California communities served by distinct WW treatment plants. The results showed that training periods with adequate testing are essential to provide accurate projections of COVID-19 incidence.",1,epidemiology,True,Test

"Organization (WHO) recommended implementing mass testing programs as a containment measure. Individual diagnostic testing informs contact tracing and medical interventions, ideally cutting chains of transmission short and containing outbreaks. Mass clinical screening programs can also provide valuable data on community-level health trends, but maintaining mass testing programs for the purpose of community-level monitoring is expensive and requires robust infrastructure with consistent availability of testing supplies and human resources (Vandenberg et al., 2021). Moreover, diagnostic tests validated in low-throughput clinical settings (like nucleic acid amplification tests or NAATs) are not necessarily efficient platforms for constructing community screening programs (Raffle et al., 2020). Design-wise, employing such tests for large-scale screening requires extensive logistical coordination over large geographic areas. This becomes especially complicated when the options for diagnostic tests are myriad, lack standardization, and depend heavily on local social landscapes. Small biases in the tests may be inflated when deployed broadly, leading to large spurious associations at the population level (Mardian et al., 2021; Mercer and Salit, 2021).",1,containment,True,Test
"Public health authorities are turning to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as an alternative strategy for less-biased population-level surveillance of COVID-19. WBE uses biomarkers in wastewater (WW) to monitor trends in community-level health indices. WBE methods have been used to detect changes in drug consumption (Castiglioni et al., 2014; Zuccato et al., 2005), dietary patterns (Choi et al., 2019), and the circulation of pathogens like poliovirus and norovirus (Asghar et al., 2014). Measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in WW correlate strongly with changes in COVID-19 prevalence in the associated communities (Huisman et al., 2022; McMahan et al., 2021; Vallejo et al., 2022; Wolfe et al., 2021). Since the onset of the pandemic, WBE of SARS-CoV-2 has been implemented in over 67 countries and 279 universities (COVIDPoops19, 2021). In some places, WBE programs have detected changes in SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in WW prior to changes in local COVID-19 hospitalization activity and spikes in NAAT screening cases (Kirby et al., 2022; Mallapaty et al., 2020; Medema et al., 2020b; Peccia et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2022; Wurtzer et al., 2020). Others have used WBE to assess the effectiveness of public health interventions (Pillay et al., 2021), and recently, WBE was used to predict hospitalizations and ICU admissions (Galani et al., 2022). In addition to monitoring trends, WBE can provide estimates of critical disease transmission parameters in the community without the biases associated with test-seeking behavior or poor access to testing programs.",1,epidemiology,True,Test
"An ongoing challenge for WBE is developing robust data collection and interpretation methods that are comparable across time and geography. Variations in sampling design and sample processing methods, natural variability in viral shedding rates in feces, variability in WW flow volume, population fluctuations, and location-specific characteristics of WW management are all factors that make inference of new COVID-19 cases from WW data challenging (Ahmed et al., 2020; Hill et al., 2020; Medema et al., 2020a; Zhu et al., 2021). Such factors will ultimately affect uncertainty estimates when modeling disease incidence and other public health indicators. An ideal WBE program would implement a generalized approach that provides consistent estimates of disease burden in a targeted population, yielding public health metrics like the disease incidence, disease prevalence and/or the effective reproductive number (Re). Previous studies that approach this problem include: simple algebraic adjustments with environmental constants (Monteiro et al., 2022); estimating the total number of cases with a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model informed by WW results (McMahan et al., 2021); using regression analysis to estimate the number of infected people (Vallejo et al., 2022); and making near real-time estimates of Re (Huisman et al., 2022; Schoen et al., 2022).",1,flu,True,Test
"We propose and compare two modeling approaches: a simple linear model and a Bayesian deconvolution approach to estimate COVID-19 incident cases from WW viral loads. Both models rely on short training periods to calibrate WW measurements using clinical testing data from a community screening program. We evaluate the impact of different training periods on model predictions, hypothesizing that relative rates of change in clinical testing and reported cases can be used to identify appropriate",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"Staff from three Northern California WW treatment facilities (Davis, Woodland, and UC Davis) provided 24-hour composite WW samples 5-7 days per week. Samples were acquired using Teledyne ISCO 5800 refrigerated autosamplers in Davis and Woodland and a Hach Sigma 900 autosampler for UC Davis. The autosampler in Davis was programmed to collect 400 mL of influent every 15 ""pulses"", where one pulse was set at 10,000 gal. An average of 24 pulses was expected per day based on an average daily influent flow of 3.6 million gallons per day (MGD). The autosampler in Woodland was programmed to acquire 100 mL of influent every 15 min over a 24-hour period. The autosampler for UC Davis was programmed to acquire approximately 200 mL of influent every 20 min over a 24-hour period. The reported sample collection date corresponded to the date when an autosampler program was completed. Davis and UC Davis provided 12 mL samples in new 15-mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes. Woodland provided 1 L samples in Nalgene bottles that were washed, sterilized, and reused over the duration of sampling. Samples were stored at 4 °C and transported weekly in coolers on ice to the analytical lab at UC Davis. For biosafety compliance, samples were placed in a water bath set at 60 °C for 30 min and returned to 4 °C prior to sample processing.

"The sample concentration and extraction protocol were adapted from Karthikeyan et al. (2021) using 4.875 mL instead of 10 mL starting sample volume. Each WW sample was deposited into a separate well of a KingFisher 24 deep-well plate (Thermo Fisher). An extraction control blank (nucleasefree water) was included in 90 % of the deep-well plates to assess potential contamination during concentration and extraction. Each well was spiked with 50 L of Nanotrap® Enhancement Reagent 1 (Ceres Nanosciences product ER1 SKU # 10111-10, 10111-30) and 5 L of a stock of vaccine-strain Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV, Bovilis® Coronavirus vaccine) containing an estimated 1.3 × 108 gc/mL as measured by ddPCR. 500 L aliquots of the initial BCoV vaccine stock, prepared from the suspension of lyophilized BCoV vaccine in 20 mL buffer provided with the kit, were stored at -80 ° C prior to use. Each spiked sample was manually agitated by pipetting up and down at least three times using a 5 mL pipette. Samples were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Following incubation, concentration was carried out using 75 L Nanotrap® Magnetic Virus Particles (Ceres Nanosciences) on a KingFisher Apex robot (Thermo Scientific). Concentrated viruses were eluted from the Nanotrap® beads into 400 mL of lysis buffer per sample from the MagMAX Microbiome Ultra Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher). Concentrated samples were extracted per the MagMAX kit manufacturer instructions in 96 deep-well plates on the KingFisher Apex. Samples were eluted in 100 L of MagMAX Elution Solution.

N1/N2 and BCoV/PMMoV were quantified in separate duplex assays. Due to high levels of PMMoV, the sample for the PMMoV/BCoV duplex was diluted 40× prior to loading. The duplex ddPCR amplifications were performed in 20 L reactions on a QX ONE ddPCR System (Bio-Rad). Each reaction contained the following components: 1× Supermix, 20 U/L Reverse transcriptase, 15 mM Dithiothreitol from the One-Step RT-ddPCR Advanced Kit for Probe (Bio-Rad), 900 nM of each primer, 250 nM of each probe, and 5 L of sample extract or control. The one-step ddPCR reaction consisted of 3 min plate equilibrium at 25 ° C, 60 min reverse transcription at 50 ° C, 10 min enzyme activation at 95 ° C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94 ° C and 1 min annealing/extension at 58 ° C, and then 10 min enzyme deactivation at 98 ° C and 1 min droplet stabilization at 25 ° C. Preparation and plating of ddPCR master mix were carried out in a separate location from sample loading to avoid contamination. Sample loading was performed using an epMotionR 5075 (Eppendorf) liquid handler. Each ddPCR plate included duplicate positive controls (stock mixture of synthesized gene fragments containing for the four target regions) for each target and duplicated no-template controls (nuclease free water). Additional information on the ddPCR assay designs is available in Appendix A. Table A.1 summarizes primers, probes for ddPCR assays performed as part of this work. Tables A.2 and A.3 provide the ddPCR reaction and 20× primer/probe mix recipes. From October 21 to December 21, Cy5 and Cy5.5 were used in place of FAM and HEX as the fluorophores for PMMoV and BCoV, respectively. Table A.4 lists details for the positive controls. Prior to 12/21/22 the annealing temperature was 60 ° C. The selection of positive and negative droplet clusters in samples and controls was conducted manually based on visual inspection of clusters. Results were considered invalid if the distribution of positive or negative droplets appeared abnormal in shape or if the total number of droplets generated fell below a threshold of 10,000 droplets in a single well.",1,droplet,True,Test

"The sensitivity of the analytical assay was assessed by determining a limit of detection (LOD) and a limit of blank (LOB) following protocols recommended by the ddPCR manufacturer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 2021, A practical guide for evaluating detection capability using ddPCR). Fifteen WW samples that were initially screened as negative for SARS-CoV-2 in routine WW ddPCR monitoring (i.e., extracts had less than 4 positive droplets in merged wells from duplicate analysis) were used to determine the lowest detectable concentrations in ostensibly blank WW samples. Selection of these extracts provided a conservative approach to determining the LOB. The selected extracts were re-analyzed by ddPCR to obtain data for four additional replicates for each sample. A non-parametric (rank order) method was then used to select the LOB, since results from the blank",1,negative,True,Test

"were not normally distributed. The ddPCR number of droplets from individual wells was tabulated from lowest to highest. The LOB was set at the value of the concentration measurement for the rank position corresponding to the 95th percentile, calculated as follows: Rank ,"" 0.5 + 0.95 (number of measurements). Since the calculated rank position was a non-integer value, the rank position was rounded up to provide a more conservative LOB. The theoretical LOD was set as the LOB plus two times the standard deviation of all replicate results (Biorad, 2021). The LOD and LOB are reported in Table A.5. In terms of droplet numbers in the blank samples, the highest numbers of positive droplets in the merged wells (four replicates) amongst the fifteen blank samples were 6 (N1) and 8 (N2). Since routine WW samples were analyzed in duplicate, 3 (N1) and 4 (N2) droplets were set as the cutoff to mark samples below the droplet threshold. Samples were also considered below the droplet threshold if there were fewer N1 and N2 droplets than twice the number of droplets in the extraction control blank analyzed on the same day.

The average SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in the initial WW sample was calculated from the average of the N1 and N2 results, corrected for sample and reagent volumes used, and reported as genome copies (gc) per mL WW. BCoV was detected in 100 % of spiked samples, and concentrations of targets were not corrected for BCoV recovery efficiency. If N1 or N2 merged droplet counts were below the minimum droplet threshold, the target was excluded from the average concentration. If both N1 and N2 targets were below the droplet threshold, the concentration was reported as 0.

Statistically representative samples can also be difficult to obtain because of the complexity of WW collection systems and the physical challenge of ensuring consistency in sample acquisition and processing (Panchal et al., 2021). Such challenges can limit the comparability of WW results across different WBE programs. The modeling framework we described to estimate COVID-19 cases from WW data accounts for uncertainty and relies on short training periods using clinical testing data to calibrate WW measurements to local conditions.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"We showed that case projections reconstructed from either the Bayesian deconvolution or the simple linear model were generally higher than cases observed through clinical testing, particularly during periods with sub-optimal testing.

While both the deconvolution and linear regression models captured the trends in observed cases overall, qualitative differences were evident between the approaches, particularly when testing was limited. Both models identified steep upward trends in cases during the surge in mid-January and at the onset of the Omicron surge Fig. 4A.",1,case,True,Test
"The classification approach we developed to assess the adequacy of model training periods was essential to providing robust estimates of case projections. Training periods that satisfied the proposed characteristics (i.e., adequate testing) resulted in similar estimates from each model and yielded trends consistent with observed cases. Case projections that assumed training periods with poor testing generally underestimated cases compared to projections from adequate training periods. While the proposed models do not seek to recover the curve of reported cases (an underestimate of actual cases, especially in a limited testing scenario), the use of adequate training periods for the WW models enabled us to capture trends in case counts much more closely. It is evident that training periods with inadequate testing introduce a downward bias into the model.",1,case,True,Test
"WBE has substantially lower resource requirements than mass diagnostic testing, and WW data lack bias from care- and test-seeking behavior in the catchment population. WBE programs that determine COVID19 public health metrics at the community level can work as a powerful and cost-effective complement to other, more traditional intervention methods. The analytic methods presented here can inform local public health policy and community-level interventions, for instance, by helping to assess when the initiation of clinical screening programs and nonpharmaceutical interventions are needed. The model can be especially valuable to fill data gaps during surges of infection when clinical testing is inadequate and could be used to assess when estimates of case rates exceed certain thresholds. WBE does come with the inherent challenge of determining the populations being monitored, which is exacerbated if the population served is highly mobile (e.g., a university campus). In other words, WBE methods for tracking COVID-19 are inherently location-specific, whereas public screening programs are tied to the people they serve.

"WBE surveillance systems should be cognizant that they are not unduly targeting and stigmatizing vulnerable communities.

Yet focusing too heavily on public surveillance efforts can negatively influence public perception of those being monitored (Sims and Kasprzyk-Hordern, 2020).

Our modeling framework may also lack accuracy in long-term predictions when the relationship between wastewater and cases changes over time, as it is observed with the emergence of new variants (Frampton et al., 2021; Graham et al., 2021).

"· While the magnitude of predicted cases depended on training periods, similar case trends were observed. This, in turn, was reflected in similar estimates of Re, suggesting that the models are able to track infection dynamics even with inadequate training periods.",1,case,True,Test

"Abstract The emergence of the monkeypox outbreak in early 2022 has posed a new global health threat. As of July 8, 2022, 9069 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, and most of them are from non-endemic countries. The monkeypox virus is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus, and preliminary genetic data suggest that the 2022 monkeypox virus belongs to the West African clade. In the current outbreak, human-to-human transmission has been the primary transmission mode. Although direct skin-to-skin contact with lesions during sexual activities can spread the virus, it remains unclear whether monkeypox can spread through sexual contact, specifically through contaminated body fluids. The typical presentation of monkeypox includes prodromal symptoms, followed by a rash that usually begins within 1e3 days of symptom onset, and the skin lesions can last for 2e4 weeks and then gradually resolve. However, the monkeypox outbreak in 2022 may exhibit atypical features. A definite diagnosis of monkeypox virus infection requires nucleic acid amplification testing via the polymerase chain reaction method. Supportive care is essential, and antiviral therapy is not",1,outbreak,True,Test

"As of 18 July, 2022, more than 559 million cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported since the first outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in China. This outbreak has caused more than 6 million deaths globally.1,2 However, the impact of COVID-19 has been mitigated via the development of effective vaccines, antiviral agents, and other treatments.3e9 The emergence of the monkeypox outbreak in 2022 has posed another global health threat.10 Between January 1 and June 22, 2022, a total of 3413 laboratoryconfirmed cases and 1 death have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 50 countries or territories in five WHO Regions.11 As of July 8, the cumulative confirmed case numbers increased to 9069.12 Because the rapid increase of monkeypox cases, WHO declared the escalating global monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on Juy 23, 2022.",1,case,True,Test
"Monkeypox was first identified in colonies of monkeys in 1958. It was later detected in a 9-month child in a remote village in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970.13 Before the current outbreak, monkeypox was typically found in central and west Africa, where rodents live in tropical rainforests and may carry the virus. Occasionally, monkeypox was found in countries outside central and west Africa, owing to travel from regions where monkeypox is endemic. Notably, monkeypox in non-endemic areas not linked to travel from endemic countries is atypical, and these atypical cases have become increasingly prevalent.",1,outbreak,True,Test
"Monkeypox is not typically highly contagious because it requires close physical contact with someone carrying the virus. Although the risk to the general public was considered low previously, the WHO is responding to this outbreak as a high priority to avoid further spread.11 In the 2022 outbreak, the reported cases did not have apparent links to travel history from endemic countries, or contact history with infected animals. Therefore, as the current outbreak is atypical and different from previous cases, a comprehensive understanding of monkeypox, including causative pathogen, possible transmission modalities, current epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, treatment, and prevention, is urgently needed.

"The monkeypox virus is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus that comprises two genetic clades: Central African (Congo Basin) clade and West African clade. These two clades are divided geographically by Cameroon, the only country with both virus clades. The West African clade has been found in outbreaks in Nigeria, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, and the USA (imported from Ghana). The Central African clade has been found in Gabon, Cameroon, the Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.15e18 In addition to geographical differences, these two clades significantly differ in epidemiologic and clinical characteristics. The Central African clade, endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where more than 2000 suspected cases are reported yearly, is more prevalent than the West African clade.19 Compared with the West African clade, the Central African strain could be associated with more severe disease and higher transmissibility. The West African clade is associated with a low case fatality rate (CFR) of <1%, and no human-to-human transmission has ever been documented. In contrast, the CFR of the Congo Basin clade could be up to 11%, and documented human-to-human transmissions up to six sequential events have been reported.15 Similarly, a systematic review found a significant difference in CFR between the Central African clade (10.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.4%e13.3%) and West African clade (3.6%; 95% CI: 1.7%e6.8%).20",1,outbreak,True,Test

"Many animal species are susceptible to the monkeypox virus, including rope squirrels, tree squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice, and non-human primates. Although rodents are considered a potential natural reservoir of the monkeypox virus, the most important natural reservoir remains to be identified. The animal-to-human transmission of the monkeypox virus can occur through direct contact with an infected animal's blood, body fluid, skin, or mucosal lesions. In addition, consuming inappropriately cooked meat or products of infected animals could be another possible transmission route. Close physical contact is the main route of human-to-human transmission, which may require prolonged close contact. Transmission may occur through contact with skin lesions of infected patients, contaminated objects, and respiratory droplets. Rarely, congenital monkeypox results from viral transmission through the placenta. Because there are strict protocols for screening blood donations, there have been no reports of monkeypox spreading through blood transfusions. In the current outbreak, monkeypox rashes are commonly found in the genital area and likely contribute to transmission during sexual contact. In addition, monkeypox rashes can resemble those of sexually transmitted diseases, including herpes and syphilis. This may explain why several cases in the current outbreak have been identified among men seeking care in sexual health clinics.22,28e30 Although direct skin-to-skin contact during sexual activities can spread the virus, it remains unclear whether the monkeypox virus can spread through sexual contact, specifically through semen or vaginal fluids.",1,transmission,True,Test

"The rise in the number of monkeypox cases during the COVID-19 pandemic makes the situation more complicated.

In addition, co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses is not uncommon.41 Therefore, the potential for co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and the monkeypox virus cannot be neglected. However, the changes related to infectivity patterns, severity, management, or response to vaccination in one or both diseases are unknown.

Moreover, a recent analysis of 124 cases identified several preliminary risk factors, including being a young man, having sex with other men, engaging in risky behaviors and activities such as condomless sex, and HIV positivity.46 Finally, healthcare workers could have a higher risk owing to a longer duration of virus exposure.47",1,outbreak,True,Test
Clinical manifestations,1,Clinical,True,Test
"The mean incubation period of monkeypox was 8.5 (95% CI: 4.2e17.3) days.48 Prodromal symptoms of monkeypox include fever, chills, sore throat, cough, headache, myalgia, blepharoconjunctivitis, lethargy, and adenopathy, followed by rashes that usually begin within 1e3 days of symptom onset. The rash typically appears on the face and then becomes generalized with the involvement of the palms and soles. Rashes can also be found in the mouth, genitals, and eyes. These lesions can be flat or slightly raised; filled with clear or yellowish fluid; and then crust, dry, and fall off. The number of skin lesions can range from a few to several thousands. The evolution of rashes is similar to that of smallpox, from macules, to papules, vesicles, pustules and scabs evolving over 2e4 weeks. Skin lesions typically last 2e4 weeks and gradually resolve without treatment. These dermatological characteristics of monkeypox with lymphadenopathy are different from those of chickenpox and smallpox and help clinicians make a differential diagnosis (Table 1). However, the current monkeypox outbreak in 2022 can have atypical features, including (a) only a few or even single lesions or the absence of skin lesions in some cases; (b) lesions mostly located in genital and perianal sites and presenting with anal pain and bleeding; (C) skin lesions restricted to genital, perineal or perianal areas; (D) asynchronous lesions, ranging from single or clustered spots to umbilicated papules with progressive central ulceration, and, finally, to scabs; (E) absence of prodromal symptoms, such as fever, malaise, and headache before the development of a rash; (F) presence of herald skin lesions at the point of sexual contact in some patients (Table 2).11,22,29,46,49",1,incubation,True,Test

A systematic review conducted before the current outbreak reported that the overall CFR was approximately 8.7% but CFR was different in different areas, ranging from 0 to 11%.

"Monkeypox can spread to people when they come into physical contact with infected animals. The animal hosts include rodents and primates. The risk of zoonotic transmission can be reduced by avoiding unprotected contact with wild animals, especially those sick or dead (including their meat and blood). In endemic countries, where animals may carry monkeypox, food containing animal meat or parts should be cooked thoroughly before eating.",1,spread,True,Test
"Individuals with monkeypox are infectious and have symptoms. Rashes, bodily fluids (such as fluid, pus, or blood from skin lesions), and scabs are particularly infectious. Clothing, bedding, towels, or objects such as eating utensils/dishes that have been contaminated with the virus from an infected person can also infect others. Ulcers, lesions, and sores in the mouth can also be infectious, meaning that the virus can spread through saliva and respiratory droplets. Because close physical contact is the primary route for human-to-human transmission, limiting contact with people who have suspected or confirmed monkeypox is the key to prevention. People with multiple sexual partners, including those living with HIV-infected patients, are encouraged to reduce their risk of exposure to monkeypox by avoiding close contact with anyone with symptoms. Reducing the number of sexual partners also reduces the risk of infection.",1,infectious,True,Test
"Healthcare workers who take care of patients with monkeypox should encourage them to self-isolate and cover any skin lesions. A medical mask is essential when physically close to the patient, especially if the patient is coughing or has lesions in the mouth. Avoid skin-to-skin contact whenever possible, and use disposable gloves while directly contacting skin lesions. Hand hygiene with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub is needed, especially after contact with infected people and their clothes, bed sheets, towels, and other items or surfaces they have touched or that might have come into contact with their rash or respiratory secretions. No¨rz et al. examined surfaces in rooms occupied by two monkeypox patients on their fourth hospitalization day.

"People vaccinated against smallpox in the past may have some protection against monkeypox and its associated manifestations.57,58 However, original smallpox vaccines are no longer available, and people aged <40e50 years are unlikely to have been vaccinated. The US FDA approved JYNNEOSTM (also known as IMVAMUNE, IMVANEX, MVA-BN) in 2019 to prevent monkeypox in adults aged 18 years at high risk for smallpox or monkeypox.59 In addition, this vaccine has been approved in Europe for smallpox, although the UK has used it off-label in response to monkeypox cases. ACAM2000â, another smallpox vaccine, was licensed by the FDA in August 2007 and has been indicated for active immunization against smallpox disease for persons determined to be at high risk for smallpox infection. Because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has the emergency access to investigational new drugs, it allows the use of ACAM2000â for non-variola Orthopoxvirus infections, such as monkeypox, during an outbreak.60",1,vaccine,True,Test
"Given the experience of combating COVID-19, all healthcare authorities are well versed in effectively mitigating an infectious disease.5,61e64 Many infection control and prevention measures have been adopted to contain the current monkeypox outbreak. These policies include early identification of cases, contact tracing, travel and gathering restrictions according to the risk of infection, establishment of an adequate quarantine window, appropriate personal protective equipment provision for healthcare workers, avoidance of stigmatizing messaging circulating online related to monkeypox, and development of effective vaccines and postexposure prophylaxis.65,66",1,COVID-19,True,Test

ABSTRACT,0,,False,Test
"The wildlife trade is a major cause of species loss and can trigger disease transmission. While the COVID-19 pandemic sparked public interest in eliminating the wildlife trade, a better under­ standing is needed of the economic repercussions of COVID-19 on those who rely on wildlife farming for their livelihoods. Using the case studies of Ba Ria Vung Tau and Binh Duong provinces in Vietnam - a country seen as Asia's wildlife trade hotspot - this paper explores COVID-19's impacts on wildlife farms and their owners. Understanding these impacts is important, both in order to design appropriate interventions to support local people in mitigating COVID-19's im­ pacts as well as to inform effective policymaking around wildlife conservation in Vietnam. In this study, we adopted mixed research methods (including a literature and policy review, stakeholder consultation with government agencies and NGOs engaged in designing and monitoring wildlife conservation policies, a wildlife farming household survey, and research validation workshop) to understand the status of Vietnamese wildlife farms, as well as the impacts of COVID-19, and any opportunities and challenges for wildlife conservation and management in Vietnam. Our paper shows that, across the two studied provinces, numbers of wildlife farms and farmed wildlife animals have both declined since the pandemic, with declining market demand and wildlife farm owners experiencing difficulties accessing markets due to travel restrictions. Although this affected wildlife-related income, this represented less than 30 % of families' overall income on average, and thus households were able to maintain their livelihoods through other sources. Most wildlife is raised as an additional food source for farming families and plays an important role in the diets of surveyed households. Findings also highlighted that most surveyed households' postpandemic recovery strategies involved expanding their wildlife farms in scope and scale; these households perceived a stable domestic market and high prices for wildlife products in future.",1,disease,True,Test

"Our study found several opportunities for sustainable wildlife farming practices, including greater political commitment, an increasing number of wildlife conservation policies, and stronger law enforcement mechanisms. Challenges remain, however; including an unclear and inconsistent policy framework, the presence of an illegal market, and wildlife farm owners' limited knowledge and understanding of wildlife policies. Our paper also shows a lack of comprehensive data and understanding around actual wildlife transactions during the pandemic, leading to challenges in confirming whether COVID-19 had any real impact on wildlife trade. Further research is required to address this knowledge gap.",1,pandemic,True,Test
1. Introduction,0,,False,Test
"The wildlife trade is a major cause of species loss and is one of the main causes of disease transmission (Liew et al., 2021; Wik­ ramanayake et al., 2021). COVID-19 has thus been seen as an alarm call, raising public and policymakers' awareness and commitment to addressing this challenge (Lin, 2021). Previous studies have found COVID-19 to have multiple and multifaceted impacts on wildlife trading and farming, both positive and negative. The pandemic has led to a decline in financial and human resources devoted to wildlife conservation in many places, posing a significant threat to animal welfare, and challenging government agencies and con­ servation communities alike in the post-pandemic period (Neupane, 2020; Baptista et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2021).",1,disease,True,Test
"The COVID-19 outbreak also intensified an unsettled debate on whether governments should legalize or criminalize the commercial trade of wildlife (D'cruze et al., 2020; Bennett et al., 2021; Borz´ee et al., 2021). Banning wildlife trade, as China has done, can translate political will to address illegal wildlife farming and trade by strengthening existing monitoring and law enforcement mechanisms and enhancing legislation and regulation around wildlife farming practices, thereby galvanizing rapid, widespread knock-on actions and impacts (Koh et al., 2021). This is necessary to promote improvements in wildlife management, for example updating protected species lists, revising laws, strengthening existing but poorly implemented wildlife policies, and changing consumption behaviors (Yang et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2021).",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"However, while conservation communities advocate for banning the wildlife trade (Lindsey et al., 2020; Roe et al., 2020), several scholars propose that policymakers and conservationists could take a policy-based approach instead, considering species-specific attributes of biological productivity as well as the management context (Shi et al., 2020; Bennett et al., 2021). This is because a ban might not fully acknowledge and address key drivers of emerging infectious diseases, such as: habitat destruction, which largely driven by agricultural expansion and industrial livestock production (Roe et al., 2020); wildlife consumption and animal-based food systems (Shi and Hu, 2008; Murray et al., 2016); international wildlife trade and crime (Bell et al., 2004); and larger trends of deforestation, defaunation, and environmental exploitation (Gatti, 2020, IPBES, 2020, van Uhm and Zaitch 2021). As COVID-19 has negatively affected local livelihoods (Rahman et al., 2021) and millions worldwide are wildlife-dependent for food security and in­ come (Montgomery and Macdonald, 2020), there is also concern that a wildlife trade ban could undermine human rights and un­ dermine sustainable development longer term (Roe et al., 2020). Scholars highlighting the merits of the wildlife trade, like Yang et al. (2020), Koh et al. (2021) and Xiao et al. (2021), flagged blanket ban weak spots, including how to reduce harm to wildlife farm owners, and ensure policies and measures are in place to support farmers' livelihoods. As wildlife breeding and trade are big businesses, seen by many countries as a poverty reduction tool, solutions must address both conservation and development concerns (You, 2020). Yet limited empirical evidence exists on the pandemic's economic repercussions for those depending on wildlife farming for their live­ lihoods (Mcnamara et al., 2020) to inform such solutions.",1,infectious,True,Test
"This paper's objective is thus to examine impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on wildlife farms and discuss implications for future wildlife policies in Vietnam. Vietnam is an Asian wildlife trade hotspot (Nash, 2019; Dinh, 2020; Nguyen and Dinh, 2020). Reported cases, both of illegal wildlife trading and of wildlife animals being rescued, have increased sharply over the last five years (Vietnam News, 2021; Vietnam News Agency, 2021, VietNamNet Global 2021). And while the government perceives wildlife farming to contribute significantly to local livelihoods and rural development (Nguyen et al., 2007), it also acknowledges the threat illegal wildlife trading poses to degrading national biodiversity. The COVID-19 pandemic has also intensified national debate around wildlife trading, with civil society organizations pressing the government to strengthen policies as they advocate to ban wildlife farming and trading (The Guardian, 2020). On 23 July 2020, the Prime Minister of Vietnam issued Directive 29/CT-TTg, outlining urgent measures to tighten wildlife management; this included suspending wildlife imports, strengthening law enforcement, and stricter local-level monitoring of wildlife farming activities (Prime Minister of Vietnam, 2020). This regulation stirred new hope for conservation communities wishing to reduce the wildlife trade (Nguyen, 2020a), despite concerns about the potential for it to turn into an empty promise (Environmental Investigation Agency, 2020). While various media outlets report the pandemic's limited impact on slowing or reducing wildlife trading activities (Bui and Quan, 2021; Nguyen, 2021b), there is scant scientific evidence to support this; under­ standing these impacts is key, both to design appropriate interventions to support local people to mitigate such impacts, and to inform effective policymaking around wildlife conservation in Vietnam.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"We began by reviewing relevant literature to identify areas with large numbers of wildlife farms, before interviewing two central government agencies and three NGOs engaged in designing and monitoring wildlife conservation policies, to identify potential sites and knowledge gaps. From this we identified four potential research sites in the provinces of Thanh Pho Ho Chi Minh, Binh Duong, Ba Ria Vung Tau and Dong Nai. Over 70 % of Vietnamese wildlife farms are in the Southern region (Vietnam News, 2020), and these four provinces see large numbers of wildlife farming activities (Dard, 2007; Nguyen, 2010; Luong, 2018, Pannature, 2020, Le, 2021, Nguyen, 2021a, Sang, 2021). The research team then visited these four provinces to validate reported data, consult stakeholders and obtain research approval. Based on this, the research team chose Binh Duong and Ba Ria Vung Tau as the locations for the study sites. This was partly due to research approval by local government offices. As such, future research in the remaining two provinces would provide a more comprehensive regional overview and ensure site selection has not impacted results; for example, governmental willingness to participate may reflect differing local perspectives, compared with those of locations more reticent to be surveyed.",1,area,True,Test

Illegal wildlife trading activities and weak compliance with legislation are still widely reported in the province, however (ThienNhien.Net 2020, Phuc, 2021); this could point to another possi­ bility - that wildlife farming has gone underground since the pandemic linked its origins with wildlife trade.",1,pandemic,True,Test

"impacted by the pandemic. Those who were explained it was because the pandemic meant they were unable to sell their products, as markets closed (25 %), tourists were unable to visit their facilities (25 %), restaurants could not open due to lockdowns (50 %) and there had been increased costs for hiring laborers (75 %), without profit being generated. Households in both provinces shared that many brokers had forced small-scale farms to sell them their wildlife at low cost, so they could make more profit post-pandemic. Lockdowns and stricter wildlife conservation policies meant households were unable to sell wildlife products overseas and to other provinces, so they resorted to trading illegally within their provinces without informing government officers.",1,pandemic,True,Test
"However, the majority of households across both provinces (60 % in Binh Duong and 88 % in Ba Ria Vung Tau) claimed the pandemic had a minor impact on them as wildlife farming was not their primary income source (less than 30 % of the household budget); their main income sources were other businesses, like hostel services and restaurants (Fig. 3). These households highlighted that the scale at which they operated was relatively small (less than 10 individual animals), and they mostly supplied domestic, rather than international markets.",1,pandemic,True,Test
"The number of surveyed households claiming to be affected in Ba Ria Vung Tau was much less than in Binh Duong province (12 % compared with 40 %). This was for three reasons. First, some survey respondents in Ba Ria Vung Tau had moved to online sales through social media platforms like Zalo and Facebook, meaning they were not seriously affected by COVID-19 lockdowns. Second, as Binh Duong was a COVID-19 hotspot in the South (Phuoc, 2021) its lockdown was longer than that of Ba Ria Vung Tau (Hoang, 2021). Third, most Ba Ria Vung Tau wildlife farmers targeting domestic markets also had restaurants, so they could continue selling meat products during the pandemic; in contrast Binh Duong farm owners rely on selling to other provinces, notably Ho Chi Minh City, which was another COVID-19 hotspot with a lengthy lockdown period.",1,social,True,Test

"While acknowledging the pandemic's partial contribution to the decline in wildlife farms, both central and provincial government interviewees highlighted that this decline was also partly due to the accumulative impacts of a declining Chinese market (which began long before the pandemic), as well as stricter policies and law enforcement around wildlife trading and farm expansion. Although Binh Duong government officers shared that farm owners were no longer informing officials of their wildlife sales since the pandemic, they also acknowledged insufficient data on wildlife trade transactions to confirm their hypothesis. A Ba Ria Vung Tau government officer also added that weak law enforcement around illegal wildlife trade provided little disincentive to prevent local people from committing crimes.",1,pandemic,True,Test

"The study also found both similarities and differences between the two provinces in terms of wildlife farm owners' post-pandemic strategies (Table 6).

Rather than expanding individual numbers of specific species, however, these households planned to increase the overall number of animals raised.",1,pandemic,True,Test
"The difference here could be explained by several factors. As wildlife farming households in Binh Duong operate at a smaller scale, most have limited capital to invest in large-scale farming. The pandemic's impact on household income has thus led several households to have weaker capacity and interest in maintaining and expanding their operations. In contrast, many Ba Ria Vung Tau households were able to continue sales of wildlife products in the domestic market, and few were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; expansion is thus seen as strategy to overcome any setbacks experienced due to the pandemic and improve future income.",1,pandemic,True,Test

While previous studies show COVID-19 lockdowns affected the in­ comes of similar wildlife businesses elsewhere in the world (Mcginlay et al., 2020, Abeli Shoo et al., 2021, Cahyadi and Newsome, 2021, Rahman et al., 2021, Spenceley et al., 2021), in Vietnam just a few surveyed wildlife farms believed COVID-19 had seriously affected their businesses; wildlife-related income contributing less than 30 % to most households' income in Ba Ria Vung Tau and Binh Duong provinces. This minor impact has several implications for future wildlife conservation policies.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"First, our paper supports previous studies, which highlight that effective wildlife conservation policies and projects need to pri­ oritize the diversification of livelihood options (Cherkaoui et al., 2020; Abeli Shoo et al., 2021; Mcelwee et al., 2020) to reduce financial dependence on wildlife farming. Second, our paper flags a significant data gap when it comes to legal and illegal operations. The current monitoring and evaluation system relies on reported numbers of registered wildlife farms. However, this monitoring indicator does not give a comprehensive understanding of the scope and scale of operations. A reduced number of farms does not necessarily indicate less wildlife farming; such a decline could mean a local shift from offline to online markets, as our study found, or that wildlife farming has become more secretive since the pandemic. This would explain the increasing number of reported violations around illegal trade in Binh Duong province (Dinh, 2019; Le, 2019), and flags the further challenges policymakers now face in monitoring the wildlife trade. When animals are bred for human consumption and local people want to expand the scale of this en­ terprise, this raises a flag of alarm for biodiversity conservation.",1,pandemic,True,Test
"Stakeholders' concerns around the government's limited ability to oversee and monitor wildlife farms have led to some conser­ vationists advocating for a wildlife trade ban in Vietnam (Nguyen, 2020b). However, both the banning and sustainable management of wildlife trading remain controversial (Bennett et al., 2021). A ban could reduce the risk of emerging infectious diseases (Aguirre et al., 2020), and prevent the biodiversity destruction that results from wildlife farms `laundering' wild animals to sell onto other farms (Brooks et al., 2010). On the other hand, the fact that some households raise wildlife for food and felt wildlife farming was their best plan post-pandemic highlights that a blanket ban could both be logistically challenging to implement, and negatively impact devel­ opment and human rights (Roe et al., 2020). With farmers determined to expand and maintain their farms to respond to continued demand, our paper shows that addressing the wildlife trade nationally depends on a major shift in global wildlife consumption patterns (Li et al., 2021).",1,infectious,True,Test
"Several studies emphasize that policymakers will need to adopt a participatory approach to decision making, to ensure that future use and trade of wildlife is safe, environmentally sustainable and socially equitable (Booth et al., 2021, 2021). Our paper reveals a critical concern around wildlife farming - farmers' lack of knowledge and awareness around veterinary requirements, animal health and human safety. Households surveyed in both provinces are currently raising diverse species in their farms, with weak understanding around human and animal health implications. Further research is needed to understand how species differences in terms of legality and welfare might impact human health, local incomes and people's responses to government policies.",1,social,True,Test
"Our study showed domestic restaurants are a key market for many Vietnamese wildlife farm owners, yet there remains limited understanding around consumer segmentation, with a corresponding lack of appropriate behavioral interventions (Olmedo et al., 2021). Previous studies meanwhile show an influx of coronaviruses from the wildlife supply chain into Vietnamese restaurants, suggesting risk for end-consumers, since this likely underpins zoonotic spillover to people (Huong et al., 2020).

"emphasizes the need to increase local access to veterinary services and knowledge on veterinary standards (Gorta´zar and de la Fuente 2020). There are limited studies and analysis to uncover these risks, however, nor policies in place to address them. As well as strengthening policies and law enforcement, government agencies must also conduct awareness campaigns and undertake appropriate policy interventions so as to reduce consumer demand for wildlife products domestically. Rigorous research and impact evaluation on the effectiveness of these campaigns is equally essential (Nuno et al., 2018; Veríssimo and Wan, 2019; Thomas-Walters et al., 2021). For government agencies focused on public health and wildlife, it is critically important to assess diverse wildlife trade situations for the risk of potentially serious zoonotic diseases, so as to inform policy design and ensure appropriate policy interventions (Wikra­ manayake et al., 2021).",1,disease,True,Test
5. Conclusion,0,,False,Test
"This paper examined the various impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Vietnamese wildlife farms, as well as wildlife farm owners' strategies in response to the pandemic. Our findings show that although COVID-19 did affect local incomes, the extent of this impact depended on how diversified household income streams were, the scale of farming operations, and whether farm owners were able to adapt their business models (for example, by moving from offline to online trade). Our paper also highlights some key challenges for implementing a wildlife trade ban, particularly when most wildlife farmers intend to maintain or expand their wildlife farms postpandemic. As many farmers raise wildlife for family food, any future ban would also affect their dietary requirements. A particular challenge for wildlife management in Vietnam is weak understanding among wildlife farmers around wildlife policies, human-animal health risks, and how to implement environmental safeguards and human health measures so as to prevent risks. Addressing these challenges requires policy commitment, as well as participatory decision-making processes and capacity building among wildlife farm owners. Future research is also needed to document both the longer-term impacts of the pandemic on Vietnamese wildlife farms, and how government and farm owners respond to COVID-19 and wildlife conservation policies, so as to inform appropriate policy interventions.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

ABSTRACT,0,,False,Test
"The recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a significant and topmost global health challenge of today. SARS-CoV-2 can propagate through several direct or indirect means resulting in its exponential spread in short times. Consequently, finding new research based real-world and feasible solutions to interrupt the spread of pathogenic microorganisms is indispensable. It has been established that this virus can survive on a variety of available surfaces ranging from a few hours to a few days, which has increased the risk of COVID-19 spread to large populations. Currently, available surface disinfectant chemicals provide only a temporary solution and are not recommended to be used in the long run due to their toxicity and irritation. Apart from the urgent development of vaccine and antiviral drugs, there is also a need to design and develop surface disinfectant antiviral coatings for long-term applications even for new variants. The unique physicochemical properties of graphene-based nanomaterials (GBNs) have been widely investigated for antimicrobial applications. However, the research work for their use in antimicrobial surface coatings is minimal. This perspective enlightens the scope of using GBNs as antimicrobial/antiviral surface coatings to reduce the spread of transmittable microorganisms, precisely, SARS-CoV-2. This study attempts to demonstrate the syner­ gistic effect of GBNs and metallic nanoparticles (MNPs), for their potential antiviral applications in the devel­ opment of surface disinfectant coatings. Some proposed mechanisms for the antiviral activity of the graphene family against SARS-CoV-2 has also been explained. It is anticipated that this study will potentially lead to new insights and future trends to develop a framework for further investigation on this research area of pivotal importance to minimize the transmission of current and any future viral outbreaks.",1,respiratory,True,Test

"Despite the tremendous amount of research in virology and the development of hundreds of vaccines, viruses are still the leading cause of infectious diseases in humans [1,2]. It has been found in previous studies that infectious viruses have significantly threatened human health globally and are mostly responsible for both acute and chronic infectious diseases. There has been a sustained multidirectional research switch towards developing and exploring activities in various directions to reduce the horrific and lethal attacks of this new pandemic, ""Coro­ navirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). One of the most common",1,vaccine,True,Test
"transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2 is through various viral contami­ nated surfaces, which humans frequently expose in everyday life. Touching our mouth, nose, or eyes after touching a surface or object with a virus on it may lead to COVID-19. So, it is imperative to disinfect the surfaces by inactivating the virus immediately to stop its spread [3]. Although many cleaning and disinfectant solutions like 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, or 0.1 sodium hypochlorite are available in the market, these are temporary solutions and have many reported side ef­ fects [4]. Therefore, the remedial solutions in antiviral coatings with long-term durability with low toxicity should be considered [5].",1,transmission,True,Test

"nanotechnology is a better alternative solution to shrink the COVID-19 spread, particularly in healthcare facilities and public places [6,7]. Graphene-based nanomaterials (GBNs) can be used to develop efficient diagnostic devices, effective personal protective equipment (PPE), 3D printed medical and engineering components and surface protective coatings for SARS-CoV-2. Antiviral nano-coatings can be used to desta­ bilize, disinfect and minimize the survival time on different surfaces [8-10]. From the quantitative analysis of published research articles using the SCOPUS database for searching specific keywords for gra­ phene and antimicrobial activity, as shown in Fig. 1(B), it can be found that there is an incremental rise in this research area, especially in the last few years. From the year 2010, graphene compounds got more importance for investigating applications as antimicrobial agents, pri­ marily focusing on bacteria and viruses [11].",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Graphene and its derivatives both show a wide range of antimicro­ bial activity including various types of viruses [9,12-14]. Among these materials, graphene oxide (GO), with the highest negative charge, show a higher affinity for positively charged viruses. It has been investigated that lipid bilayer of feline coronavirus can be adsorbed on GO and reduced GO (rGO) surfaces by electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding [15]. Later on, this binding destroyed the viral membrane, thus confirming the GO efficacy against viruses [12,16]. The negatively charged antiviral materials such as heparin, drugs, and heparan sulfate have also been used to modify the GO surface by conjugation [17], which resulted into the increased affinity of GO with positively charged residues of the viruses [18]. Similarly, modified rGO with sulfate de­ rivatives can wipe out herpes virus strains and orthopox virus [19].",1,negative,True,Test
"Zen Graphene Solutions Ltd. (dealing with graphene applications) has proposed a composite ink using GO and Ag nanoparticles, as an effective virucide that can eradicate the earlier strains of coronavirus by its application on N95 masks and other fabrics for frontline workers [20]. A company known as ""G6 Materials"" is working on development of air filtration system by incorporating graphene that can be used in of­ fices and warehouses to kill viruses [21]. Another technology using self-sterilized laser-induced graphene (LIG) has been developed for water filters that eliminate viruses and bacteria in water and the same can be employed on masks and heating or air-conditioning system for air filtration to reduce the risk of COVID-19 [22].",1,coronavirus,True,Test
"A study conducted by Hanaa et al. [23] and Kim et al. [24] suggested that GO can target the mRNA of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) to block the replication of HCV gene. Both GO, and rGO show antiviral properties due to their distinctive single-layer configuration, sharp edges and negatively charged surfaces, whereas, graphite (Gt) and graphite oxide (GtO), show negligible antiviral activity. So, it can be concluded that the presence of various surface functional groups, nanosheet structure and sharp edges all are important features to exhibit antiviral properties [23,",1,negative,True,Test

"Innocenzi et al. [26] suggested in his perspective that carbon-based materials along with polyphenol and Ag-NPs composites show good antiviral properties based on single oxygen emission and virus capture mechanism, in which GO interacts with, heparan sulfate of virus and destroy its envelope. Zhong et al. [27] reported using few-layer gra­ phene in face masks coating due to its superhydrophobic properties, which inhibit the adhering of virus-containing aerosols. However, it needs laser treatment and sunlight to make it reusable. Other re­ searchers have explored the use of GBNs in nano-vaccines as drug de­ livery agents, biosensors for diagnostic purposes and antiviral nanocomposites [8,26-31]. Srivastava et al. [27] proposed many gra­ phene family applications in the current pandemic, including graphene-based composites for 3D printing masks and as surface coating materials. Some authors have proposed few mechanisms to demonstrate the extraordinary antimicrobial properties of GBNs [9,16,26,32].",1,mask,True,Test
"Material safety data do not allow the use of virucidal chemicals as disinfectant sprays due to their toxicity and other adverse effects. It may cause health issues for the skin and lungs depending upon concentration and duration of exposure [33]. The most popular disinfectants used for cleaning and fogging the surfaces are chemicals like sodium hypochlo­ rite and hypochlorous acid, which show corrosive nature for various metallic surfaces and residue is also left behind the surface. Continuous use of these chemicals causes mild to severe irritation to the skin, throat and eyes and are not acceptable for hands cleaning or fogging in the long run [34-36].",0,,False,Test
"This perspective mainly focuses on the use of GBNs for antiviral surface coatings at high-risk areas in hospitals, schools, and public places where the risk of spread is very high. After reviewing the previ­ ously proposed mechanisms for antibacterial properties of GBNs, a novel surface coating has been proposed in the current perspective using GBNs, metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) and some reported non-ionic polymeric materials. The synergistic antimicrobial effect of these ma­ terials can be applied to develop robust antiviral coatings that can be applied in a spray or paint on many surfaces. Previously, the role of GBNs in antiviral surface coatings with various proposed mechanisms and future trends has not been reviewed as an independent topic.",1,area,True,Test

"All viruses, including COVID-19, need a living host for replication. It can stay on most surfaces and enter the host body on contact with these surfaces, which is an alarming situation for frequently touched surfaces to increase COVID-19 spread. The work done by Kampf et al. [62] in­ dicates that this virus can stay for up to 9 days at temperatures above 30 C on some surfaces. The new research explained the variable sur­ vival time of SARS-CoV-2 on various plastic, metals, and wood surfaces. Data from different sources have been compared in Fig. 2, showing the virus's stability on different surfaces using almost similar experimental conditions like temperature and concentration and exposure time as reported by few authors [3,62,63].",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"It has been suggested that various surfaces in hospitals and public places should be adequately disinfected so that the virus cannot stay activated for more extended periods. Researchers concluded through laser beam guidance experiments that a sneeze could produce almost 100,000 particles in an experiment at Toho University in Japan. These particles can be a potential carrier of thousands of viruses that can be categorized into large vs small droplets or sometimes called droplets vs aerosols [64]. It was observed that lighter aerosols might be airborne for a few hours whereas heavy droplets can fall on the various available surface causing the spread of infection. The pieces of evidence concluded that the disease had been worsened to a pandemic due to the high infection rate occurring via `airborne' aerosols [54,65].",1,droplet,True,Test
"Viruses are more stable on plastic and stainless steel (SS) than on cardboard and copper and the viable virus was detected up to 72 h when exposed to these surfaces. However, Goel et al.

The shortest survival time is observed on copper, where the half-life of the virus is 46 min as compared to plastic, where its half-life is 6 h and 49 min [68]. The virus activity is also dependent upon the environmental conditions and surface temperature. Generally, it has been noted that it is more active at lower temperature and colder surfaces as compared to high temperature and hotter surfaces [69].",1,mask,True,Test

"(i) Lateral Size: The adsorption, dispersion, and sharp edges are hugely affected by the particle size; these properties are, in turn, pivotal in microorganism's physicochemical interaction [73]. The larger the lateral size, the stronger the adsorption ability, which is attributed to the higher surface energies. An investiga­ tive study stated that antimicrobial effects were stronger in as­ sociation with larger-sized GO sheets than with smaller sheets [74]. For example, GO sheet size was found to influence its antimicrobial activity in suspension due to the capacity of larger sheets to completely wrap around the cells and isolate them from their environment [75]. Significant differences were found in the antiviral activities among GO and rGO, which may be attributed to their different nanosheet structures as shown in Fig. 3 (a-b). Mostly GO appears to bigger sized sheets as compared to rGO but it also depends on adopted synthetic method and post treatment.",1,flu,True,Test
"(ii) Number of Layers: Increase of number of graphene layers in­ crease the thickness, causing a weakened ""nano knife"" effect, decreased dispersibility, and increased aggregation tendency, resulting in reduced contact between GBNs and microorganisms [74,77].

"(iii) Cytotoxicity due to negatively charged groups: GO and rGO both contain groups of negative charge elements which are responsible for their antiviral characteristics. However, GO has the highest negative charge, which can have a higher affinity for positively charged viruses [32]. Subsequently, the binding of these graphene-derived materials with viruses can destroy the viral membrane. These groups include mainly hydroxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl, which result into redox reactions between the graphene oxide layer and the viruses due to the physico-chemical process which act as an important parameter in destroying the viruses. It should be noted that GO and rGO have an intrinsic ability to adsorb charged lipids and destroy membranes after association with their aromatic plane [10]. This property has been used to explain GO activity against feline corona- virus [16]. It has been reported that lipid bilayer of feline coronavirus is adsorbed on the surface of GO and rGO through hydrogen bonding and electro­ static interactions.

"negatively charged groups of GO and the positively charged virus particles blocks viral bindings [78]. Ye et al. [79] reported the antimicrobial and antiviral activity of graphene and its de­ rivatives and its cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the charge density also play a crucial role in the binding and destruction of viruses as it has been demonstrated by Matias Sametband et al. that GO and rGO- SO3 blocked HSV-1 infections, and they believe that the charge density is probably the dominant factor affecting the in­ hibition properties, and GO has higher charge density as compared to rGO however GO and rGO- SO3 have roughly the same charge density [80]. (iv) Particles Shape (sharp edges): An interesting finding demon­ strated that the sharp edges of GO nanowalls (GONWs) and rGO nanowalls (rGNWs) significantly decreased the rate of survival of both bacteria and viruses [81]. Experimental evidences show that the sharp edges of GONWs and rGNWs inactivate the virus before it enters the cells and these sharp edges of graphene layers inactivate the attack of viruses through direct association with outer layer leading to destruction of Viral Morphology and viral function [32]. These sharp edges are actually irregular nano-walls of GO and rGO layers, which may also develop due to the presence of dangling bonds, representing at least two times greater reactivity in comparison with the basal plane [78,82]. (v) Surface Modifications/surface functionalization: Modification of graphene's surface or edge characteristics via covalent and noncovalent modulation has been found to play a key role in pre­ venting particle agglomeration and, consequently, influencing their antimicrobial activities [82,83]. It has been found that graphene-based surfaces both GO and rGO can improve the antiviral surfaces and coatings due to their antifouling properties for microorganisms including corona virus when used with different functional materials (i.e. silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), metal oxides and polymers) [78]. Similarly, rGO modified with sulfate derivatives effectively ex- terminate herpesvirus strains, swine fever, and orthopoxvirus [12,19]. Functionalized graphene materials can prevent cellular viral infections based on the interaction between negatively charged functional groups which imitate the cell surface heparan sulfate [19]. It has been reported that the flake sizes of around 300 nm along with around 10% functionalization could provide the optimum performance against viruses [18]. (vi) Agglomeration and Dispersion: Agglomeration weakens the dis­ persibility and adsorption capacity, which alters blade efficacy and consequently reduces their interaction with the microor­ ganisms [74]. However, these properties differ among the different forms of graphene, with GO dispersion exhibiting the most potent antimicrobial activity followed by rGO, graphite (Gt), and graphite oxide, successively [84]. The proper dispersion of GO results in thin sheets of this nanomaterial which is capable of easily wrapping the viruses and bacteria, whereas rGO exhibits aggregate formation and reduced impact when it is not fully exfoliated [74].",1,negative,True,Test

"While focussing the current pandemic, it has been found that contaminated surfaces are the second main cause for the virus spread [45]. So, sterilization of frequently used surfaces like doorknobs, elevator buttons, handrails in the public area and hospitals should be done to block the transmission. Currently employed surface disinfectant chemicals like sodium hypochlorite (bleach), hydrogen peroxide or alcohol are temporary measures until the next exposure to the virus and also poisonous and irritants when overused for a prolonged time [36, 86]. Novel surface coatings can be formulated and designed by using GBNs, MNPs and some sulfonated polymers to overcome the current challenge. These coatings offer long-term antimicrobial activity against germs when applied or sprayed on frequently touched surfaces [4,13, 31]. Based on the graphene family's unique physical and chemical as­ pects and high surface area, their antimicrobial ability has also been extended to viruses [87,88]. The antimicrobial mechanism of graphene materials is still debatable among the scientific community; however, few possibilities have been explained based on some experimental evi­ dence [89-91].",1,pandemic,True,Test
"Three main mechanisms have been proposed for the working of antimicrobial surfaces, which include (i) anti-biofouling mechanism, (ii) release killing mechanism, and (iii) contact killing mechanism, as shown in Fig. 4. Anti-biofouling mechanism repels microbes and prevents them from adhering to the surface which is due to customized super­ hydrophobic properties in case of GBNs. In release killing mechanism, antimicrobial agents and reactive oxygen species are produced near the surface which causes cytoplasmic efflux, decreases metabolism, affects lipid membrane, induces oxidative stress and finally causes microbial death. In the contact killing mechanism, sharp edges or nano-knives of GBNs due to their single or few layer structure play their role in the nearsurface to kill the incoming microbes and instantly damaging the mi­ crobial agents if adhered to the surface [25,66,92].",1,contact,True,Test
"It has been reported that the antimicrobial action of copper nano­ particles is due to their oxidative behavior and the solubility properties of its oxides [93]. It was observed by Sametband et al. [80] that even small concentrations of partially reduced sulfonated GO (rGO-SO3) and GO could deactivate herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) infection. Some au­ thors have analyzed the interaction between bacteria and GBNs con­ taining surfaces [94-97]. Similarly, graphene-WO2 composite thin film has also been applied in the photo-inhibition of viruses [98]. Another study performed by Hu et al. [99] investigated GO functioned aptamer, a new photocatalyst that destructed the virus proteins capsid and nucleic acids under irradiation. Furthermore, GO, and copper composite mate­ rials can be used effectively for the surface disinfection and inactivation of viruses to prevent further propagation [66]. Few graphene-based composite coatings showing antimicrobial activity have been reported by deposition on titanium, stainless steel (SS) [81] and copper (Cu) [100]. The graphene's biocidal activity varies with the surface as for SS, it is 95% and reduced to 34% when Cu is used [101]. From the discus­ sion above, it has become clear that GBNs and some other MNPs find great potential in antiviral applications in various fields, mainly due to the availability of more surface-active sites, excellent chemical stability and conductivity [102,103]. These magnificent features allow these materials to be applied in many other antimicrobial fields such as water disinfection, wound disinfection, dental care, and treatment.",0,,False,Test

Its unique characteristics, like single-layer structure and negative surface charge, are mainly responsible for antiviral effects [29,108,109]. From the previous study, it has been found that the graphene family shows significant antiviral activity for a broad range of viruses belonging to different virus families, as shown in Table 2.

"A study conducted by Ye et al. [29] uncovered the role of ionic character of GO for its antiviral action against two RNA viruses namely, PEDV (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, a member of corona family) and PRV (pseudorabies virus). Polymer composites of GO with poly (dia­ llyldimethylammonium chloride) (GO-PDDA), and poly­ vinylpyrrolidone (GO-PVP) have been investigated for antiviral activity. It was observed that GO-PVP shows antiviral activity due to nonionic nature of PVP, whereas cationic PDDA shows no antiviral activity. It has been proved through this study that GO shows antiviral properties against both RNA and DNA viruses which were later confirmed by Western blot analysis, plaque formation and indirect immunofluores­ cence assays. As shown in Fig. 5 (A & B) that in the absence of GO, the cell cultures show typical cytopathic effects whereas on GO treated cultures, the plaque formation unit (pfu) has been drastically reduced from 5 × 107 pfu/mL to 2.5 × 105 pfu/mL which also confirmed the antiviral nature of GO [29]. It was also concluded that these materials' broad-spectrum antiviral activity also depends on their concentration and time of exposure. Based on the current discussion, it can be sum­ marized that both GO and rGO practice almost same antiviral mecha­ nism, which may be credited to their negative surface charge and nanosheet structure [26,31]. The mechanism of cell membrane rupture through charge transfer has been explained well by Li et al. [127] as shown in Fig. 5(C).

Due to GO nanosheets, amphiphilic proper­ ties, partial hydrophobic surfaces and some hydrophilic spots show more interaction to the microorganisms.

6. Mechanism of action of GBNs against viruses,0,,False,Test
"Various proposed mechanisms have explained the antimicrobial ac­ tivity of GBNs. Mainly three mechanisms are extensively reported in the literature: production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress at the membrane, and phospholipids [84,129,130]. Some other reported mechanisms are the physical interaction of graphene's sharp edges with microbial membranes, photo-thermal ablation, and mechanical wrap­ ping, leading to cell lysis [131,132]. There are three stages of antimi­ crobial action of graphene (i) deposition of virus onto the graphene material, (ii) membrane stress by direct contact with sharp nanosheets, and (iii) superoxide anion-independent oxidation [133]. Some re­ searchers mentioned two main mechanisms for the germicidal nature of graphene sheets, i.e. physical disruption [81,134] and oxidative stress [135,136]. Previous studies have demonstrated that GBNs can penetrate the cell membrane for physical disruption and rupture [134,137]. The study conducted by Akhavan and Ghaderi [81] concluded that when GO nanosheets were coated on stainless steel, destruction of E. coli or S. aureus membranes occurred mainly due to the direct contact of the bacteria with extremely sharp edges of the nanowalls [137]. So, sharp edges play a significant role in the mechanical damage of bacteria cells as smooth surfaces cannot physically disrupt the cell membrane.",1,contact,True,Test

"the macromolecules like DNA and RNA, protein, and lipid bilayer of microorganisms. In the first step of the mechanism, virus envelope damage starts from the GO's interactions with the outer wall, which can lead to excessive ROS generation and virus inactivation [131]. Physi­ cochemical features and alterations in GO sheets, e.g., sheet size and attached functional groups, may also have a diverse effect when employed on a surface. The bactericidal activity of GBNs has been criticized by Hegeb et al. due to unclarified effect of the physicochemical features like shape, size, hydrophilicity, roughness and functionality of these materials on their antibacterial activity, but the same can be justified based on variations in the physicochemical properties for in­ dividual samples [23].",1,,True,Test
"Generally, two approaches have been investigated to understand the inactivation mechanism of enveloped viruses, which include physical interaction and incorporation of additional features. Physical interac­ tion is based on the interaction between the outer S-protein layer of a virus and the surface of the nanosystem to inhibit the virus activity directly. The antiviral function of GBNs is dependent upon their physi­ cochemical properties. On the other hand, the second approach focuses on developing additional features on nanosystems' surface to kill the virus completely. Synergised action of both methods can be sufficient to fight against SARS-CoV-2. The first approach is preferable as various functional groups can be introduced in graphene oxide, binding with these viruses and inactivating them. For binding and entering of viruses into the host cell, the virus must first interact with the host cell surface receptors. It has been reported by Song et al. [15] that GO was able to efficiently destroy the coating proteins available on corona viruses and extracting the viral RNA in an aqueous environment due to the presence of hydroxyls, epoxides, diols, ketones, or carboxylic functional groups located on its surface. Furthermore, viral envelope glycoproteins, hep­ aran sulfate proteoglycans and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans func­ tion as the cell surface receptors and the functionalized GBNs having negatively charged functional groups can mimic cell surface heparan sulfate [19]. Still, these efforts are mainly restricted to proof-of-concept scenarios; however, some limited reports proposed the application of nanosystems on surfaces, personal protection equipment, and water purification. Based on these mechanisms, it has been proposed that graphene-based nanomaterials can be effectively used for antiviral ap­ plications [26,31,138].",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test

Smart and modern technologies, especially exploiting emerging nanotech­ nology, could help manage the current and future outbreaks. As already discussed, GBNs, particularly GO and rGO exhibit antimicrobial prop­ erties, but due to agglomeration problems, metal ions/oxides in the form of nanoparticles (NPs) have been incorporated to modify the surface properties and antimicrobial action.",1,vaccine,True,Test
"A few studies have reported the antiviral activity of fully dispersed GO sheets and found that GBNs can prevent the entry of DNA virus (herpesvirus) and RNA virus (coronavirus) in their target cells [29,80, 139]. Various inorganic MNPs (Ag, Au, Zn, Ge, Si, Cu) have been suc­ cessfully used to enhance the antimicrobial effect of GBNs due to their photocatalytic properties and production of ROS [140]. It has been suggested that GO-based virucidal mist spray can be used to clean any object's surface and even for sanitization of the human body. The mist spray can be formulated as nasal or mouth spray to block the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, especially at the entry points. Interestingly, graphene-coated surface cleaner wipes can better disinfect the infected area [12]. A company (GrapheneCA) has formulated a graphene-based antimicrobial coating that can be applied in the form of paints and varnishes to walls and surfaces of public use that are high-risk areas like shopping malls, metro stations, airports and hospitals. The coating will act to inactivate the outer surface of microorganisms on physical contact [141]. Nano-coatings using N9 blue silver and zinc based nano­ complexes have been used for their synergistic effect as antimicrobial nano-coatings. These nano-coatings are found very convincing and can work on multiple levels simultaneously as antiviral, antibacterial, anti­ fungal and self-cleaning [142-144]. A company named nanoSeptic introduced a nano touch product using mineral nanocrystals charged by any visible light and proved for the breakdown of organic contaminants, including coronavirus envelope using oxidation reaction [110]. Simi­ larly, another Italian company, Nanotech Surface, presented some self-sterilizing and self-cleaning nanosheets using silver and titanium oxide, which can be used on buildings and other surfaces. The company has claimed that the surface remains effective against pathogenic or­ ganisms, including coronavirus, from 6 to 24 months [145].",1,coronavirus,True,Test

These investigations show that GO-Ag-NPs can be used for the fabrication of coatings against SARS-CoV-2.

This theory is presented based on recent research showing the sustainability of this virus in the air for more than three hours, and its aerosol particle has supported movement up to eight meters [55].",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"There are some limitations and challenges while using GBNs in antiviral applications. Nanotoxicity is a major limitation. Although toxicity of graphene is still a matter of debate however, a few researchers have already found the evidence of their toxic effects [147,148]. Im­ mediate use of graphene for antiviral surface coatings looks difficult due to insufficient data and still more research is needed. Graphene based nano materials can cross biological barriers due to their nano size however these are less cytotoxic as compared to other carbon nano­ materials. There are also limitations related to costs and processing of such type of coatings at different surfaces. Furthermore problems asso­ ciated with accuracy, repeatability, specificity, and sensitivity, can be faced due to the high genetic variability of several viruses [28]. After devising appropriate solutions for toxic concerns such as preparation of hybrid coatings with eco-friendly nanomaterials and MNPs can reduce their minor toxic effects. These materials can be produced in a cost-effective way using waste biomass to further reduce the processing costs [149,150]. GBNs can be combined with green technology using hybrid nanotechnologies for their synthesis, use, storage, recycle and environmental-friendly disposal [28]. Graphene materials possess su­ perior mechanical, thermal and chemical properties and show high resistance to harsh environmental conditions [89,151]. These can be used to develop robust antiviral coatings that can be used at various environmental conditions without affecting their performance and life span. Further experimental work is required in this area that can smoothen the way towards the development of safe and cheaper anti­ viral coatings.",1,area,True,Test
"The investigation of the antiviral properties and utilization of carbon nanomaterials or GBNs is yet a new research field, and further study is required to evaluate the potential benefits in this area. However, carbon nanomaterials can be used to make antiviral systems having reduced toxicity and human friendly. A complete assessment of cytotoxicity is the main problem for allowing the development of antiviral applications for such type of materials. The current pandemic has already taught us some important lessons to consider in terms of future antiviral material development. Due to the evolution of unpredictable bacterial and viral infections, there is a dire need to highlight the future research areas for a precise assessment of the antimicrobial activity of the different forms of graphene-based materials for targeted applications. There is an urgent requirement to identify and develop possible treatments and approaches to block S-protein or exterminate the SARS-CoV-2 after its access to the human body.

Hence, there is a strong demand for long-lasting and robust antiviral coatings that can be sprayed or painted on frequently used surfaces in hospitals, homes and public areas to restrain viral transmission. It has been proposed that GBNs and some activated MNPs can be used as long-lasting antiviral coatings to obstruct the spread of the current pandemic. These universal virucidal coatings can be applied for wide range of applications, not only against the corona­ virus platforms but also against any other future viruses and microbial agents. Similarly, self-disinfecting and reusable PPEs can also be smartly designed using these advanced materials, which may include face masks, protective clothing, and gloves.",1,transmission,True,Test
"Further research in this field is required to understand and find more possible mechanisms of action of GBNs having antiviral characteristics. New nanomaterials can be explored for the development of multipur­ pose efficient disinfection systems that can be applied on permanent basis having self-reactivation mechanisms. It has been proposed that new flexible and reusable GO incorporated cotton fabrics can be designed as a new antimicrobial material for many medical-related ap­ plications. Similarly, for antiviral drugs and vaccines, nano-vaccines can be developed where graphene material act as inactive Virus-Like Parti­ cles (VLPs). Multifunctional antimicrobial GBNs can prove as ideal products for environmental pollution protection, wastewater treatment, food safety and any other application where control of bacteria, fungi, and viruses is required. So, it is the pressing need of time to identify the long-term and short-term approaches that can be fully employed to cope with the current and any future unforeseen outbreak.

"Abstract Background: The Tablo® Hemodialysis System (Tablo) is an all in one, easy-to-learn device featuring integrated water purification, on demand dialysate production and two-way wireless data transmission and is approved for use in the acute, chronic, and home settings. Prior reports have demonstrated Tablo's ability to achieve clinical goals, seamlessly integrate into hospitals and reduce cost across a wide range of treatment times. Extension of the Tablo cartridge to 24 h allows prolonged therapy and even greater flexibility for prescribers in the acute setting. The objective is to report on the first ever experience with Tablo prolonged therapy between 12 and 24 h in critically ill patients treated at a single-center ICU.",1,transmission,True,Test
"Methods: Nursing staff were trained during a single training session on Tablo prolonged therapy. After a run-in period of five treatments, Tablo data were collected via real-time transmission to a cloud-based, HIPAA compliant platform and reviewed by site staff. Dialysis treatment delivery, clinically significant alarms, and clotting events were recorded. Sub-group analysis between COVID-19 positive and negative patients were reported.",1,transmission,True,Test
"Results: One hundred (100) consecutive Tablo prolonged treatments had a median prescribed treatment time of 24 h and a median achieved treatment time of 21.3 h. Median cartridge usage was 1.3 per treatment. The dialysis treatment time was delivered in 91% of treatments, with 6% ending early due to an alarm, and 3% ending due to clotting.",0,,False,Test
Clinically significant alarms occurred at a median rate of 0.5 per treatment hour with a resolution time of 18 s. Median blood pump stoppage time related to these alarms was 2.3 min per treatment. Blood pump stoppage time was higher in the COVID-19 subgroup when compared to the non-COVID-19 subgroup.,1,Clinical,True,Test
"Conclusion: Tablo successfully achieves prescribed treatment time with minimal therapy interruptions from alarms or cartridge changes. This data demonstrates the effectiveness of Tablo in achieving personalization of treatments necessary for unstable patients and enabling successful delivery of extended therapy with minimal clotting. Tablo's prolonged therapy meets the needs of critically patients, including COVID-19 positive patients, requiring renal replacement therapy for greater than 12 h.",1,personal,True,Test

"unit (ICU) [1, 2]. AKI occurs in up to half of all patients admitted to the ICU, and of these patients, 4-13% require RRT [1, 3]. While there are various RRT modalities available, including continuous, prolonged, and intermittent, meta-analyses have demonstrated minimal differences in clinical outcomes between these modalities [4]. However, ICU clinicians typically favor treatments of greater than 12 h for hemodynamically unstable patients [5-7], as they allow for more gradual fluid removal and solute clearance over the course of the treatments [5, 8].",1,clinical,True,Test
"The same severe illness that leads to the need for a prolonged therapy often results in organ failure beyond AKI; further complicating the treatment regimen with other critical lifesaving devices, such as mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy, that can lead to interdevice interaction and competition for vascular access [9, 10]. Prolonged therapy is frequently administered concurrently with ECMO, either independently or integrated into the circuit, to mitigate hemodynamic instability and fluid imbalance [11] presenting a highly complex and labor-intensive treatment regimen.",1,flu,True,Test
"The acuity of these patients, combined with the increased treatment time and slower blood flow rate, adds complexity to the effective delivery of prolonged therapies. The most common complication is associated with circuit clotting or clogging. Clotting in the filter or extracorporeal circuit may be exacerbated by compromised or inadequate vascular access [12]. Poor catheter function may trigger arterial and venous pressure alarms which stagnate extracorporeal blood flow, leading to increased blood pump stoppage that exacerbate clotting events [5, 13]. During the pandemic, the risk of clotting or clogging the circuit during prolonged therapies was further increased in COVID-19 positive patients with AKI due to the prothrombotic state induced by the disease process [14]. Clotting and clogging of the extracorporeal circuit can have significant impact on the ability to achieve ultrafiltration and metabolic clearance targets due to treatment interruptions. In addition to the risk of failing to achieve clinical goals, these interruptions drive up the cost of care due to increased supply utilization from repeated system set up [15], and create additional work for an already highly burdened critical care nursing staff [16].",1,pandemic,True,Test
"Taken together and compounded by the staffing shortages that have resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a critical need for simple, flexible RRT technology that can deliver effective therapy with minimal treatment interruption.

Median cartridge usage for the COVID-19+ECMO treatments was 1.8±1.5, with three treatments requiring greater than three cartridges to deliver the intended therapy.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Discussion The use of the Tablo Hemodialysis System for up to 24 h in this critically ill population resulted in high clinical treatment success, low cartridge utilization, minimal clotting, short average blood pump stoppage times and low rates of clinically significant alarms which were resolved quickly; irrespective of COVID status. These factors all likely contributed to the dialysis treatment time being delivered in 91% of treatments, with 99% of treatments achieving or exceeding target effluent rates of>20 ml/kg/hr [5].",1,clinical,True,Test
"Over the course of 100 treatments, only three treatments were discontinued due to visible clotting. Two of the three occurred in COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with the increased risk of circuit clotting reported in the literature [19]. There remained a single clotting event in a non-COVID-19 patient on a heparin drip.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"The rate of clinically significant alarms per 24-h treatment period was low and was accompanied by rapid alarm resolution. The mean blood pump stoppage time observed in this study (4.5±5.2 min per treatment), trended lower than previous reports from a conventional RRT device (6.7±9.5 min) [20]. The increase in blood pump stoppage times in the COVID-19 subgroup can be attributed to the higher number of total alarms per treatment and higher mean time to alarm resolution. The alarm resolution time in this subgroup was likely due to the need for ICU staff to don PPE prior to entry into the treatment room.",1,clinical,True,Test
"As previously mentioned, the COVID-19+ECMO patient was excluded from the broader analysis due to the increased complexity of managing both therapies within a single extracorporeal circuit. Increased alarm",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"rates were noted during the initial hours of therapy and were due to the adjustment of stopcock positioning to optimize the combined ECMO/Dialysis extracorporeal circuit (data not shown). This increased blood pump stoppage time may have contributed to the high cartridge usage that was observed with this patient. Additionally, while data concerning the incidence of clotting in RRT requiring COVID-19+ECMO patients are scarce, the existing literature supports that these patients are at an elevated risk of experiencing clotting events [11, 21] and may also have contributed to the results observed.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Strengths This is the first study to provide detailed data concerning the expanded capabilities that Tablo can now deliver on a single cartridge for up to 24 h. The study evaluated Tablo's performance in a real-world setting, which is particularly valuable as it demonstrates Tablo can successfully deliver adequate renal replacement therapy to critically ill patients, including those with COVID-19 and undergoing ECMO therapy. As COVID-19 surges are likely to continue well into the future [22], these data further support that Tablo therapy prescribed for greater than 12 h can perform treatments with minimal interruptions and decrease the overall burden on nursing staff associated with cartridge changes, complex alarm troubleshooting, and clotted extracorporeal circuits.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Future directions The minimal clotting events and low cartridge usage that were observed are incredibly encouraging, especially in a vulnerable population at increased risk of clotting due to COVID-19 infection [23, 24]. Although not utilized as part of this study, Tablo has the ability to deliver a scheduled saline flush that can automate the delivery of up to 300 mL of saline every 60 min during treatment. While further evidence is needed, prior reports on the use of saline flushes in outpatient intermittent hemodialysis suggests the benefit of reduced clotting during treatment [25, 26]. Additional studies in acute care settings are required to evaluate the effectiveness this feature may have on clotting outcomes and help fill evidence gaps related to anticoagulation strategies in patients requiring prolonged therapies [27].",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"While this study was not set up to determine any specific cost benefits associated with the use of Tablo in the ICU, future trials comparing Tablo's cartridge lifespan to that of filters used in conventional RRT devices are warranted, as higher filter replacement represents a substantial financial burden to hospital systems [15]. This review did not examine circuit lifespan as it relates to COVID-19",1,trial,True,Test

"patients requiring prolonged therapies. A recent study on this population reported a median filter life of only 6.5 h [14], further highlighting the positive results presented here.",1,positive,True,Test
"Limitations While the XTEND trial is the first report of Tablo utilization for greater than 12 h in critically ill patients with key insights into the effectiveness in the acute care setting, there are several limitations to the study. This observational study was not sufficiently powered and involved a small sample size without a control group. Additionally, the treatment success outcomes were subjective and based on assessments made by the clinical expertise of hospital staff. A randomized clinical trial examining multiple, well defined endpoints is needed to appropriately determine the efficacy of Tablo compared to conventional RRT devices. While patient SOFA scores were recorded and assisted in determining acuity, principal diagnosis or primary reason for hospital admission were not included and therefore limit the broader application of these results to a specific AKI population requiring RRT (e.g., sepsis, post-surgical, trauma patients). This also applies to patients admitted to the ICU primarily for COVID-19 complications, as it is possible patients included in this study may have been positive for SARS-CoV-2 upon admission, but not actively experiencing acute COVID viral illness. Furthermore, since the study was conducted at a single center, we are unable to generalize these results. While evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have been published regarding the prescription and delivery of RRT, there is wide variation in treatment implementation amongst institutions [28], which necessitates a larger, multi-center trial to adequately expand upon the findings reported here.",1,trial,True,Test
"Given the above limitations, the results of the XTEND trial support that Tablo is effective in the treatment of critically ill patients in the ICU who require prolonged therapies, including COVID-19 positive patients. The results presented suggest that Tablo's low alarm rates, rapid alarm resolution, minimal blood pump stoppage time and low cartridge usage per 24 h can reduce the overall cost and nursing staff burden traditionally associated with the provision of extended dialytic therapy in the ICU.",1,trial,True,Test

Abstract,0,,False,Test
"Background: Several individual studies from specific countries have reported rising numbers of pediatric COVID19 cases with inconsistent reports on the clinical symptoms including respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms as well as diverse reports on the mean age and household exposure in children. The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in children are not fully understood, hence, comprehensive meta-analyses are needed to provide a better understanding of these characteristics.",1,case,True,Test
"Methods: This review was conducted in Medline, Scopus, Cochrane library, Embase, Web of Science, and published reports on COVID-19 in children. Data were extracted by two independent researchers and a third researcher resolved disputes. STATA software and the random-effect model were used in the synthesis of our data. For each model, the heterogeneity between studies was estimated using the Q Cochrane test. Heterogeneity and publication bias were calculated using the ­I2 statistic and Egger's/Begg's tests.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Results: The qualitative systematic review was performed on 32 articles. Furthermore, the meta-analysis estimated an overall rate of involvement at 12% (95% CI: 9-15%) among children, with an ­I2 of 98.36%. The proportion of household exposure was calculated to be 50.99% (95% CI: 20.80%-80.80%) and the proportion of admitted cases was calculated to be 45% (95% CI: 24%-67%). Additionally, the prevalence of cough, fatigue, fever and dyspnea was calculated to be 25% (95% CI: 0.16-0.36), 9% (95% CI: 0.03-0.18), 33% (95% CI: 0.21-0.47) and 9% (95% CI: 0.04-0.15), respectively. It is estimated that 4% (95% CI: 1-8%) of cases required intensive care unit admission.",1,case,True,Test
"Conclusions: The pediatric clinical picture of COVID-19 is not simply a classic respiratory infection, but unusual presentations have been reported. Given the high incidence of household transmission and atypical clinical presentation in children, we strongly recommend their inclusion in research and population-based preventive measures like vaccination as well as clinical trials to ensure efficacy, safety, and tolerability in this age group.",1,clinical,True,Test

"of organs across the body [1, 2]. An increasing body of research implies that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may significantly contribute to its spread (COVID-19) [3]. SARS-CoV-2 can infect people of all ages and could have long-term consequences for human health. It has a long incubation time, high infectivity, atypical clinical signs, and a significant fatality rate in elderly adults [4, 5]. Although the epidemiology of COVID-19 in adults has been extensively studied, our understanding of the prevalence and consequences of COVID19 in children remains limited. The majority of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 show minimal infection according to an extensive analysis of pediatric cases [6, 7]. Pediatric patients have been suggested as asymptomatic reservoirs of COVID-19 with their burden barely understood due to the mild and asymptomatic nature of the disease [2, 3, 8]. Despite these, few investigations have concentrated on the epidemiological and clinical aspects of pediatric COVID-19 [5].",1,asymptomatic,True,Test
"With current immunization methods focusing mainly on adults, the pediatric population remains vulnerable to COVID-19 infection [9]. Though the unrelenting efforts of scientists have provided the first oral antiviral (Molnupiravir), which has been approved and shows a significant reduction in hospitalization or mortality in mild COVID-19 cases with good safety and tolerability profile in adults, there is little to insufficient data on pediatric cases [10, 11]. Hence, it is critical to be prepared for new waves in terms of pediatric protection and infection control. This could be enhanced by a comprehensive examination of existing pieces of evidence showing illness transmission trends, as well as distinctive and consistent epidemiological aspects of the infection [4, 9, 12].",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Previous studies have reported some unique characteristics in pediatric COVID-19 cases such as lower mortality rate, longer incubation period, and longer respiratory and fecal shedding with high RNA load (83%) [13]. Furthermore, potential comorbidities and coinfections particularly in children, have a critical presentation, with infants younger than 6 months having a substantially higher risk of critical illness [2, 14]. Numerous published articles describe children being infected as part of family clusters [13, 15-21], but limited data exists to appraise the cumulative percentage of household exposures before the diagnosis of COVID-19 in children [4].

Such variations may emanate from differences in study population and location.

However, Zhang C et al. (2020) found no direct evidence in their study regarding the transmission from children to adults [50]. Regardless, the risk of family cluster transmission from asymptomatic children should not be downplayed but be considered in policymaking for epidemic control. Moreover, preventive measures should be observed especially by family clusters of infections.

"COVID-19 cases in children showing a systemic inflammatory syndrome have been reported in at least 8 states in the US (including California, Delaware, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania as well as Washington, D.C.) [54]. Currently, it is not known why children usually show mild to moderate forms of infection and only rarely present with cytokine storm syndrome [55]. Various hypotheses exist like fewer travels, less exposure to people (especially at the beginning of the pandemic), clearer respiratory tracts with better pathogen clearance compared to adults, fewer comorbidities, and strong innate and weaker adaptive immune defenses [56].",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Fever is a prominent sign of both Kawasaki Disease (KD) and COVID-19 infection. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the first differential diagnosis to have in mind in a child with fever is probably COVID-19 infection or its combination. There are a few reports on this subject [57, 58]. KD is a rare disease with an estimated prevalence of 0.10% among children younger than 5 years old [59]. Its diagnosis is very important and missing it could result in complications like Coronary Artery Aneurysms (CAA). The recommendation is to be always suspicious of KD in a febrile child, especially if younger than a year old. If KD is diagnosed, intravenous immunoglobulin treatment should be immediately started, preferably in the first 7 days from the onset of fever [57, 58]. In the published literature only one case of COVID-19 infection in an infant with classic KD signs has been reported, who was discharged with Low-dose Aspirin pending further cardiologic evaluation [57]. Most recently, there have been some worrying reports of a presumed severe COVID-Kawasaki syndrome in the affected children from the US, UK, France, Italy, and Spain [60, 61]. It is believed to be related to poorer outcomes. There have been reports of 33 COVID-Kawasaki syndromes only in New York. Considering the low number of patients under 5 years old affected by COVID-19, the risk of Kawasaki disease likely is enormous. Kawasaki Disease was one of the first diseases where a strong Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) association was found [62]. Hence, this",1,Disease,True,Test
suggests certain HLA-types in children may be more susceptible to severe forms of SARS-COV-2 infection and could be an important clue to the etiology of poor prognosis of COVID-19 in this age group.,1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Limitations of the data We did not have access to certain published papers. Due to insufficient data, we were not able to perform a metaanalysis on some aspects of the disease such as the percentage of children with comorbidities, duration of the incubation period, and some symptoms like abdominal pain. Our investigation did not include laboratory and radiographic findings and we recommend future research into these. Future studies need to be performed on the COVID-Kawasaki syndrome to determine risk factors for poor outcomes in children. There is a possibility of publication bias in some reports, especially for mean age, and we recommend the creation of a global registry on pediatric COVID-19.",1,disease,True,Test
"Future recommendations and vaccination priority in children This investigation described the characteristics of epidemiological characteristics of COVID19 in pediatric patients. Furthermore, the analyzed data from minors under the age of 19 shows that they are less prone to developing severe COVID-19 disease but are equally at risk of contracting the infection. Similar to previous investigations, the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is somewhat different from the adult population. For example, children have longer incubation and shedding periods than adults, an epidemiological phenomenon that places pediatric age groups as potential hosts of the infection and capable of infecting many people. This evidence shows that children might be spreaders of COVID-19 more than we ever thought, and for the pandemic to stop, all children should be involved in mass preventive measures like vaccination programs, social distancing, and masking. In addition, it is encouraged to involve children in various clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines and drugs to generate sufficient safety and efficacy profiles for this age group.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"Introduction: In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, countries have adopted various degrees of restrictive measures on people to reduce COVID-19 transmission. These measures have had significant social and economic costs. In the absence of therapeutics, and low vaccination coverage, strategies for a safe exit plan from a lockdown are required to mitigate the transmission and simultaneously re-open societies. Most countries have outlined or have implemented lockdown exit plans. The objective of this scoping review is to (a) identify and map the different strategies for exit from lockdowns, (b) document the effects of these exit strategies, and (c) discuss features of successful exit strategies based on the evidence.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
Methods: A five-step approach was used in this scoping review: (a) identifying the research question and inclusion/ exclusion criteria; (b) searching the literature using keywords within PubMed and WHO databases; (c) study selection; (d) data extraction; (e) collating results and qualitative synthesis of findings.,0,,False,Test
"Results: Of the 406 unique studies found, 107 were kept for full-text review. Studies suggest the post-peak period as optimal timing for an exit, supplemented by other triggers such as sufficient health system capacity, and increased testing rate. A controlled and step-wise exit plan which is flexible and guided by information from surveillance systems is optimal. Studies recommend continued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical distancing, use of facemasks, and hygiene measures, in different combinations when exiting from a lockdown, even after optimal vaccination coverage has been attained.",1,distancing,True,Test
"Conclusion: Reviewed studies have suggested adopting a multi-pronged strategy consisting of different approaches depending on the context. Among the different exit strategies reviewed (phase-wise exit, hard exit, and constant cyclic patterns of lockdown), phase-wise exit appears to be the optimal exit strategy.",0,,False,Test

"various degrees of population movement restrictions. This has involved closing borders, closing non-essential workplaces and schools, restrictions on gatherings and movements of people (road, air, sea). Some of the mitigation strategies ranged from complete lockdown as seen in India [2] to moderate strategies like in the United Kingdom supported by increased testing, tracing, and quarantining [3]. Other mitigation measures included age-selective distancing. For instance, in New Zealand and South Africa, the older population and those with co-morbidities were recommended to be isolated at",1,tracing,True,Test

"These restrictive measures have significant social and economic consequences, especially in low income, and low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). These measures adversely affected the disadvantaged population as it led to the shutdown of economic activities, loss of employment, disruption in education, challenges in access to essential health services and other public services, including food insecurity [5]. There is, therefore, a need to exit from lockdowns while simultaneously mitigating the COVID-19 transmission. In the absence of therapeutics and a significant vaccination coverage, a situation that is commonly seen in many LMICs, there is a need for strategies for a safe exit from the restriction measures.",1,social,True,Test
"To circumvent the challenges faced following the lockdowns, countries have attempted to devise optimal strategies to exit from lockdowns. Many countries have defined graded exit plans with each phase informed by triggers such as case numbers, infection rate, health system capacity, etc. Other countries have relied on seroprevalence studies and increased testing prior to opening up. The phase-wise exit plans are usually structured by type of business, school, and size of gatherings, etc. The timing and containment measures during exit also varied. Almost all exit strategies studied suggest the continued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs- These include physical distancing, use of face mask, and hygiene measures, and other restrictive measures such as stay at home, school closures, travel restrictions, border closures, and steps to address ventilation measures especially in closed spaces) in various combinations suited to country contexts. Countries such as New Zealand and South Korea began relaxing restrictions only after the number of new daily cases reached almost zero. Austria began implementing its exit plan when the daily caseload fell below 100, so the health system wasn't overwhelmed [4]. However, many countries have opted to open up when transmission rates were falling, but had significant",1,case,True,Test

"The objective of this scoping review is to systematically document the evidence regarding exit strategies related to COVID-19 lockdowns. This scoping review has the following specific aims: (a) to identify and map the different strategies that have been adopted by countries, and are suggested from modelled scenarios of exit from COVID-19 related lockdowns, (b) document the effects of these exit strategies, and (c) discuss features of successful exit strategies based on the available evidence.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Countries are at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. While increasing vaccination coverage is a global goal, many countries have not been able to achieve this due to constraints related to vaccine availability and affordability. With new variants emerging such as Omicron in November 2021, some countries responded with a knee-jerk reaction of imposing travel bans and strict lockdowns [6, 7]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has criticized travel bans, as they affect lives and livelihoods more than the spread of virus [8]. Planning how best to exit from lockdowns is an important policy and public health decision. Depending on the local health system capacity, ongoing calibration of restriction measures is required. There is limited evidence so far on the effects of different exit strategies and findings from this scoping review can guide countries in identifying optimal exit strategies.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"Post peak period reducing number of cases and better health system capacity Two review articles based on global data [9, 10] observe that most countries have opted for opening during the `post-peak period'. In this period, a plateauing of cases and hospital admissions are maintained for 2 weeks, implying that the health system can cater to the cases without a crisis. However, this approach risks the formation of new clusters, triggering the next wave of the pandemic, as most of the population is likely not exposed yet to the virus. A strong surveillance system to classify the epidemiological situation is required during the post-peak period. Petersen et al.

"[4] has summarized various triggers to determine the timing for exiting from lockdowns such as (a) health system capacity (number of beds, equipment available), (b) health system demand (e.g. ICU admissions), (c) death rate (e.g. New York's plan to ease restrictions after 14days continuous fall in death rate), (d) mode of transmission (New Zealand's plan explicitly relates easing levels with change in the mode of transmission- to households only), and (e) costbenefit analysis. Cuschieri [11] has described Malta's experience of reopening from the COVID-19 lockdown where the government considered gradual relaxation of lockdown when the `Reproduction number' (R- The effective reproductive number is the average number of secondary cases per infectious case in a population made up of both susceptible and non-susceptible hosts. If R>1, the number of cases will increase, such as at the start of an epidemic, and where R<1 there will be a decline in the number of cases [12])' went below one. Raje et al.

Early relaxation of NPIs before sufficient immunity has been achieved can lead to a larger wave of infection. Furthermore, the study adds vaccination alone cannot bring R below one, and control the epidemic. As per the modelling exercises, with assumptions of vaccine offering 85% protection against the infection and vaccine uptake above 75%, R would reduce to 1.58, which is still greater than the required value of below one.

The exposure levels of household contacts/ contact with confirmed cases, exposure of border security forces, airport staff, health workers, and front-line workers should all be categorised in terms of high, medium, low, and no identifiable risk.

This would prevent the health system from being overwhelmed. Determinants such as reduction in the reproduction number, a smaller susceptible population, considerations for the economy, livelihoods, and health system capacity are additional considerations before opening up. This corresponds to the WHO recommendation [97] to undertake a situational assessment of the intensity of transmission and health system capacity, before deciding to lift restrictive measures.

"in health establishments. For international travellers coming from countries with an active outbreak, strict quarantine rules should continue. Strengthening the public health system for detection, tracing, and quarantine should continue till vaccine coverage improves.",1,outbreak,True,Test
"Adopting a multi-pronged strategy consisting of these different approaches as per the context is recommended by most studies we reviewed. In the highincome countries, there is a relatively larger proportion of formal sector workers and better health system capacity. Here, we note a reliance on increased testing capacity, and better surveillance to aid the phase-wise opening. In the low-and-middle-income countries, while the principles for opening up remain the same, studies have additionally suggested zonal lockdowns, local and context-specific identification of high-risk places and vulnerable individuals, and more adherence to non-pharmaceutical measures.",1,,True,Test
"This scoping review has a few limitations. First, only two databases were included in the search strategy, likely missing out on other published evidence. However, we expect to have covered the majority of published studies. Second, the review has included studies on the effects of exit strategies on COVID19 related outcomes. Effects on other outcomes such as social and economic aspects were not included. Effects of vaccination coverage on opening up weren't studied as literature on this was in early stages while undertaking the review. Recent literature does point to significant effects of existing COVID vaccines on reducing disease severity (hospitalization and deaths) [99], and on newer variants such as Omicron [100]. Improving vaccination coverage thus becomes an important component of exit strategy. However, due to global vaccine divide, `vaccination' may not be a feasible strategy for many countries at the moment. Further research needs to be undertaken to understand effects of vaccines on exiting from lockdowns in different contexts.",1,social,True,Test
"Conclusion Different approaches for exit strategies have been adopted by countries or suggested via modelling exercises in the review findings. These vary from imposing a phase-wise exit to a hard exit. Other strategies which consider vaccination coverage include constant partial lockdowns or a cyclic strategy for lockdown and relaxation till optimum immunity is achieved. Out of these, the phase-wise exit with continuation of non-pharmaceutical interventions appears to be optimal, as per the review findings.",0,,False,Test

"Background: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection occurring in RT-PCR negative individuals represent a poorly characterized cohort with important infection control connotations. While household and community-based studies have evaluated seroprevalence of antibody and transmission dynamics in this group, workplace-based data is currently unavailable. Methods: A cohort study was carried out in July 2021, during and immediately following the peak of the 3­ rd wave of COVID-19 in Sri Lanka, prior to mass vaccination. A total of 92 unvaccinated individuals between the ages of 17-65 years were purposively sampled from an office and two factory settings. The selected cohort that had been exposed to RT-PCR positive cases in the workplace was tested RT-PCR negative. Serological samples collected six weeks post exposure were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody.",1,Asymptomatic,True,Test
"Results: The seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies in the overall cohort was 63.04% (58/92). Seroprevalences in the office setting, factory setting 1 and factory setting 2 were 69.2% (9/13), 55.7% (34/61) and 83.33% (15/18), respectively. Primary risk factor associated with seropositivity was face to face contact with no mask for>15 min (p<0.024, Odds Ratio (OR); 5.58, 95%CI;1.292- 25.65). Individuals with workspace exposure had significantly higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than those who did not (percentage neutralization in assay 63.3% (SD:21)vs 45.7% (SD:20), p,""0.0042), as did individuals who engaged socially without protective measures (62.4 (SD:21.6)% vs 49.7 (SD:21)%, p"",0.026).",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
Conclusion: There was a high seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies among RT-PCR negative contacts in workplace settings in Sri Lanka. Higher levels of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection than estimated based on RT-PCR positive contact data indicate need for targeted infection control measures in these settings during future outbreaks.,1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test

"October 2020 with only 3396 cases, 13 deaths, and a low case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.38, following strict lockdown measures. The second wave, from October 2020 to April 2021 gave rise to 92,341 cases and 591 deaths with a case fatality rate of 0.64. Lockdown measures, case isolation and contact tracing were extensively performed. The third wave starting in April 2021 gave rise to a national health and socio-economic crisis with 445,336 new cases, 13,139 deaths and a high case fatality rate of 2.95, with the delta variant (B.1.617.2) being the dominant viral strain responsible for the high transmission and increased death rates [2, 3]. Restricted movement directives were in place; however, allowance was made for maintenance of agriculture, essential services and export production for economic reasons. While social interaction among the population was minimal during this time, work-based interaction in some sectors continued due to economic needs.

Apart from COVID-19, history reveals that industrial settings carry a high risk of rapid transmission of airborne infectious diseases such as TB [15] and influenza [16] due to risk of close proximity of individuals, high population density, poor ventilation and longer working hours.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"Study population The study was conducted during July 2021, during and immediately following the peak of the ­3rd wave of COVID-19, which was the major outbreak in Sri Lanka, immediately before the national COVID-19 vaccine rollout. A total of 92 unvaccinated individuals between the ages of 17-65 years working in three institutions; two factory settings (factory-1 and factory-2) and an office setting (office-1) were purposively recruited for the study with informed written consent. The selected individuals had been exposed to RT-PCR positive individuals in the workplace and had been screened during routine community-based, government mandated screening, for COVID-19 at the appropriate time following exposure by RT-PCR and confirmed as negative. RT-PCR for all samples had been performed at the National Hospital Kandy Virology laboratory on nasopharyngeal swabs collected as part of the national community screening and diagnostic programme run by the Provincial and Regional Directorate of Health Services. RT-PCR was performed using the RealStar SARS-CoV RT-PCR kit which used gene targets E gene (CoV specific) and S gene (SARS CoV specific) for diagnosis. Samples with both target gene amplification (Ct<40) with valid controls were considered positive. Samples with both target genes negative with valid controls, were considered negative. Blood sample collection for serological testing for this study was done approximately 4-6 weeks from known exposure to detect maximum antibody responses.

"population seroprevalence was approximately 4.5%, a wide variation existed in specific populations, with a high 59% prevalence in persons in assisted living and long term care facilities [21]. Seroprevalence was also higher in people aged 18-64 compared to over 65 (RR1.27, 95% CI 1.11- 1.45). These findings indicate that higher seroprevalence can be expected in working age individuals in high population density settings consistent with virus transmission dynamics. Given that our data represents seroprevalence at a later (mid 2021) stage of the pandemic in workplace settings where deficiencies in infection control would have occurred, the seroprevalence we have found appears reasonable, though disturbingly high. In addition to seroprevalence we show that neutralizing antibody levels are also higher in the densely populated factory settings compared to the office setting indicating that the level of exposure may have an impact on the strength of the humoral immune response even in asymptomatic infection.",1,transmission,True,Test
"To the best of our knowledge, this is the only study to evaluate the level of neutralizing antibodies in RTPCR negative contacts. Therefore, comparison of these results in either community or workplace settings is not possible. However, comparison with results from two studies carried out in Sri Lanka, utilizing the same surrogate viral neutralization assay in symptomatic and vaccinated populations show that, the mean antibody level in our study cohort (mean antibody level:59.38% 95%, CI: 53.61- 65.16) was similar to that reached with symptomatic infection prior to vaccination (median antibody level: 63.2%, IQR: 9.9- 95.2%) [22] or with single dose vaccination (median antibody level: 69.42%, IQR: 54.0981.54% [23] though the statistical significance of these results cannot be tested at this time. These findings suggest that exposure, particularly exposure in confined settings like factory 1 (mean antibody level: 68.50% (95% CI: 62.02-74.97), can result in significant immune responses, despite being both asymptomatic and RT-PCR negative.",1,negative,True,Test
"Among evaluated risk factors, the only identified risk factor for seropositivity was having face to face contact with no mask for>15 min. Sample size limitation may have impacted these findings. A study carried out in China demonstrated that transmission among household cases was associated with exposure to multiple cases, face to face communication with an index case for 30 min or longer and sharing a vehicle with an index case. However, no independent association was observed between SARS-CoV-2 transmission and either indirect contact, meal sharing, and lavatory co-usage [14]. A similar study carried out in South Korea showed face-to-face conversations, eating together, and using the same toilet with COVID-19 patient, were significantly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection and sharing objects with SARS-CoV-2 infected persons was not associated with",1,contact,True,Test
"acquiring the infection. Moreover, face-to-face conversations with a COVID-19 infected individual was revealed to be an independent risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 transmission (OR: 4.11) [13]. These studies strongly corroborate our findings. In addition, we show that although the evaluated risk factors of workspace exposure, and exposure without protective measures during socializing/ eating did not reach statistical significance for simple seropositivity, such exposure showed higher levels of neutralizing antibodies. These findings also support the likelihood that increased level of exposure is associated with increased humoral antibody response even in asymptomatic infection. This is the first-time neutralizing antibody level has been evaluated in relation to exposure risk factors. This evidence strongly supports the recommendations to reduce COVID-19 transmission, presented by the Three Cs Strategy of WHO (avoid i. crowded places ii. close-contact settings iii. confined and enclosed spaces) and the CDC, which encourage the public to wear face masks, maintain physical distance from other persons, limit in-person contacts, avoid nonessential indoor spaces, protect essential workers by providing adequate personal protective equipment, follow safe work practices and to increase air ventilation and environmental disinfection in the workspace [24].",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Male: female ratio in office-1, factory-1 and factory-2 were 9:4, 8:53 and 1:2 respectively. Demographic characteristics such as gender and education level were found to be associated with increasing the risk behavior for potential exposure for COVID-19. Females were more likely to eat and socialize together with no protective measures while males were tended to share items at meals/clothing/other. More educated population who had completed their studies beyond GCE O/L seemed to be sharing items/ meals/clothing/other and maintaining face to face contact with no mask for>15 min than the less educated population. These results highlight the socio-cultural differences in habits that need to be specifically addressed if consistent changes in behavior are to be brought about and that possibly health literacy is more important than formal education in preventing COVID-19. Gender based differences in attitudes towards pandemic restrictions have been consistently shown over 8 countries with females being more likely to agree and comply with restrictions on behavior [25]. Here we show that certain behavior patterns in some communal settings do not conform to largescale evaluations. Investigation of ingrained etiquette in a given setting and addressing these at a ground level are likely to be necessary for good infection control practice in individual institutions.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"higher likelihood of risk behavior seen in the PCR positive group was the reason they became infected. However, it is also possible and indeed more likely that the PCR negative participants were hesitant to reveal their true exposure history, possibly due to fear of repercussions from the workplace administration for not following guidelines issued by the government to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the level of stigma at that point of time in the society and not having psychological safety to reveal the truth may have discouraged them from revealing pertinent facts related to their exposure history. Therefore, underestimation of risk behavior is likely. This is another area that needs to be addressed when improving infection control by creating a non-threatening environment, which empowers employees to understand and report risk behaviors.",1,positive,True,Test
"The primary strength of this study is that it is the only data currently available showing evidence of transmission in RT-PCR negative contacts in workplace settings. In addition to seropositivity, the added dimension of level of neutralizing antibodies and the association of exposure factors to both give new insights into the relationship between exposure and induced immunity. The main weakness it the small sample size due to practical restrictions, which limited the number of tests we could perform at each study site. Increasing both the number of samples as well as study sites would have provided a clearer picture of transmission dynamics in different workplace settings,",1,transmission,True,Test
"Collectively our findings indicate high levels of SARSCoV-2 transmission occur in workplaces, and these individuals are not included in the total case count of a country or region unless seroprevalence studies are performed. This has several implications. First, the total number of COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka is likely to be much higher than current estimates. The corollary of which is that the true case fatality rate for Sri Lanka during the ­3rd wave is likely lower than 2.55%, which is above the global average (1.7%). Second, while workplaces, particularly industrial settings were kept functional during the lockdowns to maintain economic solvency, there was inadequate preparation of the workplaces and the employees for infection control. Third, the subsequent vaccine rollout that covered the working population has resulted in higher levels of immunity than just the twodose regime would give as many workers in industrial settings are likely to already have seroconverted despite negative PCR results. The subsequent 4­ th wave of infection by the delta and omicron variants and the current ­3rd dose deployment island wide mean that fairly high antibody levels can be expected in this population. This is good news for subsequent waves with new variants as high levels of at least partially neutralizing antibodies can be expected in the workforce.",1,transmission,True,Test
Further work exploring the adequacy of infection control measures and adherence to country and company policy in ground level workplaces is needed especially to flatten the curve until the effect of vaccine role out is gained. COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic we face. The need of developing economies running without being damaged by prolonged lockdowns highlights the need for policy and structural changes that ensure continuous functioning of workplaces.,1,curve,True,Test
"Conclusion There was a high seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies in the workplace setting in Sri Lanka in asymptomatic, RT-PCR negative contacts.

Abstract,0,,False,Test
"Background: Steroids have been shown to reduce inflammation, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) and lung edema. Based on evidence from clinical trials, steroids are widely used in severe COVID-19. However, the effects of steroids on pulmonary gas volume and blood volume in this group of patients are unexplored.",1,clinical,True,Test
"Objective: Profiting by dual-energy computed tomography (DECT), we investigated the relationship between the use of steroids in COVID-19 and distribution of blood volume as an index of impaired HPV. We also investigated whether the use of steroids influences lung weight, as index of lung edema, and how it affects gas distribution.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Methods: Severe COVID-19 patients included in a single-center prospective observational study at the intensive care unit at Uppsala University Hospital who had undergone DECT were enrolled in the current study. Patients' cohort was divided into two groups depending on the administration of steroids. From each patient's DECT, 20 gas volume maps and the corresponding 20 blood volume maps, evenly distributed along the cranial-caudal axis, were analyzed. As a proxy for HPV, pulmonary blood volume distribution was analyzed in both the whole lung and the hypoinflated areas. Total lung weight, index of lung edema, was estimated.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Results: Sixty patients were analyzed, whereof 43 received steroids. Patients not exposed to steroids showed a more extensive non-perfused area (19% vs 13%, p<0.01) and less homogeneous pulmonary blood volume of hypoinflated areas (kurtosis: 1.91 vs 2.69, p<0.01), suggesting a preserved HPV compared to patients treated with steroids. Moreover, patients exposed to steroids showed a significantly lower lung weight (953 gr vs 1140 gr, p,""0.01). A reduction in alveolar-arterial difference of oxygen followed the treatment with steroids (322±106 mmHg at admission vs 267±99 mmHg at DECT, p"",0.04).",1,area,True,Test
"Conclusions: The use of steroids might cause impaired HPV and might reduce lung edema in severe COVID-19. This is consistent with previous findings in other diseases. Moreover, a reduced lung weight, as index of decreased lung edema, and a more homogeneous distribution of gas within the lung were shown in patients treated with steroids.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

However, despite the prompt recognition of the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 on different organs and functions [6], the pathophysiological mechanisms affecting the respiratory function still remain to be thoroughly understood. This difficulty derives from the fact that the primary function of the respiratory system, i.e., the gas exchange, is based on the interplay of two different sub-systems [7], alveolar ventilation and pulmonary capillary perfusion that deal with different physiological mechanisms and are associated with different structural features.",1,disease,True,Test
"Numerous drugs have been tested as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents [8]. Among them, steroids (i.e., dexamethasone 6 mg for 10 days) have been demonstrated to improve survival [9, 10] and are therefore widely used in severe COVID-19. Despite their effectiveness and well-known pleiotropic effects [11], the pharmacodynamics of steroids on COVID-19 lungs have not yet been widely reported. Based on the previous literature, a steroidinduced dysregulation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) [12, 13] as well as a reduction in lung edema [14] can be hypothesized to occur in COVID-19 patients.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test

The study was approved by the National Ethical Review Agency (EPM; No. 2020-01623) and performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent revisions. Patients older than 18 years with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV2 on nasal swab specimen and available chest DECT performed during the intensive care stay were analyzed. All patients were not vaccinated for SARS-CoV2. The scans were acquired on clinical indication in static lung conditions, covering the whole lung parenchyma in supine position (see Fig. 1). Comprehensive clinical data were collected at ICU admission and the day of DECT. A subgroup analysis was conducted, dividing the sampled population in two groups: the group of patients not treated with steroids (No-Steroids group) and the one treated with steroids (Steroids group). In June 2020, the early report of the RECOVERY dexamethasone trial [9, 10] was published and the treatment guidelines of the disease were changed accordingly. Consequently, all patients recruited after June 16, 2020, were treated with steroids, forming up the group labeled ""Steroids."" Patients chronically treated with steroids for reasons different from COVID-19 but that received, during their ICU stay, a steroids dose comparable to or higher than Dexamethasone 6 mg/day were included in the Steroids group.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"DECT image analysis Dual-energy computed tomography was always performed in supine position. For each raw DECT dataset, routine material-specific DECT maps were generated using a secondary workstation (Syngo.via Multimodality Workplace; Siemens Medical Solutions) that applied a three-material decomposition algorithm [18]. Two different series of images were selected and used for further analysis: the gas distribution (pulmonary gas volume) maps and the corresponding blood distribution (pulmonary blood volume) maps (see Fig. 1). Twenty images evenly spaced along the cranial-caudal axis and located between the apex and the diaphragmatic dome were analyzed (see Fig. 1). A manual segmentation of the lung parenchyma was applied, and big vessels, heart and mediastinal structures were excluded from the subsequent analysis. As regard to the pulmonary gas volume maps, the Hounsfield units (HU) range of - 1000 (gas) to+100 (non-aerated lung) was considered, as done in previous studies (see Fig. 2). Four lung compartments were then defined [19]: hyperinflated (- 1000 to - 800 HU), normoinflated (- 800 to - 500 HU), poorly inflated (- 500 to - 100 HU) and non-inflated (- 100 to+100 HU) lung.

"maps, we studied the range between - 100 and+150 HU (see Fig. 2). Based on previous studies [20-22], zero HU was set as a limit between non-perfused (HU0) and perfused lung compartment (HU>0). Each compartment was separately computed and expressed as c­ m2 and as percentage of the total lung volume in each map [22]. From the bell-shaped curves characterizing the HU distribution of perfused blood volume maps, kurtosis was calculated as measure of both dispersion and morphology of the curves (see Fig. 3A) as done in previous studies [23-26]. Kurtosis belongs to the big chapter of the measures of variance, and it is commonly used to quantify both dispersion and morphology of density histograms derived from computed tomography images. A reduced kurtosis corresponds to a decreased homogeneity of pulmonary blood volume. The latter has been previously interpreted as indirect index of HPV efficiency [27]: a low homogeneity of pulmonary blood volume (low kurtosis) corresponding to a preserved HPV. To further assess the relation between and HPV, where a reduced pulmonary blood volume is expected in the hypoinflated lung, pulmonary blood volume was separately assessed for the whole lung and for the hypoinflated areas, the latter characterized by poorly inflated and non-inflated lung",1,curve,True,Test

"Study population Sixty patients affected by severe COVID-19 and in need of intensive care were analyzed in the study (see Table 1). The mean age was of 63±9 years and 20% were women. At ICU admission, the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to inspired oxygen fraction at the day of the DECT was 127±46 mmHg and the SAPS3 was 51±9. During their ICU stay before DECT, 41% of patients were intubated and 22% experienced an acute thrombotic event. In this selected population, the 30-day mortality was 29%. Forty-three out of sixty patients (72%) received steroids as treatment of COVID-19-associated pneumonia (Dexamethasone 6 mg for 10 days) [9, 10]. In order to compare the severity of the disease in No-Steroid and Steroid patients, we analyzed a wide selection of clinical and biochemical markers (see Table 2).

"Discussion To date, despite established evidence of a reduced mortality in severe COVID-19 patients treated with steroids compared to a control population [9, 10], no studies investigated the effects of steroids on the lungs in this patients' population. In the current study, for the first time, we introduced the use of dual-energy computed tomography to study the effects of steroids on lung ventilation and perfusion as well as on lung weight in patients affected by severe COVID-19 and in need of intensive care. The main findings of the current study can be summarized as follows: (1) the use of steroids is associated with a high kurtosis of lung perfusion in the hypoventilated regions of the lung. This suggests that steroids might counteract hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction; (2) steroids reduced lung weight, possibly originated by a decreased edema; (3) steroids improve regional gas distribution; (4) despite potential effects on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, gas change was improved as evidenced by a reduction in AaDO2, suggesting that the effects of steroids to reduced edema and improve gas distribution predominated.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"In clinical contexts different from COVID-19, as highaltitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), steroids have been demonstrated to reduce pulmonary arterial systolic pressure, presumably counteracting hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction [12, 13].

Thereby, HPV optimizes ventilation/perfusion match and improves oxygen delivery [38, 39]. A dysregulated HPV has been hypothesized in ARDS [40] and COVID-19 patients [15, 41]. The current study was neither designed to directly investigate the mechanisms of action of steroids on HPV in COVID-19 patients nor planned to grade the HPV derangement induced by COVID-19. However, our data suggest that in patients affected by severe COVID-19 the use of steroids might jeopardize HPV (see Figs. 4, 5 and Additional file 2: Table E2). A damped HPV is apparently not in line with the known beneficial effects of steroids observed in severe COVID-19 patients [9, 42]. However, this",1,COVID-19,True,Test

Moreover, other concomitant beneficial mechanisms induced by steroids as anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, as well as the reduction in lung edema, demonstrated in this study, might also compensate for a worsened HPV and an exacerbated ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Although HPV is the primary active mechanism influencing regional lung perfusion, other concomitant factors can have a role. Among others, superinfections by Gram-negative bacteria, potentially less hindered in patients treated with steroids, could possibly attenuate HPV [45]. At the same time, direct mechanical effects as well as undefined intracellular signaling can be listed among nonhypoxia-related mechanisms affecting regional lung perfusion [46, 47].",1,clinical,True,Test

"to the ICU were treated with steroids (Steroids group) as a consequence of a change of treatment guidelines. The fact that steroids have been introduced at a specific time of the pandemic might introduce a chronology bias into the study. As a matter of fact, the SARS-CoV2 pandemic during its course has been characterized by a continuous change of treatment strategies and clinical routines that affect the generalizability of many studies on COVID-19. However, in our study, all the recruited patients were not vaccinated for SARS-CoV2, they were all affected by the same SARS-CoV2 variant (the original Wuhan variant) and, in the studied time lapse, there were not concomitant antiviral/anti-inflammatory treatments specific to COVID-19 other than steroids. Given the demonstrated positive effects of steroids and their routine use in severe COVID-19 patients [9], a prospective study comparing patients exposed or not exposed to steroids would have entailed unsolvable ethical issues. Given the design of the study, the direct causality between steroids and a deranged HPV could not be directly investigated. We did not directly study how steroids influence the pathophysiological mechanisms of HPV. Moreover, a deranged HPV is not the only factor interfering with the regional distribution of perfused blood volume, e.g., pulmonary thrombotic events, lung heterogeneity or interstitial edema are concomitant causes also affecting blood distribution and shunt. However, of all factors potentially aggravating shunt, HPV is the only one influencing, in a targeted manner, hypo-/non-inflated lung regions. The DECT scanner does not reach the resolution necessary to observe the behavior of single capillaries. For this reason, the attenuation value of one voxel portrayed the behavior of many alveoli and of the complex mesh of capillary vessels surrounding them. In this respect, the choice of focusing the analysis to the subpopulation of voxels subtending hypo- or non-inflated areas reduces the possible error deriving from the mechanical interaction between the inflated alveoli and the neighboring capillary units, being them in a similar inflation status. Although intriguing and supported by indirect evidences (i.e., lung imaging), the hypothesized parallelism between the mechanisms of action of steroids in HAPE and COVID19 needs further investigations [51]. Steroids have pleiotropic effects [11] and the current study investigated only some possible consequences of pharmacodynamic mechanisms characterizing steroids. Chest DECT provides static information about gas volume at one predefined moment. Pulmonary gas volume maps are widely used in the literature to infer ventilation distribution [19]. The same applies to DECT pulmonary blood volume maps [52]. DECT generates images describing blood volume distribution within the lung at one single time point: For this reason, these images should only be indirectly and",1,pandemic,True,Test

"Conclusions Chest DECT can provide unique functional information and visualize the effects of pharmacodynamic mechanisms of drugs on lung parenchyma. Taking advantage of chest DECT, we show changes in pulmonary gas volume and blood volume that might stand for an association between the use of steroids and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in severe COVID-19 patients in need of intensive care. Steroids can influence ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Moreover, treatment with steroids is associated with a reduced lung edema and consequently improves regional distribution of gas volume within the lungs of severe COVID-19 patients.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). e increasing prevalence rate of the virus nearly devastated healthcare systems across the world [1, 2]. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease a global health pandemic. It is transmitted through inhalation of respiratory droplets from an infectious person emitted through sneezing, coughing, and having a close conversation, as well as contact with contaminated surfaces [3]. e infection prominently a ects the respiratory tract. e initial COVID-19 symptoms are fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Other symptoms include body aches and pains, a sore throat, diarrhoea, headache, loss of taste and smell, breathing di culties, skin rash, and discoloration of the",1,COVID-19,True,Test
ngers and toes [3]. COVID-19 morbidity and mortality can be compounded,1,COVID-19,True,Test
"by pre-existing diseases such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cancer, infectious diseases, and substance abuse. Furthermore, pre-existing conditions such as environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic factors may in uence the COVID-19 incidence rate [4]. To prevent and",1,disease,True,Test
"control the spread of COVID-19, health providers and governments around the world implemented containment measures such as lockdowns, travel bans, cessation of movement, social distancing, proper hygiene, and proper hand washing, among others. Despite these safeguards, the virus continues to spread, although at a slow rate.",1,spread,True,Test
"Vaccination has been a major public health tool in modern medicine used to minimize the impact of many infectious diseases on humans [5, 6]. A vaccine is any biologically derived substance that elicits a protective immune response when administered to a susceptible host. Vaccines help the body to prepare for disease by taking the advantage of the fact that immunity knows how to defend against infectious organisms, which are typically viruses, bacteria, or toxins [7]. Given the emergence of highly transmissible new variants, decreased vaccine e ectiveness, and unequal vaccine availability, there is a growing concern that vaccination may not result in herd immunity. Vaccines reduce the risk of severe disease and death; therefore, a country's vaccine coverage must be high in order to protect the healthcare system from an infection surge [2]. Since late 2020, several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that are more transmissible and/or vaccine-resistant have been identi ed [8].",1,infectious,True,Test

"In modern medicine, vaccination has been an important public health technique for reducing the burden of many human infectious diseases [5, 6, 9]. Several COVID-19 vaccine candidates have been developed and are already in use [10]. Vaccines such as Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sputnik, Sinopharm, Johnson & Johnson, and many others are currently being administered around the world to date. It is a social responsibility choice of an individual to get vaccinated. However, offsetting the fear and adverse side effects of the vaccine has to be carried out[11]. e shortage of supply of COVID-19 vaccines in many developing countries has resulted in the implementation of different immunization strategies, with varying results. For example, in Kenya, prioritization is given to the adult population [2].",1,infectious,True,Test
"A mathematical model provides insight into infectious disease transmission and control [12, 13]. Many mathematical models on the dynamics of COVID-19 with control strategies have been developed and studied, for example, in studies carried out in [9, 10]. Optimal control is regarded as a powerful mathematical tool for optimizing control problems in various fields [14-18]. In the context of vaccination, the dynamics of disease transmission and immunity in a population are typically modelled by using network compartmental approaches [19]. A mathematical model for the dynamics of COVID-19 is presented in [18]. An optimal control function is added to the model in order to effectively control the outbreak. e main controls are isolation, quarantine, and hospitalization. e result shows that adopting the available control measures to their full potential will greatly reduce infectious populations.",1,infectious,True,Test
"A new COVID-19 model with an optimal control analysis is presented in [20]. e authors considered four different controls to develop an optimal control model, including prevention, vaccination control, rapid screening of people who are exposed, and people who are infected without screening. e forward-backward Runge-Kutta method is used to resolve the model with and without control. e findings suggest that control can be useful for reducing infected individuals and improving population health. A novel fractional-order mathematical model that explains the behaviour of COVID-19 in Ethiopia is developed and analyzed in [21]. An inexact Newton iterative method is used to solve the model system. e model considers the impact of various control techniques on disease transmission.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Zamir et al. in [22] developed a mathematical model to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. e study used a nonclinical approach to investigate optimal control. A COVID-19 mathematical model that takes into account the susceptible, exposed, infected, asymptotic, quarantine/isolation, and recovered classes is developed and analyzed in [23]. Elasticity and sensitivity analysis shows that the model is more sensitive to transmission rates from infected to exposed classes than transmission rates from susceptible to exposed classes.",1,transmission,True,Test

"Abstract-- Masks are used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to limit transmission and save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research about the impact of maskwearing in the COVID-19 pandemic has raised formidable interest across multiple disciplines. In this paper, we investigate the impact of mask-wearing in spreading processes over complex networks. This is done by studying a heterogeneous bond percolation process over a multi-type network model, where nodes can be one of two types (mask-wearing, and not-maskwearing). We provide analytical results that accurately predict the expected epidemic size and probability of emergence as functions of the characteristics of the spreading process (e.g., transmission probabilities, inward and outward efficiency of the masks, etc.), the proportion of mask-wearers in the population, and the structure of the underlying contact network. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we also conduct extensive simulations on random networks. We also comment on the analogy between the mask-model studied here and the multiple-strain viral spreading model with mutations studied recently by Eletreby et al.",1,Mask,True,Test
I. INTRODUCTION,0,,False,Test
"The rapid spread of COVID-19 has devastated the world since its inception in December 2019, leading to global economic crises and claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. As schools and businesses reopen, it is of paramount importance to asses how various safety measures may limit the spread of COVID-19. One such measure is mask-wearing, which is known to reduce the transmissibility of viruses that spread through respiratory droplets. Much of the existing work surrounding the effectiveness of mask-wearing have studied how it limits transmission between individuals [11], [9]. However, several questions remain regarding the health of the general public. How many people must wear masks to significantly curb the spread of COVID-19? More generally, how does mask-wearing change the spreading dynamics of an epidemic?",1,spread,True,Test
"In this paper, we provide quantitative answers to the questions above. To do so, we consider a natural generalization of the commonly-used Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model on networks in which some individuals wear masks while others do not. We allow for different probabilities of transmission between mask-wearers and non-mask-wearers, so that an individual wearing a mask is less likely to be infected. We refer to this model as the mask model. For networks with a given degree distribution, we provide",1,mask,True,Test

"analytical methods to accurately predict the total number of infected individuals of each type (mask-wearing and nonmask-wearing) as well as the probability that an epidemic will emerge. Technically, this is achieved by adapting techniques developed by Alexander and Day [2] as well as Eletreby, Zhuang, Carley, Yagan and Poor [8], which were used to study a multi-strain model with mutation. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to illustrate how mask-wearing can impact the spread of an epidemic.",1,mask,True,Test
A. Related Work,0,,False,Test
"Classical models of epidemics use a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the fraction of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals within the population (see for instance [5]). Prior models which incorporate the effects of mask-wearing have modified the basic ODE model in various ways. Brienen et al [6] considered a simple modification in which the reproductive number of the virus, R0, is reduced by a multiplicative factor based on the efficacy of masks. Subsequently, Tracht et al [17] as well as Eikenberry et al [7] considered more complex generalizations of the basic ODE model in which mask-wearers and nonmask-wearers have different transmissibilities and maskwearers become non-mask-wearers at some rate, as well as vice versa. While ODE-based models are relatively simple to simulate and analyze, they are only mathematically justified under the unrealistic assumption that an infected individual can transmit the virus to any other susceptible individual in the population, regardless of location or other factors.",1,epidemic,True,Test
"Our approach, on the other hand, falls under the class of network epidemic models. These models take an individuallevel view of viral spread, and studies how the structure of the contact network influences the epidemic. This provides much finer information about the epidemic, but is costly to simulate, spurring a large body of work devoted to deriving analytical predictions of epidemiological properties [15], [14], [12]. In particular, our work is closely related to literature on heterogenous bond percolation [3], [10] and a multiple-strain model with mutations [2], [8]. We elaborate on these connections in later sections.",1,epidemic,True,Test
II. EPIDEMIC MODELS,0,,False,Test
The most basic model of network epidemics was studied by Newman [15]; we briefly review his setup in order to provide context for the more complex models we consider,1,epidemic,True,Test
"in this paper. Given a prescribed degree distribution (for instance Poisson or Power law), a random contact network is generated via the configuration model [13], [4], [16]. Initially, a single individual (patient zero) is infected with the virus, and each neighbor of patient zero becomes infected with probability T , where T is referred to as the transmissibility of the virus. Patient zero then recovers and is no longer susceptible. The process continues as each newlyinfected vertex attempts to infect their susceptible neighbors in the same manner. The process terminates when there are no more susceptible vertices in the population.",1,contact,True,Test
A. Single-strain propagation with masks,1,mask,True,Test
"To account for the effects of mask-wearing on viral spread, we make the following modifications to Newman's model. First, we specify m  [0, 1] to be the expected fraction of individuals who wear a mask. Formally, we assign each vertex in the contact network a mask with probability m and no mask with probability 1 - m. This is done independently for each vertex. Second, we assume that the transmissibilities are heterogenous: the probability that individual u infects individual v depends on whether u and v are wearing masks. We say that a vertex is of type 1 if they wear a mask and type 2 if they do not wear a mask. We then have four parameters describing the transmissibility of the virus: T11, T12, T21 and T22. The parameter T11 is the transmissibility when u and v both wear masks, T12 is the transmissibility when u wears a mask and v does not, etc. For brevity, we refer to this model as the Mask Model. This type of model is sometimes called heterogenous bond percolation over multi-type networks. We remark that while Allard et al [3] consider such a model in full generality, an important contribution of this paper is to study in detail the important case of mask-wearing. After the initial submission of our paper in September 2020, Lee and Zhu [10] studied the same Mask Model we propose here and derived the epidemic threshold and expected epidemic size using similar techniques as Allard et al. Here, using different techniques we additionally characterize the probability of emergence and provide extensive simulations to support our results.",1,mask,True,Test

Formally, the probability that strain i mutates into strain j within a host is given by µij.",0,,False,Test
"We next describe a mapping between the Mask Model and the multi-strain model with mutation. The key insight is that in expectation, a mask-wearing individual will have a different effective transmissibility than a non-mask-wearing individual.

There seems to be a good alignment between the two curves close to the critical threshold, but the two predictions diverge for larger mean degrees. We give a possible reason for this mismatch. In the mask model, there is a single strain in the population and a susceptible vertex is infected as long as as there is a successful infection by at least one neighbor. In the multi-strain model with mutation, if there are multiple successful infections to a susceptible vertex, the resulting transmitted strain depends on the number of successful infections of each type.

Interestingly, we see that the fraction of infected non-mask-wearers (shown in blue) is also monotonically decreasing in m.

Curiously, the fraction of infected mask-wearers is not monotonically decreasing in m; the infection curve peaks at m ,"" 0.6. We provide a possible explanation. There are two opposing effects which influence the number of infected mask-wearers. As m increases, the total number of infected mask-wearers will naturally increase, since there are more susceptible mask-wearers in the population. On the other hand, increasing m will also decrease the transmissibility of the virus, leading to a lower rate of infection. When m < 0.6, the first effect dominates: the increase in susceptible maskwearers is greater than the decrease in transmissibility.

"The serial interval and effective reproduction number for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are heterogenous, varying by demographic characteristics, region, and period. During February 1-July 13, 2020, we identified 4,080 transmission pairs in Georgia, USA, by using contact tracing information from COVID-19 cases reported to the Georgia Department of Public Health. We examined how various transmission characteristics were affected by symptoms, demographics, and period (during shelterin-place and after subsequent reopening) and estimated the time course of reproduction numbers for all 159 Georgia counties. Transmission varied by time and place but also by persons' sex and race. The mean serial interval decreased from 5.97 days in February-April to 4.40 days in June-July. Younger adults (20-50 years of age) were involved in most transmission events occurring during or after reopening. The shelter-in-place period was not long enough to prevent sustained virus transmission in densely populated urban areas connected by major transportation links.",1,coronavirus,True,Test

"Transmission of COVID-19 varies by region (3,4), setting (long-term care facilities, prisons, and factories) (5), population demographics (age, sex, and race), and even among individual persons (physiologic and behavioral differences) (6). During the early phases of transmission in the United States, new cases were mainly imported by travelers and transmission was associated with human mobility (7). Local transmission was more intense in regions with high population density and in populations with frequent social contacts (3,8,9). When SARS-CoV-2 was introduced into high-risk settings (e.g., long-term care facilities), transmission rates were intense, and the outcomes were often fatal (10).",1,Transmission,True,Test
"To study transmission of SARS-CoV-2, we examined the serial interval for symptom onset (defined as the time interval between symptom onset in a primary case-patient and symptom onset in a secondary case-patient infected by the primary casepatient) and the effective reproduction number Rt (the expected number of cases directly caused by any single infectious person). Rt has been shown to vary strongly; some case-patients have caused superspreading events (11,12).

"Data Source GDPH provided data for all 118,491 confirmed COVID-19 cases in all 159 counties of Georgia during February 1-July 13, 2020. Available data included demographic characteristics (age, sex, and race), clinical characteristics (dates of symptom onset, recorded symptoms, hospitalization, and ventilator use), and social contacts (contacts between confirmed casepatients and if cases were part of a confirmed outbreak) (Table; Appendix Table 2). Missing values in the data were common; large percentages of values for clinical characteristics were missing. With regard to events possibly driving transmission, periods were categorized as early transmission and shelter-in-place during February-April, after reopening (shelter-inplace order was lifted) in May, and further reopening (more restrictions were relaxed) during June-July (Appendix Table 1). For this study, we defined a COVID-19 case as SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription PCR irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Tracked Pairs: Serial Intervals and Characteristics of Transmission On the basis of reported contacts with confirmed casepatients, we identified pairs of primary and secondary case-patients by using the following procedure.",1,Transmission,True,Test
"First, most transmission pairs could be established as a unique close contact with a confirmed case-patient. We assumed that symptom onset for any primary case-patient in a confirmed pair occurred before symptom onset of the secondary case-patient. Second, when an outbreak involved multiple cases, we assigned primary case-patients according to review of the epidemiologic time lines. Usually, there was 1 case-patient whose symptom onset was several days earlier than that of the rest of the case-patients in the cluster, and this case-patient was designated as the primary case-patient. Thus, serial intervals were assumed to be always positive. To examine the influence of ignoring negative serial intervals on Rt estimation, we conducted a sensitivity analysis (Appendix Supplemental Material C). Transmission pairs with serial intervals >15 days were dropped because such long intervals are unlikely, as shown in previous studies (17,18). We modeled the serial interval as a gamma distribution and obtained maximum-likelihood estimators of shape and scale parameters. Furthermore, we explored whether the duration of the serial interval varied by demographic characteristics, various disease symptoms, and periods of symptom onset for primary case-patients. The large numbers of tracked case-patient pairs also enabled us to examine variation in transmission within and between different groups by age, sex, and race.",1,transmission,True,Test
"Confirmed Cases: Reproduction Numbers We estimated probabilities of transmission between any pairs of case-patients in an outbreak by using a transmission probability matrix method (Appendix Supplemental Material B) (16). Using GDPH data for confirmed COVID-19 cases during February 1-July 13, 2020, we estimated Rts by date, and we used dates of symptom onset and social contact information (wherever available) in each county independently by estimating the transmission probability matrix.",1,Case,True,Test
"Among 118,491 confirmed cases, the date of symptom onset was missing for 48,893 (41.3%). These missing symptom-onset dates were imputed according to dates of first specimen collection if available or dates of laboratory report if not (Appendix Supplemental Material A).",1,case,True,Test
"The most recent data are incomplete because not all incident cases have been reported and not all persons have become symptomatic. Therefore, estimates of Rt approaching the present date are biased. Because one of our study goals was to examine the timing and magnitude of the first 2 waves of SARSCoV-2 transmission in Georgia (and not to nowcast transmission), we removed Rt estimates of the most",1,case,True,Test

"Tracked Pairs: Serial Intervals On the basis of 4,080 tracked pairs of primary and linked secondary case-patients in Georgia (Appendix Table 3), we estimated the serial interval distribution as a gamma distribution with a mean (10th-90th percentile) of 4.99 (1.32-9.71) days. Generally, the serial interval was longer when outcomes for primary case-patients were severe, such as hospitalization, undergoing ventilation, having an abnormal chest radiograph result, or death as final outcome (Appendix Table 4). Specific signs/symptoms in primary case-patients (i.e., fever, cough, shortness of breath, or diarrhea) did not shorten serial intervals.

"Discussion During February-July, the estimated serial intervals for onset of COVID-19 symptoms in the state of Georgia seemed to become shorter (Figure 1). Such a phenomenon was also observed in mainland China during January-February 2020 (19). Shorter serial intervals imply more rapid transmission. During February-July, disease prevalence increased in Georgia; by August 25, Georgia had the fifth highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States. One cause of contracting serial intervals could be that persons had more contacts after reopening; in particular, younger persons (20-50 years) might play a larger role in SARSCoV-2 transmission. Also, Kenah et al. showed that increasingly more infectious case-patients are present in the local population, competing to infect susceptible persons, and the expected time until a new infection is shortened (20).",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"The serial interval estimation could also be affected by changing testing practices and contact tracing over the duration of the pandemic. COVID-19 testing capacity and contact tracing ability in Georgia were limited during earlier stages of the pandemic; thus, identification and isolation of COVID-19 casepatients and their close contacts were often delayed. With improved testing capacity, symptomatic casepatients were tested more promptly and isolated more quickly, which led to fewer exposures during their infectious periods. Rapid isolation and contact tracing could truncate transmission and lead to shorten serial intervals. More recent data collected when testing and contact tracing have improved are less likely to be affected by delayed testing and isolation. Contraction of serial intervals continued into May through early July, so the changes may still be explained at least partly by increased prevalence and increased contact rates (Figure 1).",1,contact,True,Test
"Transmission of a respiratory infection such as COVID-19 depends on behavioral factors and in particular on social contacts. Studies of contact behavior have shown that persons tend to have social contact with peers of similar age and demographic backgrounds (21). The tracked transmission pairs in this study show that such assortative mixing also applies to SARS-CoV-2 transmission (Figure 2). The transmission pairs in this study were more likely to be tracked when case-patients knew each other (e.g., family members, friends, or colleagues), whereas transmission in public spaces (e.g., stores or restaurants) usually could not be tracked. Transmission occurs frequently among persons in the same age group and less frequently among those in different age",1,Transmission,True,Test

"A primary case-patient who was male was more likely to transmit infection to a female contact than to a male contact. Female case-patients were infected by male case-patients across a wide range of ages (Figure 3, panel B), and male case-patients were mainly infected by young male case-patients (Figure 3, panel A). A possible explanation may be that female persons tend to be caregivers, taking care of sick persons in the household, and young male persons may be more likely to acquire infection outside the household.",1,case,True,Test
"Similar to the serial interval, transmission patterns also changed as the pandemic continued. The major contribution to spreading SARS-CoV-2 shifted over time to the younger generation. This shift could be caused by elderly persons becoming more careful to protect themselves from infection by taking measures such as staying at home, wearing face masks in public spaces, and observing good hand hygiene. At the same time, younger persons might have been less compliant with quarantine measures and more likely to attend indoor gatherings such as parties or to have visited bars, gyms, and clubs while not wearing face masks.",1,transmission,True,Test

"A limitation of our study is that although data were available for >100,000 cases, clinical information and contacts with a confirmed case-patient were missing on some records. Absence of clinical information may depend on several factors. For example, reporting rates tend to be lower and clinical information more frequently missing for case-patients with mild or no symptoms than for case-patients with severe symptoms. A subgroup analysis showed similar distributions of serial intervals for transmission pairs with complete clinical information and transmission pairs with missing clinical information. This finding lends credibility to the assumption that the absence of clinical information does not affect the overall serial interval.",1,case,True,Test

"In conclusion, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Georgia changed over time during February-July 2020. The mean serial interval decreased from 5.97 days in February-April to 4.40 days in June-July. The younger population (20-50 years of age) was involved in most transmission events during or after reopening subsequent to the shelter-in-place period. By mid-July, 2 waves of SARS-CoV-2 transmission were apparent, separated by the shelter-in-place period in Georgia. Transmission was more intense in counties around major cities and along interstate highways. These transmission patterns can be used to help predict and guide states in COVID-19 prevention and control according to population and region.",1,transmission,True,Test

"Genomic data did not indicate SARS-CoV-2 transmission among workplace employees. Divergence among viral sequences of workplace employees and the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate of 1 mutation per 2 weeks (10) suggest that the 4 other workplace cases were each acquired independently. However, workplace transmission from unidentified employees or customers remains possible. In addition, a workplace employee and household contact had unrelated sequences, suggesting that they also were infected independently (Figure 2).

"Although diagnostic specimens are often discarded by laboratories soon after testing, rapid identification of this cluster enabled the acquisition of specimens from 13 of the 16 cases. Our results suggest that infection was directly transmitted from W-3 to >6 other persons within their household, school, and fitness center. Classroom transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is uncommon in the context of prevention strategies such as masking and distancing; previous studies have suggested that most school-associated cases are acquired outside of school (5,6). However, our results suggest that staff-to-staff and staff-to-student transmission occurred in this classroom. This investigation also adds to evidence that indoor exercise without masks can facilitate SARS-CoV-2 transmission (7,8). Fitness centers might consider moving high-exertion exercise outdoors, improving ventilation, and promoting mask use during indoor exercise. Mask use",1,cluster,True,Test

"The pioneering work of Taylor on the turbulent dispersion of aerosols is one century old and provides an interesting way to introduce both diffusive processes and turbulence at an undergraduate level. Low mass particles transported by a turbulent flow exhibit a Brownian-like motion over time scales larger than the velocity correlation time. Aerosols and gases are, therefore, subjected to an effective turbulent diffusion at large length scales. However, the case of a source of pollutant much smaller than the integral scale is not completely understood. Here, we present experimental results obtained by undergraduate students in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dispersion of a fog of oil droplets by a turbulent flow is studied in a wind tunnel designed for pedagogical purposes. It shows a ballistic-like regime at short distance, followed by Taylor's diffusive-like regime, suggesting that scale-free diffusion by the turbulent cascade process is bypassed. Measurements show that the dispersion of CO2 emitted when breathing in a natural, indoor air flow is not isotropic but rather along the flow axis. The transverse spread is ballistic-like, leading to the concentration decaying as the inverse-squared distance to the mouth. The experiment helps students understand the role of fluctuations in diffusive processes and in turbulence. A Langevin equation governing aerosol dispersion based on a single correlation time allows us to model the airborne transmission risk of pathogens, indoors and outdoors. The results obtained in this study have been used to provide public health policy recommendations to prevent transmission in shopping malls. # 2022 Published under an exclusive license by American Association of Physics Teachers. https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0064826",1,case,True,Test
I. INTRODUCTION,0,,False,Test
"The challenge of offering experimental physics courses online during the COVID-19 pandemic motivated the following question: can students learn experimental techniques during lockdowns while simultaneously working to reduce viral transmission risk indoors? A group of students studying experimental physics at our university worked on several projects to reduce the risk of airborne transmission of SARSCoV-2, including the filtration efficiency of face masks, the calibration of CO2 sensors using candles or dry ice in a closed transparent box, and the analysis of epidemic data. We report here the work on a project to understand the dispersion of viral particles both indoors and outdoors. This project has required a detailed understanding of both diffusion processes and turbulent flows.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"However, turbulence is not an easy subject to teach. At the undergraduate level, topics in fluid mechanics mainly include hydrostatics, potential laminar flows, and viscous flows. The concept of turbulence appears when teaching the drag force exerted on a moving spherical solid as a function of the Reynolds number (see, e.g., Ref. 1). In this approach, one of the fundamental aspects of turbulence, namely, space and time fluctuations, is bypassed. Here, we show that turbulence can be taught by considering the dispersion of particles in a regime where concentration is low enough that it acts as a passive scalar field; that is, the concentration has no dynamical effect on the flow. We treat this dispersion theoretically in Sec. II and also present very simple experiments. In Sec. III, we make use of controlled experiments performed both in a small wind tunnel used for pedagogical purposes, using a fog of oil droplets, and in the large corridors of two shopping malls under various ventilation conditions",1,flu,True,Test
"using CO2. We show that the concentration decays faster than expected by the turbulent dispersion theory of Taylor,2 following instead a ballistic law. Indeed, introducing a single velocity decorrelation time provides a perfect fit to the data. This suggests, as shown previously by Villermaux et al.,3,4 that concentration fluctuations bypass the turbulent cascade: diffusion does not follow a continuous process starting from the injection scale and down to the dissipation scale.5 The Kolmogorov scaling law is not observed. The work presented here can be used to introduce students to the turbulent dispersion not only of pollutant molecules but also of aerosols. We finally discuss the relevance of the results to the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which has motivated this research. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through the airborne route:6 infection happens when a susceptible person inhales viral particles emitted by another infected person. In between their respective respiratory tracts, the air carrying viral particles is gradually diluted by turbulent dispersion. Near an emitter, the concentration of viral particles is, therefore, higher than far away, which has implications on the airborne transmission risk.",1,flu,True,Test

This increased generation rate does not change the dispersion equations as the measured CO2 concentration is still very small in the 10À5À10À4 volume fraction range. The experiment had been designed believing that the turbulent dispersion would be statistically isotropic, as expected for an effective diffusion caused by large scale incoherent turbulent motion.14 Instead, our preliminary observations using a source of micron-sized glycerol/water droplets showed that in most large public spaces, there are air drafts causing bulk horizontal transport and biased dispersion. After identification of the mean air flow direction, non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO2 sensors were placed downstream from the source.

AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION RISK OF SARS-COV-2,0,,False,Test
"SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted in the airborne route by respiratory aerosols: droplets of mucus, ranging between 200 nm and 200 lm, which can contain viral particles.6,21,22 These droplets are produced in the respiratory tract during normal respiratory activity by various fluid instabilities.23-25 The air exhaled by an infected person contains active SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, which may start an infection when one of the virions is deposited on an ACE2 receptor of the epithelium and successfully bypasses the immune response. Infection may also start if virions deposit on the eyes. The probability of infection increases with the intake viral dose, defined as the amount of virus particles inhaled by a person, cumulated over time. It, therefore, increases with the exposure time and with the concentration of viral particles in the air.26,27",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"The viral transmission risk by a given infected patient is, therefore, determined by the concentration in viral particles in the air inhaled by another susceptible person. This concentration is given by the rate of emission of viral particles in exhaled air and by the dilution of the air between exhalation and inhalation. In closed rooms, viral particles accumulate, and their concentration eventually reaches a steady state between exhalation and ventilation, which is the replacement of contaminated air by fresh air. This explains the large transmission clusters in poorly ventilated indoor spaces.6 The average transmission risk, uniform in space, can be determined by assuming that viral particles are well-mixed by turbulence. In that case, dilution is due to the natural or forced air exchanges with outside air.26,27 Near an infected person, however, the concentration is much higher and decays with distance, and the dilution from the exhalation concentration of viral particles to the average concentration of viral particles is controlled by the local airflow. The total transmission risk is, therefore, the sum of an average risk, controlled by ventilation, and an additional risk in the dispersion cone of exhalations. Outdoors, in the absence of homogenizing flow, this short-range risk is the only transmission risk. Respiratory activity, such as unmasked coughs and sneezes, can create large airflows that dominate over the pre-existing flow patterns. In that case, air is exhaled in a buoyant jet that gets gradually mixed at its boundaries as it travels.23,25 Face masks strongly alter the airflow by blocking the jet; small jets can remain along the nose and the cheeks if the mask is not properly fitted.28,29 The stopping distance of a masked respiratory puff is around29 20 cm; the more filtering masks make the puff stop earlier. Beyond this very near field distance, dilution is fully controlled by the ambient airflow, which is what we have extensively developed here.",1,transmission,True,Test
"Our analysis applies to any public space where either face mask wearing is mandatory and there is a horizontal air draft or the air velocity is much larger than the exhalation velocity. We have found that in large indoor corridors, the airflow is a horizontal draft with u ¼ 0:1À1 m,""s. Outdoors, the wind is also horizontal with larger velocities. Understanding the dilution in these public spaces allows us to assess their transmission risk, given biological data on pathogen contagiousness.26,27 This is needed to ground infection prevention policies on a solid physical basis, as some (such as the """"6 ft rule"""") are not (see Refs. 22 and 30 for a historical perspective and critical discussion). Exhaled CO2 is a commonly used risk proxy in well-mixed rooms;26,27 its spatial decay allows for a simple translation of the short-range risk into an""",1,mask,True,Test

V. CONCLUSIONS,0,,False,Test
"In this article, we have investigated experimentally and theoretically the dispersion of a passive scalar (the concentration of particles) by a turbulent flow. This constitutes an accessible problem to teach turbulence at an undergraduate level, combining possible experiments and theory. Using any source of fog, a fan and a camera, the Reynolds decomposition between average and fluctuating quantities can be illustrated qualitatively and quantitatively. The derivations based on physical reasoning and dimensional analysis remain linear and much simpler than attempting to solve the Navier-Stokes equation. While the Reynolds number dependence of the drag force exerted on a solid is useful to introduce dimensionless numbers, asymptotic regimes, viscosity, and inertial effects, as it is usually done in fluid dynamics textbooks (see, e.g., Ref. 1), the diffusion of a passive scalar provides a way to understand the role of fluctuations to enhance turbulent mixing. The applications to the dispersion of odors and animal olfactory search,31 the dispersion of pollutants, or airborne viral transmission are immediately appealing to students.",1,flu,True,Test

"Background. Evidence on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during air travel is scarce. We aimed to estimate the attack rate for wild-type SARS-CoV-2 to improve the evidence base for the adaptation of nonpharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies aboard airplanes. Methods. In collaboration with German Public Health Authorities (PHA), we conducted a follow-up of in- ight SARS-CoV-2 contact persons. We included those contact persons whom the Emergency Operations Centre at the Robert KochInstitute had forwarded to PHA between January to March 2020 (before masking on ights became mandatory) and June to August 2020 (after the introduction of mandatory masking). We retrospectively collected data on whether these contact persons had been successfully contacted, had become symptomatic and had been tested for SARS-CoV-2, and whether alternative exposures other than the ight were known. Results. Complete data that allowed for the calculation of attack rates were available for 108 contact persons (median age of 36 (IQR 24-53), 40% female), traveling on 46 ights with a median ight duration of 3 hours (IQR 2-3.5). 62 of these persons travelled after masking on ights became mandatory. 13/87 developed symptoms, 44/77 were tested (no data for 21 and 31). 13 persons (9 of whom had been SARS-CoV-2 positive) were excluded from the analysis of attack rates due to a likely alternative exposure. We thus identi ed 4 probable in- ight transmissions (2 of which occurred after the introduction of mandatory masking). e overall attack rate resulted in 4.2% (4/95; 95% CI: 1.4%-11.0%). Considering ights after mandatory masking, the attack rate was 3.6% (2/56, 95% CI 0.6%-13.4%), before masking 5.1% (2/39, 95% CI 0.9%-18.6%). Conclusions. e risk of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 transmission during air travel seemed low, but not negligible. In order to formulate an e ective, evidence-based NPI protocol for air travel, further studies considering the di erent transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and vaccination status are needed.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test

"us, for the calculation of attack rates, we included 95 persons traveling on 46 flights. Detailed characteristics of all 95 persons, stratified by time periods before and after the introduction of masking, can be found in Table 1. e median age of contact persons and the proportion of symptomatic index cases differed significantly between the two time periods (p  0.01 and p  0.04, respectively). Notably, the median duration from detection of the index case to successful contact tracing reduced by one day between both time periods, possibly indicating an improvement in contact tracing efforts between and within countries.",1,mask,True,Test

"e total attack rate amounted to 4.2% (95% CI 1.4%- 11.0%). While the point estimate for the attack rate during the time period after the introduction of masking was slightly lower than before masking, confidence intervals overlapped widely (Table 3).",1,mask,True,Test

"In this study among 95 in-flight contacts seated within two rows from the index case, we identified a total of 4 PCRconfirmed, probable in-flight wild-type SARS-CoV-2 transmissions.",1,contact,True,Test
"Our results show that wild-type SARS-CoV-2 transmission also occurred during periods when masking onboard was mandatory. Although our results included time periods with and without masking, the low number of events did not allow for a meaningful statistical comparison of attack rates between periods.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"To our knowledge, there are only a handful of studies to date that have investigated the in-flight attack rates for wildtype SARS-CoV-2 in a fashion comparable to ours, i.e., using the SARS-CoV-2 exposure (and not the outcome) as trigger for the study and including a large number of flights [22, 23, 25, 26]. is design has the advantage of not being overly biased towards flights where SARS-CoV-2 transmission has already been documented. Furthermore, socalled superspreading events among flight travels can be put into perspective as the calculated attack rates in this design represent the average of all included flights.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"A study by Blomquist et al. that investigated flight contacts until March 2020 reported fairly similar attack rates of 3.8% (95% CI 1.3-10.6) among the 79 contact traced passengers sat within a 2-seat radius [25]. e comparable design, definition of cases, and close contacts probably contribute to these results being very similar to our findings [29].",1,contact,True,Test
"An investigation by Hu et al. across 177 in-country flights departing from Wuhan before the lockdown on 23 January 2020 with a total of 5622 passengers resulted in a total attack rate of 0.6% (95% CI 0.43%-0.84%) [26]. is estimate, significantly lower compared to ours and to the results of Blomquist et al., might result from various reasons. In Wuhan, high-risk contacts included passengers within 3 rows seating distance, thus including 2 additional rows where transmission risk was possibly lower, thereby reducing the overall estimate. Moreover, the authors did not provide information on how many contact persons included for the calculation of attack rates had actually been successfully contact traced and/or tested. is might affect the estimate in at least 2 ways: if contact tracing/testing proportions were low, a significant number of in-flight transmissions might have gone undetected. On the other hand, if contact tracing was (nearly) complete, the estimate by Hu et al. would probably be more accurate and hereby highlight a limitation of our investigation, and that of Blomquist et al., both were retrospective analyses where only a minority of all in-flight contacts were successfully contact traced. Considering this, it is probable that infected contact persons were more likely to be successfully contact traced (e.g., as",1,contact,True,Test

"they might have sought testing even without the intervention by the PHA). Furthermore, records of COVID-19 cases were possibly more likely to still be available at the PHA when the retrospective data collection was done while those of negatively tested contact persons might already have been deleted. In both scenarios, the overall attack rate in our study would be biased towards higher estimates.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Most other limitations of our study are related to the fact that initial data collection was not done for study purposes but in order to facilitate fast and effective contact tracing. is might have triggered incomplete data on, e.g., symptom status of the index case or seating distance. However, we do not assume that these limitations significantly affected our results, since the local PHA usually validates whether a close contact had actually taken place. Also, although contact persons were often asked about alternative source of infection other than the flight and these persons were subsequently excluded from the analysis, we cannot completely rule out that community transmission might have affected our results.",1,contact,True,Test
"We would like to point out that our investigation focused on in-flight transmission of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and that conclusions on the attack rates of variants of concern (VOC) should only be made with great caution as most of these VOCs showed a different (and often increased) transmissibility when compared to the original Wuhan strain. To our knowledge, there are no studies that have investigated average attack rates over a greater number of flights for VOCs. In this regard, more research is direly needed.",1,transmission,True,Test
"As to the public health relevance of these findings, we believe that attack rates are one factor to be weighed in when prioritizing contact tracing of flight contacts against other efforts of disease control. us, depending as well on the public health infrastructure and capacities of each country, the decision on to what extent flight contacts are traced should also take other circumstances like the current disease epidemiology in the country of arrival, COVID-19 vaccine coverage and recent emergence of VOCs into consideration.",1,contact,True,Test

"Originated from Wuhan, China in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has emerged as a significant threat to public health, and has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), with 8 061 550 cases and 440 290 deaths occurring worldwide as of 17th June 2020 (World Health Organization a. 2020). While SARS-CoV-2 was initially observed in East Asia, Europe consequently became the center of the pandemic (World Health Organization b. 2020), followed by United States and Latin America, and is currently adversely affecting multiple African countries.",1,respiratory,True,Test
"With the rapid surge in the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2, WHO emphasized the urgent need to coordinate international collaborative efforts to minimize the threat in all affected countries in order to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19 (World Health Organization c. 2020). While the battle against COVID-19 is ongoing, multiple measures have been taken by governments in an effort to slow down and mitigate viral transmission of the respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 in the local population such as",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test

"closing down schools, banning public gatherings/events, stopping mass movements via land, sea and airports, imposing partial/full curfew, implementation of the social distance rules and compulsory use of face masks. When formulating a health policy, key front-line workers within multi-disciplinary teams should be a part of the policy planning to ensure that these policies function effectively (Park et al. 2015). Indeed, government health education messages represent a key source of information for citizens for promoting their self-protective practices against respiratory infectious diseases. These preventive messages generally emphasize improved hygiene, face-mask use and social distancing measures, including avoiding crowds during epidemics (World Health Organization. 2009; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2010; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. 2020). Although the decision-making and application of such measures by governmental bodies is essential for the control of a pandemic, the level of awareness and adherence of citizens to control measures is also crucial for the successful application of the aforementioned measures.",1,social,True,Test
"In the absence of an effective vaccine, public implementation of PPMs is fundamental. WHO has recommended five main PPMs against COVID-19: hand hygiene, social distancing measures, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, practice of respiratory hygiene and self-isolation (World Health Organization d. 2020). Another recommendation by WHO also suggests that citizens should follow advice given by their healthcare provider or their national and local public health authorities in order to obtain information from a reliable source. The level of public adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 and it directly impacts the trajectory of the outbreak in a country. This is particularly valid during outbreaks which, due to their evolving nature and inherent scientific uncertainties, can be associated with considerable fear in the general public, especially if illness or death rates are high (Person et al. 2004). This was a phenomenon observed during the SARS outbreak in 2003, where studies conducted suggest that the level of panic emotions in the population is directly associated with their knowledge and attitudes towards the infectious disease (Hung 2003).",1,vaccine,True,Test

"In the course of a pandemic, the implementation of PPMs represents an important factor for the control of the outbreak and has been shown to have significant protective effects associated (Saunders-Hastings et al. 2017). This study was designed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and implementation status of PPMs by the citizens in Northern Cyprus between 1 May and 4 May 2020. The survey period covers an important time period amid COVID-19 pandemic in which all preventive measures enforced by the local government in Northern Cyprus was in place and the curfew was still ongoing, and therefore provides a timely assessment. Overall, 70-90% of the individuals surveyed were knowledgeable about the droplet and indirect transmission routes of disease transmission, whereas the citizens were aware of the more recently described aerosol route of transmission (van Doremalen et al. 2020) at a lesser extent, approximately 44%. The survey responders also demonstrated a 90% knowledge of the incubation period for COVID-19, demonstrating a high comprehension of disease characteristics during the pandemic. Recent surveys on public knowledge on COVID-19 in China, where the pandemic has emerged, demonstrated an overall 90% correct rate on a COVID-19 knowledge test which included questions on main clinical symptoms, viral transmission, observation period and age groups affected (Zhong et al. 2020).

However, health authorities in parts of Asia encouraged all citizens to wear masks in public setting, and the Czech Republic applied mandatory use of face masks to prevent viral spread in the community (Servick 2020). The Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) has also recommended the use of cloth face coverings or cloth masks in public settings with particular risk of community-based transmission (Centers for Disease Prevention and Control. 2020). In Northern Cyprus, the mandatory use of face masks was implemented by the local government on 24th April 2020.

A cross-sectional research design with chain mediation model involving 4612 participants from participating 8 countries selected via a respondent-driven sampling strategy was used. Participants completed online questionnaires on physical symptoms, the need for health information, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The results showed that Poland and the Philippines were the two countries with the highest levels of anxiety, depression and stress; conversely, Vietnam had the lowest mean scores in these areas. Chain mediation model showed the need for health information, and the perceived impact of the pandemic were sequential mediators between physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection (predictor) and consequent mental health status (outcome). Excessive and contradictory health information might increase the perceived impact of the pandemic. Rapid COVID-19 testing should be implemented to minimize the psychological",1,Coronavirus,True,Test

"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. As of December 4 2020, the number of confirmed cases was 65,528,133, the number of death cases was 1,511,726 and the number of recovered cases was 45,371,073 w­ orldwide1. While one may not necessarily contract COVID-19 during this time, certainly, his or her mental health is likely affected due to financial ­burden2, occupational injury due to potential risk of ­infection3 as well as the loss of livelihoods and ­opportunities4. The COVID-19 pandemic has become an urgent issue on global mental health and an unprecedented challenge for healthcare systems of all ­countries5. Emerging psychological disorders and mental health has been identified as the tenth leading research topic during the COVID-19 p­ andemic6.",1,coronavirus,True,Test
"A study of the early-stage COVID-19 pandemic in China found anxiety in 6.33% and depression in 17.17% of 600 ­respondents7. In other Asian countries, a new questionnaire, i.e., the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, was developed in ­Iran8, but this questionnaire did not measure other psychiatric symptoms such as depression. In Pakistan, mental illness poses a significant challenge to its under-resourced health care s­ ystem9. In Italy, the healthcare system stretched to its limit because healthcare workers constituted10% of Italy's confirmed COVID-19 c­ ases10 As a result, recent guidelines recommended all healthcare workers should receive psychological support based on coping strategies for managing ­stress11. In Europe, the levels of psychiatric symptoms were generally low at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, younger Spanish individuals with chronic diseases reported more symptoms than the rest of the ­population12. In the United States (US), Asian Americans were less likely to report psychiatric symptoms than Caucasian Americans during the COVID-19 p­ andemic13. Studies from China, Italy, Germany and Russia identified protective and risk person factors for mental health during COVID-19. Risk factors for adverse mental health include younger a­ ge14, especially young people who had to work outside their ­domicile15, reduced ­income14, family member infected by COVID-1915, having chronic ­diseases14, concerns related to COVID-19 infection for themselves or family m­ embers14, living a­ lone14, having family c­ onflicts14.

"Researchers observed that mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety were affected by the ­pandemic18, but the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. Several behavioral theories could be applied to identify factors that influence mental health during the pandemic. One health behavior theory is the protection motivation theory developed by R.W. Rogers in 1­ 97519. According to this theory, the COVID-19 pandemic might trigger the threat-appraisal and coping-appraisal p­ rocesses19. The public would experience uncertainty and become very concerned about physical symptoms, which resemble COVID-19 infection. Due to the potential threat and impact of the pandemic, they would become worried that they did not have enough health information to protect themselves. For the coping-appraisal process, a person would search for health information to enhance understanding of the pandemic and take measures to reduce the risk of developing an i­nfection20. The information-buffer hypothesis suggests that health information could buffer against physical symptom threats, thus reducing anxiety, depression, and stress. On the contrary, the overload of health information, especially inaccurate and misleading information, might lead to adverse mental health outcomes. Recently, Amanzio et al. (2020) proposed a theoretical framework to explain the association between health information, the psychological impact of a pandemic, physical symptoms and mental health outcomes based on the nocebo phenomenon for the infectious ­disease21. During the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicting and inaccurate health information (e.g., contradictory advice on face mask use) could lead to negative thinking and ­expectation22, resulting in the nocebo ­effect21, which ultimately lead to adverse mental health ­outcomes23. In summary, the physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection would trigger the need to search for health information, affecting the perceived impact of the pandemic and ultimately adverse mental health outcomes (i.e., anxiety, depression and stress).",1,pandemic,True,Test
"To address the above research gaps, this study aimed to compare the mental health outcomes in the general population of 8 countries (China, Pakistan, Philippines, Iran, Poland, Spain, the US, Vietnam) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Based on research conducted before the pandemic, the normative data for DASS-21 are as follows: the mean depression score was 3.87, the mean anxiety score was 2.95, and the mean stress score was 4.8724. In this study, the mean DASS-21 scores of all countries were higher than normative data except Vietnam. For IES-R, the means IES-R scores reported by healthy citizens after witnessing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was 20.17.25. In this study, the mean IES-R scores of Chinese, Spanish, Polish, Iranian, American and Pakistani respondents were higher than healthy citizens witnessing CPR except for Filipino and Vietnamese. We observed that Pakistan and Poland were the two countries with the highest DASS-21 subscale scores. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Happiness Report ranked the countries that had the greatest improvement of happiness from 2005-2008 to 2016-2018 as follows: Philippines (+0.860), Pakistan (+0.703), Poland (+0.445) and China (+0.426)26. In contrast, United States (- 0.446), Iran (- 0.713) and Spain (- 0.793) showed reduction in happiness scores from 2005-2008 to 2016-201826. The COVID-19 pandemic might reverse the increase in happiness scores in Poland and Pakistan. Each country faced unique challenges during the pandemic. Respondents from Poland reported high DASS-21 stress, anxiety and depression scores. A recent Polish study found that loneliness was correlated with psychiatric symptoms and emotional response to physical health threat during the COVID-19 p­ andemic27. Furthermore, increased worry about the social isolation and concerns for financial problems was observed in lonelier ­Poles27. Additionally, the Polish media frequently reported that the healthcare system in Poland was not prepared to fight the pandemic, having to deal with staff shortages, deficit in medicine supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) for health personnel or hospital closures, which may have had an impact on the mental health of the P­ oles28. Pakistani respondents reported high levels of DASS-21 stress, anxiety and depression scores, which may be related to perceptions of an incomplete response to COVID-19 due to poor sanitation, lack of basic preventive measures, lack of proper testing and medical f­acilities28. Pakistani health professionals started protesting and threatened to quit work due to a lack of P­ PE28. The unpreparedness and contradictory policies resulted in an alarmingly high COVID-19 spread and worsening mental health of Pakistani people, although data collected on mental health was during the peak time of the COVID-19 spread in the country. Chinese respondents reported the highest IES-R scores. China was the first country to report COVID-19, but the Chinese people were also accused of not being transparent about the COVID-19 and spreading the virus across the ­world29. The editor-in-chief of The Lancet, Richard Horton expressed concern about discrimination or revenge actions toward China and C­ hinese30. Iran ranked second in terms of high IES-R and DASS-21 anxiety scores. The economic sanctions that prevented medical supplies, equipment and drugs from arriving in ­Iran31 could lead to anxiety among Iranians during the pandemic.",1,pandemic,True,Test

"The current study is the first to demonstrate the mediation mechanism underlying the association between physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection and mental health outcomes. Based on the chain mediation model, physical symptoms were positively associated with higher anxiety, depression and stress. This result adds to previous studies that have suggested that real or perceived infection threats could lead to negative psychological ­reactions36, and people's anxieties were closely related to physical ­symptoms37. Experiencing physical symptoms that resemble COVID-19 infection could trigger ­hypochondriasis38, and a higher number of physical symptoms experienced could lead to strong disease ­conviction39. As a result, rapid diagnostic test development and implementation are crucial to alleviating adverse mental health outcomes when a person experiences physical symptoms similar to COVID-19 ­infection40. The uncertainty of potential threat during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic could trigger anxieties, depression and stress much more than f­ear38. The current study also identified the role of health information as a mediator in the link between physical symptoms and the perceived impact of the pandemic. During the strict lockdown, people were refrained from social ­interaction41 and spent more time at home and searching for health information online. Consistent with the protection motivation ­theory19, the need to search for more health information is triggered by activity in survival circuits that detects imminent threats of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the need for health information was not associated with adverse mental health outcomes, which might partially support the information-buffer hypothesis. The need for health information formed a sequential mediation path with the perceived impact of the pandemic on mental health outcomes. This finding is consistent with previous research about information-induced behavioral changes during the COVID-19 l­ockdowns42. Excessive health information might heighten the perceived impact of the pandemic through cyberchondria that is defined as the unfounded escalation of concerns about COVID-19 symptoms based on a review of search results and literature ­online43. According to the nocebo ­phenomenon21, conflicting health information (e.g., confused face mask policy)22, unproven conspiracy t­ heories44 and ­rumors45 also enhanced the negative impact of the pandemic. In contrast, people who were likely to less frequently accessed health information were less anxious, depressed and stressed, and worried about the p­ andemic46. Our findings confirmed the second path of the indirect effect: that physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection was associated with a higher level perceived impact of the pandemic and led to adverse mental health outcomes. This finding is consistent with previous research that symptoms of emerging infectious diseases might lead to stigma and adverse mental health o­ utcomes47. In summary, the current study provided evidence that the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with the need for health information which was rooted in the physical",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"The findings of this first multi-national study have several implications on public mental health strategies. Firstly, Kaslow et al. (2020) proposed that community mental health strategies include providing support groups, participating in health education outreach and disseminating mental wellness ­guides48. Furthermore, mental health professionals should offer online psychological interventions such as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based therapy to improve the general population's mental h­ ealth49. The COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to introduce and promote telepsychiatry that overcomes the quarantine measures and geographical distance for mental health ­assistance50. Second, as physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection (e.g., headache, chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, coryza) were associated with adverse mental health outcomes, the lack of testing for coronavirus could worsen mental health. There is an urgent need to develop accurate, rapid diagnostic tests in general practitioners' clinics, community and rural ­settings51. For low income countries, coronavirus testing should be easily accessible and free. A negative COVID-19 test result for members of the general population who present with physical symptoms may alleviate anxiety, depression and stress. Third, based on our findings, the WHO, governments and health authorities should provide regular updates on health information including effectiveness of prevention strategies, therapeutics, and vaccines and treatment methods. The study results could contribute reference information to various countries that need to monitor public mental health status and provide accurate and consistent health information during the ­pandemic37.",1,community,True,Test
"Limitations. This study has several limitations. The first limitation was that the study population had different sociodemographic characteristics as compared to the world population. The respondent sampling method also compromised the representativeness of samples. The study population was female predominant (proportion of female in the study population: 68.55%; world population: 49.58%)52 and a high proportion of the study population possessed a university degree (proportion of degree holders in the study population: 70%; world population: 7%)53. The second limitation was sampling and selection bias because we could not reach out to potential respondents without Internet access in both countries. There was an uneven number of participants among 8 countries because 1938 Vietnamese participants were excluded due to incomplete questionnaires, and a smaller number of Iranian participants were recruited due to lack of Internet access in some areas of Iran. The third limitation was the cross-sectional nature of this study. Although the chain mediation model contributes to our understanding of the mediational factors that might influence the association between physical symptoms and adverse mental health outcomes, it cannot verify the temporal relationship. A longitudinal study is required to verify the direction of the paths further. The fourth limitation was that we did not record demographic data regarding the pre-existing mental illness of the study participants. The fifth limitation was that self-reported psychological impact levels, anxiety, depression and stress may not always be aligned with objective assessment by mental health professionals. Nevertheless, the perceived impact, anxiety, depression and stress are based on personal feelings, and self-reporting was paramount during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sixth limitation was that we could not confirm whether participants were seropositive to COVID-19 at the time of the survey because it was an online questionnaire-based study. Another possible limitation was the different recruitment periods of participants for each country and we planned to study the impact of COVID-19 during the peak periods that varied from country to country. Lastly, we were unable to calculate the response rate. For potential respondents who were not keen to participate in the online survey, no response was recorded, and we could not collect any information from them.",1,area,True,Test
"In conclusion, this multi-national study across three continents results provides empirical evidence that COVID-19 affected mental health worldwide. We found that Poland and Pakistan were two countries with the highest mean scores in IES-R and DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress scales. In contrast, Vietnam had the lowest mean scores in IES-R and DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress scales. The chain mediation model shows that the need for health information and the perceived impact of the pandemic exert sequential mediating effects on mental health outcomes in people who experience physical symptoms that resemble COVID-19 infection.

Demographic data about age, gender, education, household size, marital status, parental status and residential city in the past 14 days were collected. Physical symptoms related to COVID-19 included cough, fever, gastrointestinal and other symptoms. Respondents also rated their physical health status and stated their history of chronic medical illness. The health information required for the COVID-19 pandemic includes symptoms related to COVID-19, prevention and treatment advice, need for a regular update, knowledge in local transmission, the effectiveness of drugs and vaccines, travel advice, transmission methods and other countries' responses. The internal consistency of subscales on physical symptoms and the need for health information was examined using Cronbach alpha coefficients.

"The psychological impact of COVID-19 was measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The IES-R is a self-administered questionnaire that has been well-validated in the American, European and Asian populations for determining the extent of psychological impact after exposure to a traumatic event (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic) within one week of e­ xposure57-60. This 22-item questionnaire is composed of three subscales, aiming to measure the mean avoidance, intrusion and ­hyperarousal61. The total IES-R score is divided into 0-23 (normal), 24 - 32 (mild psychological impact), 33-36 (moderate psychological impact) and>37 (severe psychological impact)62. For the regression analysis, the cut-off score for high and low psychological impact was 24. In this study, the Cronbach's alpha for the different versions of IES-R are as follows: China: 0.949, Iran: 0.912, Pakistan: 0.95, Poland: 0.883, Philippines: 0.912, Spain: 0.948, the US: 0.959 and Vietnam: 0.92.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"The mental health status of respondents was measured using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS21) and calculation of scores was based on a previous ­study63. DASS-21 has been used to assess mental health in ­American64, ­Asian65,66 and E­ uropean67 populations. The internal consistency of DASS-21 stress, anxiety and depression scales was measured by the Cronbach's alpha. In this study, the Cronbach's alpha for different versions of DASS-21 is as follows: China: stress: 0.888, anxiety: 0.845, depression: 0.878; Iran: stress: 0.934, anxiety: 0.891, depression: 0.94; Pakistan: stress: 0.923, anxiety: 0.914, depression: 0.923; Philippines: stress: 0.839, anxiety: 0.784, depression: 0.889; Poland: stress: 0.890, anxiety: 0.854, depression: 0.886; Spain: stress: 0.895, anxiety: 0.876, depression: 0.89; The US: stress: 0.921, anxiety: 0.914, depression: 0.938 and Vietnam: stress: 0.864, anxiety: 0.866, depression: 0.904. For the regression analysis, the cut-off score for high stress score group was35; the low stress score group was10; high anxiety group was20; low anxiety group was6; high depression group was28 and low depression group was9.

"Statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated to compare demographic characteristics, physical symptoms and health service utilization, contact history, knowledge and concern, precautionary measure and additional health information variables among 8 countries. One-Way analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared the mean IES-R and DASS-21 scores between 8 countries to determine whether the associated population mean IES-R or DASS-21 scores were significantly different. If there were significant differences among 8 countries, the Least Significant Difference (LSD) would calculate the smallest significance between mean scores of two countries with different combinations. Any difference larger than the LSD is considered a significant result. We used Pearson's correlation to calculate the correlation coefficients between physical symptoms, the need for health information, and the perceived impact of COVID-19 pandemic and adverse mental health outcomes. Then we followed a stepwise method to construct the best fitting model for the mediated effects of the need for health information and the perceived impact of the pandemic. Mediation analyses were conducted by a regression-based macro for SPSS version 21.070. In addition, a bootstrapping procedure with 2000 replications was run to test the chain mediation model. The significance levels of direct and indirect effects among the four factors (i.e., physical symptoms, health information requirement, the psychological impact of events and mental health parameters) and chain mediating effect would be determined.

Abstract We obtained 24 air samples in 8 general wards temporarily converted into negative-pressure wards admitting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) omicron variant BA.2.2 in Hong Kong. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 19 (79.2%) of 24 samples despite enhanced indoor air dilution. It is difficult to prevent airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals.

"Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) omicron variant in November 2021, it became the dominant variant circulating globally. The evolving SARS-CoV-2 omicron sublineages from (BA.1 to BA.2 to BA.4 to BA.5) have demonstrated progressively increased transmissibility,1 leading to explosive outbreaks in the community.2 Whether the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant increased the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission in the healthcare setting remains uncertain. Recent studies have shown that the universal use of surgical respirators as a component in infection prevention contributed to the rapid control of SARS-CoV-2 omicron transmission in the hospital.3 Universal use of surgical respirators in the healthcare setting was also advocated when the infection rate of COVID-19 in community was high.4 The preliminary findings of surgical respirator use in the SARS-CoV-2 omicron era may provide an indirect implication of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant in the clinical areas.",1,respiratory,True,Test

This is a general ward in Queen Mary Hospital, a 1,700-bed university-affiliated hospital, to be temporarily converted into negative-pressure ward caring for COVID-19 patients. The ward has an open cubicle design with ceiling height of 2.2 m. In the original design, the air supply was vented to each patient cubicle and the air exhaust was located in the corridor. During the conversion process, the air exhaust in the corridor was closed. With the installation of mobile modular high efficiency particulate arrestance filter units (MMHUs) and exhaust fans in each cubicle, negative pressure was established and the direction of airflow was demonstrated from the cubicle to window by engineers at the time of testing and commissioning.

"sublineage BA.2.2 during the fifth wave of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the air samples were significantly associated with more COVID-19 patients in wards, patients with higher viral load using Ct value as surrogate, and longer duration of air sampling by univariate analysis. These are reasonable findings because more COVID-19 patients in the ward with higher viral load would result in exhalation of more virusladen aerosol. However, viral load in our air samples was low, probably because of the installation of mobile modular high efficiency particulate arrestance filter units (MMHUs) and exhaust fans in the windows to improve the indoor air dilution (Fig. 1).",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"The finding of SARS-CoV-2 dispersal in the NPWs may have an impact on hospital infection control, especially in general wards or other clinical areas where the indoor air dilution is not as good as AIIRs or NPWs. Asymptomatic COVID-19 patients may spread the virus in these areas via airborne route, which may result in outbreaks. Prolonged exposure to COVI9-19 patients may have an increased risk of infection. This factor was indirectly implied in our multivariable analysis in which the duration of air sampling was negatively correlated with the Ct value of air samples. The use of surgical respirators by HCWs may protect them from acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 and may minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 dispersal from infected HCWs. However, discomfort would increase over time with continual respirator use at work,9 making universal use of surgical respirator not practical, especially during a nonoutbreak period. In addition, it is impossible to eliminate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 dispersal from infected patients. Although surgical masks can be provided to all patients, compliance may not be 100%.10 The MMHUs cannot be installed at all wards because of its large size. Enhancement of indoor air dilution by installation of MMHUs could not eliminate the virus, as shown in our study. Therefore, it is difficult to prevent airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals. Promulgation of COVID-19 vaccination is the key to protect patients and HCWs from developing severe infection when transitioning from the pandemic to endemicity.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"This study had several limitations. We did not perform WGS for the air samples due to low viral load. However, the WGS of our hospitalized patients confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 omicron sublineage BA.2.2, which was also the predominant sublineage during the fifth wave of COVID-19 in Hong Kong.2 We did not report the details of COVID-19 transmission in wards. Given the finding of air dispersal of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 would be possible. We did not perform virus isolation for the air samples. The low level of RNA detected may not directly translate to an infective dose. Nevertheless, our results provide an alert to support continued vigilance against nosocomial airborne transmission of COVID-19.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test

Abstract,0,,False,Test
"The covid-19 vaccine confers direct protection and reduces transmission rates of the virus and new variants. Vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and CoronaVac have been cleared for children in Brazil. They are safe, effective, and immunogenic. There are no known complications associated with the use of steroids or vaccines in pediatric patients with covid-19 and nephrotic syndrome. With or without immunosuppression, these patients are not at increased risk of severe covid-19, and steroids are safe for them. A milder form of covid-19 occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease without the need for hospitalization. The vaccine response may be reduced and/or the duration of antibodies after vaccination may be shorter than in the general population. However, considering risk of exposure, vaccination against covid-19 is recommended. It is believed that patients with hemolytic-uremic syndrome are at higher risk of severe covid-19. Vaccination is recommended, although specific data on the safety and efficacy of the covid-19 vaccine are limited. There is agreement that the benefits of induced immunity outweigh the risks of immunization. Vaccination against covid-19 is recommended for children and adolescents needing kidney transplantation or who have undergone transplantation. These patients present decreased immune response after vaccination, but immunization is recommended because the benefits outweigh the risks of vaccination. Current recommendations in Brazil stipulate the use of the messenger RNA vaccine. This paper aims to provide pediatric nephrologists with the latest knowledge about vaccination against covid-19 for children with kidney disease.",1,covid-19,True,Test

"A vacina covid-19 confere proteção direta, reduz as taxas de transmissão do vírus e de novas variantes. No Brasil, estão liberadas para a população pediátrica as vacinas Pfizer/BioNTech e a CoronaVac, ambas seguras, eficazes e imunogênicas. Pacientes pediátricos com síndrome nefrótica e covid-19 têm curso clínico regular sem complicações relacionadas ao uso de esteroides ou vacinas. Esses pacientes, com ou sem imunossupressão, não apresentam maior risco de covid-19 grave e o tratamento com esteroides é seguro. Os pacientes com doença renal crônica têm covid-19 mais leve, sem necessidade de hospitalização. A resposta vacinal pode ser reduzida e/ou a duração dos anticorpos pós-vacinação pode ser menor do que na população geral. Entretanto, a vacina covid-19 está recomendada, considerando o risco de exposição. Acredita-se que pacientes com síndrome hemolítico-urêmica teriam maior risco de covid-19 grave. A vacina é recomendada, embora dados específicos sobre segurança e eficácia da vacina covid-19 sejam limitados. Há concordância que os benefícios da imunidade induzida superam quaisquer riscos da imunização. A vacina covid-19 é recomendada para crianças e adolescentes candidatos ao transplante renal ou já transplantados. Esses pacientes têm resposta imunológica reduzida após a vacina, entretanto ela é recomendada porque os benefícios superam qualquer risco dessa vacinação. A recomendação atual no Brasil é a vacina de tecnologia RNA mensageiro. O objetivo deste documento é levar aos nefrologistas pediátricos os conhecimentos mais recentes sobre a vacinação contra contra-19 em crianças com doenças renais.",1,covid-19,True,Test

"Covid-19 was first detected in December 2019 in Hubei (Wuhan) province, China. The virus has spread rapidly around the world, and by March 2022, 29 million cases of covid-19 and 652,000 deaths from the disease had been confirmed in Brazil1. In that same period, 6,531 cases of pediatric severe acute respiratory syndrome due to covid-19 and 1,503 cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children with 93 deaths had been confirmed2,3.",1,spread,True,Test
"A large proportion of children with covid-19 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, and the presence of comorbid conditions is considered a risk factor. A Brazilian study showed that 41% of children admitted to intensive care units had comorbid conditions4.",1,covid-19,True,Test
There are few reports on the risk of severe disease from covid-19 in immunocompromised pediatric patients. Population studies have shown that children and adolescents are exposed to the virus in a similar way to adults and are potential vectors in disease transmission5.,1,disease,True,Test
"The covid-19 vaccine confers direct protection, reduces the rates of virus transmission and the emergence of new variants6. Lv et al. have demonstrated the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of these vaccines in healthy pediatric populations. Adverse events are rare and mild, and benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks7.",1,covid-19,True,Test
"The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines (BNT162b2), authorized for children aged five years and older, and CoronaVac, authorized for children aged six years and older, are currently approved in Brazil. CoronaVac (Sinovac) is a vaccine with inactivated virus. The Pfizer-BioNTech covid-19 (BNT162b2) vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle of nucleoside-modified mRNA that enables the expression of SARS-CoV-2 protein S on the cell surface. It causes the activation of cytotoxic and helper T-cells and induction of humoral immunity, thereby producing neutralizing antibodies. Both vaccines are safe, effective, and immunogenic.",1,vaccine,True,Test
"The most common adverse events in children and adolescents are injection site pain, fever, headache, and fatigue. Most of these events were not serious and deaths have not been reported7.

"Most children with idiopathic NS relapse or are steroid-dependent, and require chronic use of immunosuppressants. Urinary loss of endogenous antibodies during NS decompensation and immunosuppressant therapy increase the risk of infections8. Evidence points to immune system dysregulation involving B and T cells as part of the pathophysiology of NS, suggesting that vaccines may promote disease recurrence via the induction of immune response.",1,vaccine,True,Test
"To date, there have been few reports of NS associated with covid-19 infection. A systematic review about covid-19 in patients with NS concluded that, with or without immunosuppressant therapy, patients were not at increased risk of severe covid-19, steroid treatment was safe, and the incidence of disease recurrence remained unchanged9. On the other hand, a study performed in New Delhi showed that patients with decompensated NS had a sixfold risk of developing severe complications during covid-19, such as severe acute kidney injury, shock, respiratory failure, encephalopathy, or death10. Cases of NS from minimal injuries triggered after vaccination against covid-19 involving adults and one adolescent have been reported8,11. Recommendations for vaccination are mostly based on expert opinions, considering the lack of controlled studies.",1,covid-19,True,Test

"administration of vaccines is necessary. Extending the interval between doses or discontinuing rituximab infusions allows immature B-cells to recover and proper vaccine response while levels of memory (pathogenic) B-cells remain low. An alternative strategy is to vaccinate patients at least four weeks prior to rituximab infusion or 12 to 20 weeks after the end of the infusion cycle. Monitoring the effect of rituximab from CD19 lymphocyte levels allows the discontinuation of the drug in asymptomatic and selected patients, which allows the definition of the time needed to improve response to vaccination.

"There are few studies about covid-19 in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and on dialysis (peritoneal dialysis, PD, or hemodialysis, HD). These studies report the occurrence of milder disease and no need for hospitalization13,14. On the other hand, Aimen et al. found that CKD was the most common comorbid condition in symptomatic children and adolescents. One of the three deaths reported in their study involved a patient on PD15. In Brazil, one of the countries with the highest number of deaths by covid-19 in the pediatric age group, there is no specific data about patients on dialysis.",1,covid-19,True,Test
"The usual vaccination schedule is recommended for children and adolescents, with special attention to vaccines with attenuated virus, which are contraindicated after renal transplantation. Vaccine response in CKD patients may be reduced and/or antibodies may be active for shorter periods of time than in the general population16. Nonetheless, given the risk of exposure, vaccination against covid-19 is recommended. It is also important that family members of dialysis patients get the full vaccination regimen, especially those with children under five years of age.",1,vaccine,True,Test
"There is no evidence regarding the efficacy of covid-19 vaccines in pediatric patients on dialysis.

They found local reactions in 38% after the first dose, while 29.2% had mild reactions after the second dose (2.1% moderate; 2.1% serious adverse events). Systemic events occurred rarely, and the most frequent were diarrhea (4% mild; 4% moderate) and fatigue (8% mild). After the first dose, 42% developed adequate vaccine response as assessed by IgG levels against anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein18. After the second dose, seroconversion was observed in 97.2% and was correlated with prior hepatitis B seroconversion and age (younger patients). Patients who had local reactions tended to have higher levels of protective antibodies. Conversely, patients on immunosuppressants during the study had lower levels of protective antibodies18.",1,vaccine,True,Test
"Shashar et al. discussed the administration of the third dose in individuals on HD. The authors observed that the group that received the booster, compared to controls, had higher levels of protective antibodies, despite being older and having a greater incidence of hypertension. Serologic response was inversely associated with levels of inflammation markers and malnutrition. A drop in protective antibodies levels was observed eight months after vaccination in the group that did not receive booster shots19. This observation contributed to the discussion of the need for a third dose in individuals on HD20. AngelKorman et al. confirmed this need, while others have wondered whether vaccination of individuals on HD should be considered on an individual basis21,22.",1,protective,True,Test
"Based on study findings, some medical societies have presented specific recommendations for pediatric patients on dialysis. The British Association for Pediatric Nephrology (BAPN) recommends that covid-19 booster be given only to adolescents with CKD older than 12 years23.

This shared pathophysiology suggests that patients with aHUS are at increased risk of developing severe covid-19, regardless of the status of the treatment for aHUS, including individuals previously diagnosed with covid-1926. The recommendation is that these patients are immunized against covid-1927,28. Although specific safety and efficacy data on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is limited, there is agreement that the benefits of induced immunity outweigh the risks tied to immunization29. In Brazil, the use of live inactive virus vaccines (CoronaVac/Sinovac) has not been authorized for immunosuppressed patients27. Since aHUS is a serious condition, it has been excluded from the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccine trials. Thus, it is unclear whether currently available vaccines are as effective for these patients as they were for the studied populations30,31.

ABSTRACT,0,,False,Test
"Background: The risk of possible cross-reactions between serological tests, together with the clinical similarities between dengue fever and COVID-19, can delay diagnosis and increase the risk of both COVID-19 transmission and worsening. The present study aimed to determine the possibility of cross-reactions among rapid serological tests based on clinical symptoms.",1,clinical,True,Test
"Methods: Patients with COVID-19, confirmed by RT-PCR and clinical criteria for diagnosing dengue, were recruited consecutively between September 2020 and August 2021 and underwent rapid immunochromatographic diagnostic (RID) tests for AgNS1, IgM, and IgG. Patients who tested positive for acute-phase dengue IgM and AgNS1 underwent a follow-up test after 12-30 days for diagnostic confirmation.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Results: A total of 43 patients were included, 38 of whom required hospital admission, and 8 received intensive care. Seven patients tested positive on the RID tests, comprising 2 NS1 positive (coinfection), one reactive for IgM and IgG (coinfection), three reactive for IgM not confirmed (false-positive), and one reactive for IgG due to previous infection. Two of the 3 patients with coinfection died. Fever, myalgia, headache, and cough were the most common clinical symptoms, while lymphopenia was the most prevalent laboratory finding.",1,positive,True,Test

"Many other countries have also reported cases of dengue and COVID-19 coinfection, some of which showed a worse evolution10,11. Dengue is diagnosed based on clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data.

The sensitivity of these tests depends on the time since symptom onset1.",1,case,True,Test
"In diagnosing COVID-19, besides clinical and radiological evidence, nasal/oral swab samples are used for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antigen tests3.

Antigen tests tend to yield faster results but provide lower sensitivity than RT-PCR3,12.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"The possibility of cross-reaction of infection by the novel coronavirus with serological tests for dengue is a concern in countries where the two viruses coexist5,13 because, in addition to the possible impact on patient health, there is a risk of delay in adopting the measures needed to prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In view of this risk, the objective of the present study was to follow up on patients presenting to the hospital with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and symptoms resembling dengue and to investigate the possibility of coinfection and cross-reactivity with dengue RID tests.",1,coronavirus,True,Test
METHODS,0,,False,Test
"Study type, population, and setting",0,,False,Test
A prospective observational case series study was conducted to assess the signs and symptoms suggestive of dengue in patients with confirmed COVID-19 and to determine the specificity of acute-phase serological tests for dengue IgM and NS1 in patients with confirmed COVID-19.,1,case,True,Test
"The study protocol was approved by the ethics review boards of two private hospitals in the city of Maringá (Paraná State) and by the Research Ethics Committee of the State University of Maringá under CAAE no. 36501620.5.0000.0104, permit no. 4.226.639, on the 20th of August 2020. The study population included patients treated at the emergency department and/ or admitted to adult intensive care units (ICUs) and/or adult infirmary wards diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 using nasal/oral swab samples during the period from September 2020 to August 2021. Patients were selected by convenience sampling based on the signs and symptoms presented. The physician responsible for the admission of the patient was informed, and there was no influence on the therapeutic management of the patient.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"The inclusion criteria were patients older than 18 years, admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed via RT-PCR assay, in association with diagnostic clinical criteria for dengue (fever for up to 7 days and at least two of the following signs and symptoms: headache/retro-orbital pain, nausea/vomiting, myalgia, arthralgia, exanthem, petechiae, or leukopenia).

Procedure,0,,False,Test
"Cases of COVID-19 were confirmed via real-time RT-PCR tests performed at laboratories approved by the National Ministry of Health. Serum samples were collected for rapid diagnostic (RID) testing using the OnSite Dengue IgM/IgG (CTK Biotech, San Diego, CA, USA) and OnSite Ag kits, and for detection of NS1 (Antigen CTK Biotech, San Diego, CA, USA). Lateral flow immunochromatography was carried out at the Núcleo Diagnóstico laboratory.",1,Case,True,Test
"Patients who tested positive on the acute-phase dengue test (AgNS1 or IgM) underwent follow-up serological collection 12-30 days after the first test.

DISCUSSION,0,,False,Test
The difficulty in differentiating dengue from COVID-19 is a cause for concern in countries with a high incidence of both viruses15-18. The present study confirmed this diagnostic difficulty by presenting a case series of patients who met the criteria for suspected dengue and had a clinically confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.,1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Although respiratory symptoms are important in cases of suspected COVID-19, unspecific systemic symptoms, such as fever, headache, and myalgia, were most common in the present study, followed by cough, diarrhea, and respiratory distress, due to the inclusion criteria of this investigation. Compared with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most common symptom among inpatients with COVID-19 was shortness of breath, while less than half of the patients presented with fever on hospital admission19. Among outpatients, however, fatigue, headache, and myalgia followed by sore throat, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea were more frequent19. Thus, in outpatients with COVID-19, the predominance of systemic symptoms hampers the differential diagnosis. The symptoms common to both diseases, together with the symptoms that differentiate them, are shown in Figure 2.",1,respiratory,True,Test

In contrast, a study involving 50 cases of coinfection found fever in 52% of patients and a greater rate of progression to death, and most of these cases had alarm signs or severe dengue29.

"The occurrence of cross-reaction with the dengue antigen and antibody test among flaviviruses, such as Zika and yellow fever viruses32, has been described. However, cross-reactivity of serological IgM and IgG antibody tests in patients with COVID-19 and dengue has been observed both in the present study and by several other authors6,9,33. Lustin et al.9 found a 22% falsepositivity rate using dengue IgM/IgG RID tests in patients with RT-PCR-diagnosed COVID-19 in a non-endemic region for dengue, although these results were not confirmed when repeated using the ELISA technique. In the present study, only three (7%) patients had possible cross-reactions, a pattern similar to that reported by other authors34,35. A study conducted in Indonesia that assessed 95 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID cases based on dengue RID tests detected only one IgM-positive case, one IgG-positive case, and one probable case of coinfection with positivity for NS1, IgM, and IgG34. In an Italian study, no IgM/IgG positivity for dengue was found in 32 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, although the tests were performed using ELISA36.

"The present study had some limitations. First, a small number of patients were included, explained by the inclusion criteria of symptoms of suspected dengue. Second, low circulation of DENV in the city during the study period may have contributed to the occurrence of a few cases of coinfection. Third, the method used for diagnosing dengue was the RID test, and DENV positivity was not confirmed via RT-PCR or ELISA. This shortcoming was partially remedied by repeating the RID tests after 12-40 days in patients who tested positive for acute-phase dengue (NS1 antigen and IgM antibody).",1,case,True,Test
"Similar to other studies, the present study identified both patients with positive cross-reactions and those with coinfection6,33.

"Background: Countries worldwide are focusing to mitigate the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by employing public health measures. Laboratories have a key role in the control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Serology for SARS-CoV-2 is of critical importance to support diagnosis, define the epidemiological framework and evaluate immune responses to natural infection and vaccine administration. Aim: The aim of this study was the assessment of the actual capability among laboratories involved in sero-epidemiological studies on COVID-19 in EU/EEA and EU enlargement countries to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies through an external quality assessment (EQA) based on proficiency testing. Methods: The EQA panels were composed of eight different, pooled human serum samples (all collected in 2020 before the vaccine roll-out), addressing sensitivity and specificity of detection. The panels and two EU human SARS-CoV-2 serological standards were sent to 56 laboratories in 30 countries. Results: The overall performance of laboratories within this EQA indicated a robust ability to establish past SARS-CoV-2 infections via detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, with 53 of 55 laboratories using at least one test that characterised all EQA samples correctly. IgM-specific test methods provided most incorrect sample characterisations (24/208), while test methods detecting total immunoglobulin (0/119) and neutralising antibodies (2/230) performed the best. The semiquantitative assays used by the EQA participants also showed a robust performance in relation to the standards. Conclusion: Our EQA showed a high capability across",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test

"What did you want to address in this study? Robust serological test systems to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human serum samples are important to establish whether past infections occurred and to assess the extent of immunity in the population. We want to enable laboratories and countries employing public health measures to assess the quality and robustness of different serological tests that are being used in European expert laboratories. What have we learnt from this study? The majority of laboratories (53 of 55) used at least one serological test that was able to characterise all the serum samples correctly. The performance of serological assays varied for different types of antibodies. What are the implications of your findings for public health? Our study showed a high capability across European reference laboratories for reliable diagnostics for SARSCoV-2 antibody responses. Aside from assessing the total share of people with immunity in the population, reliable serological diagnostics are also important to guide public health actions by helping to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic cases.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test

"Countries worldwide are focusing to mitigate the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic [1] by employing public health measures, including increasing vaccination roll-out and restriction of movements. Laboratories have a key role in the control of the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by detecting acute and previous infections with the virus in a reliable and timely fashion. While the detection of acute infections, typically done by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) or antigen (Ag) testing, can be used to stop transmission chains through isolation and quarantine measures [2], the detection of immunological markers for past SARS-CoV-2 infections and/or vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 is used to estimate immunity [3] in both individuals and communities, thereby informing mitigation strategies. Most serological assays detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as the main immunological marker. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the spike protein represents one of the main concerns for the potential of immunological escape from the antibodies response.",1,coronavirus,True,Test
"The vast impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public health, economies and societies drives the rapid development of numerous serological assays by laboratories and commercial entities [4]. These tests are not only based on different techniques, e.g. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA), lateral flow assays (LFA) and virus neutralisation tests (VNT), but also use different antigenic targets and are able to detect different types of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, e.g. total immunoglobulin (Ig), IgG, IgM, IgA and/or neutralising antibodies. Besides the fact that each laboratory needs to perform validation and evaluation studies before implementing a new test [5], it is crucial to assess the capability of the laboratory to perform the test through an external quality assessment (EQA) based on proficiency testing. Proficiency testing enables a comparison of the accuracy of different tests and the performance of different laboratories based on the same material [6-10].",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"The EQA panels were composed of eight different, fully characterised, pooled human serum samples and addressed both sensitivity and specificity of detection. Five samples contained anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, while three samples did not (Table 1). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive sera were collected from individuals with different severities of disease: mild, non-hospitalised cases (two samples that contained mixed sera from multiple patients) and severe, hospitalised cases (three samples that contained mixed sera from multiple patients). The sera from individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection were a collection of residual routine diagnostic anonymised samples and not suitable to evaluate antibody waning. The median time from infection diagnosis to sample collection was 17.5 days (range: 5-92 days). The obtained serology results for the preparation of the EQA were not used for the clinical management of the patients. All sera from individuals with a SARSCoV-2 infection were collected in 2020 before COVID-19 vaccine roll-out. The sera from individuals with acute cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection were collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 at the end of 2019 and were anonymised. In addition, sera from individuals with an acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection were anonymised. The anti-SARS-CoV-2-negative sera were pre-pandemic residual sera from routine diagnostics provided by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INMI) in Rome, Italy and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) in Bilthoven, the Netherlands. All panel sera, including the pre-pandemic sera, contained antibodies directed against the common cold coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43; HCoV-229E; HCoV-NL63; HCoV-HKU1).

"Each sample of the EQA panel was extensively characterised by the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 reference laboratories at INMI and RIVM, using a wide variety of serological tests (tests and outcomes of the panel characterisation are provided in Supplementary Table S1). Based on this characterisation, the final composition of the EQA panels was defined (Table 1). All samples of the EQA panel, including the anti-SARS-CoV-2-negative samples (C, E and F) were determined to contain antibodies against the four common human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoVHKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63) by protein micro-array as a quantitative multiplex immunoassay [13].",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"used at least one assay that identified all samples correctly as SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive or negative. IgM-specific assays showed the most incorrect characterisations of the EQA samples. In particular, sample G (IgA+/IgG+/IgM+(low)) was missed by four of five laboratories that used the same commercial IgM-only assay (Euroimmun - Anti-SARS-CoV-2 NCP ELISA IgM) and by two additional assays that should have been able to detect the presence of IgM antibodies based on their technical specifications (AAZ - COVID-PRESTO TROD IgG/IgM; Hangzhou Biotest Biotech - RightSign COVID19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette). The remaining 20 laboratories were able to identify sample G correctly using 11 different assays. Indeed, this sample was characterised by the two reference laboratories to have IgM levels below the detection limit of some assays (find the detailed results listed in Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, eight of 14 IgM-specific assays resulted in one or more false-positive test results. Several studies have shown that in general, IgM assays have a lower sensitivity and specificity than IgG or total IgG assays [14-16]. Hence it is recommended to perform serodiagnostics on multiple isotypes simultaneously to improve the specifics of the overall diagnosis. In addition, although specific IgM antibodies can be detected as early as 4 days after infection and they can help to define the early antibody response, SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger unconventional antibody responses, with cases developing IgG before IgM or others with no IgM [17-19]. Indeed, the majority of laboratories (45/55) used more than one serological test to assess the samples. In case of result discrepancies between IgMspecific tests and tests detecting other types of immunoglobulins, laboratories should consider the timing of a potential infection, but also the higher unreliability of IgM-specific tests. Overall, test methods detecting total immunoglobulin, neutralising antibodies or IgG performed better than test methods that are IgA- or IgM-specific. Test method performance was different neither for commercial and in-house assays, nor for a specific test principle, e.g. ELISA, (s)VNT, PRNT or CLIA/ CMIA/ECLIA. This was also shown by the variety of test methods that characterised 100.0% of tested samples correctly (Table 3).",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"Correct characterisation of the three specificity samples (C, E and F) was more problematic than of the sensitivity samples. Variable test performance for specificity samples has been reported before [20,21]. A likely explanation is potential cross-reactivity with antibodies raised by previous infection with other human coronaviruses causing the common cold [13], as all samples in the proficiency panel of this EQA also contained antibodies against all other seasonally circulating human coronaviruses (Supplementary Table S1). If this was the case, specificity test performance would probably be further reduced in periods of high prevalence of co-circulating seasonal coronaviruses.",1,coronavirus,True,Test

"laboratories as underlying protocols can vary extensively (e.g. whole viruses or pseudotype viruses, number of median tissue culture infectious dose units, incubation period and temperature, cell lines, cut-off, read-out) and this gold standard serology method is mostly used as a research tool in the virology field. A recent European study showed that indeed a substantial heterogeneity exists in neutralising antibody testing approaches, resulting in almost 100-fold differences in raw neutralising titres. However, a direct comparison was possible through harmonisation by the use of a standard defined in IU/mL, which reduced the inter-laboratory variability ca 10-fold [22]. Another study showed that the inter-laboratory variation for neutralisation tests was reduced more than 50-fold when assay outcomes were reported relative to the same (WHO) standard [23]. In our study, the results of the VNT could not be compared through normalisation as the JRC standards were defined with a titre range for neutralisation tests and not with a defined IU/mL as in the WHO standard [24].",1,infectious,True,Test
"The characterisation of the JRC standards with the semiquantitative binding assays by the EQA participants was in range with the standards product information, indicating a robust performance of these semiquantitative assays across different laboratories.

"Notably, all samples used in this study were obtained from patients with natural SARS-CoV-2 infections. We did not include samples from vaccinated individuals. For future sero-epidemiological surveillance studies, the capacity of serological tests to differentiate between antibodies derived from natural infections and antibodies induced by vaccination is desirable. This can be achieved by using serological tests with different antigenic targets, i.e. anti-N (natural infection only) and anti-S detection, to determine the level of natural immunity in the study population and assess the risk of vaccination not being sufficient to protect against a potentially increasing burden on the healthcare system. EQA programmes including also sera from vaccinated people would be of great interest to expand the evaluation of the accuracy of different tests during the next phases of the pandemic when vaccination campaigns are consolidated in most countries worldwide.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"Proficiency testing in EQA schemes allows to compare the accuracy of different tests and the performance of different laboratories based on the same material. Although the number of study participants (n,55) and moreover the total number of performed tests (n,""162) was sufficient to gain valuable insights into the quality of serological SARS-CoV-2 assays, the abundance, availability and variety of different SARS-CoV-2 assays used by the participants, limits the number of results obtained per specific assay by different laboratories and therefore the statistical power and confidence in the results. It would be desirable to perform additional""",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test

"follow-up studies. The wide variety in tests used and general lack of routine incorporation of international standards in SARS-CoV-2 serology prevents comparisons of immune responses across laboratories, thereby hampering standardised cross-border sero-epidemiological surveillance and the wide implementation of immunoassays to identify correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2, e.g. in the context of vaccination policies or the EU Digital COVID Certificate Regulation [25].",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"Nevertheless, proficiency testing is important for individual laboratories. The results of an EQA allow laboratories to identify potential problems and improve the reliability of their diagnosis. Interestingly, one laboratory repeated their tests upon receipt of their EQA results which included three false negative results using two different assays. In this second attempt, the results were correct. This laboratory indicated insufficient homogenisation of the samples as a potential explanation for the observed discrepancies.",1,negative,True,Test
Conclusion,0,,False,Test
"A general capability for reliable, harmonised and standardised characterisation of the main immunological markers of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is crucial to increase the overall utility of serology testing. Potential inconsistent test performance and the absence of a rationale to use quantitative antibody assays due to the, yet, undetermined correlates of protection of antibody levels, currently limits the overall usefulness of serology. Participation in EQAs may help to improve implementation of diagnostic tests. Our EQA showed a high capability across European reference laboratories for reliable diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. Serological tests that provide robust and reliable detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are available. However, the use of standards is necessary for meaningful quantitative measurements to increase the overall use of serology testing, including the evaluation of antibody waning and possible reactivity against more relevant virus variants with immunological escape potential in the prospective of a more `personalised' approach to vaccination strategies. This is particularly relevant given that serology is no longer restricted to reference laboratories. Numerous laboratories non specialised in microbiology are performing serological tests using a wide panel of commercial assays. In order to maintain serological test quality, it would also be advisable to implement EQAs at national level, including schemes to evaluate and distinguish natural immunity and vaccination response.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test

"There is growing evidence that viruses responsible for pandemics, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome, are mainly spread through aerosols. Recommendations have been introduced to reduce the transmission risks of virulent airborne viral particles by increasing ventilation rates, expressed in air changes per hour (ACHs), effectively improving the dilution of pathogens via mechanical ventilation. However, infrastructural and operational costs associated with upgrades of building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems make these solutions expensive. It is well documented that Ultraviolet Subtype C (UVC) disinfection can help lower exposure risks by inactivating viruses and the performance of such solutions can translate into equivalent ventilation. Here, we present the first framework to extract the optimal UVC requirements to improve facility management yet ensuring compliance with ventilation guidelines at lower energy costs. The Kahn-Mariita (KM) model considers the air quality of shared enclosed spaces over time by supplementing the existing mechanical ventilation with localized UVC air treatment and includes variables such as room size, occupancy, existing ventilation, and target equivalent ACH. For example, the model applied to a conference room shows that a UVC chamber with recirculation rates of 160 m3/h increases ventilation from an ACH 3 to 7.9 and reduces the room's reset time from 46 to <10 min with as little as 1 W. Recirculation rates of 30 m3/h however offer no benefits beyond 200 mW, with an eACH of 3.9 and reset time of 31 min. The first finding is that single-pass disinfection is not an appropriate metric of performance, i.e., low recirculation rates increase single-pass disinfection, and, however, only treats a portion of the space volume within a given time, limiting the overall performance. Conversely, higher recirculation rates decrease single-pass disinfection but treat larger portions of air, potentially multiple times, and are therefore expected to lower the transmission risk faster. The second result is that for fixed amounts of recirculating air flow, increasing UVC power helps with diminishing return, while for a fixed UVC power, increasing the recirculating air flow will always help. This dynamic is particularly important toward optimizing solutions, given the constraints system engineers must work with, and",1,pandemic,True,Test

INTRODUCTION,0,,False,Test
"The current COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the lack of readiness to manage pandemics globally and the need for solutions to disinfect the air, which is dominantly responsible for the transmission of pathogens (Zhang et al., 2020a) such as SARS-CoV-2 (Nardell, 2021). As temporary confinements implemented all over the world are slowly being lifted, there is an urgent need to implement safety measures to enable physical proximity between individuals, particularly in shared enclosed spaces such as offices, hospitals, schools, restaurants, and transportation systems (Zhang et al., 2020a). Ultraviolet Subtype C (UVC) radiation, emitted at 200-280 nm with germicidal effect and being able to disrupt nucleic acids (RNA or DNA) (Yin et al., 2013), can be used to disinfect the air, thus managing disease outbreak (Reed, 2010). UVC has exhibited effectiveness against hospital-acquired bacterial infections (Mariita and Randive, 2020), including the promise of lessening contact infections in long-term acute care hospitals (Ethington et al., 2018). In addition, studies carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated that UVC can rapidly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 (Storm et al., 2020) even at high viral titers (Heilingloh et al., 2020). Also, the use of UVC to ensure clean air will save energy by warranting reduced building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy demand (Aviv et al., 2021).",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"With the worldwide accepted findings that the airborne transmission route is the most dominant and highly virulent form of COVID-19 transmission (Zhang et al., 2020a) and with people gathering in closed spaces essentially sharing the same air (Nardell, 2021), we have seen a global trend toward ""healthy buildings,"" driven by the urgency for automated, documented, and reliable disinfection of air, surfaces, and water in shared enclosed/inside spaces. Typically, air quality is ensured by ventilation and increasing air changes per hour (ACHs), effectively diluting the virus by adding air and accelerating the reduction of airborne pathogen concentration (Memarzadeh and Xu, 2012). Unfortunately, in most cases, it is impractical to increase ACHs because required improvements in the existing HVAC systems are costly if at all possible with principal restrictions around ceiling heights, inability to upgrade the ducts or fan, and noise air flow pressure drop imbalance due to nonoptimal dimensioning that results from retrofit solutions. In addition, with centralized air systems, the risks of crosscontamination, with air being recirculated from one room to another, remain (Horve et al., 2020). In fact, except in hospitals, HVAC systems in closed public spaces are designed for the comfort of occupants, with odor control, removal of carbon dioxide, and humidity and temperature control, and may not have enough capacity for the right ACHs for airborne transmitted",1,transmission,True,Test
"disease prevention (Nardell, 2021). It has been demonstrated that improperly applied HVAC systems may contribute to the transmission/spread of airborne diseases (Correia et al., 2020) as also suggested by descriptions from the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship (Zhang et al., 2020b). This has also been indirectly proven using airflow-dynamics models (Chen et al., 2011) and experimental modeling (Li et al., 2005). Additional recent findings suggest that HVAC systems can facilitate SARS-CoV2 transmission via shared air volumes with locations remote from areas where infected people reside (Horve et al., 2020). Moreover, HVAC contamination has been demonstrated in the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak, caused by another betacoronavirus (Kim et al., 2016).",1,disease,True,Test
"Another complication for facility management around increasing ventilation lies with the associated energy consumption in such solutions, as revealed in studies by Aviv et al. (2021), Orme (2001), Awbi (2017), and Chenari et al. (2016). New carbon-zero regulations, energy efficiency scoring, and credits create a strong incentive for managers of these assets to reduce ventilation, the primary source of energy consumption. Indeed, the higher the fresh-air injection rate, the more the heating or cooling required and the more expensive it is if systems are optimized with control to adjust to unpredictable changes in external temperature and humidity. For instance, rotary heat exchangers widely used in new constructions to save energy by capturing heat have raised concerns due to potential transfer of viral loads between the return and supply air flows. Conflicting reports on this account have pushed building managers to bypass them, highlighting the friction between energy efficiency and air quality.",0,,False,Test
"In this study, we present an alternative way of approaching the problem of air quality by using localized UVC for air treatment which is converted into an equivalent ventilation, which we will refer as eACH (sometimes found in the literature as eqACH), (Figure 1). In other words, we look at quantifying the equivalent increase of mechanical ventilation to reach similar air quality within a defined amount of time. This allows reaching ventilation targets without upgrading the existing HVAC system and reversely provides an opportunity to optimize (reduce) the existing ventilation already meeting the recommended ACH by substituting with local UVC solutions. The Kahn-Mariita (KM) model presented here has the potential to rapidly allow buildings to comply with ventilation guidelines such as from the ASHRAE (Schoen, 2020) and WHO (Atkinson et al., 2009), to improve their energy efficiency rating, and provide a simple framework to reopen shared enclosed spaces, increase the time spent in these shared enclosed spaces, and manage occupancy limits, thus accelerating a return to ""normal life."" The KM model is not limited specifically to SARS-CoV-2 and thus also offers a solution effective for any type of airborne microbial",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test

"The uniqueness of the KM model lies in the incorporation of UVC with the existing ventilation. Previous studies from Kane et al. (Kane et al., 2018) and Walker and Ko (Walker and Ko, 2007) have investigated the effect of UVC on airborne pathogen reduction and defined performances of the UVC system independent of the existing ACH. In particular, studies have linked 1) UVC output to occupancy (García de Abajo et al., 2020), which yields a 25 mW/person requirement to increase an equivalent fresh-air injection rate by a factor of 2, and 2) UVC output to volume (Mphaphlele et al., 2015), which suggests 15-20 mW/m3 requirement to reduce risk down to baseline. None of these studies look at the integrated performances with the existing ventilation nor do they allow walking back from a target ACH. Here, we try to provide a strong model to output a room or space eACH rather than a device performance, which allows for better facility management and simplifying the integration of UVC systems for air treatment.",1,,True,Test

"The use of the KM model supports HVAC systems designed for closed shared spaces by helping understand the inactivation of viruses while achieving eACH, thus preventing the spread of viruses via HVAC systems as well as poorly ventilated shared enclosed spaces. This is even more important by recalling that some viruses in the betacoronavirus genera such as SARS-CoV-2 are approximately 60-140 nm (0.06-0.14 micron) in diameter (Cascella et al., 2021). These viruses can easily pass through common filtration systems whose pore size is more than 1 micron since HEPA filters are only used in certain spaces such as isolation rooms or intensive care units (ICUs) (Correia et al., 2020). The approach of eACH consists in assigning a quantitative measure, which consists of localized air treatment in poorly ventilated rooms with UVC light to reduce airborne contaminant concentrations, which corresponds to the same air quality",1,spread,True,Test

"obtain the desired eACH. We find that the two most important factors are the existing ACH and recirculation rate, the first acting as a limiting element and the second as the highest contributor to the increase in equivalent ventilation. UVC output affects the single-pass performance, with its additional relative contribution to eACH regress. The increase in eACH in turn accelerates the time to reach a target concentration, which converges toward a minimum time.",1,,True,Test
"The main problem with airborne pathogens is that in closed, poorly ventilated spaces, the risk of transmission remains high for a long period of time (Klompas et al., 2020). Both calculations and experimental measures show that aerosol droplet concentration is reduced by 63% (Nardell, 2021) for every ACH as demonstrated by van Rijn et al. (2020), Nunayon et al. (2020), and Bazant and Bush (2020). This means that in a typical office room with ACH 3, it takes >46 min to reach a 90% pathogen concentration reduction. This view assumes no new source of contaminants or ignores the droplets that attach onto surfaces. Indeed, recent studies support the theoretical concepts presented here by showing how reduction in viral concentrations affects the airborne transmission risk (Qian and Zheng, 2018), and the results deviated from the linear relationship as the marginal benefit of incremental disinfection or log reduction value (LRV) is lower than the previous one. The key conclusions here are as follows: 1) there is little added value from aiming to higher concentration reduction values than 90% and 2) because the risk is reduced mostly by relatively low reduction rates, any recirculating system should be designed for higher air flows with a low UVC dose rather than the conventional reactor designs traditionally used in water disinfection which aim at increasing the dose by reducing the flow. Here, the dynamics is the key and recirculation needs to be considered, as well as how quickly the total air volume is treated.",1,transmission,True,Test
"For example, consider a room of 50 m3, with an existing ACH of 3 (meaning it takes 46 min to reduce 90% concentration and bring transmission risk back to baseline) and a recirculating unit where air flows at two different velocities, 200 m3/h and 20 m3/h, respectively, into a 70% UVC reflective chamber with 700 mW of UVC optical output. Simple relationships allow estimation of the fluence rate from these parameters, which have proved to be a good prediction of microbial results. The higher fan power scenario ""only"" reduces 73% of pathogens in a single pass, while the lower fan power which increases the exposure time to UVC of air leads to >99.9999% reduction (LRV6) per pass. It must be noted that, in real term, to achieve such a high LRV value will require a very well-designed reactor since any deviation from all flows getting the exact same dose will have a large impact on the LRV (conversely, low LRVs are less sensitive to small variations). However, for the entire room to obtain a 90% reduction, there is acceleration from 46 min without UVC to 9 min for the higher fan power and to 35 min for the lower fan power, leading to eACH 8.5 and eACH 3.6, respectively. We therefore show that the dose or LRV is no longer the relevant metric for air treatment, as it is in both water and surface disinfection where single pass matters and regulations aim for full reductions of specific pathogens. Instead, the most important factors here are the existing ACH and the recirculation speed for the concentration to be sufficiently reduced to keep the risk close",1,transmission,True,Test
"to the baseline. The eACH model captures these dynamics and incorporates variables such as volume of air to be treated, occupancy, reactor design, UVC output and wavelength, and pathogen of interest and only outputs the equivalent ventilation rate and improved time to 90% reduction (other notations used here: D90 or 1 LRV).",0,,False,Test

"Usually, in these applications, increasing the distance between people is the most efficient way to reduce contamination rates. The proximity effect is more pronounced when the ACH is higher because the concentration reduces faster. On the other hand, as a person stays in a closed space, the time-dependent term (second term in Equation 1) becomes the largest factor in the increase in airborne transmission risk. The goal of air disinfection is to bring that risk down converging toward the baseline risk R(d).",1,transmission,True,Test

While it is a good metric to compare devices, the question as to what is the required CADR or chamber performance to meet end-user needs is not accessible simply by looking into a chamber on its own. As we will show, this answer needs to incorporate the existing ventilation, room volume, and occupancy and look at the marginal benefits from adding UVC as it relates to increasing occupancy, residence time, and reducing room's reset time. The KM model therefore starts with the CADR and links it to the end-user requirements. The advantage of CADR is the ability to measure it with microbial studies of single-pass performances; the risk however is to view this measurement as the final indication of performances.",1,,True,Test

Indeed, 90% of the steady-state concentration reached with ACH 2 is approximately the steady-state concentration of ACH 20; thus, if the goal is 90% reduction of a given steady-state concentration, it becomes a different target concentration ratio for the other ACHs. In this case, the time to reach the Css (ACH 2) with ACH 20 is 0, meaning it is already the permanent state reached by reducing the buildup process. This is exemplified by",1,case,True,Test

This allows for consideration of varying equivalent ventilation rates, where reduction in the steady-state concentration with increased ACH or eACH effectively reduces the C/C0 ratio and accelerates the path to the target viral particle concentration. This will be particularly important in bridging data collected in microbial tests where standard protocols only activate UVC after the desired microbial concentration is reached, to an application where the UVC is constantly on.

"It is interesting to look at the effect of UVC output and recirculation rate on the eACH. First, let us consider a change in output and all else equal, with the parameters described above and for an existing ACH 3, which provides the eACH reached with an output ranging from 200 mW to 10 W of useful UVC output. It should be noted that the LRV presented assumes that it follows a linear trend between the dose and every additional LRV, which is not always the case. The model is not focused on the LRV of this problem since it considers the time to reach a single LRV (90% reduction), but it is useful to show that the relative",1,case,True,Test
"benefits of the UVC dose on the eACH decrease with an increase in dose. There is no noticeable difference in eACH or time reduction beyond 1 W (eACH 7.9 and 9 min to D90) and the best use of energy around 500 mW (eACH 7.2 and 11 min to D90), compared to the 46 min without UVC (Table 3).",0,,False,Test
"It is evident that the principal factor in increasing the ACH is the recirculation rate, that is, if too low no matter how much output, only a fraction of the volume will be treated within the time for 1 LRV to occur ""naturally"" with the existing ventilation. We show this by comparing two sets of data (Tables 3, 4), which look at the same system except that the recirculation rate is reduced from 160 m3/h to 30 m3/h. The single-pass disinfection rate increases on the whole but the maximum eACH reachable and disinfection time are reduced dramatically. In addition, there is almost no difference between 200 mW and 10 W (50x higher output) on the eACH (Table 4), even though the disinfection per pass is increased by a couple of orders. The key is therefore to understand the limiting factor in the system, defined as the parameter which prevents the increase in other variables to translate into increase in eACH. In this example, it is the recirculation rate. At a higher recirculation rate, output matters more; however, we see again a nonlinear contribution between the UVC output and its relative increase in eACH or decrease in time to D90(Css(ACH)). At 160 m3/h, we find that 500 mW provides 93% of the benefits of 10 W. It must be highlighted that one important assumption in the model does not consider re-mixing after every pass in the chamber.",1,,True,Test
"While we have shown the limiting factor to be the recirculation rate in air chambers, upper-air systems would definitely not be subject to this limitation. Instead, the KM model can be adapted for upper-air systems by using air convection due to heating and ventilation as recirculation rates, assuming perfect and constant air mixing (which is typically one of the main assumptions in epidemiological models such as Wells-Riley) (Bazant and Bush, 2020) as well as a ""UVC corridor"" acting as a chamber with 0% reflection, meaning the UVC is fully absorbed by the ceiling of the opposite wall.",1,,True,Test
"Another important concept of the KM model is the fact that UVC is seen as a complementary addition to the existing ventilation, therefore offering an integrated model of actual performances.",0,,False,Test

"et al., 2020). The performance of the 200 mW LED-powered upper-air system was similar to a 21 W lamp one, which is explained by the fact that most of the lamp output remains in the upper-air module: the actual UVC output which is transmitted out of the upper-air module is estimated to be around 375 mW considering the conversation of electrical to optical energy (33%), the normalization to germicidal power at 265 nm (90%), and the system loss due to the louvers (6% efficiency). The KM model predicts that the 200 mW system should have accelerated the risk reduction to 4.2 min and the 375 mW (lamp) system to 3.4 min yielding an eACH of 22 and 25, respectively. While the overall performances are well captured, we attribute the differences from the air recirculation in the room which is not properly included. In fact, upper-air experiments include the use of fans for air recirculation, which is not included here and would improve the performances as we have shown the importance of recirculation.",1,,True,Test
Quantifying Benefits,0,,False,Test
"While the KM model allows for outputting eACH and its extracted time to D90 (equivalent to a potential definition of room's reset time for a shared indoor space before re-use), the benefits of eACH are readily found by inputting the new-ACH into the model by Bazant and Bush from MIT (Bazant and Bush, 2020) to quantify the benefits to end-users in terms of additional number of people or amount of time allowed into a shared enclosed space, thanks to the improved air quality level. For a volume of 50 m3 (a typical conference room of app. 4 × 5 × 2.5 m3), the proximity rule of 2 m between every occupant would limit the occupancy to six people. With ACH 3, a maximum of three people are allowed without mask for 1 h if the infective person is in the room, to limit transmission risk. With ACH 12, this number is increased to 7. The guideline restricts the probability of airborne transmissions per infected person to be",1,mask,True,Test
less than the risk tolerance over the cumulative exposure time listed.,1,,True,Test
"The model developed by Bazant and Bush (2020) allows obtaining the maximum occupancy at different ventilation rates, which in turn allows for a direct comparison of the three approaches, namely, the UVC/occupancy, UVC/volume, and the KM model on equivalent ventilation as presented here. For a 50 m3 room, a maximum of five people are allowed at an ACH 7, with the eACH being reachable at various outputs (Table 3). The value of eACH 8 is the maximum reachable but does not allow additional benefit in occupancy from eACH 7. With a minimum output requirement of 25 mW/person, the first approach yields a 125 mW requirement for highly reflective chambers (PTFE >90%). This number would be directly affected by the UVC reflectivity of the material used in these designs, more so than the other approaches. For instance, an aluminum design (UVR 70%) would increase this value to approximately 400 mW.",0,,False,Test
"The second approach on a volume of 15-20 mW/m3 yields 750-1,000 mW requirement. The difference between the two can be understood from the occupancy limitation imposed on the first, and thus, the higher requirement considers the maximum fill-up of the space. None of these considers the existing ventilation, nor the number of infective people in the room. The KM model does and outputs for a target eACH 7 from an existing ACH 3 with a requirement of 500 mW at 160 m3/h recirculating rate (Table 5). The difference from the occupancy model is that as eACH increases, the risk shifts from concentration in the air to the proximity, which is well captured: the KM proximity provides an output equivalent to the occupancy up the point where proximity restrictions are broken down. The volumetric and occupancy approaches converge as occupancy is increased to fill the volume; however, the hypothesis given here is that increasing output will not affect the risk level beyond a certain point.

CONCLUSION,0,,False,Test
"It is challenging to eliminate air recirculation such that only fresh air is supplied to occupants in shared enclosed spaces. The KM model offers blueprints that reduce airborne transmission of pathogens by adding UVC to localized systems and converting the benefits into eACHs, thus complementing the existing ventilation. The model particularly allows withdrawal from a target eACH given by benefits such as increase in occupancy or the time spent in shared enclosed spaces and output a UVC requirement as a function of UVC, space volume, existing ventilation, recirculation rate, and single-pass performance. This allows for devices to be tested on their singlepass performance and to link to the eACH as a function of the recirculation rate and the existing ventilation. Finally, and of importance for building sustainability, the KM model allows the balance of centralized ventilation and localized UVC air treatment options to decrease dependency on outside air injection and increase energy efficiency. This unified view of air quality and energy also provides an alternative approach to upgrade buildings to meet new carbon-zero requirements.",1,transmission,True,Test

Introduction,0,,False,Test
"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread globally, creating a public health and safety crisis. The impact was felt in almost every facet of life, such as health and education services. Due to heavy workloads, health workers were at risk of developing psychological issues such as depression, anxiety, severe stress, and fatigue (1). The COVID19 pandemic also had an impact on the learning system for students, particularly those in the health professions, by shifting from face-to-face to online learning (2).",1,Coronavirus,True,Test
"In this unprecedented era, e-learning may be an ideal option (3). However, it seems more applicable to preclinical phases of medical education, which are lecture-based. In contrast, clinical stages of medical education oblige students to work in interdisciplinary teams to practice their newly acquired clinical abilities while learning about the healthcare system. Therefore, the shift to e-learning may not facilitate clinical skills and competency acquisition during this stage (3, 4). However, it is understandable that medical schools had to postpone clinical clerkships to reduce student exposure, flatten the curve, and protect healthcare workers during the pandemic due to a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) (5).",1,clinical,True,Test
"Due to the COVID-19 problem, healthcare services were forced to use additional human resources, such as students from the healthcare professions. This phenomenon was due to the increased pressure on healthcare facilities, caused by the rise of new cases, shortage of doctors, and increased prevalence of burnout among health professionals (6). Students in the health professions, particularly those in the medical field, could participate in a variety of voluntary activities, both directly in health services (triage, admissions wards, hospital clinics, emergency departments, and diagnostic laboratories) and indirectly (call centers, community contact tracing, and community education) (7). The breaks from clinical rotations also provided opportunities for students to engage in academic writing, improve their understanding of critical appraisal abilities, conduct clinical trials, and learn about data analysis (5, 8).",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"The clinical setting participation varied across different countries and academic institutions. China, Italy, and the United Kingdom integrated medical students into their healthcare systems or graduated them earlier (9, 10). Other countries, such as South Korea and the United States, canceled clerkships to limit patient contact (11, 12). To participate in volunteer work, a student had to be provided with sufficient training, knowledge about their competence, strict supervision, and an adequate supply of PPE (13).",1,clinical,True,Test
"Health professional students volunteered to help the community, profession, and people overcome by COVID-19. From the students' perspective, this activity was oriented to express loyalty to the health profession, and strengthen a",1,community,True,Test
"professional sense of belonging (14). However, some students hesitated to volunteer due to various uncertainties, which could cause sleep problems, stress, persistent feelings of discomfort, dread, and anxiety (15). Volunteering offers several educational and social benefits, such as acquiring new skills in real-time data gathering, efficient communication with communities and public health groups, and social media monitoring (16). Therefore, it can help medical students prepare for their future careers as doctors (17). Due to this phenomenon, we conducted a systematic review to determine the motivating factors, barriers, types of activities, and benefits of health professional students volunteering activity during the COVID-19 pandemic.",1,social,True,Test

"We utilized the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) recommendations for conducting this literature review (18). Before conducting the literature search, the study protocol was approved by all team members. We searched seven databases, including Epistemonikos, ProQuest, Scopus, EBSCOhost, JSTOR, Cochrane Library, and PubMed (Medline via PubMed), for published articles from March 2020 through December 2021 that assessed the factors and specific programs related to health profession students' volunteering involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic era. Hand-searching was also undertaken by examining the references of the selected articles to identify relevant publications that were not indexed in the previously described databases. This step utilized Google Scholar and journals with predominant publications related to health professional education, namely the British Medical Journal (BMJ), BMJ Open, and BMC Medical Education.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"We selected qualitative and quantitative (cross-sectional and cohort) studies that assessed the factors and particular programs relevant to the volunteering activity undertaken by health profession students during the COVID-19 pandemic (such as medical, public health, and nursing students). We only used peer-reviewed (excluding the preprints) full-text articles written in English to ensure data accuracy. Articles in the form of literature reviews, case studies, case-control, clinical trials, protocols, conference abstracts, news, editorials, and posters, as well as articles analyzing non-health professional student populations, were excluded. We also decided to exclude studies that explored pooled student populations. Three reviewers (TPU, MGS, and KMNN) independently screened titles and abstracts with semi-automatic processes using Rayyan QCRI, online software for abstract and title screening (19). The duplicates detected by this software were eliminated. Then, the discussion regarding any disagreements related to the title and abstract screening or full-text assessment was undertaken to reach a consensus. From the 1,239 articles obtained, 266 were removed due to duplications. We identified 162 papers for full-text and reference eligibility examination. In the final stage, 41 studies met the inclusion requirements for data synthesis (Figure 1).",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"from 12 to 10,433 health professional students (medical and other healthcare professions). Included studies predominantly employed medical students as their study population (31/41; 75.6%), whereas one study also using dental students (21) as their subject population. Seven studies (22-28) (17.1%) included multiple health student disciplines (e.g., public health, nutrition, midwifery, in addition to medical students), while three studies (29-31) (7.3%) exclusively recruited nursing students. Our analysis also covered a wide range of regional distributions, with two studies (32, 33) having a global distribution of respondents. The continents where most of the research originated were Europe, Asia, and America, with 34.1%, 26.8%, and 24.4% distributions, respectively. Meanwhile, Africa had a lesser distribution, with four studies (21, 29, 34, 35) (9.8%) included.",0,,False,Test
"The total number of participants summed from all included studies was 37,000. Fifteen of the 41 studies (36.6%) included students from more than two institutions. The majority of the included studies (85.3%) were cross-sectional in design. Other observed types of study included qualitative and cohort studies, with 12.2% and 2.4%, respectively. Data were mainly taken from the primary source through an online questionnaire or survey (32/41 studies; 78.0%).",0,,False,Test
Study quality,0,,False,Test
"We used the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies to assess the likelihood of bias in cross-sectional or cohort studies (Figure 2). Bias in research questions, study demographics, study participation (response rate), recruiting bias, and outcome measures were low (Figure 3). There was a moderate risk of bias since only 26.8% of studies explained the adjustment of their sample size. Meanwhile, a high risk of bias in measuring exposures of interest before outcomes and sufficient timeframes to detect an effect was detected. This phenomenon is mainly related to a large proportion of crosssectional studies, which only collect data (both exposure and outcome) simultaneously. Only 4.9% of studies measured and accounted for potential confounders, thus mostly having a high risk of bias. Overall, the included studies posed a moderate risk of bias, with an approximately equivalent share between low and high risk of bias studies.",1,,True,Test

"Some studies also uncovered elements that led to an individual's rejection of participating in a volunteer position. The critical factor was the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infection (such as transmission, risk of being infected, and personal identification as a risk group). A scarcity of PPE and the unavailability of a definitive treatment were cited as probable causes of this problem (41). Other observable characteristics included the uncertainty of their academic activity (due to a lack of time for reading, studying, and exams) (45, 46), fear about unfulfilling the volunteer task (associated with qualifications insufficiency) (7, 34), and coming from a lower-middle-income family (41).

"Nine studies described the types of volunteering activities carried out by health professional students during the pandemic (7, 8, 22, 25, 27, 39, 46-48). The activities can be broadly divided into nine different categories, defined as hospital works (triage, admission wards, and emergency room) (7, 25, 27, 46), call center and administration (7, 27, 39, 46), epidemiological aspects (contact tracing, testing) (22, 47, 48), online or remote consultation (regarding COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 cases, using phone or internet) (46-49), laboratory-related works (47), food and/or PPE supply (27, 39), mentoring juniors (39), public education (such as countering hoaxes) (48), and in research programs (8). Some students also reported participating in more than one type of volunteering activity (7, 39).",1,pandemic,True,Test
Benefits of volunteering activity,0,,False,Test
"Fourteen studies revealed the benefits of participating as a volunteer during the current pandemic from the health professional students' perspectives (7, 8, 16, 17, 22, 24, 27, 28, 46, 47, 50-53). The most frequently mentioned advantage was to learn and practice, especially to give real aid and explore evidence-based medicine (8, 16, 17, 22, 24, 28, 47, 53). Other benefits included collaborating with non-physicians (8, 22, 47), strengthening communication skills and empathy (8, 16, 17, 22, 24, 50, 54), knowing more about the healthcare system and costs (22), developing leadership and time management (24, 47, 52), helping other people (social benefits) (16, 17, 24, 28, 51), getting recognition (from friends, other healthcare workers, patients, etc.) (7, 46), providing an interactive learning platform (49), receiving financial compensation (52), and experiencing a research atmosphere (8). Following the positive impression of volunteering activity, three studies found a high level of willingness (73.2-94%) among health professional students regarding participation in the future (7, 49, 53). Regarding mental issues associated with volunteering, four studies found that student volunteers had low psychological stress (40, 44, 51, 55). The prevalence of anxiety and depression was lower among volunteering students than non-volunteering ones, indicating that it positively influenced general psychological wellbeing (40, 51).",1,pandemic,True,Test

"The current COVID-19 pandemic has pushed everyone to contribute. As future healthcare providers, health professional students are regarded as those with the closest capability to assist (57). This review analyzed health professional students' willingness to volunteer in pandemics, in addition to their motivation, benefits, and obstacles to volunteering. Health professional students' desire to participate as volunteers are influenced by moral responsibility, personal interest, social dedication, prosocial motivation, self-cognition, and learning opportunities. The majority of health professional students were willing to fight the pandemic (41, 46). The previous studies in Ireland also showed that the majority of health professional students would volunteer during pandemics (58).",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"There were various reasons for health professional students' eagerness to volunteer during the COVID-19 era. A shortage of medical personnel and sense of duty were the main reasons supporting the students' willingness to volunteer (41). Gender, volunteering experience, types of academic institution, place of living, and family income had higher scores for willingness and readiness to volunteer (41, 59). Female students were more likely than male students to volunteer in pandemic control (60.2 vs. 52.3%). This finding is consistent with previous research, which found that women were more inclined to volunteer because of their nurturing, generous, and empathetic nature, but for a shorter period than male participants (60, 61). Moreover, health professional students with high prosocial motivation were more likely to engage in volunteer behavior during a pandemic crisis (42). This is in accordance with the findings from the previous studies that showed that increases of prosocial motivation lead to increases in either work or volunteering behavior (62).",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Most of the students indicated that volunteering activities provided direct benefits such as gaining a sense of giving direct aid, building professional experience, and developing collaboration skills (7). This may be due to health-related activities influencing health professional students to contribute (63). These findings are consistent with the previous studies (64-66). Thus, giving motivation to the health professional students to contribute as volunteers in this pandemic era became crucial. Another advantage of volunteering is that it helped prevent mental-health problems during this uncertain time. Volunteering was also linked to improved mental wellbeing (67).",1,flu,True,Test
"On the other hand, some barriers may be experienced by health professional students discouraging them from participating in volunteer work during COVID-19. Fear for their own health, the lack of a treatment, and the fear of",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"harming patients were key factors limiting their willingness to volunteer (41). Health profession students responded that their safety while working was a priority (45). As a result, the regulation on this topic appears to be necessary as a prerequisite (7). Fostering volunteerism among medical students requires the joint effort of the government, non-profit organizations, hospitals, and medical colleges (42). Government and alllevel organizations should contribute to create extensive job opportunities and platforms for medical students to generate volunteer services, as well as to build a sustainable incentive system to encourage medical students to engage in volunteer behavior to serve society (42). Training and education were related to update the safety recommendations (68). Hospitals should give the training sessions and theoretical prequalification before health professional students start activity in volunteering (45). The university should provide clear protocols and guidance for volunteering activities (45). Senior colleagues should further address and support safety during clinical work (45).",1,clinical,True,Test
"Health professional students can undertake many activities to contribute in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nine studies included in this review assessed the form of activities that health professional students undertook to fight the pandemic. The activities can be broadly divided into nine different categories, defined as direct patient care (7, 25, 27, 46), call center and administration (7, 27, 39, 46), epidemiological aspects (22, 47, 48), online consultation (46- 49), laboratory-related works (47), equipment supply (27, 39), mentoring juniors (39), health promotion and education (48), and in research programs (8). Some students also reported being involved in more than one type of volunteering activity, such as in patient's triage and admission wards (7, 39). This is important in increasing public knowledge and awareness, supporting healthcare facilities, and evidence-based practice regarding the COVID-19 pandemic (7, 17, 69).",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Our work provides an exclusive systematic review of volunteering activities undertaken by health profession students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we evaluated the determining factors, types of activities, and advantages of volunteering (which was exclusively done in this systematic review). Moreover, this study employed a larger population of health professional students (medical and other healthcare professions) than previous research (only inclusive of medical students) (70).",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"There are some limitations found in this systematic review. The number of samples was highly variable (the smallest was 12, and the largest was more than 10,000). The study with a small sample size may not represent all health professional students. Moreover, many studies had a moderate risk of bias due to their cross-sectional design (attributed to insufficient observation) and lack of confounder adjustment. The heterogeneity of the outcome measures changed the pattern of this review. Due to large geographical distribution, there may be cultural disparities among them, although it is helpful to picture a global phenomenon of volunteering in health professional students. The scope of this review is broad enough because it discusses the motivation and barriers to the willingness of health professional students to volunteer, the types of volunteering activities that health professional students can undertake, and the impact of volunteering on their future lives.

"Abstract An online cross-sectional study was carried out to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among primary health care providers (PHPs) at three tertiary care hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan. Data was collected via email and online social media platforms. Statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 25.0 was used for data analysis. Among the total participants (n,""114), 74 (66.7%) were male and 37 (33.3%) were female. The mean scores for knowledge, attitude and practice were 12.7±0.89, 8.9±4.1 and 7.3±1.2, respectively. Most of the participants knew the term COVID-19 and its mode of transmission (90%), signs and symptoms (84%) and risk factors (72%) associated with it. Most of the participants agreed that COVID-19 can be transmitted through coughing and sneezing (74.3%) and 84.6% were in favor that COVID-19 can be prevented by adopting preventive measures. Around 68.8% of the participants disagreed with the use of antibiotics in the prevention of COVID-19. Ninety percent of the respondents were avoiding close contact with the people having cough and flu-like symptoms. Most PHPs had good knowledge, positive attitude and reasonable practices regarding COVID-19. Moreover, focused training programs for PHPs at the Government level can further improve their understanding of risks and preventive strategies related to COVID-19, which will help them to provide appropriate care to their patients as well as to protect themselves from this infection.""",1,coronavirus,True,Test

The mean practice score of 7.3±1.2, suggested that the preventive practices regarding COVID-19 among the PHPs were acceptable.""",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Knowledge greatly reflects the practice of individuals as it provides a base for good practice [10]. The knowledge of PHPs regarding COVID-19 is of paramount importance as they are on the frontline in dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak. The Physicians, Pharmacists, and Nurses are the professionals who are in direct contact with the COVID19 infected patients and they must be fully aware of the associated risks with this infection. In the presented study the correct knowledge response rate was 90%, this finding was consistent with studies conducted in China (90%) [1] and Kenya (88%) [9], but was higher than that of Jordon (40%) [11]. One study from China reported that 89.5% of the participants knew COVID-19 which was in line with our study [12]. The knowledge of the Iranian general population about COVID-19 was 87% which is consistent with our study [13]. Another study from China reported that 88% of the healthcare workers knew COVID-19 (knowledge score: 8.17±1.30), this finding was in line with our study [14].",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"The present study demonstrated that most of the respondents showed a positive attitude toward COVID-19. Almost 80-90% of the respondents agreed that infection can be prevented by wearing masks, washing hands, using sanitizer and soap, restricting travel to infected areas, isolation of infected patients and avoiding touching nose, eyes, and mouth, which was consistent with studies reported from China (94%) [1] and Iran (90%) [13]. Another study from China stated that 93.3% of the participant agreed with the statements that COVID-19 transmission can be prevented by washing hands with soap frequently, isolation of COVID-19 positive patients and acceptance of isolation after getting COVID-19 (attitude score: 1.86±0.43, range: 1-4) which was in line with our findings [14].",1,positive,True,Test
"The adaption of preventive practices is the only solution to defeat the COVID-19, as to date, there is no specific treatment and prevention for the novel coronavirus [15]. In the present study preventive practice adopted by the PHPs were appreciable. The majority of respondents often practiced thoroughly cooked food (92%), keeping themselves warm and hydrated (69.6%), avoiding close contact with the people having cough and flu like symptoms (76%) and wearing personal protective equipment during interaction with COVID-19 patients (88.4%). Most of the participants had performed hand hygiene before and after interaction with COVID-19 patients (99.1%). Almost 100% practiced social distance of one meter from patients and other healthcare workers. This figure was consistent with the reported studies from China, where 96% of the respondents were practiced preventive practices by avoiding crowded places and wearing masks [1] and Jordon, where 87.5% of the participants adopted preventive practice by washing hands with alcohol or soap, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and putting a mask on confirmed or suspected patients [11]. Another study from Iran reported that 89% of the participants practiced preventive measures regarding COVID-19 (mean±SD: 32.1±2.9, range: 12-36) these numbers are consistent with our study [13].

"Abstract Implications for the academic and interpersonal development of children and adolescents underpin a global political consensus to maintain in-­classroom teaching during the ongoing COVID-­19 pandemic. In support of this aim, the WHO and UNICEF have called for schools around the globe to be made safer from the risk of COVID-­19 transmission. Detailed guidance is needed on how this goal can be successfully implemented in a wide variety of educational settings in order to effectively mitigate impacts on the health of students, staff, their families, and society. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of current scientific evidence and emerging standards in relation to the use of layered prevention strategies (involving masks, distancing, and ventilation), setting out the basis for their implementation in the school environment.

"According to the World Health Organization (WHO) ""The [COVID-­19] pandemic has caused the most catastrophic disruption to education in history.""1 As a result, educational and governmental authorities have become increasingly aware of the widespread nature of poor indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in classrooms, which epidemiologists, public health experts, and building services engineers have been sounding warnings over for decades.2-­4 Despite appeals by both the WHO and UNICEF for schools to be made safer, by adopting measures to minimize transmission of the SARS-­CoV-­2 virus, there has been little progress, by way of a coherent transnational directives, on how this should be achieved. Part of the reason that decisive action to reduce transmission in schools has been delayed may be because the factors influencing the nature of indoor transmission of SARS-­CoV-­2 were poorly understood initially, and the role of aerosol transmission was downplayed.5 It was not until 30 April 2021, more than 12months after first declaring COVID-­19 a pandemic, that the WHO formally acknowledged that the virus was airborne.6 Whilst more than 2years into the pandemic, on 23 March 2022, the U.S. White House announced for the first time that ""the most common way COVID-­19 is transmitted from one person to another is through tiny airborne particles of the virus hanging in indoor air.""7",1,pandemic,True,Test
"Overwhelming evidence of continued widespread disruption to the education of hundreds of millions of students worldwide8 coupled with the mental health, wellbeing, economic, and social impacts associated with lockdowns and school closures,9,10 has underscored the importance of decisive action to reduce in-­school transmission. Gurdasani et al.11 argue that mass infection is not an option since it risks leaving an entire generation with chronic health problems and disabilities, compounded by long-­term personal and economic impacts.",1,spread,True,Test
"It was established, during the Delta outbreak (using cluster tracing and calibrated agent-­based epidemiological models), that the control of SARS-­CoV-­2 spread in schools (as defined by R <1) requires a combination of more than one preventive measure.12,13 Understanding modes of transmission and their relative importance, in any given context, is therefore central to the implementation of effective public health interventions (Appendix S1).14 In",1,outbreak,True,Test

3 | PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND MASKS,0,,False,Test
"A number of studies have attempted to define a safe physical distance from direct transmission on the basis of the furthest distance that droplets produced by coughing can reach. The results of such studies show that environmental parameters, in particular air speed and direction, can play a significant role in influencing the distance which respiratory droplets can travel.19,20,21 Using a modified version of the Wells-­Riley model, Sun and Zhai22 determined that the minimum safe distance for regular social activities (e.g. breathing and talking) indoors was 1.6-­3 m; however, they note that occupant density, ventilation rate and effectiveness, and exposure time have a marked influence on infection probability. Moreover, in the absence of masks, it has been shown that large droplets can be transported more than 2 m by coughing and over 6 m by sneezing, under typical room temperature and humidity conditions (20 °C; 50% RH).23,24 Meta-­analysis, involving over 200 observational and comparative studies, confirms that effective protection against direct infections is provided by physical distancing (of 1 m or more) and the consistent wearing of quality-­assured face masks (at least surgical masks or medical grade mouth-­nose protection [MNP])25 along with consistent hand hygiene.",1,transmission,True,Test
"The risk of indirect infection is also significantly reduced by wearing masks, with FFP2/N95 (and FFP3/N99) grade masks being particularly effective against aerosol transmission.26,27 Cross-­sectional studies show that communities with high reported mask-­wearing and physical distancing have the highest predicted probability of transmission control.28 Other measures, such as ventilation or mobile air purifiers, do not obviate the need to wear masks during the pandemic; rather they serve to provide an additional layer of protection against indirect infections. Moreover, research shows that the efficacy of masks is non-­linear and is highly dependent on the airborne viral concentration in the room air. Using direct measurements of SARS-­CoV-­2 in air samples and population-­level infection probabilities, Cheng et al.26 determined that the viral load in most environments is sufficiently low for masks to be effective in reducing airborne transmission. To",1,mask,True,Test
"achieve this benefit, masks must always be worn correctly, that is, completely covering the mouth and nose and fitting as tightly as possible (i.e. without air gaps at the perimeter).",1,mask,True,Test
"Masks should be worn by everyone during classroom teaching, including, as far as possible, the teachers, because speaking frequently and loudly accounts for a particularly large proportion of the respiratory droplet and aerosol emissions in a room.29,30 The consequences of an unmasked teacher reading in class whilst in an infectious state were clearly illustrated in the COVID-­19 outbreak at an elementary school in Marin County, California (May 2021) where the attack rate in the front two rows (closest to the teachers desk) was 80% and in the back three rows 28%.13 For practical reasons and to minimize any negative effects on the teaching activities, teachers could alternate between wearing surgical masks and FFP2/N95 masks, depending on the specific needs of an activity and the applicable regulations.",1,Mask,True,Test
"Despite media controversy and false reporting,31 there is little data attesting to adverse effects from mask wearing in children, and when used appropriately, they are not expected.32 Moreover, research suggests that children actually tolerate mask wearing better than their parents realize.33 During school breaks, the students should be encouraged to spend time outdoors, where they can safely remove their masks. Masks should still be required in transit zones (hallways, stairwells etc.) as well as in washrooms and other confined indoor spaces. There is no evidence that mandatory masking has exerted a negative effect on social distancing between individuals when queuing or in crowded spaces; on the contrary, evidence shows that masks appear to serve as a signal to increase distancing.34 Appropriate break times outdoors should be observed because the continuous wearing of surgical masks (and even more so tightly fitting FFP2/N95 masks) can be perceived as a physiological strain.",1,mask,True,Test
"Extrapolating such findings to the outdoor setting is challenging, Rowe et al.35 developed a simplified analytical model to compare the relative level of exposure occurring between comparable (in terms of occupant density) outdoor and indoor settings. Their findings confirm that the risk of indirect transmission outdoors is typically orders of magnitude lower than that of indoors; however, they note that situations of temperature inversion and low wind speeds (i.e. those which commonly exacerbate atmospheric pollution) could result in levels of outdoor transmission close to those indoors, especially in crowded spaces.35 On the basis of these findings, it can be inferred that outside the school building (e.g. in the schoolyard), masks do not typically need to be worn provided sufficient distance is maintained (min. 1.5m). Conversely, when in close proximity outdoors (i.e. <1.5 m), masks should also be worn, to avoid direct infections; for this purpose, simple mouth-­nose coverings are sufficient.",1,transmission,True,Test
"Physical distancing should be maintained both indoors and outdoors to reduce the risks of direct transmission. The primary function served by the wearing of face masks (i.e. source control) cannot be replaced by distancing, ventilation, or air purification measures.",1,distancing,True,Test

"Morawska and Milton argue that although people may think that they are fully protected by adhering to the current recommendations, ""in fact, additional airborne interventions are needed for further reduction of infection risk.""36 In support of this assertion, evidence is now emerging from large cohort studies carried out in European schools, confirming the extent to which ventilation is able to reduce SARS-­CoV-­2 transmission in classrooms.37,38 A consistent finding from such studies is that increasing ventilation rates has a significant impact on reducing the risk of infection, with in-­ classroom transmission reduced by over 80% in one study, where six air changes per hour (ACH) were used.38 Moreover, in addition to the well-­documented effect on long-­range transmission39,40,41 there is emerging evidence that room ventilation rates significantly affect short-­range airborne transmission.42",1,transmission,True,Test
"Studies have shown that classroom CO2 monitoring and teacher education are vital to ensure that teachers understand how and when to ventilate appropriately during the pandemic.43 In well-­ mixed spaces, CO2 serves as a reliable scalar for the ambient air flow; however, it should be noted that aerosolized pathogens are subject to additional removal mechanisms, including filtration (e.g. by face masks, filtration devices and internal circulation), sedimentation, and deactivation. Therefore, the concentration of CO2 cannot be taken as an absolute measure of the SARS-­COV-­2 concentration or the risk of infection since this is also dependent on the probability that an infector is (or was) in the room and on the duration of exposure.44 As such, COVID-­19 indoor safety guidelines can be broadly expressed in terms of cumulative exposure to CO2 under the assumption that an infected person is present in the room.44,45",1,pandemic,True,Test

"respiratory aerosol exposure and associated indirect infection risks will be. From the point of view of indoor hygiene and viral transmission risks in a typical classroom (where masks are worn), a CO2 value of 1000ppm should not be exceeded on average over a teaching hour.47,48 This value can be achieved, for example, by commencing purge-­ventilation whenever the CO2 concentration reaches approximately 1200ppm CO2 until it falls below approximately 800ppm CO2.",1,respiratory,True,Test
"Such values were determined early in the pandemic, however, and on the basis of increased transmission with new (Omicron) variants, Rowe et al.49 propose that CO2 thresholds of 800ppm (when masked) and 600ppm (when unmasked) represent more appropriate targets. For practical reasons, maintaining such values may be difficult or impossible year-­round in many existing naturally and mechanically ventilated classrooms since a CO2 reduction from 1000 to 600ppm implies approximately a threefold increase in the ventilation rate, in a typical classroom. In wintertime, maintaining thermal comfort at such high ventilation rates will carry a substantial energetic penalty. For this reason, strategies providing a base level of ventilation augmented by additional room-­based air purification methods (Section 4.6) may be preferable.",1,pandemic,True,Test
"Ventilation rates only influence the dilution of suspended particles, and it is important to acknowledge that there can be orders of magnitude difference in the emission rates of aerosols entering a room according to activity levels, masking compliance, and a number of other factors.50 It should also be noted that in the absence of masks, respiratory jets from the occupants are likely to pose a substantially greater risk than the well-­mixed ambient air. For this reason, ventilation systems and air purifiers cannot obviate the need for masking and physical distancing.50,51",1,flu,True,Test

4.2 | Air distribution pattern in rooms,0,,False,Test
"School classrooms are usually rectangular, with air volumes typically in the range of 100-­300m3. During lessons, students and teachers typically remain in fixed places, so the occupant dynamics are low. Under these conditions, the risk of infection can be plausibly estimated using models that assume complete mixing of the air.55 However, there are situations that cause directed air flows which cannot be described by such general models. These include speaking loudly,56,57 coughing, and sneezing.58 In addition, room-­specific conditions including the type of ventilation system, the temperature of the surrounding surfaces, and the locations of individuals can have large effects on the localized distribution of aerosols.59 For example, it has been shown that exhaled air jets can travel further in rooms using displacement ventilation than in those using natural or mechanical mixing ventilation.60",1,,True,Test
"In naturally ventilated classrooms, incoming airflows (generated from an open window) in line with a row of seated occupants, have been shown to increase the risk of infection transmission when an infected individual is seated near to the window.59 This risk can be mitigated by using a baffle inside the open window to direct the incoming air downward to the floor, before it enters the breathing zone, which can also help reduce cold draughts during the cooler months.61 Speaking is known to generate large amounts of aerosols, and opening one or two windows next to the teacher has been proven to facilitate the rapid exit of these particles.62",1,transmission,True,Test
"Studies of mechanical ventilated classrooms show that aerosol distributions are strongly influenced by the system design and layout. Properly designed displacement ventilation systems promote vertical stratification (Appendix S3, Figure A2), allowing the warm contaminated air to be removed above the breathing zone of the occupants. In contrast, mixing ventilation distributes the air throughout the space and does not provide any potentially clean zones.63 A common finding in mechanical systems is that infectious particles disperse in the room and re-­concentrate around the return ducts and filtration unit inlets.64,65 One study, using a CFD model of a displacement ventilation system, showed that students in the back corners of the room received two to three times less particles on average than most other students in the room.65 Such findings are difficult to generalize but highlight the benefits of computationally modeling spatial flows as a means of evaluating the optimal placement of inlet and outlet diffusers, as well as the positioning of portable room filtration units.65,66",1,flu,True,Test

4.3 | Air Handling Units (AHUs) and room ventilation systems,0,,False,Test
"Air Handling Units (AHUs) and simple room-­based ventilation systems can be used to provide a continuous air exchange and replace stale indoor air, enriched with carbon dioxide (CO2) and respiratory aerosols, with fresh outdoor air. This can be achieved without necessitating the opening of windows or user interference. In view of the pandemic, the proportion of outside air should typically be set as high as possible.67 However, several studies have cautioned that raising ventilation rates in response to the COVID-­19 pandemic requires careful analysis of the growth in energy consumption to ensure indoor comfort conditions are maintained.68,69,70 Current international standards vary in regard to what is considered an appropriate fresh air supply rate for classrooms. In the US, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-­Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standard 62.1-­201971 recommends 5 L/(sperson) for classrooms and other educational facilities, while European standards (ISO 17772 1:2017, EN 16798 1:2019)72,73 recommend an air flow rate of at least 7 L/(sperson).",1,respiratory,True,Test
"According to EN 16798-­1:2019,73 there are three possible methods which may be used to determine the airflow rate per person. For example, using EN 16798-­1 Method 1, one must account for the design ventilation rate per person plus the design ventilation rate for diluting emissions from the building itself. So, assuming one is designing to meet a normal (i.e. `medium') level of occupant expectation (i.e. Category II targets, using Method 1), then 7 L/(sperson)+ 0.7 L/ (sm2) is needed if it is a low-­emitting building. Assuming there is typically one student per 3 m2 (of internal floor area), the fresh air requirement equates to 9.1 L/(sperson), that is, circa 33m3/(hperson). The lower recommendation, here, of 25m3/(hperson) represents a pro-­rata adjustment for children and adolescents, but on no account should this value be further reduced.",1,area,True,Test
"It should be noted that the abovementioned ventilation standards were conceived prior to the COVID-­19 pandemic and should therefore be interpreted as the minimum permissible ventilation requirements. In the context of COVID-­19, findings regarding optimal ventilation rates for infection prophylaxis vary considerably. Research by Dai and Zhao, using the Wells-­Riley equation, showed that ventilation rates an order of magnitude higher than existing European standards recommend are needed to ensure an infection probability of <1%.74 Pollozhani et al.,69 using a modified version of the Lelieveld model,75 demonstrated that increased ventilation rates would continue to reduce infection rates if applied at levels beyond those currently specified in European and international standards. In contrast, recent research, using a simplified model of occupant-­ exhaled pollutants, suggests that a ventilation rate of 10 L/(sperson), in line with current recommendations proposed by the WHO, provides a similar viral concentration vs distance decay profile to that found in outdoor settings.42 This finding should be treated cautiously since it is based on a theoretical room with a negligible pressure gradient and a simplified steady-­state jet model of expired aerosols.76",1,pandemic,True,Test

"The implications of infectious organisms being recirculated in school ventilation systems were first highlighted almost 50years ago during a measles outbreak in an elementary school in upstate New York.77 In situations where an AHU uses recirculated air, this must be effectively filtered78 either by using HEPA-­grade filters (E10 to H14 according ISO 29463-­179) or by combining coarser filter classes ISO ePM1 (50) and ePM1 (80), (commonly referred to as F7 and F9 filters). Filter upgrades should be undertaken in collaboration with an HVAC professional to ensure the AHU is able to overcome the additional pressure drop induced by the new filters. Properly installed, maintained, and operated air-­handling systems can effectively reduce the risk of indirect infections and provide good indoor air quality and comfort beyond the pandemic (Appendix S3).

"Purge ventilation is a manually controlled process, whereby rooms are ventilated at a relatively high rate to rapidly dilute pollutants and refresh the stale indoor air. This can be achieved by opening the windows fully and should take place in classrooms at a 20-­min interval (or less) for about 5 min' duration during the pandemic. Purge ventilation should also take place during breaks between classes (e.g. using the 20-­5-­20 rule).67,82 Ventilating only during the breaks is insufficient to maintain the hygienic targets (CO2 concentration) compatible with COVID-­19 prophylaxis.83",1,pandemic,True,Test
"An empirical monitoring study of a naturally ventilated Korean classroom demonstrated that using continuous ventilation with a reduced opening area (ratio of the opened window area to the maximum openable window area) can be as effective as purge ventilation. In a double-­sided (i.e. cross-­ventilation) configuration, with a 15% opening area, it was possible (even during the summer months) to achieve 6.51 ACH (on average), while a single-­sided configuration, with a 30% opening area, yielded 3.28 ACH (on average). At these air-­change rates, it was determined that the infection probability in the classroom could be maintained at <1% and 2% (respectively) by restricting the exposure time to <3 h and wearing a mask.84",1,area,True,Test
"In practice, the duration of ventilation required for a complete effective air change is dependent upon the number, size, and position of the window openings as well as the building design and the outside temperature.

Curtius et al. showed that the aerosol concentration in a classroom was reduced by more than 90% within <30min when running four HEPA purifiers in tandem, with a clean air delivery rate (CADR) of 5.5 h-1.94 However, mobile air purifiers have the fundamental disadvantage that they do not lead to a renewal of the room air. They can, therefore, only serve as an additional supportive measure to reduce the aerosol-­borne risk of infection but cannot replace other measures such as ventilation and mask-­wearing.",1,mask,True,Test
"In order for mobile air purifiers to be used, it is essential that their effectiveness, with regard to reducing virus contamination in a real room, is independently verified according to official standards, such as the German norm VDI EE 4300-­1495 (established under the direction of the German government to provide independent and verifiable measurement standards for mobile air purifiers). This is a critical point since Küpper et al. found that the CADRs in real settings can be significantly lower than those determined in standardized test chamber experiments, which they attributed to the differing size distributions between actual and standard test aerosols used in some international standards.96 In addition, air purifiers must be appropriately sized, properly set up, correctly installed, and operated,97 while a number of authors have emphasized the need to replace or clean the filters with a frequency higher than that indicated for ordinary use.97,98 Moreover, filters need to be disposed as medical waste, or thoroughly disinfected, to prevent secondary contamination.98 Similar to AHUs and extract fans, the operational noise pollution and draughts from mobile air purifiers must also be taken into account and kept to a minimum (Appendix S2).94",0,,False,Test

"also be proven effective against SARS-­CoV-­2. In the context of classrooms, UV-­C devices have the major advantage of being silent, but unlike mechanical systems with air filters, they do not lead to a reduction in fine dust pollution in the room. The use of UV-­C devices is not yet established in schools however, and it must be convincingly demonstrated that occupant exposure levels do not exceed the ICNIRP guideline limits.99 A further concern arises in relation to the photochemical activation of a wide range of molecules present in the indoor environment (e.g. VOCs) by UV-­C light, which could potentially cause health effects, even in low concentrations. Precise test specifications for UV-­C secondary units can be found in the German norm DIN-­TS 67506 TS104 and for other types of mobile air purifiers in VDI EE 430O-­1495 (for which there are currently no international standard counterparts). The use of independently tested air purifiers can help reduce the risk of indirect infections in classrooms with limited ventilation, for example, in Category 2 rooms (Appendix S4) as defined by the German Environment Agency.48 In practical terms, this applies to any room where the CO2 concentration cannot be significantly lowered (to 800ppm or below) within a short period of time even with the windows open. This includes rooms with restricted window openings and where windows are not opened regularly due to factors such as excessive external noise.48",1,,True,Test

However, the repeated use of mechanically nebulized H2O2 and HOCl in indoor rooms in which people live, work, and study is not established. The German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) and the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) have strongly advised against spraying these substances in normally occupied indoor spaces. The release of other oxidizing agents such as chlorine dioxide (ClO2), hydroxy radicals (OH), and ozone (O3) is also considered questionable.

"By combining the above-­mentioned prophylactic measures to create a ""layered strategy"" and by consistently implementing and monitoring them, the risk of infection from classroom-­based teaching in schools can be significantly reduced. Evidence shows that mask wearing alongside social distancing and ventilation can create a strong trifecta effect in reducing both long-­ and short-­range infection risks inside classrooms. Ventilation methods that meet or exceed current international guidelines for the provision of fresh air and the removal of contaminants via natural or mechanical ventilation are fundamental to this approach, but their successful implementation requires continuous CO2 monitoring and due consideration to thermal and acoustic comfort criteria. Mobile air-­purifiers can significantly augment the benefits of ventilation, but they cannot replace the aforementioned trifecta. Emerging technologies such as Far-­UVC are likely to provide significant further prophylactic benefit once their safe deployment in classrooms has been established and have the added benefit of not increasing the heating demand.",1,mask,True,Test
"The risk of infection changes with the introduced viral load and has to be reassessed regularly with regard to the general infection incidence and in relation to the emergence of new viral variants. Therefore, regular testing and contact tracing are needed to inform the appropriate implementation and fine-­tuning of the prophylaxis measures. The precise level of infection or morbidity risks which are considered acceptable, in the context of keeping schools open, must be continually re-­evaluated in relation to both the educational benefits and the wider impacts on society as a whole. The multi-­layered strategy of infection prophylaxis, presented here, can be readily adjusted in accordance with the overall effectiveness, compliance with the core protective measures (masks, ventilation, and distancing), and the need for additional measures such as testing, vaccination, and contact reduction.",1,contact,True,Test

"Abstract SARS-­CoV-­2 has been detected both in air and on surfaces, but questions remain about the patient-­specific and environmental factors affecting virus transmission. Additionally, more detailed information on viral sampling of the air is needed. This prospective cohort study (N ,""56) presents results from 258 air and 252 surface samples from the surroundings of 23 hospitalized and eight home-­treated COVID-­19 index patients between July 2020 and March 2021 and compares the results between the measured environments and patient factors. Additionally, epidemiological and experimental investigations were performed. The proportions of qRT-­PCR-­positive air (10.7% hospital/17.6% homes) and surface samples (8.8%/12.9%) showed statistical similarity in hospital and homes. Significant SARS-­CoV-­2 air contamination was observed in a large (655.25m3) mechanically ventilated (1.67 air changes per hour, 32.4-­421L/s/patient) patient hall even with only two patients present. All positive air samples were obtained in the absence of aerosol-g­ enerating procedures. In four cases, positive environmental samples were detected after the patients had developed a neutralizing IgG response. SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA was detected in the following particle sizes: 0.65-­4.7 m, 7.0-­12.0 m, >10 m, and <100m. Appropriate infection control against airborne and surface transmission routes is needed in both environments, even after antibody production has begun.""",1,transmission,True,Test

"Increasing scientific evidence indicates the dominance of short-­and long-­range airborne transmission of SARS-­CoV-­2.1-­6 The observed transmission risks have been higher indoors than outdoors,7 and discussion on precautions for hospital and home environments has been intense. In a study that aerosolized SARS-­CoV-­2 under laboratory conditions, aerosols' infectivity was retained for up to 16h,8 while another study estimated the half-­life in aerosols to be approximately 1.1-1­ .2 h (95% CI 0.64-­2.64).9 Outside of the laboratory, signs of viable SARS-­CoV-­2 in the air have been detected,10-­12 and the virus has also been cultured from exhaled air.13 A direct link between SARS-­CoV-­2 viral load, emission, and airborne concentration was recently demonstrated by Buonanno et al.14 A few studies have detected SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA in the air at home-­environment.15,16 In hospitals, PCR-­based studies have found SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA in room air,17-­25 as well as from air conditioning filters located over 50m from the patient room.26 Even though previous studies have mainly used long collection times or high flow rates, challenge is that only a proportion of the air present in a room can be analyzed. Additionally, indoor turbulence highly affects local concentrations.27,28 Thus, questions remain about the risk of infection during shorter meetings or in rooms with a larger air space, and whether the findings would be similar in the home environment. As environmental sampling is highly demanding and sample sizes rather small, more patient data are also needed to draw further conclusions in future systematic reviews.",1,transmission,True,Test
"According to laboratory studies, the stability of SARS-­CoV-­2 on surfaces varies depending on the surface type and environmental conditions.9,29-­32 However, its ability to sustain infectivity on surfaces outside laboratory conditions is largely unknown.33 SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA has been found, for example, on high-­touch surfaces, floors, and toilets,18,19,34,35 and there are a few possibly positive culture findings of SARS-­CoV-­2 from the surfaces.36-­38 The effect of age and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) on the spread of SARS-­CoV-­2 has been speculated,39-4­ 1 but there is a lack of clear evidence for the role of patient-­related factors.",1,positive,True,Test
"This study sought to increase knowledge of SARS-­CoV-­2 transmission in different environments by analyzing air, surface, and patient samples from a COVID-­19 cohort ward in Helsinki University Hospital (HUS), Finland, and from patients' homes. The aims were to determine whether SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA or viable virus could be found in the home and hospital environments, and which patient-­and environment-­related factors affect the risk of environmental contamination. A team consisting of researchers from HUS, the University of Helsinki, the Finnish Meteorological Institute, and the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health was established to enable a multidisciplinary approach to the above research questions.",1,transmission,True,Test

"We performed 23 sample collections in HUS and 7 collections in patients' homes in the Uusimaa region, Finland, between July 2020 and March 2021. During the collection period, the COVID-­19 incidence in the Uusimaa area was 1-­180 cases/100000 inhabitants/7days (average 61 cases/100000 inhabitants per week) and the test positivity rate varied between 0.1% -­ 4.5%.62 Collections included 56 patients of which 31 were index patients (1-2­ per collection, see Methods for details), 21 of whom were treated on a COVID-­19 cohort ward in a large patient hall, one in a single-­patient room, one in the intensive care unit (ICU), and eight patients treated in their homes (Figure 2).",1,area,True,Test
The cohort ward had an air volume of 655.25m3 (height 4.5 m) and was provided with clean 100% outdoor supply air of 421L/s generating 1.67 air changes per hour (ACH) and 32.4-4­ 21L/s/patient depending on the number of patients. The mechanical ventilation type in the ward,0,,False,Test
"was displacement ventilation. The amount of supply air was increased before 16.3.2021 to further prevent staff infections. This change generated a higher 2.99 ACH for the last measurement (patient 56, P56). The single room in the ward had displacement ventilation with 100% outdoor supply air generating 4.7 ACH. The ICU room had a laminar inlet area in the middle of the room generating 20.52 overall ACH, and an outlet on the side of the room. All the air was filtered with HEPA13 before entering the room. The measured patient located partly under the laminar area. All measured home environments had automated mechanical ventilation, which is normal in Finland. The measured rooms were circa 15-­30m2 in area with a normal room height of 2.5 m. We were not able to measure the exact ACH at homes, but it is expected that they followed building regulations which recommend 0.5 ACH for homes.

Although five hospitalized patients (index patients P6, P7, P48, P56, and non-­index patient P5) used nasal canula oxygen or an oxygen mask during collection, which are considered aerosol-­generating procedures (AGPs), no positive samples were found during these collections.

"This study detected considerable SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA contamination from both home and hospital environments. The virus was found in the air in particle size ranges of 0.65-­4.7 m, 7.0-­12.0 m, >10 m, and<100m in diameter (Table 2), supporting existing literature.17,19,20,22 Our findings also support discoveries that normal respiratory activities generate infective particles even in the absence of AGPs,2,6,64,65 and respiratory symptoms. Additionally, low oxygen saturation showed a connection with a higher possibility of SARS-­CoV-­2 surface findings and a potential connection with air findings, which could follow from increased particle generation due to respiratory stress. Most (83%, 15/18) of our positive air samples with known particle size were in particles smaller than 4.7 m, which supports the findings that at least 85% of the viral load is emitted in aerosols smaller than 5 m.6,20,66 This is in line with the fact that particle generation produces a distribution which form depends on the activity that is causing the particles. In human respiratory activities, generated particles are mainly small, under 5 m in dry size distribution.67,68",1,respiratory,True,Test
"A previous study showed that a high sampling flow rate increases the success rate in detecting SARS-­CoV-­2 from air samples.21 When 50L/min air samplers were used, no positive samples were detected, but when sampling flowrate was raised to 150L/min 72% of samples were positive.21 In our study, SARS-­CoV-­2 was detected from the air with a minimum collection period of 10 min (Andersen's impactor) and a minimum air volume of 72L (Button sampler). With an average respiratory rate of 14/min and volume of 0.5 L/breath, this would mean exposure times of 40min (Andersen) and 10 min (Button) for the examined virus variants (alpha and undetermined VoC (Andersen), as well as non-­VoC (Button)). Current safety guidelines use 15min exposure time regarding contact tracing.69 Our results, although limited due to the low number of collections and only qRT-­PCR findings, support concerns that a shorter exposure time should be considered, at least for close contacts.70 Overall,",1,positive,True,Test

"the exposure risk is cumulating with time and no limit to zero risk can be determined. The risk for infection depends on the concentration exposed to (depending on ventilation and produced quanta) as well as persons immunity.27,71-­73 Virus variants such as the delta and omicron variants seem to lower the exposure time needed for infection, following estimated higher viral load in the presence of the delta variant74 and increased transmissibility of omicron variants possibly due immune evasion.75,76 Also, already low infectious doses have been shown to cause infection in an animal model.38,77 A previous study did not observe significant differences in environmental contamination prevalence or Ct values between alpha and omicron B.1.1.529, which could further point toward a higher receptor binding affinity and immune escape properties of omicron variant78 and enable the use of studies carried out with previous variants also when evaluating the environmental burden of newer variants.",1,infectious,True,Test
"Our results from respiratory activities demonstrated that 0.5-­2 min of activity did not produce enough virus to be detected with qRT-­PCR with this methodology, even from a close distance of 10 cm. However, it should be noted that the open deposition collection method for both respiratory activities and passive air (deposition) samples is highly dependent on the success of the impactation and the flow field near the collection surface,79 being susceptible for example to head movements and indoor air flows. Still, a quite high proportion (11.5%) of passive air samples was positive for SARS-­ CoV-­2 RNA. This supports the role of aerosol particle deposition as a source to surface contamination as previous studies have suggested.17,80 The deposition offers more gentle collection method and possibility to collect directly to the cells or cell media possibly allowing more viral preservation compared to active sampling. This could at least partly explain why viral findings were seen in our work and in previous work17 when active aerosol samples remained negative.",1,respiratory,True,Test
"Multiple positive air samples were collected from a large (655.25m3) mechanically ventilated hospital hall (Figure 1), even when there were only two patients. Overall, larger spaces are considered safer than small ones due to the larger air volume per person.81 However, it seems that also larger indoor spaces may form a risk environment if occupied by an infected person for a prolonged time period.82-­84 In our study, all patients in the ward were COVID patients. However, in many countries, COVID-­positive patients have been separated from COVID-­negative ones with just curtains and distance. As hospital-­acquired infections have been a significant part of overall infections and deaths,85-8­ 7 it is important to reduce the risk of infections in hospital wards. It should be noted that the infective aerosol particles may still generate an infection risk even when larger space allows more dilution with increasing distance, as shown by Karan et al.88 Our findings were mainly from a close distance similar to a previous study that saw higher probability to environmental findings inside 2-­meter range,24 even though the risk for infection especially in prolonged exposure remains also further away.27,28",1,positive,True,Test
It is interesting that the proportion of the positive samples was similar in hospital and home even when the ventilation was more efficient in the hospital and patients have later symptom day. This may be due to more patients in the same room or higher overall viral load,1,positive,True,Test

In earlier studies, higher viral loads have been associated with an increased probability of viral transmission.91,92 Possible reasons for the relationship between age and infectivity include reduced saliva production, differences in mucus viscosity and salivary immunoglobulins,93 increased expression of the ACE2 receptors needed for cell entry of SARS-­CoV-­2,94 thinning of the epithelium,95 and impairment of the immune response with age.96",1,disease,True,Test

Other more frequently qRT-­PCR-­positive surfaces included highly touched personal items, hospital equipment, and the floor, which is in line with the previous findings.18,19,34 Even though RNA may persist on surfaces for some time, RNA findings most likely result from contamination on the same day due to daily cleaning.",1,positive,True,Test
"The building body of evidence supports airborne route predominance for SARS-­CoV-­2 transmission,1-­4,14 and an animal study indicates that aerosol inoculation is a more efficient route and causes more severe pathology and higher viral loads.100 Fomites have not been proven to serve as the sole or primary vehicle of transmission.101 The probability for surface transmission is estimated to be likely rare, generally less than 1 in 10 000, and the disease manifestation milder.102 The environmental samples that commonly presented infectious virus in previous studies were mainly in direct contact with infected patients' mucus membranes, or saliva or sputum secretions (e.g., nasal prongs, nasal canula, used tissue, patients mask, and endotracheal tube).25,38 In this study, families that took protective measures (including isolation of the infected family member) and respiratory protection (surgical masks or FFP2 respirators) were able to prevent further infections even when qRT-­PCR-­positive samples were collected from both surfaces and air. However, in a household where all surfaces were cleaned many times a day but no respiratory protection was used, all family members became infected. This supports the importance of air hygiene, including also portable air cleaners as a supportive method as shown in previous studies,15,28 and also encourages control of infection spread in homes. Similar findings supporting the use of masks, isolation with closed door, and opening windows in home environment were found to lower the risk of contamination in the work of Picard et al.103 Overall our results indicate that transmission may happen through several transmission routes as supported also in previous systematic review.20 Infection control is even more important with VoC strains that feature a higher rate of household transmission.104",1,transmission,True,Test

"serum samples. SARS-­CoV-­2 was cultured from saliva during symptom Days 2-­11.42 SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA was detected in the saliva of patients who had already formed IgG and NAbs, which align with previous findings of prolonged RT-­PCR-­positivity.105-­107 In addition, the saliva of P16 on symptom Day 11 was still positive in virus culture, even though the patient had NAbs. Moreover, we obtained positive air and surface samples when the index patient had a positive IgG result and NAbs, which agrees with the findings of Lei et al.108 This contradicts the suggestion that NAbs solely could be a reliable marker for non-­infectivity78. In the view of infection control, we agree with Lei et al.,108 Tan et al.109 and Wölfel et al.110 that the risk for exposure can remain after the patient starts to seroconvert and possibly improve clinically. As seroconversion seems an unreliable marker for viral clearance, other means, such as an antigen test, should be used to assess the infection risk before ending precaution protocols.111,112",1,positive,True,Test
"Showing viable virus from environmental is highly demanding. Previous studies have presented a few possibly positive findings.10-­13,36-­38,66 However, the findings of those studies have been under criticism as none of them has been able to show clear CPE with significant decrease in Ct values leaving questions if the CPE was truly induced by SARS-­CoV-­2. Despite the culturing attempts of all 258 air samples and 212 surface samples, we were unable to detect viable virus from the environment. Also, only 20% of qRT-­PCR-­positive saliva samples of symptomatic patients were positive in cell culture. We did several attempts to optimize the culture protocol (Supplementary Methods) and performed qRT-­PCR on culture media whenever the slightest sign of CPE was detected. Explanations for our negative results are that there was no infectious virus in the environment at the time of the samplings or that current methods were not sensitive enough to detect it. As SARS-­CoV-­2 is efficiently transmitted in hospital wards and between family members,113,114 even from quarantine room to another via corridor and similarly timed door opening,115 we conclude that the methodology is likely too unsensitive.116 A significant loss of infective viruses in air sampling has also been demonstrated,117-­123 and current impaction and impingement sampling methods have low collection efficiency for small, nanometer-­sized particles.121,122 Sousa et al. managed to show SARS-­CoV-­2 related PFU findings with electrostatic air sampler, which may provide a more gentle collection method, however, even they observed rapid and significant inactivation of the virus during collection.12 The absolute collection efficiencies of the samplers are unknown and should be addressed in future research.123 Even though detection of viral RNA in the air and on the surface does not necessarily mean an infectious virus, negative culturing results do not rule out the infection risk either. Due to these difficulties and the high transmission rates, we consider already RNA findings to be interpreted as a possible infection risk. In the future, sampling methods and devices should be developed to better preserve the viability and infectivity, for example mimicking the humidity and airflow of the airways to avoid mechanical stress and utilizing direct collection onto the cells or culture medium to avoid losses during transport.

"Overall, this study combined a large number of environmental samples and detailed patient data to more comprehensively understand environmental contamination and the effect of patient-­ dependent factors. The patient material was representative regarding symptoms and laboratory results for COVID-­19.125 In addition to the hospital environment, we collected samples from homes where symptoms are generally less severe, the time from the onset of symptoms is shorter, and air conditioning is different from that of a hospital. Recent findings suggest that the environmental contamination is rather similar between the first variants and omicron,78 suggesting that the results from the earlier variants can still be considered to provide valid information for the current situation.",1,,True,Test
"Our study also has some limitations. Even though the overall number of our samples is quite high compared to previous studies, it is still limited in the statistical aspect and only able to detect major differences and associations. As environmental sampling is time consuming and resource intensive, making it challenging to achieve a statistically large enough sample size, it is important to combine findings from several different studies for more detailed analysis. We only conducted environmental sampling at a single time point. In the future, a longitudinal examination could enable a more accurate examination of the effects of the course of disease for environmental contamination. The mean time from the onset of symptoms until sampling varied between homes and hospital and may affect the results. However, as the infection requiring hospital treatment is more severe, the viral loads may stay high longer,112,126 and accordingly, no major differences were detected in viral load in saliva in our study between homes and hospital patients. This would provide rather similar expectation for environmental contamination as Buonanno et al examined.14 Also, patients generally arrive to the hospital at the later stage of the disease (excluding hospital-­acquired infections that were not detected in this dataset) which makes our dataset suitable to represent the real situation between homes and hospitals. In addition, we only measured the IgG and NAb response, but viral secretion from mucus membranes can continue if the IgA response is weak.127 The IgA immune response should thus be examined further in upcoming studies. The qRT-­PCR results might include some uncertainty due to the differences in the texture and fluidity of saliva and should be considered as estimates. As many samples were collected from a large patient hall, it is possible that some observed viruses might have originated from other than the index patient. However, most of the surface samples were from patient-­specific surfaces, and aerosols are known to concentrate near the source,71 indicating that most of the positive samples are expected to be produced by the index patient. Particle size cutoffs in Andersen samplers might be slightly higher than estimated, as the amount of liquid used in the sampling was slightly smaller than recommended due to practical reasons.

"Aim: Inhaled nitrous oxide is a common form of procedural sedation in paediatric care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about potential aerosol generation and associated viral transmission to health-care workers have led to controversy regarding its use. We aimed to measure the degree of aerosol generation during continuous flow nitrous oxide sedation to inform future guidelines. Methods: Aerosol numbers in the respirable range were measured using a particle counter during 30 procedures undertaken in children under nitrous oxide sedation in the Emergency Department. Results: Changes from baseline measurements were greatest in particles in the 0.3 m range. The mean increase from baseline in 0.3 m particles per cubic metre was 18 022 (95% confidence interval (CI) 5949-30 096) after the child entered the room, and 2931 (95% CI À4407 to 10 269) during nitrous oxide administration. Conclusion: Variation of respirable particle numbers from baseline levels was no greater during nitrous oxide administration than for breathing and talking asymptomatic children. These results suggest the additional risk of airborne viral transmission to staff during inhaled nitrous oxide sedation is low.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"Inhaled nitrous oxide (N2O) is a common agent used for procedural sedation in paediatric practice across a range of subspecialties including Emergency Medicine, Oncology and Radiology.1 Concerns about aerosol transmission of viral particles to health-care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the use of N2O being curtailed by a number of professional bodies and institutions. In the absence of specific evidence, this recommendation was based on concurrent guidelines for high-flow oxygen therapies, in addition to evidence that infected",1,transmission,True,Test

"Respiratory particles range from 0.5 to 20 m in diameter, with the larger droplets (>20 m) likely to fall directly to the ground, smaller droplets (5-20 m) falling more slowly, and the smallest particles (<5 m) more likely to be suspended in the air for a longer period.7 These droplet nuclei (or aerosols) are more likely to be inhaled and reach the lower respiratory tract.7 The risk of transmission of viruses from larger particles is likely to much greater due to their greater volume and therefore higher viral load, but are relatively more avoidable in medical settings by use of contact and droplet precautions.",1,Respiratory,True,Test

"as any procedure that `results in an infectious aerosol beyond that which would normally be released by a patient coughing, breathing, or talking, presenting an increased risk to any HCW in proximity to the patient'.7 There is little doubt that symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection can create aerosols with viable virus,9 and that AGPs should be avoided in these patients. However, despite routine symptom screening of patients, there are concerns of potential risk from performing AGPs in asymptomatic but nonetheless infectious patients.",1,infectious,True,Test
"Following the previous SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, a systematic review of transmission events to HCW who were most likely protected only by contact and droplet precautions demonstrated a statistically significant association with tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, tracheotomy and manual ventilation before intubation.6 A statistically significant transmission risk was not found for other procedures such as manual ventilation, endotracheal aspiration, suction of body fluids, bronchoscopy, nebuliser treatment, administration of oxygen, high flow oxygen, manipulation of oxygen or BiPAP masks, defibrillation, chest compressions, insertion of nasogastric tube, chest physiotherapy and collection of sputum.6 However, since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, almost all of those procedures have been included in lists of AGPs, including procedures appearing similar to high-flow oxygen such as N2O sedation. This has an impact not only on the usage of precious high-grade PPE, but also on patients whose care is altered by the consequent changes in practice.",1,epidemic,True,Test
"Other medical craft groups have sought to determine the aerosol risk of their normal practice more accurately, as the exclusion of aerosol generation by specific procedures should allow them to be safely continued with contact and droplet precautions during respiratory pandemics.

While some devices and procedures",1,contact,True,Test
"designed to reduce aerosol exposure have shown greater risk on empiric testing,13 some procedures that were initially avoided due to theoretical risks have been demonstrated to be low risk.10 Fortunately for paediatric practice, children appear to have a lower risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and when infected seem to be less infectious to others than they are with other viruses,14 possibly due to differences in tissue expression of receptors.15 However, theoretical risks in paediatric practice have still been stated in relation to nebulised medication, high-flow oxygen therapies, intubation, and inhaled N2O administration. The often unpredictable behaviours of children, including crying or shouting, are also considered a factor that might increase the risk of aerosol generation.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"In our study, the particle counts that HCW were exposed to during N2O administration were no greater than, and possibly lower than, an unmasked talking child. Higher particle levels during the procedure phase most likely represent movement of staff, and plaster dust in some cases, as particle levels fell again during the washout phase. These results appear to confirm that our longstanding practice of using a close-fitting facemask and gas scavenging during the use of continuous flow N2O act to prevent an increase in aerosol levels. HCW should therefore be safe in administering inhaled sedation in asymptomatic patients by this method without the need for aerosol precautions.",1,mask,True,Test

Conclusions,0,,False,Test
Use of continuous-flow nitrous oxide for paediatric procedural sedation in our cohort generated no more aerosol particles than a child who was breathing and talking. It also produced aerosols at least 4 orders of magnitude less than nebulisation therapy. This suggests that nitrous oxide sedation delivered by continuous flow with a close-fitting cushion facemask and gas-scavenging has a low risk of aerosol viral transmission to health-care workers in the event that the child has a subclinical viral infection. Similar techniques could be employed in future to determine the aerosol-generating potential of other clinical procedures.,1,mask,True,Test

"Since December 2019, some hospitals in Wuhan have been suffering from pneumonia of unknown causes, later identified as a COVID-19 by the whole genome sequence analysis of the viruses in the respiratory samples from the patients (5). This coronavirus belongs to the  genus, which was named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (6, 7). Most of the initial cases had a history of exposure to the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan city, and some cases rendered a family clustering feature. The source of infection is still unknown, however it is speculated that the infection may have been caused by bats or vipers (8). The infection is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets. The median time from onset to admission to the hospital was 9 days, and most patients were between 40 and 60 years-old. The clinical manifestations are mainly fever, fatigue, and dry cough, with gradual dyspnea in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe cases (2, 3, 9). In this case, the patient had no clear history of contact with the epidemic area, and both the leukocytes and lymphocytes were normal, thus it was misdiagnosed as common pneumonia at first.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"In this case, the initial CT showed GGOs in the right lower lobe, the pathology of which may represent pulmonary edema or hyaline membrane formation (4). The density of the lesions is so subtle that it can hardly be depicted by conventional radiographs. Therefore, routine CT examination is recommended for the patients suspected of COVID-19",1,case,True,Test
"to reduce missed diagnosis (1). CT findings of this patient include the short-term progression of lesions, multiple patchy consolidations and GGOs in both lungs, especially in the peripheral lung zones of the lower lobes, which may represent alveolar injury, cellular and fibrous exudation. After treatment, the consolidations and GGOs were almost absorbed, leaving fibrous cord-like shadows that represent fibrosis.",0,,False,Test
"In conclusion, we report the serial CT findings in a female patient with COVID-19. Chest CT showed rapidly developing multiple patchy consolidations and GGOs in both lungs, which were mainly distributed in the peripheral areas. In the later stage, there may be a possibility of development of fibrosis. And with high-resolution CT, it will be easier to find GGOs in the early stage. The imaging findings of COVID-19 overlap with other viral pneumonia, therefore, nucleic acid tests are recommended for prompt diagnosis and treatment.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"In great metropoles, there is a need for a better understanding of the spread of COVID-19 in an outdoor context with environmental parameters. Many studies on this topic have been carried out worldwide. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the influence of environmental variables on the transmission, hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19, even though there are plausible scientific explanations that support this, especially air quality and meteorological factors. Different urban contexts, methodological approaches and even the limitations of ecological studies are some possible explanations for this issue. That is why methodological experimentations in different regions of the world are important so that scientific knowledge can advance in this aspect. This research analyses the relationship between air pollution, meteorological factors and COVID-19 in the Brussels Capital Region. We use a data mining approach that is capable of extracting patterns in large databases with diverse taxonomies. Data on air pollution, meteorological, and epidemiological variables were processed in time series for the multivariate analysis and the classification based on association. The environmental variables associated with COVID-19-related deaths, cases and hospitalization were PM2.5, O3, NO2, black carbon, radiation, air pressure, wind speed, dew point, temperature and precipitation. These environmental variables combined with epidemiological factors were able to predict intervals of hospitalization, cases and deaths from COVID-19. These findings confirm the influence of meteorological and air quality variables in the Brussels region on deaths and cases of COVID-19 and can guide public policies and provide useful insights for high-level governmental decision-making concerning COVID-19. However, it is necessary to consider intrinsic elements of this study that may have influenced our results, such as the use of air quality aggregated data, ecological fallacy, focus on acute effects in the time-series study, the underreporting of COVID-19, and the lack of behavioral factors.",1,spread,True,Test

"Air quality is an intensively analyzed topic in scientific research. It has impacts on human health, the environment, and ecosystems. These impacts are mainly observed in big cities, where one finds the primary emission sources of air pollution and higher population densities. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and particulate matter (PM) are emitted through combustion, and the most significant emission sources of these pollutants are urban motorized traffic, household emissions, and industrial processes (Wark and Warner, 1976). These pollutants are presumed to contribute to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has brought numerous challenges to the current human population worldwide (Li et al., 2020; Curtis, 2021; Vali et al., 2021; Zoran et al., 2022). The people of big cities are especially vulnerable to the risk of getting infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) (WHO, 2021). This is primarily due to the higher population density, which facilitates direct transmission by inhaling droplets containing SARS-CoV-2 (Ali et al., 2021; Oztig and Askin, 2020). But research conducted in China, Italy, England, the United States, etc. also suspects that air-borne transmission of COVID-19 is a possible pathway for infections of big city inhabitants and that acute and chronic exposure to air pollution could play a significant role in COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions, ICU admissions, case fatality rates, mortality, prevalence and incidence (Zhu et al., 2020; Conticini et al., 2020; Setti et al., 2020; Travaglio et al., 2021; C.

"There are three known ways infectious exposure to respiratory fluids carrying SARS-Cov-2 can lead to a new infection: (1) the inhalation of air carrying very fine droplets and aerosol particles (<9 m) containing SARS-Cov-2, (2) deposition of large droplets (>20 m) onto the exposed mucous membrane and (3) touching infected inanimate surfaces followed by getting into contact with the mucous membrane (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC, 2021). Although the second way has been established as the most common for COVID-19 infections, there is growing evidence concerning the first way of exposure. Droplets are released during the exhalation of an infected individual. The larger droplets settle to the ground after an approximate distance of 1,5 m, but the fine and air-borne droplets, which are also released through exhalation, shrink through evaporation, making them small enough to remain suspended in the air for more extended periods (from 15 min to several hours) (CDC, 2021; Van Doremalen et al., 2020). This phenomenon has been scientifically supported by some studies that have proved the aerosolization of bacteria and viruses and their long-range transport across the atmosphere while being carried by soil dust or organic aggregates in sea spray (Yamaguchi et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2010; Aller et al., 2005; Reche et al., 2018). The research of Van Doremalen et al. (2020) indicates that aerosol and fomite transmission is plausible for SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, the risk of infection by airborne transmission is higher in a closed and poorly ventilated environment than outdoors, and the infection risk decreases over time and with the distance the droplets travel. Aerosol droplets mix with the airstream and become diluted within it. In addition, there is a loss of viral viability and infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 over time due to environmental factors (e.g., temperature, absolute humidity and UV radiation) (Lim et al., 2021). Other studies found detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA on PM but concluded the concentrations were too low to represent a major transmission vector for SARS-CoV-2 outdoors (Setti et al., 2020; Chirizzi et al., 2021).",1,infectious,True,Test
"There is conflicting evidence concerning the possible correlation between air pollution and the number of COVID-19 cases. Some studies find significant correlations and others do not, and biases are present in both types of studies. For the particulate matter of <2,5 m of diameter (PM2.5), its increasing concentration has a significant positive correlation with COVID-19 cases (Curtis, 2021; Zhu et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Petroni et al., 2020). This positive correlation has also been established for particulate matter of <10 m of diameter (PM10) (Zhu et al., 2020), NO2 (Zhu et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Ogen, 2020), O3 (Zhu et al., 2020) while for SO2 results indicated a significant negative correlation (Zhu et al., 2020).

"a positive correlation but are biased due to ecological fallacy1 and possible confounding factors2 that were not considered. A review article from Villeneuve and Goldberg (2020) critiques how some studies were executed and to which biases they are susceptible. Other studies, for example, Lim et al. (2021), found no significant correlation with any air pollutant (Lim et al., 2021). Studies also found that chronic exposure to atmospheric contaminants may act as a favorable context for the spread and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 in a population that is more likely to develop respiratory and cardiac conditions (Fattorini and Regoli, 2020). Positive correlations between COVID-19 mortality and long-term exposures to PM2.5 (Travaglio et al., 2021; C. Wu et al., 2020; X. Wu et al., 2020), PM10 (Travaglio et al., 2021), NOx and O3 (Travaglio et al., 2021) support these findings.",1,positive,True,Test
"Some authors suspect PM2.5 and PM10 particles act as carriers for the virus through inertial impaction, interception, Brownian diffusion, or coagulation. However, Belosi et al. (2021) disproved the three first mechanisms but found for ultrafine particles (<0.01 m), a not yet negligible but small chance virus-laden aerosols could act as a sink for PM through coagulation. Yet, Belosi et al. (2021) also concluded from their research that the likelihood of air-borne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is very low in outdoor conditions, excluding crowded public areas. This transmission mechanism could be more relevant for indoor community environments, in which further studies are necessary to investigate the potential risks. Although, earlier studies have shown that aerosols could contain biological materials such as viruses and bacteria (Després et al., 2012) and that the infectivity of viruses could be influenced by their interaction with PM (Groulx et al., 2018). In addition, other studies had results supporting that air pollution influences the spread and contagion capacity of some viruses (Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007), such as the avian influenza virus (H5N1) (Chen et al., 2010; Horne et al., 2018), the human respiratory syncytial virus (Horne et al., 2018), or the measles virus (Chen et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2020). Next to Belosi et al., other researchers do support that the contagion and spread of SARS-CoV-2 positively correlate with air pollution. Setti et al. (2020) concluded that outdoors, a cluster could be created between PM and SARS-CoV-2 and due to the reduction of the PM's diffusion coefficient, the persistence of the virus in the atmosphere enhanced.",1,transmission,True,Test
"By looking at the possible explanations for these statistics in the scope of microbiology, one can find that air pollution is an important contributor to pro-inflammatory responses in human cells leading to an overexpression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines synthesized by alveolar macrophages (Conticini et al., 2020). This means that the air pollutants irritate a person's respiratory system and cause lung cells to produce more chemicals (i.e., cytokines and chemokines). This phenomenon triggers the immune system to activate through signals. This process has been chiefly observed with exposure to PM2.5 and PM10, causing the elevated production of interleukin IL-6 and IL-8 and other cytokines in human bronchial cells (Longhin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Pope et al., 2016). Becker and Soukup (1999) also found results that suggest alterations of the macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses to viral infection by PM10 exposure, which means that air pollution also blocks the signals from infected cells to bring white blood cells that can eliminate the infection. This may result in increased spread of pathogens and more viral pneumonia-related hospital admissions (Becker and Soukup, 1999). Exposure to PM2.5 can also lead to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD), infections in the upper respiratory system (i.e., the nose, the nasal cavity and the pharynx) and the lower respiratory system (i.e., larynx, the trachea, the bronchi and the lungs) (Xu et al., 2016). Exposures to other pollutants such as O3, SO2 and NO2 also correlate with higher IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 levels and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) (i.e., cytokines) in patients (Perret et al., 2017; Kurai et al., 2018; Che et al., 2016; Cho et al., 2007).

"Curtis (2021) analyzed the co-morbidity of COVID-19 with air pollution through bio-monitoring. Curtis (2021) found interesting results for PM2.5, CO, active smoking, incense, pesticides, heavy metals, dust/sand, toxic waste sites, volcanic emissions, and wildfires. These variables were associated with pollutant-related oxidative stress in the airways, inflammation in the lungs and other tissues, and the pollutant-driven alteration of the ACE-2 enzymes in respiratory and other cells. It has also been proven that there is co-morbidity between COVID-19 and underlying health conditions that can be developed through chronic exposure to air pollution. These conditions (i.e., hypertension, COPD, non-TH2 asthma, lung cancer, tumors, heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease, obesity, diabetes, immunodeficiencies such as complications in the early type-1 interferon secretion capacity) exacerbate COVID-19 severity (Domingo and Rovira, 2020; Horne et al., 2018; C. Wu et al., 2020; X. Wu et al., 2020; Brandt and Mersha, 2021; Gao et al., 2020; Leung et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Anastassopoulou et al. (2020) discovered that components of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 determine different severities of COVID-19 while genes related to the initial stages of infection, i.e., the binding to the cell receptors and entry, determine different susceptibilities to SARS-CoV-2 (Anastassopoulou et al., 2020). Tsai et al. even hypothesize that prolonged exposure to atmospheric pollution ""could induce persistent modifications of the immune system"" (Tsai et al., 2019).",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Meteorology is considered to directly impact air pollution (Pérez et al., 2020). Air pollutants are removed from the atmosphere through wet deposition (e.g., rainout, washout), dry deposition (e.g., sedimentation, diffusion, turbulence), or chemical reactions (e.g., oxidation) (Beckett et al., 1998). Meteorological factors are also presumed to impact COVID19 mortality. A study in over 120 Chinese cities found an association between ambient temperature and COVID-19 infections (Xie and Zhu, 2020). In addition, Cai et al. (2007) also provide results suggesting that daily average wind velocity (DAWV) was significantly associated with the SARS outbreak. They also concluded that, to some extent, that daily average air pressure (DAAP), daily average relative humidity (DARH), and daily hours of sunshine (DHS) may have influenced the outbreak as well (Cai et al., 2007). They formulated hypotheses to explain the impacts of DAWV, DARH, and DHS. High wind velocity could facilitate the dilution and removal of the air-borne droplets and thus reduce their suspension time in the air. Lower relative humidity favors the survival of enveloped SARS-CoV on inanimate surfaces and in the air. And daily hours of sunshine are directly related to exposure to ultraviolet light, which destroys virus infectivity (Cai et al., 2007; Biasin et al., 2021). For SARS-CoV-2, Bhaganagar & Bhimireddi performed a high-fidelity numerical simulation of COVID-19 case study in real-time using a HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model and found in their results that air-borne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible and that the transmission and dilution of the suspended droplets are determined by atmospheric stability regimes (i.e., low wind speed, low level of turbulence, cool moist ground conditions). These factors favor the transmission enabling the virus to survive up to 30 min and travel up to 2 km before diluting (Bhaganagar and Bhimireddy, 2020). Also, several studies found out that COVID-19 cases increase in the winter in combination with dry conditions and hypothesize this is due to the effect of the environment on viral stability, transmission, behavior change of people from outdoor activities to indoor activities, and changes in immunity levels (Moriyama et al., 2020; Brassey et al., 2020).

(2021) found predictions of higher COVID-19 mortality with low solar radiation in Manaus and drought periods in São Paulo using the classification based on association rules method.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"COVID-19 in the BCR: the concentration of NO2, PM2.5, in the BCR for whom the relation is positive and the average temperature for whom the relation is negative. The relation between COVID-19 mortality and the air pollutants PM2.5 and NO2 is also supported by the studies of Conticini et al. (2020), Setti et al. (2020), Travaglio et al. (2021), C. Wu et al. (2020) and X. Wu et al. (2020). As for the average temperature, Moriyama et al. (2020) and Brassey et al. (2020) observed that in the winter in combination with dry conditions there were more cases of COVID-19. A negative relation was also observed in the multivariate analysis between deaths from COVID-19 and average temperature. This means theoretically, in weather conditions with a lower average temperature, an increase in COVID-19 mortality can be expected. Moriyama et al. (2020) hypothesized this trend could be because of the environment on viral stability, transmission and behavioral change of people between seasons.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"The classification based on association rules observed several relations between the input and output variables. A high rate of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the BCR had a rather strong relation with a moderate vaccination rate (i.e., first shot), soft corona measures, a moderate O3 concentration, a high PM2.5 concentration, a moderate maximum temperature, a low dew point, moderate global radiation, a moderate direct horizontal radiation, a moderate average direct horizontal radiation over two weeks, a high amount of days without rain, a moderate wind speed and a high air pressure. Similar conclusions were observed between PM2.5, O3 and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the research of Zhu et al. (2020). As for the meteorological variables, dry conditions combined with moderate radiation, wind speed, and high air pressure seemed to favor the higher incidences of COVID-19 cases. Bhaganagar and Bhimireddy (2020), on the other hand, observed more serious spreads of COVID-19 in conditions with low wind speed, moderate relative humidity and low radiation. The difference in results may be related to climate-specific parameters that differ between this research in Brussels and their research in New York city. Other unknown confounding factors could also be the source of the difference. About the association with vaccination, it's known that the vaccine's effect is more effective after the second dose, and the effect of the first dose may not be very visible. Therefore, applying more vaccine doses will likely improve observed associations.",1,case,True,Test
"A high rate of new hospitalizations related to COVID-19 in the BCR had a rather strong relation with a moderate vaccination rate (i.e., first shot), strict corona measures, a moderate concentration of black carbon, a low average direct horizontal radiation over ten days and fourteen days, high global radiation, low precipitation and a low sum of precipitation over two weeks, a low to moderate absolute humidity, a high air pressure, a high wind speed, a low maximum temperature and a moderate average temperature. Here the variables of low precipitations and low to moderate temperatures support the hypothesis of increased COVID-19 cases (and hospitalizations as a result) in dry and cold conditions from Moriyama et al. (2020). Nevertheless, the relation between COVID-19 hospitalization and radiation varies and fails to provide a one-sided observation. Also, the results from wind speed conflict with the evidence found in the literature.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"A high rate of deaths related to COVID-19 in the BCR had a rather strong relation with a low vaccination rate (i.e., first shot), strict corona measures, a high PM2.5 concentration, a moderate NO2 concentration, fewer days without rain per week, low and high precipitations, a moderate sum of precipitation over a period of two weeks, a high relative humidity, a low average global radiation over a period of two weeks, a low direct horizontal radiation, a high average direct horizontal radiation over a period of two weeks, moderate average and minimum temperatures and high air pressure. The results for PM2.5 confirm their suspected influence on COVID19 mortality (Travaglio et al., 2021). For the meteorological variables, the results could not be supported by the literature but the impact of these variables on COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations can act as predictors for their association with COVID-19 deaths observed in this analysis.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"This research has brought to light some interesting results. The use of data mining techniques can provide useful insights for high-level government decision-making concerning COVID-19 and other epidemic diseases. Barcellos et al. (2021) reached the same conclusion by studying the influence of weather factors and air quality on deaths and cases of COVID-19, by data mining, in three Brazilian metropolises. The greatest strength of this study is the use of these advanced data analysis and modeling techniques. Studies like this and many others (e.g., Barcellos and Souza, 2022; Silva et al., 2022; Duarte et al., 2016) demonstrate the potential of these techniques to support public policies in urban management. However, some limitations need to be considered for the interpretation of the results of this study.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"First, for the air quality variables, data is obtained through RIO 4 × 4, this is a calculation method that aggregates data based on measuring points into data for municipalities. This means that the data per municipality cannot be considered 100 % valid. However, this method is recognized within IRCELine as a valid and reliable technique for providing federal data.",0,,False,Test
"Second, the time series studies performed in this research (e.g., multivariate analysis and CBA) focus on the acute effects of air pollution on the COVID-19 spread, hospitalization and mortality. This brings forward several biases. For one, the variance of the air pollution variables may have underlying causes that could have a greater influence on the spread and mortality of COVID-19 than air pollution on its own. For example, in periods of lockdown, the air quality in big cities improved a lot while COVID19 cases, ICU admissions and deaths dropped after a while but in what ratio the reason for the drop the COVID-19 cases, ICU admissions and deaths can be attributed to the decrease in air pollution is still unknown.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Third, the research is victim of ecological fallacy. In epidemiology, this is the failure in reasoning that arises when an inference is made about an individual based on aggregate data from a group (Villeneuve and Goldberg, 2020). In this research, the analyzed data was retrieved and processed in community-level and in BCR-level configurations. This does not necessarily mean that all the individual cases that formed the cases for the output data (epidemiological) were exposed to the same input data parameters (air quality, weather conditions, confounders).",1,epidemiology,True,Test

T. Mathys et al.,0,,False,Test
"of COVID-19-related deaths to other causes. Beyond, some people did not go to the hospital and preferred to take self-medication. This can affect results and also lead to underreporting.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"A fifth limitation is the exclusion of behavioral factors from the individual cases within the population. Occupation, people lacking health insurance, underlying health conditions, lifestyle, and viral load that people were exposed to were not taken into account while these factors are known to play an important role in the evolution of the spread and contagion of the coronavirus.",1,case,True,Test
"The last limitation concerns the positive associations. Even though these have been established, it is not possible to know in what ratio the associations may be attributed to the possible carrying effect of air pollutants or to the aerosolization of the viruses due to the weather conditions or to comorbidity between the variables.",1,positive,True,Test
5. Conclusion,0,,False,Test
"The environmental variables associated with COVID-19-related deaths were NO2, PM2.5, temperature, precipitation, air pressure and radiation. For confirmed cases of COVID-19, the variables with associative patterns were O3, PM2.5, temperature, dew point, radiation, precipitation, air pressure and wind speed. Environmental variables associated with COVID-19 hospitalization were black carbon, radiation, air pressure, wind speed, temperature, and precipitation. Combined, these environmental variables with epidemiological factors, can predict intervals of hospitalization, cases and deaths from COVID-19. These findings confirm the influence of meteorological and air quality variables in the Brussels region on deaths and cases of COVID-19. The data mining approach was able to identify with successfully these environmental variables to predict deaths, new hospitalizations and new cases of COVID-19 in the Brussels region. This approach can guide public policies and provide useful insights for high-level governmental decision-making concerning COVID-19.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"However, this research was prone to limitations such as the use of aggregated data, ecological fallacy, focus on acute effects in a time-series study, underreporting of COVID-19 and exclusion of behavioral factors. Especially the ecological fallacy needs to be more considered in environmental studies about public health.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Important gaps for further research are to analyze the effect of air quality and meteorological variables on the spread of COVID-19 and on the biological effects of their interaction in patients separately. Also, the inclusion of behavioral factors can bring interesting results.",1,spread,True,Test

"Methods: We searched databases from January 2010 to February 2022. We included quantitative and qualitative studies of real-world OC use in primary care. Quantitative data were transformed into qualitative themes. We used thematic synthesis informed by the Institute of Medicine domains of health care quality, and framework analysis informed by the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability framework. Strength of evidence was judged using the GRADE-CERQual approach.",1,spread,True,Test
"Results: We synthesized 63 studies from 9 countries covering 31 OC systems, 14 (22%) of which used artificial intelligence; 41% (26/63) of studies were published from 2020 onward, and 17% (11/63) were published after the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no quantitative evidence for negative impacts of OCs on patient safety, and qualitative studies suggested varied perceptions of their safety. Some participants believed OCs improved safety, particularly when patients could describe their queries using free text. Staff workload decreased when sufficient resources were allocated to implement OCs and patients used them for simple problems or could describe their queries using free text. Staff workload increased when OCs were not integrated with other software or organizational workflows and patients used them for complex queries. OC systems that required patients to describe their queries using multiple-choice questionnaires increased workload for patients and staff. Health costs decreased when patients used OCs for simple queries and increased when patients used them for complex queries. Patients using OCs were more likely",1,COVID-19,True,Test

OCs increased primary care access for patients with mental health conditions, verbal communication difficulties, and barriers to attending in-person appointments.

"Conclusions: This is the first theoretically informed synthesis of research on OCs in primary care and includes studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. It contributes new knowledge that, in addition to having positive impacts on care quality such as increased access, OCs also have negative impacts such as increased workload. Negative impacts can be mitigated through appropriate OC system design (eg, free text format), incorporation of advanced technologies (eg, artificial intelligence), and integration into technical infrastructure (eg, software) and organizational workflows (eg, timely responses).",1,COVID-19,True,Test

Background,0,,False,Test
"Online consultation (OC) systems allow patients to contact their health care provider over the internet to ask health-related questions and report symptoms [1]. Their query may then be resolved with a written response, telephone call, video consultation, or in-person visit. Many terms are used to describe this type of technology, including e-consultation, e-visit, and online triage (Multimedia Appendix 1 [2-28])--in this review, we refer to them all as online consultations. We distinguish OCs from ""symptom checkers"" [29] and other self-service systems that typically do not directly facilitate communication with a human health care provider and from patient portals [30], which may include generic email or secure messaging functionalities.",1,contact,True,Test
"OCs are considered by policy makers in many countries as a way to address the increasing workload and decreasing workforce capacity in primary care [31-36] while still meeting patient expectations and improving access [37]. However, they have the potential to exacerbate health inequities [38,39] and increase inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions [40]. Furthermore, there are widely recognized challenges in initiating and sustaining the adoption of new technologies in primary care [41].",0,,False,Test
"Although symptom checkers [29,42] and patient portals [30,43,44] have been well studied, only a small number of evidence syntheses directly relevant to OCs have been published: a systematic review of 57 articles on delivering ""e-consultation"" in primary care largely focused on generic stand-alone applications such as email and video (n,""39/57, 68%) [45]; a scoping review of """"online triage tools"""" included 13 papers, 4 of which (31%) were nonempirical (eg, opinion pieces) [46]; and a review of 17 studies of """"intelligent online triage tools"""" focused only on those that used """"artificial intelligence"""" (AI) [47].""",0,,False,Test

Moreover, OC system product design has progressed significantly to become more specialized and technologically advanced [51], with several more empirical research studies published on their use [2-11,52-64].",0,,False,Test
"Given this rapid scale-up and increase in the diversity and complexity of OCs, further insight is needed into their impact on health care quality. Previous reviews have not reported the design or implementation details of the OCs they studied [45-47] despite their importance in understanding the causal mechanisms of how they affect care outcomes [65].

We used the NASSS to capture ""a rich, contextualised narrative of technology-supported change efforts and the numerous interacting influences that help explain its successes, failures, and unexpected events"" [75]. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), which is designed for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies [76]. We scored each paper using recommended quintile percentages as cutoffs and considered any paper scoring at least 60% as of ""good"" quality [77].

Our emergent findings suggested that OCs had both positive and negative impacts and, therefore, theme descriptions were edited to be neutral (eg, safesafety and efficientefficiency).",1,clinical,True,Test
"For objective 2, we considered OC ""design"" as material properties of an OC, such as features and functionality [74], and ""implementation"" as the way an OC was introduced and used in a particular context [65]. As a design feature, we considered AI as the ability of machines to ""mimic human intelligence as characterized by behaviors such as cognitive ability, memory, learning, and decision making"" [82]. We synthesized the extracted data using framework analysis [83], which involved SD and TC reading and rereading each data extraction form and then coding them line by line independently--both deductively by using domains from the NASSS framework [74] for high-level themes and inductively by identifying additional subthemes. Through discussion, SD and TC summarized the findings into five high-level themes: condition complexity (health condition and the illness the OC is used for), technology (material properties of the OC and required knowledge for use), adopters (staff, patients, and carers expected to use the OC), organization (extent of work needed for implementation of the OC, capacity, and readiness), and wider system (policy context) [74]. Two NASSS domains--value proposition (value of the OC to the developer, patients, and health care system) and embedding and adaptation over time (learning and adaptation to changing contexts)--had limited applicability to our findings and were not included in the final synthesis. Informed by realistic evaluation [65], we considered our themes as contextual factors and identified patterns of explanations for how each led to the impacts on care quality from objective 1 (ie, ""causal mechanisms""). Where appropriate, we considered the levels of OC adoption as a mechanism for how they affected care quality [65]. We used visual mapping to identify commonalities and discordances in causal mechanisms--first within individual papers and then across papers [83]. Where there were discordances, we explored potential explanations where possible (eg, related to the study setting).",1,,True,Test

All were set in one of 9 high-income countries, with most coming from the United States (21/63, 33%) and the United Kingdom (20/63, 32%; Multimedia Appendix 4 [2-27,52-64,70-73,77,85-104]). In all, 41% (26/63) of the studies were published in 2020 or later, and 17% (11/63) were conducted after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Examples of excluded studies are those that focused on stand-alone video consultations [105], involved communication between physicians and not patients [106], and were not based on primary care [107].",1,clinical,True,Test

"In all, 83% (52/63) of the studies reported levels of OC adoption by patients and staff, of which 62% (32/52; 32/63, 51% of all studies) were described as ""low"" by the study authors [86]. OCs were adopted at a high rate in 63% (33/52; 33/63, 52% of all) of the studies [87], including high rates of adoption by certain patient groups even when overall OC adoption in the study was low [14].",0,,False,Test
"The included papers described 31 OC systems summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Multimedia Appendix 5 [2-27,52-64,70-73,85-104]. In 25% (16/63) of the papers, the OC system was described sufficiently to meet our inclusion criteria but not in enough detail to determine specific design features. Of the 31 OCs described, most (23/31, 74%) offered two-way written communication between patients and staff [88], with a few (4/31, 13%) also offering communication by video [52]. In all, 13% (4/31) did not provide functionalities for staff to reply to patients via the system (ie, one-way communication only [14]). In total, 35% (11/31) required patients to describe their queries solely via multiple-choice questionnaires (MCQs) [89] compared with 13% (4/31) that solely required patients to describe their queries using unstructured free text [56].

"In total, 54% (13/24) of MCQ-based OC systems exhibited three types of AI: (1) adapting questions they asked patients as they submitted their query in response to previous answers given (10/31, 32%) [91]; (2) prioritizing patient queries based on clinical urgency (4/31, 13%) [54]; and (3) signposting patients to an appropriate care provider based on their query, such as self-care, primary care, or emergency department (3/31, 10%) [8].

"In 46% (29/63) of the studies, OCs were perceived as increasing access to primary care services. It was easier and more convenient to make initial contact as patients could submit an OC query at any time without waiting on the phone or attending in person [14]. Once a query was submitted, patients also communicated with health professionals sooner as OCs tended to circumvent the traditional appointment-booking process [57].",1,contact,True,Test
Efficiency,0,,False,Test
"In total, 52% (33/63) of the studies suggested that the workload decreased for both staff and patients when using OCs. Patient queries were written rather than spoken, incoming phone calls to receptionists were reduced [16], and patient histories did not need manual documentation [93]. Written queries were usually more detailed than when communicated verbally and were received by health care staff asynchronously, thus providing opportunities for more objective examination and more effective triage. Consequently, patient queries could more often be directed to other services or dealt with by other staff members rather than always by physicians [3]. Combined with their remote nature, OCs also gave staff more autonomy over how their work was organized, thus providing efficiency gains such as working from home and control over how to contact a patient rather than defaulting to an in-person consultation [13]. When telephone or in-person consultations were necessary, they were more focused and, therefore, quicker as the staff member could read the patient query before contact [17]. OCs reduced the workload for patients by avoiding the need to telephone their primary care provider to make an appointment, which often entailed long queues [18], and avoiding in-person consultations when possible, which typically involved travel, waiting rooms, and organizing time off work and childcare [15].",1,contact,True,Test
"In contrast, 46% (29/63) of the studies suggested that OCs increased the workload for staff and patients. Staff described conducting OCs on top of their usual tasks [13] and dealing with them outside normal working hours [19]. They believed that, because OCs increased access to primary care, patients sought help more readily than they would have previously [17], thus creating ""supply-induced demand"" [108]. Processing OCs also created new administrative work such as filing them to EHRs and deciding whether they required input from a clinician [86]. Workload could also increase for patients if they perceived that entering their query into the OC system was more difficult than explaining it verbally [20].",0,,False,Test
"OCs decreased costs for providers in 32% (20/63) of the studies largely by reducing in-person visits, which have associated expenditures related to staffing and utilities [21].

"In all, 17% (11/63) of the studies suggested that OCs decreased staff workload when used for simple queries that were straightforward to resolve as they were more amenable to completion without needing to contact the patient directly via telephone or in person [5]. Simple queries included those related to administrative tasks, new and recurrent minor acute illnesses, prescriptions, tests, requests for advice, follow-up, and some chronic condition reviews [56]. These queries also decreased health costs as they saved clinicians time, for example, when administrative staff were able to relay messages and there was no direct contact between physician and patient [23]. In all, 11% (7/63) of the studies suggested that OCs increased staff workload and costs when used for complex queries such as those with multiple ill-defined symptoms [17]. These queries generally required verbal dialogue with and physical examination of the patient and were usually converted to telephone or in-person consultations to assess the patient further [23]. Staff felt that this duplicated the number of contacts with the patient for the same query.",1,contact,True,Test

"understand their request. This increased workload as they often had to contact the patient to obtain further information [23]. MCQs also asked questions about seemingly ""irrelevant"" symptoms, which staff were responsible for assessing and following up, diverting attention from the patient's primary concern [10]. Owing to the restrictive nature of MCQs, patients regularly adapted their responses to obtain the outcome they wanted even when it was not the most appropriate use of resources. For example, reporting their symptoms differently to obtain an in-person consultation when self-care may have been more suitable (""gaming"") [17].",1,contact,True,Test
"In all, 14% (9/63) of the studies suggested that MCQs could also decrease patient satisfaction. Reasons included the amount of work required to complete them [14], their inflexibility in obtaining the answers patients wanted from their primary care provider [9], and that they could be confusing to navigate [25].",0,,False,Test
"In contrast, 11% (7/63) of the studies suggested that, when patients could primarily report their queries using unstructured free text, it decreased staff workload and increased patient safety. This was because patients were more able to fully describe their query in sufficient detail using their own words, and clinicians did not have to request further information as often [95].",0,,False,Test
"In 10% (6/63) of the studies, two-way written communication within the OC decreased the workload for both staff and patients. The ability to reply to patients in writing meant queries could be answered and follow-up questions could be asked at times convenient to both staff and patients, avoiding lengthy telephone and in-person consultations when appropriate [55]. It was also easier to communicate complex information, for example, by sending educational materials or using preset message templates [95].",0,,False,Test
"In all, 21% (13/63) of the studies highlighted that a lack of integration between the OC system and other core software used by providers increased staff workload. Nonintegration meant that the staff had to go through multiple steps to perform a task, such as when filing an OC to a patient's EHR [21].",0,,False,Test

"Patients using OCs were more likely to be female (27/63, 43%) [70], younger (27/63, 43%) [91], and native speakers of the official language of the country they lived in (7/63, 11%) [25] and have a higher socioeconomic status (11/63, 17%) [57] than those not using OCs, thus decreasing equity. In contrast, both staff and patients felt that OCs increased access for particular groups of patients who struggled with traditional consultation methods, thus increasing equity and satisfaction with care. This included patients with mental health conditions who became anxious when speaking to health professionals on the telephone or in person (8/63, 13%) [20]; patients with verbal communication difficulties such as hearing loss who found it easier to communicate in writing (7/63, 11%) [90]; and patients with barriers to attending in-person appointments because of physical disabilities, geography, work commitments, or care responsibilities (8/63, 13%) [23].

"In all, 21% (13/63) of the studies found that the staff workload increased when providers did not integrate OCs into their normal daily workflows. For example, not scheduling time for clinicians to deal with OCs meant that they were done in addition to their normal tasks [93], and not diverting all incoming patient demand via the OC meant that different communication routes were often used for the same issue, thereby duplicating work [5]. In all, 13% (8/63) of the studies suggested that provider workload decreased if sufficient resources were allocated to implementing OCs. This included their initial setup--for example, training to enable staff to more effectively handle OCs [15]--and their ongoing processing--for example, dedicated facilities such as quiet rooms to help staff respond to OCs without distraction [55].",0,,False,Test
"In all, 8% (5/63) of the studies showed that a lack of continuity of care between patients and their known physician negatively affected patient satisfaction.

Summary of Evidence,0,,False,Test
"This review focused on how OCs affect primary care quality, as defined by Institute of Medicine domains, for patients, providers, and the wider system, as well as which factors, as specified through the NASSS framework, influence this quality. We synthesized qualitative and quantitative evidence from 63 studies conducted in 9 countries covering 31 OC systems described in detail, with wide-ranging functionalities including AI. In all, 41% (26/63) of the studies were published in 2020 onward, and 17% (11/63) were published after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our main findings were that OCs are safe and have positive impacts on care quality, including increased access to care and decreased patient costs. However, they can have conflicting impacts on provider costs, staff and patient workloads, patient satisfaction, and care equity. We found that",1,flu,True,Test

Comparison of Findings With Other Reviews,0,,False,Test
"Consistent with previous reviews relevant to OCs, we found a limited demographic of patients using OCs, leading to potential inequitable care [45,46]. We also found that the studies often did not sufficiently explore patients' perspectives of OCs in depth [46]; only 14% (9/63) of the studies used interview-based methods with an average sample size of 24.5 (SD 10.14). This hampered efforts to understand how such inequities arose.",0,,False,Test
"Contrary to previous reviews, we found that OC impacts on care quality are more complex and nuanced than previously reported [45-47]. For example, we identified mixed findings regarding their impact on workload, patient satisfaction, and equitable care. This contrasts with previous reviews, where OCs only increased [47] or had no impact [45] on workload, decreased patient safety [45,47], and increased inequity [45-47].",0,,False,Test
"These new findings for OCs may be partly explained because 76% (48/63) of the included studies had not been covered by these previous reviews. Although there was some overlap of papers (7/57, 12% of papers [45]; 7/13, 54% of papers [46]; and 4/17, 24% of papers [47]), most did not meet our inclusion criteria as they were either nonempirical (4/57, 7% [45]; 4/13, 31% [46]; and 4/17, 24% [47]), published before 2010 (26/57, 46% [45] and 2/17, 12% [47]), not based on real-world primary care (16/57, 28% [45]; 1/13, 8% [46]; and 6/17, 35% [47]), or did not meet our functional definition of an OC (39/57, 68% [45]; 2/13, 15% [46]; and 6/17, 35% [47]; eg, symptom checkers with no link to a health professional [28]).",0,,False,Test
"By focusing on design and implementation, we identified new ways in which OCs affect primary care quality. For example, we found that, by increasing access, OCs can increase staff workload by creating ""supply-induced demand"" [17,108] and that they can decrease workload by enabling more focused consultations [17]. Furthermore, as previous reviews often did not analyze the design or implementation of OCs [45-47], we identified influential factors that have not been previously described. For example, although some reviews identified increased workload when clinicians received insufficient patient information via an OC system [46], we found that this was particularly associated with MCQ-based OCs [23]. We identified",1,flu,True,Test
"that allowing patients to describe their queries using unstructured free text had the opposite effect [95] while also having a positive impact on patient safety [55].

Strengths and Limitations,0,,False,Test
"As evidenced by the range of examples in Multimedia Appendix 1, we adopted a fundamental functional definition of OCs rather than relying on the names given to them by the authors of the included studies. When combined with our comprehensive searches across multiple databases and inclusion of gray literature, we identified more empirical studies relevant to OCs than any previous evidence synthesis on the topic [45-47]. Combined with our focus on causal mechanisms, this helped us develop a new and theoretically informed understanding of OCs that has not been previously reported.",0,,False,Test
"As in all systematic reviews, our synthesis is reliant on what the study authors reported. OC features were not always described in sufficient detail to understand how they affected care quality [62]. There was also a lack of patient perspective in the studies, particularly from OC nonusers [4]. We made our literature search strategy as inclusive as possible regarding the different terms used for OCs (Multimedia Appendix 1) but, owing to their wide-ranging nature, it is possible that some papers were missed. We updated our searches between November 2021 and February 2022 to capture more recently published studies but, owing to time constraints, only 1 author (SD) screened these newer papers. This enabled us to capture studies conducted in the context of COVID-19 (11/63, 17% of all included studies).",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"This is the first theoretically informed synthesis of empirical research on OCs in primary care and uniquely includes studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. It contributes new knowledge that OCs are safe and have positive impacts on care quality, including increased access to primary care and decreased patient costs. However, they are also complex and often produce conflicting impacts on provider costs, staff and patient workloads, patient satisfaction, and care equity. Some of these are unintended and conflict with the promotion of OCs by policy makers as a way to address already increasing workload and decreasing workforce capacity in primary care [31-36]. Unlike previous evidence syntheses on the topic, we have shown that negative impacts on care quality of OCs can be mitigated through appropriate system design (eg, free text formats and two-way written communication), incorporation of advanced technologies (eg, AI), and integration into technical infrastructure (eg, EHRs) and organizational workflows (eg, timely responses). Since the advent of COVID-19, OCs have become indispensable, although further engineering and implementation research is required to realize their full benefits.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

Abstract,0,,False,Test
"Background: In the post-COVID-19 pandemic era, many countries have launched apps to trace contacts of COVID-19 infections. Each contact-tracing app (CTA) faces a variety of issues owing to different national policies or technologies for tracing contacts.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Objective: In this study, we aimed to investigate all the CTAs used to trace contacts in various countries worldwide, including the technology used by each CTA, the availability of knowledge about the CTA from official websites, the interoperability of CTAs in various countries, and the infection detection rates and policies of the specific country that launched the CTA, and to summarize the current problems of the apps based on the information collected.",1,contact,True,Test
"Methods: We investigated CTAs launched in all countries through Google, Google Scholar, and PubMed. We experimented with all apps that could be installed and compiled information about apps that could not be installed or used by consulting official websites and previous literature. We compared the information collected by us on CTAs with relevant previous literature to understand and analyze the data.",0,,False,Test
"Results: After screening 166 COVID-19 apps developed in 197 countries worldwide, we selected 98 (59%) apps from 95 (48.2%) countries, of which 63 (66.3%) apps were usable. The methods of contact tracing are divided into 3 main categories: Bluetooth, geolocation, and QR codes. At the technical level, CTAs face 3 major problems. First, the distance and time for Bluetooth- and geolocation-based CTAs to record contact are generally set to 2 meters and 15 minutes; however, this distance should be lengthened, and the time should be shortened for more infectious variants. Second, Bluetooth- or geolocation-based CTAs also face the problem of lack of accuracy. For example, individuals in 2 adjacent vehicles during traffic jams may be at a distance of 2 meters to make the CTA trace contact, but the 2 users may actually be separated by car doors, which could prevent transmission and infection. In addition, we investigated infection detection rates in 33 countries, 16 (48.5%) of which had significantly low infection detection rates, wherein CTAs could have lacked effectiveness in reducing virus propagation. Regarding policy, CTAs in most countries can only be used in their own countries and lack interoperability among other countries. In addition, 7 countries have already discontinued CTAs, but we believe that it was too early to discontinue them. Regarding user acceptance, 28.6% (28/98) of CTAs had no official source of information that could reduce user acceptance.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Conclusions: We surveyed all CTAs worldwide, identified their technological policy and acceptance issues, and provided solutions for each of the issues we identified. This study aimed to provide useful guidance and suggestions for updating the existing CTAs and the subsequent development of new CTAs.",0,,False,Test

Introduction,0,,False,Test
Background,0,,False,Test
"COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019 [1,2]. In previous research, the mean reproductive number of COVID-19 was 3.28, which was higher than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome [3]. COVID-19 has a relatively high reproductive number and an initial estimated case fatality rate of 5.6% [4]. As of May 2022, a total of 525 million cases have been confirmed by government agencies worldwide, and more than 6.2 million deaths have been reported [5]. In addition, COVID-19 has considerably affected various service sectors such as tourism [6].",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Transmission of COVID-19 is mainly because of airborne transmission of the virus; thus, surface disinfectants, hand hygiene, wearing a mask, ventilation, maintaining social distance, and rapid tracing and notification of potentially infected persons are crucial to prevent infection spread [7,8]. Contact tracing, followed by the prompt isolation of close contacts of an infected individual, is another strategy for preventing virus propagation. Therefore, for tracing infected persons, many countries have launched several digital contact tracing (DCT) methods to supplement manual contact tracing (MCT) [9]. As mobile phones are indispensable in today's society, several nations have implemented mobile phone-based contact-tracing apps (CTAs) to alert people who have been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2. Currently, despite widespread vaccination in some countries, many parts of the world remain unvaccinated. Even in highly vaccinated countries, COVID-19 continues to cause increased mortality and high levels of infections every 3 to 6 months. The widespread and effective use of CTAs may allow most people to return to their jobs, social events, and family life in capacities similar to those before the pandemic, implying less future morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. In addition, for diseases other than COVID-19 that are transmitted through close contact in the current (eg, monkeypox, Ebola, and COVID-19) and potential future outbreaks, CTA can be used to trace contacts. For example, CTAs have already been used to trace Ebola worldwide, serving as a precedent for mobile phone apps being used to trace contacts for diseases other than COVID-19.",1,Transmission,True,Test
"Moreover, because some CTAs register personal information and collect user location data, the protection of personal privacy is an important issue facing CTAs. People worldwide have different attitudes regarding whether governments should protect personal privacy. A study showed that only 6% of people in the United States were very confident, and 25% were somewhat confident that the US government protected data privacy [10]. By contrast, a survey showed that in 2021, a total of 91% of Chinese respondents said that they trusted the Chinese government, the highest rate among the 28 countries surveyed, with a global average of only 52% of respondents saying that they trusted their governments [11]. Another study showed that 37.6% of the Chinese respondents investigated lacked privacy",1,personal,True,Test
"trust in the government [12]. In general, Chinese people have far more trust in their government's ability to protect their privacy than people in the United States do. This trust may lead to a higher acceptance of CTAs in China than in the United States. Additionally, people in countries with lower economic living standards tend to have lower web-based concerns about private personal information than those living in low-income countries [13]. Differences in people's privacy concerns and trust in the ability of governments to protect privacy in different countries can lead to large differences in the acceptance of CTAs.",1,personal,True,Test
Literature Review,0,,False,Test
"Previous studies have assessed the effectiveness of CTAs in single countries, including Finland, Switzerland, and Australia [14-16]. Since our study was an international study, it was extremely difficult to assess the effectiveness of all CTAs using the same research method. Therefore, this study focuses on identifying the theoretical and technical issues that may affect the effectiveness of CTAs and offers suggestions for addressing them. A previous study showed that different countries have different data protection policies that prevent most CTAs from being used in other countries like they are used in their own country [17]. However, this study did not mention the extent of interoperability of CTAs or list specific interoperable CTAs. Previous studies in Europe, New Zealand, and Japan have investigated the public acceptance of CTAs and the factors that influence public acceptance using questionnaires [18-20]. Therefore, this study clarifies which CTAs have issues that may affect their public acceptance. Several previous studies have investigated dozens of CTAs. A study selected CTAs from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, summarized the technology used in the CTAs, and analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of each technology (Bluetooth, GPS, and Wi-Fi) [21]. Another study categorized CTAs by underlying technology and investigated the number of CTA installations and the privacy design and public acceptance [22]. A third study analyzed the different technologies for implementing contact tracing using centralized, decentralized, and hybrid protocols and analyzed privacy issues at the technical level [23]. In addition, several previous studies have compared CTAs around the world [24-26]. However, no study has exhaustively investigated every CTA worldwide or the respective technologies used. CTAs in different countries or continents have various shortcomings, owing to differences in regional characteristics and national policies and the use of different technologies. In contrast to studies that have investigated several CTAs, this study investigated nearly every available CTA and identified common issues across CTAs.",1,flu,True,Test

We aimed to provide information for future CTA development and make recommendations for improving CTAs. Governments, health authorities, and technical teams in countries that have already launched CTAs may update and improve the CTAs by following our recommendations, such as extending the tracing distance of Bluetooth-based CTAs and enhancing the cross-border interoperability of CTAs.

"After searching keywords through Google, Google Scholar, and PubMed, 64.5 % (127/197) of the countries were found to have launched 166 COVID-19 apps. Excluding 34 nonnational apps, 9 of the remaining apps were not CTAs; 25 apps have been reported to have been used for contact tracing, but they could not be used practically or did not have sufficient evidence (official websites or research papers) regarding contact tracing. Finally, 98 apps developed by 95 countries with sufficient evidence of a contact-tracing function were identified (Multimedia Appendix 1 and Figure 1). China, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan each had 2 CTAs that were used for contact tracing. A flow diagram depicting the screening procedure is shown in Figure 2.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Among the 95 countries with CTAs, Asian countries had the highest number of CTAs (35/95, 36.8%), whereas Oceania and South America each had the lowest number of CTAs (6/95, 6.3%). Regarding the number of countries with CTAs as a percentage of all countries on a continent, Asia had the highest percentage (35/48, 72.9%), and Africa had the lowest (9/54, 16.7%). The number of CTAs that could be practically used on either Android or iOS systems was 63, accounting for 64.3% (63/98) of all the CTAs. In the remaining CTAs (37/98, 37.8%), the app could not be used because it could not be installed, requiring mobile phone number in a specific country or personal ID, or it could be installed but could not be opened or crashed after opening. After testing all the available CTAs and investigating the introductory information from official websites or previous literature for the nonavailable CTAs, we found that the technologies used for contact tracing could be divided into 3 main categories: Bluetooth, geolocation, and QR code. Bluetooth was the most widely used technology, used in 71 (72.4%) of the 98 CTAs; 35 (35.7%) CTAs used geolocation, and 21 (21.4%) used QR codes (Multimedia Appendix 1). Of the 98 CTAs included in this study, 45 (45.9%) required the",1,personal,True,Test

"Regarding the interoperability of CTAs among different countries, 17 national CTAs could be operated in different countries. Table 1 shows specific information on the CTAs that had interoperability and the CTAs that could be operated. Of these, 16 were CTAs in EU countries; these CTAs are generally available and can be operated in >10 countries in the European Union. The only CTA other than the CTAs in EU countries that had interoperability was the careFIJI (CTA of Fiji), which can be used in New Zealand.",0,,False,Test
"In addition to collecting information on CTAs, we investigated the estimated COVID-19 infection detection rate (percentage of positives detected to the number of true positives) based on the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation model in countries with CTAs; the data were available for 33 countries (Table 2). The highest detection rate was observed in Iceland (52%), and the lowest was observed in Myanmar, Pakistan, Niger, Uganda, and Bangladesh (close to 0%).",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Detection rate means percentage of positives detected to the number of true positives. Of the 98 CTAs, 85 (87%) had official websites created by their respective governments, health departments, or developers (Multimedia Appendix 2). In the CTA information available in Multimedia Appendix 2, yes indicates that the official website includes a CTA guide, functions of the CTA, and other CTA-related information, with a total of 70 CTAs; no indicates CTAs with official websites, but without any introduction in official websites, with a total of 15 CTAs; unknown indicates CTAs without official websites, with a total of 13 CTAs. Investigating the download number data for 2022 for each CTA was difficult; only the 2020 download data were available for most CTAs. Of the countries for which download number data were available for 2022, WeChat (a Chinese CTA) had the highest percentage of downloads to the total population at approximately 88.8% (1.28 billion/1.45 billion). The reasons for this high percentage are as follows. (1) WeChat is not only a CTA but also a national chat app in China. (2) In China, it is impossible to enter large public places and move across provinces without the health codes contained in the app. Downloads as a percentage of the total population were, in descending order, Corona-Warn-App (45,820,000/84,324,494, 54.3%; Germany), NHS COVID-19 (31,044,213/68,605,590, 45.3%; United Kingdom), CoronaMelder (5,864,547/17,211,368, 34.1%; the Netherlands), COCOA (37,340,000/125,695,455, 29.7%; Japan), Koronavilkku (1,311,220/5,506,784, 23.8%; Finland), Radar COVID (8,568,514/46,791,314, 18.3%; Spain), and Aarogya Setu (216,800,000/1,407,993,700, 15.4%; India).",1,positive,True,Test

"The principle of CTAs using QR codes to trace contacts is as follows: when a user wants to enter a public place (eg, supermarket, restaurant, or movie theater), the user will either volunteer or be instructed to scan the QR code set up in the public place to record check in and if the user tests positive for COVID-19, the public place that they visited will be classified as a high-risk area.

The study also simulated the infection rate of 2 people talking at different times, and the results showed that at a distance of 1 meter, 2 people talking without masks for 15 minutes showed a maximum infection rate of 95% and an average infection rate of 60%; for 6 minutes, they showed a maximum infection rate of 70% and an average infection rate of 30%; for 3 minutes, their maximum and average rates of infection dropped to 30% and 10%, respectively. Therefore, to maintain the infection rate of the Omicron variant at <10%, the tracing distance and time should be set to 1 meter and 3 minutes or 3 meters and 15 minutes. Among the 21 CTAs in Table 3, 14 (66.7%) had a tracing time of 15 minutes and 13 (92.8%) of these had a tracing distance of 2 meters. The contact-tracing distance and time settings for these CTAs were 2 meters and 15 minutes, as per the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control guidelines [33]. However, with the drastic reduction in face mask use in some countries, more infectious variants may be transmitted to others at a tracing distance and time much greater than 2 meters and much lesser than 15 minutes, respectively. Thus, current Bluetooth-based CTAs may not be able to trace many potentially infected individuals, because it may have tracing ranges that are too short to identify possible contact and spread. Importantly, in most countries, users who receive a CTA exposure notification are not mandated to quarantine or to undergo polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Instead, with longer tracing distances and shorter tracing times, users can prepare for possible infections after receiving the exposure notification; for example, preparing food and sanitary products before the infection leads to fever and weakness. Thus, setting longer tracing distances and shorter tracing times for CTAs should be preferred.",1,infectious,True,Test
"Bluetooth- and geolocation-based contact tracing face many real-life problems that lead to decreased accuracy or false positives. For instance, in a public toilet, although 2 users with CTAs may be at a distance of 2 meters, making the CTAs trace contact, the 2 users may actually be separated by a thin wall or two, which could prevent infection [34]. Individuals in 2 adjacent vehicles may face a similar situation during traffic jams (Figure 5). In addition, signal absorption by the human body (when the mobile phone is in the pocket); interference of Wi-Fi signals; and absorption, interference, and diffraction caused by obstacles made of different materials in the signal propagation path can decrease the accuracy of Bluetooth tracing [35-37]. Moreover, different CTA detection rules in railways may lead to a 50% false-alarm rate [37]. Some countries have developed various countermeasures to cope with situations that may lead to decreased accuracy in CTAs. For example, the CTA in Singapore records contacts at a distance of 10 meters; therefore, there will often be signals being transmitted through walls,",1,contact,True,Test

In response, TraceTogether (CTA of Singapore) uploads contact-tracing data to the Ministry of Health, which processes and filters them based on their duration and signal strength to identify only close contacts [38]. HaMagen requests access to body movement data during initial use to avoid false alarm situations when individuals are separated by 2 adjacent vehicles during traffic jams. NOVID, developed at Carnegie Mellon University, uses a combination of ultrasound and Bluetooth. It is the only CTA that uses ultrasound to measure the distance for contact tracing. The NOVID research team experimentally found that at distances<1.82 meter, 103 out of 187 total experimental samples were correctly identified with an accuracy rate of 55.1%, whereas at distances >12 feet, 225 experimental samples were correctly identified 224 times, with an accuracy rate of 99.6%. Moreover, in real life, the tracing accuracy for a distance of <6 feet would be significantly >55.1% [39]. In addition, the ultrasonic method used by NOVID is effective in excluding false positives even in the presence of obstacles [39]. Therefore, ultrasonic technology has great potential for improving the accuracy of CTAs in contact tracing, particularly at long distances and in the presence of obstacles.",1,contact,True,Test
"The detection rate of COVID-19 is one of the key factors affecting the effectiveness of CTAs. Low detection rates reduce the effectiveness of CTAs because contact tracing is impossible without a confirmed diagnosis, which is a serious challenge for both DCT and MCT. Previous research has shown that contact tracing barely reduces viral propagation when the detection rate is only 13%, and the effectiveness of contact tracing increases significantly when the detection rate increases to 26% or 37% [40]. In June 2020, the average detection rate worldwide was <10% and varied significantly among countries [41]. Therefore, the use of CTAs may not be effective in reducing viral propagation in most countries. Table 2 shows the data for the 33 countries that have developed CTAs wherein detection rates are available [42]. Even in the latter half of 2021 and 2022, only 11 (33.3%) of the 33 countries showed detection rates of >26%, and 3 (9.1%) countries showed detection rates of >37%. There are 16 (48.5%) countries that have not yet reached a detection rate of 13%; in these countries, CTAs can have an extremely limited effect. Currently, PCR testing is free and routine in some countries such as China and Japan. However, the cost of PCR testing varies greatly depending on factors such as the type of laboratory, country or region, and insurance provider [43]. Previous studies have shown that the cost of PCR testing, cost of commuting to a testing site, and time required for PCR testing can make it difficult for people who are willing to be tested [44,45]. Moreover, the convenience and comfort of the sample extraction method affected the willingness to test [45]. In many countries, PCR testing is expensive and difficult to access. This lack of access may lead to CTAs not being able to effectively trace potential infections and eventual getting discontinued. Therefore, making PCR testing free and routine may increase the willingness of users to undergo the test and improve the effectiveness of CTAs. In China, the following methods were used to increase the testing rates. Nationals who did not have a PCR testing certificate within the last 72 hours were not allowed to enter public places such as shopping malls, movie theaters, and public bathrooms and were not allowed to move across",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"According to our results, of the 197 sovereign countries around the world, 95 (48.2%) have developed 98 apps for contact tracing. However, different countries have different data protection policies that prevent most CTAs from being used in other countries as they are used in their own countries [17]. The CTA interoperability system, which was launched in October 2020 within the European Union, was the first CTA system to remove national operational barriers. The first countries to join this system were Germany, Italy, and Ireland [48]. We investigated CTAs that can be used in other countries as of May 2022; currently, only 17 CTAs can be used in other countries, 16 (94.1%) of which are in the European Union (Table 1). However, with the increasing liberalization of border measures of each country and international travel, the current interoperability of CTAs among countries other than those from Europe does not meet the status quo. International travelers may come into close contact with patients who tested positive for COVID-19 in other countries while traveling on international flights and while traveling in their destination country. However, because CTAs are not interoperable, travelers may not be able to detect transmission or infection resulting from close contact. Since the novel coronavirus has an incubation period of days to weeks, travelers may mistakenly believe that they are not infected until they have significant symptoms. Thus, tourists may spend time in public places for sightseeing, unaware that they have been infected. In this case, if tourists do not restrict their activities in public places, the virus may be further transmitted to more people. Increasing the interoperability of CTAs and removing national barriers among different countries is an important method to avoid cross-country transmission of COVID-19.",1,contact,True,Test
"CTA policy is no longer stringent. With the increasing number of vaccinations, high asymptomatic rates, and low mortality presented by the Omicron variant compared with initial strains [49], many countries are easing their COVID-19 protection policies, with a trend of relaxation in rules regarding CTAs. For example, according to official information, the QR code-based",1,asymptomatic,True,Test
"check-in function was abolished in the United Kingdom from February 24, 2022 [50]. Meanwhile, we found through practical use, the QR code scanning function of the previous version of the NHS COVID-19 app (CTA of the United Kingdom) was removed. Moreover, Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Finland, and Canada have discontinued their CTAs. This implies that CTAs no longer support contact tracing or notifications. However, we believe that this was a premature discontinuation of CTAs because of the following reasons. First, a study in South Africa investigated the asymptomatic rate of different variant infections in 577 health care patients who received a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine (2.6% for Beta and Delta and 16% for Omicron variants) [49], and another meta-analysis showed an asymptomatic rate of 40% for those infected with the Omicron virus [51]. According to the data, even with vaccination, more than half of the patients infected with Omicron developed symptoms. Therefore, as stated earlier in this section, users who receive notifications of exposure through CTAs can be well prepared for the possibility of symptoms. Especially in countries where medical resources are scarce, users can contact their physicians and reserve hospital beds earlier. Second, in the 2 years since the launch of CTAs, many countries have shown large CTA-using populations. Among the CTAs of countries that have discontinued CTAs, eRouska (CTA of the Czech Republic) has 1.7 million users, reaching 15.9% of the total population [52], and discontinuing CTAs may cause widespread uninstallation of the app. However, it is not possible to predict whether a more infectious variant of COVID-19 with a higher mortality rate or other new infectious diseases will emerge in future; the increase in the number of CTA-installed users is a slow process that may miss the best time for contact tracing. The official website of Smittestopp (CTA of Norway) shows that people in Norway no longer need to register COVID-19 positivity on their CTA. However, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health still supports the CTA and suggests that people keep Smittestopp on their mobile phones in case infection rates start to rise again [53].",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"Regarding user acceptance, a study based on a large-scale web-based survey in Japan showed an increase in the level of knowledge related to COCOA (CTA in Japan) to be associated with acceptance of the CTA. Therefore, sufficient knowledge about CTAs, such as the technology of the CTAs for contact tracing, privacy policy, and data storage time, can be effective in encouraging their use among people [20]. Official websites containing information on CTAs are one of the main sources of information for understanding CTAs. In this study, 98 official websites of CTAs were investigated, of which 70 (71.4%) had detailed information, and among the 28 CTAs that lacked sufficient information, 15 (53.6%) had official websites without relevant information, and 13 (46.4%) did not have official websites (Multimedia Appendix 2).

It is important to note that the NHS COVID-19 CTA (CTA of the United Kingdom) requires information about the postal code and region of address, and the COVID TRACKER (CTA of Ireland) requires the selection of whether the person is aged >16 years.

"address, mobile phone number, or any other detailed information. By contrast, 25 (65.8%) of the 38 CTAs in Asia require personal information; most of which require detailed information such as name and mobile phone number. CTAs that do not require personal information have a lower risk of violating privacy than those that require detailed information. However, as nationals from different countries have different levels of trust in their governments and previous literature shows that people in countries with lower economic living standards are less concerned about the privacy of personal information than people in developed countries [13], nationals of different countries may be differently receptive to CTAs that require personal information. In addition, at the technical level, CTAs based on decentralized Bluetooth technology do not require the user's location data and thus are most likely to protect the user's location data. By contrast, location-based CTAs access the user's location data and thus know where the user is in real time. With QR code-based CTAs, the user's location is not known when the user does not enter a public place; however, once the user enters a public place, the CTA records ""check-ins"" at specific locations. Therefore, location-based CTAs and QR code-based CTAs carry the risk of violating users' location privacy. Figure 6 classifies CTAs by technology and by whether personal information is required, indicating the risk of possible privacy violations. CTAs that use decentralized Bluetooth technology and do not require any personal information have the lowest risk of violating user privacy. Most European CTAs are classified under this category. CTAs that use both location and QR code technologies and require detailed personal information have the highest risk of privacy violation.

Conclusions,0,,False,Test
"For airborne infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, contact tracing is important to reduce viral propagation, and mobile app-based DCT is an effective tool to assist MCT. In this study, we investigated CTAs worldwide; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate nearly all CTAs worldwide. We combined the results of this study with those of previous studies to identify common issues in the technology, policy, and user acceptance of CTAs. Most of the current Bluetooth-based CTAs have set the distance and time of tracing contact at 2 meters and 15 minutes; however, considering that several viral variants have stronger infectivity than the initial strains, 2 meters and 15 minutes is not sufficient. Contact-tracing distance and time set at 3 meters and 15 minutes or 1 meter and 3 minutes is preferred. Although some low-income countries with low infection detection rates have launched their own CTAs, the CTAs may not be effective in reducing viral",1,infectious,True,Test
"propagation. Currently, only the European Union has developed an interoperable system that allows CTAs to be used in other countries, and outside the European Union, only careFIJI (CTA of Fiji) can be used in New Zealand. Other countries' CTAs do not have interoperability among different countries. Removing CTAs' national barriers and increasing interoperability worldwide are critical because countries are gradually opening their borders, and COVID-19 policies are being implemented less strictly. Creating official websites that include information on CTAs would increase their user acceptance and promote installation; 28 (28.6%) of 98 CTAs lacked access to comprehensive and reliable CTA information through official websites. We examined several practical situations that may affect the accuracy of GPS location; 3 CTAs were found to address this lack of accuracy. Among these, the ultrasonic technology used by NOVID was effective in improving the accuracy of the CTA after several rounds of experiments. We found that CTAs have been discontinued in 5 countries since February 2022. We believe that this was a premature discontinuation because COVID-19 has not been eliminated, and it is not possible to predict whether new variants will emerge in the future.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"In addition, vaccination has been shown to reduce infection rates, alleviate infection symptoms, and reduce case fatality rates. Therefore, we believe that in countries with widespread vaccination, users do not need extremely stringent measures such as mandatory hospitalization or 14-day self-isolation after receiving notifications of CTA exposure. Overresponse to CTA exposure notifications disrupts both the daily lives of users and the national economy. However, we believe that the greatest benefit of CTAs is that users who receive exposure notifications can prepare for possible infections in advance. For example, users who receive exposure notifications can wear masks to avoid spreading the virus to more people, cancel unnecessary plans to visit public places, make appointments for PCR testing, and prepare medicines in advance to deal with fever and debilitation after infection. Currently, most countries do not mandate that nationals respond upon receiving CTA exposure notification, but the government or health departments should provide guidelines and suggestions on measures to be taken by users who receive an exposure notification.

"Background Timely, accurate, and comprehensive estimates of SARS-CoV-2 daily infection rates, cumulative infections, the proportion of the population that has been infected at least once, and the effective reproductive number (R ) effective are essential for understanding the determinants of past infection, current transmission patterns, and a population's susceptibility to future infection with the same variant. Although several studies have estimated cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections in select locations at specific points in time, all of these analyses have relied on biased data inputs that were not adequately corrected for. In this study, we aimed to provide a novel approach to estimating past SARS-CoV-2 daily infections, cumulative infections, and the proportion of the population infected, for 190 countries and territories from the start of the pandemic to Nov 14, 2021. This approach combines data from reported cases, reported deaths, excess deaths attributable to COVID-19, hospitalisations, and seroprevalence surveys to produce more robust estimates that minimise constituent biases.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"Methods We produced a comprehensive set of global and location-specific estimates of daily and cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections through Nov 14, 2021, using data largely from Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD, USA) and national databases for reported cases, hospital admissions, and reported deaths, as well as seroprevalence surveys identified through previous reviews, SeroTracker, and governmental organisations. We corrected these data for known biases such as lags in reporting, accounted for under-reporting of deaths by use of a statistical model of the proportion of excess mortality attributable to SARS-CoV-2, and adjusted seroprevalence surveys for waning antibody sensitivity, vaccinations, and reinfection from SARS-CoV-2 escape variants. We then created an empirical database of infection-detection ratios (IDRs), infection-hospitalisation ratios (IHRs), and infection-fatality ratios (IFRs). To estimate a complete time series for each location, we developed statistical models to predict the IDR, IHR, and IFR by location and day, testing a set of predictors justified through published systematic reviews. Next, we combined three series of estimates of daily infections (cases divided by IDR, hospitalisations divided by IHR, and deaths divided by IFR), into a more robust estimate of daily infections. We then used daily infections to estimate cumulative infections and the cumulative proportion of the population with one or more infections, and we then calculated posterior estimates of cumulative IDR, IHR, and IFR using cumulative infections and the corrected data on reported cases, hospitalisations, and deaths. Finally, we converted daily infections into a historical time series of Reffective by location and day based on assumptions of duration from infection to infectiousness and time an individual spent being infectious. For each of these quantities, we estimated a distribution based on an ensemble framework that captured uncertainty in data sources, model design, and parameter assumptions.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test

"Findings Global daily SARS-CoV-2 infections fluctuated between 3 million and 17 million new infections per day between April, 2020, and October, 2021, peaking in mid-April, 2021, primarily as a result of surges in India. Between the start of the pandemic and Nov 14, 2021, there were an estimated 3·80 billion (95% uncertainty interval 3·44-4·08) total SARS-CoV-2 infections and reinfections combined, and an estimated 3·39 billion (3·08-3·63) individuals, or 43·9% (39·9-46·9) of the global population, had been infected one or more times. 1·34 billion (1·20-1·49) of these infections occurred in south Asia, the highest among the seven super-regions, although the sub-Saharan Africa super-region had the highest infection rate (79·3 per 100 population [69·0-86·4]). The high-income super-region had the fewest infections (239 million [226-252]), and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania had the lowest infection rate (13·0 per 100 population [8·4-17·7]). The cumulative proportion of the population ever infected varied greatly between countries and territories, with rates higher than 70% in 40 countries and lower than 20% in 39 countries. There was no discernible relationship between Reffective and total immunity, and even at total immunity levels of 80%, we observed no indication of an abrupt drop in R , effective indicating that there is not a clear herd immunity threshold observed in the data.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test

"Measuring SARS-CoV-2's daily infection rate, cumulative infections, and the proportion of the population with one or more infections is essential for understanding the determinants of past transmission, identifying ongoing inequities, predicting future trajectories of the COVID-19 pandemic, and, in theory, prioritising vaccination allocations. Daily infections are also the crucial input into",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"measuring the changing effective reproductive number (R , effective the number of subsequent infections caused by a new infection).1-3 A robust assessment of Reffective by day in each location is useful to help evaluate the effect of the wide range of non-pharmaceutical interventions that have been deployed during the pandemic. The Reffective over time is also a crucial input into future forecasts of COVID-19.4 Cumulative infections can help us identify",1,pandemic,True,Test
Research in context,0,,False,Test
"Evidence before this study This study was conceptualised and developed from the start of the pandemic to fill a void in the provision of timely estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections for tracking the pandemic and to provide inputs to epidemiological models of transmission. Several research groups have estimated SARS-CoV-2 daily or cumulative infections in select locations at specific points in time. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates cumulative infections by approximating the infection- detection ratio (IDR) using assumptions about the portion of the population who will seek care. The Serotracker project reports on the universe of seroprevalence surveys and some attributes of these surveys, but it does not make estimates of cumulative infections based on these data. Noh and Danuser (2021) used reported deaths and published estimates of the infection-fatality ratio (IFR) to estimate cumulative infections for US states and select countries. To our knowledge, however, no source has provided estimates, either periodic or regularly updated, of global daily and cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections at this resolution (399 administrative units).",1,pandemic,True,Test
"Added value of this study This study is the first comprehensive analysis of global daily and cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections to date and improves upon previous infection estimation strategies in several important ways. First, we combined three approaches that have been used to estimate daily infections: cases divided by the IDR, hospitalisations divided by the infection-hospitalisation ratio (IHR), and deaths divided by the IFR. Combining these estimates gave us a more robust estimate of daily infections that was less susceptible to biases within and between each type of measure. Second, estimates of total COVID-19 deaths derived from a comprehensive assessment of excess mortality and a statistical estimate of the portion of excess mortality directly due to COVID-19 allowed for more meaningful interpretation of spatial heterogeneity in total COVID-19 mortality rates. Third, we used a systematic analysis of available seroprevalence data matched in",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"space and time to cases, hospitalisations, and deaths to empirically estimate the IDR, IHR, and IFR. Because the IHR and IFR are profoundly age related, we also estimated agestandardised ratios for these quantities. Fourth, for locations without seroprevalence surveys, we used statistical models based on the available empirical data and the testing of a wide range of covariates to predict the IDR, IHR, and IFR. Fifth, we used daily infections to estimate cumulative infections and, with assumptions on cross-variant immunity, the cumulative number of individuals with one or more infections, as well as posterior estimates of cumulative IDR, IHR, and IFR. Sixth, we incorporated corrections to the primary data into the analysis to deal with known biases such as waning antibody test sensitivity. Seventh, our ensemble model reflects the uncertainty of the data sources, model design, and parameter assumptions included in the analysis. Finally, the methods developed to triangulate on daily infections, cumulative infections, and the proportion of the population infected once or more than once have been developed into easily applied statistical code, so estimates can be shared and updated rapidly and iteratively on the basis of the frequency of newly reported data.",1,case,True,Test
"Implications of all the available evidence SARS-CoV-2 has been extremely widespread, causing 3·80 billion (95% uncertainty interval 3·44-4·08) infections and reinfections as of Nov 14, 2021, infecting 43·9% (39·9-46·9) of the world's population. The proportion of the population infected has varied greatly across countries, suggesting that host immunity characteristics and national and local policies play a crucial role in determining patterns of transmission. Our comprehensive modelling approach provides a database of daily infections and effective reproductive number by location from the beginning of the pandemic to Nov 14, 2021, which can be used to develop insights into the determinants of transmission, identify ongoing inequities, establish standards for vaccine prioritisation, and more.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test

"which nations and communities have been able to keep transmission at lower levels, potentially creating the opportunity to learn from these success stories. Finally, a sound measurement of the proportion of the population ever infected could help to identify which communities are at greater risk of future transmission and might be a factor that should be considered in vaccine prioritisation.5",1,transmission,True,Test
"Several studies have estimated cumulative infections in select countries at specific points in time.6-9 Some of these studies have used seroprevalence surveys, while others have made estimates of infections by assuming a particular infection-detection ratio (IDR).7,10-12 One study estimated infections in the USA and other select countries,13 and other studies have done multinational systematic reviews and meta-analyses of seroprevalence surveys.14,15 The fundamental problem in all of these analyses is that each of the data series observed has potential biases: reported cases capture only a portion of infections, and this portion will be a function of the availability of testing; reported deaths capture only a subset of total COVID-19 deaths, and the infection-fatality ratio (IFR) can vary widely over time and across locations;16-19 the proportion of patients with an infection who are admitted to hospital can also vary over time and location; and seroprevalence surveys can be influenced by sampling design, waning of sensitivity of antibody tests, and vaccination rates. Few studies have combined data from reported cases, reported deaths, hospitalisations, and seroprevalence surveys to triangulate daily infections, and WHO only routinely reports confirmed cases, not estimated infections.20 The use of such sources of incomplete, biased, and heterogeneous case data uncritically in research, science, and policy will result in inferences confounded to unknown levels by these known problems.",1,case,True,Test
"In this study, we present an approach to estimating past SARS-CoV-2 daily infections, cumulative infections through Nov 14, 2021, and the proportion of the population with one or more infections on the basis of reported cases, total deaths attributable to COVID-19, hospitalisations, and seroprevalence surveys. This approach attempts to deal with the biases in each of these measures and use them all to triangulate daily infections. With this statistical approach to the fusion of these data streams, we aimed to provide a method that can be applied on a rapid and ongoing basis, so that these estimates remain maximally relevant for research, science, and policy and can be immediately and freely available. Importantly, we incorporated various sources of uncertainty in daily infections into the analysis to help informed assessment of the variation in space and time of the fidelity of the estimates.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test

"corrected, and calibrated into an internally complete and consistent time series at national and subnational levels) to further timely research, discovery, and policy inference. Our approach can be divided into seven steps, which are applied by use of an ensemble model framework. First, we developed a dataset of reported COVID-19 cases, total COVID-19 deaths, and hospitalisations (where available), corrected for known biases such as lags in reporting. Second, we identified representative SARS-CoV-2 sero­ preval­ence surveys that could be used to create a database of cumulative infections and adjusted them for waning antibody sensitivity, vaccinations, and reinfection from escape variants. Third, using adjusted seroprevalence survey data matched to cases, hospitalisations, and deaths, we created an empirical database of IDRs, infection- hospitalisation ratios (IHRs), and IFRs. Fourth, for locations without seroprevalence surveys and to estimate a complete time series for each location, we developed statistical models to predict the IDR, IHR, and IFR by location and day, as a function of a wide range of covariates. Fifth, three series of estimates of daily infections (cases divided by IDR, hospitalisations divided by IHR, and deaths divided by IFR) were combined into a more robust estimate of daily infections. Sixth, we used the combined time series of daily infections to estimate cumulative infections and the cumulative proportion of the population with one or more infections, and calculate posterior estimates of cumulative IDR, IHR, and IFR. Seventh, we converted daily infections into a historical time series of Reffective by location and day, on the basis of assumptions of duration of the period from infection to infectiousness and time an individual spent being infectious. Estimates are given for all ages and both sexes combined for 190 countries and territories, and for subnational locations in ten of those countries, aggregated into 21 regions, seven super-regions,21 and globally, from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic through Nov 14, 2021.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"Ensemble framework Our model system includes many component parts that are inherently uncertain, ranging from input data sources and parameter assumptions to model specification. To account for this, we developed an ensemble framework wherein we varied the data and model settings across 100 iterations of the analysis, which were then run independently to yield 100 estimates of infections. These sources of uncertainty include seroprevalence survey error; bootstrapped samples of our seroprevalence database; estimates of seroreversion rates; estimates of total COVID-19 mortality; parameterisation of crossvariant immunity, increased risk of hospitalisation and death from non-ancestral SARS-CoV-2 variants, and durations associated with COVID-19 natural history;",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"Data inputs and corrections Data of reported cases were obtained largely from Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD, USA),23 with exceptions and additions noted in appendix 1 (section 4.1) and appendix 2 (section 4). Hospital admissions were largely sourced from national databases such as that of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the USA and the Secretaria de Vigilância em Saúde in Brazil (for an exhaustive list see appendix 2, section 1). Deaths were based on reported deaths data from Johns Hopkins University23 and various national sources from locations where data inconsistencies were evident in the Johns Hopkins University datasets (more details in appendix 1, section 4.3, and appendix 2, section 2). To account for the prevalent issue of under-reporting in COVID-19 deaths, we applied a scalar of reported to total COVID-19 deaths in our analysis. Total COVID-19 deaths, as defined by WHO, are all deaths where the deceased individuals were actively infected with SARS-CoV-2 at the time of the death. Estimates of total COVID-19 mortality were constructed with use of the statistical model developed by the COVID-19 Excess Mortality Collaborators to predict the excess mortality rate for all locations between Jan 1, 2020, and Nov 14, 2021.16 To estimate total COVID-19 mortality, we predicted a counterfactual excess mortality rate due to COVID-19 in which the IDR was set to the maximum observed values among all locations. The predicted excess mortality rate from this counterfactual analysis, corrected for under-reporting, resulted from insufficient testing and changes in mortality driven by behaviours such as deferred health care during periods of lockdown. We used the ratio of this counterfactual excess mortality rate and the prediction for the same period as a proxy for the proportion of excess mortality that is total COVID-19 mortality. Subsequently, a scalar of reported COVID-19 deaths to total COVID-19 deaths can be derived (more details in appendix 1, section 9.4). We identified seroprevalence surveys through a search protocol that leveraged previous reviews,24,25 SeroTracker,26 and routine inclusion of national and subnational surveys undertaken by governmental organisations. Studies that focused on specific subsets of the population--either a specific subpopulation such as health-care workers or specific locations such as specific cities--were typically excluded as a result of not being representative. In total, we identified 2817 seroprevalence survey datapoints (of 6420 reviewed) for inclusion in this analysis.",1,case,True,Test

"Some hospital admissions data series only became available starting from weeks or months after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic--for example, the HHS database began in July, 2020. However, total cumulative hospitalisations are required to create our empirical estimate of IHR. In these instances, we leveraged information from the metrics that did have complete time coverage (cases and deaths) to impute the earlier portion of the admissions time series (appendix 1, section 4.2).",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Seroprevalence survey adjustments Seroprevalence surveys were corrected for vaccination, because vaccination generates a positive anti-spike antibody test in most individuals who receive the vaccine.27 In locations where vaccination rates have increased over time, population levels of anti-spike antibodies will be elevated. To correct for this, we adjusted seroprevalence estimates downward on the basis of vaccination rates in adults in every location, accounting for vaccination of previously infected individuals (appendix 1, section 5.1).",1,positive,True,Test
"Seroprevalence surveys provide an estimate of the number of individuals who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 one or more times; these surveys do not detect repeat infections in a single individual. Because reinfection can be common in settings where escape variants such as beta (B.1.351), gamma (P.1), and delta (B.1.617.2) are present,28-30 we had to adjust seroprevalence data to estimate the cumulative number of infections-- that is, to include both first and any subsequent infections. We used a level of cross-variant immunity of 30% to 70% between escape variants and ancestral variants and alpha (B.1.1.7), on the basis of an empirical analysis conducted by the COVID-19 Forecasting Team (unpublished). This estimate did not take into account that some individuals could have been infected more than once with ancestral variants.31 A detailed explanation of how we adjusted for escape variant prevalence is given in appendix 1 (section 5.2).",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"Lastly, seroprevalence surveys were corrected for waning sensitivity of antibody tests. We identified eight categories of antibody tests; for each of these, we used a reported curve of sensitivity over time.32-34 To implement the correction based on waning, we used initial estimates of the timing of infection based on reported deaths. We did not adjust for specificity, as reported specificity for all available commercial assays included in the analysis is over 95% and mostly over 98% (more details in appendix 1, sections 5.3 and 9.3).35",1,curve,True,Test

"Empirical estimates of the IDR, IHR, and IFR Using the adjusted seroprevalence data we have described, we created a dataset of 2817 empirical measurements of the IDR in which the numerator was the cumulative number of confirmed cases and the denominator was the number of cumulative infections and reinfections combined. We aligned cases and seroprevalence on the basis of individual record data suggesting that exposure to a laboratory-confirmed case was typically 10-13 days36 and exposure to seroconversion was 14-17 days.37-39 Figure 1A shows these empirical estimates of location-specific IDR over the course of the pandemic.

"Using adjusted seroprevalence surveys matched to cumulative hospitalisations, we developed a dataset of 2580 empirical estimates of the IHR. Based on the same data and analysis used to determine the lag for cases,36 we used a 10-13-day lag for hospitalisations. Far fewer locations reported hospitalisations, so less information was available for this metric than for the IDR. We used 703 surveys that included age-specific seroprevalence data to estimate the IHR age pattern, and we then used indirect age standardisation to estimate the age-standardised IHR across locations and used those age-standardised estimates in the modelling of the IHR (more details on indirect standardisation methods in appendix 1, section 6.1).

"between testing per person and the IDR. To capture the rise in health system capacity to deliver testing, we used the observed maximum testing rate up to a given date as the covariate. Additionally, we included universal healthcare coverage, the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index, and the proportion of the population older than 65 years as covariates that each submodel selected from in our ensemble. These covariates were estimated for all locations as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD; appendix 1, sections 6.3 and 9.6).43",1,Disease,True,Test
"Predictive covariates for IHR and IFR were primarily based on a list of underlying medical conditions identified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as increasing the risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection.44 We cross-referenced this list with a study of individuals admitted to hospital in the USA41 that evaluated the increased risk of in-hospital death to identify seven possible covariates, all of which were included in our models as age-standardised prevalence in the population (estimated as part of GBD): obesity, smoking, diabetes, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.43 Several of these covariates, most prominently obesity, were further supported by relationships in US claims45 and Brazil hospitalisations data.46 To this list, we also added universal health-care coverage and the HAQ Index. We then tested all possible combinations of these covariates and selected the top 100 most predictive combinations to use across submodels in our ensemble models of IHR and IFR (more details in appendix 1, section 9.6). We estimated age-standardised IHR and IFR using these covariates and then converted estimates back to all-age IHR and IFR to reflect population structure. We accounted for reductions in the IFR due to improved treatment over the course of the pandemic by including a spline on time in the regressions in addition to the ensemble covariates (more details on these models in appendix 1, sections 6.4, 6.5, and 9.6).",1,Disease,True,Test
"Vaccines and variants also affect the likelihood of severe disease and death, and thus influence both the IHR and the IFR. First, vaccination strategies that prioritise older age groups before younger ones can temporarily increase the relative proportion of infections that occur in younger individuals, thus lowering the population-level IFR and IHR for at least a period of time. Additionally, COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to confer higher levels of protection from severe disease and death than from mild infection, also serving to lower the overall IFR and IHR. The prevalence of variants with higher likelihood of severe disease and death can conversely increase these ratios,47 and the introduction of escape variants can increase them further by reducing vaccine efficacy. More information on how we accounted for these features can be found in appendix 1 (section 6.6).",1,Vaccine,True,Test
"Robust estimates of daily infections We then paired the estimates of our ratio models with data that were reported by local jurisdictions--accounting for reporting biases in cases through the testing covariate and in deaths through the total COVID-19 death scalars-- to estimate infections in a manner that was sensitive to local context, even in the absence of seroprevalence data. By dividing cases by the modelled IDR, hospitalisations by the modelled IHR, and deaths by the modelled IFR, we produced three daily infections time series (or two if only cases and deaths were reported for a given location). Estimates based on each input data type were shifted back in time by their respective lags, such that they were all indexed on date of infection. We then fit a time series spline model using all three data sources as inputs to triangulate a best estimate of daily infections. After deriving this mean estimate of daily infections, we sampled the residuals of the intermediate case-based, hospitalisation-based, and deaths-based infection estimates independently in each submodel and refit the infections curve to these data; this enabled us to more accurately reflect the volatility in reporting practices, such as for deaths, in our ensemble distribution of daily infections (more details in appendix 1, section 7).",1,case,True,Test
"Cumulative infections and cumulative proportion of the population infected at least once Daily infections, including reinfections, were summed to derive an estimate of cumulative infections. With this estimate of cumulative infections, we then returned to reported cases, reported hospitalisations, and total COVID-19 deaths to produce posterior estimates of cumulative IDR, IHR, and IFR. Where the reported data were not available, the posterior ratio estimate would be equal to the prediction from the ratio model. To estimate the proportion of individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at least once by Nov 14, 2021, we used the same assumptions already described. The crucial assumptions required were cross-variant immunity, the prevalence of escape variants, and the assumption that exposure to escape variants is independent of the probability of previous infection with ancestral variants.",1,case,True,Test

However, over the range of 30-60% total immunity, the percentage of observations with Reffective lower than 1 decreased back to 55%. This absence of a clear relationship highlights the many other factors such as seasonality, physical distancing mandates, mask use, and new variant spread that have influenced Reffective over time.

"In this study, we estimated that global daily SARS-CoV-2 infections fluctuated between 3 million and 17 million new cases per day from April, 2020, to October, 2021. In total, we estimated that between the start of the pandemic and Nov 14, 2021, there were 3·80 billion (95% UI 3·44-4·08) total SARS-CoV-2 infections and reinfections combined and that 3·39 billion (3·08-3·63) individuals had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 one or more times. The proportion of the population that had been infected at least once ranged from under 1% to over 80% across countries and territories. The highest cumulative infection rates were estimated in sub-Saharan Africa; central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia; and south Asia. Translating daily infections into Reffective showed no clear herd immunity threshold.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"Cumulative infection rates through Nov 14, 2021, varied greatly across countries and territories and between subnational units within countries. This variation can be explained by a combination of factors including policies enacted by governments to encourage mask use and reduce social interaction,48-50 presence of escape variants, testing and contact tracing capacity,51,52 previous exposure to other coronaviruses,53 baseline patterns of social interaction, and more. For instance, greatly different levels of cumulative infection were found in some neighbouri­ng countries with similar patterns of non-COVID-19 disease burden, such as Norway and Sweden.43 In these two countries, testing and contact tracing strategies, government restrictions,",1,mask,True,Test
"and mobility patterns varied substantially,54 contributing to substantially different SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. Other countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, have shown how early and effective lockdowns, combined with geographical isolation and travel restrictions, have kept transmission low throughout the study period.18,55,56 Excess mortality and seroprevalence data available suggest that some of the most severe COVID-19 epidemics occurred in eastern Europe and central Asia. This might be related to comparatively less public intervention, such as mask mandates or stay-at-home orders.57,58 But, although it might be tempting to ascribe all variations in cumulative infections to effective public health action in different countries, the April-September, 2021, surges in many southeast Asian countries where, up to the end of March, public health responses to the pandemic had been swift and believed to be effective,59-61 suggest that other factors might also be contributing to these patterns.57,58",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"The empirical measurements of the IDR suggest that it was low early in the pandemic, when testing was scarce, and increased as testing capacity expanded. On average, the IDR increased steadily, especially over the course of the first year of the pandemic, but with marked variation across countries. This variation highlights how analyses based on the assumption that SARS-CoV-2 IDR is constant across location and time7 could be very misleading. Although we expect that, in general, IDR increased as testing capacity increased, national guidance on who should be tested, and changes in that guidance over the course of the pandemic, might also affect the IDR. For example, on May 1, 2021, the CDC issued guidance not to test vaccinated individuals who had been exposed to COVID-19 but did not have symptoms.62 Likewise, the advent of workplace and school testing programmes in the later months of 2021 might also shift the IDR up in some countries. Great care needs to be taken when interpreting trends based only on reported cases in the later phases of the pandemic. In many settings, hospitalisations--which tend to be a robust measure of more severe disease--are likely to be more informative than confirmed infections.",1,pandemic,True,Test
"Our analysis suggests that the cumulative IFR across countries and territories ranged from 0·1% to 2·0% as of Nov 14, 2021. Age standardisation has been shown to explain a considerable portion of this variation,40 but substantial differences remain in the available data. Some of this variation appears to be due to the prevalence of certain comorbidites,63 and some could be residual errors in the estimation of excess mortality or seroprevalence in the available data. Nevertheless, it might turn out that other factors, such as previous exposure to other coronaviruses, help explain the considerable variation in the age-standardised IFR that is observed in the data. Such variation in the IFR should caution against studies that assume the IFR (either all-age or age-standardised) is constant across locations and over time. The temporal",1,coronavirus,True,Test

"analysis of the IFR supports the clinical observation that the IFR was initially much higher in March and April, 2020, and subsequently declined as clinical practice improved, particularly in approaches to oxygenation and the use of corticosteroids.64-67 Trials of some oral antivirals have shown substantial effectiveness in preventing severe disease and death, suggesting that the IFR might decline further in the coming months if these and other antivirals become widely available and if diagnostic capacity is able to support early treatment.68,69",1,clinical,True,Test
"We did not find a clear relationship between Reffective and total immunity up to 60%. Over 60%, Reffective was more often under 1·0 than over 1·0. Despite this finding, we observed no obvious herd immunity threshold in the data. The generally weak relationship between Reffective and the total immunity highlights the powerful role of other factors driving infection, including physical distancing mandates, seasonality, mask use, and the emergence of new variants over the study period (especially the delta variant) in mediating this relationship. Although figure 4 does not show us the prospects for reaching herd immunity in each location for any given season or variant, the overall relationship points to the very high degree of combined natural and vaccine-derived immunity that might be needed to block community transmission (especially in the winter months).",1,distancing,True,Test
"This empirical analysis has several important limitations. First, some seroprevalence surveys (such as the CDC monitoring of laboratory data) might be biased, but the direction of the bias is difficult to ascertain. Additionally, in reporting serosurveys, various corrections can be applied to produce estimates, including the use of sampling weights, correcting for manufacturing sensitivity and specificity, or, in some instances, full correction for waning detectability. Where possible, we attempted to standardise for this by extracting data that were adjusted for sampling frame and manufacturing sensitivity, but not more complex corrections. If this was not possible, we used the raw numerator and denominator as reported. In some instances, no metadata were provided to describe whether any correction had been applied. In all instances, these values were treated as equivalent. Second, we have assumed that one of the key covariates for the IDR is demonstrated testing capacity. By construction, this variable cannot decline as it is the maximum value of previously observed daily testing rates. In some countries, changes in guidance on who gets tested could lead to declines in effective testing and the IDR, and we may have missed these changes. The CDC guidance in spring, 2021, not to test vaccinated individuals who were asymptomatic or mildly symptom­ atic is an example of such a policy. Third, vaccination increases the proportion of the population who test positive on antispike antibody tests. We note in some locations, particularly in the UK, attempts to account for vaccination rates resulted in decreasing estimates of seroprevalence over time, suggesting that assumptions about the probability of vaccinated individuals being identified in serological",1,asymptomatic,True,Test
"surveys in those locations are incompatible with the data collected; in these instances, we excluded the seroprevalence data from the analysis. Fourth, matched seroprevalence surveys with reported cumulative cases, hospitalisations, and deaths provide an interval measure of the IDR, IHR, and IFR from the beginning of the pandemic to the period of the survey. We used these interval measures to derive relationships for the daily IDR, IHR, and IFR. This approach decreases our ability to identify drivers of shorterterm fluctuations in these key rates. Fifth, the availability of hospital admissions data in low-income and middleincome settings was generally low, minimising its effect on the estimation process in many countries. Sixth, we used estimates of total COVID-19 mortality based on the measurement or estimation of excess mortality multiplied by a statistical estimate of the proportion of excess mortality directly attributable to infection with SARS-CoV-2. This statistical estimation was based on removing the effect of a low IDR and reduced mobility that might be a proxy for deferred care and other health effects of isolation. This estimate of the proportion of excess mortality that is total COVID-19 has wide UIs. Eventually, better data will emerge on causes of death during the pandemic that will hopefully refine the estimate of total COVID-19 deaths. The wide uncertainty in the ratio of total COVID-19 to reported COVID-19 is reflected in the uncertainty analysis in this study. Seventh, our model permitted a maximum of two infections per individual--in the case where a person gets an ancestral or alpha variant infection, they might also be infected with a beta, gamma, or delta variant. There is evidence of waning naturally derived immunity, suggesting that an individual might become more broadly susceptible to reinfection sometime after exposure.70",1,case,True,Test
"This empirical analysis of past COVID-19 infections ends at the point where the omicron (B.1.1.529) wave was first detected in Gauteng province in South Africa. Omicron is much more transmissible than previous variants and has shown immune escape.71 Since Nov 14, 2021, the omicron wave has taken off in all countries and territories. Because of much lower severity of disease, the IDR is likely to have dropped considerably during the omicron wave. Models suggest that more than 50% of the world might have been infected with omicron already--however, a detailed analysis will have to await new seroprevalence data emerging in the coming months.

"Background Regular repeat surveillance testing is a strategy to identify asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infections in high-risk work settings to prevent onward community transmission. Saliva sampling is less invasive compared to nasal/oropharyngeal sampling, thus making it suitable for regular testing. In this multi-centre evaluation, we aimed to validate RT-PCR using salivary swab testing of SARS-CoV-2 for large-scale surveillance testing and assess implementation amongst staff working in the hotel quarantine system in Victoria, Australia.",1,asymptomatic,True,Test
"Methods A multi-centre laboratory evaluation study was conducted to systematically validate the in vitro and clinical performance of salivary swab RT-PCR for implementation of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing. Analytical sensitivity for multiple RT-PCR platforms was assessed using a dilution series of known SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, and assay specificity was examined using a panel of viral pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we tested capacity for large-scale saliva testing using a four-sample pooling approach, where positive pools were subsequently decoupled and retested. Regular, frequent self-collected saliva swab RT-PCR testing was implemented for staff across fourteen quarantine hotels. Samples were tested at three diagnostic laboratories validated in this study, and results were provided back to staff in real-time.",1,clinical,True,Test

"Findings The agreement of self-collected saliva swabs for RT-PCR was 84.5% (95% CI 68.6 to 93.8) compared to RTPCR using nasal/oropharyngeal swab samples collected by a healthcare practitioner, when saliva samples were collected within seven days of symptom onset. Between 7th December 2020 and 17th December 2021, almost 500,000 RT-PCR tests were performed on saliva swabs self-collected by 102 staff working in quarantine hotels in Melbourne. Of these, 20 positive saliva swabs were produced by 13 staff (0.004%). The majority of staff that tested positive occurred during periods of community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant.",1,quarantine,True,Test

"We conducted a literature search of peer-reviewed articles published between January 2020 and August 2021 focusing on the utility of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 RTPCR testing for large-scale surveillance. Most studies focused on the usefulness of saliva as an alternative specimen to nasal/oropharyngeal swabbing for patient testing in primary healthcare, mainly in high prevalence settings. To date, there are limited data available on the large-scale utilisation of saliva RT-PCR for routine surveillance testing in high-risk settings, such as staff working in quarantine facilities, particularly during lowprevalence community transmission.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test

For countries such as Australia and New Zealand, these measures helped to maintain a comparatively low prevalence of COVID-19 compared to countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom.2 Between 20th of March 2020 and 1st of November 2021, the Australian international border was only open to travellers with a government-approved exemption, and all returning travellers were required to complete at least 14 days of quarantine in a hotel or another supervised facility.",1,pandemic,True,Test
"In Australia, the first wave of COVID-19 was characterised by multiple incursions of SARS-CoV-2 from returning travellers with limited onward transmission.3 Conversely, until widespread community transmission of the Delta and Omicron variants in late 2021 and early 2022, outbreaks of COVID-19 were largely attributed to transmission from residents within quarantine to hotel staff or fellow residents. Most notably, infection of hotel quarantine staff in the state of Victoria, Australia in mid-2020 led to over 10,000 COVID-19 infections in a large second wave in Victoria.4 Following this outbreak, major changes were made to the hotel quarantine system; these included limiting staff employed in the hotel quarantine system from working across other settings, and improved infection control practices.5 In addition, systematic surveillance testing of staff working in the hotel quarantine system was proposed as a means of early detection of possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from hotel quarantine residents to staff.6",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Saliva has been used as an alternative specimen for diagnostic and screening purposes in the COVID-19 pandemic.7 Compared to nasopharyngeal sampling, saliva collection is less invasive, and a meta-analysis of studies assessing the use of saliva suggested a similar agreement to nasopharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2, although with heterogeneity across studies regarding the populations sampled and the method of saliva collection.8 Previous work in our setting has demonstrated the feasibility of using drooled neat saliva as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs.9 However, neat saliva specimens can be complex to handle in the laboratory, with challenges relating to sample volume and viscosity.7 Saliva sampling using standardised collection devices, although impacted by sample dilution, may help reduce variability between samples; in",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"Setting and study population We performed a retrospective observational study assessing the implementation of salivary RT-PCR testing in hotel quarantine workers in the Victorian capital city of Melbourne (population 4.97 million), Australia. Between March 2020 and November 2021, returning international travellers to Victoria were required to undertake fourteen days of supervised quarantine in designated quarantine hotels. Following the second wave of COVID-19, in Victoria in mid-2020 the hotel quarantine system was managed by COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria (CQV), an agency responsible for overseeing the quarantine programme. As part of this programme, there was a dedicated workforce and daily testing of on-site staff on each day they attended work, with additional voluntary paid testing through community sites on days not attending work. On-site testing was a mix of saliva swabs and combined nasal/oropharyngeal swabs, with the majority of samples being saliva swabs, but at least one sample per week being a nasal/ oropharyngeal swab. There was also voluntary regular testing of staff family members. International arrivals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were transferred to a dedicated quarantine hotel (""health hotel"") managed by Alfred Health, a public healthcare service in Melbourne. To assess the performance of saliva swab RTPCR for surveillance testing in this programme, we conducted a multi-centre in vitro and clinical validation study, led by the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) at the Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity (Melbourne, Australia).

"Implementation of testing programme Implementation of a salivary surveillance testing programme for staff working in the hotel quarantine system commenced on the 7th December 2020 in Melbourne. In total, fourteen hotels were utilised, of which twelve hotels housed returning international and interstate travellers, along with local Victorian residents requiring hotel quarantine facilities (e.g. unable to selfisolate at home), and two hotels accommodated individuals known to be SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive (Supplementary Figure 1). Saliva swab implementation was supported by staff training in saliva swab self-collection using an instructional sheet and a short training video, similar to methods described above. In some instances, this was supervised self-collection. In addition to clinical risk assessment for COVID-19 (daily temperature checks and daily attestations regarding COVID-19 symptoms and potential exposure), weekly nasal/oropharyngeal RT-PCR testing plus salivary swab PCR testing on all other days of onsite work was implemented.

Employees included staff working as floor monitors, drivers, stewards, on-site cleaners and caterers, specimen collection staff, healthcare workers and other authorised staff. Samples were couriered to three diagnostic laboratories undertaking high-throughput salivary swab RT-PCR testing, and results were provided back to individuals (via text message, usually within 12 hours, as these tests were prioritised in the testing system) and to the Victorian Department of Health via electronic laboratory notification. Positive results were called through to the staff member.

"Here, we describe the development and implementation of large-scale salivary RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Melbourne, Australia. Following the second wave of COVID-19 in Melbourne, the hotel quarantine worker testing programme was implemented in December 2020 to coincide with the return of international travel into Melbourne.6 Specifically, the purpose of the testing programme was to prevent incursions of SARS-CoV-2 from returning travellers, via hotel quarantine staff, into the Australian community. In order for widespread surveillance testing to be successful, both the sampling and laboratory testing aspects needed to be scalable, tolerable and accessible. To address this requirement, we developed and implemented a self-collected salivary swab RT-PCR testing method for use across a range of testing platforms and in multiple laboratories.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"In our study, the clinical sensitivity of saliva swab testing compared to nasal/oropharyngeal swabs on individuals within seven days of symptom onset was 84.5% (95% CI 68.6 to 93.8), in keeping with other published work.16,17 Although the sensitivity of saliva testing using swab-based collection is less than that of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs, likely due to factors such as sample dilution and differential viral tropism, previous studies have suggested that increasing the frequency of testing using less sensitive testing approaches may offset the reduction in sensitivity compared to nasal/oropharyngeal RTPCR testing.18,19 As such, high-frequency testing was useful in low disease prevalence settings.19,20 Salivary swab RT-PCR is ideally suited to frequent sampling as it is non-invasive and is amenable to self-collection. Further, because most laboratory workflows using commercial testing platforms are adapted for handling swabs, swab-based saliva testing is suitable for scaling up across diagnostic laboratories, compared to handling neat saliva specimens. Moreover, we found that using pools of four saliva swab samples demonstrated minimal loss of sensitivity and was an effective strategy to increase testing capacity. Other recent studies have used larger pool sizes for salivary RT-PCR surveillance; for example, Mendoza et al. utilised pools of up to 24 neat saliva samples for surveillance testing in schools in New York, allowing testing of over 250,000 saliva specimens over a 20-week period.11 Similarly, Joachim et al. used pooled salivary swab samples from school children in Germany, employing one or two pooled testing groups per class.21 However, one of the key aims of testing hotel quarantine staff is early identification of",1,clinical,True,Test
"possible incursions from returning travellers into the community; as such, in our setting, we chose to use pool sizes of four to allow a balance between scale and sensitivity.",1,community,True,Test
"Since the commencement of the hotel quarantine saliva RT-PCR surveillance programme, approximately 500,000 saliva swabs have been tested in Victoria, with salivary RT-PCR testing validated and deployed at multiple laboratories. Further, salivary swab surveillance testing has subsequently been utilised in other settings in Australia. For example, salivary swab testing was used in the management of the Australian Open international tennis tournament in January 2021 and was extended to surveillance testing of healthcare workers who provide direct care for patients with COVID-19.22 In the healthcare setting, early detection of spread from patients to healthcare workers may prevent onward transmission in both the hospital and community.23,24",1,quarantine,True,Test
"Our study has several limitations. We were unable to collect information on potential false positive and false negative results from all laboratories. However, as part of risk management for the salivary RT-PCR programme, we developed an algorithm to facilitate rapid confirmatory RT-PCR testing by repeat nasal/oropharyngeal swab testing. This algorithm helped to ensure that all positive results obtained using salivary swab testing were confirmed using nasal/oropharyngeal swab RT-PCR testing, thus helping mitigate the risk of false positives, and allowing rapid confirmation of true positive results. In addition, we did not conduct a specific cost-benefit analysis of the salivary swab RT-PCR testing, although work is ongoing in our setting to assess the overall cost-effectiveness of the programme.",1,positive,True,Test
"For most of 2020 and 2021, Australia relied heavily on strict public health measures (including localised lockdowns), and closure of the international border to maintain comparatively low morbidity and mortality rates due to COVID-19.2 Until the emergence and spread of the Delta, and subsequently Omicron variant in Victoria and New South Wales (the country's most populous states), Australia had several periods of successful elimination in 2020 and 2021.4,5 However, to meet the testing demand required for re-opening, scalable and accessible testing approaches became necessary to complement conventional nasal/oropharyngeal RT-PCR, including accessible rapid antigen testing and pooled salivary RT-PCR testing.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

Abstract,0,,False,Test
Background: There are uncertainties about mitigating strategies for swimming-related activities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an opportunity to learn from the experience of previous re-openings to better plan the future one. Our objectives are to systematically review the evidence on (1) the association between engaging in swimming-related activities and COVID-19 transmission; and (2) the effects of strategies for preventing COVID-19 transmission during swimming-related activities.,1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Methods: We conducted a rapid systematic review. We searched in the L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) plat form for COVID-19. The searches covered the period from the inception date of each database until April 19, 2021. We included non-randomized studies for the review on association of COVID-19 transmission and swimming-related activities. We included guidance documents reporting on the strategies for prevention of COVID-19 transmission during swimming-related activities. We also included studies on the efficacy and safety of the strategies. Teams of two reviewers independently assessed article eligibility. For the guidance documents, a single reviewer assessed the eli gibility and a second reviewer verified the judgement. Teams of two reviewers extracted data independently. We sum marized the findings of included studies narratively. We synthesized information from guidance documents according to the identified topics and subtopics, and presented them in tabular and narrative formats.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Results: We identified three studies providing very low certainty evidence for the association between engaging in swimming-related activities and COVID-19 transmission. The analysis of 50 eligible guidance documents identified 11 topics: ensuring social distancing, ensuring personal hygiene, using personal protective equipment, eating and drinking, maintaining the pool, managing frequently touched surfaces, ventilation of indoor spaces, screening and management of sickness, delivering first aid, raising awareness, and vaccination. One study assessing the efficacy of strategies to prevent COVID-19 transmission did not find an association between compliance with precautionary restrictions and COVID-19 transmission.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Conclusions: There are major gaps in the research evidence of relevance to swimming-related activities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the synthesis of the identified strategies from guidance documents can inform public health management strategies for swimming-related activities, particularly in future re-opening plans.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"Background In January 2020, a new coronavirus was identified in China and has since spread worldwide, causing an outbreak. This novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the city of Wuhan in China. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the acute respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 [1]. In March 2020, the WHO declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. It has since triggered a global lockdown and resulted in an unprecedented recession. As of April 2021, it has already infected more than 150 million people and accounted for more than 3 million deaths worldwide [2].",1,coronavirus,True,Test
"In response to the growing pandemic, governments across the world used partial or full lockdowns on their populations as part of the public health efforts to flatten the epidemiologic curve and avoid a surge of cases that would overwhelm their healthcare systems [3, 4]. As part of those lockdowns, airports and educational establishments are closed, businesses, both public and private, are forced to adjust their operations, and most employees are asked to work from home [5].",1,pandemic,True,Test
"Following each lockdown, governments implement reopening plans with a major aim of safely emerging from economic recessions [6]. Those plans include policies and guidance for re-opening public places for outdoor activities, including swimming-related activities. It would be important to learn from the experience of those re-openings, to better plan the future re-opening, e.g., in terms of enhancing mitigating strategies for different activities.",0,,False,Test
"Swimming-related activities are undeniably important for the physical and mental well-being of millions of individuals forced into confinement and isolation for prolonged periods. However, swimming in a pool or a lake, and sunbathing on the beach or shore, imply close proximity between individuals and high frequency of touching common surfaces. These factors would increase the risk of virus transmission. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 is reported to spread through droplet and potentially airborne transmission [7]. Water-borne transmission is still not certain. A well-publicized event was a Fourth of July celebration in a Michigan lake, where individuals contracted COVID-19 [8].",1,isolation,True,Test
The objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence on (1) the association between engaging in swimming-related activities and COVID-19 transmission; and (2) the effects of strategies for preventing COVID-19 transmission during swimming-related activities.,1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Methods We conducted a rapid systematic review to identify, select, abstract, assess, and synthesize the available evidence addressing our questions of interest. We report this rapid systematic review following the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist. We registered the protocol in Open Science Framework (osf.io/38hrw). While we initially aimed to conduct a living systematic review (as stated in the protocol), we opted to conduct a regular (non-living) review due to feasibility issues.",0,,False,Test
"Eligibility criteria For the review of association, the population of interest was the general public. The exposure of interest was engaging in any swimming-related activity, such as going to a pool, a beach, a river or a lake. The outcome of interest was COVID-19 infection. Eligible study designs consisted of non-randomized studies (including cohort studies, case control studies, case series and case reports). We did not have any language restrictions. We excluded environmental studies, mechanistic studies, modeling studies, reviews, letters to the editor, conference abstracts, commentaries and opinion pieces.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"For the review of strategies, we included guidance documents reporting on the prevention of COVID-19 transmission during swimming-related activities. Eligible documents should have provided a substantial description of a strategy. We also included studies of any language on the efficacy and safety of these strategies. We excluded mechanistic studies. We excluded documents that did not address swimming-related activities (e.g., rehabilitation pools, fishing), were only regulatory (i.e., official documents stating the phases of opening), solely referred to other guidance documents, were press releases or were in the form of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"Search strategy For both, the review of association and the review of strategies, we systematically searched in L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that maps PICO questions to a repository developed by Epistemonikos Foundation. This repository is continuously updated through searches in 41 sources including electronic databases, preprint servers, trial registries and other resources relevant to COVID-19.

We ran a search about `swimming-related activities', using the search methods of the COVID-19 L·OVE platform [9]. Additional file 1: Appendix 1 provides the list of terms and databases used in those searches. Additionally, we screened the references of included studies and aimed to screen relevant systematic reviews.",1,trial,True,Test
"For the review of strategies, we also searched the websites of relevant guideline-producing organizations, initially up to June 10, 2020, for relevant guidance documents. We compiled a list of these organizations starting with a list we had developed for another project on guidance documents (unpublished). Also, we searched the International Association for Sports and Leisure Facilities (IAKS) website for news on `pools and aquatic facilities' [10] to identify further organizations. In addition, we identified countries that were easing travel restrictions [11], and searched the websites of every state of the United States (U.S.). Then, we performed a general Google search as well as a Google search restricted to governmental websites (.gov). We used a combination of terms referring to COVID-19 and pools, beaches, rivers and lakes. We also screened the references of included guidance documents.

"Study selection The information matching the search strategy was sent in real-time to the L·OVE platform where at least two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts yielded against the inclusion criteria. We obtained the full texts for all the studies that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria or required further analysis. Then, we judged the eligibility of these studies.

We abstracted from each document all relevant recommendations in detail and analyzed them to identify the topics and subtopics covered. In addition, we abstracted data from studies reporting on efficacy and safety of these strategies. Abstracted data included study population, setting, types of strategies, and data on COVID-19 transmission following the implementation of strategies. We performed the risk of bias assessment using ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized studies and planned to use the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized studies, when applicable.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"We aimed to quantitatively synthesize data on association and data on the effects of strategies. However, this was not possible, and we therefore summarized the findings of included studies narratively. We synthesized information from guidance documents according to the identified topics and subtopics and presented them in tabular and narrative formats. Where applicable, we reported the percentage of guidance documents addressing the topics or subtopics. For topics with high variability or inconsistency, we made sure to present the spectrum of recommendations given.

"Summary of findings In summary, we identified three studies providing very low certainty evidence for the association between engaging in swimming-related activities and COVID-19 transmission. We also identified 50 guidance documents on strategies to prevent COVID-19 transmission during swimming-related activities. The guidance documents addressed the following 11 topics: pool maintenance, social distancing, personal protective equipment (mostly face coverings), managing frequently touched surfaces, eating and/or drinking, first aid, personal hygiene, screening and management of sickness, raising awareness, and vaccination. We identified one study assessing the efficacy of strategies to prevent COVID-19 transmission, showing no association between compliance with precautionary restrictions and transmission. It provided very low certainty evidence. Strengths and limitations This rapid systematic review has a number of strengths. First, we used a very extensive and thorough search strategy across all languages. Through using the COVID-19 L·OVE platform, we were able to utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to search, deduplicate search results, and identify potentially eligible studies in real time (given the continuous update of the platform). A team of diverse experienced reviewers finalized the selection, data abstraction and synthesis steps. Also, we searched for guidance documents through checking the websites of all states in the U.S., of countries easing travel restrictions and of associations concerned",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"with sports and leisure activities. Although we conducted a rapid review, we followed standard methods of conducting systematic reviews to a large extent [16, 17]. One limitation of this study is that we did not include mechanistic or environmental studies. Another limitation is that the search for the guidance documents was not systematic. A major limitation is that the included guidance documents were not formally developed guidelines (i.e., would not meet the criteria of trustworthy guidelines, or score well on the AGREE II tool). Another limitation is that some of the guidance documents focused on a specific phase of reopening, and could have been later on modified, e.g., to address another phase of the reopening. However, our summarized strategies reflect the most recent guidance available at the time of our data retrieval.",0,,False,Test
"Interpretation of findings Our findings show a major gap in the research evidence on the association between engaging in swimmingrelated activities and COVID-19 transmission, and on the efficacy and safety of strategies related to this topic. This is consistent with research on transmission through other activities including singing and playing wind instruments [18].",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"To a large extent, the documents were consistent particularly in relation to the broad principles of social distancing, use of PPE, personal hygiene, and cleaning surfaces. Documents also commonly highlighted measures addressing individuals considered high risk (e.g. older adults). However, there were some variability, and even some inconsistencies in how exactly to apply those principles. For example, there was some variability in how to implement `capacity control' as part of `ensuring social distancing'. Guidance documents proposed one or more of a number of ways of defining maximum capacity, e.g. as a percentage, persons per square meter of surface area, maximum fixed number of persons, or other. Areas with clear inconsistences were opening versus closing food services; keeping drinking fountains functional versus suspending their use; allowing versus banning specific activities (e.g. swimming classes), and lifeguard duties (whether or not they include enforcing social distancing).",1,social,True,Test
"Implications for public health practice In light of the scarce evidence on the association of COVID-19 transmission with swimming-related activities, or on the effectiveness of mitigating interventions, the synthesis of the identified strategies from guidance documents can inform public health management strategies for swimming-related activities, particularly in future re-opening plans. In addition, pool managers and operators should take into account the relevance, acceptability, feasibility, availability of resources, and prevalence",1,COVID-19,True,Test

"Implications for research There is a need for evidence on the association of COVID-19 transmission and engaging in swimmingrelated activities and on the efficacy and safety of the proposed strategies. Although we found scarce evidence for swimming-related activities, we are aware of the availability of streams of evidence from other contexts (e.g. mode of transmission in healthcare setting or community) and from other types of studies (e.g., mechanistic and modeling studies) that could be relevant to our topic. One can build on those streams of evidence to support an analytical framework addressing the different activities and exposures, mode of transmission, mitigating factors and modifying factors for COVID-19 in swimmingrelated activities.",1,COVID-19,True,Test

Abstract,0,,False,Test
"In this paper, we replace the standard numerical approach of estimating parameters in a mathematical model using numerical solvers for differential equations with a physics-informed neural network (PINN). This neural network requires a sequence of time instances as direct input of the network and the numbers of susceptibles, vaccinated, infected, hospitalized, and recovered individuals per time instance to learn certain parameters of the underlying model, which are used for the loss calculations.",0,,False,Test
"The established model is an extended susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model in which the transitions between disease-related population groups, called compartments, and the physical laws of epidemic transmission dynamics are expressed by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The system of ODEs and its time derivative are included in the residual loss function of the PINN in addition to the data error between the current network output and the time series data of the compartment sizes. Further, we illustrate how this PINN approach can also be used for differential equation-based models such as the proposed extended SIR model, called SVIHR model.",1,disease,True,Test
"In a validation process, we compare the performance of the PINN with results obtained with the numerical technique of non-standard finite differences (NSFD) in generating future COVID-19 scenarios based on the parameters identified by the PINN.

"The COVID-19 pandemic is currently one of the most discussed topics worldwide. The first cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Asia in December 2019, but they were not reliably identified then. The People's Republic of China experienced a peak of about 4600 cases per day in mid-February 2020, but by March 2020, the epidemic was largely contained in China and other Asian parts of the world. Europe experienced the first wave of the pandemic in March and April 2020, with, for example, about 5840 new daily infections in Germany in late March and 13,260 new daily infections in France in mid-April 2020.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"While infection numbers in Europe were generally low in the summer of 2020, peaks were observed in the United States (67,000 infections/day), Brazil (46,000 infections/day), and India (93,000 infections/day) at certain times between July and September 2020. The third wave was characterized by approximately 35,000 new daily infections in Italy in mid-November 2020, 25,000 new daily infections in Germany around Christmas, 60,000 new daily infections in the United Kingdom in early January 2021, and severe lockdowns within Europe in fall 2020 and winter 2020/2021. The summer of 2021 was characterized by a relaxation of intervention measures in Europe. However, some countries experienced catastrophic COVID-19 events, such as India, with approximately 390,000 new daily infections in early May 2021 [16].",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"In November 2021, the fourth wave of the pandemic spread throughout Europe despite a fully vaccinated proportion of 67.6% in Germany, 68.9% in the United Kingdom, 74.8% in Italy, 77.7% in France, and 80.6% in Portugal [23]. Nearly 40,000 new daily infections were observed in Germany on November 14th 2021, as well as in the United Kingdom. Achieving even higher vaccination rates and providing booster vaccinations for all to maintain a high level of infection protection are policy issues of concern to all countries. The dangers posed by mutant virus variants such as the delta variant (B.1.617.2), which was first discovered in India in October 2020 and is now the dominant variant infecting people in several countries such as Germany, or the omicron variant (B.1.1.529) discovered in the autumn of 2021, are also being discussed in medicine and the literature. According to the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI), the mRNA vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca are expected to have a protective effect of approximately 90% against severe infection with the alpha (B.1.1.7) variant and 75% against symptomatic infection with the delta (B.1.617.2) variant [20].",1,pandemic,True,Test
"The mathematical model used in this work to describe the population dynamics of COVID-19 is an SVIHR model. It is based on a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Most mathematical models describing the spread of the disease employ classical compartments in which the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) structure is the most basic form of [2]. Mathematical modeling helps forecast the dynamics of infectious diseases. Over the past nearly two years, a variety of compartmental models have been introduced as enhanced SIR models to study various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"It is clear that SIR models make simplifying assumptions about the population and disease process, which may be a reason to critically question and debate them. A study by Kharazmi et al. showed that a general disadvantage of COVID-19 models was the treatment of key parameter values as being fixed over time [10]. There are alternative methods to predict the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, including fitting curves to empirically",1,disease,True,Test

"observed data and solely data-driven non-numerical approaches. We always must keep in mind that the novelty of SARS-CoV-2 leads to many uncertainties in all modeling attempts due to biological features of transmission, viral mutations, pathogen behavior, and, of course, the unknown exact number of infections [10]. Moreover, no method can optimally predict the future, but a good model provides an approximation that is accurate enough to be useful for informing public policy [25]. The advantage of PINNs, which use physical laws governing the system in the form of equations, is the ability to be retrained as new data is collected and update the models over time with inferred parameters [10]. SIR-type models add a mathematical indication to a neural network, such that the exclusive data-drivenness is sustained with systematic knowledge of the disease transmission and behavior of the population. Depending on the number and kinds of used compartments and model parameters and their definition, an SIR-type model can be adapted to specific targets one has with respect to implementation. This can, for instance, be the estimation of future hospital occupancy, the influence of specific intervention measures, and isolation rates or the rate of asymptomatic infections. Respective transition rates can be fit into the model. The targets of the implementations and suitability of a certain model depend on the region or country used for data assimilation because of different conditions and disease spreads in distinct regions. In our approach, the country Germany is used for data collection and as the basis of model establishment, and our focus lies on infection and hospitalization numbers.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"In this paper, we do not establish the simplest version of the compartment model. Instead, we develop some kind of extended model, which complements the basic SIR model by a vaccinated and a hospitalized class. The hospitalized compartment is added due to the high significance of hospitalization number predictions for hospital capacity planning and the assessment of the number of severely diseased individuals during pandemic times. We do not include an exposed compartment, which is a possible first enhancement to the SIR model and incorporates infected people who are not (yet) infectious, that is, those with pre-symptomatic and potentially asymptomatic individuals.",1,disease,True,Test
"In our model, pre-symptomatic individuals are condensed with symptomatic people in the infected compartment, so that we have a single infected compartment of people not hospitalized. Since determining the proportion of asymptomatic individuals in the total infected population is not our goal at this point, we do not include a class of infected individuals who are asymptomatic, but assume at least very mild symptoms in infected individuals. The degree of infectivity of infected individuals can be controlled by adjusting the transmission rate in the model.",1,symptomatic,True,Test
"Our model includes a vaccination rate and the proportion of the population vaccinated each week. Therefore, the model is adaptable to different vaccination scenarios. In addition, the general transmissibilities of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, which are constantly changing, lead to altered protective effects of available vaccines. The established model includes a transmission rate explained in Sect. 2.",1,SARS-CoV-2,True,Test
"The main method used in this work, called Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and explained in Sect. 3.1, is used to estimate the transmission rate based on the data available in Germany. The PINN itself combines a data-driven method (here based on compartment size data, e.g., number of infections) with the developed ODE system so that it incorporates physical laws. In other words, this approach trades off between the data-based and physical loss functions in the training process. This reduces the space of",1,transmission,True,Test

"feasible solutions to those that satisfy a `physical law' to some degree, i.e., an SVIHR compartmental model in this case. The ODE system corresponding to the model serves as an additional constraint in the training phase encoded by an appropriate additional residual loss term. More specifically, the PINN loss function consists of the two weighted terms data loss and residual loss. The data loss is calculated as the difference between the current network output in terms of infection or hospitalization numbers and the reported 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) data covering weeks between March 2020 and December 2021. The residual loss is based on a mathematical model with a system of ordinary differential equations that describes the main population dynamics observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. A PINN approach for the simple SIRD model was proposed by Malinzi et al. [11], and a PINN approach for an SIR-based vaccination model was described by Torku et al. [26]. In contrast, Zeroual et al. [28] compared different pure deep learning models for forecasting COVID-19 cases and found the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) algorithm to be superior.",1,case,True,Test
"Raissi et al. [17] explain that PINNs are neural networks that embed physics as a regularization term in the loss function. They say that given a sufficient number of data points and an expressive neural network architecture, they can achieve good approximation accuracy if the given differential equation is well-posed and has a unique solution. PINNs can also be viewed as a surrogate model for solving differential equations by incorporating additional data or as a data-driven correction (or even discovery) of the underlying physical system. One motivation for this hybrid approach can be seen in the observed non-compliance of some individuals with social distancing (or physical distancing) and hygiene rules. This behavior is difficult to formulate in ODEs, but it is included in the neural network training data.",1,social,True,Test
"Olumoyin et al. [15] use the term Epidemiology-Informed Neural Network (EINN), which describes a type of feedforward neural network that incorporates epidemiological dynamics such as lockdown into its loss function. Their EINN learns solutions for the so-called asymptomatic SIR model, i.e., the proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals to the total number of infected individuals.",1,Epidemiology,True,Test
"Shaier et al. [22] use the term Disease-Informed Neural Networks (DINN) to refer to a type of PINN-based neural network that can be applied to increasingly complex systems of differential equations describing various known infectious diseases. The DINN formulation learns both the representation of the underlying system as a neural network and also performs a calibration (called `Inverse Parameter Estimation') for the assumed ODE system model. In this way, it can be used to predict the infection rates, etc.",1,Disease,True,Test
"As our PINN operates based on transmission and transition dynamics in a population affected by COVID-19, estimates transmission rate parameters, and incorporates a transmission rate that can incorporate remedial measures, such as quarantine and contact restrictions, our PINN can be described as a special type of EINN designed to predict COVID-19 incidence. Because our PINN uses a system of differential equations to learn the parameters that generate it, this PINN can also be considered a DINN. Our approach of using PINN-identified parameters of an ODE system to predict infection and hospitalization rates by using the PINN itself in a slightly modified form and a numerical method of NSFD is innovative. The uniqueness of our approach lies in the fact that we use our PINN for parameter identification and give it a second input of initial compartment size data to generate accurate future compartment size scenarios, and then apply a purely nu-",1,transmission,True,Test

"The data used consist of infection and hospitalization rates as well as vaccination, death, and cure rates for Germany obtained from the RKI [18, 19]. The PINN also works based on the established dynamic ODE system, which forms the core of the model and is developed in Sect. 2. The transmission rate is one of the most important parameters affecting the occurrence of infections and thus the established ODE system. Therefore, changes in transmissibility due to mutations or altered susceptibility of the underlying population are part of the model-based predictions.",1,transmission,True,Test
"The exact procedures used in this work are described in Sect. 3.2 and Sect. 3. In this work, the estimation of certain model-specific parameters is performed by the PINN mentioned above.

"2 Model structure In this work, an SVIHR compartmental model was developed based on the basic SIR model introduced by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927. The SIR model consists of three compartments of susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R) individuals. Susceptible individuals have not yet become infected but may become ill. Infected individuals have already become infected. In the basic SIR model, they can also infect susceptible persons. Therefore, they are assumed to be infectious and may or may not have symptoms. Recovered individuals have overcome the disease and are no longer ill.",1,infectious,True,Test
"2.1 The SIR model in epidemiology The basic SIR model assumes that no births or deaths enter the system, that the population is closed so that no one enters or leaves a compartment from the outside, and that recovered individuals are completely immune so that they can never be reinfected.

The interested reader may also check that the equilibrium points of the ODE model also appear in the proposed NSFD-scheme. We recall that schemes such as those based on Runge-Kutta methods [5] can produce `false' or `spurious' fixed-points, which are not fixed points of the original ODE system, cf. [14]. Finally, we will determine the so-called denominator function, such that we obtain the correct long-time behavior. We refer to [27], where we established an NSFD scheme for a similar compartment model as here. We implemented a simultaneous parameter estimation using a nonlinear least squares minimization of the error between time series compartment size data and the result of the NSFD-based integration of the respective system of ODEs. This does not equal the data or residual loss of our PINN approach used in this paper. With the optimized parameters and the NSFD scheme, we generated future COVID-19 scenarios.

Values of the two trainable parameters obtained from PINN are later used as the inputs to further Python codes used for the formation of future SARS-CoV-2 scenarios.

"Our PINN uses labeled training data, i.e., compartment sizes K^ assigned to specific weeks ti, i  {1, . . . , l}, in every training iteration. As training data are not unlabeled here, we cannot describe our PINN approach as an unsupervised neural network. Nonetheless, our PINN is not a typical kind of supervised classification network but learns the course of an infectious disease in a data- and model-driven way. As a consequence, our validation does not consist of a sensitivity or specificity analysis, which is typically conducted for supervised neural networks. We focus on the investigation of the predicted trends with their local maxima and minima during the course of the pandemic from August 2021. We also compute errors to be able to more specifically compare the results obtained with different weighting parameter values.",1,infectious,True,Test
"The time period that predictions refer to, which is 27 or 35 calendar weeks here, always has to be considered. A predicted time period of half or two-thirds of a year is reasonable with respect to COVID-19 scenarios because it covers approximately one large wave of the pandemic, which may have several local peaks and usually has one global peak. So in the context of COVID-19, the term long-term prediction can be associated with the prediction of one following wave that is dominated by infections with a specific variant of the virus. A short-term prediction can be described as a forecast of e.g. the next local peak within a wave then. Another interpretation of a short-term prediction is a forecast based on certain most current data, which could be data referring to the last experienced wave or high peak during the pandemic. In our following validation, we do not restrict the training data to the most recent peak of the omicron wave but still incorporate all three experienced peaks during the omicron wave into our training data. A corresponding aim is that the PINN shall be able to foresee peaks in the height of the ones substantially caused by omicron infections and is simultaneously adapted to various virus variants.",1,COVID-19,True,Test
"It is also significant to consider the data set with which the training procedure works. Depending on different viral mutations and also state intervention or compliance of the population during the pandemic, the underlying data set varies, certain parameters in the system of ODEs must be adapted, and possible predictions change.

"5 Conclusion and outlook We have presented a data- and physics-driven deep learning algorithm that identifies the transmission parameter  and the parameter , which represents the proportion of transmissibility in the vaccinated population, in a system of ordinary differential equations of a compartmental model describing population dynamics at pandemic times.

"Depending on the choice of the transmission rate, the performance of the NSFD scheme varies in approximating the course of the pandemic. Slight changes can lead to large changes in the prediction in terms of the slope and the height reached by the peak of the curve. For example, a 4 · 10-10 increase in transmission risk from 2.00 · 10-9 to 2.04 · 10-9 resulted in a maximum reached two weeks earlier and 0.32 · 106 higher, and a 2 · 10-10 decrease in risk from 2.00 · 10-9 to 1.98 · 10-9 resulted in a maximum reached one week later and 0.9 · 105 smaller (see Fig. 3). The scenarios drawn in our validation part can be described as long-term predictions in the way that data from the outbreak of the pandemic in Germany until the end of 2021 are used in the training set. We did not include data from just a single peak within a wave or a single wave here, as we wanted an algorithm that was adapted to a wide range of virus variants. It should also be adapted to the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in all four seasons, which would not be given if only one wave or even one local peak were included in the training data.",1,transmission,True,Test
"PINN seem better suited to account for multiple local maxima within a wave than the NSFD scheme, as it is able to capture outliers or small oscillations in a given set of real infection or hospitalisation data and transfer them into its prediction. The clear advantage of PINN over discrete numerical methods is its data orientation, so that it does not rely solely on a mathematical model described by a system of differential equations, which certainly cannot capture all aspects or dynamics of infectious disease. The importance of data loss is evidenced by the fact that predictions of our PINN with assignments  > 0.9, i.e., a clearly dominant influence of the data error MSEU , led to resulting curve predictions that were closer to the reported data of the 30 weeks considered than with assignments  < 0.9. Indeed, our results, particularly those in Table 1, show a sharp decline in PINN performance for decreasing values of the weighting parameter.",1,infectious,True,Test
"With regard to the prediction of the NSFD scheme, the inclusion of time variability in the transmission rate showed that the NSFD scheme is able to accommodate the prediction of more than one wave, each with a maximum. It is important that the parameters used in the time-dependent transmission function are chosen appropriately. If the NSFD scheme were to be used for an actual prediction of the next wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the parameters c would need to be reliably estimated.",1,transmission,True,Test
"Nevertheless, the residual term allows us to incorporate systematic knowledge about the spread and transmission dynamics of the disease into our neural network. The differential equations make the network a physically informed and partially mathematical approach. No mathematical model is able to perfectly describe an infectious disease such as COVID-19 because, for example, new mutant variants emerge and intervention measures or population compliance change over time, and not every epidemiological detail relevant to transmission is known. However, the values of certain fixed parameters can be derived from elaborate studies, knowledge of a possible next mutation, intervention, or vaccination strategy can be incorporated, and SIR-type models provide clues to transition dynamics that the neural network can work with. Our variant of the SIR model, i.e., the SVIHR model, was developed because we wanted to include leaky vaccination to account for the reduced infectiousness of individuals in the fully vaccinated case, and we wanted",1,spread,True,Test

"SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), a virus causing severe acute respiratory disease in humans, emerged in late 2019. This respiratory virus can spread via aerosols, fomites, contaminated hands or surfaces as for other coronaviruses. Studying their persistence under different environmental conditions represents a key step for better understanding the virus transmission. This work aimed to present a reproducible procedure for collecting data of stability and inactivation kinetics from the scientific literature. The aim was to identify data useful for characterizing the persistence of viruses in the food production plants. As a result, a large dataset related to persistence on matrices or in liquid media under different environmental conditions is presented. This procedure, combining bibliographic survey, data digitalization techniques and predictive microbiological modelling, identified 65 research articles providing 455 coronaviruses kinetics. A ranking step as well as a technical validation with a Gage Repeatability & Reproducibility process were performed to check the quality of the kinetics.

"The first cases of coronaviruses disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in China in December 2019 and spread afterwards quickly around different countries from around January-February 20201. From the first months of viral dissemination, SARS-CoV-2 clusters were observed, in particular in occupational environments for several essential sectors such as health care centres2,3 or food processing plants4-7. The transmission of coronaviruses among humans was reported as possibly through aerosol (inhalation of aerosolized or falling contaminated droplets) or through contact (hand, objects or surfaces)8,9. Infected persons (symptomatic or asymptomatic) can send out several contaminated droplets that could stay in aerosol, be directly inhaled or fall on surfaces and potentially infect afterwards other persons. However, the changes of the infectious viral load in the contaminated droplets susceptible to be inhaled and to induce disease are not well known in either aerosol or surfaces. Furthermore, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 depends on environmental conditions that are very different from one occupational location to another10,11. Some factors such as airflow, ventilation, temperature and relative humidity modify the probability of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through respiratory pathways since it can affect droplet movements and virus survival, notably through droplet desiccation12. Some studies reported the influence of few temperature and/or relative humidity conditions. For example, the virus remains infectious for longer periods at lower temperatures and very high relative humidity10, metal surfaces such as stainless steel could allow the virus to remain infectious longer than on others under some specific temperature-humidity conditions13,14. Studies on coronaviruses persistence were generally conducted by experiments in laboratory consisting in monitoring the virus kinetics under controlled conditions. The reduction of virus infectivity over time could be evaluated by fitting inactivation mathematical models on experimental data. Studying the effects of environmental conditions encountered in food premises requires collecting kinetics data as exhaustively as",1,case,True,Test

Afterwards, an inactivation primary model was fitted on each kinetics to estimate the viral infectivity reduction parameter and its uncertainty (Step 3).

It is worth noting that kinetics for coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2 collected in these studies were also retained for analyses.",1,coronavirus,True,Test
"Several information associated with the above kinetics were gathered in an Excel spreadsheet (more details in the Data records section). For each identified kinetics, we assigned a unique kinetics key. The virus Strains, Species, Subgenus and Genus were indicated for each kinetics, as well as other conditions such as the nature of the materials (stainless steel, plastic, paper,...), the medium (liquid media, aerosol, porous and non-porous surfaces), temperature and relative humidity (expressed in range and or median value), pH (if available) etc. Other information was also indicated for each kinetics such as the initial virus load, the type of cell used for infectious viral titration (Vero, etc.) or the number of experimental replicates. Table 2 provides an overview of the extracted kinetics from SARS-CoV-2 studies, the Table 3 from studies for other coronaviruses.",1,spread,True,Test
"Data extraction. The persistence kinetics data were taken from texts, tables or figures in the research papers identified above. Data from tables or texts were manually filled into the database. Raw data from figures were extracted using the R package metadigitize78.

For reproducibility purposes, all files associated with raw digitalizations of our study are provided and detailed in the Data records section. The monitored time points extracted from all studies (extractions from tables or figures digitalization) were converted and expressed in hours in order to homogenize for comparative purposes between studies.",0,,False,Test
"Viral infectivity reduction parameter. The third step aimed to estimate a parameter to characterize the viral infectivity reduction for each kinetics (condition).

"Evaluation of kinetics quality. In this work, kinetics data were collected from different publications in which the laboratory experiments were not conducted with the same design. These data represented then important variabilities, e.g. in terms of number of time points, replicates, etc. Therefore, criteria can be useful to evaluate and classify the quality of the collected kinetics. Indeed, the quality of raw data was susceptible to influence the statistical estimation of D. Criteria-based ranking approaches have been proposed in some predictive microbiology studies aiming to deal with difficulties in terms of data selection (inclusion or exclusion for modelling)83,84. Herein, for the establishment of a quality score by kinetics, we considered three criteria: (i) the number of the time points of the kinetics; (ii) the importance of the extracted point considering if it represented a single value or multiple measure (i.e. at least two technical replicates); and (iii) the value of the coefficient of variation (CV) of the estimated value of D, characterizing the fit quality of the inactivation model. For each kinetics, we attributed three scores corresponding to these three criteria and classified them into different categories. It is worth noting that ones can arbitrarily define the threshold values separating these categories as well as the given corresponding score values depending on the studies and the extracted dataset. In our work, for each kinetics, the score associated with the number of time points, denoted s1, was firstly defined as follows:",1,flu,True,Test

"The technical validation focused on the figures' digitalization step, since the latter remained a manual work that could probably vary from one user to another. In order to check the quality of the data collected by digitalization, this step was re-conducted repeatedly by three independent users for evaluating its repeatability and its reproducibility. This checking procedure was performed on a random sample of eleven kinetics among those collected, and each kinetics was digitalized three times per user. The values of the parameter D were afterwards estimated as described in previous sections. The comparison between the values of D estimated by different users was firstly done by fitting the major axis regression model on bootstrap data generated for each pair of users86,87. Afterwards, the Gage R&R tool from the R package SixSigma88,89 was used in order to identify and quantify the error parts in the estimated values of log_10 D due to the user repeatability as well as the between user reproducibility, respectively. The R scripts and data associated with the technical validation procedure are provided (see the `Code Availability' section below).",0,,False,Test
"As illustration, the comparison between users (denoted user 1, 2 and 3, respectively) by major axis regression is plotted in Fig. 3 (user 1, plotted in the X-axis, was arbitrarily chosen herein as the reference one for comparison). The results of the Gage R&R analysis showed a good repeatability: the latter estimated a very low error part due to intra-user variation, estimated at only 0.01% of the overall variation. The error part due to the between-users variation was estimated at 1.5%. After confrontation between experimenters, this part of inter-users error can be explained by the difficulties for choosing the points to be digitalized. Indeed points below the limit of quantification (LOQ) should not be included for avoiding bias. This choice could then strongly influence the estimation of log10 D as illustrated in Fig. 3, since this parameter conditioned the slope of the",1,flu,True,Test
