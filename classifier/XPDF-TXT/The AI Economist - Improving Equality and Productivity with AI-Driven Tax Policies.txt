Abstract
Tackling real-world socio-economic challenges requires designing and testing economic policies. However, this is hard in practice, due to a lack of appropriate (micro-level) economic data and limited opportunity to experiment. In this work, we train social planners that discover tax policies in dynamic economies that can effectively trade-off economic equality and productivity. We propose a two-level deep reinforcement learning approach to learn dynamic tax policies, based on economic simulations in which both agents and a government learn and adapt. Our data-driven approach does not make use of economic modeling assumptions, and learns from observational data alone. We make four main contributions. First, we present an economic simulation environment that features competitive pressures and market dynamics. We validate the simulation by showing that baseline tax systems perform in a way that is consistent with economic theory, including in regard to learned agent behaviors and specializations. Second, we show that AI-driven tax policies improve the trade-off between equality and productivity by % over baseline policies, including the prominent Saez tax framework. Third, we showcase several emergent features: AI-driven tax policies are qualitatively different from baselines, setting a higher top tax rate and higher net subsidies for low incomes. Moreover, AI-driven tax policies perform strongly in the face of emergent tax-gaming strategies learned by AI agents. Lastly, AI-driven tax policies are also effective when used in experiments with human participants. In experiments conducted on MTurk, an AI tax policy provides an equality-productivity trade-off that is similar to that provided by the Saez framework along with higher inverse-income weighted social welfare.

Introduction
Economic inequality is accelerating globally and is a key social and economic concern. Many studies have shown that large income inequality gaps can have significant negative effects, leading for example to diminished economic opportunity [United Nations, ] and adverse health effects [Subramanian and Kawachi, ]. In this light, tax policy provides governments with an important tool to reduce inequality, supporting the possibility of the redistribution of wealth through government provided services and benefits. And yet, finding the optimal tax policy is challenging. The basic reason is that while more taxation can improve equality, taxation can also discourage people from working, leading to lower productivity.
The problem of optimally balancing equality and productivity has not been solved for general economic settings, and even when the policy objectives can be agreed upon. Part of the challenge is that is hard to experiment with real-world tax policies. In the place of experimentation, economic theory often relies on simplifying assumptions that are hard to validate, for example about people's sensitivity to taxes. Tax systems that have been proposed range from no taxes at all ("free market"), to progressive and regressive tax systems (reflecting whether the tax rate increases or decreases as income increases), to total redistribution.
In this paper, we introduce "The AI Economist," a two-level deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train social planners. The economic actors are adaptive, learning behaviors in the simulated world and including in response to tax policy. The planner is also adaptive, learning tax policies that adapt to agent behaviors and seek to achieve a particular policy objective. Neither economic actors nor the AI Economist have prior knowledge, whether about the simulated world environment or economic theory. The AI Economist learns a tax policy based only on observable data and without knowledge of the skill or utility functions of workers or prior assumptions about the behavior of workers, and can be used to optimize for any desired social outcome.
The AI Economist learns a tax schedule, analogous to the way in which US federal income taxes are described. Taxes are computed by applying a tax rate to each part of an individual's income that falls within a tax bracket. For simplicity, we fix the intervals that correspond to each of these income brackets and learn the tax rate for each bracket. The tax schedule learned by the AI Economist is not personalized; each agent faces the same rates and bracket cutoffs. In a single tax period the tax schedule is determined via a deep neural network, able to observe all public information about the world, including the position, income, and resources held by agents.
Our approach to economic design is based on the use of simulations, making use of AI agents that learn optimal behaviors. This use of simulation enables the testing of economic policies at large-scale, and including the ability to measure a range of different metrics. In effect, we can compare the performance of millions of economic designs, making use of economic agents whose behavior is learned in parallel. The simulation framework can also be used to speed up experiments with existing proposals for tax systems, validating assumptions and offering the ability to test ideas that come from economic theory.
We make the following contributions:
· We introduce a principled economic simulation that features competitive pressures, trade, and resource scarcity.
· We validate that learned behavior conforms to results known from economic theory, for example agent specialization.
· We frame the problem of learning optimal taxes in a dynamic economy as a two-level, inner-outer reinforcement learning problem and describe a range of techniques to stabilize training for this two-level RL problem, including the use of learning curricula and entropy-based regularization.

· The AI-driven tax policies make use of different kinds of tax rate schedules than those suggested by baseline policies, and our experiments demonstrate that the AI-driven tax policy can improve the trade-off between equality and productivity by % when compared to the prominent Saez tax framework.
· We show that AI agents can learn tax-avoidance behaviors, modulating their incomes across tax periods. The tax schedule generated by the AI Economist performs well despite this kind of strategic behavior.
· Without endorsing the particular tax schedules, we show that a learned policy can also be effective in experiments with human participants and without additional recalibration. The policy achieves an equality-productivity trade-off that is competitive with the state-of-the-art, together with higher inverse-income weighted social welfare. This provides a preliminary suggestion that the AI Economist methodology could also be applicable to more general, real world settings.
. Related Work
Optimal Taxation. In economics, optimal tax theory is the study of the design of a tax system that maximizes a social welfare function subject to a set of economic constraints, while accounting for the fact that individuals respond to taxes and transfers [Mankiw et al., , Diamond and Saez, ]. The core challenge in the design of optimal tax policies is that taxes and transfers can affect incentives to work, creating a trade-off between equality and productivity [Mankiw et al., , Diamond and Saez, ]. A particular concern is that high income may correlate with high skill, leading higher skilled workers to choose to work less.
Ramsey [ ]'s early work tied consumption taxes on a good to a representative consumer's elasticity of demand for the good. The current dominant theoretical framework arose out of a series of papers by Mirrlees and Diamond [Diamond and Mirrlees, a,b, Mirrlees, ]. These authors consider a utilitarian social planner--aiming to maximize the sum of individual utilities in a society. Saez [ ] builds on the Mirrlees framework to derive optimal non-linear tax rates using models of the elasticity of earnings with respect to tax rates, together with the shape of the income distribution.
Other work has expanded upon the Mirrlees framework to argue for a tax system that tries to achieve a broader distributive justice [Piketty and Saez, , Piketty et al., , Saez and Stantcheva, ], or a tax system in which the payments made by an individual merely match the benefits received [Mankiw et al., , Mankiw, , Mankiw and Weinzierl, ].
The Mirrlees model is limited to optimal taxation in a single tax period, without considering dynamics, for example the income histories of individuals in deciding taxes, or events with longer-term effects such as education. The new dynamic public finance (NDPF) expands upon these frameworks to consider dynamic economies, capturing additional real world effects, for example, allowing for the coordinated taxation of capital and labor income [Golosov et al., , Kocherlakota, , Albanesi and Sleet, , Kocherlakota,
]. Progress in optimal taxation theory has also come through a growing empirical and experimental literature. This includes work that seeks to estimate labor supply elasticity to changes in taxation and redistribution [Gruber and Saez, , Chetty, , Goldberg, ], and work that seeks to understand the behavioral response of workers to tax policy through the use of cross-sectional data on taxation, labor supply, and individual incomes [Slemrod, , Goolsbee, , Alesina et al., ]. Research in behavioral public finance [McCaffery and Slemrod, , Kuziemko et al., , Alesina et al., ] makes use of experiments and surveys to understand how people respond to different theories of taxation, redistribution, and public spending. Our work adopts baselines from optimal taxation theory, by comparing the performance of the AI Economist with tax policies that arise from the Saez framework, in this case, making use of estimated labor elasticities in our simulated economies.

Agent-based Modeling. Agent-based modeling (ABM) research [Holland and Miller, , Bonabeau, ] creates simulations of agents and institutions that interact through prescribed rules. ABM does not rely on standard equilibrium models. Rather, it allows for dynamic, nonlinear behavior by agents and institutions, and can adopt behavioral rules that are deduced from human experiments [Arthur, ].
The idea is to use ABM to enable policy-makers to simulate an artificial economy under different policy scenarios, and quantitatively explore their consequences [Farmer and Foley, ]. ABM has been applied to study tax compliance [Bloomquist, , Miguel et al., , Subburaj and Rao, ], and to derive optimal taxation policy [Garrido and Mittone, ], based on heuristics and simple learning methods. Wider adoption of ABM has proved challenging due to the complexity of realistically modeling human behavior and the economy.
While our motivations are similar to ABM, our framework makes use of deep RL to optimize the behaviors of economic agents with the effect that we study policy design in the presence of rational agent behavior.
Reinforcement Learning. Our learning approach relates to multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In MARL, agents need to learn together with other learning agents, creating a non-stationary environment [Laurent et al., ]. This poses a challenge to the standard approach of learning from exploration [Sutton and Barto, a], since agents can easily mistake other agents' exploration as environment randomness [Claus and Boutilier, ]. A particular challenge presented by the AI Economist is that it presents a two-level learning problem, in which the social planner learns a tax policy simultaneously with agents who learn how to optimize their behavior. In effect, agents face a continuously changing reward function. As a consequence, past optimal behavior might not be optimal at later times, which can present a significant learning challenge.
MARL has been effective in learning emergent cooperation in large-scale experiments on complex environments [Bansal et al., , Jaderberg et al., , OpenAI, ]. Previous MARL algorithms have sought to stabilize multi-agent learning by explicitly modeling missing state or policy information [Lowe et al., , Tacchetti et al., , Shu and Tian, ], or assuming some information is shared between agents, including the internal or global state or rewards [Sunehag et al., , Foerster et al., , Peysakhovich and Lerer, , Hughes et al., , Letcher et al., , Balduzzi et al., ].
In the present paper, we insist on each agent having a policy that only makes use of information that it can individually observe. To make learning efficient, we allow for weight sharing during training. Learned agent behaviors remain distinct, as a result of distinct local states, for example, location in the world, skill, and endowment of resources. This presents a hybrid approach, improving learning efficiency without assuming information or state sharing between agents.
Optimal taxation can be seen as a form of reward shaping, which has found a role in preventing undesired social outcomes in multi-agent systems, such as unsustainable resource collection in tragedy-of-the-commons style social dilemmas [Leibo et al., ]. Reward shaping has also been shown to induce cooperation in spatiotemporal games [Mguni et al., , Hughes et al., , Jaques et al., ]. However, these works do not consider the kinds of economic environments we study here, do not consider the design of tax policies, and make use of manually-crafted reward shaping.
Machine learning for Economic Design. The problem of automated mechanism design was first formalized by Conitzer and Sandholm [ , ], and there are polynomial time algorithms for the design of Bayesian incentive-compatible, optimal auctions [Cai et al., a,b, ]. Dütting et al. [ ] were the first to study the use of deep machine learning for the design of the allocation and payment rules of revenue-optimal auctions. By insisting on incentive-compatible or approximately incentive-compatible designs, their framework can reproduce known optimal designs and also be applied to problems out of reach of current theory. Subsequent work has also adopted neural networks for the design of optimal auctions in settings with budget-constrained bidders [Feng et al., ], for the design of auctions in settings with payment redistribution [Tacchetti et al.,

], for single-bidder settings [Shen et al., ], as well as for problems of social choice [Golowich et al., ]. The use of machine learning for the design of auction mechanisms was earlier pioneered by Dütting et al. [ ], who studied the design of payment rules for a given allocation rule. Another line of work explores the sample complexity of the problem of learning an optimal auction, typically focusing on simpler settings [Cole and Roughgarden, , Morgenstern and Roughgarden, , Balcan et al., , Gonczarowski and Weinberg,
]. Earlier work studied the use of machine learning for the design of voting rules [Procaccia et al., ] and for matching and assignment problems [Narasimhan et al., , Narasimhan and Parkes, ].
In the aforementioned settings, the agents do not learn how to behave. Rather, the economic policies (typically auctions) are designed such that truthful behavior is optimal for an agent. This avoids the need for two-level learning, where agent behaviors are learned at the same time as an economic policy is learned. An earlier literature did study the co-evolution of agent behaviors and economic designs, but without making use of reinforcement learning and without studying tax polices [Byde, , Phelps et al., , ]. Stackelberg equilibria have also been widely studied in other kinds of sequential environments, especially security games. These are two-level problems where the policy of the first-mover (the defender) induces an environment for the second-mover (the attacker) [Pita et al., , Tambe, ]. Recent work has adopted MARL for the study of security games [Wang et al., , Shah et al., ]. Two-stage problems also arise in multi-agent problems where the behavior of some agents is optimized in order to improve the overall system behavior [Dimitrakakis et al., , Carroll et al., , Tylkin et al., ]. Other work has made use of reinforcement learning to study resource allocation games such as Blotto [Balduzzi et al., ].
Closest in spirit to the present paper, but used for the design of allocation mechanisms rather than for tax policy (for example matching sellers to buyer queries at Taobao and for internet advertising at Baidu), is the work of Tang [ ] and Shen et al. [ ], who make use of RL to improve market design while also allowing for agent behavior to respond to new rules. Thompson et al. [ ] have also advanced the idea of the "Positronic Economist" (see also Vorobeychik et al. [ ] and Bünz et al. [ ]), which, borrowing from Asimov's positronic brain, describes a system that can be used to represent and then automatically analyze the equilibria that correspond to the rules of economic mechanisms. Parkes and Wellman [ ] have written, generally, about the role of economic design in economies in which transactions are increasingly mediated through AI systems.

Economic Simulations: Learning in Gather-and-Build Games

We describe the core mechanics of the simulated environment, including the objective that AI agents are trained to optimize, and we describe the emergent behavior that is typical of economic AI agents in this setting. For

ease of exposition, we focus this section on experiments with no taxes applied ("free-market") in order to illustrate the kinds of social outcomes that taxes may help to correct and some of the challenges faced when designing an optimal taxation scheme.

Formally, we build on the framework of partial-observable multi-agent Markov Games (MGs) [Sutton and Barto, b], defined by the tuple (S, A, r, T, , o, I), where S and A are the state and action spaces, respectively, and I are agent indices. Bold-faced quantities denote vectors, e.g., a = (a1, . . . , aN ), the action profile for N agents. MGs proceed in episodes that last H + 1 steps (possibly infinite), covering H transitions. At each time t  [0, H], the world state is denoted st. Each agent i = 1, . . . , N receives an observation oi,t, executes an action ai,t and receives a reward ri,t. The environment transitions to the next state st+1, according to the transition distribution T(st+1|st, at). Agent-specific observations oi,t describe the portion of the state st that agent i is able to observe.
Each agent learns a policy i ai,t |oi,t, hi,t; i that maximizes its -discounted expected return, where the policy is conditioned on the history of past observations by maintaining a hidden state hi,t, and where i parameterizes the policy of agent i. Let  = (1, . . . , N ) denote the joint policy and -i = (1, . . . , i-1, i+1, . . . , N ) denote the policy without agent i. Through reinforcement learning, agent i seeks a policy to solve

Equation describes an agent i that maximizes its expected reward, which depends on the behavioral policies -i of the other agents and the environment transition dynamics T. This is a policy that best responds to the policies of other agents, given the dynamics of the simulated environment and an agent's observations.

Figure : The Gather-and-Build game. Agents move around, collect resources (wood and stone) and build houses. Agents cannot move through each others' houses, or move through water. Agents can trade resources.
For data efficiency, all agents share the same parameters during training, denoted , but condition their policy i (ai|oi, hi; ) on agent-specific observations oi and hidden-state hi. In effect, if one agent learns a useful new behavior for some part of the state space then this becomes available to another agent. At the same time, agent behaviors remain heterogeneous because they have different observations and hidden states.
. Environment Rules and Dynamics
Overview. We introduce the Gather-and-Build game, a two-dimensional grid-world in which agents can move to collect resources, earn coins by using the resources of stone and wood to build houses, and trade with other agents to exchange resources for coins. Stone and wood stochastically spawn on special resource regeneration tiles. Agents can move around the environment to gather these resources from populated resource tiles that remain empty after harvesting until some new resources spawn.
Agents can choose to use one unit of wood and one unit of stone to construct a house, and this places a house tile at the agent's current location and earns the agent some number of coins. The number of coins earned per house depends on the skill of an agent, and skill is different across agents. In addition, agents start at different initial locations in the world. These heterogeneities are the main driver of both economic inequality and specialization in our environment.
Agents can also trade resources, by submitting the number of coins they are willing to accept (an ask) or are willing to pay (a bid), respectively, to an open market, for each of wood and stone. We provide a detailed description of the environment and its underlying dynamics in the appendix (Section A).
Labor and Skill. Over the course of an episode (a single play out of the environment), agents accumulate labor cost, which reflects the amount of effort associated with the actions taken by the agent. Each type of action (moving, gathering, trading, and building) is associated with a specific labor cost. Each time an agent performs one of these actions, its accumulated labor is incremented by the action's associated labor cost. As described below (Section . ), agent rewards depend positively on accumulated coin and negatively on accumulated labor. The labor costs associated with each action type are calibrated so that agents need to be strategic in how they choose to earn income, and all agents experience the same labor costs.

Following taxation theory, we allow agents in the environment to vary by skill, which describes how much income an agent is able to earn per unit of labor. We capture this by providing, separately for each agent, ( ) a multiplier on the default number of coins earned from building a house, and ( ) the probability of gaining bonus resources when harvesting. The coin payoff for a house depends linearly on skill. An agent receives a minimum of coin per house built.
A building skill of (the minimum value) means the agent earns this minimum payoff and a building skill of . means the agent receives coin per house. The maximum skill value is . An agent's collection skill is equal to the average number of resources it receives each time it steps on a populated stone or wood resource tile. As an example, for an agent with a collection skill of . , it will always receive at least resource from stepping on a populated tile and there is a % chance it will also receive a bonus unit of the collected resource. The minimum collection skill is and the maximum is , ranging from never receiving bonus resource units to always receiving them.
We conceptualize the coins that are generated when building a house as coming from a part of the wider economy that our simulation does not directly model. An agent's building skill-- the coin the agent receives from building --reflects the value that this external market places on a particular agent's houses. The total quantity of coins generated by the simulated agents during an episode reflects the value created by their collective labor.

Environment Scenario. All experiments were carried out using the specific world map shown in Figure , which has four quadrants, mostly separated by water from each other (this blocks movement), and with spatially clustered resources. We focus on games with four agents, and apply a fixed set of building skills, chosen as the means of the quartiles of a clipped Pareto distribution with exponent a = 4 and scale m = 1. Skills and starting locations are randomly assigned to agents. These building skills correspond to payoffs of
. , . , . , and . coins per house. In all experiments, we used episodes of length H = 1000 time steps.

. Using Machine Learning to Optimize Agent Behavior

To ground our simulation in economic theory, we model the reward that the agents learn to optimize as a
utility function. Recall that xi,t denotes the endowment of resources (stone and wood) and coin owned by an
agent at time t. At time t, the utility experienced by an agent i is a function of the number of coins that it has accumulated xic,t, and the total labor that it has exerted li,t. In particular, we adopt a utility function that is concave and increasing in money, and linearly decreasing in labor:

ui(xi,t, li,t) = crra xic,t - li,t,

crra (z)

=

z1- - 1, 1-

 > 0.

()

Here, li,t is the cumulative labor associated with the actions taken by the agent up to time t, and the concave isoelastic utility crra models diminishing marginal utility over money [Debreu, ]. Parameter  controls the degree of nonlinearity: higher  represents larger deviations from linear behavior. We assume that all agents share the same form of utility function. This utility function is visualized in Figure for a simple setting without trading and where there is no labor cost associated with moving or gathering resources.
Rational economic agents optimize their total discounted utility over time, with

Figure : Agent utility, as defined in Equation , in a simplified setting where utility only depends on the number of houses built, for four agents with different skills n0 < . . . < n3. For clarity of this visualization, each agent is assumed to receive a fixed income per house, which increases with skill, as described in Section . . For each house built, each agent is also assumed to have exerted a fixed amount of labor. Hence, in this simple example, agent utility only depends on the number of houses built. Each agent experiences a law of diminishing returns (marginal utility decreases as income grows). As agent skill increases, the point of maximal utility is reached at a higher number of houses built.

In the paradigm of RL, this is achieved by defining the instantaneous reward ri,t for agent i as the change in utility of agent i at time t.
Equation describes a multi-agent optimization problem, when the agents are simultaneously optimizing their behavior, since the utility for agent i depends on the behaviors of other agents (for example, their gathering, building and trading actions). For instance, another agent might block an agent's access to resources, which would impact how many houses the agent can build in the future and hence its future utility.
In general, such optimization problems are described as partially-observable multi-agent Markov games, and optimal solutions correspond to refinements of Nash equilibria. A set of policies form a Nash equilibrium as long as no agent wants to unilaterally deviate from its own policy. Refinements such as subgame-perfect equilibria also require rational, off-equilibrium behavior. Although computing equilibria for complex environments such as this remains out-of-reach, we will see that RL can nevertheless be used to achieve sensible, emergent behaviors (and behaviors that also drive good tax policy, when coupled with the use of the AI Economist).

Deep RL agents. We make use of a deep neural network to model agent policies,

ai,t   (owi,torld, oai,gtent, omi,tarket, oti,atx, hi,t-1; ).

()

The output of this policy network includes a probability distribution over actions, with ai,t sampled from this distribution. Not represented in the notation, the policy network also generates an updated hidden state hi,t. The inputs to the network include the agent-specific hidden state and agent-specific observations, which are decomposed as follows:

Figure : Schematic overview of the general network architecture used in our work. Spatial observations are processed by a stack of two convolutional layers (CNN) and flattened into a fixed-length feature vector. This feature vector is concatenated with the remaining observation inputs and the result is processed by a stack of two fully connected layers (MLP). The output is then used to update the hidden state of an LSTM and action logits are computed via a linear projection of the updated hidden state. Finally, the network computes a softmax probability layer for each action head. For the agent policy, there is a single action space and action head. For the tax policy, there is a separate action space and action head for each tax rate the tax policy controls (described below).

Section A of the appendix provides exact details of the information available in the agents' observations. The learned hidden state hi,t is used to encode the history of past observations. Figure depicts the general network architecture used here.
Emergent Behavior of AI Agents. Figure provides a breakdown of an example rollout of play by AI agents across a single episode, once training has proceeded for a large number of episodes. Each agent
We include tax information even for the free-market, when all tax rates are zero. This ensures that the structure of the observations is the same for all taxation schemes.

has a unique color. Agents are ordered from low to high skill as dark-blue, light-blue, yellow, and orange, corresponding to payoffs of . , . , . , and . coins per house, respectively.
This rollout reveals an interesting specialization of effort. The dark- and light-blue agents focus entirely on collecting wood and stone (respectively), the orange agent focuses almost entirely on building houses, and the yellow agent builds several houses early on before switching to collecting and selling.
This pattern of behavior and division of labor is typical of agents trained in this simulated environment, and stems from the different incomes each agent can earn per house it builds, as well as the agents' initial locations in the world. In particular, the low skilled dark- and light-blue agents learn to shift their strategies entirely away from building houses. These agents earn their income by selling resources to the higher skilled agents, who choose to earn income through building (Figure , middle). The yellow agent earns enough income from building to do so early on, making use of the nearby resources, but then switches strategies.
This specialization is a consequence of agents learning to maximize their own individual objectives. We do not impose these roles or behaviors directly. Rather, this specialization arises as a result of differently skilled workers learning to balance their income and effort. This emergent behavior helps to validate the framework as an economic simulation, by reproducing a standard feature of real world economies, that of specialization. Standard economic intuition states that agents should specialize in whichever means of production allows them to most efficiently convert their labor to income, and this is consistent with the behaviors that the AI agents discover.
Even with specialization, the agents' incomes can vary considerably. While a free-market economy maximizes productivity, it provides no guarantee on income equality. This is evident in the highly unequal incomes experienced by the AI agents.
Machine Learning for Optimal Tax Policies
We now introduce a social planner who uses economic policy to improve social outcomes, in particular taxation together with redistribution. The challenge is that taxation can reduce productivity. Workers may choose to forgo labor as a result of paying tax on income, and thus gaining less utility for labor effort. This may have a particularly strong effect on the higher skilled and thus more productive workers. Thus, there is a trade-off between equality and productivity: the same interventions that allow wealth to be redistributed also result in there being less wealth to redistribute in the first place. As a result of this coupling between taxation and labor, determining an optimal tax policy poses a difficult, constrained optimization problem.
A conceptual view of the trade-off between productivity and equality for different tax policies is illustrated in Figure . The spectrum of tax policies has two extremes: the free market, which only considers productivity and does not raise any taxes; and pure redistribution, which divides all incomes equally amongst all workers and thus achieves equality but at the potential cost of a large drop in productivity. Here, the notion of optimality implies that a tax policy realizes a trade-off between equality and productivity along the Pareto boundary linking these two extremes. The optimal tax literature has proposed several solutions, including the tax formula proposed by Saez [ ] (shown here, together with the AI Economist, with purely illustrative tradeoffs). But the results from optimal tax policy are limited to simple economic models, and require various simplifying assumptions, for example about the effect of higher taxes on labor choices.
The remainder of this section describes our approach for studying optimal taxation. We describe the kind of tax policy learned by the AI Economist, define the types of social objectives that can be adopted, and describe how we use reinforcement learning to jointly optimize agent behavior as well as the tax policy used in the economy.

Agents with lower building skill choose to earn income through gathering resources and selling them to the highly skilled agents.
. Periodic Taxes with Bracketed Schedules
Income Taxes. There are many possible choices for tax policies. In this work, we focus on periodic income taxes with lump-sum redistribution. Each tax period lasts M steps (we use M = H/10, so that there are ten tax periods per episode). The taxes in period p, beginning at time step t and ending at time step t + M, are applied to the income zip earned by an agent i within that tax period.
At the start of each tax period, the planner chooses a tax schedule T(z) that specifies the amount of taxes an agent will owe as a function of the income it earns during the period. At the end of each tax period the total tax revenue is evenly redistributed back to the agents, so that the adjusted, post-tax income to agent i in

At the end of an episode, each agent's coin endowment is the sum of its post-tax incomes in each period: xic,H = p z~ip.

Bracketed Tax Schedules. To allow comparison across different schemes, we adopt income brackets for
describing a tax schedule, imitating the US federal taxation scheme. A bracketed schedule defines a set of cut-off income levels mb, where b = 0, . . . B, for B income brackets. The edges of bracket b are [mb, mb+1], and, by definition, m0 = 0 and mB = . The social planner sets the tax schedule T(z) by choosing the marginal tax rate   [0, 1]B to be applied within each bracket.
Given this, the total tax payment T(z) for an agent earning z in a tax period is determined by taking the sum of the amount of income within each bracket [mb, mb+1] times that bracket's marginal rate b:

B-1

T(z) = b · ((mb+1 - mb) 1[z > mb+1] + (z - mb) 1[mb < z  mb+1]) ,

()

b=0

where 1[z > mb+1]  {0, 1} is an indicator function for whether z saturates bracket b and 1[mb < z  mb+1]  {0, 1} is an indicator function for whether z falls within bracket b.

. Optimal Taxation
Social Welfare Functions. The objective of optimal tax theory is described through a social welfare function swf. Social welfare can be expressed in many ways. One approach considers the trade-off between income equality and productivity. For this, the equality in an economy at some point in time can be defined as the complement of the normalized Gini index on the distribution on wealth, this wealth defined as the cumulative number of coins owned by an agent after taxation and redistribution.

For an agent population with monetary endowments xc = (x1c, . . . , xNc ), we define equality eq(xc) as:

eq(xc)

=

1

-

gini(xc)

N N-

, 1

0  eq(xc)  1,

()

where the Gini index is defined as,

gini(xc) =

N i=1

N j=1

| xic

-

xcj |,

2N

N i=1

xic

0  gini(xc)  N - 1 . N

()

Given this, eq = 1 implies perfect equality (all endowments of money are identical), while eq = 0 means perfect inequality (one agent owns all money). The productivity in an economy at some point in time is defined as the sum of all wealth over all agents:

N

prod(xc) = xic.

()

i=1

We write eqt(xtc) and prodt(xtc) to denote the equality and productivity, respectively, based on the cumulative endowment xtc up to time t.
The primary social welfare function that we consider in this work optimizes a trade-off between equality
and productivity, defined as the product of equality and productivity:

swft(xtc) = eqt(xtc) · prodt(xtc).

()

Another family of social welfare functions, and one that receives attention in the optimal taxation theory, is the family of linear-weighted sums of agent utilities, defined for weights i  0:

N

swft(xtc, lt) = i · ui xic,t, li,t .

()

i=1

Some illustrative choices for the weights adopted in this social welfare function include:

· Utilitarian: i = 1, indicating no preference for any agent
· Rawlsian: i = 1[xic,t = minjJ xcj,t], which focuses on the poorest agents
· Inverse income-weighted: i = 1/xic,t, which preferences the agents with lower endowments over those with higher endowments.

In this work, we will mainly make use of the product of equality and productivity as the social welfare function, and it is this that the AI Economist is configured to optimize for. But many other choices are possible. A key benefit of our framework is that it is compatible with any social welfare function.
For the purposes of comparing the performance of the AI Economist and other tax frameworks, we also adopt a variation on the second family of social welfare functions, where we adopt inverse income-weighted weights and consider agents' cumulative endowment at the end of an episode.

Figure : Two-level RL. In the inner loop, RL agents gain experience by performing labor, receiving income, and paying taxes, and learn through balancing exploration and exploitation how to adapt their behavior to maximize their utility. In the outer loop, the social planner adapts tax policies to optimize its social objective.

The Planner's Problem. The planner can observe agent endowments, xi,t, as well as the global state of the world, including agent positions, available resources, and market states. The planner cannot directly observe agent skills or other endogenous values such as labor or utility functions. The planner does not personalize taxes, but adopts a single tax schedule for all agents.
Similar to the agent policies, the planner can make use of the entire history of observations, via a learned hidden state, to implement its tax policy. Based on the information available, it adopts a tax policy p to set tax rates  in any given tax period. The planner's objective is to optimize social welfare,

= rp,t







where swft is used to denote the social welfare at time t, based on cumulative endowment and labor up until that time, and the planner's instantaneous reward rp,t is the change in social welfare at time t. Without discounting, this objective reduces to the total social welfare at the end of an episode.
This planning problem includes the effect of agents' behavior, encoded through agent policies , and this behavior of agents depends on the tax policy. As such, equation encodes a difficult optimization problem; because taxes affect agents' income and thus utilities, the planner is effectively changing the agents' MDP.

. Inner-Outer-Loop Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning provides a suitable learning framework for adapting behaviors in a sequential environment, and is used here to allow both the economic agents and the social planner to learn from experience collected through trial-and-error strategies. We conceptualize the RL framework used in this paper as including two levels of learning, namely an `inner' loop and an `outer' loop, as depicted in Figure .
The problem has the flavor of a Stackelberg game in which the planner is a first-mover (Stackelberg leader), announcing a tax schedule, and where the agents responding to this tax schedule (Stackelberg followers).

In short, the key benefits of our RL framework are:
· the social planner can optimize taxes for any social objective swf, and
· given a choice of social welfare functions swf, the social planner does not need prior world knowledge, prior economic knowledge, or assumptions on the behavior of economic agents.
The main challenge posed by this two-level RL problem comes from the fact that each level effectively determines the MDP faced by the other level. As the planner learns and changes taxes, the agents' utility and reward landscapes change. In turn, as agents learn and adapt to new taxes, their behavior changes the expected social welfare generated through the tax schedule. In this way, simultaneous learning creates an unstable reward landscape for both the agents and the planner.

Inner Loop. In the inner loop, RL agents gain experience by performing labor, receiving income, and paying taxes, and learn through trial-and-error how to adapt their behavior to maximize their utility. Given a fixed tax policy, this is a standard RL problem in which agents iteratively explore and discover which behaviors are optimal for their fixed utility function, while observing the active tax schedule.
However, because the tax policy is changing, and in turn the behavior of others, the agent is faced with a non-stationary MDP. Specifically, the utility of agent i depends on its post-tax incomes xi (Eq ). The non-stationarity faced by agents can be understood by considering their learning objective in the context of a changing tax policy (generalizing Eq ):

T

t
t=1

ui(xi,t, li,t) - ui(xi,t-1, li,t-1)

+ ui(xi,0, li,0)

.

()

The agent's expected future utility is conditional on both the current state and the current tax schedule. Hence, as the planner's policy p changes, the taxes that an agent experiences will change, and agents face a non-stationary learning environment in which they constantly need to adapt to a changing utility landscape. As time goes on, because the post-tax income for the same type and amount of labor can change over time, agent decisions that were optimal in the past might not be optimal in the present.

Outer Loop. In the outer loop, the social planner adapts its tax policy to optimize the social objective, following the learning objective defined in Eq . Since the agents also change their behavior, the planner also faces a non-stationary problem, due to the dependence of Eq on the policy of each agent.
In order to allow both the agents and the planner to learn an optimal behavior, which considers the best response of agents to the tax policy, the agents and the planner must be trained jointly. That is, there is little point to training a planner using a set of fixed agent policies, since the social welfare achieved would not be meaningful without considering the way agents' behaviors would change in response.
It should also be pointed out that our terminology is not meant to imply any nested training structure. When learning a tax policy, we train the agent policies and planner policies jointly, following standard practice for multi-agent RL. Here, joint training entails both agents and the planner updating their weights simultaneously during each training episode. Algorithm in the Appendix provides a more detailed description of the training framework.

Improved Social Outcomes with AI Agents

. Baseline Methods

We now show empirically that the AI Economist can outperform baseline tax policies. In particular, we will compare the following tax models:

· free-market (no taxes),

· US federal single-filer tax schedule,

· Saez tax formula (adapted for a multi-period setting), and

· the AI Economist planner.

The specific tax rates set by these models are depicted in Figure . See the related work (Section . ) for a broader discussion on the various tax frameworks proposed in the optimal tax literature, including linear tax models and analytical approaches to dynamic taxation in sequential economies.
All tax models set tax rates for a bracketed tax schedule, and use the same income brackets, following the US federal income tax schedule and scaling so that USD corresponds to Coin:

m = [0, 9700, 39475, 84200, 160725, 204100, 510300, ] (USD)

US Federal Income Tax Rates (Single-filer, ). The bracket tax rates are given by:

 = [0.1, 0.12, 0.22, 0.24, 0.32, 0.35, 0.37].

()

Saez Tax Formula (single-period). A prominent analytical treatment of optimal taxation is given by Saez [ ], who proposes a closed-form solution for optimal tax rates in a single-period economy.
Let and F denote the probability density and cumulative density function on income, respectively. The Saez framework assumes the planner can observe the population's distribution over incomes z  (z). Here, z and the associated density functions refer to pre-tax income within a single tax period.
Saez [ ] works with the linear-weighted family of social welfare functions (Eq ), and defines the social marginal welfare weights as

gi

=

dswf dui dui dxic

=

i

dui dxic

.

()

Weight gi represents the change in social welfare due to a change in agent i's endowment. The weights i, and implied social marginal welfare weights, gi, parameterize the planner's objective, and encode a social choice, for example emphasizing agents with low wealth over agents with high wealth. In instantiating Saez's framework, one available choice is to treat these social marginal welfare weights as the primitives in the model. We do this, and set the social marginal welfare weights for the purpose of applying Saez's framework to be

We have also conducted experiments with linear planner models T(s) = , snonspatial , but found they significantly underperform compared to all non-trivial tax models mentioned above. Furthermore, we found that pure income redistribution leads to close-to-perfect equality, but very low productivity levels, and as a result, significantly worse social metrics. As such, we do not include results for these models.
In the optimal tax theory literature the derivative of utility is taken with regard to an agent's consumption, which reflects its available money after taxes and redistribution. Endowment plays the same role as consumption in our model.

iI gi = 1 (see also Section . ). This framework does not explicitly

optimize for the product of equality and productivity. However, we find empirically that optimizing with this

choice for the social marginal welfare weights tends to improve the product of equality and productivity.

To define the Saez framework, let (z) denote the marginal average income at income z, normalized by the

fraction of incomes above z, i.e.,

(z)

z· 1-

Let G(z) denote the normalized, reverse cumulative Pareto weight over incomes above a threshold z, i.e.,

G(z) =

 p(z )g(z )dz .

()

P(z  z) z =z

where g(z) is the normalized social marginal welfare weight of an agent earning income z. In this way, G(z) represents how much the social welfare function weights the income above threshold z. Let elasticity e(z) denote the average sensitivity of an agent's income to changes in the tax rate, defined as

e(z)

Saez [ ] shows that the optimal marginal tax-rate at pre-tax income z is

(z)

=

-

1- G(z)

G(z) + (z)e(z)

.

()

The salient property of this formula is that it does not depend on the agent's utility function, but rather depends on the population's income distribution, (z), this defining (z) and G(z), and the tax elasticity of income, e(z). Both of these quantities are, at least in principle, measurable. In practice, a challenge in applying the Saez formula is in estimating the tax elasticity of income, which is highly non-trivial in realworld economies. See Gruber and Saez [ ] for an extensive review of empirical approaches for the Saez framework.
The resulting tax schedule depends sharply on the shape of the income distribution. A log-normal-like income distribution, for example, leads to regressive taxes, with lower marginal rates at higher incomes, while a Pareto-like distribution leads to progressive taxes, with higher marginal rates at higher incomes (see Mankiw et al. [ ]).

Saez Tax Formula (multi-period). In our experiments, we apply the Saez formula to the multi-period
setting by estimating the tax elasticity of income at the start of each tax period, and then appealing to Eq . For this, we make use of a buffer D = zi, i , which is a set of pairs of observed incomes and tax rates in a window of previous tax periods, where the index  refers to a datapoint coming from agent i.
Following Gruber and Saez [ ], we assume constant tax elasticity e~, with

zt = z0 · (1 - t)e~.

()

Hence, we can write:

log(zt) = e~ · log(1 - t) + log(z0),

()

where z0 is the income that would result from zero taxes. Given the buffer D collected from multiple rollouts, we estimate e~ using ordinary least-squares regression on Eq . In particular, we make use of the , most recent incomes and tax rates observed during rollout episodes, and find that this leads to stable estimates for the average elasticity e~.

AI Economist. For the AI Economist, we make use of a deep neural network to set the marginal tax rate in each bracket, denoted

  p(owp,torld, oapg,tent, omp,tarket, otpa,tx, hp,t-1; ).

()

This shares the same general organization as the agents' policy model (Section . ). Indeed, the planner and agent policy networks use the same basic network architecture (Figure ). However, the information in the planner observations differs from that in agents in some important ways. For instance, the planner observes the full spatial state of the world in owp,torld, and the planner observes all agents' public states in oapg,tent but does not observe any of their private states, observing endowments but not skills. Section A of the Appendix offers a detailed explanation of the different observations available to the agents and the planner.

. Training Strategy: Two-phase Training and Tax Curricula

As discussed in Section . , the joint optimization problem posed by the inner-outer RL approach can lead to instability during learning. One source of instability is that high tax rates cause large income penalties during training, even for actions that might be optimal under low tax rates. Effective agent behaviors can be hard to learn due to this kind of noisy feedback from an unconstrained, suboptimal planner that generates random tax rates. We have found this to be especially problematic in the initial phases of learning.
To stabilize learning we use a two-phase training approach. In the first phase, we train a collection of agent models for a set of random seeds and without any taxes applied (the free-market scenario). This results in a set of agent models (one for each random seed) that are well adapted to the general game dynamics.
In phase two, we resume training, but with one of the studied tax models active. In the case of the AI Economist, we also allow the planner to continue to adapt, along with continued agent learning. To avoid unstable learning dynamics created by the sudden introduction of taxes, we impose an annealing schedule over the early portion of phase two, during which a maximum limit on the allowable, marginal tax rates is linearly annealed from % to %.
Furthermore, we find that entropy regularization of the planner policy is necessary to achieve good outcomes in the face of these complex, joint learning dynamics. Entropy regularization adds the policy's entropy as an additional, weighted term in the policy gradient objective, and is defined as

entropy() = -Ea(.|s) [log (a|s)] .

()

The use of this entropy term promotes policies that explore more when used together with on-policy learning, which samples trajectories according to the current policy  [Williams and Peng, , Mnih et al.,
]. We perform experiments using the RLlib framework [Liang et al., ]. We use proximal policy gradients [Schulman et al., ] and the Adam optimizer [Kingma and Ba, ] to compute policy gradients. Samples were collected from environment replicas in parallel, using a sampling horizon of timesteps between policy update iterations (a full episode consists of timesteps). Trajectories were chunked into subsequences of length for training the recurrent networks. For more details, see the Appendix. All experiments performed phase two training with million samples, which we found to be sufficient for both agent and planner models to converge to stable policies. The annealing schedule allows the maximum marginal tax rate to reach % by million samples.

. Equality, Productivity, and Social Welfare Metrics
We compare economic outcomes under the AI Economist with the free market (no taxation or redistribution), a simulated US Federal tax schedule, and the tax policy that results from the Saez framework [Saez, ].

But this does not include the effect of subsidies that arise from this collection of taxes (in effect, lower incomes receive net subsidies, see Figure ).

model. The AI Economist also improves equality by % compared to the free-market, at only an % decrease in productivity.
As discussed in Section , the challenge in setting taxes stems from the inherent trade-off between equality and productivity. This can be seen in the empirical results, where redistribution improves equality but at the cost of productivity. This property naturally emerges in our simulations, by allowing agents to learn optimal responses to taxes.
In summary, these results demonstrate ( ) that our framework allows us to reproduce the central challenge considered in optimal taxation theory, the trade-off between equality and productivity, ( ) that the severity of this trade-off depends on the choice of tax schedule, and ( ) that RL can be used to optimize tax policies.

. Tax Schedules and Wealth Redistribution after Taxes and Subsidies
Comparing Tax Schedules. All tax models control the marginal tax rates applied to each of seven income brackets (see Figure , which illustrates the average bracket rate set by each model). We set up the economic simulation such that the fraction of agent incomes per income bracket are in rough alignment with those in the US economy .
The US Federal tax rates are progressive, with a marginal tax rate that increases with higher income. For the present setting, and with the social welfare objective that we adopt, the Saez tax framework mostly sets a regressive tax schedule, with a marginal tax rate that decreases with higher income. The AI Economist features a more idiosyncratic structure, with a blend of progressive and regressive tax schedules. In particular, it sets a higher top tax rate (on income above ), a lower tax rate for incomes between and , and both higher and lower tax rates on incomes below .
Effective Tax After Redistribution. The AI Economist's tax schedule provides higher subsidies to low income agents than the baselines. The agents have different skill levels, and the learned behaviors, incomes, and amount of tax paid all depend heavily on skill. Figure presents the agent-by-agent averages after sorting
We also find in our experiments that total redistribution (such that all workers have the same income after redistribution) yields perfectly equal but highly unproductive economies and very low equality-vs-productivity trade-offs.
Based on preliminary experiments with the US Federal tax policy.

Figure : Agent-by-agent averages after sorting by skill. Income before redistribution (top-left) shows the average pre-tax income earned by each kind of agent. The amount of tax paid before distribution is shown in the bottom left. The amount of tax paid after redistribution is shown in the bottom right (the lower skill agents receive a net subsidy). The income after redistribution (top-right) shows the net average coin per agent at the end of the episode (the lower-skilled agents have higher net income under the AI Economist's tax scheme).
by skill. Income before redistribution (top-left) shows the average pre-tax income earned by each kind of agent. Tax paid is shown in the bottom left. The effect of redistribution, which equally divides collected taxes among the agents, is that the lower-skilled agents receive a net subsidy (bottom right). The income after redistribution shows the net average coin per agent at the end of the episode (top right). The lower-skilled agents have higher net income under the AI Economist than under the other models.
The Impact of Tax on Economic Activity. To form a better understanding of how taxes set by the AI Economist improve over those set by the Saez formula, which provides the strongest baseline, we compare their respective impacts on the agents' economic activity (Figure ). In both cases, the low-income agents choose to specialize as "gatherer-and-seller" agents. Interestingly, these agents collect fewer resources under the Saez policy, and the high-skilled "buyer-and-builder" agent compensates by increasing its own resource collection (Left panel). This de-specialization contributes to the decreased income generated through building under the Saez taxes (Middle panel), with this decrease accounting for weaker productivity.
Because the Saez formula leads to a more regressive tax structure than the AI Economist, the latter yields higher equality through mechanical effects (i.e. stronger redistribution). Interestingly, the AI Economist also improves equality through behavioral effects. Under the Saez scheme, the "buyer-and-builder" collects more resources directly from the environment, meaning it makes fewer purchases from the other agents. Trading

serves to redistribute the income achieved from building houses to the "gatherer-and-seller" agents, but, owing to the behavioral differences, this redistributive effect is stronger under the AI Economist (Right panel). From this perspective, the tax scheme discovered by the AI Economist appears better adapted to the complex economic interactions that shape both equality and productivity.
. Tax-Gaming Strategies
Figure provides an example of the income and taxes collected during an episode of the AI Economist environment, shown here after the tax policy has converged. Recall that each episode is divided into ten tax periods of equal length. At the start of each period, a new tax schedule is set by the AI Economist according to the new world state. Agents act in the environment, earn income, and taxes are collected at the end of the

period according to the tax schedule and redistributed. We see emergent tax gaming, where AI agents learn to lower their average effective tax by alternating
between earning high and low incomes in each period, rather than smoothing their income across tax periods. Figure (left) shows there is considerable variability in income earned from period to period, shown here for the highest skilled agent. Figure (right) shows the total amount of taxes paid given this behavior, together with the total taxes that would be paid if the income had been smoothed across periods.
We see this kind of tax avoidance behavior in our experiments for both the Saez and AI Economist models, which feature lower top tax rates (regressive schedules), making it more tax-efficient to earn high incomes. This underscores the richness of the simulation-based learning framework. Moreover, the AI Economist remains effective even in the face of this kind of strategic behavior.
Improved Social Outcomes with Human Participants
We have also explored whether AI-learned tax policies improve social outcomes in economic simulations with human participants who earn real money. To do so, we conducted experiments on the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform, with participants based in the US. We find that the AI Economist tax policy can transfer to simulations with people without extensive recalibration or fine-tuning. The AI Economist achieves equality-productivity trade-offs that are competitive with the strongest baseline, the Saez tax policy (Equation
), and achieves higher inverse income-weighted social welfare.
. Experimental Methodology
Simulation Environment for Human Participants. We used the same world layout as in the AI experiments. The world map features four quadrants, mostly separated from each other by water. Each quadrant contains only stone, wood, both resources, or neither resource. Each participant controls an agent with a fixed skill, set as the mean of the quartiles of a Pareto distribution with exponent a = 4 and scale m = 1, and each starting in one of the four corners. This starting location was randomized for each episode.
We make several modifications to account for human response times, allowing for an acceptable experiment duration and simplified controls:
· We disable trading. We experimented with several trade inferfaces, but found none that were usable enough. Even without trading, humans experienced the same economic drivers, namely utilitymaximization and diminishing returns, as the AI agents.
· The only kind of action that is associated with a labor cost is the build action. Moving around the environment and collecting resources has zero cost. To compensate for this, the cost of building a house is % higher than in the AI experiment ( vs. labor units per house).
· Each episode lasts five minutes. To allow for acceptable human response times we set the frame rate to ten frames per second (each frame corresponds to a new world state). This provides participants with enough time to achieve reasonable performance, partially correcting for the lower response times compared with AIs.
· Each episode lasts timesteps rather than timesteps, with each tax period consisting of 300 timesteps (keeping ten tax periods in each episode).

Graphical User Interface. We developed a web-based interface to let people operate in an economic simulation similar to the one used in the AI experiments. For a full visualization of the experimental flow and pages, see Appendix C. The interface (Figure ) displays agents' endowments (coin, stone, wood, houses), the remaining episode time, the last change in coin endowment, the bonus in USD, the tax schedule, the current active tax rate (which depends on the income in the current tax period), and the remaining time in the current tax period.
We also provide participants with the number of profitable houses left to build (i.e., for how many more houses in the current tax period will it still remain profitable to build). This decision aid helped participants to better understand the economic environment, leading to less variance in the experimental results across trials. Despite this guidance, participants frequently scored lower utility than in the AI experiments. Sometimes this would come about because of adversarial behavior of others, especially resulting from people blocking other people from accessing areas with resources, or finding ways to trap people in corners.

Zero-shot Transfer of Tax Models. The tax models were transfered from the AI-only setting. The US Federal tax rates were unchanged. For the Saez model, we used the average tax rate observed during an episode once training has converged. For the AI Economist, we identified an effective AI-driven tax schedule from the AI experiments conducted with low planner policy entropy regularization. The particular tax schedule that we use has a "Camelback" style shape, and is depicted in Figure . The effective taxes after redistribution are shown in Figure . The "Camelback" policy achieves competitive equality-productivity and weighted social welfare (Equation ) in the AI-only simulations, compared to the Saez tax model.
The productivity was lower in experiments with people. This is due to suboptimal human behavior, as well as lower human response times compared to AI agents. To ensure that all tax policies could still make use of the full range of tax brackets, we calibrated the income bracket cutoffs to approximately match the income bracket occupancy rates to those in the AI experiments, achieving this by scaling the income cutoffs down by a factor of three.

The Experimental Protocol. We ran all experiments with US-based participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants performed HITs (Human Intelligence Task). Each HIT consists of a sequence of four episodes, with a tutorial before each episode, and a post-episode survey. For detailed descriptions and visualizations of the experiment modules, see the appendix.
HITs were announced in batches of - , where each unique participant could accept one assignment from each batch (but could perform more than one HIT across different batches). Batches were sized so that all assignments in the batch were completed within two hours, accounting for participant availability. Participants were instructed not to communicate with each other. Experiments were conducted during
am- pm and - pm, Pacific Time. All participants were grouped into groups of four. Each group went through a sequence of four episodes, with each episode corresponding to a different tax policy (free market, US federal, Saez, and AI), these applied in random order to control for learning effects.

Payment. Each participant received $ base pay and a variable bonus of at most $ for each HIT. The bonus was proportional to the utility achieved by the participant, reflecting the post-tax income and the labor cost at the end of each episode. The US dollar (USD) bonus was computed as

USD bonus = Utility × 0.06,

()

This model was chosen from a set of AI models that performed as well as or better than the baselines tax models. In particular, we found that planner policies with high entropy did not generalize as well in the zero-shot transfer setting. We did not retrain or fine tune the AI tax model.

where utility was measured in units of Coins achieved by the participant in the episode. The effect is an average payment per HIT of $ . . Since the average duration of a HIT was approximately minutes, the effective income (approximately $ /hour) is substantially above the US federal minimum wage ($ . /hour). As such, we believe that the stakes should be high enough to encourage participants to try to maximize their bonus and avoid behaviors that result in a decrease in utility.
We use a set of qualification HITs to build a pool of around qualified participants who are familiar with the instructions and the simulation environment. Qualification HITs used exactly the same rules and environment as in the main task, with the only exception being that no information about taxes was given. For instance, in the qualification, participants did not observe what the tax schedule was, nor an explanation in the tutorial as to how taxes were applied. In the main task, participants completed a tutorial that explained that taxes affected the income gained per house, and how this impacted their utility (and payments for the HIT). In an exit survey, participants were asked about their strategy, why they thought they won or lost, and what was confusing about the experiment.
. Results
Experiment Data. We report results on two batches of experiments. In the first batch, groups were formed with the participants who were available at the end of an episode. This allowed as many users as possible to complete four episodes (we found during qualification batches that some participants experienced technical issues that prevented them from completing four episodes in sequence). In the second batch, each group of workers was fixed during a sequence of episodes with different tax models. The first batch consisted of episodes with participants. The second batch consisted of episodes with participants.
Feedback from participants and manual inspection of movement patterns in rollouts suggested that there were episodes in which one or more participants suffered from connectivity issues (as evidenced by extreme lag or disconnections), did not move around the world, or in which there were other factors that severely affected proper participation. As such, we dropped episodes from the analysis in which the overall productivity was less than Coin. This excluded out of episodes from the first batch and out of episodes from the second batch for our analysis.
Statistical Analysis. For the first batch, we test whether the difference in the social welfare between the tax models is statistically significant. In particular, for each participant a, we compute the mean value Zai of the social objective (e.g., eq × prod) under each tax model i. We then perform a two-sided t-test for the alternate hypothesis Ya; 0, with p = 0.05. The data consists of the differences {Ya; = Za - Za } for each pair of tax models and , for each participant a that experiences both models.
For the second batch, where group consistency was enforced, we perform this test at the group level. For each group g, we compute the mean value Zgi of the social objective (e.g., eq × prod) under each tax model i. We then use a two-sided t-test to test the alternate hypothesis Yg; 0 with p = 0.05 on the set of differences
Yg; = Zg - Zg , for each pair of tax models and .
Improved Social Outcomes. In experiments with human participants, the "Camelback" tax schedule achieves an equality-productivity trade-off that is comparable to the Saez model, and with better equalityproductivity performance than the US Federal and free-market approaches (see Figure ). We observed large variance in productivity across episodes, which can be attributed to adversarial behavior and other factors that we discuss below.
We also evaluate the social welfare at the end of an episode, using inverse post-tax endowments as social

This evaluation objective places more weight on agents with lower endowments than those with higher endowments, considering agent endowments at the end of an episode, and thus the cumulative
effect of tax policy over a sequence of ten tax periods.

This objective is related to the choice we make about the tax policy objective when instantiating the Saez framework, while deviating in a couple of important ways. First, the Saez framework considers economies with a single tax period and does not consider the effect of taxation policy on the cumulative endowment. Second, the particular choice we make in regard to the social

(statistically significant at p = 0.05).

The results of the experiment with respect to this objective are shown in Figure . We can see that the "Camelback" tax schedule significantly outperforms all baselines for this social welfare objective.
Overall, the relative performance of the AI Economist compared with the various baselines is similar for the experiments with AI agents and the experiments with human participants. In particular, even though the "Camelback" tax schedule is qualitatively different than the tax schedule that results from the Saez framework, it yields a competitive equality-productivity tradeoff in comparison with the schedule coming from the Saez model.

. Discussion

The experiments with human participants are conducted in a zero-shot learning transfer setting, and the AI Economist performs well, even though there are a number of differences between the two settings. Besides the modifications to the environments, other factors affecting the transfer from the AI environment to the human environment include:

· AI and human behavior differs substantially. For example, we have observed that humans display a higher frequency of adversarial behavior, such as blocking other people. These kinds of behaviors are socially suboptimal, but might seem optimal to people (keeping resources to oneself). This can be partially attributed to a lack of trading, but also hints at a common human intuition that blocking off regions with resources should be an effective strategy. In contrast, the AI agents learn a strategy that does not include blocking: they might profit from trading and should not waste time on building houses to block off regions.

· Learning effects. As human participants experience multiple episodes, their strategy improves, as observed, for example, through lower average productivity and worse social metrics during qualification rounds. This learning effect is partially controlled for by randomizing the order of tax models presented to participants and only using experimental episodes where participants have already participated in one or more qualification rounds.
· We set the payoff per house for each human agent using a preset skill. For real people, this is not the only factor that affects the expected average payoff. For instance, people can have different strategies in the simulation, which affects their average payoff and hence their implied skill. Hence, varying skill and payoff as a simulation setting only partially emulates the effect of skill on the expected payoff and utility that people experience.
Considering all these factors, we find these results for the AI Economist in the presence of human participants encouraging. The AI-driven tax model did not require knowledge of economic theory, did not require that we estimate the tax elasticity of labor, and was nevertheless able to learn a well-performing tax policy for use with human participants tabula rasa. We were able to apply the model without requiring recalibration of tax rates. The only calibration was to scale down the income brackets by a factor of three to adjust for the relative productivity of human and AI agents and enable all income brackets to be exercised.
We emphasize that we do not endorse the particular tax schedule determined by the AI Economist for use in the real economy.
Still, the encouraging transfer performance suggests there is potential for building AI-driven tax models that can find application to the real world, as a new tool to be used by governments. Moreover, given that the AI tax policy, which is dynamic in that its tax schedule changes across tax periods, substantially outperforms the Saez formula in the AI simulations, an interesting direction for future research is to develop experiments that can inform ways with which dynamic tax models can be applied to human settings.
Conclusion
We believe the intersection of machine learning and economics presents a wide range of exciting research directions, and gives ample opportunity for new machine learning advances that will have significant positive social impact. Our vision for the AI Economist is to enable an objective study of the impact of economic policies on real-world economies, at a level of complexity that traditional economics research cannot easily address.
For tax policies in particular, we are hopeful that this kind of research can increase equality and productivity in the real world, helping to promote more just and healthy economies. We also hope that the AI Economist can foster transparency, reproducibility, and open and facts-based discussion about applying machine learning to economic decision-making, through our public research publications and open-source code. As such, we hope that future economic AI models can robustly and transparently augment real-world economic policy-making and in doing so improve social welfare.
In this paper, the economic agents and social planner were trained using model-free RL in AI-based, economic simulations. A key benefit of using model-free RL is flexibility: for instance, any social objective can be used as the reward function for the planner. Moreover, it does not need any prior world knowledge to find a well-performing tax policy. However, this approach assumes that the inputs and outputs to the agents' and planner's policy models are sufficient and well-defined. For instance, the planner should be able to observe all state information that is relevant for determining the optimal tax policy. Our initial experiments with human participants suggest that, in our problem setting, the state observed by the planner was sufficient to generalize well to human agents. In future work, it would be interesting to explore which state information of the real

world should be captured by economic simulators to enable generalization of policies from simulation to the real world.
This work is suggestive of the promise of AI-based, economic simulators for learning economic policies with the potential to transfer well to the real world. We demonstrated that economic simulators can yield AI agents with economic behaviors that are consistent with economic intuition, for example agents that specialize as a consequence of their inherent skill level. Our experiments also show that policies trained in such simulators can transfer well to settings with human participants, albeit for our limited problem setting.
Of course, these kinds of economic simulations still have many limitations. They do not yet model human-behavioral factors and interactions between people, including other-regarding utilities, and consider a relatively small economy. Moreover, the concept of skill and the associated payoff, as used in our work, is still a limited representation of economic behavior in the real world. For instance, highly-skilled workers are not paid the same hourly wage across different industries, and skill might be hard to clearly define and measure clearly in certain professions. Future simulations could improve the fidelity of simulated economic behavior by making use of real-world economic data, while advances in large-scale RL and engineering could increase the scope of economic simulations.
Ethics and Normative Aspects
Ethics, trust, and transparency are an integral part of Salesforce's approach to AI research. While the current version of the AI Economist provides only a limited representation of the real world, we recognize that it could be possible to manipulate future, large-scale iterations of the AI Economist to increase inequality and hide this action behind the results of an AI system.
Furthermore, either out of ignorance or malice, bad training data may result in biased recommendations, particularly in cases where users will train the tool using their own data. For instance, the exclusion from the model of communities and segments of the work-force that are under-represented in training data might lead to bias in AI-driven tax models. This work also opens up the possibility of using richer, observational data to set individual taxation, an area where we anticipate a strong need for robust debate.
Economic simulation enables studying a wide range of economic incentives and their consequences, including models of stakeholder capitalism. However, the simulation used in this work is not an actual tool that can be currently used with malintent to reconfigure tax policy. We encourage anyone utilizing the AI Economist to publish a model card and data sheet that describes the ethical considerations of trained AI-driven tax models to increase transparency, and by extension, trust, in the system. Furthermore, we believe any future application or policy built on economic simulations should be built on inspectable code and subject to full transparency.
In order to responsibly publish this research, we have taken the following measures:
· To ensure accountability on our part, we have consulted academic experts on safe release of code and ensured we are in compliance with their guidance. We shared the paper and an assessment of the ethical risks, mitigation strategies, and assessment of safety to publish with the following external reviewers: Dr. Simon Chesterman, Provost's Chair and Dean of the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law, and Lofred Madzou, AI Project Lead at the World Economic Forum's Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. None of the reviewers identified additional ethical concerns or mitigation strategies that should be employed. All affirmed that the research is safe to publish.
· To increase transparency, we are publishing this technical paper, as well as a blog post, thereby allowing robust debate and broad multidisciplinary discussion of our work.

· To further promote transparency, we will have a timed open-source release of our environment and sample training code for the simulation. This does not prevent future misuse, but we believe, at the current level of fidelity, transparency is key to promote grounded discussion and future research.
With these mitigation strategies and other considerations in place, we believe this research is safe to publish. Furthermore, this research was not conducted with any corporate or commercial applications in mind.

A Details of Environment
This section provides a more exhaustive description of the environment dynamics and the observations (and, where appropriate, actions) available to agents and the social planner. We describe these separately for each of the mechanics used to construct the simulation. Note that observations and actions are essentially the inputs and outputs of the neural network policies trained using RL. Planner observations/actions are irrelevant for baseline tax models, where tax rates are either fixed or calculated formulaically.
World Dynamics. The Gather-and-Build environment is organized over a D grid. Grid cells can be occupied by agents, resources, houses, or other landmarks such as water. At the start of each episode, certain cells are designated as `source' cells that function to spawn new resource units. A given source cell only spawns a single type of resource, i.e. wood or stone. If an agent moves to a cell that contains a resource, that resource is added to the agent's inventory and removed from the world at that location. At the start of each timestep, resources randomly re-spawn at empty source cells according to the regeneration probability.
The state of the world is represented as a H × W × C tensor, where H and W are the size of the world and C is the number of unique entities that may occupy a cell, and the value of a given element indicates that a particular entity is occupying the associated location. The social planner is able to observe the full world state tensor, while agent observations are restricted to views of the state tensor from a narrower, egocentric spatial window. Our experiments use a world of size -by- , where agent observations have size -by- . Agent spatial observations are padded as needed when their observation window extends beyond the world grid.
Movement and Gathering. Agents must navigate the world in order to collect resources and build new houses. The action space of the agents includes actions for moving up, down, left, and right. Agents are restricted from moving on top of water cells, cells occupied by other agents, and cells containing houses built by other agents. In this way, agents may create difficulty for other agents by restricting their available paths.
Before resources may be sold or used to build houses, they must be collected from the world. An agent collects resources by moving itself on top of a resource-populated source cell. By default, this adds a single unit of the collected resources to the agent's inventory, with the possibility of a bonus unit also being collected, the probability of which is determined by the agent's collecting skill.
Agents observe the state of their inventories (including wood, stone, and coin) as well as their own collecting skill. The planner is also able to observe agents' inventories but cannot observe skill values.
Building. When an agent has both stone and wood in its inventory, it may spend one unit of each in order to construct a house. The action space of the agents includes action for building. Agents are restricted from building on source cells as well as locations where a house already exists. Building places a house at the location occupied by the agent and adds coin to the agent's inventory, the amount of which is determined by its building skill. Agents observe their own building skill, which the planner is not able to observe.
For our purposes, we use the same, fixed layout of source cells each episode.

Trading. Agents can buy and sell resources from one another through a trading mechanism structured as a continuous double auction. This is conceptually similar to a commodities or stock exchange, where participants do not interface directly but instead submit bids and asks to a market, which identifies and executes valid trades. The action space of the agents includes actions for trading, representing the combination of price levels (0, . . . , 10 coin), directions (bids and asks), and resources (wood and stone). Note: agents buy resources by submitting bids and sell resources by submitting asks. Each trade action therefore maps to a single order (i.e. bid coin for wood, ask for coin in exchange for stone, etc.). Once an order is submitted, it remains open until either it is matched (in which case a trade occurs) or it expires (after timesteps). Agents are restricted from having more than open orders for each resource and are restricted from placing orders that they cannot complete: they cannot bid with more coin than they possess and cannot submit asks for resources that they do not have.
A bid/ask pair form a valid trade if they are for the same resource and the bid price matches or exceeds the ask price. When a new order is received (i.e. bid coin for wood) it is compared against complementary orders to identify potential valid trades. When a single bid (ask) could be paired with multiple existing asks (bids), priority is giving the ask (bid) with the lowest (highest) price; in the event of ties, priority then is given to the oldest existing order. Once a match is identified, the trade is executed using the price of whichever order was placed first. As an example, if the market receives a new bid that offers coin for stone and the market has two open asks offering stone for coin and stone for coin, respectively, the market would pair the bid with the first ask and a trade would be executed for stone at a price of coin: the bidding agent loses
coin and gains stone and the asking agent loses stone and gains coin. Once a bid and ask are paired and the trade is executed, both orders are removed from the market.
The state of the market is captured by the number of outstanding bids and asks at each price level for each resource. Agents observe these counts both for their own bids/asks as well as the cumulative bids/asks of other agents (representing the bids/asks that they could respond to). The planner observes the cumulative bids/asks of all agents. In addition, both agents and the planner observe some historical information from the market: (for each resource) the average trading price as well as the number of trades at each price level.
Taxation and Redistribution. The main text describes the general implementation of periodic, bracketed taxes used in our environment (Section . ). On the first timestep of each tax period, the planner sets the marginal tax rates that will be used to collect taxes when the tax period ends. For baseline models, these are set either formulaically or using fixed rates. For taxes controlled by a deep neural network (i.e. AI Economist), the action space of the planner is divided into seven action subspaces, one for each tax bracket: {0, 0.05, 0.10, . . . , 1.0}7. Each subspace denotes the set of discretized marginal tax rates that the planner may select. The action space takes this form because, when setting new rates, the planner samples rates at once.
Agents observe:
· The tax rates of the current tax period
· The marginal rate at the income level earned within the current period so far
· Indicators of the temporal progress of the current tax period
· The set of sorted and anonymized incomes the agents reported in the previous period
The planner observes the same information as well as the non-anonymized income and marginal tax rate (at that income) of each agent in the previous period.
Discretization of tax rates only applies to deep learning networks.

Action Details. In our implementation, both agents and planners use discrete action spaces. One advantage of this choice is that it grants easier control over which actions the agent/planner models can sample at a given time. We encode this using `action masks' which we use to ensure that the policy network assigns effectively probability to restricted actions. Action masking is useful for preventing invalid actions and is how we control the tax annealing (see Section . ) for the AI Economist experiments.
In addition to the actions described above, we include a NO-OP action ("no operation") in each action space. (For the planner, each of the action subspaces includes a NO-OP action.) The NO-OP action is interpreted as essentially taking no action, allowing the agent to "idle" and the planner to leave a bracket's tax rates unchanged between periods.
Most importantly, we use these implementation features to enable the planner to observe every timestep while only acting at the start of each new tax period. For timesteps other than those at the start of a tax period we simply use the action mask to enforce that only NO-OP actions are sampled. This allows the planner to use rich temporal information while also ensuring that policy gradients are only propagated from the action samples used to control taxes.

B Training Hyperparameters and Experiment Settings

For each experiment, experience collection was parallelized over replicas of the environment. Each training

iteration involved collecting h steps from each replica (using the latest policy parameters), followed by a

round of parameter updates using the collected samples. With a sampling horizon of timesteps and

environment replicas, a total of

timesteps were sampled per training iteration. Since each "agent"

experiences its transition per timestep, this is actually a total of

transitions:

for the agents and

for the planner. When doing policy updates, we divided each such set of transitions into minibatches

of size and perform one gradient update per minibatch. Therefore, each training iteration involved

updates to the agent parameters and to the planner parameters. We use PPO to accomodate multiple updates

per training iteration.

Tables and provide details regarding the training hyperparameters and environment settings, respec-

tively, used in our AI experiments.

Figure : The starting point for each experiment was the lobby and tutorial (Figure ). The tutorial explained all rules of the world and the objective for each participant. It also explained how the variable part of payment for the experiment was computed. In addition, an example of the graphical interface and keyboard controls was shown. Participants were warned not to idle in the game. Participants were given minutes before the start of the experiment to read the tutorial. After this initial period, as soon as there were enough participants to form a group, the lobby system presented the participants in the new group with the experiment's main page.

Figure : The main experiment's graphical user interface (Figure ) showed (from top to bottom): the endowment of the agent, the remaining time in the episode, the bonus amount earned so far, the spatial state of the world, the tax information and current tax rate, the time left, the number of houses built and the number of profitable houses left to build. Below all data, a reminder of the controls was shown as well. After an episode was over, participants were returned to the lobby (if the participant had seen less than episodes) or survey (if episodes had been seen).

Figure : The post-experiment survey showed how much the participant had collected in terms of resources, coin and bonus. It also asked questions about the participants experience, strategy and general feedback on the experiment. For instance, participants could communicate technical issues, such as lag. At the end of the survey, participants were given a confirmation code that allowed them to confirm successful completion of the task on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform.
