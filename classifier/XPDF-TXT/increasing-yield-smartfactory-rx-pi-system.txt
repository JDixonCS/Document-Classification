Increasing Compression Yield

Business Challenge
 Need to increase yield on Press  Minimal data integration: Process
environmental, LIMS, CQA, maintenance
Solution
 Integrate data contributing for yield  Strategy for managing process and
maintenance interaction  Analytics to monitor, control, and
improve process understanding  Both MVA and UVA statistical
process control methods to reduce tablet scrap  Operator Dashboard: Green means GOOD!  Prescriptive corrective action

Results
 Deliver actionable insights to shop floor
 Improve process robustness  Workflows in place to increase
yield  Minimize process variability
with run to run control
