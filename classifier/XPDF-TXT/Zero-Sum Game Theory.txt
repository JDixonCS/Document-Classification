Game Theory

A pure strategy for a player is a mapping from all the possible states that player could see to the move the player would make.

Four pure strategies for A: A's Strategy I: (1L , 4L) A's Strategy II: (1L , 4R) A's Strategy III: (1R , 4L) A's Strategy IV: (1R , 4R)
Three pure strategies for B: B's Strategy I: (2L , 3R) B's Strategy II: (2M , 3R) B's Strategy III: (2R , 3R)
In general, if each player can see N possible states, and there are b moves from each state, how many pure strategies?

Minimax with Matrix Forms

A can decide from this matrix which

B-I B-II B-III

strategy is best. For each strategy, A

A-I 7

3

-1

considers the worst-case counter strategy

by B. A chooses the row with the

A-II 7

3

4

maximum minimum value. For A, the

A-III 2

2

2

value of the game is this value.

A-IV 2

2

2

In this example A chooses A-II, and says game has

value 3.

When B decides which strategy is best, B searches for which column has the minimum maximum value.

In this example, B chooses B-II, and says game has value 3.

Fundamental game theory result (proved by von Neumann):

In a 2-player, zero-sum game of perfect information,

Minimax==Maximin. And there always exists an optimal

pure strategy for each player.

Slide 7

2 player zero-sum finite NONdeterministic games of perfect information

The search tree now includes states where neither player makes a choice, but instead a random decision is made according to a known set of outcome probabilities.

Game theory value of a state is the expected final value if both players

are optimal.

The i, j'th entry holds the expected amount A will win if A follows its i'th strategy and B it's j'th. Von Neumann's result still holds. Minimax=Maximin.

Slide 9

Two person zero-sum finite games, hidden information

Examples: Poker, 2-player bridge, Scrabble, Diplomacy. This gets very interesting.

Bottom line: Foundations of economic theory and "multiple agent" decision-making start here.

Bad news: The computational complexity of these foundations makes chess look like integer multiplication.

Imagine a version of mini-poker in which Red cards are bad for A and Black cards are good.

Player A is dealt a card. It is red or black with 50% probability.

A may resign if the card is red: A loses 20c Else A "holds".
B may then resign: A wins 10c B may "see":
If card is red: A loses 40c If card is black: A wins 30c

Mini-Poker Pure Strategies

In games of hidden information, pure strategies are mappings from all possible states that the player can detect to moves.

p=0.5
( red )-a

( )-chance

p=0.5
( black )-a

B can't distinguish between these.

( ahold )-b

( ahold )-b

( arsgn ) -20

( brsgn ) +10

( bsee ) -40

( brsgn ) +10

( bsee ) +30

For Player A there are two pure strategies: Strategy RESIGNER: Resign if card = Red Strategy HOLDER: Hold if card = Red
For Player B there are two pure strategies: Strategy RESIGNER: Resign if A holds Strategy SEER: If A holds then see
If A is a resigner, how much will A win on average? Depends on B's strategy! If B is a resigner, how much will A win on average? Depends on A's strategy.

With hidden information, Minimax no longer necessarily equals Maximin. A's optimal strategy depends on B's and vice versa. What can we do? What should a computer program for playing A do?

Von Neumann's game theoretic values for games of hidden information
It turns out for the game of mini-poker, the game theoretic value for A is 1c. A can expect to win 1 cent per game on average if A does the right thing.
Furthermore, A can even tell B in advance what A's strategy is. That information will not help B!
Slide 13
Mixed Strategies
The trick is that A must not use a pure strategy, but a mixed strategy, in which at the start of the game (before play) A selects which pure strategy it will use for that game at random. And there will be an optimal probability distribution for it.
For mini-poker, A must decide to be a holder with probability p and a resigner with probability 1-p. How do we compute the optimal p?
Slide 14

Computing a mixed strategy for A: Guess number one: p=2/3

A-resigner A-holder

B-resigner -5 +10

B-seer +5 -5

Suppose A chooses to be a holder with probability p = 2/3. Suppose B knows this.

Which strategy will B pick?

How much will A win on average?

Slide 15

Computing a mixed strategy for A: Guess number two: p=1/3

A-resigner A-holder

B-resigner -5 +10

B-seer +5 -5

Suppose A chooses to be a holder with probability p = 1/3. Suppose B knows this.

Which strategy will B pick?

How much will A win on average?

Computing a mixed strategy for A:

B-seer +5 -5

Suppose A chooses to be a holder with probability p.

If B uses the pure strategy of resigner, A's expected profit is 15p - 5.

A's expected winnings

If B uses the pure strategy of seer, A's expected profit is 5 - 10p.

Suppose A knows B will always use the most annoying pure strategy. What p would A use?

The point where the two lines (15p Г 5 and 5 Г 10p) meet is where p = 0.4.

And then the expected profit is 1 cent if B is a seer.

And the expected profit is 1 cent if B is a resigner.

A's expected winnings

What if B uses a mixed strategy (choose seer with prob q and resigner with

prob 1-q)?

q = 0.5 q = 0.6 q = 0.75

Whatever B's mixed strategy, A is still guaranteed 1 cent.

и Say Player A will use strategy I with prob p.

и Compute Player A's expected gains if B uses pure strategy 1: m11p + m21(1-p)
и Compute Player A's gains if B uses pure strategy 2: m12p + m22(1-p)
и Find the p between 0 and 1 that maximizes

min( m11p + m21(1-p) , m12p + m22(1-p) )

Since the two lines are, er, linear, the optimum will be either at p = 0, or p

= 1, or at the p which makes the two expressions equal.

Slide 19

Recipe for computing A's optimal mixed strategy for a nXm game

(nXm game = game with a matrix form in which A has n pure strategies and B
has m.)
Say Player A will use strategy 1 with prob p1. Say Player A will use strategy 2 with prob p2.
: Say Player A will use strategy n with prob pn.
Player A's expected gains if B uses pure strategy 1: eg1 = m11p1 + m21p2 + ... + mn1pn
Player A's expected gains if B uses pure strategy 2: eg2 = m12p1 + m22p2 + ... + mn2pn
:

Player A's expected gains if B uses pure strategy m: egm = m1mp1 + m2mp2 + ... + mnmpn

Choose p1 , p2 ии pn to maximize min(eg1, eg2, ... , egn)
subject to pi = 1 and 0  pi  1 for all i.

You are planning a meal out with your date. Unfortunately both you and your date happen to be game theorists. Worse still (and with desperate implausibility) you have diametrically opposed views as to what makes a good meal. You agree that in order to decide:

You'll choose between Mexican and Thai food. Your companion will choose the location from: Atwood Street, Walnut Street, or Monroeville. You will choose simultaneously.

You generally like Mexican food. The Mexican at Atwood Street gives you three units of gustatory joy. The Walnut Mexican gives you just one unit. But the Monroeville Mexican is -4 units: you strongly dislike that Mall-style cuisine. As for Thai, you are not so keen. Monroeville offers reasonable Thai (one unit). Atwood you dislike (-3 units) and Walnut Street's Thai is also bad, giving you -2 units of joy.

As mentioned, your companion has opposite tastes: any joy units you have are

negated from your companion's perspective. Your companion would wish to

minimize your joy units as much as you wish to maximize them. Fearing your

companion's game theoretic powers of analysis, what is your minimax optimal

mixed strategy for selecting between Mexican and Thai dinner? And what is

your expected number of gustatory joy units?
