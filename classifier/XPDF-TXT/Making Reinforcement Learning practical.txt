I  S : S x A  [0 1] (s) is the termination set

    

Types of Decompositions
· Things-to-do: Options
­ Offer coherent, near-optimal sequences of actions for solving subtasks
­ For example "go to the closest food"
· Things-not-to-do: Constraints
­ Indicate sequences of actions that should be taken to stay alive within the domain
­ For example "avoid ghost"

MCTS
Useful in problems with large state spaces Requires lots of samples to get a good estimate Planning time independent of the total number of the states Running time exponential in the effective horizon (H)
