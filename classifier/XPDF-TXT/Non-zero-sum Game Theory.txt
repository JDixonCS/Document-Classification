Fundamental Theorems

и In the n-player pure strategy game G={S1 S2 ии Sn; u1 u2 ии un}, if iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies eliminates all but the strategies (S1* , S2* ии Sn*) then these strategies are the unique NE of the game
и Any NE will survive iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies
и [Nash, 1950] If n is finite and Si is finite i, then there exists at least one NE (possibly involving mixed strategies)

Double Auction: Final Comments
и There are other Nash Equilibrium strategies.
и But the one we saw is provably most efficient.
и In general, even for arbitrary prob. dists. of Vs and Vb, no efficient NE's can exist.
и And no other games for this kind of trading can exist and be efficient.

Double Auction Discussion

What if seller used "giant eagle" tactics?

Seller states "I'll sell it to you for price p : take it or leave it"

Exercise:

и How should* seller choose price (taking into account Vs of course) ?

и And how should* buyer choose whether to buy ? *(at a B.N.E.)

и When could/should double auction technology be used?

и (How) can "Vs,Vb drawn randomly from [0,1]" be relaxed ?

First Price Sealed Bid

Seller wants to sell an object that has no value to seller... anything seller is paid is pure profit.
There are n available buyers
Assumptions:
и Assume buyer i has a value for the object distributed uniformly randomly in [0...1]Vi
и Assume Vi's all independent и Buyer i does not know Vj for i?j и Buyer i does know all Vj's randomly generated from
[0,1]

First Price Sealed Bid Rules
Each buyer writes down their bid.
Call buyer i's bid gi Buyer who wrote highest bid must buy object from seller at price=bid
Question: Why is "bid = Vi" a stupid strategy ??

Auction Analysis: Back to Bayesian Nash Equils

This assumption is completely unjustified right now. Later we'll see why it was an okay assumption to make.

We'll assume that all players other than i do a linear strategy:
gj*(Vj) = mjVj for j ? i
Then what should i do ?

Thus we've an N.E. because if all other players use a linear strategy then it's in i's interest to do so too. Above holds i

First-Price Sealed Auction
At BNE all players use gi*(Vi) = (1-1/n)Vi
Note: [Fact of probability] Expected value of the largest of n numbers drawn independently from [0,1] is n n+1
Expected profit to seller = what?

Second-Price Sealed Bid
A different game: Each buyer writes their bid Buyer with highest bid must buy the object But the price they pay is the second highest bid
и What is player i's best strategy и Why? и What is seller's expected profit?

Auction Comments

и Second-price auction is preferred by cognoscenti
п No more efficient п But general purpose п And computationally better п And less variance (better risk management)
и Auction design is interesting
п So far mostly for economics п But soon for e-commerce etc.?
и Important but not covered here
п Expertise п Collusion п Combinatoric Auctions п What if all cooperative ????
