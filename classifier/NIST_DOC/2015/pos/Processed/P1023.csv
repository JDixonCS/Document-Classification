5,"Knowledge about a (Web) document's creation time has been shown to be an important factor in various temporal information retrieval settings. Commonly, it is assumed that such documents were created at a single point in time. While this assumption may hold for news articles and similar document types, it is a clear oversimplification for general Web documents. In this paper, we investigate to what extent (i) this simplifying assumption is violated for a corpus of Web documents, and, (ii) it is possible to accurately estimate the creation time of individual Web documents' components (socalled sub-documents).",null,null

7,1. INTRODUCTION,null,null
8,"Accurately estimating at what point in time a (Web) document has originally been created is of importance for a number of applications, including the tracking of ideas over time, the detection of copied content, and temporal information retrieval (IR) -- for some topics users might prefer to be served older Web documents, while for others users may prefer more recently created content. Current research in Web-document based temporal IR usually considers either the documents' creation timestamp (i.e. when the document first appeared on the Web) or the extracted content timestamps (i.e. which time periods the document contains information about) as a raw signal to be included in retrieval models [2]. In this work we focus on the creation time of Web documents. Previous work, e.g. [9, 5, 8], has made the simplifying assumption that each Web document di has been created at one moment in time ti and ti can either be approximated by the first time the document (its URL) was crawled or by the first/oldest timestamp appearing in the document content. On the Web this is a highly unrealistic assumption -- documents are constantly",null,null

While the different subdocuments of a blog page may be easy to timestamp, for many other types of Web documents this is harder. Thus, in this work, we aim to arrive at a first understanding of sub-document timestamping. Specifically, we empirically investigate the following two research themes:",null,null
13,RT1: To what extent do Web documents consist of subdocuments created at different times? What kind of documents contain two or more sub-documents? What is the timespan between the oldest and most recent sub-document of a document?,null,null

What document features are most useful in the classification? Which type of sub-documents can we most accurately identify?",null,null
15,We investigate a subset of documents from the ClueWeb12 corpus1 and date each document's paragraphs (a paragraph is a sub-document) individually based on historic Web crawl data collected from the Internet Archive2 (IA).,null,null
16,"Having dated all sub-documents, we first analyse this corpus of sub-documents before turning towards estimating the creation time of each sub-document with a standard machine learning pipeline. We find that two thirds of the investigated Web documents (66.5%) do indeed contain sub-documents created at different points in time. More importantly, we also find a large gap between the oldest and most recently created subdocument (1052 days on average), indicating that relying on a single creation timestamp per document provides at best a very distorted picture of the true creation times. Classifying sub-documents according to their creation time using only sub-document internal features is possible with more than 66% of instances correctly classified.",null,null

18,"Document creation timestamps are used in different temporal IR settings, such as timeline construction [11, 5], improving retrieval relevance [10, 8] and the estimation of a document's focus time [7].

[9] improve the temporal language model by using word interpolation, temporal entropy and external search statistics. They rely on documents recorded on the IA for their experiments, with the document's creation time being the first recorded crawl within the IA. Chambers et al. [3] use machine learning to infer documents' cration timestamps based on the temporal expressions by leveraging the MaxEnt model and additional time constraints. Ge et al. [6] propose an event-based time label propagation model by using the relationship between events and documents (exploiting the fact that news articles are often about events). All these works infer a single creation time per document. In fact, most works [4, 9, 3, 6] rely on news corpora, which by design are rarely (or never) updated and usually contain an easily accessible creation timestamp. For general Web documents, there is little research work on inferring the subdocument creation timestamps. We attempt to fill this gap with our work.",null,null
23,3. APPROACH,null,null
24,"To investigate our research questions we require a set of Web documents for which to determine the sub-document creation times. Instead of randomly sampling Web documents, we rely on the 11, 075 relevant documents Drel available for the ClueWeb12 corpus (topics topics 201-300), which consists of more than 700 million English Web documents and was crawled between 02/2012 and 05/2012. We thus investigate documents that are at least relevant to some information needs based on their textual content, avoiding Web spam documents and Web documents that contain very little to no text in the process.",null,null
25,"Historical Versions Extraction In Fig. 1 we present an overview of our pipeline. For each document in Drel (identified through its URL), we retrieve all available historic versions from the IA, which began archiving Web documents in 1996. 7118 of the documents in Drel contain at least one historic version. We continue our processing with those documents only (Draerlchived). On average we are able to identify 17 historic versions per document in Draerlchived.",null,null
26,"Sub-document Extraction In the second step we identify the different sub-documents of each document di  Draerlchived as well as the sub-documents of di's m historic versions Histi ,"" {dhi 1 , dhi 2 , ..., dhi m } where h1 is the most recent archived version of di (most recent but older than di's""",null,null

A sub-document is then a fraction split by tags <p> or <div>, which contains at least 50 non-markup characters. We empirically found this process to be a simple but robust mechanism to identify subdocuments. The number of sub-documents identified are on average 39 per document (median 21).""",null,null

The features are listed in Tab. 1. All features are based on the non-markup content extracted for a particular subdocument. While features F1 to F9 gather basic paragraph and sentence statistics, features F10 to F21 are based on the temporal expressions (TEs) we extract from a sub-document3. TEs can be classified into four different categories, depending on the specificity of the information: [F12] Date (e.g. Feb. 18, 2015 ), [F13] Duration (e.g. from 1996 to 2012 ), [F14] Time (e.g. 1pm) and [F15] Set (e.g. every weekend ). Since the focus of our work is an exploratory analysis of sub-document timestamping, we chose an established classifier with fixed parameter settings (Random Forest [1] with 5 features per tree and 100 trees in total) instead of experimenting with different algorithms and configurations.

That is, class A contains those sub-documents created within the first 20 days of the page crawl time, while class E contains those subdocuments created more than 6 years before the page was actually crawled. We chose these interval settings to create a balanced data-set: each class has 55K instances. In a second set of experiments we consider a subset of all instances, namely those 120K in which each sub-document contains at least one TE, as we aim to investigate the effect TEs have on the accuracy of the classification.

78,"Let us first consider RT1 and the question to what extent sub-document timestamping is actually an issue on the Web. In Fig. 2 we plot the number of documents within Draerlchived and the number of different timestamps we assigned to their respective sub-documents. Overall, 62.5% of documents have between 2 and 8 creation timestamps; very few documents contain content created at eight or more different times (4%). Since not only the number of different creation timestamps a document possesses, but also the time interval between the timestamps is important, in Fig. 3 we present the average difference (in days) between the oldest and most recent creation timestamp of a document, with the document set partitioned according to the total number of creation timestamps found in a document. For documents with two creation timestamps, the median difference is 400 days, i.e. 50% of those documents contain content created more than one year apart. Considering these numbers we next investigate how much content is created at different points in time. For each document di ,"" {s1,i, s2,i, .., sk,i}  Draerlchived with 2, 3 or 4 creation timestamps we determined what fraction of document content was created when. The results are shown in Fig. 4. Here, we consider all sub-documents (i.e. the nonmarkup text) of di as 100% of the content and compute what percentage of text was existing at each creation timestamp.""",null,null

80,"This is a simplification of how Web documents are maintained (content might also be updated, deleted and added again over time). However, since we use the content of di as our starting point, we are only interested in the time a particular sub-document of di was first created. The graph shows that most content is created initially -- for documents with 2 creation timestamps, on average 78% of the content is available after the first version of the document. For documents with 3 and 4 creation timestamps, 68% and 55% of content are created initially.

136,"Our vision is to eventually develop techniques that are reliably able to tag any Web page's sub-documents with an accurate estimate of their creation time. To answer the questions raised in RT2, we consider the results of the creation timestamp classification experiments in Tab. 2. The Random Forest (RF) classifier classifies 65% of the instances correctly, independent of the existence of TEs in a subdocument (rows 1 & 2). Instances of class E (i.e. those sub-documents created 6+ years before the page crawl time) can be classified with highest accuracy. We also present the results of two baselines for those instances that contain one or more TEs: using as single feature either the oldest or most recent TE for classification purposes only. About two thirds of the instances are not correctly classified showing that TEs alone are not sufficient in this setup and additional features (which on first sight may not always be pertinent to creation timestamps) are required.",null,null

138,"Our work shows that sub-document timestamping is an issue which should be considered when employing document creation timestamps in IR applications. Not only the amount of documents containing content created at several points in time is significant, but also the interval between the changes is considerable. One of the limitations of our work is the fact that we relied on the Internet Archive and its historic versions of a document to determine each sub-document's creation time. While this approach yields very precise results for documents archived often by the Internet Archive, for less well-archived documents the temporal resolution is limited5. For this rea-",null,null
