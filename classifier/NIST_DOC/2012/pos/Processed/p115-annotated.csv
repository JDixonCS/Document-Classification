15,"Aggregating search results from a variety of heterogeneous sources or verticals such as news, image and video into a single interface is a popular paradigm in web search. Although various approaches exist for selecting relevant verticals or optimising the aggregated search result page, evaluating the quality of an aggregated page is an open question. This paper proposes a general framework for evaluating the quality of aggregated search pages. We evaluate our approach by collecting annotated user preferences over a set of aggregated search pages for 56 topics and 12 verticals. We empirically demonstrate the fidelity of metrics instantiated from our proposed framework by showing that they strongly agree with the annotated user preferences of pairs of simulated aggregated pages. Furthermore, we show that our metrics agree with the majority user preference more often than the current diversity-based information retrieval metrics. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by showing that personalised historical preference data can improve the performance of our proposed metrics.",null,null

25,"a set of specific verticals dispersed throughout the standard ""general web"" results, for example by adding image results to the ten blue links for the query ""pictures of flowers"". This new search paradigm is often known as aggregated search [4]. The three main challenges that arise in realising such systems are vertical selection (VS), item selection (IS), and result presentation (RP). Vertical selection deals with deciding which verticals are implicitly intended by a query. Item selection deals with selecting a subset of items from each vertical to present on the aggregated page. Result presentation deals with organising and embedding the various types of items on the result page. The most common presentation strategy for aggregated search is to merge the results into one ranked list of so-called blocks, and is now the `de facto' standard in many search engines.",null,null
,,,
26,"Although various approaches exist for selecting relevant verticals [4, 5] and for optimising aggregated search pages [2, 17], evaluating the quality of aggregated search pages is still a challenge. Consider the query ""yoga poses"" which suggests that a visual element in the result page would be useful to many users. Furthermore consider that 75% of users who issue this query would prefer ""image"" results, 60% would prefer ""video"" results, and 10% would prefer ""news"" results, to ""general web"" results. Figure 1 shows three possible aggregated search pages1 (A, B, and C) for the sample query. It is clearly difficult to objectively ascertain the aggregated search page that represents a more effective returned set, as there are a variety of compounding factors that could affect a user preference. A user may prefer a page because of his/her preference towards a specific vertical (vertical preference). In such a case, a user may prefer page A because it contains more images. A user who prefers a result set with more items that are topically relevant might prefer page C, whereas a user who prefers more relevant items towards the top of the page (presentation preference) might prefer page B. Furthermore, a user who desires a more diverse returned set (vertical diversity) may prefer page C. Any combination of those factors can influence the perceived quality and user preference of the pages.",null,null

,,,
35,"Various works evaluating one component of an aggregated search system in isolation exist. Vertical selection in aggregated search has been studied in [4, 5, 15, 26]. Much of this research aims to measure the quality of the set of selected verticals, compared with an annotated set obtained by collecting manual labels from assessors [4, 5, 26] or derived from user interaction data [15]. The annotation can be binary [4, 5] or graded [26]. The quality of a particular vertical selection approach is mostly evaluated with standard measures of precision and recall using the binary annotated set. Our work also evaluates this key component by utilising graded vertical-orientation information derived from a multi-assessor preferred vertical annotation set [26], as this allows for a more refined evaluation scheme.",null,null

36,"Recent attempts to evaluate the utility of the whole aggregated search page [3, 17] consider the three key components of aggregated search (VS, IS, RP) together. Our work takes a similar holistic approach and proposes a general evaluation framework for measuring aggregated search page",null,null

37,"quality. For example, [17] evaluate the utility of a page based on a user engagement metric (CTR). This evaluation framework requires large-scale user interaction data, which may not always be available. In addition, it is not feasible to collect user interaction data for all possible page combinations. Others [6] evaluate the utility of the page by asking annotators to make assessments based on a number of criteria (e.g. relevance, diversity). Although this work is a comprehensive way to evaluate aggregated pages, it remains costly to gather assessments for all possible aggregated pages.",null,null
,,,
38,"The most similar work [3] to ours collects preferences on block pairs from users and measures the page quality by calculating the distance between the page in question and the ideal (reference) page; the shorter the distance, the better the page. One advantage is that any possible combination of vertical blocks that form an aggregated page can be tested, from a block-oriented point of view (without regard to item selection). However, when the results retrieved for a vertical (block) change, the assessments previously gathered may not be reusable, as the preference will undoubtedly change accordingly. As our work follows the Cranfield paradigm, once the assessments (both item topical-relevance and verticalorientation) are gathered, it can be applied to evaluate any possible aggregated search page (any combination of vertical selection, item selection and result presentation). Therefore, our work leads to a more robust, inexpensive, and reusable approach for evaluating aggregated search pages.",null,null
,,,
39,"Topical diversity is an important topic. Various diversityaware IR metrics have been proposed [8, 10, 18], capturing the importance of each subtopic, the degree to which an item represents the subtopic, and the topical-relevance of the item. Diversity-based metrics can promote returned sets that are both topically relevant and diverse. A simplistic way of adapting these metrics to aggregated search is to treat subtopics as verticals and subtopic importance as verticalorientation. In this way, all existing diversity-based IR metrics can be adapted to evaluate aggregated search. Although in principle suitable to evaluate aggregated search, diversitybased metrics are not appropriate for use with block-based pages where user behaviour is different; for instance user browsing behavior within a block containing images may be different to that within a block containing ""general web"" results. Furthermore, the various types of items (text, image, etc.) that need to be accounted for in an aggregated search scenario are not explicitly modelled in diversity-based met-",null,null

It can be noted that the framework developed in this paper can also be extended to incorporate topical diversity, but due to space limitations, we will leave this as future work.",null,null

43,3. PROBLEM FORMULATION,null,null
,,,
44,We introduce some formal notation and outline some of the main assumptions used throughout this work.,null,null
,,,
45,3.1 Aggregated Page Composition,null,null
,,,
46,"An aggregated search page P is composed of a set of blocks {B1, B2, ...Bn}, where each block Bi consists of a set of items {Ii1, Ii2, ...Iim}. An item can be a ""general web"" page or a vertical result. Only snippets of each item appear on the aggregated search page. We make several assumptions2 about the page P : (i) results are presented into blocks from top to bottom, and within each block, items are shown either from left to right (Image, Video) or from top to bottom (News, Recipe); (ii) each block Bi consists of items originating from only one vertical; (iii) only one block of each type is placed on a page (with the exception of ""general web"" blocks); and (iv) a block consists of one `general web' item or k vertical items. This is different to previous work [3, 17] where vertical block could be embedded into only three positions of ""general web"" results (top of the page, middle of the page, bottom of the page). We relax this assumption and allow a vertical block to be slotted between any two ""general web"" blocks on the page.",null,null
,,,
47,3.2 Relevance and Orientation,null,null
,,,
48,"Our objective is to develop metrics that measure the quality of any possible aggregated search page. The metrics must work regardless of the selected verticals, the items retrieved from each vertical, and where the vertical results are positioned on the page. To achieve this, we assume that the following two types of relevance assessments are available:",null,null
,,,
49,"· The topical-relevance of each item, which is an assessment indicating whether a given item Iij within block Bi is topically relevant to a topic q3. This is denoted qrel(Iij |q).",null,null
,,,
50,"· The user specific vertical-orientation [26], which is a value between zero and one indicating the fraction of users that prefer a page to contain items from the vertical Vi rather than ""general web"" results for a topic q. This is denoted orient(Vi|W, q).",null,null
,,,
51,The two relevance assessments are assumed to be made independently. The concept of vertical-orientation [26] reflects the perceived usefulness of a vertical from the user perspective prior to viewing vertical results and without regard to the quality of the vertical results. The vertical-orientation assessment is obtained by comparing each vertical in turn to,null,null
,,,
52,"2These assumptions are made in accordance with existing aggregated search systems. 3In this work, we assume that topical-relevance assessments are binary.",null,null
,,,
53,"the reference ""general web"" vertical, by asking users whether items from this vertical are likely to improve the quality of a standard web page. Consequently, the vertical orientation of the Web (orient(W |W, q)) is deemed to be 0.5, as we can imagine that a user would randomly select a page when presented with two similar ""general web"" pages. The topical-relevance assessment of each item contributes to the measurement of relevance for each retrieved result. This type of assessment can be made using similar pooling techniques [13] to those used in TREC.",null,null
,,,
54,"With these two assessment types, we assume that a user obtain the highest reward by reading the most topically relevant item, originating from the most highly oriented vertical, first. With this assumption, only the vertical (or verticals) with a higher orientation than the ""general web"" (orient(V |W, q) > 0.5) should be presented on the aggregated search page; all other verticals should be suppressed.",null,null

55,3.3 User Interaction Behaviour,null,null
,,,
56,We make some assumptions about how users interact with an aggregated search page P :,null,null
,,,
57,"· The user examines each page one block at a time. When the user reads page P , a block Bi on the page P has a certain probability of being examined. This probability denoted Exam(Bi) is estimated depending on the type of browsing model assumed.",null,null
,,,
58,"· After the user decides to examine a block Bi, we assume a static user browsing behavior within the block; the user reads all the items Ii1 to Iim within that block.",null,null
,,,
59,"Given that our metrics are based on average user and that there is usually only a limited number of items per block, this simple within block user browsing model is appropriate.",null,null
,,,
60,4. EVALUATION FRAMEWORK,null,null
,,,
61,"We aim to develop metrics that evaluate an aggregated search page similarly to how a user might. Given two pages P1 and P2, we wish to measure their effectiveness in satisfying a user information need using a utility function U til(P ). If a user prefers P1 over P2 for a given query, the utility measure should lead to U til(P1) > U til(P2).",null,null
,,,
62,"Following [11], the utility of a page is determined by reward and effort. A page with a high utility should satisfy the average user information need with relatively little effort. We define the utility metric U til(P ) of the page P based on all blocks {B1, B2, ...Bn} on the page. When a user reads page P , a block Bi on the page P has a certain probability Exam(Bi) of being examined. This probability might depend on the position of the block presented, the snippet type of the items (image, text) within the block, or the satisfaction level after reading previous blocks B1 to Bi-1. The probability Exam(Bi) can be estimated depending on the type of browsing model assumed.",null,null
,,,
63,"After the user decides to read block Bi, he/she will be rewarded with some gain G(Bi) coming from reading all the items Ii1 to Iim within that block. Here we assume that the topical-relevance of the item snippet is a good indication of the relevance of the item itself. Therefore, by reading all the items within the block Bi, the user will also have spent some effort E(Bi) in reading this block. Therefore, based on our assumptions, we define the utility of the page U til(P ) as",null,null

Furthermore, we would expect that the more topically relevant items a block contains, the higher the gain for the user. We denote the topical-relevance of the block as Topic. Before combining these two factors, we define the gain relating to the vertical-orientation of the block Bi:",null,null

As the ""general web"" is the pivot to which verticals are added, if orient(Vj|W, q) > 0.5, then adding the vertical should be rewarded. If orient(Vj|W, q) < 0.5, the gain of the block should be less than the ""general web"" results (i.e. 0.5). Therefore, we use a pivot at the 0.5 value through which g() must pass.

145,"We concentrate on defining the user browsing model for examining a block Exam(Bi) on a page. Several models exist [8, 9, 16] that aim to predict the probability with which a user will examine an item. Position models [16] use only the position of the item in a result set. The cascade model [8] uses the relevance of the items previously examined, the intuition being that a sufficiently satisfied user will not continue to examine extra items. Motivated by the fact that users tend to be attracted by vertical results and the visual attention on them will increase the examination probability of other nearby web results, the attention model [9] aims to capture the visual attractiveness of the page. We do not propose a new user browsing model for aggregated search. Rather, we adopt these different models and incorporate them into our framework, namely the position examination models DCG [12] and RBP [16], the cascade model ERR [8], and the attention model ATT [9].",null,null

As we do not have access to query logs to accurately estimate the attention bias parameter , instead of assuming that  is a position-specific parameter, we assume that  is a global variable that is constant for all positions. In addition, there will be attention-bias only when results from image or video verticals are presented on the page.

To obtain the latter, we require a brute-force approach that calculates the metric score for all pages, and then selects the page with the maximal score as the ideal page (arg max(U til(P ))P ).

This test collection consists of a number of verticals (listed in Table 3), each populated by items of that vertical type, a set of topics (320) expressing information needs relating to one or more verticals, and assessments indicating the topical-relevance of the items and the perceived user-oriented usefulness of their associated verticals to each of the topics. The verticals are created either by classifying items in the web collections into different genres (e.g. Blog, News) or by adding items from other multimedia collection (e.g. Image, Video). The topics and topical-relevance assessments of items that vary in genres are obtained by reusing assessments developed in TREC evaluation tasks (TREC Web Track and MillionQuery Track). The vertical-orientation information of each topic [26] is obtained by only providing the vertical names (with a description of their characteristics) and asking a set of assessors to make pairwise preference assessments, comparing each vertical in turn to the reference ""general web"" vertical (""is adding results from this vertical likely to improve the quality of the ten blue links?"").",Y,null

221,5.2 Simulating Aggregated Search Pages,null,null
,,,
222,"For each topic, we simulate a set of aggregated search pages. As indicated in Section 3, we assume that a page consists of ten ""general web"" blocks (one ""general web"" page is a block) and up to three vertical blocks dispersed throughout those ten blocks (where each vertical block consists of a fixed number of three items). Recall that there are three key components of an aggregated search system that can be varied: (i) Vertical Selection (VS); (ii) Item Selection (IS); and (iii) Result Presentation (RP). We generate pages by simulating an aggregated search system in which the three components vary in quality.",null,null
,,,
223,"The assessments for vertical-orientation were created by gathering annotations across several users. For the process of varying VS, for a given vertical Vi and query q, we consider the vertical to have a high vertical orientation if orient(Vi|W, q) is greater than 0.75 5. We simulate four different vertical selection strategies, namely Perfect, ReDDE, CORI, Bad. Perfect selects all the highly oriented verticals, while Bad randomly selects the maximum number (three) of lowly oriented verticals. ReDDE and CORI rank the verticals according to the ReDDE [21] and CORI [7] resource selection approaches, and select the top K ranked verticals.",null,null
,,,
224,"5We select the threshold as 0.75 as 75% assessors majority preference is a suitable percentage whereby the assessments are neither too noisy (50%) or stringent (100%). Furthermore, it creates a vertical intent distribution across the topics that realistically conforms to the real-world [4].",null,null
,,,
225,"For IS we simulate three potentially different levels of relevance. These are Perfect, BM25, and TF. Perfect selects all items in the vertical that are topically relevant. BM25 and TF select the top three ranked items from the rankings provided by the BM25 and a simple TF (term frequency) weighting respectively, with the PageRank score as a prior for both BM25 and TF.",null,null
,,,
226,"For RP, we simulate three different result presentation approaches: Perfect, Random and Bad. Perfect places the vertical blocks on the page so that gain could potentially be maximised, i.e. all the relevant items are placed before nonrelevant items. However, if these items are part of a vertical, we position the highest orientated vertical first. Random randomly disperses the vertical blocks on the page while maintaining the position of the ""general web"" blocks. Bad reverses the perfectly presented page.",null,null
,,,
227,"By varying the quality of each of the three key components, we can vary the quality of the result pages created by an aggregated search system in a more controlled way. For each topic, we can create 36 (4 × 3 × 3) pages6. In addition, the snippet of each item is automatically generated by the Lemur Toolkit and the presentation style conforms with typical search page presentation (presenting the vertical name in front of vertical results). Using this approach we can create a near ideal aggregated page for a query by using Perfect VS, Perfect IS, and Perfect RP. This is a greedy approach to the problem and is used as our method of normalisation for nU til.",null,null
,,,
228,5.3 Constructing and Selecting Page Pairs,null,null
,,,
229,"We now describe the selection of page pairs so that they can be presented to a user for judgment. One way to achieve this is to randomly sample two aggregated search pages, and collect a sufficient set of user preference judgments. However, following [3], we attempt a broad categorisation of the aggregated search pages into ""bins"" according to page quality, i.e. H (High), M (Middle) and L (Low). We can then provide a more in depth analysis of the performance of the metrics over different regions of the page space.",null,null

233,"the components that created the page. We estimate this by assuming that the three components contribute equal importance to the quality of the page. We then evaluate each component respectively using a suitable metric. The quality score of the page is determined by linearly combining the metric score for each component. This is a coarse approach of determining the quality of the page. We use the F-measure (VS), Mean Precision (IS), and Kendall-tau correlation (RP). We then rank all the pages according to the three linearly combined metrics and evenly categorise the pages in the ranking into ""H"", ""M"" and ""L"" bin respectively.",null,null
,,,
234,"We now have a method of comprehensively analysing how various metrics perform over the whole page space by selecting pages from these pre-assigned bins. Specifically, we have six bin pairs, H-H, H-M, H-L, M-M, M-L, L-L, which uniformly represent all the entire page space for the queries (albeit in coarse intervals). For each pair of bins, we randomly select 8 page pairs from it. Consequently, we select in total 48 (6 × 8) page pairs for each topic.",null,null
,,,
235,5.4 Collecting Pairwise Preference Assessments,null,null
,,,
236,"Our preference assessment data is collected over the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing platform, where each worker was compensated $0.01 for each assessment made. A page pair was presented with the topic (title and description) shown in the upper position of the assessment page. This was followed by a pair of aggregated pages shown sideby-side. The assessor was provided with three options when making the assessments: ""left page is better"", ""right page is better"" and ""both are bad"". The latter option captures the scenario where a user is confused due to the poor page quality7. For each page pair, we collect four assessments (from four different assessors). The total number of assessments made during this preference collection process was 10752 (56 × 48 × 4). Following [19], a quality control was ensured by including 500 ""trap"" HITs. Each ""trap"" HIT consists of a triplet (q, i, j) where either page i or j was taken from a query other than q. We interpreted an assessor preferring the set of extraneous results as evidence of malicious or careless assessments and assessors who failed more than two trap HITs were discarded.",null,null
,,,
237,5.5 Analysis of Assessments,null,null
,,,
238,"Of the 203 assessors who contributed HITs, 39 had their assessments removed from the assessment pool due to failing more than 2 trap HITs. For the remaining 164/203, participation followed a power law distribution where about 12% (20/164) of the assessors completed about 60% (6522/10752) of our HITs. We also found out that assessors rarely select the ""both are bad"" options provided as only 7% (684/10752) of the assessments are of this option.",null,null
,,,
239,"We want to answer the following question: RQ1 Do users agree with each other when assessing aggregated search pairs? Therefore, we measured annotator agreement of preferences of aggregated page pairs using Fleiss' Kappa [24] (denoted by KF ), which corrects for agreement due to chance. Fleiss' Kappa is convenient because it ignores the identity of the assessor-pair, and is designed to measure agreement over instances labeled by different (even disjoint) sets of assessors. The results are shown in Table 5.",null,null

250,"We observe that assessor agreement on presentation-pairs was KF ,"" 0.241, which is considered fair agreement [24]. This result is similar to previous research [3, 26], which reaffirm that evaluating aggregated search is not an easy task, and that various users have their own assumptions about what a good page is. Of all 10752 aggregated page-pairs, 8051 (74.8%) had a majority preference of at least 3/4 and only 2231 (20.7%) had a perfect 4/4 majority preference. It is perhaps not surprising that assessor agreement is not high as agreement on page-pairs requires that assessors make similar assumptions about the cost of different types of errors. Furthermore, the low inter-assessor agreement may be explained by the fact that users make different assumptions regarding the importance of each aggregated search component (VS, IS, RP). Alternatively, it may be that assessors have a hard time distinguishing between good presentations. Following previous research [3], given this low level of inter-assessor agreement, rather than focusing on the metrics agreement with each individual preference, we focus on their agreement with the majority preference (3/4 or greater, and 4/4) in the evaluation.""",null,null

We select the latter as they are the most prevalent user-oriented IR metrics.

A two-tailed t-test (significant at the p < 0.01 level, denoted by or ) is used to show which metric correlates more significantly with the user preferences9.",null,null

259,6.1 Standard Parameter Settings,null,null

260,"To answer RQ2, we carry out a set of experiments where we employ the prevalent standard parameter settings for the metrics used in IR experiments. We utilise the standard log discount function for all DCG related metrics (ASDCG, nDCG, -nDCG, D-nDCG and D#-nDCG). We set the  parameter in -nDCG to 0.5 and  to 0.5 for D#-nDCG. For our proposed metrics, we set  , 10 (a linearly increasing vertical-orientation function) and i ,"" 0.0 (no personalised vertical diversity preference) as the standard parameters. For the user persistence parameter in ASRBP , we set  "", 0.8 as this value best correlates with the user browsing behavior from a real-world query-log data [16]. These standard settings instantiate a simple metric (e.g. ASDCG) similar to existing topical diversity-aware metrics that incorporate subtopic importance probability (D-nDCG). The standard  of ASAT T is obtained by exploring the optimal setting in a development set that contained 500 preference page pairs that contain visually attractive results (results coming from Image and Video).",null,null
,,,
261,"Our evaluation, the fidelity of the metrics, thus focuses on the agreement (of each metric) with the user preferences over the set of aggregated search results. As we have already categorised page pairs into various quality ""bins"" (H-H, HM, H-L, M-M, M-L, L-L), we report the experimental results over different bin pairs, in order to understand each metric performance over the whole evaluation space. Our experiments have two parts: (i) when fixing the assumed user browsing model (e.g. DCG), we compare the performance of our proposed metrics with existing IR metrics; (ii) under the proposed framework, we compare user models to investigate which ones make more accurate prediction of the user preferences on aggregated page pairs.",null,null

263,"We present results for a majority preference of 3/4 or greater, or 4/4, in Table 6. The significance is calculated in comparison with one of the proposed metrics, ASDCG. Our metrics have higher agreement with user preferences for the H-M, H-L and M-L bins compared to the less discriminative bins (H-H, M-M, or L-L). In addition, for page pairs with higher majority user agreement (4/4 instead of 3/4), our metrics tend to make more accurate prediction of the user preferences. After closer examination, we observe that the metrics agreement with the majority user preference is higher on pairs where there is greater consensus between assessors. This is similar to reported in [3].",null,null

264,We also observe that overall the proposed aggregated search metrics (ASDCG) work better than existing IR metrics (nDCG,null,null

266,"and P @10). They have a significantly better performance across almost the entire metric space. This is not surprising given that the proposed metrics incorporate aspects unique to aggregated search (vertical-orientation), which can affect user preferences. Indeed, when the page quality is expected to be high, traditional IR metrics that do not consider vertical-orientation perform worse than the proposed metrics. But it is worth noting that nDCG performs significantly better than other metrics on L-L page pairs. This might be because as the returned verticals are of low orientation, and for these types of page pairs, simply measuring topical relevance of items might correlate more with the user browsing behavior than considering the additional vertical orientation; when assessing two low-quality pages, the user is trying to find more topically relevant items, without regard to the orientation of the vertical.",null,null
,,,
267,"For the diversity-aware metric, -nDCG performs significantly worse than the proposed metrics. This is because nDCG implicitly penalises the within vertical redundancy of items. This evaluation strategy is not appropriate when presenting results from the same vertical in a block. A close examination shows that this degraded performance is due to the over-penalisation for items within each vertical. Although recent research [14] has suggested that  may be tuned on a per query basis to either promote or discount extra items from the same sub-topic (vertical), we leave this for future work. In addition, instead of fully utilising the graded orient(V |W, q) information, -nDCG treats relevant verticals in a binary sense, another reason that may cause the degraded performance.",null,null
,,,
268,"The other existing diversity-aware metric D-nDCG performs comparably well. This is not surprising as when employed with standard parameter setting, D-nDCG is most similar to the proposed aggregated search metrics (ASDCG). The major difference is that ASDCG captures the effort of examining result snippets of different types. D#-nDCG performs significantly worse than D-nDCG over the entire simulated page space used for evaluation in the context of aggregated search. This proves that simply promoting vertical diversity without considering vertical-orientation can degrade the evaluation performance. In addition, as we will see later, because of the various users vertical diversity preference, personalised vertical diversity can be a better strategy for the evaluation of aggregated search. Finally, IA-nDCG also performs considerably worse than ASDCG. A close examination suggests that this is due to the over-rewarding of the vertical results in a page.",null,null
,,,
269,"When we assume a uniform effort distribution of the resulting snippets, which can be of various types, the metric performances decrease from 67.3% to 65.6%.

,,,
329,"We further see that comparatively ASERR performs better on H-M and H-L bins and worse on others. The degraded performance might be due to the fact that only binary topical-relevance assessments (of items) are available and the metric largely rewards the top relevant results. This also partly explains why ASERR performs particularly well between high quality pages (highly oriented and relevant results are presented at the top of the page) and low quality pages. It is most likely that instead of considering the entire page, most assessors looked only at the early results of the page when assessing.",null,null
,,,
330,"However, surprisingly, by incorporating attention bias (of visually attractive vertical results) into the position-based model, the performance of the metric ASAT T degrades, compared with ASDCG. This might be due to the inaccurate estimation of the attention bias  from our small-scale experiments. After closer examination, it may be that assessors have a considerable preference bias on pages that contain visually attractive results (image, video) [3]. Therefore, the preference assessment between pages containing image and video verticals may be noisier, which could result in a natural bias for those types. Further experiments are needed to explain and understand this bias and its effect.",null,null

,,,
356,"We can improve the performance of our metrics by learning suitable parameter settings using training data, thus addressing the research question RQ3. We only use ASRBP as an example. We recall that ASRBP has three parameters:  that controls the degree to which vertical orientation is rewarded;  that controls the user browsing behavior in terms of user persistence; and i that controls the degree to which a user prefers a diverse aggregated page.",null,null
,,,
357,"Training is done in two stages. First, we learn suitable values for  and  independently of i. We categorised the user preference data into five sets and use five-fold cross validation for training and testing. We set i , 0.0 (users do not prefer vertical-based diverse results unless the vertical provides better results) and iterate through different settings of values:  (from 1 to 100) and  (from 0.5 to 1.0). The optimal combination is obtained with  , 7.0 and  ,"" 0.85 indicating that users generally favour results that contain highly-oriented verticals, and that users do not have a persistent browsing behaviour (they care more about the results returned in a high position in the page). The corresponding results are shown in Table 8. The performance of the metric is improved over the standard parameter settings from 67.7% to 72.6%. This improvement is due to the better estimation of two parameters  and  concerned with two main aspects of aggregated search, vertical selection and result presentation. By learning from historical data, ASRBP (and other metrics) can better capture these two aspects. Second, we fix the optimal settings for  and  and learn personalised""",null,null

,,,
366,"As we need sufficient data for learning the parameter, we only test this over the top twenty ""head"" assessors who made most of the assessments. Like with previous setting, for each assessor, we separate assessor data into five sets and use five-fold cross validation to train and test. For the overall performance, we average the performance for all those assessors. The results are also shown in Table 8. The optimal setting for i varies from 0.15 to 0.4 among different assessors whereas the average optimal setting for those assessors is 0.23. Similar to [26], this demonstrates that each user has his/her own understanding and preference over the diversity of the results. We can report that by using this personalised parameter, the prediction of the metric agreement with the majority of user preference is improved significantly, from 72.6% to 75.9%. This effectively illustrates that aggregated search can be improved if we have a better understanding of each user preference over the diversity of results. This is particularly useful for systems that can gather personalised interaction data for their users.",null,null

367,7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK,null,null
,,,
368,"We introduced a general evaluation framework that captures several traits unique to aggregated search. We instantiated a suite of metrics for evaluating aggregated search pages from this framework. We presented a methodology to collect user preferences over aggregated pages, which allowed us to measure various aspects of our proposed metrics. We did this by simulating aggregated search pages of different quality for a range of topics. The approach allowed us to analyse different parts of the aggregated page pair space. Furthermore, we showed that the proposed metrics correlate well with the majority user preferences and that traditional IR metrics are not well suited to the task. In addition, while some diversity-based metrics can be adapted to measure the preference between page pair, they are not ideal. By instantiating several non-tuned versions of metrics from our framework, we showed that these metrics are at least comparable to diversity-based IR metrics. We also showed that our metrics have the ability to tune their behaviour for pages for which personalised preference data is available.",null,null
,,,
369,"Future work will involve extending and setting several parameters of the metrics so that they more closely correlate with user preferences for the sets of page pairs. In particular, when query-log data is available, we can further extend the framework by proposing new user browsing models for aggregated search and investigate their values. We will also devise new approaches to utilise the available implicit user feedback data to better estimate the parameters. Another interesting challenge will be to compare the effectiveness and weakness of existing diversity-aware metrics for evaluating aggregated search, and study the ability of our framework",null,null
