21,"Most queries in web search are ambiguous and multifaceted. Identifying the major senses and facets of queries from search log data, referred to as query subtopic mining in this paper, is a very important issue in web search. Through search log analysis, we show that there are two interesting phenomena of user behavior that can be leveraged to identify query subtopics, referred to as `one subtopic per search' and `subtopic clarification by keyword'. One subtopic per search means that if a user clicks multiple URLs in one query, then the clicked URLs tend to represent the same sense or facet. Subtopic clarification by keyword means that users often add an additional keyword or keywords to expand the query in order to clarify their search intent. Thus, the keywords tend to be indicative of the sense or facet. We propose a clustering algorithm that can effectively leverage the two phenomena to automatically mine the major subtopics of queries, where each subtopic is represented by a cluster containing a number of URLs and keywords. The mined subtopics of queries can be used in multiple tasks in web search and we evaluate them in aspects of the search result presentation such as clustering and re-ranking. We demonstrate that our clustering algorithm can effectively mine query subtopics with an F1 measure in the range of 0.896-0.956. Our experimental results show that the use of the subtopics mined by our approach can significantly improve the state-of-the-art methods used for search result clustering. Experimental results based on click data also show that the re-ranking of search result based on our method can significantly improve the efficiency of users' ability to find information.",null,null

30,"Understanding the search intent of users is essential for satisfying a user's search needs. How to best represent query intent is still an ongoing research problem. One consensus among the researchers is that the intents of queries can be characterized along multiple dimensions. The intents of a query can be represented by its search goals, such as informational, navigational, and transactional [7]. It can also be represented by semantic categories or topics [8, 23, 24]. Furthermore, it can be represented by subtopics (cf., [14]), denoting multiple senses or multiple facets of the query.",null,null
,,,
31,"Most queries are ambiguous or multifaceted [14]. For example, `harry shum' is an ambiguous query, which may refer to an American actor, a vice president of Microsoft, or another person named Harry Shum. `Xbox' is a multifaceted query. When people search for `xbox', they may be looking for information on different facets of an Xbox, such as `online game', `homepage', and `marketplace'. Note that a query can be both ambiguous and multifaceted. The more frequent a query is, the more likely that it has multiple senses or facets. The major difference between the topics and subtopics of a query is that the former is more coarsegrained and related to other queries, while the latter is finegrained and is only about the query in question.",null,null
,,,
32,"Identifying the major subtopics of a query is very important for many search tasks such as personalized search, query suggestion, and search result presentation including clustering, re-ranking, and diversification. In this paper, we aim to automatically mine the major subtopics (senses and facets) of queries from the search log data. Although there is some related work, the subtopic mining problem as defined in this paper does not seem to have been studied previously.",null,null
,,,
33,"We performed a comprehensive study of the two phenomena, referred to as `one subtopic per search' (OSS) and `subtopic clarification by additional keyword' (SCAK) respectively. We show that we can mine the subtopics of queries from search log data by effectively using the phenomena. We then represent the senses or facets of a query",null,null

,,,
36,"If a user clicks multiple URLs after submitting a query (the multiple URLs are also referred to as multi-clicks in this paper), then the clicked URLs tend to represent the same subtopic, which is called one subtopic per search (OSS). Figure 1 shows an example of search results for the query `harry shum' on a web search engine. The result contains URLs about two Harry Shum's. The search log data indicates that URLs 1, 3, and 5 are usually clicked together in individual searches, and URLs 2 and 4 are clicked together. Each group of URLs actually corresponds to one sense, i.e., one subtopic. Gale and Church discovered a similar phenomenon in natural language texts, called `one sense per discourse' [19], which means an ambiguous word usually only has one sense in a specific context. Users often add ad-",null,null

38,"ditional keywords (in most cases, one additional keyword) to a query to expand the query in order to clarify its subtopic. This phenomenon is called subtopic clarification by additional keyword (SCAK). As a result, the URLs clicked after searching both with the original and the expanded queries tend to represent the same subtopic and the keyword also tends to be indicative of the subtopic. For example, people may submit `harry shum microsoft' as an expanded query to specify the subtopic. The URLs clicked in searches for both `harry shum' and `harry shum microsoft' usually represent the same subtopic, Harry Shum from Microsoft, and therefore `microsoft' becomes a keyword of the subtopic.",null,null
,,,
39,"We employ a clustering algorithm to group URLs as well as keywords into clusters, where each cluster represents one subtopic of a query. For example, one cluster for query `harry shum' may contain the home page of the Microsoft Harry Shum, his wiki profile, and the keywords `microsoft' and `bing'. The clustering is performed based on the two phenomena of user behavior, as described above. Specifically, for each query and its expanded queries (the original query plus keywords), the related click log data is collected. Clustering is then carried out on all the clicked URLs. If two URLs are clicked together many times in the click data, then they are likely to be clustered together. If two URLs are clicked both under the original and expanded queries, then they are likely to be clustered together. We employ a special data structure consisting of a prefix tree and a suffix",null,null

40,"tree to facilitate recursive execution of the clustering algorithm on the log data. In this way, the mining of subtopics can be conducted very efficiently.",null,null
,,,
41,"We conducted experiments to measure the accuracy of our clustering method on a TREC data set and a new data set in which the subtopics of both queries are labeled. For ambiguous subtopics, our method can achieve a B-cubed F1 from 0.925 to 0.956. For multifaceted subtopics, our method can achieve a B-cubed F1 from 0.896 to 0.930 in terms of B-cubed F1. The results indicate that our method can effectively perform query subtopic mining.",null,null
,,,
42,"We also evaluated our method in search result clustering. We compared our method with a state-of-the-art method of search result clustering. Experimental results show that our method can significantly improve accuracy. The improvements are 5.4% in terms of B-cubed precision and 6.1% in terms of B-cubed recall. When compared side-by-side with human generated results, we also find that our method is significantly better than the baseline.",null,null
,,,
43,"We further evaluated our method on search result reranking, in which the user is confirmed with the subtopic she has in mind and re-ranking of search results based on user feedback is performed. We used the average click position in the log data as the evaluation measure. The results show that our method can boost the average click position 0.61 points higher, which implies a promising improvement in the user experience.",null,null
,,,
44,There are three major contributions in our work: 1. We have analyzed two phenomena in user search behavior that can be utilized to identify query subtopics. 2. We have developed a clustering method that can effectively and efficiently mine the subtopics on the basis of the phenomena and use them to represent query subtopics. 3. We have successfully applied the mined results to two tasks: search result clustering and re-ranking. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces related work. Section 3 describes the detailed analysis of user behavior in the log data for subtopic mining. Section 4 explains our approach to subtopic mining and Section 5 presents the experimental results. Section 6 presents two applications of our subtopic mining algorithm. Section 7 concludes the paper.,null,null

47,"The intent of a query can be characterized along several dimensions, including search goals [7], semantic classes [5], topics [4], and subtopics [14]. The search goals can be informational, navigational, or transactional. The semantic classes of a query can be represented by ODP categories1. The topics or subtopics of a query can be represented by a number of queries or URLs. Topics are usually more coarse-grained and can cover multiple queries, while subtopics are more fine-grained and associated with a specific query [14]. For example, for the query `xbox', all aspects related to Xbox including online game, market place, and even other game consoles are usually included in the topic of the query. In contrast, each aspect of Xbox is represented by one subtopic of the query.",null,null

Methods for performing the task have been proposed (e.g., [4, 10, 15, 18, 21, 25, 27]). Beeferman et al. [4], for example, proposed conducting clustering on a click-through bipartite graph and viewing the obtained clusters as topics covering multiple queries. Radlinski et al. [25] proposed first using search session data to find similar queries, and then using a click-through bipartite graph to refine the discovered queries that are similar, and finally grouping the similar queries into the same clusters. The clusters containing the same query are then regarded as topics of the query.",null,null
,,,
52,"There are some similarities but also significant differences between our work and Radlinski et al.'s work. 1) The problem settings are different. In their work, a subtopic is represented by multiple queries, while in our work a subtopic is represented by keywords and URLs. 2) The information used for subtopic mining is different. They used search sessions to find frequently co-occurring query pairs, considered them candidates of similar query pairs, and finally used a click-through bipartite graph to filter unlikely queries. 3) The goals are also different. The mined results in their work were utilized for manual creation of TREC data. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluated our method on two search tasks, namely search result clustering and re-ranking.",null,null

53,"Methods for utilizing a user's click behavior in individual searches have been developed, e.g., [12, 15]. Existing work aimed at modeling and predicting a user's click behavior while our work attempts to find the subtopics of queries. The exploitation of the prefix and suffix relationship between queries was also considered in the previous work, e.g., [26]. In our work, we not only use the prefix and suffix relationship between queries, but also the clicked URLs of the queries and our goal is to conduct query subtopic mining.",null,null

56,"Search result clustering attempts to cluster the search results according to semantic classes, topics, or subtopics [11]. For example, Chen and Dumais [13] proposed using text classification technologies to classify search results into predefined categories. Zeng proposed using text clustering techniques to cluster a research result based on the titles and snippets of web pages [29]. See also [2, 16, 17]. The major characteristic of these methods is that they use the content of documents in search result clustering.",null,null

We conducted analysis on the phenomenon with a search log data set from a commercial web search engine (DataSetA as described in Table 8) and validated the correctness of this hypothesis. Our explanation of the phenomenon is: 1) Search users are rational and they do not randomly click on search results (cf., [1, 20]). 2) Users usually have one single subtopic in mind for a particular search.",null,null
,,,
74,"Table 1 shows two groups of multi-clicked URLs (i.e., the multiple URLs clicked by a user in a query) from search logs for the query `harry shum'. The three URLs in the first group are about one sense and the two URLs in the second group are about another sense. Users may accidently click URLs belonging to two different groups, but such cases are rare. This is reasonable, because if a user searches for a specific person then she usually would only click the URLs about the person and skip the URLs about other people. We call such user behavior `one subtopic per search'. We examined the accuracy of using one subtopic per search as a rule for subtopic identification. By accuracy we mean the percentage of the multi-clicks that share the same subtopics among all multi-clicks. We sampled 10,000 groups of multiclicks of individual queries in DataSetA, which are labeled based on the sense or facet. When all the URLs within the multi-clicks are about the same sense or facet, we consider that the rule has correctly identified a subtopic. Table 2 shows the accuracy versus the number of multi-clicks. We can see that the average accuracy of one subtopic per search is about 84%, suggesting that it is very helpful for identifying the subtopics of queries. Table 2 also shows that the accu-",null,null

For example, `beijing' and `beijing duck', `fast' and `fast food', and `computer science' and `computer science department' do not have URL overlap, and they do not have subtopic overlap either.

168,"We employ a clustering method to mine subtopics of queries leveraging the two phenomena and search log data. The flow of the method is shown in Figure 5. In the preprocessing stage, we build an index to store all the queries and their clicked URLs. False expanded queries are then pruned from the index. In the clustering stage, the URLs associated with a query and its expanded queries are grouped into clusters, each representing one subtopic. In the post-processing stage, keywords are assigned to the clusters (subtopics) to enrich the representations of subtopics.",null,null

In the suffix tree query `Q' and its expanded queries `W+Q' are indexed as a father node and child nodes respectively. Figure 6 illustrates the data structure. For query `harry shum', we can easily find its expanded queries `Q+W' from the prefix tree, such as `harry shum jr', `harry shum glee', and `harry shum bing'.

The remaining two datasets consist of queries and URLs randomly sampled from the logs of the commercial search engine in the EN-US market from June 1st, 2010 to March 31st 2011.

453,"When analyzing the results, we found the clusters generated by our approach are more accurate and natural (easy to understand) than the clusters generated by the baseline. This indicates that the clustering of URLs from a user's perspective (log mining based) can achieve better results than from a content creator's perspective (content based).",null,null
,,,
454,"Our approach outperforms the baseline approach in terms of F1 measure for ambiguous, multifaceted, and mixed queries. The improvements of our approach on recall are larger than the improvements on precision. This is because our approach starts from the mined subtopics that cover the main subtopics of queries. On the contrary, the baseline has no such information, and it tends to generate larger clusters.",null,null
,,,
455,"The improvement of our method over the baseline on the TREC data is not as high as those on DataSetA. Because in the TREC data, each subtopic consists of about 26.7 URLs while in DataSetA each subtopic only consists of about 6.8 URLs. In other words, DataSetA has finer grained subtopics than the TREC data. When the granularity of subtopics is coarser, our method can benefit less from log mining.",Y,null

456,"Here we show three examples of results given by the two methods. For simplicity, we only show the labels (subtopics) of URLs in each cluster. The first example is an ambiguous query, the second is a multifaceted query, and the third is",null,null

486,6.2 Search Result Re-Ranking,null,null
,,,
487,"We consider another search task for the evaluation of our subtopic mining method, namely, search result re-ranking. We chose to do so because we can easily use click-through data to conduct quantitative evaluation.",null,null
,,,
488,6.2.1 Our Method,null,null
,,,
489,"When the search system provides the results to the user, there might be multiple ways to present it if the query contains multiple subtopics, i.e., it is ambiguous or multifaceted. These include simple ranking, clustering of URLs by subtopics, dynamic ranking of URLs belonging to the same topic, as well as re-ranking of URLs by subtopics.",null,null
,,,
490,"Re-ranking is conducted in the following way. The user is first asked which subtopic she is interested in, with the subtopics shown at the top of the results page. When the user selects a subtopic, the URLs belonging to the subtopic will be moved to the top (re-ranked). The relative order between URLs inside and outside of the subtopic will be kept. The subtopics are assumed to be represented by keywords of subtopics mined with our method.",null,null
,,,
491,"Figure 8 shows an example UI in which re-ranking is performed for the query `harry shum.' The second subtopic of the query is selected and all the URLs belonging to it are re-ranked at the top. This will significantly improve a user's experience compared with the conventional approach (Figure 1). Although re-ranking is a simple, interactive approach to search results presentation (cf., [28]), there seems to be no study before on the approach to the best of our knowledge. Note that re-ranking can only be done for head queries, because it is based on log data mining, which is a shortcoming that any data mining method may suffer from.",null,null

492,6.2.2 Evaluation,null,null
,,,
493,"We collected search log data of 20, 000 randomly selected searches at the commercial search engine, for which the query has at least two subtopics mined by our method. The search log data contains the ranking results of URLs as well as the clicks on URLs in the searches. We used the data to estimate how much the cost of users' searches can be saved by re-ranking based on our subtopic mining method.",null,null

496,"We first calculated the average position of last clicked URLs in the 20, 000 searches. The result is 3.41. The number indicates the average cost of finding information in the conventional search UI based on ranking.",null,null
,,,
497,"Next, we used the same log data to estimate the cost for users based on re-ranking. We assumed that the cost for the user to check the subtopics and click one of them is 1.0, because the subtopics are shown in one line at the top, and examining them is almost equivalent to examining the title and snippet of a URL. The cost of finding the last click within each selected subtopic can be calculated by using the search log data, because within the subtopic the ranking order is preserved. Note that because of the one subtopic per search phenomenon, the clicked URLs in a search usually belong to the same subtopic. We calculated the average position of last clicked URLs belonging to the same subtopics in the 20, 000 searches and found that it is 1.80.",null,null

500,"This is the result for the saved cost per search. Similarly, we can estimate the saved cost per query, which is 0.7. We can conclude, therefore, that the re-ranking method can reduce a user's effort in finding information, and thus our method of subtopic mining is effective.",null,null

,,,
502,"In this paper, we have studied the problem of query subtopic mining. Specifically, we have discovered two phenomena of user search behavior that can be used as signals to mine major senses and facets of ambiguous and multifaceted queries. One is called one subtopic per search and the other subtopic clarification by additional keyword. We have developed a clustering algorithm that can effectively and efficiently mine query subtopics on the basis of the two phenomena. We have evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed approach. On the TREC dataset, the F1-measure is 0.925 for finding ambiguous subtopics and 0.896 for finding multifaceted subtopics. When applied to search result clustering, our method can improve precision by 5.4% and recall by 6.1%. The effectiveness of our method has also been verified in search result re-ranking, using click data.",null,null

Second, we only tried one clustering algorithm as an example. Other existing algorithms can be applied as well. Third, the mined subtopics by our method were only applied to two applications, and they can be useful in other applications as well. We also plan to try some other applications such as personalized search and search result diversification. Finally, our method can only be employed when there is enough search log data, which is also a drawback for most log mining algorithms. How to apply the approach in tail queries is also an issue we need to consider.",null,null
