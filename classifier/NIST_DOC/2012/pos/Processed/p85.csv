21,ABSTRACT,null,null
22,"A diversified search result for an underspecified query generally contains web pages in which there are answers that are relevant to different aspects of the query. In order to help the user locate such relevant answers, we propose a simple extension to the standard Search Engine Result Page (SERP) interface, called AspecTiles. In addition to presenting a ranked list of URLs with their titles and snippets, AspecTiles visualizes the relevance degree of a document to each aspect by means of colored squares (""tiles""). To compare AspecTiles with the standard SERP interface in terms of usefulness, we conducted a user study involving 30 search tasks designed based on the TREC web diversity task topics as well as 32 participants. Our results show that AspecTiles has some advantages in terms of search performance, user behavior, and user satisfaction. First, AspecTiles enables the user to gather relevant information significantly more efficiently than the standard SERP interface for tasks where the user considers several different aspects of the query to be important at the same time (multi-aspect tasks). Second, AspecTiles affects the user's information seeking behavior: with this interface, we observed significantly fewer query reformulations, shorter queries and deeper examinations of ranked lists in multiaspect tasks. Third, participants of our user study found AspecTiles significantly more useful for finding relevant information and easy to use than the standard SERP interface. These results suggest that simple interfaces like AspecTiles can enhance the search performance and search experience of the user when their queries are underspecified.",null,null

31,1. INTRODUCTION,null,null
32,"Search queries are often ambiguous (""office"" may mean a workplace or a Microsoft product) or underspecified (""harry potter"" may mean the books, the films or the main character) [7]. Given such queries, search result diversification aims to cover different search intents of the query in a single ranked list of retrieved documents [1]. We are particularly interested in underspecified queries as every query is arguably underspecified to some extent unless it is a perfect representation of the underlying information need. One possible way to explicitly represent these different intents would be to use information types, which we refer to as aspects1. For example, desired aspects of an underspecified query ""elliptical trainer"" (a stationary exercise machine) may include product names, benefits and reviews. The present study concerns what kind of interface would be effective for presenting a diversified ranked list of results obtained in response to such a query.",null,null
33,"An underspecified query may possibly represent an information need for a specific aspect of a topic or for various aspects of a topic. For example, with the aforementioned ""elliptical trainer"" query, the user may be looking for product names of the elliptical trainer, or he may be looking for not only product names, but also benefits and reviews of elliptical trainers. Thus, we make a distinction between single-aspect tasks and multi-aspect tasks in our study. This is because the effectiveness of a search result presentation interface may depend on the variety of aspects that the user desires. Another possible viewpoint for categorizing search tasks would be the number of relevant answers the user requires (e.g. home page findings vs. recall-oriented search) [3, 17], but this study primarily concerns",null,null

37,"To help the user efficiently and effectively locate retrieved relevant answers that match the desired aspects within the Search Engine Result Page (SERP), we propose a simple extension to the standard SERP interface, which we call AspecTiles. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the AspecTiles interface. As can be seen, AspecTiles visualizes which of the ranked web pages are relevant to which aspects by means of colored squares (""tiles"") that are shown to the left of each document in the SERP. Moreover, the color represents the degree of relevance to an aspect. We believe that this line of research is important but missing in current search result diversification studies: even though most diversification systems rely on explicit identification of different search intents, a standard SERP interface does not tell the user which document is likely to be relevant to which of the intents, and to what degree. We hypothesized that a more informative interface such as AspecTiles will help web search engine users.",null,null
38,"In this study, we conduct a user study involving 30 search tasks designed based on the TREC web diversity task topics as well as 32 participants to address the following Research Questions:",null,null
39,· RQ1: Does AspecTiles enable users to gather relevant information more effectively and efficiently when compared to the standard SERP interface?,null,null
40,· RQ2: Does AspecTiles affect the user's information seeking behavior? In what way?,null,null
41,"RQ1 is the central question addressed in this paper. Compared to the standard SERP interface, AspecTiles provides the additional information of which documents are relevant to which aspects and to what degree. Thus, we expect the user to quickly scan the ranked list and locate relevant documents that match the desired aspects. Moreover, we would like to clarify under what conditions AspecTiles can be beneficial. For example, it is possible that AspecTiles may be more useful for multi-aspect tasks than for single-aspect tasks, as it can highlight the difference between a document that covers multiple aspects and one that covers only one aspect. Moreover, other factors such as the number of tiles displayed, the quality of the aspects represented as tiles and the accuracy of the estimated degree of relevance represented by the tile color may affect the outcome.",null,null
42,"While RQ1 concerns user performance, RQ2 concerns user behavior. For example, we can hypothesize that, if the displayed aspects match well with the user's desired aspects, then the user can locate desired information without reformulating his query many times. Another possible hypothesis would be that, since AspecTiles enables the user to skip documents that are seemingly irrelevant to the desired aspects while scanning the ranked list, it may guide the user to documents that lie deeper in the ranked list.",null,null

44,2. RELATED WORK,null,null
45,"Information visualization takes advantage of the user's visual information processing abilities by generating graphical representations of data or concepts for presenting textual information [21], and is known to be useful for quantitative comparisons [15]. Thus, many search result visualization methods have been proposed to provide the user with a quick overview of the retrieved documents.",null,null
46,"According to Turetken and Sharda [20], web documents can be visualized based on content (e.g., title and term frequency) [4, 9, 10, 14, 16, 23], connectivity (e.g., number of incoming and outgoing links), and others (e.g., metadata like document size and the web domain) [4, 10]. Our AspecTiles falls into the first category, as it visualizes the relevance of each retrieved web page with respect to each displayed aspect.",null,null
47,"The TileBar interface proposed by Hearst [9] and the simpler HotMap interface proposed by Hoeber and Yang [14] are visually somewhat similar to AspecTiles. In TileBar, each retrieved document is represented by a rectangle, where the query terms are arranged vertically and the document length is represented horizontally. For each query term, its term frequency within each section of a document is represented in grayscale. In HotMap, a row of squares are shown to the left of each retrieved document, where each square represents a particular query term and its withindocument term frequency. The user experiments by Hoeber and Yang suggested that HotMap is useful for effective and efficient information gathering. Our AspecTiles is different from TileBar and HotMap in that (a) the row of squares (which we call tiles2) represent possible aspects or intents of the query rather than the individual query terms of that query; and (b) the color of each tile represents the degree of relevance of the document to that particular aspect rather than term frequency. Thus, AspecTiles requires the backend search engine to provide a set of possible aspects given a query, and estimated per-aspect relevance scores. To our knowledge, our work is the first to study this kind of interface for the purpose of presenting diversified search results.",null,null
48,"There are other ways to visualize search engine results, such as glyph-based and graph-based methods. Glyph-based approaches include the work by Heimonen and Jhaveri [10] who used documentshaped icons, and the work by Chau [4] who used a flower metaphor for representing statistics such as term frequency and document length. Graph-based approaches include bar charts of Reiterer et al. [16], and the radar charts of Yamamoto and Tanaka [23]. The radar charts were used for visualizing a fixed set of credibility criteria (accuracy, objectivity, authority, currency, and coverage). None of these studies was to do with multiple intents/aspects and search result diversification.",null,null
49,"Brandt et al. [2] describe a method for dynamically presenting diversified search results. The main idea is to present a tree of web pages and dynamically recomputing it based on the nodes expanded by the user instead of showing a flat static list. While this rich presentation approach may have benefits, it is radically different from the standard SERP, and may be difficult to prevail. Moreover, its usability (e.g. the cognitive load of making the user backtrack within a tree, that of rearranging documents that the user has seen or has yet to see, etc.) is unknown. In contrast, AspecTiles lets the user go through a list just like traditional SERP, and is arguably easier for existing web search engines to adopt.",null,null
50,"Our choice of using simple tiles (i.e. colored squares) for representing per-aspect relevance of retrieved documents is based on findings from previous research in user interface studies including the aforementioned ones. In particular, the user evaluation of HotMap [14] suggested that the simple interface offers effective and efficient information access as well as high user satisfaction. While HotMap users may quickly skip documents that are nonrelevant to the query and locate relevant documents with high query term frequencies, AspecTiles users may quickly skip documents that are nonrelevant to the desired aspects of the query and even locate relevant documents that cover multiple desired aspects.

56,"Regarding the underlying search engine that SERP interfaces require, a number of effective search result diversification algorithms have been proposed recently [1, 8, 18]. Any of these algorithms could be used with our AspecTiles presentation interface, provided that an explicit set of aspects of the given query and per-aspect relevance scores for each retrieved document are available. In this study, we use as input the diversified web search system described by Dou et al. [8]. This system was a top performer in the Japanese Document Ranking (search result diversification) subtask of the recent NTCIR-9 INTENT task [19].",null,null
57,3. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN,null,null
58,This section describes a user study that we designed to address the research questions mentioned in Section 1: Is AspecTiles more effective and efficient than the standard SERP? How does it affect the user's search behavior?,null,null
59,3.1 Interfaces,null,null
60,"We compared three prototype interfaces in our user experiments: AspecTiles with five tiles, AspecTiles with three tiles and a baseline interface with no tiles. The number of tiles refers to the initial setting ­ participants were allowed to change the number of displayed tiles during their search tasks, as we shall explain later. We initially displayed either five or three tiles because (a) too many tiles would mean a wide left margin for the SERP and therefore waste of space; and (b) showing too much information may have adverse effects on the user performance and satisfaction. Note, for example, that current web search engines typically show no more than eight query suggestions at a time.",null,null
61,"Figures 1, 2 and 3 show screenshots of our three interfaces for the query ""elliptical trainer."" All interfaces show the title, snippet and URL of each ranked document. In addition, the two AspecTiles interfaces show (a) aspect labels (e.g. ""reviews"", ""best machines"",",null,null
62,"exercise etc.) at the top of SERP; (b) a colored tile for each displayed aspect, whose color represents the per-aspect relevance of the document in five-point scale (dark blue means highly relevant and light blue means marginally relevant); and (c) a popup text when the mouse is placed over a tile, which reminds the user of the aspect label. In addition, the user can freely adjust the number of displayed aspects to any number between zero and eight during the experiment, by clicking the Add or the Remove button. For example, if a user of the three-tile AspecTiles interface finds that none of the displayed aspects is useful, he may choose to click Add to show more aspects, some of which may turn out be relevant to his needs. Whereas, the baseline interface is very similar to popular search engines such as Google and Bing.",null,null
63,"The three experimental interfaces share the same underlying diversification algorithm. When a query is issued, its top 300 search results and query suggestions are obtained using Bing API3. In our study, we treated these query suggestions as the aspects to be displayed on the interface, as they are easy to obtain, reasonably accurate and were effective for search result diversification with Dou et al.'s algorithm [8] at the NTCIR-9 INTENT task [19]. To save space, the aforementioned aspect labels were obtained after removing all query terms from each query suggestion; whereas, the original query suggestion string was shown in the popup text (e.g. ""reviews"" for the former and ""elliptical trainer reviews"" for the latter). A more sophisticated method that is dedicated to finding accurate aspects (information types) for AspecTiles deserves to be explored, but this is beyond the scope of our study: we focus on the usefulness of AspecTiles in a realistic situation where the displayed aspects do not perfectly overlap with the desired aspects.",null,null
64,"Using the aspects thus obtained, we used the algorithm by Dou et al. to compute per-aspect relevance scores and to rerank the SERP obtained by Bing API. Our future plan includes letting the user click the tiles (as well as the aspect labels) on the AspecTiles interface and thereby dynamically rerank documents, but this is beyond the scope of the present study. Our current focus is to examine the effect of showing the tiles to the user rather than that of interacting with the tiles as well as with the aspect labels (query suggestions).",null,null

69,"As we hypothesized that AspecTiles may be more useful for multi-aspect tasks (e.g. Find product names, benefits and reviews of the elliptical trainer) than for single-aspect tasks (e.g. What are the benefits of an elliptical trainer?), we devised 15 multi-aspect tasks and 15 single-aspect tasks shown in Table 1. For this purpose, we carefully examined the TREC 2009 web diversity task topics and selected 15 faceted (i.e. underspecified) topics that had informational subtopics [6], so that each selected topic could be used as a resource for creating exactly one multi-aspect task and exactly one single-aspect task 4. Figure 4 shows a selected topic: it contains a query field, a description field and several informational subtopics. From this topic, we created a multi-aspect task: ""Find information about elliptical trainer machines. (reviews, benefits, product names)."" The words in parenthesis correspond to the desired aspects, i.e., the types of information that the participants are asked to collect. In this example, these desired aspects correspond to informational subtopics 1, 3 and 4: for every multi-aspect task, we selected exactly three desired aspects. When more than three informational subtopics were available, we carefully selected three desired aspects from them so that the overlap between the selected aspects and the displayed aspects (i.e. query suggestions) are neither too high nor too low. As we mentioned earlier, we wanted to examine the realistic situation where the displayed aspects are of reasonable accuracy. In fact, the average number of informational subtopics per faceted topic was 3.8, so we used up most of the informational subtopics in the faceted topics. On the other hand, from the same topic, we created one single-aspect task: ""What are the benefits of an elliptical trainer compared to other fitness machines?"" Note that this is exactly subtopic 3. In summary, we prepared 15 multi-aspect tasks that require participants to look for exactly three aspects (e.g. reviews, benefits and product names), and 15 single-aspect tasks that require them to look for exactly one aspect (e.g. benefits).",null,null

73,"We hired 32 participants for our user study. 21 of them were male and 11 were female; 24 were students in computer science; four were researchers in computer science and the other four were desk workers. The average age of the participants was 26.18 years, with a standard deviation of 4.34.",null,null
74,"Then we formed an experimental design similar to that of the TREC interactive track [13]. Each participant performed a total of six tasks (three multi-aspect and three single-aspect): two using the five-tile AspecTiles, two using the three-tile AspecTiles and the other two using the baseline. The choice and the order of systems and tasks were randomized for each participant.",null,null
75,"Prior to the actual user experiment, each participant went through a training task to become familiar with the interfaces and the tasks. Each training session took approximately ten minutes.",null,null
76,"For each of the six tasks, the participants were provided with a printed task description document that contained the initial query (e.g. ""elliptical trainer""), a short explanation of the topic (e.g. ""a stationary exercise machine""), (for multi-aspect tasks only) the three desired aspects (e.g. ""reviews,"" ""benefits"" and ""product names."") and some additional information if required. For the elliptical trainer example, the short explanation indicated that it is a kind of stationary exercise machine (description obtained from Wikipedia) and a sample picture of an elliptical trainer was shown to the participants as additional information. This is because the tasks that originate from TREC are not real information needs of the participants, and therefore the participants were not necessarily familiar with all of the tasks.",null,null
77,"In each task session, the participant used one of the aforementioned three interfaces to collect as many answers as possible within ten minutes (for single-aspect tasks) or fifteen minutes (for multiaspect tasks). An answer is a relevant instance that matches one of the desired aspects (e.g. a particular product name of elliptical trainer). When the participant clicked on a URL within the interface, a special landing page window popped up, from which he could extract arbitrary part of the HTML by a mouse drag and bookmark it. A single bookmark can contain multiple text segments from the same webpage, as well as images and links. A single relevant bookmark may contain one or multiple answers, and may even cover multiple desired aspects. For example, one bookmark may contain a product name of elliptical trainer, its review as well as its picture. Note that we used a special browsing interface to facilitate collection of answers rather than a standard web browser.",null,null

95,"sessed with radio buttons for selecting a relevance grade (""highly relevant,"" ""somewhat relevant"" or ""not relevant""). For multi-aspect tasks, if a bookmark was judged relevant, then the assessors were also asked to check on one or more of the desired aspects that the bookmark contained. The inter-assessor agreement was quite high (Fleiss' kappa: 0.666). Based on the three assessment sets, we constructed two ground-truths: strict and lenient sets. In the former, the relevance grade of each bookmark reflects the lowest relevance grade for that bookmark among the three assessors, and the matched aspects of that bookmark are obtained by taking the intersection of the three assessors' selected aspects. In the latter, the relevance grade of each bookmark reflects the highest relevance grade for that bookmark among the three assessors, and the matched aspects of that bookmark are obtained by taking the union of the three assessors' selected aspects. Thus, the strict set reflects the view: ""nothing is relevant unless all three assessors say that it is relevant"" while the lenient set reflects the view: ""anything is relevant if at least one assessor says that it is relevant.""",null,null

97,"Using the strict and lenient sets of ground truths, we compared the user effectiveness and efficiency for AspecTiles and for the baseline interface.

Then precision is n divided by the number of bookmarks found by that user for that task session, and recall is n divided by the total number of known relevant bookmarks for that task session.

Clearly, all of these statistics should be low for an ideally efficient interface. For multi-aspect tasks that require three aspects, we also compute aspect coverage, i.e. the fraction of desired aspects covered by the user's bookmarks (which can range from 0/3 to 3/3).",null,null
101,"Tables 2 and 3 show the user effectiveness and efficiency results with the strict and lenient sets, respectively. For both task types (single-aspect and multi-aspect), we conducted a two-factor (interface and task) ANOVA at p  0.05 for all types of measurements. For single-aspect tasks, only the task effect was significant for Precision, Time-FirstRel, DocClick-FirstRel, Time-TwoRel, and DocClick-TwoRel; none of the effects was significant for Recall. For multi-aspect tasks, only the task effect was significant for Precision and Aspect coverage, and only the system effect was significant for Recall, Time-FirstRel, DocClick-FirstRel, Time-TwoRel, and DocClick-TwoRel. If a significant interaction was found, we also conducted a Bonferroni post-hoc test at p  0.05 between two interfaces.

102,"In multi-aspect tasks, it can be observed that the five-tile AspecTiles demonstrated significantly higher recall than the baseline. Moreover, although not statistically significant, it can be observed that Precision and Aspect Coverage values also tend to be higher with AspecTiles. On the other hand, it can be observed that AspecTiles is significantly better than the baseline in terms of TimeFirstRel, DocClick-FirstRel, Time-TwoRel and DocClick-TwoRel. The latter two statistics in particular show that even the three-tile AspecTiles is advantageous over the baseline. Thus, we can conclude that, for multi-aspect tasks, AspecTiles lets the user collect relevant pieces of information in shorter time using fewer clicks than the baseline, while keeping the user effectiveness at least comparable. In addition, note that, for multi-aspect tasks, the measurements for five-tile AspecTiles are consistently better than those for three-tile AspecTiles.

169,"For single-aspect tasks, we cannot claim that AspecTiles is effective as there are no significant differences observed. We attribute this mainly to the fact that for single-aspect tasks, the chance of finding the desired aspect within the displayed aspects is smaller compared to multi-aspect tasks. For example, for both the singleaspect task ""What cell phone companies offer Motorola phones?"" and the multi-aspect task ""Find information about cell phones and cellular service providers. (provider names, prices, reviews),"" the initial query automatically issued by the system was ""cell phones."" As a result, in both tasks, the initially displayed aspects (obtained from query suggestions in response to ""cell phones"") were ""providers, verizon, sprint"" in three-tile AspecTiles, and additionally ""prepaid, cheap"" in five-tile AspecTiles. While the displayed aspects such as ""providers"" and ""cheap"" are probably directly useful for the multi-aspect task as it requires ""provider names"" and ""prices,"" they are probably not useful for the particular single-aspect task as ""motorola"" is not included in them. We manually counted the number of initially displayed aspects that are actually relevant to the desired aspects for all task sessions: it was 0.683 for singleaspect tasks and 1.113 for multi-aspect tasks on average.

In this study, we chose to use query suggestions for (a), and a state-of-the-art diversified web search system [8] for (b), so that we can study the advantages of AspecTiles in a practical situation. Thus, in our study, both the quality of the displayed aspects and the estimated per-aspect relevance score (shown as colors of the tiles) are far from perfect. In this section, we investigate their effects on user effectiveness.",null,null

For each issued query, let n be the number of relevant bookmarks found by a particular user for that query. Then per-query precision is n divided by the number of bookmarks found by that user for that query, per-query recall is n divided by the total number of known relevant bookmarks for that query. We also compute per-query aspect coverage, i.e. the fraction of desired aspects covered by the user's bookmarks for that query.

252,"On the other hand, to investigate the effect of relevance estimation accuracy, we computed precision, recall and (for multi-aspect tasks only) aspect coverage of the bookmarks for every clicked document. This is because the quality of estimated per-aspect relevance score for each clicked document change accordingly within the task session. For each clicked document, let n be the number of relevant bookmarks found by a particular user on that document. Then perdocument precision is n divided by the number of bookmarks found by that user within a particular document, per-document recall is n divided by the total number of known relevant bookmarks within that document. We also compute per-document aspect coverage, i.e. the fraction of desired aspects covered by the user's bookmarks within that document. For example, if two bookmarks were saved from a clicked document and only one of them was relevant, the precision for this document is 0.5. For computing these metrics, the first author of this paper manually examined all 1,483 clicked documents obtained in our experiments, and identified false alarms: a false alarm is a document-aspect pair that AspectTiles presented as relevant even though in fact the document content suggested otherwise. (Whereas, she did not check for misses: relevant documentaspect pairs which AspecTiles failed to present as relevant.)",null,null
253,"Tables 4 and 5 show the Spearman's rank correlation values between user effectiveness and the aspect quality / relevance estimation accuracy with the strict and lenient sets, respectively. Recall that the user effectiveness values were computed per query for the displayed aspect quality and per document for the relevance estimation accuracy. It can be observed that user effectiveness (precision, recall and aspect coverage) is indeed correlated with the quality of displayed aspects and with the accuracy of estimated per-aspect relevance scores. The correlation is especially high for the latter. These results suggest that AspecTiles would be even more effective if the underlying search system can provide more appropriate selection of aspects to be displayed, as well as accurate per-aspect relevance scores. Note that showing innacurate relevance scores (in the form of colors) may seriously mislead the user: if the system fails to indicate that a document is relevant from a certain aspect, the user may skip the document; conversely, if the system shows a false positive for a certain aspect, the user may be forced to visit a document that is not useful to him.",null,null

270,"Table 6 summarizes the number of query reformulations, the average query lengths (including the initial query and the queries reformulated by the participants), the average rank of clicked documents (""Rank-All""), the average rank of clicked documents that contain at least one relevant bookmark in the strict set (""Rank-Rel (strict)""), and the average rank of clicked documents that contain at least one relevant bookmark in the lenient set (""Rank-Rel (lenient)""). As before, for both task types (single-aspect and multiaspect), we conducted a two-factor (interface and task) ANOVA at p  0.05 for all types of measurements. For multi-aspect tasks, the interface effect was significant for all measures; for singleaspect tasks, none of the effects was significant. We thus conducted a Bonferroni post-hoc test at p  0.05 between two interfaces for multi-aspect tasks; significant differences with the baseline are shown in bold. It can be observed that, when the participants used AspecTiles for multi-aspect tasks, they performed significantly fewer query reformulations, issued shorter queries, and clicked documents that are deeper in the ranked list, compared to the baseline interface. Though not statistically significant, similar trends can be observed for single-aspect tasks, except for the query length. We also examined other measurements such as the number of clicked documents and the time to complete the task session, but did not find any clear trends.",null,null
271,"The above significant differences between AspecTiles and the baseline interface are quite intuitive. With AspecTiles, users perform fewer query reformulations probably because the displayed aspects serve as an alternative to forming new queries. For example, if the displayed aspects represent more specific information needs than the current query, then the user may not have to add a new query term to the current query to explicitly specialize his need. This is also reflected in the significant differences in the average query length. Moreover, with AspecTiles, users dig deeper in the ranked lists, probably because AspecTiles lets the user quickly skip documents that appear to be irrelevant to the desired aspects. That is, provided that the choice of displayed aspects and the peraspect relevance shown in colors are both sufficiently accurate, AspecTiles may be able to let the user reach the desired documents efficiently. Moreover, note that five-tile AspecTiles outperforms three-tile AspecTiles in all of these measurements, though the differences are not statistically significant.",null,null

323,"Figure 6 confirms some of our aforementioned findings more qualitatively, and offers some additional insights into user behavior. For example, by comparing the rows of five-tile AspecTiles with those of the baseline, it can be observed not only that the latter contains more query reformulation operations (Q's), but that participants often reformulated queries at the very beginning of the search interactions with the baseline interface (See lines (1) and (4)). With the baseline interface, the number of sessions beginning with an immediate query reformulation was 17 for single-aspect tasks and 12 for multi-aspect tasks; in contrast, with five-tile AspecTiles, the same statistic was 8 for single-aspect tasks and 4 for multi-aspect tasks. Moreover, it can be observed that the number of clicked documents before finding the first relevant bookmark (D's to the left of the first square with a number) tends to be smaller with AspecTiles, which is again in line with our quantitative results. Furthermore, it can be observed that, with AspecTiles, participants tend to find a larger number of relevant bookmarks and relevant aspects, although these trends were not statistically significant in our quantitative results.",null,null
324,"Next, we discuss typical usage patterns of AspecTiles, which we have observed physically during the user experiments and also from the operation logs that we analyzed postmortem. An AspecTile user typically begins a session by checking the aspect labels of the initial search result. If the displayed aspects seem appropriate, he utilizes the tiles, i.e. place a mouse over a tile and see the aspect label as a popup text, and clicks the document. In Figure 6, this can",null,null

327,"be seen as a repetition of P's and D's (See lines (2), (3) and (6)). On the other hand, if the displayed aspects look unsatisfactory, the user often increases tiles and reformulate queries, as represented by T's and Q's in the figure (See lines (5) and (8)). For example, line (8) represents a multi-aspect task for ""I'm looking for information on Rick Warren, the evangelical minister. (biography, articles, books),"" where the initially displayed aspect labels were ""controversy, obama, sermons."" As the user judged that these displayed aspects did not directly match the three desired aspects, he immediately increased the number of displayed aspects (two T's at the beginning of the session). Again, this example suggests that the quality of the displayed aspects is important. Moreover, Figure 6 line (3) contains many nonrelevant bookmarks (N's), and this was because the document clicked by the user had a high estimated relevance to the aspect ""(atari) classic games"" even though it in fact discussed many other types of games besides Atari. Thus the user was misled by the color displayed by AspecTiles. Again, this highlights the importance of providing accurate relevance per-aspect estimates to the user.",null,null
328,"As an additional and inconclusive remark, it appeared that while participants with high computer skills (e.g. researchers) tended to actively reformulate queries without referring to the tiles, those with relatively lower computer skills tended to rely on the tiles.

It can be observed that the participants found AspecTiles useful for finding relevant information, easy to use and that they are willing to use it again, compared to the baseline (Q1-Q3).

Moreover, as our results show that the quality of displayed aspects and the accuracy of per-aspect relevance estimates are important for maximizing the benefit of AspecTiles, we plan to improve the backend search system. Finally, as we discussed in Section 4.2.2, we would like to identify the class of users for which interfaces like AspecTiles would be most helpful.",null,null
