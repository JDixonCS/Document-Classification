5,"In this paper, we propose a novel top-k learning to rank framework, which involves labeling strategy, ranking model and evaluation measure. The motivation comes from the difficulty in obtaining reliable relevance judgments from human assessors when applying learning to rank in real search systems. The traditional absolute relevance judgment method is difficult in both gradation specification and human assessing, resulting in high level of disagreement on judgments. While the pairwise preference judgment, as a good alternative, is often criticized for increasing the complexity of judgment from O(n) to O(n log n). Considering the fact that users mainly care about top ranked search results, we propose a novel top-k labeling strategy which adopts the pairwise preference judgment to generate the top k ordering items from n documents (i.e. top-k ground-truth) in a manner similar to that of HeapSort. As a result, the complexity of judgment is reduced to O(n log k). With the topk ground-truth, traditional ranking models (e.g. pairwise or listwise models) and evaluation measures (e.g. NDCG) no longer fit the data set. Therefore, we introduce a new ranking model, namely FocusedRank, which fully captures the characteristics of the top-k ground-truth. We also extend the widely used evaluation measures NDCG and ERR to be applicable to the top-k ground-truth, referred as -NDCG and -ERR, respectively. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark data collections to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our top-k labeling strategy and ranking models.",null,null

13,1. INTRODUCTION,null,null
,,,
14,"In the past few years, learning to rank has been widely recognized as an important technique for information retrieval (IR). A vital part to employ learning to rank in real search systems is the acquisition of reliable and high quality labeled datasets, both for training and evaluation. In traditional IR literature, assessors are requested to determine the relevance of a document under some pre-defined gradations, which is called absolute relevance judgment method. However, there are some significant drawbacks for this evaluation process. Firstly, the specifics of the gradations (i.e. how many grades to use and what those grades mean) must be defined, and it is not clear how these choices will affect relative performance measurements [26]. Secondly, the assessing burden increases with the complexity of the relevance gradations; the choice of label is not clear when there are more factors to consider, leading to high level of disagreement on judgments [4].",null,null
,,,
15,"Recently pairwise preference judgment has been investigated as a good alternative [20, 26]. Instead of assigning a relevance grade to a document, an assessor looks at two pages and judges which one is better. Compared with absolute relevance judgment, the advantages lie in that: (1) There is no need to determine the gradation specifications as it is a binary decision. (2) It is easier for an assessor to express a preference for one document over the other than to assign a pre-defined grade to each of them [7]. (3) Most state-of-the-art learning to rank models, pairwise or listwise, are trained over preferences. As noted by Carterette et al. [7], ""by collecting preferences directly, some of the noise associated with difficulty in distinguishing between different levels of relevance may be reduced."" Although preference judgment likely produce more reliable labeled data, it is often criticized for increasing the complexity of judgment (e.g. from O(n) to O(n log n) [20]), which poses a big challenge in wide use. Do we actually need to judge so many pairs for real search systems? If not, which pairs do we choose? How to choose? These questions become the original motivation of this paper.",null,null
,,,
16,"As we know, in real Web search scenario, it is well accepted that users mainly care about the top results [30]. In other words, the ordering of the top results (typically the results on the first one or two pages) is critical for users' search experience. It indicates that a labeling strategy shall take effort to figure out the top results and judge the preference orders among them, but pay less attention to the exact",null,null

18,"preference orders among the rest results. Based on this observation, we propose a novel top-k labeling strategy which adopts the pairwise preference judgment to generate the top k ordering items from a set of n items in a manner similar to that of HeapSort. The obtained ground-truth from this topk labeling strategy is a mixture of the total order of the top k items, and the relative preferences between the set of top k items and the set of the rest n - k items, referred as topk ground-truth. With this top-k labeling strategy, we can not only capture enough information for learning to rank [30], but also largely reduce the complexity of judgment to O(n log k).",null,null
,,,
19,"With top-k ground-truth, we find that traditional ranking models, either pairwise or listwise, are no longer suitable for the labeled data set. It is natural to introduce a mixed ranking model, with the listwise model capturing the total order of the top k items and the pairwise model capturing the relative preference between the set of top k items and the set of the rest n - k items. Such a mixed model can thus combine the advantages of both pairwise and listwise approaches to fully exploit the information in the top-k ground-truth. We refer such a mixed ranking model as FocusedRank, since it emphasizes more on the ordering of the top items.",null,null
,,,
20,"For evaluation, traditional IR evaluation measures (e.g., MAP, NDCG and ERR), which are mainly defined on the absolute judgment, cannot be directly applied to the top-k ground-truth. To address this problem, we extend NDCG and ERR to -NDCG and -ERR by taking a function of the position of items as the absolute relevance label. The proposed evaluation measures thus emphasize the importance of the ordering of the top k items. Unlike the evaluation measures based on preference judgments [6], -NDCG and -ERR keep the same form as NDCG and ERR thus enjoy all the merits of traditional IR evaluation measures.",null,null
,,,
21,"Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark data collections. Major experimental findings include: (1) With top-k labeling strategy, the time cost on labeling one pair is much less than that on one item in absolute relevance judgment, and the overall time cost is comparable with that in absolute relevance judgment. (2) With topk labeling strategy, the level of agreement on judgments is higher than that on absolute relevance judgment. (3) With FocusedRank, the ranking performance is significantly better than the state-of-the-art pairwise and listwise ranking models.",null,null

28,"In this section, we briefly review some related work on labeling strategy, ranking model and evaluation measure in learning to rank literature.",null,null
,,,
29,2.1 Labeling Strategy,null,null
,,,
30,"In learning to rank, labeling strategies can be divided into two categories: absolute judgment and relative judgment [21, 26, 32, 7].",null,null
,,,
31,"In absolute judgment, assessors are usually requested to assign a graded score to an item independent of the other items [15, 4, 27, 28, 29] under some pre-defined gradations. Such a labeling strategy has been widely adopted in both industry and academia to construct benchmark datasets in IR, e.g. TREC data sets (since 2000), Microsoft learning to rank datasets [18] and Yahoo! Learning to Rank challenge 2010 data set. One difficult problem in using absolute judgment is to clearly define the specifics of the gradations, i.e. how many grades to use and what those grades mean. Some previous studies tried to figure out the proper number of relevance gradations [22, 19]. However, as noted by Cox [12], ""there is no single number of response alternatives for a scale which is appropriate under all circumstances"". If the descriptions of each degree are not clearly defined, a multi-grade judgment method can be easily misused in the evaluation process [34]. Moreover, the assessing burden in absolute judgment increases with the complexity of the relevance gradations. When there are more factors to consider, the choice of label is not clear, resulting in high level of disagreement on judgments [4].",Y,
,,,
32,"In contrast, relative judgement aims to directly judge the relative order of a set of items [26]. As a typical form of relative judgment, pairwise preference judgment asks assessors to express a preference for one item over the other [6]. One concern of using this strategy is the complexity of judgment since the number of item pairs is polynomial in the number of items. Carterette et al. [7] attempted to reduce the number of pairs for judging by using transitivity of relevance among documents. Nir Ailon [1] proposed a formal pairwise method based on QuickSort which can reduce the number of preference judgments from O(n2) to O(n log n). Compared with O(n) in absolute judgment, this is still not affordable for assessors. To increase the efficiency of relative judgment, R. Song et al. [26] further proposed to select the best one each time from the remaining items, which is only applicable to small datasets. Different from the above related work, we propose a novel top-k labeling strategy to largely save the effort of preference judgment, by exploiting what Web search users actually care about on ranking.",null,null
,,,
33,2.2 Ranking Model,null,null
,,,
34,"So far learning to rank has been mainly addressed by pointwise, pairwise, and listwise ranking models. In pointwise models [17], ranking is transformed to regression or classification on individual items to represent the absolute label on each item. In pairwise models [14, 11, 3], ranking is transformed to classification on item pairs to represent the",null,null
,,,
35,752,null,null

36,"preference between two items. In listwise models [33, 31, 5], instances as document lists are generated through the comparison over item pairs, and it is superior in modeling more discriminative judgments. Therefore, we can conclude that, pointwise models is well suited for absolute relevance judgment; while both pairwise and listwise models are applicable in either absolute or relative judgment scenario.",null,null
,,,
37,"In previous work [30], Xia et al. extended three listwise ranking models, namely top-k ListMLE, top-k ListNet and top-k RankCosine, to fit the top-k scenario. Note that they addressed this scenario under the circumstances of traditional labeling strategy and evaluation measure. They conducted experiments on the top-k ListMLE, and claimed that the top-k ListMLE can outperform traditional pairwise and listwise ranking models. However, it cannot avoid the computational complexity on the entire permutation such as that in top-k ListNet.",null,null
,,,
38,"In our paper, we take the above ranking models as the baselines to show the superiority of FocusedRank.",null,null
,,,
39,2.3 Evaluation Measure,null,null
,,,
40,"To evaluate the effectiveness of a ranking model, many IR measures have been proposed. Here we give a brief introduction to several popular ones which are widely used in learning to rank. See also [16] for other measures.",null,null
,,,
41,"Precision@k [2] is a measure for evaluating top k positions of a ranked list using two grades (relevant and irrelevant) of relevance judgment. With Precision as the basis, Average Precision (AP) and Mean Average Precision (MAP) [2] are derived to evaluate the average performance of a ranking model.",null,null
,,,
42,"While Precision considers only two graded relevance judgments, Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [13] is an evaluation measure that can leverage the relevance judgment in terms of multiple ordered categories, and has an explicit position discount factor in its definition. By normalizing DCG@k with its maximum possible value, we will get another popular measure named Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain (NDCG).",null,null
,,,
43,"To relax the additive nature and the underlying independence assumption in NDCG, another evaluation measure, Expected Reciprocal Rank (ERR), is proposed in [8]. It implicitly discounts documents which are shown below very relevant documents, and is defined as the expected reciprocal length of time that the user will take to find a relevant document.",null,null
,,,
44,"Although MAP, NDCG and ERR are widely used in IR, they all adopt absolute relevance labels in their formulation, which imposes restrictions on direct application in the scenario of relative judgment. Therefore, new measures such as bpref , ppref , and nwppref [6] have been proposed. However, these measures have not been widely accepted by IR community. In this paper, we extend traditional IR evaluation measures to our relative judgment scenario with similar formulation.",null,null

50,3.1.1 Motivation,null,null
,,,
51,"In real Web search applications, users usually pay more attention to the top-k items [9, 25, 10]. For example, according to a user study [30], in modern search engines, about 62% of search users only click on the results within the first pages, and 90% of search users click on the results within the first three pages. It shows that the ordering of the top k results is critical for users' search experience. Two ranked lists of results will likely provide the same value to users (and thus suffer the same loss), if they have the same ranking results for the top positions [30]. Moreover, a good ranking on the top results is much more important than a good ranking on the others. Therefore, a labeling strategy shall take effort to figure out the top k results, judge the preference orders among them carefully, but pay less attention to the exact preference orders among the rest results.",null,null
,,,
52,3.1.2 Labeling Strategy,null,null
,,,
53,"Based on the above analysis, we propose a novel top-k labeling strategy using the pairwise preference judgment as the basis. The basic assumption for our labeling strategy is the transitivity of preference judgments of relevance [24, 7]. That is, if i is preferred to j and j is preferred to k, the assessor will also prefers i to k. With this assumption, our labeling strategy generate the top k ordering items from a set of n items in a manner similar to that of HeapSort. It mainly takes the following three steps:",null,null

54,"Step1 Randomly select k items from the set of n items and build a min-heap with t as the root based on the pairwise preference judgments by assessors. Here a min-heap is a complete binary tree with the property: if B is a child node of A, A is less relevant than B.",null,null
,,,
55,Step2 Randomly select an item r from the rest n - k items and the preference judgement is conducted between t and r by assessors. We then update the heap if necessary and obtain a new min-heap with the k most relevant items up till now. It is repeated until all the items have been selected.,null,null

To address this problem, we propose FocusedRank, a mixed ranking model with listwise ranking model capturing the total order of the top k items and pairwise ranking model capturing the relative preference between the set of top k items and the set of the rest n - k items.

282,4.1.1 Experiment Design,null,null
,,,
283,We describe our experimental design from the following four aspects:,null,null
,,,
284,"Data Set: We adopted all the 50 queries from the Topic Distillation task of TREC2003 as our query set. For each query, we then randomly sampled 50 documents from its associated documents for judgment. Existing Web pages in corpus of TREC2003 were employed in labeling to avoid the time delay in downloading content from Internet. In TREC topics, most of the queries have clear intent in the form of query descriptions, which are also exhibited along with the queries in labeling for better understanding.",Y,
,,,
285,"Labeling Tools: We designed labeling tools for two judgment methods separately, i.e., the top-k labeling tool T 1 and the traditional five-graded relevance judgment tool T 2. In T 1, a query with its description is shown at the top, and two associated Web pages are placed at the main area. An assessor is then asked to decide which one is more relevant. In T 2, a query with its description is shown at the top followed with five grade buttons, and a Web page is placed at the main area. An assessor is asked to decide which grade should be assigned to that page. A timer is introduced to both tools for computing time per judgment. Assessors can click the clock button to stop the timer if they want to have a break or leave for a while. This will ensure the computing accuracy.",null,null
,,,
286,Assessors: There are five assessors participating our user study. These assessors are all graduate students who are familiar with Web search. They all received a training in advance on how to use the tools and on the specifications of the five grades.,null,null
,,,
287,"Assignment: To make the comparison valid, the assignment should meet the following requirements. Firstly, for each method, all the selected documents should be judged at least once to obtain a complete data set. Secondly, for each assessor, he/she is most likely to memorize some information on the documents for a given query after judging. Therefore, to compare the methods independently, we shall ensure that each assessor will not see the same query under different tools to minimize the possible order effect. Finally, each tool has to be utilized by all the assessors to avoid the possible differences between individuals. Therefore, we adopted the following assignment to satisfy all the requirements: (1)",null,null

300,Two basic metrics are utilized to evaluate the labeling strategies.,null,null
,,,
301,"(1) Time efficiency: Time efficiency [26] is used to measure the cost of labeling. It is dependent on the time per judgment and the complexity of judgment (the total number of judgments for each query). Statistically, less time per judgment suggests easier judgment.",null,null
,,,
302,"(2) Agreement: Here we measure the agreement between two assessors over all judgments as [7] to average out differences in expertise, prior knowledge, or understanding of the query. For comparison, we inferred preferences from the absolute judgements: if the judgment on item A was greater than the judgment on item B, we inferred that A was preferred to B (denoted by A B). A tie between A and B is denoted by AB.",null,null
,,,
303,"As shown in Table 1, it is obvious that the average time per judgment in absolute judgments is longer than that of the preference judgments in top-k labeling strategy, e.g. about 2  3 times. The results verifies the common sense that the preference judgment is easier than absolute judgment. Meanwhile, from the average number of judgments conducted on each query, we can find that the top-k labeling strategy will take more judgments than the absolute judgments, at a scale around the theoretical value log k (i.e. k,""10). Most importantly, we can see that the total judgment time spent on each query is comparable between the two methods. The results indicate that by adopting the top-k labeling strategy, the complexity of pairwise preference judgment becomes similar to that of the absolute judgment. Therefore, it is feasible to use top-k labeling in practice.""",null,null

The overall agreement among assessors reaches 74.5% under top-k labeling, while it is only 54.7% under absolute judgment. We conducted 2 test to compare the ratio of the number of pairs agreed on to the number disagreed on for both top-k labeling and absolute judgment.

,,,
471,"In this paper, we propose a novel top-k learning to rank framework, including labeling, ranking and evaluation, which can be effectively adopted for real search systems. Firstly, a top-k labeling strategy is proposed to obtain reliable relevance judgments from human assessors via pairwise preference judgment. With this labeling strategy, we can largely reduce the complexity of pairwise preference judgment to O(n log k). Secondly, a novel ranking model FocusedRank is",null,null
,,,
472,"5The small size of the datasets may be the reason for the non-smooth variation curves with 50 queries on Graded TD2003 and Top-k TD2003, compared with more than one thousand queries on Graded MQ2007 and Top-k MQ2007.",null,null
,,,
473,"presented to capture the characteristics of the top-k groundtruth. Thirdly, two new top-k evaluation measures are derived to fit the top-k ground-truth. We verify the efficiency and reliability of the proposed top-k labeling strategy through user studies, and demonstrate the effectiveness of top-k ranking model by comparing with state-of-the-art ranking models.",null,null
,,,
474,"There are many interesting issues for further investigation under our top-k learning to rank framework. (1) The top-k labeling strategy could be improved to further reduce the judgment complexity. For example, we may introduce the ""Bad"" judgment like [7] for pages that are clearly irrelevant to further save labeling effort. (2) With top-k ground-truth, the design for new ranking models remains a valuable problem to investigate. (3) It is also possible to find new top-k based evaluation measures for better comparison between different systems.",null,null
