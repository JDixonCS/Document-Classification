21,"According to discourse analysis, every part in most coherent text tends to have some plausible reason for its presence, some function that it performs to the overall semantics of the text. Rhetorical relations, e.g. contrast, explanation, condition, are considered critical for text interpretation, because they signal how the parts of a text are linked to each other to form a coherent whole [23].

25,"There is a large body of research on both descriptive and predictive models of rhetorical structure and discourse analysis in natural language text. For instance, annotation projects have taken significant steps towards developing semantic [12, 18] and discourse [5] annotated corpora. Some of these annotation efforts have already had a computational impact, making it possible to automatically induce semantic roles [15] and to automatically identify rhetorical relations [14], achieving near-human levels of performance on certain tasks [27]. In addition, applications of discourse analysis to automatic language processing tasks such as summarisation or classification (overviewed in section 2) indicate that rhetorical relations can enhance the performance of welltrained natural language processing systems.",null,null
,,,
26,"Motivated by these advances, this work brings perspectives from discourse analysis into Information Retrieval (IR) with the aim of investigating if and how rhetorical relations can benefit retrieval effectiveness. Is there a correlation between certain rhetorical relations and retrieval performance? Can knowledge about a document's rhetorical relations be useful to IR? For example, consider the rhetorical relations of the text shown in Figure 1 (borrowed from [11]). Should some of the terms in this sentence be given extra weight by an IR system, according to their rhetorical relations? Can some rhetorical relations be considered more informative and hence more useful for IR ranking than others? These questions have been posed before (see discussion in section 2), however to our knowledge this is the first time that a principled integration of rhetorical relations into a probabilistic IR model improves precision by > 10%.",null,null

28,"Reasoning about query - document relevance using the language modeling formalism [9], we present a model that conditions the probability of relevance between a query and a document on the rhetorical relations occurring in that document. We present an application of this model to an IR re-ranking task, where, given a list of documents initially retrieved for a query, the goal is to improve the ranking of the documents by refining their estimation of relevance to the query. Experimental evaluation of different versions of our model on TREC data and standard settings demonstrates that certain rhetorical relations can be beneficial to retrieval, with notable improvements to retrieval effectiveness (> 10% in mean average precision and other standard TREC evaluation measures over a state-of-the-art baseline).",null,null

30,"Discourse analysis and rhetorical structures have been studied in the context of several automatic text processing applications. This has been partly enabled by the availability of discourse parsers - see [11, 14] for up-to-date overviews of discourse parsing technology. Studies of discourse analysis in relation to IR and its broader applications are briefly overviewed below. For a more general overview of discourse analysis approaches, see Wang et al. [33], section 2.",null,null
,,,
31,Sun & Chai [28] investigate the role of discourse processing and its implication on query expansion for a sequence of questions in scenario-based context question answering (QA). They consider a sequence of questions as a mini discourse. An empirical examination of three discourse theoretic models indicates that their discourse-based approach can significantly improve QA performance over a baseline of plain reference resolution.,null,null
,,,
32,"In a different task, Wang et al. [33] parse Web user forum threads to determine the discourse dependencies between posts in order to improve information access over Web forum archives. They present three different methods for classifying the discourse relationships between posts, which are found to outperform an informed baseline.",null,null
,,,
33,"Heerschop et al. [16] perform document sentiment analysis (partly) based on a document's discourse structure. They hypothesise that by splitting a text into important and less important text spans, and by subsequently making use of this information by weighting the sentiment conveyed by distinct text spans in accordance with their importance, they can improve the performance of a sentiment classifier. A document's discourse structure is obtained by applying rhetorical structure theory on a sentence level. They report a 4.5% improvement in sentiment classification accuracy when considering discourse, in comparison to a nondiscourse based baseline. Similarly to this study, Somasundaran et al. [26] report improvements to opinion polarity classification when using discourse, and Morato et al. [24] report a positive dependence between classification performance and certain discourse variables. An overview of discourse analysis for opinion detection can be found in Zhou et al. [36].",null,null
,,,
34,"In the area of text compression, Louis et al. [21] study the usefulness of rhetorical relations between sentences for summarisation. They find that most of the significant rhetorical relations are associated to non-discriminative sentences, i.e. sentences that are not important for summarisation. They report that rhetorical relations that may be intuitively perceived as highly salient do not provide strong indicators of",null,null
,,,
35,"informativeness; instead, the usefulness of rhetorical relations is in providing constraints for navigating through the text's structure. These findings are compatible with the study of Clarke & Lapata [7] into constraining text compression on the basis of rhetorical relations. For a more indepth look into the impact of individual rhetorical relations to summarisation see Teufel & Moens [30].",null,null

36,"In domain-specific IR, Yu et al. [34] focus on psychiatric document retrieval, which aims to assist users to locate documents relevant to their depressive problems. They propose the use of high-level discourse information extracted from queries and documents, such as negative life events, depressive symptoms and semantic relations between symptoms, to improve the precision of retrieval results. Their discourseaware retrieval model achieves higher precision than the vector space and Okapi models.",null,null
,,,
37,"Closer to our work, Wang et al. [31] extend an IR ranking model by adding a re-ranking strategy based on document discourse. Specifically, their re-ranking formula consists of the original retrieval status value computed with the BM11 model, which is then multiplied by a function that linearly combines inverse document frequency and term distance for each query term within a discourse unit. They focus on one discourse type only (advantage-disadvantage) which they identify manually in queries, and show that their approach improves retrieval performance for these queries. Our work differs on several points. We use an automatic (not manual) discourse parser to identify rhetorical relations in the documents to be retrieved (not queries). We consider 15 rhetorical relations (not 1) and we study their impact to retrieval performance using a modification of the IR language model.",null,null
,,,
38,"Finally, Suwandaratna & Perera [29] also present a reranking approach for Web search that uses discourse structure. They report a heuristic algorithm for refining search results based on their rhetorical relations. Their implementation and evaluation is partly based on a series of ad-hoc choices, making it hard to compare with other approaches. They report a positive user-based evaluation of their system for ten test cases.",null,null

41,"There may be various ways of considering rhetorical relations in an IR setting. In this work, we view rhetorical relations as non-overlapping text spans, rather than a graph or a tree with structure and overlapping nodes [27]. We select a principled integration of rhetorical relation information into the retrieval model that ranks documents with respect to queries.

This is a useful insight, especially for a collection as large as Clueweb09 cat. B where the chances of retrieving non-assessed documents are higher. NDCG measures the gain of a document based on its position in the result list. The gain is accumulated from the top of the ranked list to the bottom, with the gain of each document discounted at lower ranks. This gain is relative to the ideal based on a known recall base of relevance assessments [17].

This happens because quite often in text a topic forms the nucleus of the discourse, which is then linked by a number of different rhetorical relations, for instance about its background, elaborating on an aspect, or attributing parts of it to some entity. As a result, several types of other rhetorical relations can correspond to a single topic-comment.

An interesting trend is that more rhetorical relations improve performance according to BPREF than according to MAP and NDCG.

Only in one case, topic-comment, do the plotted points clearly cross. Overall both query sets show similar plots with outliers at both ends of the scale. However, the 2009 query set tends to have a somewhat larger proportion of negative outliers, which goes some way towards explaining the lower improvements over the baseline observed for Web 2009. The Web 2010 set shows improvements over the baseline for most of the rhetorical relations and for the majority of the queries.",Y,null

,,,
525,"The observations required to make the above inference are triples of rhetorical relation - query number - retrieval score. To avoid overfitting, we pool randomly 50% of the observations from the 2009 Web query scores and 50% of the observations from the 2010 Web query scores. We use this pool to infer the expected retrieval performance of each rhetorical relation. We repeat this randomised pooling five times, each time randomly pertrubing the data, producing five different sets of observations. We then use each set to infer the expected best performing rhetorical relation per query, in accordance to Equation 6. Following this, we use the model introduced in section 3, Equation 2, to rank documents with respect to queries only for optimal (as inferred) rhetorical relations. We evaluate the above method using the same experimental settings described in section 4.1.",null,null

,,,
559,6. DISCUSSION,null,null
,,,
560,6.1 Rhetorical Relation Distribution,null,null
,,,
561,"The distribution of the 15 rhetorical relations we identified in our dataset is not the same for all rhetorical relations (see Figure 2). Some types, e.g. topic-comment, tend to be very sparse, whereas relations such as elaboration prevail.",null,null
,,,
562,"This has no impact on the model presented in section 3, but it can bias the optimised inference of the model presented in section 5. The lower the occurrence of a rhetorical relation in the dataset, the fewer the observations of retrieval performance associated with it, and hence the weaker the predictions we can infer about whether it is optimal or not. A fairer setting would be to have the same number of `query - retrieval performance' observations for all rhetorical relations - however that would imply fiddling with the document distribution of our dataset significantly, potentially harming its quality as a test collection.",null,null
,,,
563,6.2 Limitations,null,null
,,,
564,"A general limitation of discourse analysis is that not all types of text are susceptible to it. For instance, legal text, contracts, or item lists often lack rhetorical structure. In this work, we made no effort to identify and exempt such types of text from the discourse parsing. We reasoned that, as the SPADE parser includes a first-step grammatical parsing, the initial grammatical parsing of these types of text would flag out ill-formed parts (e.g. missing a verb, or consisting of extremely long sentences), which would then be skipped by the discourse analysis. This was indeed the case, however at a certain efficiency cost. Overall processing speed for SPADE was approximately 19 seconds per document (including the initial grammatical parsing), on a machine of 9 GB RAM, 8 core processor at 2.27GHz. One way of improving this performance would be to update the first-step grammatical parsing. Currently this depends on the well-known Charniak parser [6], which is one of the best performing grammatical parsers, however no longer supported. Other state-of-theart faster grammatical parsers, e.g. the Stanford parser8, could be adapted and plugged into SPADE instead.",null,null
,,,
565,"The choice of applying our model for re-ranking as opposed to ranking all documents was closely related to the efficiency concerns discussed above. Our model is not specific to re-ranking only, however, using SPADE on approximately 50 million documents was too expensive at this point. Improving the discourse parser's efficiency is something we are currently working on, with the aim to apply our model for full ranking and see if the conclusions drawn from this work hold.",null,null
,,,
566,"Finally, the accuracy of the discourse parser was not considered in this work, apart from indications in the literature that SPADE is a generally well-performing parser [27]. Given that the default version of the parser we used is trained on news articles, one may reason that its accuracy could improve if we train it on the retrieval collection, or on doc-",null,null

569,"uments of the same domain. Note that, parsing accuracy aside, rhetorical relations assignment is not an entirely unambiguous process, even to humans [23]. For the purposes of this work, this type of fine-grained ambiguity may however not be important to retrieval performance.",null,null
,,,
570,6.3 Future Extensions,null,null
,,,
571,"Future extensions include primarily making SPADE scalable on large collections of documents as discussed above, as well as using more than one rhetorical relation per document. For instance, the posterior probabilities estimated in section 5.1 could be used to weight the text in each rhetorical relation. If those posteriors are too flat, an exponent could make them peakier. As the exponent goes to infinity, the maximum relation model presented in section 5.2 would be recovered. In addition, we intend to refine the discourse analysis by considering the nucleus (i.e. central) versus satellite (i.e. peripheral) rhetorical relations for IR, as well as to improve the effectiveness of the discourse parser by training it on data of the same domain. As discussed in section 3.2, we will also investigate alternative estimations of Equations 2-3.",null,null
,,,
572,"An interesting future research direction is the potential relation between rhetorical relations and user context: for instance, in a search session including several query reformulations, is there a correlation between the progression of the information need of the user and the rhetorical relations that the retrieval system should boost in a document (e.g. elaboration), as indicated by Sun & Chai [28]? Another interesting future extension of this work is in relation to evaluation measures of graded relevance measures on an inter-document level, as investigated in XML retrieval [20] for instance. If parts of a document can be regarded as more or less relevant, this may be reflected to their discourse structure. This might be especially useful for multi-threaded documents, such as multiple-user reviews and opinions, where the discourse relations tend to shift markedly. Finally, the current operationalisation of our model is simplistic in the sense that the term `rhetorical relation' is coerced into meaning `non-overlapping text fragment' and the actual relation between bits of text is discarded in the process. In future work we could apply fielded XML retrieval models in order to investigate nested structuring among rhetorical relations.",null,null
,,,
573,7. CONCLUSIONS,null,null
,,,
574,"Rhetorical relations, e.g. contrast, explanation, condition, indicate the different ways in which the parts of a text are linked to each other to form a coherent whole. This work studied two questions: Is there a correlation between certain rhetorical relations and retrieval performance? Can knowledge about a document's rhetorical relations be useful to IR? To address these, we presented a retrieval model that conditions the probability of relevance between a query and a document on the rhetorical relations occurring in that document. We applied that model to an IR re-ranking scenario for Web search. Experimental evaluation of different versions of our model on TREC data and standard settings demonstrated that certain rhetorical relations can be beneficial to retrieval, with >10% improvements to retrieval precision. Furthermore, we showed that these improvements over the baseline can improve significantly, when the optimal rhetorical relation per document is selected for retrieval.",null,null
,,,
575,"Overall, three rhetorical relations were found to benefit",null,null
,,,
576,"retrieval performance notably and consistently for different evaluation measures and query sets: background, causeresult and topic-comment. In retrospect, this is perhaps not surprising, since these are among the most salient discourse relations on an intuitive basis: the main topic or theme of a text, its background, causes and results [21]. Future extensions and research directions of this work include considering more than one rhetorical relation per document, applying our model for ranking all documents (as opposed to re-ranking only) and experimenting with alternative estimations of its components.",null,null
