Prevalent among those signals, and central to most standard retrieval approaches such as BM25 and language models, is the term frequency (tf) information (i.e., the number of times a term appears in a document). Approaches derived from the probabilistic retrieval model are implemented as a summation of ""weights"" of the query terms that appear in the document, where the weight is essentially a normalized version of term frequency.",null,null
,,,
19,"Traditional probabilistic relevance frameworks for informational retrieval [30] refrain from taking positional information into account, both because of the hurdles of developing a sound model while avoiding an explosion in the number of parameters and because positional information has been shown (somehow surprisingly) to have little effect on average [34]. Recently, though, it has been proved that considering sequences of terms that form query concepts is beneficial for retrieval [6]. Those extensions build up on the Markov Random Field retrieval model (MRF) and use a linear combination of different concepts and query-term scores in order to derive a final score for a document. Furthermore, the well-known BM25F extension of the successful Okapi ranking function (the latter of which we are aiming on building upon) can be seen as an embryonic attempt in the same direction: the basic idea there is that each document is made of regions (fields) and some fields may provide stronger evidence of relevance than others.",null,null
,,,
20,"In this paper, we proceed along the same line, defining the notion of virtual region: a virtual region is a part of the document that, like a BM25F-field, can provide a different evidence of relevance of the document (the amount of evidence is, like in BM25F, expressed by a weight). Differently from BM25F fields, though, virtual regions are generated implicitly by applying suitable operators to the query: such operators may (and typically will) use positional information.",null,null
,,,
21,"The techniques we propose can be seen as a two-stage ranking: in the first stage, a number of operators are applied to the incoming query to individuate virtual regions within the document; in the second stage, the regions are ranked much in the same way as with BM25F, using the weights attached to each operator. The idea is that there are ""stricter"" operators, that give a stronger evidence (e.g., ""I want that at least three of the query terms appear in a span of at most ten words""), but are less likely to appear in document, and other that are ""weaker"" (e.g., ""I want at least one of the query terms appearing somewhere"", that is",null,null

,,,
25,"Abstracting from the positional aspect, we can think of our method as an attempt to understand more deeply the user's intent underlying a query [2], following the increasing interest in extracting features and learning about the query itself. For example, all major search engines are able to detect entities in queries in order to shortcut the user to an appropriate vertical (e.g., for e-commerce or news), to trigger different visualization schemes or simply to help ranking better the results that are being produced. The basic idea is that of being able to pre-process a plain set of query terms that a user submitted to build a model of the query (possibly with the help of contextual information, e.g., about the query session and/or the user's profile). This model might simply contain spelling corrections, term annotations or may exhibit more sophisticated expansions, obtained through gazetteers, synonym dictionaries or query-logs, just to name a few.",null,null

26,"In general, we observe that information retrieval is moving from a document-centric to a query/user-centric approach, and modern search engines are investing large amounts of research in building better, more comprehensive query models. The question that we address in this paper is whether it is possible to extend the classical probabilistic formulation so as to accommodate in a natural way these extended query models for enhancing ranking, in both Web search and more classical TREC-like retrieval settings.",Y,null

28,"Summing up, this paper aims at proposing an extension of the probabilistic retrieval framework [30] that accounts for the information coming from queries and documents. Our approach can be seen as a principled way of integrating query-document features into a BM25-based model [32], by extending the event space using a number of operators that derive from a query model [7]. For instance, both BM25 and BM25F [33] could be regarded as a special case of the method presented here. The framework operates in a general manner by means of a set of operators that are materialized using query-derived information; each operator determines a (possibly empty) virtual region within the document, that is treated as a (weighted) field; query-term frequencies in each virtual region are used to compute the final score of the document. We shall frame our technique as an extension of BM25(F) and describe how it can be implemented efficiently. Finally, we provide experimental evaluation of our approach showing that the usage of operators outperforms state-ofthe-art ranking that use just matching of query terms and is especially helpful for difficult queries. The software implementing our technique and used for the experiments will be made available at http://mg4j.dsi.unimi.it/.",null,null

30,Some lines of research attempt at addressing the issue of adding semantic information to documents and queries [22]. The model that we present (which could indeed encode [22],null,null
,,,
31,"as a special case) can be seen as a template for grounding different graphical model instances, in the spirit of Markov Logic Networks [18, 29], even though in this paper we make no attempt to generalize the learning procedure of the probabilities involved in the model, and the inference we perform is restricted to one particular formulation and combination. However, the very structure of our method allows one to extend it to different combinations and aggregation functionals over probability distributions. Robertson et al. [33] introduced BM25F, a variation of BM25 that is able to deal with matches of query terms in different fields of the document, boosting them differently. Our framework stems from the same fundamental notions of BM25F and BM25 (term eliteness, re-weighting of term matches) and it is able to extend/accommodate both.",null,null
,,,
32,"There are several recent papers that deal with spans of terms in ranking. Svore et al. [35] show that introducing spans of terms as a further feature for machine learning to rank model gives improvements over BM25. Other authors have dealt with the issue of incorporating these spans of terms into the language model framework, the first one being the Markov Random Field (MRF) model of Metzler and Croft [26], extending the language modeling framework for information retrieval [27, 39] to handle term dependencies. Some other approaches [11] compute the aggregated distance of matches and add it to the BM25 score, or define a kernel-like distance [23, 24] that can be successfully used for ranking by plugging it into a language-model divergence between the query and document estimation. One remarkable model close to ours is that of Bendersky et al. [5], who weight different query concepts using a parameterized combination of diverse importance features: those concepts can be single query keyword, phrases matching in the document, or matches of keywords that span a window of a certain size. The amount of matching concepts in the document are later integrated into the MRF ranking model. In our case we focus on extending BM25 and not the language modeling framework, the core difference being in the way information is aggregated for each term during ranking.",null,null

35,"As explained in the introduction, the basic approach of this paper is to extract, from a given query, a number of regions in the document using suitable operators. Alternatively, you can think that a given input query is refined in a number of different ways using some refinement operators, that may (and typically will) use positional information; virtual regions are then the regions matching each of the refined queries.",null,null

41,(young nice)~3 OR (young girl)~3 OR (nice girl)~3.,null,null
,,,
42,"When a document is considered against this query, all the areas where at least two of the three queried word appear either consecutively or one word apart are selected. This will determine a (possibly empty) sub-document, in which we can count the frequency of each of the three query words.",null,null

43,"Operators 2, instead, applied to the same query will produce",null,null
,,,
44,young OR nice OR girl;,null,null
,,,
45,and would just extract the occurrences of either of the three query words from the document.,null,null
,,,
46,"Clearly, a large frequency in the virtual region determined by 1 would be far more predictive of relevance than that determined by 2 (the latter would amount to actually counting the usual term frequency in the whole document).",null,null
,,,
47,"To gain some experimental support for this intuition we performed the following experiment: we considered the topics 701-850 from the TREC GOV2 collection, and built queries using the words in their title. To each query, we applied three operators: the plain or operator (corresponding to the usual bag-of-words interpretation of the query), the 2-and operator (satisfied only by documents that contain at least any two of the query terms) and the 2-gram operator (satisfied by documents that contain two terms consecutively).",null,null
,,,
48,"Then, for each matching document, we computed the frequency of the query terms within the virtual region and we determined if the document was relevant or not; the fraction of relevant documents is plotted against term frequency. Figure 1 shows the results of the experiment, and provides two fundamental evidences: first of all, stricter operators (2-grams, for instance) provide for the same term frequency a larger probability of relevance, as expected; secondly, the behavior shows in all cases the well-known phenomenon of saturation -- as the frequency increases, relevance also increases but at a slower and slower pace, giving rise to the typical sigmoid-shaped function.",null,null
,,,
49,"Our approach is blind with respect to the operators being considered, which is part of its generality.

Linear combinations of features are able to bring increased performance; however, when taking into account evidence coming from the same source of information it is beneficial to understand the distributional properties of the signal the model has to deal with. In these cases, the information employed for ranking is always taken from the number of times one term or a sequence of terms matches a document. In contrast, if one was to incorporate other features, like query-independent document quality [17], or click-based information [1], a linear combination might be",null,null

83,"Traditional probabilistic models, like BM25, assume that the relevance of a document to a query can be determined by aggregating individual contributions of the query terms. That is, given the binary random variable R representing relevance, and the vectors of random variables representing the document D and query Q, we want to rank documents according to their increasing odds-probability [30]. Here Q is (or can be thought of as) a set of terms, while Dt is a multi-state variable that encodes the features about the occurrence of term t in D (term frequency, position, etc.); we assume that those features contain a natural zero, corresponding to the absence of t and represented by 0. We let d and q denote two actual realizations of D and Q, and r (r) represent the event R , 1 (R ,"" 0, respectively), i.e., the document being relevant (irrelevant, respectively). Then, within the probabilistic framework, documents are ranked""",null,null

Empirical evidence on retrieval performances of BM25 suggests that this indeed is often the case. For example, it is true that query terms New and York are correlated in relevant documents for the query New York pizza, but they are also correlated in the whole collection.""",null,null

Plugging this assumption in the general formula derived above determines a monotonic weighting function with an horizontal asymptote that may be interpreted as a form of saturation: the probability of relevance increases with term frequency, but the amount of increase is ultimately close zero when the frequency becomes large.

153,"Here, the only features that we need to observe are term frequencies; this is a quite mild assumption and stems from the idea that documents are a single body of text with no structure whatsoever. Some earlier refinements of the probabilistic model, however, already introduced the idea that documents may have some structure. In BM25F [33], for example, a notion of region was introduced: each document is made up of regions, or fields, (e.g., title, body, footnotes etc.) and it is possible to observe term frequencies separately in each region. This extension accounts for the fact that some fields may be more predictive for relevance than others (for example, title will be more predictive than footnotes), and fits well in the eliteness model. The idea is that eliteness of terms is decided beforehand, for every given document, and it is the same across fields; term-frequency, instead, will be again modeled as in standard BM25, although it will be influenced by the length of each field--of course, shorter fields (such as title) are expected to contain more elite terms than longer ones.",null,null

392,4.2 Remarks and variants,null,null

393,"BM25, following the original probabilistic relevance framework, adopts a disjunctive semantics, that is, there is no need for a document to contain every query term in order to receive a non-zero score. The key point behind this assumption is that we need an external mechanism to decide which eliteness models we want to take into account for each query, and this will simplify the number of estimations and scores we need to compute. After that, it is important to",null,null
,,,
394,"4Both the p-gram, the phrasal and the segment operators can be endowed with an enlargement factor that allows for some extra word to sneak in--also this point will be fully explained in Section 5. 5The length-normalization factor here might actually be different for each virtual region, but this solution turns out to be extremely expensive to implement, because the average region length is unknown unless the whole collection is examined. A good approximation can be obtained by using the standard document length as a measure of ""verbosity"" of all the virtual regions it contains.",null,null
,,,
395,decide what is an appropriate shape of the functional estimating relevance probability as a function of term scores: in Section 3 we showed empirically that conjunctive and proximity operator produce the same shape as in the 2-Poisson eliteness model.,null,null
,,,
396,"An issue raised by our model, and that we must take into account, is the fact that the very same occurrence of a term within a document will be counted more than once, because virtual regions (differently from BM25F fields) may overlap. For instance, if we want to score separately matches of stemmed query terms and matches of unstemmed query terms we would be double-scoring some of the occurrences. This remark calls for discounting signals coming from the same source; one way to obtain this result would be to establish some dependence between the operators j: in the example above, we might correct the estimation using a p(sjt | ejx, r) correction factor (here, and in the following, the superscripts st and ex stand for ""stemmed"" and ""exact"", respectively).",null,null
,,,
397,"In practice, however, we can avoid this estimation by recalibrating the different weights. We empirically know that both exact and stemmed matches should contribute to the score on which the saturation function is applied, and we want to aggregate those contributions together, using the proper weights. We can then correct the double counting and substitute accordingly in equation (1) as",null,null

434,5. QUERY CONCEPT SEGMENTATION,null,null
,,,
435,"Albeit today's search engines offer a limited number of operators (phrasal, proximity etc.) most users tend to stick at introducing plain queries, typically a sequence of few words (about 3.08 on average, according to recent studies [36]). Nonetheless, as observed previously [37], many queries are actually made up by some basic conceptual units, each of them being formed possibly by many words. For example, the query indian summer victor herbert is clearly formed by two conceptual elements (""indian summer"" and ""victor herbert"", the former referring to a meteorological phenomenon, the second to a person); breaking such conceptual units apart, or inverting the order of the words that label them, would produce information loss--of course, many documents will contain both the words ""indian"" and ""summer"" without referring to ""indian summer""; also ""summer indian"" will also probably appear in some document, for example in reference to summer indian food, without any relevance to the concept sought. In some cases, it may be wise to allow for one spurious word to be inserted within a segment (so that, for example, san jose airport can also match the sequence ""San Jose international airport"", or george bush match ""George W. Bush"").",null,null
,,,
436,"Among our goals, we would like the model to accommodate for query term-dependence, or concept-detection, at the query level. For example, if there is evidence that the query san jose aiport consists of two concepts, one referring to a city and the other one denoting a place or an action, we would like the model to be able to weight differently documents that only match one concept from those that match both, taking also into account the distance between the terms making up the concepts. To this end, one of our operators will employ query segmentation, an emerging NLP task that aims at identifying sub-sequences of strings that refer to a single unit or concept [7, 37], as described above. There have been limited attempts to integrate segments into ranking [5, 6, 20] in the context of the language modeling framework [39], but to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a similar attempt is being applied to BM25-like techniques.",null,null
,,,
437,"In the experimental section, we use both a segmentation operator based on generative language models and Wikipedia (as described in [37]) and a simple operator extracting pgrams of consecutive terms: the latter is of course less precise (because some p-grams do not correspond to concepts), and is given a lower weight -- it serves the purpose of identifying possible word-sequences that for some reason the segmentation algorithm failed to guess. Moreover, for both types of operators we allowed for a variety of amount of spurious words appearing in the segment: this is obtained by introducing different enlargement factors µ (a multiplicative factor determining the maximum allowed ratio between the length of the span found and the length of the segment);",null,null
,,,
438,"an enlargement factor µ ,"" 1 corresponds to accepting only exact matches, whereas for example allowing for an enlargement µ "","" 2 corresponds to accepting at most one extra word for every single word in the segments (e.g., if the segment is made up of two words, it is still acceptable if we find them two words apart). Different enlargement factors are used in the experiments, of course assigning larger weights to smaller enlargements.""",null,null

445,"We tested the usefulness and accuracy of the operators described in Section 4.1 and 5 in a series of experiments. We posit that query segments will only affect to a limited number of queries in the data-set; however the working question is whether combining them has some positive retrieval effect or not. Retrieval performance is optimized iteratively using MAP as a target metric. We sweep one parameter at a time over the allowed parameter range, holding every other parameter fixed, in a similar fashion to the method of Metzler and Croft [26]. Each operator introduces two parameters: a weight wj controlling the relative importance of the operator, and a factor bj determining the impact of termfrequency normalization with respect to the corresponding operator. Different enlargement factors µ (for segments, pgrams and phrasal operators) are reported in separate rows of the table, as well as different values for the number p of consecutive terms that are considered while building pgrams.",null,null

446,"We report on MAP and P@10 and check for statistical significance using a one-sided t-test with p < 0.05. The operators are trained on two different Web collections: GOV2, TREC's Terabyte track collection [14, 15, 12], and a subsample of the Web from 2011. The collections are described in Table 1. Training and testing is performed on different topic sets; for TREC topics, we train and test on different years (train on TERA04, test on TERA05/06; train on TERA05, test on TERA04), and for the Web collection we perform 10-fold cross validation across the whole topic set. For the TREC collection, we used the topic title as raw query.",Y,null

Experiments show that all the operators are able to improve the performance on their own to a reasonable extent. The impact of single operators, specially the segments, is limited. However, it is worth noting that the methods using a single operator that restrict the semantics of the matching (like AND or segments) perform comparably to the best values reported at TREC for early precision (P@20) [14, 15, 12]. Table 3 presents the results of combining segment and p-gram operators with BM25 and BM25F.

The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether the sigmoid-like term-frequency normalizing function is able to accommodate for different features which stem from the same source of evidence (matches of the query term in the document). Results are significantly better than the baseline and outperform state-of-the-art ranking functions that just use matching of query terms (note we are not adding query-independent evidence, like link information, click-through data, etc.). For instance, the best MAP value for TREC 2004 at TERA04 [14] was 0.2844, the sequential dependence model of the Markov random field for IR peaks at MAP 0.2832 [26] and the two-stage segmentation model of Bendersky et al. had an average MAP of 0.2711 over the 150 topics [5].",null,null

495,"In order to explore further the usefulness of query segmentation and p-grams for difficult queries, we selected a subsample of 1000 queries taken from Yahoo! Search; the data corpus was a 100GB sub-sample of the Web. The queries had been evaluated by a trained editorial team, with about 130 judged documents per query on average: relevance was assigned on a 4-level scale, from Bad to Excellent; given that we had graded relevance available, we report on NDCG (gain values at the relevance level, from 0 to 4) and MAP. The average query length was 3.14. We report the performance of BM25 and BM25F as baselines. In addition, we selected a sub-sample of 400 queries where the user herself had employed query segments (i.e., phrasal queries), and removed the segmentation information. This experiment was aimed at establishing if a more elaborate query interpretation mechanisms is able to be of help in these cases.",null,null

496,"Table 4 shows that segmentation and p-grams, when mixed with the operator combination are able to improve the performance of a large number of Web queries. When looking at the differences between the regular and phrasal queries, we observe that gains, even if consistent over the two different sets, are slightly higher in the second group ( 12.3% vs.  7.1% in MAP for p-grams vs. BM25F). This fact indicates that the method is helpful for queries that contain difficult concepts, as they have been expressed by users manually, whereas maintaining the performance of queries in which identifying concepts is not so critical and standard bag-of-word approaches perform as well.",null,null

500,7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK,null,null
,,,
501,"In this paper we proposed a way to extend the probabilistic relevance framework with a notion of virtual region based on the use of operators applied to the query. Our experiments (both on standard collections, such as TREC, and on other Web-like repertoires) show that the use of virtual regions is especially beneficial for hard queries where positional information is actually precious. The method has room for improvements and further study should be undertaken to understand which operators are more useful and under which circumstances. Even if we explored a reasonable number of combinations, we have not made any systematic attempt to develop a method to select the individual best operators; we just limited ourselves to handpick a few--it was out of the scope of this paper to analyze automated operator selection. In contrast, a machine learning approach [3] would derive features for as many operators as possible and try to combine them optimizing a loss function of MAP or NDCG [38]. One might even envisage the adoption of a query-classification tool to decide which operators should be used, based on the presumed nature of the query. In any case, our experiments show the practical usefulness of the non-linear operator score combination for retrieval [33]. As a final remark, it is interesting to observe that most of the studied operators (actually, all of them except for segments) do not employ any source of external information, and still produce a significant performance improvement.",Y,null
