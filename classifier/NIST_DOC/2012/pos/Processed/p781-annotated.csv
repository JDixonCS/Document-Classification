6,"User votes are important signals in community question-answering (CQA) systems. Many features of typical CQA systems, e.g. the best answer to a question, status of a user, are dependent on ratings or votes cast by the community. In a popular CQA site, Yahoo! Answers, users vote for the best answers to their questions and can also thumb up or down each individual answer. Prior work has shown that these votes provide useful predictors for content quality and user expertise, where each vote is usually assumed to carry the same weight as others. In this paper, we analyze a set of possible factors that indicate bias in user voting behavior ­ these factors encompass different gaming behavior, as well as other eccentricities, e.g., votes to show appreciation of answerers. These observations suggest that votes need to be calibrated before being used to identify good answers or experts. To address this problem, we propose a general machine learning framework to calibrate such votes. Through extensive experiments based on an editorially judged CQA dataset, we show that our supervised learning method of content-agnostic vote calibration can significantly improve the performance of answer ranking and expert ranking.",null,null

17,"provide an environment for people to share knowledge and experience, which complement search engines by allowing questions to be posed in natural language and be answered by human beings through active content (i.e., answers) creation, instead of mining existing Web pages. Since the basis of CQA systems is the wide participation, the hurdle for users to proffer answers is typically minimal. Hence, CQA systems are also prone to spam and other kinds of abuse. Commercial spam itself is a widespread problem, and one that can mostly be tackled by conventional machine learning. Other forms of abuse, e.g., low quality content, willfully wrong answers are difficult for machines to detect, and again crowdsourcing quality content identification is an engaging, scalable way of ensuring that high quality questions and answers are identified and the creators appropriately rewarded. Different CQA systems have thus implemented different kinds of voting mechanisms coupled with user reputation systems in order to surface high quality content and discourage undesired behavior.",null,null
,,,
18,"In this paper, we focus on votes in CQA sites. Take Yahoo! Answers for example, which is heavily dependent on the best answer voting scheme. An asker (user who asks a question) can vote for the best answer to his/her question. If the asker does vote, the best answer is declared and the question is labeled as resolved. If the asker does not vote for the best answer within certain period of time, other users in the community can vote for the best answer to that question. The answer that receives the largest number of best-answer votes within a certain period of time is then declared as the best answer to this question, and the question is declared resolved. Other than best-answer votes, users can also demonstrate their quality or opinion preferences by casting thumb-up or thumbdown votes on each individual answer.",Y,null
,,,
19,"Although such voting mechanisms are designed with the intuition that they should be able to identify high quality answers and the corresponding answerers, there has been little study on the actual effectiveness of these systems in achieving this goal. On the other hand, many studies [1, 6, 15, 3, 8, 17, 10] have treated the user-voted best answers as the ground truth source of high quality answers and have developed models to predict whether an answer would be voted as the best answer based on features extracted from the answer, past activities of the answerer, etc. As a counter-point, other studies, e.g., [14, 9], report best answers not to be entirely high quality ones. In fact, as part of this work, we also observe that user-voted best answers do not always have high quality, possibly because of bias in users' voting behavior. A few examples of potential bias are:",null,null
,,,
20,· Users may vote more positively for their friends' answers.,null,null
,,,
21,781,null,null
,,,
22,Even users who have interacted with each other in the CQA before might have a positive or negative bias depending on their past experience.,null,null
,,,
23,· Users may use votes to show their appreciation to answerers instead of trying to identify high quality content.,null,null
,,,
24,· Users who are trying to game the system in order to obtain high status can create multiple accounts and vote for one another.,null,null
,,,
25,"· For questions about opinions, users tend to vote for the answers that share same opinions as theirs, but not necessarily of high quality.",null,null
,,,
26,"Thus, instead of treating users' best-answer votes as the ground truth for answer quality, we ask trained human editors to judge answers based on a set of well-defined guidelines. Our first observation is that raw user votes have low correlation with editorial judgment. Based on this finding, we ask ""is it possible to calibrate the votes to mitigate the effects of potential bias, in order to increase the correlation between votes and editorially judged answer quality?""",null,null
,,,
27,Contributions: We make the following contributions.,null,null
,,,
28,"· We propose the novel problem of vote calibration in CQA systems. The basic idea is to associate every vote with a weight. Intuitively, votes from reputable voters who consistently vote for high quality answers should carry more weight, while votes susceptible to bias should carry less weight.",null,null
,,,
29,"· In Section 5, based on exploratory data analysis we identify a variety of potential factors that possibly bias the votes.",null,null
,,,
30,"· We develop a novel model for vote calibration based on supervised learning in Section 4. Intuitively, with each vote k we associate a feature vector xk which includes features capturing potential bias. Then, the importance weight of vote k is a function of the weighted sum of feature values, i.e., f (xk), where  is a vector of regression coefficients, xk is the inner product of xk and , and f (·) is a monotone function. Based on a set of editorially labeled answers,  is determined by minimizing the error of using calibrated votes f (xv) to predict the editorial labels.",null,null
,,,
31,"· In Section 7, we experimentally show that the proposed vote calibration model outperforms a number of alternative methods for the answer ranking problem and the expert ranking problem. In particular, our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art SVM model [12] for expert ranking.",null,null
,,,
32,"We note that since our focus is on vote calibration, we take a contentagnostic approach (i.e., no use of features extracted from answer content) similar to [12]. This makes our model applicable to votes on other types of content. Also, although we use Yahoo! Answers as the example CQA system throughout the paper, our model can be easily applied to other CQA systems. In fact we believe that our approach has the following useful properties ­ (i) it is robust to vote gaming, having incorporated a variety of such gaming behavioral features, and (ii) it provides a general framework for calibrating user votes in general crowdsourced rating platforms.",Y,null

33,2. RELATED WORK,null,null
,,,
34,"Although there have been many studies on CQA, to our knowledge, the problem of how to calibrate user votes to improve the correlation between votes and answer quality has not been systematically studied before. The related work can broadly be categorized into three threads.",null,null
,,,
35,"Predicting user-voted best answers: There is a large body of work on building models to predict user-voted best answers (e.g., [1, 6, 15, 3, 8, 17, 10]). The assumption behind this line of work is that quality judgments of answers are expensive to obtain and it seems to be reasonable to use the readily available user-voted best answers as the target to predict. Different from this line of work, we do not try to predict user-voted best answers, but show that user-voted best answers may not be high quality ones because of potential bias in users' voting behavior. Our focus is on how to calibrate votes to minimize the discrepancy between votes and quality.",null,null
,,,
36,"Predicting editorial judgments: Along with [2, 7, 16, 9, 14, 12], we define answer quality by a set of guidelines and obtain the ground-truth quality scores through an editorial process. For example, Agichtein et al. [2] used features extracted from text, user interaction graphs and votes to predict editorial judgments. Suryanto et al. [16] developed a number of graph-based methods to estimate user expertise, and evaluated these methods using editorially judged quality and relevance. Sakai et al. [9, 14] noticed bias in users' voting behavior that can cause user-voted best answers to be unsuitable for model evaluation, and proposed a number of evaluation methods based on editorial judgments. Similar to these studies, we also want to predict editorially labeled quality scores. Although user votes have commonly been used as features, calibration of each individual vote has not be studied.",null,null
,,,
37,"Content-agnostic user expertise estimation: User expertise score estimation is an important use case of vote calibration. In the Section 7, we will show that using a simple average of the calibrated votes of a user as his/her expertise score can outperform the best methods reported in Liu et al. [12], where a variety of methods, such as PageRank-based method, HITS-based methods, competition-based methods, are empirically compared based on editorial judgments. Earlier work on user expertise is described in the following. Zhang et al. [18] proposed a PageRank-style algorithm for online forums. Jurczyk et al. [11] leveraged the HITS algorithm. Pal et al. [13] exploited the observation that experts usually answer questions that have not yet received good answers. Bouguessa et al.

57,"· The distribution of editorial grades for best answers are not very different from that of non-best answers, although the percentage of excellent or good best answers is slightly higher than that of excellent or good non-best answers.

58,"· A significant percentage (> 70%) of best answers are not even good (i.e., fair or bad).

66,"We present our vote calibration model in this section. Let zk  {+1, -1} denote the value of vote k. The basic idea is simple.

In order to determine these importance weights, we define a set of features to capture potential bias in users' voting behavior. Let xk denote the feature vector of vote k. Then, we predict importance weight wk using its corresponding features; i.e., wk ,"" f (xk), where  is a vector of regression coefficients, xk is the inner product of the two column vectors (xk is the transpose of xk), and f (·) is a monotone function to calibrate the value xk (for example, to constrain wk to be between 0 and 1).

211,"Before we define the features to be used in our calibration model, we discuss a range of potential indicators of voting bias in this section. In the interest of space, we mainly use community bestanswer (CBA) votes to show our analysis. Many of the insights also apply to other types of votes.",null,null
,,,
212,"Characteristics of CBA votes: First, the importance of CBA votes is seen in Figure 1, which plots the fraction of questions resolved by CBA votes as a function of the number of answers to the question. On average around 61% of the total number of questions in our corpus get resolved by CBA votes, and this fraction reaches its peak for questions with smaller number of answers (being near 70% for questions with less than three answers). One possible explanation for the U-shaped curve of Figure 1 could be that the number of answers being too small indicates that the question is probably not interesting, likely posed by a casual user who is less inclined to give a best answer vote herself ­ and thus the community has to step in.",null,null

There is a clear linear trend up for questions with  30 answers. Beyond that, the trend is almost flat and noisier. Sparsity of data is likely the main reason behind the noise. The flatness of the trend can be possibly explained by the fact that a community member looking to vote an answer as CBA is likely only to look at the top few answers in the page; some answers can also be submitted after the CBA deadline passes.",null,null
,,,
233,"In the following, we discuss our observations about some potential sources of bias that we see in our dataset. For each of these sources, it is important to note that we are not claiming that this bias immediately implies that the corresponding CBA votes provide no signal to predict answer quality.

234,"Self Voting: Figure 3 shows the extent of self voting (where a user votes for his/her own answers) in our dataset. Self votes contribute to 33% of the total CBA votes, and when we consider users who cast at least 20 votes, the percentage of self votes goes even above 40%. Self votes are certainly unlikely to represent any quality judgment, they can at most be taken as a signal of the user's familiarity with the voting mechanism of the CQA site, which in itself could provide a useful signal.",null,null

266,"One interesting user-user interaction, almost a ""quid pro quo"" action, is when two users cast CBA votes on each other thereby creating a reciprocal relation between the two. We call a vote a reciprocal vote if the recipient also vote back for an answer authored by the voter. We define in/out reciprocity of user u as the fraction of incoming/outgoing votes that are reciprocal. Figure 5 shows in/out reciprocity as a function of the total number of incoming and outgoing CBA votes of a user. Both the curves are concave, and stabilize around 0.46 for users with large number of votes ­ again indicating potential gaming by heavy users. The number of users involved in such a reciprocal voting pattern is also seen in Figure 6 ­ over 20K users in our dataset are involved in at least 10 reciprocal votes. Considering this pattern as a feature when calibrating CBA votes certainly seems advisable.",null,null

267,"Other Interaction Bias: In the remaining part of the section, we investigate whether CBA votes are independent of previous interaction between the voter and recipient. Our strategy is to use a hypothesis testing framework to analyze whether the null hypothesis -- that CBA voting is independent of previous interaction -- holds true individually for different interaction types. The different types of interaction we consider are the following: Whether one user answered another's question, whether they thumbed up/down each other, and whether they gave CBA/ABA votes to each other (recall that ABA denote asker best-answer).

We select these to be the answerers who have received at least one CBA vote for this question. The randomized version of the X2 statistic is then computed by the following process ­ we again traverse the list of interactions in increasing order of time.

Thus in our paper, we take an indirect approach similar to [12] in using the editorially judged (question, answer) pairs to evaluate user-level expertise. The evaluation hypothesis is that the answers provided by a user with higher expertise should have higher quality. Thus, we rank all the answers to a question using the user-level expertise scores of the answers and use the standard ranking metrics for evaluation.",null,null

This process is repeated 10 times to obtain the predicted scores for all the users and answers. It is important to note that the score of each user is predicted by a model that does not use any label information about that user.,null,null

433,We analyze our results from the following perspectives:,null,null
,,,
434,"Supervised vs Unsupervised: For either expert ranking or answer ranking methods, we have supervised methods (NoCalib and SVA.Full) and unsupervised methods (all others). In Table 4, the best results are highlighted. SVA.Full outperforms all other methods by a large margin. For example, for expert ranking, SVA.Full improves over BAR by 3.8% on NDCG@1, 8.0% on MAP and 38% on Kendall; for answer ranking, SVA.Full improve over BAR+BA by 3.2% on NDCG@1, 16% on MAP and 37% on Kendall. All these improvement are statistically significant. Among the unsupervised methods, BAR is slightly worse than SVM and CWR on NDCG metrics but consistently better on MAP and Kendall metrics. This shows that BAR is a robust baseline to for expert ranking. Also, NoCalib (which uses three types of votes) consistently outperforms BAR. This shows that in CQA systems, considering all types of voting information is helpful, which has been unfortunately ignored in previous work. Our methods are effective to combine all the votes to improve the utility of CQA.",null,null
,,,
435,"Effect of Calibration: We analyze the effect of calibration in Table 4 by comparing NoCalib and SVA.Full. From this table, we can see that SVA.Full is significantly better than NoCalib on most of the metrics, especially for answer ranking. For example, the improvement is 1.5% for NDCG@1 and 4.5% on MAP for the answer ranking. All these improvement are statistically significant at p-value < 0.05. Together with Section 5, this result confirms the existence of bias in the current voting data and shows that vote calibration using our methods is effective.",null,null

We again see SVA and LVA outperform NoCalib. Furthermore, we have the following observations:",null,null

438,"SVA vs LVA: From both figures, we can that SVA (SVA.Full and SVA.Voter) is consistently better than LVA (LVA.Full and LVA.Voter) on both expert ranking and answer ranking.

439,"Full vs Voter: By comparing different set of features, full and",null,null

441,7.2.3 Impact on Heavy Users,null,null

442,"We conducted a stratified study on heavy users by selecting them according to their level of activities in our dataset. Specifically, we set a threshold t and select only those users who have at least t answers in our voting data set. We vary t from 2 to 50 and plot the results in Figure 8. In this figure, the larger t is, the more active the set of users are. Clearly, both figures show that accuracy increases as user activity level increases. This makes intuitive sense because we have more information about heavy users and thus their expertise scores and the quality of the answers they provide can be better estimated. On both expert ranking and answer ranking, our models are consistently better than NoCalib and the relative order of different methods stay the same. Furthermore, for expert ranking, we see a larger margin between models with calibration and NoCalib. This suggests that calibration is more important for heavy users.",null,null

The top 5 sets of features in the order of their importance are: Majority vote, vote spread, self vote, vote reciprocity and voting probability.",null,null
