6,"Result diversification deals with ambiguous or multi-faceted queries by providing documents that cover as many subtopics of a query as possible. Various approaches to subtopic modeling have been proposed. Subtopics have been extracted internally, e.g., from retrieved documents, and externally, e.g., from Web resources such as query logs. Internally modeled subtopics are often implicitly represented, e.g., as latent topics, while externally modeled subtopics are often explicitly represented, e.g., as reformulated queries.",null,null
,,,
7,"We propose a framework that: i) combines both implicitly and explicitly represented subtopics; and ii) allows flexible combination of multiple external resources in a transparent and unified manner. Specifically, we use a random walk based approach to estimate the similarities of the explicit subtopics mined from a number of heterogeneous resources: click logs, anchor text, and web n-grams. We then use these similarities to regularize the latent topics extracted from the top-ranked documents, i.e., the internal (implicit) subtopics. Empirical results show that regularization with explicit subtopics extracted from the right resource leads to improved diversification results, indicating that the proposed regularization with (explicit) external resources forms better (implicit) topic models. Click logs and anchor text are shown to be more effective resources than web n-grams under current experimental settings. Combining resources does not always lead to better results, but achieves a robust performance. This robustness is important for two reasons: it cannot be predicted which resources will be most effective for a given query, and it is not yet known how to reliably determine the optimal model parameters for building implicit topic models.",null,null

16,"Queries in Web search are often short and underspecified [2]. For example, the query ""python"" may refer to a snake as well as a programming language, while the programming language ""python"" covers a wide range of subtopics, such as tutorials, documentations, and downloads. Without knowing the users' actual intent, result diversification deals with such queries by providing documents that cover as many subtopics of a query as possible, so that the average user's ""unhappiness"" is minimized [43].",null,null
,,,
17,"Result diversification has been intensively studied and many diversification algorithms have been proposed [1, 7, 8, 21, 34, 35, 43]. This paper focuses on the discovery of subtopics, also referred to as query intent, facets, and sub-queries in the literature. Subtopics have been extracted internally, e.g., from documents retrieved in response to the query [7, 8, 26, 29], and externally, e.g., from Web resources such as query logs [1, 20, 21, 33, 35]. Internally modelled subtopics are often implicitly represented, e.g., as latent topics or document clusters, while externally modelled subtopics are often explicitly represented, e.g., as reformulated queries1. In particular, there has been much work that exploits explicit subtopics using various types of Web resources. Some take suggested queries from commercial search engines as subtopics of a query [35]; others mine the subtopics from resources such as taxonomies [1, 22], query logs[21, 33], anchor text and Web ngrams [20].",null,null
,,,
18,"While both implicit and explicit subtopics extracted from various Web resources have shown their effectiveness in helping retrieving diverse search results, both topic representations have their limitations. Often, the process of extracting subtopics for a query in a Web resource is focused on finding the subtopics that are relevant to the query, while the relation among the extracted subtopics are not well preserved. For instance, all subtopics discovered in Web resources, e.g., all reformulations of a query, are treated as independent subtopics, regardless the fact that some may be synonymous [21, 35]. In some studies additional steps such as clustering were taken in order to avoid redundancy and find better defined topics [20, 33]. On the other hand, implicitly represented subtopics such as topic models or clusters constructed from document content convey much information about the relations or the structure of the topics present in the documents. Yet, in this case the infor-",null,null

19,"1 Notice that in the context of result diversification, ""implicit"" sometimes refers to diversification methods such as MMR where no actual topics are modeled and only document similarities are used. In this paper, from a topic modeling perspective, we refer to topic models/clusters as implicit topic representations, since no ""labels"" that indicate the content of the topics are assigned, and refer to subtopics represented with external entities such as query suggestions, anchor text, as explicit topic representations, as such entities present the content of the topic explicitly [25].",null,null

23,"Various resources were shown to provide useful information in subtopic mining, sometimes complementary to each other. Click logs have for example been shown an effective resource for subtopic mining in a number of studies [21, 33], but their availability are mainly limited to commercial web engines. Anchor text has been suggested a good proxy for query information, but it is not clear if one should be preferred over the other. Web ngrams are freely available, but may not provide as high quality subtopics for a query as click logs, partially because of the noise introduced by phrases not relevant to the topic of interest. Given a variety of resources, we are interested in a second question:",null,null

24,· Can we combine multiple external sources to help subtopic modeling?,null,null
,,,
25,"We seek a principled way to model the subtopics of a query using multiple sources, including implicitly represented topics extracted from document content, as well as explicitly represented subtopics mined from various Web resources. While combining subtopics from multiple sources can be useful, it is non-trivial. Different resources provide evidence that a subtopic is relevant to a query from different perspectives, which leads to different types of measurements to quantify the similarity between subtopics. We propose a graph based approach to combine explicit subtopics from Web resources. More specifically, we construct local graphs over the subtopics extracted from each single resource. The local graphs are interconnected through subtopics that appear in multiple resources. A measure of subtopic similarity within each local graph is converted into random walk transition probabilities, to obtain a probabilistic framework. Subtopics from different sources are combined in a random walk over the resulting graph, that integrates the various external resources. The result of the random walk defines a probability distribution that encodes the similarity between all subtopics from all resources included in the graph. Given the similarities in the explicit subtopic graphs, we exploit these similarities for regularization during the construction of implicitly defined subtopics from the search result list. Using regularized topic models, the similarities among the explicit subtopics serve as additional constraints, that need to be satisfied when constructing implicit subtopics using document content.",null,null

26,"Our contribution is two-fold. First, we propose a framework that: i) combines both implicitly and explicitly represented subtopics in a principled way; and ii) allows flexible combination of multiple external resources, in a transparent and unified manner. With respect to the proposed framework, an in-depth investigation on its effectiveness as well as limitations are provided. Second, using this framework, we compare the usefulness of various resources (and their combinations) for identifying diversification subtopics. Our findings provide additional evidence for findings in earlier studies on similar themes, and lay a foundation for future work on selecting useful resources for topic modeling.",null,null

,,,
30,"Search result diversification has a long history [5, 7, 10, 23, 37, 43] and a range of diversification approaches have been proposed previously. Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) [7], an early representative diversification method, aims to balance the relevance and diversity of a ranked list. A probabilistic version of MMR has been proposed by Zhai et al. [43], as part of their risk minimization framework. Zhu et al. [44] proposed a ranking method based on random walks in an absorbing Markov chain. By turning ranked items into absorbing states, the method prevents redundant items from receiving a high rank. Yue and Joachims [42] studied a learning algorithm based on a structural Support Vector Machine (SVM) that identifies diverse subsets in a set of documents. Carterette and Chandar [8] proposed a probabilistic model for faceted retrieval, where the facets of a query are modeled with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [4], one of the state-of-the-art topic modeling approaches. In most of these studies, the focus has been on the development of ranking algorithms to produce ranked lists that convey both relevant and diverse information about a query. Only limited effort has been made in mining high quality subtopics for a query, and subtopics were usually modeled based on document content.",null,null
,,,
31,"Recently however, in the context of Web retrieval, a renewed interest in result diversification has emerged. Representative approaches include Intent Aware select (IA-select) [1] and explicit query aspect diversification (xQuAD) [35]. Common to these approaches is the importance of modeling both the subtopics of a query and the relevance of a document with respect to the subtopics of a query. Both works exploited Web resources for subtopic mining. In [1], categories in the Open Directory Project (ODP) taxonomy were used as candidate subtopics, and in [35], query suggestions from Web search engines were used as related subtopics of a query. Recently, Dou et al. [21] has first proposed to combine subtopics mined from multiple sources, including query logs, anchor text, document clusters, and web sites of search results. A common assumption among studies where Web resources are used for subtopic extraction is that the extracted subtopics would be independent. However, these assumptions are most likely not true. Anchor text has for instance been shown to be an effective substitute for query logs in generating query reformulations [19], which indicates that these two resources should be correlated. Moreover, within a single resource such as query logs, various reformulations of a query may be synonyms that refer to the same concept. Our approach does not require to assume the independence among mined subtopics. Conversely, we focus on modeling specifically the similarity or relatedness among the subtopics. In our experiments, we employ IA-select as the primary diversification method (see Section 5.3), to indirectly evaluate the effectiveness of using our approach to model subtopics from multiple sources.",null,null
,,,
32,"A closely related line of research focuses on mining subtopics of a query from various Web resources. Radlinski et al. [33] infer query aspects from query logs, using clicks and session information to model the relations between queries. Dang et al. [20] infer query intent from anchor text and Web ngrams. In both studies, clustering has been applied to the extracted aspects or intents, so that topically redundant or similar entities (queries, anchor text, or Web ngrams) are grouped together. In this paper, we use the same types of Web resources for subtopic mining, and compare their effectiveness in the context of result diversification; although in terms of a query",null,null

Instead of applying clustering, we incorporate the obtained similarities between the extracted subtopics into the topic models constructed using document content. This way we incorporate the similarity between extracted subtopics into the similarity between documents.",null,null
,,,
35,"To compute the similarity between subtopics extracted from different Web resource, we construct graphs over these subtopics and compute their associations using Markov random walks. Similar approaches have been studied in a wide range of topic in the context of query log analysis. For example, Craswell and Szummer [16] studied the usage of Markov random walks over the bipartite graph constructed from click logs for document ranking. Fuxman et al. [22] developed a random walk algorithm for keyword generation from query click graphs. This approach was also adopted in [1] to extract subtopics related to a query from the ODP taxonomy. Ma et al. [30] proposed a query suggestion approach based on Markov random walk and hitting time on the query-URL bipartite graph, aimed at suggesting both semantically relevant and diverse queries to Web users. A recent work that is closely related to ours is the Multi-view random walk (MVR) approach proposed by Cui et al. [18], which aims to combine knowledge from different views of an object in a random walk process. We discuss the differences between their work and ours in detail in Section 3.",null,null

39,"We now detail how we use a Markov random walk based approach to compute the relations between the explicit subtopics of a query in different types of resources. Let R , {ri}Ni,1 be a resource that contains N subtopics related to a query q. Consider for instance a query log that contains N reformulations of q. For a set of resources R ,"" {Rg}, we construct a network consisting of subgraphs on multiple parallel `planes', as shown in Figure 1. First, for each Rg, we construct a weighted graph Gg "","" {Eg; Rg}, where the nodes Rg corresponding to the subtopics in resource g lie on a single plane, and the edges Eg are weighted by the similarity w(ri, rj) between the two nodes. For now, we abstract from the specific way the similarity is defined within a plane, aiming for a method that can be applied generically; details of the graphs created for specific resources are deferred to Section 4. In the second step, we interconnect nodes from different planes Ga and Gb with an extra set of edges, where each edge connects the nodes ri  Ga, rj  Gb that we consider equivalent. Throughout this paper, we consider ri and rj equivalent whenever they have exact matching text representations. While it would be interesting to include non-exact matches, we leave this for future investigation.""",null,null
,,,
40,"For each resource considered, the similarity scores computed may encode different semantics, such that they may not be compared directly across different planes. This is the primary reason why we are not in favor of constructing a single graph that mixes up subtopics from different resources. To resolve this problem, we first transform the similarity scores into 1-step random walk transition probabilities. The only assumption behind the resulting transition probability is that the chance to travel from one subtopic to",null,null

41,"another in a random walk step should depend on the similarity between these subtopics, i.e., the more similar two subtopics are, the more likely the transition from one subtopic to the other can happen.",null,null
,,,
42,"By applying a t-step random walk over the graphs, we expect to find new associations, in particular between subtopics that were not directly connected in a single graph. Further, the random walk sums up the transition probability of all paths of length t between two nodes. The transition probability will be high if there exist many paths from one node to the other. The higher the transition probability the more similar or closely related the two nodes are. During the random walk, the underlying clustering structure of the nodes emerges [36]. If such a clustering structure exists among the nodes, with longer walks, the probability between nodes within a cluster converges to a value higher than that with any node outside the cluster [16]. The probability distribution that arises can therefore be interpreted as a similarity measure that captures the relations between the subtopics in our graphs.",null,null

Not requiring such a correspondence allows for a greater diversity of resources used. Also, MVR defines a 1-step cross-view transition only between corresponding nodes. In principle, although we have not yet studied this alternative setting, our representation allows to consider also a between-plane 1-step transition from a node in one plane to multiple nodes in the other plane, i.e., setting the p1 (j|i) with non-zero values to each pair of nodes i and j.",null,null

The advantage of using local graphs is two-fold: i) it is computationally efficient, and ii) queries that are not relevant to the original query are effectively pruned. In order to collect related subtopics for a query q, we find the queries that share co-clicked documents with q, and for each of these queries further find its coclicked queries.

139,"Table 2 shows an example result of a 5-step random walk on two different graphs, GC and GCA, i.e., the graphs constructed using click logs, and the combination of click logs and anchor text, respectively. We take the query ""defender"" and randomly sample 5 subtopics related to this query from each graph. For each sampled subtopic, we list the 3 most similar subtopics (from left to right), where the similarity is measured by the transition probabilities starting from the sampled subtopics as a result of the random walk. In this example, GC contains 21 subtopics, and GCA contains 118 subtopics. We see that all the subtopics sampled from GC are closely related to the security software ""windows defender"", which indicates that this is a dominant topic in GC . The sample drawn from GCA, on the other hand, covers diverse topics: computer games (space defender, star defender, etc., ), defender industries, windows defender, public defender, and subtopics about the newspapers ""tri-state defender"" and ""chicago defender"". On top of that, if we take a close look at the resulting similarity scores, we see that these scores effectively reflect the semantic relatedness between the subtopics. For example, ""defender industries"" is closely related to ""defender industries inc"", as both can be interpreted as the marine and boat supply company ""Defender Industries Inc.""; it is loosely related to ""defender"", as it is the original query, which is vague and can be interpreted as anything; it is not very likely to be related to ""windows defender"", and correspondingly, a very weak relation is indicated by the similarity score.",null,null

146,"Although the question asks whether ""better topic models"" are formed, it is difficult to access the quality of topic models directly, due to the subjective nature of topics. Instead, by applying the resulting topic models to diversification, we indirectly assess their quality by examining the diversification performance.

Therefore we set t to 5 steps. A typical example is shown in Figure 2, where we use KL-divergence to measure the change of probability distributions over a graph. The graph consists of subtopics from click logs, anchor text and Web ngrams. The box plot is constructed over 150 TREC topics.",null,null

216,"We now discuss the experimental results and their indications to the answers to our research questions. In the following discussion, we will first discuss the behavior of LapPLSA regularized by subtopics from different types of external resources in terms of the general trends shown by the results. We then zoom in to a few specific settings of K and examine the effectiveness of the proposed framework, e.g., highlighting the significance of the observed differences between approaches. Although the number of topics K is an important parameter that has an impact on the diversification result, we do not attempt to optimize it. We do investigate the sensitivity of our results to the estimation of K, when discussing RQ4.",null,null
,,,
217,6.1 Single resources,null,null
,,,
218,"We start with the performance of LapPLSA using single resources. Figure 3 shows the result of IA-select using topic models constructed with the following methods: pLSA without regularization and LapPLSA regularized by similarity matrices generated using click logs, anchor text, and Web ngrams, i.e., LapPLSA_C, LapPLSA_A, and LapPLSA_N, respectively. ""Baseline"" refers to the run without diversification.",null,null
,,,
219,"First, we see that both pLSA and LapPLSA (with different resources) can outperform the baseline. Compared to pLSA, LapPLSA shows more robust performance: diversification with pLSA can underperform the baseline given an improperly set K, while diversification with LapPLSA regularized by the subtopics from an external resource in general outperforms the baseline irrespective of the choice of K. The only exception is the case where K ,"" 2, which is presumably not a sensible choice for K.""",null,null
,,,
220,"Second, judging from Figure 3, the effectiveness of each resource differs on different topic sets. It is noticeable that on topic set 1-50, click logs remarkably outperform the other two resources across all settings of K. A possible explanation is that this topic set is derived from query logs of commercial search engines [12], and therefore the click logs have a relatively high coverage and turn out to be an effective resource for these topics. On topic set 51-100, click logs and anchor text show comparable performance, while Web ngrams are occasionally effective (given a specific settings of K). On topic set 101-150, anchor text generally outperforms click logs. This may due to the fact that the click logs have a very low (< 50%) coverage on this topic set, and that the topic set is rather recent (created in 2011) while the click logs were created in 2006, which may lead to further sparseness: e.g., on average, GA has 17.1 nodes per query, while GC only has 7.6 nodes per query on this topic set. In general, click logs and anchor text seem to be more valuable resources for regularization compared to Web ngrams, across different settings of K. Notice that the Web ngrams are primarily derived from document content, so perhaps their lower effectiveness can be explained by lower influence on pLSA, which also uses document content. To some extent, we can consider the Web ngrams more similar to the document content than click logs and anchor text.",null,null
,,,
221,"As expected, the diversification results of IA-select based on both pLSA and on LapPLSA are sensitive to the change of the parameter K. In particular, there is no clear correlation between the number of clusters and the end-to-end diversification performance, which further suggests the difficulty of finding an optimal K (that would fit for a set of queries). For more detailed analysis on the parameter K, see Section 6.4.",null,null

222,6.2 Combining multiple resources,null,null
,,,
223,"Figure 4(a)-4(c) show the result of combining subtopics from the two relatively more effective resources, namely click logs(GC ) and anchor text (GA). While we only show the combination of these two resources, a similar trend can be observed in the other combinations. We see that combining resources does not always lead to improved diversification results over that of the single resources. Such improvement only happens in a few cases where K is likely to be in an optimal setting for the combined resource GCA, i.e., K , 10 in Figure 4(b) and K ,"" 6 in Figure 4(c). In general, the combination of different resources leads to an """"averaged"""" performance compared to the individual resources that are combined.""",null,null
,,,
224,"This observation is reasonable. Intuitively, combining resources on the one hand increases the coverage of subtopics, e.g., as shown in Table 3, but on the other hand may introduce noise, e.g., if one of the resources contains low quality subtopics. Recall that when constructing the local graphs, their nodes (i.e., subtopics) were selected based on their relation to the original query. In this stage, the relevance of the nodes with respect to the original query was taken into account. However, when combining resources, i.e., during the random walk stage, the goal was to measure the similarities among nodes across resources and no further pruning was conducted. That is, all entries in different graphs were assumed to be equally good. Given our observations on the combined result, a natural step for future work would prune further to prevent low quality resources from deteriorating high quality resources.",null,null

225,6.3 Zoom in on specific settings of K,null,null

226,"Now, let us zoom in to the performance of diversification under specific settings of K. Specifically, we aim to examine the answers to the following questions: 1) are the differences between the diversified result and the baseline significant? and 2) are the differences between the LapPLSA regularized by subtopics from different external resources and the non regularized pLSA significant? For the first question, we consider the setting when K is set to the optimal value for a given topic set. For the second question, since both pLSA and LapPLSA are sensitive to K, we set K to the optimal value for each query, so that the impact of K is reduced to the minimum. Note that here by saying ""optimal"", we mean the best K in the range of [2, 10] in terms of -nDCG@20.",null,null

227,"Table 4 and Table 5 show the results with respect to the first and the second questions, respectively.",null,null
,,,
228,"From Table 4 we see that with a proper setting of K, in most cases, diversification with pLSA as well as with LapPLSA significantly outperforms the baseline. Again, the effectiveness of each individual resource differs for the three topic sets. For topics 1-50, regularization with click logs is most effective, while regularization with anchor text and with Web ngrams fails to have significant improvement over the baseline. On topic set 51-100, while pLSA based diversification does not result in significant improvement over the baseline in terms of both ERR-IA@20 and -nDCG@20, all LapPLSA based runs show significant improvement in terms of at least one of the two measures. On topic set 101150, only the run with LapPLSA using click logs does not achieve significant improvement over the baseline, all others do.",null,null

229,"Table 5 shows that LapPLSA regularized with subtopics from external resources does not always lead to significant improvement over pLSA. However, on each of the three topic sets, at least one resource exists that, when used for regularization, outperforms pLSA significantly. Again, regularization with click logs is shown to be most effective, on topic set 1-50. On topic set 51-100, except click logs, regularization with one of the resources or their combinations results in significant improvement over the non-regularized pLSA.",null,null

310,"Table 6 shows the result. Each sample contains 9 observations, i.e., for K ,"" 2, ..., 10. W is the rank sum statistics , where a larger W indicates a more extreme difference between the two samples. Two observations stand out. First, in all cases but three(GAN on topics 1-50, GN on topic 51-100, and GC on 101-150), the differences between pLSA and LapPLSA are significant with a p-value < 0.05. That is, with a random setting of K, LapPLSA regularized with external resources tends to outperform non-regularized pLSA. Second, in most cases, the W value of those combined resources are in between (occasionally above) the resources that are combined. This is consistent with the observation made in Section 6.2. Further, compared to GC and GA, GN has a relatively lower W on all three topic sets, which suggests that with a random K, LapPLSA regularized with GN is less likely to improve over pLSA compared to GA and GC .""",null,null

312,We conclude the experimental analysis by relating our findings to the research questions formulated before (See Section 5.1).,null,null

314,"With respect to RQ2, we find that different resources are effective on different topic sets. Futher, based on the observation in Figure 3 and the results discussed in Section 6.4, we conclude that the effectiveness of Web ngrams is the least robust, or more sensitive to the setting of K compared to anchor text and click logs. As mentioned before, we suspect that the Web ngrams are more similar to the document content than truly external resources, which could explain the observed difference.",null,null

315,"For RQ3, we find that combining resources does not always improve the diversification result. The combined resource usually results in a diversification performance in between that of the individual resources combined.",null,null

328,7. CONCLUSION,null,null
,,,
329,"We proposed Multi-source Subtopics (MSS), a framework for subtopic modeling that i) uses a random walk based approach to combine and estimate the similarity between subtopics extracted from multiple Web sources, and ii) uses the obtained similarity relations to regularize topic models constructed using document content. MSS combines subtopics from multiple resources transparently, unifying implicit and explicit representations of subtopics.",null,null
,,,
330,"We have demonstrated how the application of this framework in the context of search result diversification allows us to flexibly combine, analyze and compare subtopics extracted from different resources. Empirical results show that topic models regularized by the topical information extracted from external resources lead to improved and more robust diversification results, supporting our claim that better topic models are formed. Among the Web resources employed in our experiments, anchor text and click logs were shown to be generally more effective than Web ngrams. However, the effectiveness of a resource also depends on the properties of a specific query, and especially whether a resource contains subtopic information related to a query at all. Combining multiple resources could alleviate lack of coverage, but in our current setup leads to a diversification performance in between that of the resources that are combined.",null,null
,,,
331,"A number of directions are left to be explored in the future. First of all, there is room to improve our method by exploring how to weigh resources by their (expected) quality for a given query. More resources can be analyzed, for example derived from social bookmarking sites, and more sophisticated ways of parameter optimization should be considered. Second, a component wise evaluation may improve our understanding beyond observations on the diversification pipeline as a whole. Hereto, we need to develop a method to evaluate the quality of the constructed subtopics directly through human assessment. This may be especially useful to improve our understanding of the features that make an external resource a good one for a given query. Finally, perhaps the strength of the external resources is not yet exploited in full when we only use them to regularize pLSA. An alternative could be to integrate implicit topics as nodes in the multi-plane random walks, and thus treat both types of topic representations more equally.",null,null
