5,"Push notifications from social media provide a method to keep up-to-date on topics of personal interest. To be effective, notifications must achieve a balance between pushing too much and pushing too little. Push too little and the user misses important updates; push too much and the user is overwhelmed by unwanted information. Using data from the TREC 2015 Microblog track, we explore simple dynamic emission strategies for microblog push notifications. The key to effective notifications lies in establishing and maintaining appropriate thresholds for pushing updates. We explore and evaluate multiple threshold setting strategies, including purely static thresholds, dynamic thresholds without user feedback, and dynamic thresholds with daily feedback. Our best technique takes advantage of daily feedback in a simple yet effective manner, achieving the best known result reported in the literature to date.",null,null
6,1. INTRODUCTION,null,null
7,"Filtering topical events from social media streams, such as Twitter, provides a means for users to keep up-to-date on topics of interest to them. If care is taken, these updates may even be pushed directly to the user through notifications on mobile devices or desktops. However, for push notifications to be successful, the user must be given means to control the frequency and volume of updates, avoiding indiscriminate and unwanted notifications. This frequency and volume depends both on the interests of the user, with topics of greater interest updated in greater volume, and on the topics themselves, with some topics naturally receiving updates more frequently than others.",null,null

14,"The TREC Microblog tracks provide an experimental forum for research groups working in this area. In 2015, the track [4] required participating groups to monitor the live ""spritzer"" stream provided by Twitter over a period of ten days in July, selecting tweets relevant to 225 pre-defined interest profiles, each expressed through statements modeled after TREC ad hoc topics. Each tweet returned by participating systems was accompanied by the clock time at which the system would have pushed it to the user. This information was then used by the track organizers to compute various official evaluation measures for a subset of 51 interest profiles. The evaluation measures considered both the relevance of selected tweets and the time at which they were putatively pushed. In addition, the measures accounted for retweets, near-duplicate tweets, and other redundancies, reflecting an expectation that a user would not want to receive notifications about the same thing over and over again.",null,null
15,"Along with this mobile notification scenario (called ""scenario A"") the evaluation supported a daily digest scenario (called ""scenario B""). At the end of each of the ten days, participating systems returned a ranked list of tweets from that day, just as if a user was sent a summary of the day's events by email. Standard evaluation measures for ranked retrieval may be applied, provided that they also appropriately account for redundant content.",null,null
16,"To achieve good results for scenario A, systems must successfully address three requirements implicit in the task:",null,null
17,"1. A requirement to score individual tweets with respect to relevance. As a simplification, the evaluation focused on topical relevance. Social signals, such as the prominence of the source or its connection to the user, were not considered, so that the relevance of a tweet is primarily determined by its content.",null,null
18,"2. A requirement for novelty, so that the system does not push redundant information. This requirement was operationalized by the assessors considering tweets chronologically: if two textually similar tweets arrive at different times, the later tweet is considered redundant if it does not contain substantive information beyond that found in the earlier tweet [9]. Again, only tweet content is considered, so that a duplicate tweet from a more prominent or authoritative source would still be considered redundant.",null,null
19,1009,null,null
20,"3. A requirement to avoid pushing non-relevant information altogether. The evaluation measures for scenario A explicitly rewarded systems that avoided pushing non-relevant information. Thus, appropriate selection of thresholds was critical to success. In some cases, the ideal response for a given day was to push nothing, and the ""empty"" strategy of never pushing anything formed a challenging baseline that many systems failed to beat.",null,null
21,"Since the first two requirements are inherent in any ranking task, we focus on the third requirement. After demonstrating the impact of ignoring the third requirement, we consider various strategies for establishing and maintaining thresholds for pushing tweets. We examine strategies under two assumptions: with and without user feedback. When feedback is not available, thresholds are established from historical information. When feedback is provided, it is limited to once-per-day judgments based on the scenario B output. Of particular importance is the establishment of a global score threshold, applied across all topics in the absence of feedback. Our best technique takes advantage of daily feedback in a simple yet effective manner, achieving the best known result reported in the literature to date.",null,null
22,2. RELATED WORK,null,null
23,"Filtering has been a longstanding subject for information retrieval research. Earlier work on Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) investigated algorithms for the discovery of new topics and maintaining awareness when these topics reappear in newswire streams or broadcast news [2]. Experimental results from TREC from the mid-1990s to early2000s indicated that simple IR techniques can achieve high quality results in TDT domains [1, 3, 10, 11]. For example, Allan et al. [1] used the most common words from 1 to 16 training stories to generate short queries which were compared to documents using TF-IDF based similarity.",null,null
24,"More recently, researchers have examined filtering and tracking problems in the context of social media. However, Twitter introduces several issues not present in previous topic tracking tasks, especially in relation to tweets. In particular, tweets have a maximum length of 140 characters and this length limitation implies that meaningful words rarely occur more than once, suggesting that TF-IDF weighting schemes may be less useful. Lin et al. [5] investigated the use of four language modeling smoothing techniques to filter tweets, mitigating issues with sparse terms, i.e., the zero-probability problem. Zhao and Tajima [12] framed a retweet recommendation problem as a multiplechoice secretary problem. They examined Twitter ""portal accounts"", which retweet selected tweets for their followers, and considered a number of strategies for tweet selection. They proposed and compared a number of online and nearonline decision methods, including a history-based threshold algorithm, a stochastic threshold algorithm, a time-interval algorithm, and an ""every k-tweets"" algorithm.",null,null

In addition to the tweet ids, the push time was recorded for each tweet, indicating the time the system decided to push the notification. After all experimental runs were submitted to the track organizers, 51 of the interest profiles were selected for judging. Tweets were pooled and judged on a three-point scale. In evaluating a run, a tweet was considered redundant, providing no gain, if it did not contain substantial new information not found in previously pushed tweets [9].",null,null

36,"ELG has an interesting discontinuity when a system decides not to push anything. For some topics on some days, when no relevant tweets appear in the stream, this is the correct action. On such days, a system pushing any tweet receives a score of zero (since none can possibly be relevant). To reward systems that push nothing on such days, the value of ELG is defined to be one. On the other hand, for systems that push nothing on days when relevant tweets appear in the stream, the value of ELG is defined to be zero. Since no relevant tweets appeared for many topics on many days, the ""empty"" strategy of never pushing anything receives a nonzero ELG score. Indeed, this strategy forms a challenging baseline which many participating systems failed to beat.",null,null

43,"For matching against the tweet stream, titles were tokenized by splitting on space and punctuation, and stopwords were removed.

This was accomplished by querying Twitter's own search engine with title terms at the beginning of each day and extracting the top terms using pointwise KL-divergence [6, 8].",null,null
44,"For relevance scoring, we applied a simple matching formula developed through pilot testing. Given the short length of tweets, many ""standard"" features such as query term frequency appear to have limited value.

57,"Thresholding. Thresholds for pushing tweets were based on the relevance score in Equation (2). Each day, a threshold is selected, and only tweets with scores greater than or equal to the threshold are considered for delivery.

58,"Because of its simplicity, Equation (2) has the interesting property that reasonable thresholds are the same across all queries.

87,5. FEEDBACK STRATEGIES,null,null
88,"Under scenario B, participants submitted a ranked list of tweets for each topic for each day, providing a daily digest of events for the hypothetical user. Building on the baseline system described above, we use each day's digest to provide relevance feedback for determining thresholds for the following day. While in reality each system saved a ranked list during each day of the evaluation period for later submission, and thus system results were not judged until the evaluation concluded, here we assume that relevance information is provided at the end of each day and available for immediate use. We imagine a user interacting with the results once per day, providing feedback as a way of adjusting the filter for the next day. While in practice this daily interaction might be too onerous, the results provide a sense of what gains could be achieved with ongoing feedback.",null,null
89,"For the feedback strategies described below, we used our official scenario B run submitted to TREC 2015 as the daily digest--this ensured that all tweets have relevance judgments. Our method of relevance scoring, Equation (2), often assigns the same score to several tweets. We use the term ""score block"" to denote a set of tweets with the same score. Accordingly, we say that for a score si, it has a corresponding score block SBi. To determine a dynamic threshold using relevance feedback, we begin by combining all feedback received into a single list of score blocks. At the end of day one for a particular topic, we have 10 tweets worth of feedback, on day two, 20 tweets worth, and so on.",null,null

128,"Simple techniques for content matching and novelty can achieve good effectiveness for microblog filtering, provided that care is taken to set appropriate thresholds to avoid pushing non-relevant information.

129,"the optimal threshold could be determined for each topic at the beginning of each day, i.e., the oracle with an ELG of 0.4709. However, we significantly improve upon our already highly-effective baseline (already the best automatic run at TREC 2015). In fact, our technique achieves the best known result reported in the literature to date, including manual runs. Our experiments highlight the importance of proper threshold setting, and demonstrate that systems can automatically set appropriate thresholds using simple yet effective feedback techniques. While dynamic thresholds can be set from the tweets of previous days without feedback, such a strategy provides little value, at least with the simple technique we tried.",null,null
130,"Our experiments show that dynamic thresholding using feedback has the potential to produce substantial and significant gains. While we have explored only one approach to this idea, through end-of-day relevance judgments, we can imagine more realistic interfaces, which might for example allow incremental judgments as tweets are pushed. In addition, we hope to incorporate social signals and other noncontent features into the relevance and novelty components of our system, with the goal of retaining our simple approach to thresholding, while improving overall effectiveness.",null,null
