8,ABSTRACT,null,null
9,"Offline evaluation of information retrieval systems typically focuses on a single effectiveness measure that models the utility for a typical user. Such a measure usually combines a behavior-based rank discount with a notion of document utility that captures the single relevance criterion of topicality. However, for individual users relevance criteria such as credibility, reputability or readability can strongly impact the utility. Also, for different information needs the utility can be a different mixture of these criteria. Because of the focus on single metrics, offline optimization of IR systems does not account for different preferences in balancing relevance criteria.",null,null
10,"We propose to mitigate this by viewing multiple relevance criteria as objectives and learning a set of rankers that provide different tradeoffs w.r.t. these objectives. We model document utility within a gainbased evaluation framework as a weighted combination of relevance criteria. Using the learned set, we are able to make an informed decision based on the values of the rankers and a preference w.r.t. the relevance criteria. On a dataset annotated for readability and a web search dataset annotated for sub-topic relevance we demonstrate how trade-offs between can be made explicit. We show that there are different available trade-offs between relevance criteria.",null,null

13,1. INTRODUCTION,null,null
14,"The primary goal of information retrieval (IR) systems is to satisfy the information need of a user. Search engines today are fairly successful in finding topically relevant pages. To achieve this most search engines are optimized to rank documents based on their topical relevance to the query. In an offline optimization setting relevance is typically determined by experts, and evaluated with utility-based metrics such as nDCG, which tends to focus on optimizing a single aspect of utility. In online optimization, feedback is collected implicitly for all relevance criteria. However, this approach may ignore differences between individual users and information",null,null

E.g., users that have limited vocabularies (e.g., children) can benefit from search results optimized for their reading level. When people look for medical information on the web they would benefit from accurate and reliable information, more so than when looking for information on a Star Wars movie.",null,null
19,"Utility depends on many factors aside from topicality; criteria such as credibility, reputability and readability are also important [14]. While their importance is typically secondary to topicality, there clearly is a benefit in many use cases. A learning to rank approach [16] can be used to learn an optimal ranker for a specified weighted preference over criteria. Similarly, data fusion techniques can combine ranked lists that are optimized for a certain notion of utility. But what if we want to optimize for multiple criteria, without knowing their relative importance beforehand? For instance, how should we balance relevance and readability if we do not know who our user will be? Or relevance and sub-topic relevance?",null,null
20,"We draw inspiration from multi-objective optimization techniques to answer these questions, i.e., to find a set of rankers for which each solution is optimal for a different trade-off in the relevance criteria. We combine the multi-objective technique Optimistic Linear Support (OLS) [12] with multiple utility-based metrics in a learning-to-rank setting. We consider two scenarios with two relevance criteria for which we optimize a set of rankers. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, one annotated for relevance and readability, and one annotated for relevance and diversity. To learn our rankers we apply dueling bandit gradient descent with a point-wise ranking function. To optimize for diversity we subsequently apply MMR and cluster-based ranking.",null,null
21,2. BACKGROUND,null,null
22,"The concept of relevance is core to IR and a much debated subject. Park [9] gives an extensive analysis on the nature of relevance in IR, and argues that relevance is intrinsically related to the selection process by the user. Cooper [4] states that each query could represent a set of specific questions as part of the information need, where documents are relevant if they provide an answer to one of these specific questions. Schamber [14] identifies major criterion groups for relevance: aboutness, currency, availability, clarity and credibility. There is a general trend that relevance cannot be attributed to just one factor such as topicality, but is multi-factored [9].",null,null
23,"Many metrics have been proposed to measure the effectiveness of an IR system; we focus on metrics based on the concept of utility [2, 4]. The utility of an IR system depends on all factors that determine the usefulness for each specific user. Cooper [4] defines utility as ""A catch all concept involving not only topic relatedness",null,null

140,"Convex coverage set. Because each criterion contributes positively to the scalarization function, and we are interested in the relative importance of each criterion, we can assume that w is a positive vector that sums to 1 in order to determine a coverage set. A coverage set that covers all possible linear scalarizations is called a convex coverage set (CCS) [11]. To compute the (approximate) CCS, we build on the Optimistic Linear Support (OLS) framework for multi-objective optimization [12]. Fig. 2 illustrates the OLS procedure; OLS computes a CCS by solving a multi-objective problem as a series of single-objective problems, i.e., problems that are scalarized using different w. At each iteration, OLS tries to find a new ranker, thereby incrementally building a CCS. We can use existing single-objective optimization techniques to find rankers for a given w. We use Dueling Bandit Gradient Descent (DBGD) [16].",null,null

144,"i.e., the scalarized value function is the convex upper surface of the vectors in Fig. 2. OLS selects the next w from the corner weights of VS(w), i.e., those w where VS(w) changes slope. In Fig. 2 the corner weights evaluated in that iteration are indicated by the blue vertical lines. The maximal possible improvement in scalarized value on the partial CCS is indicated by the dashed lines above VS(w). Once it reaches a corner weight, OLS is provably optimal as long as the single-objective method it employs to solve the scalarized problems is exact [12]. In practice, exact singleobjective subroutines are not required; we can safely use DBGD, but with lesser guarantees of the optimality of the solution [13].",null,null
145,"Reuse and iterated search scheme. A limitation of applying standard OLS is that for every corner weight DBGD needs to be run. This can be expensive, depending on the size of the dataset. However, this can be mitigated by hot-starting the single-objective optimization algorithm with parts of previously found solutions (following [13]). For each new corner weight, we multi-start DBGD, starting from the rankers that were found at the 3 closest corner weights so far. It is possible that DBGD does not find a new best",null,null

149,"To demonstrate how multi-objective optimization for balancing multiple relevance criteria works in practice, we perform experiments on two datasets: (i) balancing readability and topical relevance in a health setting (CLEF eHealth 2015 task 2 [8]), and (ii) balancing diversity and topical relevance in a web search dataset annotated for sub-topic relevance (TREC 2012 Web Track diversity task).

It is composed of 5 training queries and 67 test queries; annotations are provided for relevance only for the training queries, and both relevance and understandability for the test queries. As the extra understandability annotations are required to optimize for both relevance and understandability at the same time we only use the test set queries for optimization. To measure readability document text is extracted using boilerpipe [6]. Since simple readability metrics do not correlate well with actual readability in the medical domain [15], another approach to readability is required. We compiled a list of medical terms and counted their occurrences. This list was taken from an English Wikipedia page, for which all words contained in the 20k English word list from the Google Trillion Word Corpus were filtered out.1 Using this feature, and, additionally, the Coleman-Liau index, Gunning fog index, and document length, we trained an SVM to predict the understandability score. For the CLEF eHealth 2015 task 2 the usual metrics are RBP, uRBP and uRBPgr. In preliminary experiments we found a strong correlation between RBP and uRBP, like [17].

250,"We demonstrated how to optimize rankings for multiple objectives by proposing a multi-objective approach based on optimistic linear support and DBGD for learning to rank. Because DBGD may get stuck in a local minimum we proposed an iterated local search schema for DBGD, and reuse of rankers inside OLS in order to make our algorithm more efficient. Using this approach, we have found multiple optimal rankers on the CLEF eHealth 2015 task 2 and on the TREC diversity task that offer different trade-offs w.r.t. different relevance criteria. These multiple optimal rankers are more flexible than a one-size-fits-all ranker produced by a standard learning to rank approach, and our work therefore forms an important step for flexibly optimizing search when multiple criteria are in play.",null,null
251,"As to future work, one important issue is exposing different solutions to the user, or using different solutions to select the desired one. Exposing the user to multiple solutions can be done using additional",null,null
252,"user interface elements, or based on profiling of the user or adapting per query. The number of user interface controls provided in generic search engines is very minimal; specialized search engines are more likely to benefit from optimizing their controls based on these multiobjective criteria. Future work may also investigate what a good scalarization function is, as others may exist and be more suited, and which metrics are more suitable for linear combination. Many current evaluation metrics are highly correlated with relevance and as such may not always provide the flexibility to get a large CCS.",null,null
