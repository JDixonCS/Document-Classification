37,1 INTRODUCTION,,
,,,
38,"Topic diculty, dened as the average eectiveness of a set of systems on a topic [9, 10], is a well-studied problem in the IR literature. It is loosely related to the problem of Query Performance Prediction",,

42,"RQ3. What is the eect of system components on topic diculty? RQ4. What is the relative eect of choosing dierent systems, cor-",,
,,,

,,,
44,2 RELATED WORK,,
,,,
45,"A body of related work focuses on studying factors that aect system eectiveness, such as topic composition, collection, and system components. Sanderson et al. [11] investigated the eect of splitting a TREC collection into sub-collections based on system eectiveness, and identied several interesting sub-collection effects induced by the splits. Banks et al. [1] provided an overview of methods that can be applied to analyze the performance of IR systems on TREC collections and its relation to topics, collections and other factors. One common statistical tool used for this problem is the Analysis of Variance",,

633,4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK,,
,,,
634,"This is the rst study that specically addresses topic diculty in a systematic way: we use dierent corpora, not just sub-corpora; we run the same set of systems across dierent datasets; and we rely on datasets featuring common topics. To do so, we exploit the topic overlap between C17 and R04 with previous collections, and we supplement our analysis using a comprehensive set of unocial but reproducible systems.",,

678,We nd that topic diculty is aected by the document corpora,,

681,"eect, although not so large. Finally, we see a smaller eect of",,

683,few limited cases. Although the standard ANOVA analysis shows a,,
