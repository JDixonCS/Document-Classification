22,1 INTRODUCTION,null,null
,,,
23,"A 68% rise in the use of social networking sites since 2005 [15] has introduced an abundance of real-time information online. This has enabled new ways for the public to contact response agencies [4], and grants those in the Emergency Management sector a new means of accessing potentially life-saving information. With a threefold increase in natural disasters over the past 35 years [11], it is extremely important that emergency response agencies have the tools available to ensure that they can monitor social media streams",null,null

,,,
27,"Data posted on social media platforms regarding a disaster or world events could potentially provide a wide range of valuable information to emergency response services. For example, responding to cries for help, accessing first-hand observations or simply gaining an insight into public opinions could provide an addedvalue to these agencies. However, with the wealth of information now available, it is critical that the data can be easily visualised and navigated, ensuring that emergency services can quickly find and act upon key information.",null,null
,,,
28,"There also lies potential in the connection of volunteers with formal emergency response officers during crisis situations. Systems designed to assist emergencies services during crises face typically a number of challenges, including a lack of coordination and communication between the officers and other formal entities as well as an unwillingness to engage and form relationships with digital volunteer groups [19]. A successful connection with both physical and digital volunteers could indeed aid response efforts immensely, with a wealth of potential skills and resources becoming available [20].",null,null
,,,
29,"A range of systems have been developed in the past with the goal to support emergency response efforts during disasters [4]. These systems, however, have had little impact on the sector. It has been found that reasons behind this include the insufficient training of personnel, which require time to make adequate use of the platforms, the lack of guidelines for their use, and apprehension over social media trustworthiness [9].",null,null
,,,
30,"In this paper, we propose a new system, Event Tracker, which aims to support the monitoring and management of events during disasters and crisis situations. The system intends to support three primary tiers of users - emergency response officers and their teams; physical and digital volunteers; as well as the victims during the crisis. Indeed, we argue that emergency response agencies should be given the tools to navigate large volumes of social media data with ease, supported by functionalities such actionable information feeds and criticality estimation. Moreover, volunteers should be able to provide information directly to these response agencies, either using their first-person knowledge of the situation, or aiding the data navigation and highlighting specific information and relevant details. Finally, victims during a disaster should be able to straightforwardly access advice and information from emergency services, ensuring that they are equipped with up-to-date information that could lead to their safety.",null,null

40,"Finding Relevant Information: A core function of any crisis management solution is getting key information to the right people. This is operationalised either via volunteer efforts [6] or through automatic technologies [18] for categorising and prioritising reports. Indeed, a survey [5] of approaches identified eight dimensions of categorisation, namely: by information provided/contained; fact vs. subjective vs. emotional content; by information source; by credibility; by time; by location; by embedded links; or by environmental relevance",null,null
,,,
41,"Crisis Content Processing and TREC-IS: As discussed above, a range of automatic technologies to support crisis management have previously been proposed. However, individually they have had little impact on crisis management as a whole [16]. One reason for this lack of impact is data quality [10]. To avoid a similar fate, Event Tracker's automatic content categorisation service targets a crisis ontology being maintained by an active initiative, namely TREC Incident Streams",Y,TREC-IS
,,,
42,"Related Systems: Before discussing the design and architecture of Event Tracker, it is worth highlighting some related systems that we either build upon or learn from. First, EAIMS [13], was a prototype crisis management system that aimed at exploiting social media data to provide real-time detection of emergency events",null,null
,,,
43,,null,null
,,,
44,"using only pre-trained models can lead to low accuracy. Currently, Event Tracker relies on pre-trained classification models, however its underlying microservice architecture is flexible and allows for the integration of additional services like AIDR. Finally, Twitcident is another web-based system for filtering and analysing social media data on real-world incidents, such as disasters. Similar to EAIMS, Twitcident [1] provides incident detection and search technologies, enabling emergency services to filter data to aid their response efforts. However, a relatively recent study showed that Twitcident did not provide much value to response agencies in practice, as it could not provide early warnings regarding critical information [3]. For this reason, Event Tracker integrates criticality estimation tools to provide real-time reporting of crucial information.",null,null
,,,
45,3 EVENT TRACKER ARCHITECTURE,null,null
,,,
46,"As argued earlier, the goal of Event Tracker is to provide an integrated platform that provides both automated low-latency ingestion and augmentation of report streams",null,null
,,,
47,"As such, Event Tracker uses a flexible architecture as illustrated in Figure 2. The lowest ingestion layer provides multi-stream integration, using a common data back-end to [13]. Above this sits the augmentation layer, which enables modular and scalable integration of report tagging microservices",null,null
,,,
48,4 KEY FUNCTIONALITIES,null,null
,,,
49,"Event Tracker integrates a number of functionalities following the design vision discussed earlier. Below, we summarise these main functionalities.",null,null
,,,
50,"Generating Actionable Information Feeds: As discussed above, getting key information to the right people is crucial for a successful crisis management system, and one of the main reasons why previous systems have failed. Event Tracker combats this by providing multiple actionable information feeds through user dashboards, each of which is designed with a different intention of the value it can provide to the response agencies.

106,"answered quickly, increasing for example the likelihood that a victim could be assisted in time. Event Tracker aims to accomplish this by also making use of the TREC-IS initiative to provide real-time identification of critical information. Fast classification and text processing technologies are exploited to immediately label incoming messages with a criticality score of low, medium, high, or critical, which can then be displayed alongside Tweets on a user's dashboard. Continuous push notifications servicing is also harnessed by Event Tracker to populate the Critical Feed, pictured in Figure 1",Y,TREC-IS

116,"response agencies. The module could be extended in the future to display the locations of other reports, to improve data management. Next, we describe the On-request information access functionality. Making use of the Terrier search engine [14], Event Tracker allows users to explore the collected data with ease. New feeds are created on the user's dashboard, enabling multiple searches to run concurrently. For example, emergency response agencies can make use of this feature to discover reports relating to specific queries, such as `fire'.",null,null

118,5 ILLUSTRATIVE USE CASES,null,null
,,,
119,"Focussing on multiple types of users during a crisis event, Event Tracker has several use cases. To illustrate the working of Event Tracker, let's consider two possible user cases. In the first use case, consider an emergency response officer, who uses the system to view all the actionable information feeds and navigate the incoming reports of data. During a simulation of the 2013 Australia Bushfire crisis, Event Tracker marked the Tweet ""Horrid emergency unfolding at #faulconbridge - fire is 50m behind #springwood shs - near hundreds of homes, norman lindsay gallery #nswfires"" as a high criticality emerging threat. Had Event Tracker been deployed over this event, a response officer accessing this report could have contributed an effective response. During an event, these officers may be monitoring multiple communication channels [17], which may lead to sporadic focus on each of the information feeds. As a consequence, some important information about tnhe event might be missed. Instead, with Event Tracker, the criticality alerting component would notify the user with any new reports that are predicted to be of vital importance, ensuring that the end-user can act quickly and efficiently. As a second case, consider a volunteer on the ground during a disaster. They could make use of Event Tracker to coordinate with response agencies to ensure that they are providing the best help they can. They can also make reports for the response agencies, to bring any significant information they possess to the attention of the response officers.",null,null
,,,
120,6 CONCLUSIONS,null,null
,,,
121,"In this paper, we have presented Event Tracker, a modular and extensible prototype system designed to support the monitoring",null,null
,,,
122,,null,null
,,,
123,"and management of events during crisis situations. The system leverages a flexible architecture, which is designed for low latency, and high-volume streams of data to provide functionalities such as actionable information feeds and criticality alerting. Event Tracker also enables the communication between various emergency response agencies and volunteers, and provides additional functionalities such as crisis mapping and on-request information access. In the short term, we aim to make Event Tracker available to the participants of the TREC-IS track. In particular, due to the modular augmentation layer Event Tracker is built upon, microservices such as those proposed by different groups participating to the TREC-IS track could be integrated and deployed, enabling different demonstrations to the end-users, whereby the corresponding outcomes and effectiveness of different technologies can be evaluated and further investigated.",Y,TREC-IS
