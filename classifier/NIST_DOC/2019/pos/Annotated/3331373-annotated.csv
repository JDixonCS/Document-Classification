30,"Passage retrieval, present in literature for decades [10], is the task of retrieving only portions of documents, i.e., passages, relevant to a particular information need. At times, passage retrieval is viewed as an intermediate step in other information retrieval tasks, e.g., question answering and summarization.",null,null
,,,
31,"Believing that certain passages pose greater relevance to a given query, we investigate how such relevance can be exploited to improve retrieval on a particular domain, specifically news retrieval. We differ from both existing passage retrieval [10] and passage detection [6] efforts, where the aim is to either retrieve only highly relevant passages or detect unrelated injected passages from within documents, respectively. In contrast, our goal is not to answer a query by retrieving single passages or detect injected unrelated passages, but to focus on improving the effectiveness of a retrieval",null,null

36,"The exploitation of term positions in Information Retrieval applications is common. One of the most notable examples related to our work is the BM25F weighting model [9], where term statistics are computed separately for the different fields that make up a document",null,null
,,,
37,"Term positions are also exploited in the news context for news summarization and classification tasks [2­4]. In news recommendation, the first few sentences and the article title are known to boost the performance of recommender systems. The performance of the system can be further improved by considering the rest of the document, and the best results can be observed when using the whole article text, as in our approach [1, 12]. This result suggests that although news articles tend to concentrate relevant content in the beginning, this does not necessarily imply that the remaining sections of the text can be ignored without hindering accuracy. By making the best of these two observations, we analyze the distribution of the occurrences of highly relevant terms and note that news documents belonging to different collections are consistently characterized by areas with different densities of highly relevant terms. We thus exploit this fact to improve a classical IR weighting model such as BM25. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first contribution in this direction exploiting the in-document distributions of impactful terms within news documents in the BM25 weighting function.",null,null

A slightly different result is achieved for the Signal and RCV1 datasets, where the best performing method results to be BM25P5. Indeed, on these collections, BM25P5, BM25P10 and BM25P15 always show statistically significant improvements w.r.t. BM25 with p < 0.01 for   10.",Y,Aquaint

When  = 10, the average value of the scaled weights wi is equal to 1, i.e., the value of  divided by the number of passages. When  < 10, the average value of the scaled weights wi becomes lesser than 1, thus penalizing the contribution of t fP with respect to the document length normalization in the denominator of Eq.(1). Conversely, the mean of the weights is greater than or equal to 1 when   10, and the initial and final passages of the news can get larger weights than the others passages. The best performing setting is BM25P10",Y,BM25P10
