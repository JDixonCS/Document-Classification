,,,
34,"To provide the theoretical underpinnings we draw upon the C/W/L framework proposed by Moffat et al. [8]. This framework provides a standardised and intuitive way to encode a wide range of metrics, and enables reporting of not just Expected Utility per item inspected, the rate at which gain is acquired, but also the related measurements of Expected Total Utility, the gain accumulated from the whole list; Expected Cost per item inspected; Expected Total Cost, the cost incurred in examining the results list; and Expected Depth, the number of items a searcher examines given the user model",null,null

Different choices of C = Ci  then reflect different beliefs about user behaviour and hence define different metrics. A vector of weights W = Wi  can be derived from C, where Wi is an assessment of the expected proportion of user attention directed at the item at rank i.

53,"Fundamentally, the C/W/L framework generates a wide range of measurements regarding the predicted user interactions with the ranked list of search results; and hence, conversely, allows for a wide range of observational information to be used to derive metrics that relate to user behaviour, and thus to useful measurement.",null,null

54,"2 TOOLKIT, APP AND NOTEBOOKS",null,null
,,,
55,"Toolkit. cwl_eval defines three core classes. First, the Ranking class is minimally composed of two ordered lists representing the gains and costs of the items returned from the search. Attributes such as total gain and total relevant items are calculated from these two lists. The ranking is then passed to the CWLRuler, which is composed of a number of CWLMetrics; or directly to a single CWLMetric. The latter produces the measurements.",Y,cwl_eval
,,,
56,"The heart of the toolkit is the CWLMetric class, which is used as the basis of different measures. It requires the definition of the C, W and/or L vectors.",null,null
,,,
57,Graded Gain Values. Järvelin and Kekäläinen [3] make use of graded gains and non-binary relevance judgements; Moffat and Zobel [5] similarly allow fractional utility. cwl_eval also allows fractional gains to be input as part of a standard TREC qrels file.,Y,TREC
,,,
58,"Residuals. In their description of RBP Moffat and Zobel [5] introduce the notion of residuals, the score uncertainty introduced by unjudged documents. In an ideal evaluation, all documents in the ranking would have associated gain values, and metric score measurements would be precise. Howevere, in most practical experimentation only a small subset of the documents in the ranking have been judged. The standard",null,null
,,,
59,"In particular, high residual values indicate an experimental context in which there might be non-trivial imprecision in the measured values, with further relevance judgements being the only way to be sure whether that is in fact the case. Note that residuals should not be thought of as being confidence intervals, or as having any statistical basis. Their sole purpose is to provide a bounding range on the eventual score, based on the partial evidence supplied by incomplete relevance judgements.",null,null

If a cost file is specified via the flag ""-c <COSTS>"", then document-specific costs are used to calculate expected",Y,TREC-QRELS

Adding BPMCWLMetric(T=4, K=10) to the list of metrics means that the static Bejewelled Player Model will be computed.",null,null
