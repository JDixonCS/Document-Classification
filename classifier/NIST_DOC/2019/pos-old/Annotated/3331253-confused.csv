29,"A careful examination of past work in this area reveals that most current approaches rely on predicting the performance across a set of queries, where each query represents a unique information need; often on a single corpus using a single retrieval method. This is largely an artifact of the test collections commonly used to evaluate new techniques. For example, the TREC [52] initiative has historically defined an information need as a topic using a title, description, and narrative. The title is commonly viewed as a keyword query that a user might issue to a search engine, and the description and narrative more clearly define the user's real information need. While QPP methods have been shown to be effective in this setting, many",Y,TREC

42,"Summary of Contributions. In this work, we show that the effectiveness of a query in representing the underlying information need has a significant impact on QPP quality. We then define a probabilistic QPP framework which encapsulates the fundamental relationship between queries and an information need, and show how it can be easily instantiated using a variety of QPP approaches to improve prediction quality. An extensive empirical evaluation shows that combining information from multiple reference queries dramatically improves prediction quality for queries regardless of their effectiveness in representing the information need, and independent of the QPP method used to instantiate our approach.",null,null

44,"The prediction framework presented by Carmel et al. [11] for estimating topic/information need difficulty accounts for the fact that the information need can be represented by different queries. However, in contrast to our work, the model instantiated from the framework predicts performance for a single query without using information from alternative queries that represent the same information need, and without accounting for how well the query represents the information need.",null,null
,,,
45,"Previous work exists on predicting performance for a single query by estimating the presumed extent to which it represents the underlying information need [44]. This predictor was also used by Roitman et al. [36], where the estimate is based on properties of a pseudo-feedback-based relevance model induced from the retrieved list [27]. There has also been work on ranking query reformulations [19, 37, 54] by estimating the extent to which each reformulation represents the information need. The task we pursue is different from these previous lines of work: we predict performance for a query using information from other queries representing the same information need. The estimator from Sondak et al. [44] is used as a baseline reference comparison in this work.",null,null
,,,
46,Other relevant recent work on using reference document lists for QPP was proposed by Shtok et al. [43]. The reference lists are retrieved by using different retrieval methods for a set of queries. Performance is then predicted based on the similarity between the retrieved list for a query and its corresponding reference lists. Our prediction model uses reference queries and assumes that the,null,null

Some of the estimates derived in this work result in predictors that utilize reference document lists retrieved for different queries; hence, these specific predictors are similar in spirit to those proposed by Shtok et al. [43]. However, we utilize estimates",null,null

49,"Query Variations. There is a long history of research that explores the relationship between a single query and the information needs it represents. Early work exploring the impact of query representation and effectiveness was presented by Belkin et al. [6]. Shortly thereafter, Belkin et al. [7] operationalized these insights to significantly improve retrieval effectiveness by fusing the results from multiple query variations for a single information need.",null,null
,,,
50,"A more recent seminal study of query reformulation in user search sessions in a production search engine also explored the importance of subtle query variations on the overall effectiveness of search results returned to the user [24]. Subsequent studies have shown that query variations can be used in learning-to-rank models to significantly boost query performance [19, 40]. Sheldon et al. [40] and other recent studies [55] have shown that highly-effective query variations, rewrites, and suggestions can be generated offline using random walks over a bipartite graph constructed over click data extracted from large search engine query logs [13]. In the absence of access to commercial search engine logs, effective manual query variations can also be generated using crowdsourcing [3, 4, 8]. We use the UQV query collections [3, 8] as the query variations are publicly available, and hence the results are reproducible.",null,null

51,"Using human query variations, Thomas et al. [48] showed empirically that existing pre-retrieval predictors essentially predict information-need difficulty rather than query difficulty.

While for some queries the AP is nearly 0, most topics have at least one variant with an AP higher than 0.3. In addition, we see that using the TREC title queries for retrieval does not necessarily yield median retrieval effectiveness per topic. For some topics, the performance can be much better or much worse than the median. In other words, the relative effectiveness of the title queries in representing the underlying information need",Y,TREC
