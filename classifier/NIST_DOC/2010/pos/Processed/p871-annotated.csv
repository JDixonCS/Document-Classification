6,"Freshness has been increasingly realized by commercial search engines as an important criteria for measuring the quality of search results. However, most information retrieval methods focus on the relevance of page content to given queries without considering the recency issue. In this work, we mine page freshness from web user maintenance activities and incorporate this feature into web search. We first quantify how fresh the web is over time from two distinct perspectives--the page itself and its in-linked pages--and then exploit a temporal correlation between two types of freshness measures to quantify the confidence of page freshness. Results demonstrate page freshness can be better quantified when combining with temporal freshness correlation. Experiments on a realworld archival web corpus show that incorporating the combined page freshness into the searching process can improve ranking performance significantly on both relevance and freshness.",null,null

11,"Web search engines exploit a variety of evidence in ranking web pages to satisfy users' information needs as expressed by the submitted queries. These information needs may contain distinct implicit demands, such as relevance and diversity. Recency is another such need, and so is utilized as an important criteria in the measurement of search quality. However, most information retrieval methods only match queries based on lexical similarity. Link-based ranking algorithms such as PageRank [1] typically favor old pages since the authority scores are estimated based on a static web structure and old pages have more time to attract in-links.",null,null
,,,
12,"To overcome this problem, we quantify page freshness from web activities over time. We observe that pages and links may have diverse update activity distributions from inception to deletion time points. We infer that pages having similar activity distributions with their in-links suggest that such page activities have stronger influence on their parents' activities.",null,null
,,,
13,"Motivated by the above analysis, in this work we incorporate a temporal freshness correlation (TFC) component in quantifying page freshness, and show that by using TFC, we can achieve a good estimate of how up-to-date the page tends to be, which is helpful to improve search quality in terms of both result freshness and rel-",null,null

31,"simplify analysis, we break the time axis into discrete time points (t0, t1, . . . , ti, . . .) with a unit time interval t ,"" ti - ti-1, where i > 0. It is reasonable to assume that any activities that occur in [ti-1, ti] can be considered as occurring at ti, especially when t is small. We assume that the influence of activity decays exponentially over time. Therefore, we estimate PF and InF at ti by aggregating the web activities with such a decay, written as:""",null,null

77,"Our goal is to improve web search quality on both relevance and freshness. To test the effect of combined page freshness on web search, we use an archival corpus of the .ie domain provided by the Internet Archive [5], covering from Jan. 2000 to Dec. 2007, and extract page and link activities. To minimize the influence of transient pages, we remove pages with fewer than 5 archival snapshots. The remaining sub-collection (with 3.8M unique URLs and 908M temporal links) is used for ranking evaluation.",null,null
,,,
78,"We choose April 2007 as our time point of interest. 90 queries are selected from popular queries in Google Trends2 for evaluation. For each query, we have an average of 84.6 URLs labeled by at least one worker of Amazon Mechanical Turk3. Editors give judgments on each document with respect to a given query for both relevance and freshness. Relevance is judged from ""highly relevant"" (4) to ""not related"" (0). Freshness is judged from ""very fresh"" (4) to ""very stale"" (0). The document with an average score above 2.5 is marked as relevant/fresh.",null,null
,,,
79,"To evaluate the effectiveness of the combined page freshness, we compare with PageRank, running on a single web snapshot of April 2007. The global ranking lists generated by the combined page freshness and PageRank scores are linearly combined with Okapi BM2500 [6] (baseline) by ranks individually. The parameters are the same as Cai et al. [2]. Precision@k and NDCG@k are used as metrics for ranking evaluation on both relevance and freshness. All methods are compared based on their best rank combination of query-specific scores and global scores on metric Precision@10 of relevance. The decay parameter  is set to 1 in this work.",null,null
,,,
80,"Table 2 lists the ranking performance comparison varying the time span involved in the combined page freshness computation. For relevance, except for NDCG@3, the correlation between ranking performance and the time span is not consistent. Unlike relevance, freshness performance consistently improves with the increase of time span used in the combined page freshness computation. This suggests temporal freshness correlation calculated from",null,null
