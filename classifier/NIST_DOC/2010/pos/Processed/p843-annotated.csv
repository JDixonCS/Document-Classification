7,ABSTRACT,null,null
,,,
8,"We evaluate a framework for BM25F-based XML element retrieval. The framework gathers contextual information associated with each XML element into an associated field, which we call a characteristic field. The contents of the element and the contents of the characteristic field are then treated as distinct fields for BM25F weighting purposes. Evidence supporting this framework is drawn from both our own experiments and experiments reported in related work.",null,null

15,1. INTRODUCTION,null,null
,,,
16,"INEX [1], the annual Initiative for the Evaluation of XML retrieval, includes experiments on ad hoc focused XML element retrieval, where the task is to return a ranked list of document elements (e.g., paragraphs, sections, abstracts) in response to a previously unseen query. Elements are required to be non-overlapping, so that no returned element contains another, but otherwise any document element may be returned.",null,null
,,,
17,"While various participating groups have reported attempts to exploit XML structure in order to improve performance on this task, none of these efforts have consistently outperformed the simple approach of applying Okapi BM25 [12] to score individual XML elements and then filtering the resulting ranked list to remove overlap. Under this approach, each element is scored as if it were an independent document. The context of the element -- such as information appearing in the elements that surround it -- is ignored. Runs using this basic approach ranked third in 2004, third in 2007, and first in 2008 [4, 5, 9].",null,null

This contextual information will vary from domain to domain, but might include the title of the overall document, titles from containing elements, and document metadata.",null,null

69,3. THE CHARACTERISTIC FIELD,null,null
,,,
70,"In order to simplify the application of BM25F to XML element retrieval, we propose a framework with only two fields for each element. The body field contains the element body, and the characteristic field contains any contextual or background information that characterizes the element. The precise contents of the characteristic field may vary from element to element. While this approach is similar to that of Robertson et al. [11] and Lu et al. [8] it avoids the complexity of multiple field types and allows a consistent approach to be applied across heterogenous elements.",null,null

72,"Ad Hoc Retrieval. We first report the results of runs on INEX 2009 ad hoc task. We trained on a 5.9GB INEX 2008 Wikipedia corpus [3] with 659,387 articles and 70 assessed topics and tested on a 50.7GB INEX 2009 Wikipedia corpus [14] with 2,666,190 articles and 68 assessed topics. Our training optimized the official metric of iP[0.01]. For these runs, we used a characteristic field formed from the titles of the article and the sections in which an element occurs.",Y,null
,,,
73,Table 1 shows the official INEX results. The BM25F run that ranked first gives a 6.62% improvement over the BM25 run that ranked 12th.,Y,null
,,,
74,"Book Page Retrieval . We used INEX 2008 Book Track data [6] of 50239 books of size 37GB after pre-processing. Only 25 out of 70 topics had relevance judgements, thus we used 17 of them for training, and 8 for testing. The corpus comes with a file, machine readable cataloging (MARC) format [10], that contains information such as book category and library of congress classification (LCC) code.",Y,null
,,,
75,The Book track task required to group the pages by the books and rank the books. Thus all of our runs did so and ranked the books by the highest scoring page returned for the book. Training maximized mean average precision.,null,null
,,,
76,Table 2 shows the results of our experiments. The runs with the plus signs indicate information used in the characteristic field. We see that using characteristic information gives up to 48.92% and 35.45% improvement over BM25 during training and testing respectively.,null,null

92,5. CONCLUSIONS,null,null
,,,
93,"We propose a framework for applying BM25F to XML element retrieval through the addition of a single characteristic field. This characteristic field merges contextual information from multiple sources, which may include inherited titles and metadata. The proposal is inspired by previous work, but aims to avoid the complexity of multiple fields and heterogenous structure by merging contextual information into this single field.",null,null
,,,
94,"The proposal is evaluated in the context of the INEX effort. While our results are preliminary, and the results of the INEX 2009 book track have not yet been fully judged, they suggest that the benefits of field weights may be obtainable even in this simplified framework.",null,null
,,,
95,Future work includes experimenting our version of BM25F on INEX heterogeneous track collection and taking advantage of more detailed structural information available in the new INEX 2009 Wikipedia collection.,null,null
