6,"Pseudo-relevance feedback is an effective technique for improving retrieval results. Traditional feedback algorithms use a whole feedback document as a unit to extract words for query expansion, which is not optimal as a document may cover several different topics and thus contain much irrelevant information. In this paper, we study how to effectively select from feedback documents those words that are focused on the query topic based on positions of terms in feedback documents. We propose a positional relevance model (PRM) to address this problem in a unified probabilistic way. The proposed PRM is an extension of the relevance model to exploit term positions and proximity so as to assign more weights to words closer to query words based on the intuition that words closer to query words are more likely to be related to the query topic. We develop two methods to estimate PRM based on different sampling processes. Experiment results on two large retrieval datasets show that the proposed PRM is effective and robust for pseudo-relevance feedback, significantly outperforming the relevance model in both document-based feedback and passage-based feedback.",null,null

20,"feedback is to assume that a small number of top-ranked documents in the initial retrieval results are relevant and select from these documents related terms to the query to improve the query representation through query expansion, which generally leads to improvement of retrieval performance.",null,null
,,,
21,"Most existing feedback algorithms (e.g., [26, 24, 27, 3, 25, 16, 32]) use a whole feedback document as a unit for selecting expansion terms, which, however, is non-optimal when the content of a document is incoherent (i.e., covering several different topics) and thus may contain much irrelevant information as often happens in Web search. The existence of multiple topics and irrelevant information would lead to a noisy feedback model as potentially harmful terms from non-relevant topics may be picked up to include in the feedback model. As a result, the use of pseudo feedback may not improve or even decrease the retrieval performance. Thus a critical challenge in improving all feedback methods is to effectively select from feedback documents those terms that are most likely relevant to the query topic.",null,null
,,,
22,"In this paper, we solve this challenge by exploiting the position and proximity information of terms as cues to assess if a term is related to the query topic. Since topically related content is usually grouped together in text documents, terms closer to the occurrences of query words are, in general, more likely relevant to the query topic, thus a good feedback model should intuitively place higher weights on such terms.",null,null
,,,
23,"Based on this intuition, we propose a novel positional relevance model (PRM) to incorporate the cues of term positions and term proximity in a probabilistic feedback model based on statistical language modeling. The key idea is to extend the relevance model [16] to aggregate the associations between a term and query words at the position level via the positional language model (PLM) [19]. An important advantage of estimating a relevance model based on PLM is that it can model the ""relevant positions"" in a feedback document with probabilistic models so as to assign more weights to terms at more relevant positions in a principled way, thus leading naturally to selection of expansion terms more likely relevant to the query topic.",null,null
,,,
24,"Since PRM estimates a relevance model at the level of term positions, it incorporates individual term positions directly into a probabilistic model. This is in contrast with virtually all the existing pseudo feedback techniques which have only made use of term statistics at the document level [26, 24, 27, 3, 25, 16, 32, 18], or at the best, at the level of passages [2, 30, 17, 21] without distinguishing every different position.",null,null
,,,
25,579,null,null
,,,
26,"Analogously to the two methods proposed for estimating the relevance model [16], we also derive two methods for estimating PRM, leading to two different ways to aggregate term information based on positions. We evaluate the proposed PRM on two large TREC datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PRM is effective in exploiting term proximity for pseudo feedback and significantly outperforms the relevance model in both document-based feedback and passage-based feedback.",null,null

28,2.1 Pseudo-Relevance Feedback,null,null
,,,
29,"Pseudo-relevance feedback has been shown to be effective with various retrieval models [26, 24, 27, 3, 25, 16, 32, 18].",null,null
,,,
30,"In the vector space model, feedback is usually done by using the Rocchio algorithm, which forms a new query vector by maximizing its similarity to pseudo-relevant documents [26]. The feedback method in classical probabilistic models is to select expansion terms primarily based on Robertson/Sparck-Jones weight [24].",null,null
,,,
31,"Several query expansion techniques have been developed in the language modeling framework, including, e.g., the mixture-model feedback method [32] and the relevance model [16]. The basic idea is to use feedback documents to estimate a better query language model. Both the mixture model and relevance model have been shown to be very effective, but the relevance model appears to be more robust [18].",null,null
,,,
32,"In the mixture-model feedback [32], the words in feedback documents are assumed to be drawn from two models: (1) background model and (2) topic model. The mixturemodel feedback finds the topic model that best describes the feedback documents by separating the topic model from the background model. The topic model is then interpolated with the original query model to form the expanded query.",null,null
,,,
33,"Much like mixture-model feedback, the relevance model also estimates an improved query language model. Given a query Q, a relevance model is a multinomial distribution P (w|Q) that encodes the likelihood of each term w given the query as evidence. To estimate the relevance model, the authors first compute the joint probability of observing a word together with the query words in each feedback document and then aggregate the evidence by summing over all the documents. It essentially uses the query likelihood P (Q|D) as the weight for document D and takes an average of the probability of word w given by each document language model.",null,null
,,,
34,"All these pseudo feedback algorithms use a whole feedback document as a unit, and thus term position and proximity evidences are largely ignored. Our work is an extension of the relevance model to estimate a feedback model based on individual term positions.",null,null
,,,
35,2.2 Passage Feedback,null,null
,,,
36,"There have been several studies to exploit passage-level evidence of documents for feedback, e.g., [2, 30, 17], which can potentially address the heterogeneous topical structure of documents to some degree. However, these approaches usually take a traditional feedback model as a black box to handle sub-document units as if they were regular documents. For example, Liu and Croft's work [17] estimates a relevance model based on the best matching passage of each feedback document, where fixed-length arbitrary passages",null,null
,,,
37,"that resemble overlapped windows but with an arbitrary starting point [12] can often be used due to its effectiveness and efficiency [12, 17]. A limitation of this approach is that term positions are not directly incorporated into the feedback model. As we will show later in the paper, the proposed PRM outperforms such a passage feedback approach.",null,null
,,,
38,"Some other approaches, e.g., [31, 4], make use of visual cues or eye tracker to improve passage feedback for web search: on the server side of a search engine, documents can be decomposed into topically different components via visual cues [31], while on the client side of users, gaze-based attention feedback [4] can go down to the sub-document level by exploiting evidence about which document parts the user looks at. However, such approaches face the same problems as general passage feedback without being able to model each individual position.",null,null
,,,
39,"In fact, these passage-based or sub-document level feedback models are orthogonal to the proposed PRM in the sense that PRM can be applied to passages to model proximity inside a passages in the same way as it can be applied to whole documents. Moreover, the underlying positional language model [19], which can capture passage-level evidence in a soft way in model estimation, has been shown to work better than imposing a ""hard"" boundary of passages.",null,null
,,,
40,"Recently, Metzler and Croft's work on Latent Concept Expansion [21] also indirectly captures term position and proximity evidence through the use of appropriate passages. Their work provides a more general model which is complementary with our ideas in that we can use PRM as an effective feature defined on their graph, so our PRM scores can then be combined with other features explored in [21] to further improve its performance.",null,null

41,2.3 Term Proximity Heuristic in IR,null,null
,,,
42,"The term proximity heuristic, which rewards a document where the matched query terms occur close to each other, has been previously studied in [13, 14, 11, 9, 23, 20, 5, 6, 28, 19, 10, 34]. Keen's work [13, 14] is among the earliest efforts, in which, a ""NEAR"" operator was introduced to address proximity in Boolean retrieval model. The shortest interval containing a match set was first used as a measure of proximity in [9, 11]. Recent work has attempted to heuristically incorporate proximity into an existing retrieval model (often through score combinations) [22, 23, 5, 6, 28]. For example, a variety of proximity measures were proposed and explored in [28]. Another work [10] used a learning approach to combine various proximity measures to obtain an effective proximity-based retrieval function. Recently in our previous work [19], we proposed a positional language model (PLM) for information retrieval, which not only captured term proximity information but also covered passage retrieval in a unified language modeling approach. However, in all these studies, term proximity has been solely used for ranking documents in response to a given query rather than improving pseudo feedback.",null,null
,,,
43,"There has been relatively little work done in the area of formally modeling term proximity heuristic in the context of pseudo feedback. However, there have been several attempts to simply combine term proximity with other feedback heuristics to select good expansion terms. In [29], several distance functions were evaluated for selecting query expansion terms from windows or passages surrounding query term occurrences; however, no improvement was observed as",null,null

This method was labeled as ""NoFB"". (2) The baseline pseudo feedback method is the relevance model ""RM3"" described in Section 3.1 [1], which is one of the most effective and robust pseudo feedback methods under language modeling framework [18]. (3) Another baseline pseudo feedback method is a standard passage-based feedback model, labeled as ""RM3-p"", which estimates the RM3 relevance model based on the best matching passage of each feedback document [17]. (4) We have two variations of PRM, i.e., ""PRM1"" and ""PRM2"", which are based on the two estimation methods described in Section 3.2, respectively. (5) In addition, we also used PRM1 and PRM2 for passage feedback in a way as RM3-p does. Specifically, we first computed a PLM for each position of the document, and then we estimate a PRM based on a passage of size 2 centered at the position with the maximum positional query likelihood score (see Equation 17).

From the table, it is clear that PRM1, PRM2, PRM1-p and PRM2-p all outperform RM3-p significantly in most cases, suggesting that our model does not only have sound statistical foundation but also works effectively. In addition, we also observe that RM3-p behaves quite differently in two datasets: it beats RM3 on ClueWeb09 but loses to RM3 on Terabyte06. However, all the four variations of PRM perform better than RM3 consistently. Finally, it is also interesting to see that PRM1 and PRM2 work similarly to PRM1-p and PRM2-p respectively, which may mean that PRM1 and PRM2 have already achieved successfully an effect of passage-based feedback by assigning weights to different positions, so it does not bring too much additional benefit to apply PRM to passages explicitly.",null,null

,,,
368,"Experiment results on two large web data sets show that the proposed PRM is quite effective and robust and performs significantly better than the state of the art relevance model in both document-based feedback and passage-based feedback. Compared to the relevance model, the proposed models are also less sensitive to the setting of various parameters, such as feedback coefficient, number of feedback documents, and number of expansion terms. Comparing the two estimation methods of PRM, the first method (PRM1) appears to be more effective, while the second (PRM2) tends to be more robust. Both methods achieve its optimal retrieval performance when setting the  value in a range around 200 and  to around 0.1.",null,null
,,,
369,"There are many interesting future research directions to explore. One of the most interesting directions is to further study whether setting a term-specific and/or query-specific  can further improve performance. Another interesting direction is to study how to optimize  automatically based on the layout of web pages. Improving the estimate of other components in PRM (e.g., the probability of choosing a position in a document) would also be interesting.",null,null
