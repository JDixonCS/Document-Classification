5,"Portable, reusable test collections are a vital part of research and development in information retrieval. Reusability is difficult to assess, however. The standard approach-- simulating judgment collection when groups of systems are held out, then evaluating those held-out systems--only works when there is a large set of relevance judgments to draw on during the simulation. As test collections adapt to larger and larger corpora, it becomes less and less likely that there will be sufficient judgments for such simulation experiments. Thus we propose a methodology for information retrieval experimentation that collects evidence for or against the reusability of a test collection while judgments are being made. Using this methodology along with the appropriate statistical analyses, researchers will be able to estimate the reusability of their test collections while building them and implement ""course corrections"" if the collection does not seem to be achieving desired levels of reusability. We show the robustness of our design to inherent sources of variance, and provide a description of an actual implementation of the framework for creating a large test collection.",null,null

9,1. INTRODUCTION,null,null
,,,
10,Test collections are a vital part of research and development in information retrieval. They enable rapid development of new approaches to retrieval. They allow us to identify subtle distinctions between retrieval methods that could not be identified by users but that can add up to improved user experience over time. They support feature selection and parameter tuning by allowing us to efficiently test many possible combinations and values.,null,null

12,"Unfortunately, test collections are expensive. They require judgments of the relevance of individual documents to topics in a sample. To properly control for variance, a test collection must have many topics and many judgments, and these require a great deal human effort. This expense makes reusability desirable: the cost of a test collection can be justified by the fact that it is amortized over many uses.",null,null
,,,
13,"Constructing reusable test collections is difficult. The relevance judgments must be complete enough that future users of that collection can have confidence that their systems will be accurately evaluated. The majority of reusable test collections in the field exist as a result of the efforts of the organizers and participants of TREC (the Text REtrieval Conference), CLEF (the Cross Language Evaluation Forum), NTCIR (NII Test Collections for IR), and INEX (INitiative for the Evaluation of XML retrieval). These test collections arose by conducting an experiment to evaluate different approaches to a particular retrieval problem, and their reusability is a function of their large size and the diversity of approaches that were included in the experiment.",null,null
,,,
14,"The standard experimental design for IR evaluation is a simple repeated-measures design, in which experimental units are topics/queries, treatments are systems, and each system provides ranked results for each query. This is the design that has been used for virtually every TREC, CLEF, NTCIR, and INEX track that has resulted in the release of a test collection. Measurements on experimental units are evaluation measures such as average precision (AP) calculated over relevance judgments; judging a pool of documents retrieved by the participating systems ensures that the measurements will be as accurate as possible.",null,null
,,,
15,"Reusability emerges as a result of using a large and diverse set of retrieval systems and making sure they are judged to a substantial depth using pooling: there are simply so many judgments that it is unlikely any new system will ever be developed that does not retrieve many of the same documents that were judged as part of the original experiment. But as test collections grow larger and larger, pooling becomes more infeasible. Furthermore, recent work suggests that, for an experiment like that described above, it is actually more cost-effective to use many queries with very few judgments each. Thus TREC has begun adopting alternatives to pooling [15]: statistical sampling, which attempts to pick out the judgments that will result in a low-variance unbiased estimator [2], or algorithmic approaches that try to pick out the judgments that will reduce variance regardless of bias introduced [6]. But while these are more cost-effective for answering the original evaluation question, it is not at all",null,null
,,,

,,,
17,"clear that they are cost-effective in the sense of producing test collections that can be reused many times. Because there are many fewer judgments, it is much more likely that a future system will retrieve many documents that were not judged, and therefore much more likely that we will not be able to accurately measure the performance of that system.",null,null
,,,
18,"Our goal is to elevate reusability to a basic consideration along with evaluation. We do that by proposing an experimental design that collects evidence for or against reusability while judgments are being collected. The method that is used to select judgments does not matter, but the design is tied to the notion that more queries with fewer judgments is the correct way to build a test collection. It relies on having a large number of queries that can be partitioned into a combinatorial number of blocks.",null,null
,,,
19,"In Section 2 we define what it means for a test collection to be reusable and discuss previous work on the topic. In Section 3, the main body of this work, we describe our design and the statistical analyses that it supports, and anticipate and answer some questions about its validity. In Section 5 we demonstrate the use of the design and analysis in the construction of an actual large test collection.",null,null

20,2. TEST COLLECTION REUSABILITY,null,null
,,,
21,"A test collection consists of a corpus of documents, a set of topics that are representative of a particular task, and judgments of relevance of documents to topics. These judgments are generally taken from a set of retrieval systems performing the task. We define reusability as follows: A test collection is reusable if and only if we can use it for precise measurements of the performance of systems that did not contribute to its judgments. By ""precise"" we mean that the measurements fall within some given error intervals with high probability. By ""systems that did not contribute judgments"" we mean systems that are likely to be developed with current technology--it is always possible that new, unforeseen technology could produce retrieval systems that are both good and unlike anything seen before; since we will never be able to predict such cases, we do not want to tie reusability to them too much.",null,null
,,,
22,"Test collections are used for many purposes beyond simple evaluation. Furthermore, evaluation comes in many different flavors. Below we discuss some aspects of reusability and previous work on this topic.",null,null
,,,
23,2.1 Applications of Test Collections,null,null
,,,
24,"In addition to evaluation, test collections are used for training and optimization, including model selection, feature selection, and parameter tuning, for failure analysis, for data exploration, and many other purposes. While our focus is on evaluation, these other uses are important. Some can be seen as being related to evaluation: optimization uses an objective function based on an evaluation measure; the goal of failure analysis is to find reasons for an evaluation measure being different than expected.",null,null
,,,
25,2.2 Evaluating Reusability,null,null
,,,
26,"The question of reusability has been studied primarily in the context of depth pooling. TREC and other fora form pools from the top documents retrieved by each submitted run for each topic; under the assumption that documents not highly ranked could be considered nonrelevant, test collections based on such pools are likely very reusable.",null,null
,,,
27,"Harman [11] tested this by examining a pool formed by the documents in ranks 101-200 over the TREC-2 and TREC3 collections. Her study showed up to 21% more relevant documents could be found. Along the same line, Zobel [17] extrapolated the number of relevant documents found by depth to suggest that there could be up to twice as many relevant documents in the collection as there are in the pool. To examine the effect of the missing relevant documents on new systems that had not contributed any documents to the formation of the pool, he performed a leave-one-runout simulation. For each participating run, he removed all the documents it uniquely retrieved from the judgments and compared the evaluation over this reduced set of judgments to the evaluation with the full set. His study showed that the effect of the missing documents was minimal.",null,null
,,,
28,"Voorhees adapted the leave-one-out methodology to leave out all of the runs contributed by a particular site at a time, under the assumption that runs submitted by the same participating site are similar enough that they retrieve very similar documents [14]. This leave-sites-out simulation has since become the standard approach to evaluating reusability.",null,null
,,,
29,"Buеttcher et al. [3] employed the leave-one-site-out over the TREC 2006 Terabyte collection and confirmed Zobel's conclusion. Further, the reusability of the collection by leaving out all manual runs was also tested. Given that manual runs are usually among the best performing ones, this did lead to somewhat different evaluation results.",null,null
,,,
30,"Sakai [13] employed leave-one-site-out, take-just-one-site, and take-just-three-sites over TREC and NTCIR data. His goal was to identify the effects of missing judgments on a number of different evaluation metrics. He considered all pairs of runs over the full judgment set and found the number with statistically significant differences, then repeated the process with judgments obtained by one of the three aforementioned methods and counted the errors. The results demonstrate that while the rankings of systems over the full and reduced set of judgments are similar, missing relevant documents leads to many errors of commission, i.e. finding differences significant even though they are not.",null,null
,,,
31,"Carterette et al. proposed that reusability should be evaluated in terms of the ability of the test collection to produce high confidence in evaluation results, specifically pairwise comparisons between systems [4] or width of confidence interval on an evaluation measure [7]. The former work used judgments from two systems to evaluate a larger set of 10 systems; the latter employed the leave-sites-out methodology discussed above to predict confidence interval width when evaluating new systems.",null,null
,,,
32,"The simulation approaches above depend on having a fairly large number of judgments in the first place: any document that is selected for judging in the simulation phase must already have an actual judgment made by a human assessor. Without a fairly complete set of judgments it is likely that documents selected for judging will not actually have judgments; it is not possible to apply simulation to evaluate the reusability of TREC Million Query collections, for instance, because holding systems out would result in different documents being selected for judging than were originally judged for the track.",null,null

41,3. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN,null,null
,,,
42,"As discussed above, the standard design used in systembased IR evaluations is the repeated-measures design. This is appropriate for drawing conclusions about differences between systems, but it does not tell us anything about reusability. Furthermore, as discussed in Section 2.2, post-hoc evaluations of reusability are impossible when refinements to the implementation of the repeated-measures design such as statistical sampling or algorithmic selection were used.",null,null
,,,
43,"In our design, each system is held out from actual judgment collection for some queries. After the judging is complete, ""new"" systems are constructed by putting together all the queries from which a system was held out and evaluating it with the judgments contributed by the non-held-out systems for those same queries. Note that this means the reusability experiment can be performed only once.",null,null
,,,
44,"Our design is meant to serve two ends: to draw conclusions about differences between systems, and to draw conclusions about the future reusability of the test collection that will result. It is meant to be ""fair"" in the sense that each system contributes judgments to the same number of queries. Since it can introduce bias or variance depending on which systems are held out from which queries, it attempts to minimize/control that as much as possible by ensuring that no two systems are held out of the same queries consistently. The complete description follows.",null,null

It provides a baseline for answering questions about reusability.",null,null

47,"In each subsequent set, a subset of systems are held out during judgment collection for each topic. The held-out set is different for each topic.

After performing two sets of pairwise tests (one set for all pairs of systems over the baseline topics, one for the same pairs over the reusability topics), we can form a contingency table showing the agreement in significance between the two sets of tests.

The remaining 492 topics had two sites held out during judging. Held-out sites were selected by round-robin scheduling. Assessors did not know whether they were judging a reusability topic or not, and topic order was randomized, so there is no reason to suppose that the reusability topic sample is biased compared to the baseline sample.

,,,
394,"As mentioned in Section 4, differences in mean scores over baseline topics and mean scores over reusability topics for a given site may be due to a number of different effects: (1) the baseline and reuse topics are two different topic sets of different size; (2) apart from the site under study there are two other sites that did not contribute documents to each reusability topic; (3) the site under study itself did not contribute documents to the reuse topics (this is the actual effect we would like to quantify); and finally, (4) for this particular study the fact that both methods evaluate runs with a very small number of documents introduces some variability even in the baseline topics.",null,null

395,"The plots in Figure 2 attempt to separate the second and third effects. Essentially, the comparison of the mean scores between the 145 baseline topics and the 160 site reuse topics (right) summarizes the results of the reusability experiment, and it is what an actual new site would observe by using the MQ 2009 collection. StatMAP scores over the reuse topics are positively correlated with the statMAP scores over the baseline topics, though the correlation is rather weak. MTC EMAP scores over these two sets of topics are well correlated. One can consider the other two plots as the decomposition of the effects seen in the right plot. The left plot illustrates the effect of holding out sites other than the site under study. For the statMAP case this has a rather strong effect on the scores computed, though it is minimal for the MTC scores. The middle plots try to isolate the effect of holding out the site under study.

401,"The plots give a visual sense of reusability, suggesting within-site may be acceptable at the level of rank agreement if not score agreement, but between-site is likely not acceptable. To quantify this, we computed three correlation statistics as described in Section 3.2.2. First we computed the overall Kendall's tau between the ranking induced by the scores in the two topic sets. This is a rough estimate of the between-site reusability. For statMAP scores this is 0.7643, while for MTC EMAP scores this is 0.8350, both of which are rather low. Next we computed the Kendall's  among the runs of each individual site to estimate withinsite reusability; Table 6 shows these. Note that the values are not comparable across sites since the number of runs compared affects the Kendall's  values. Finally, we computed a  -like correlation to quantify the ability to compare ""new"" runs to contributing participants. For each site, we count the number of its reusability runs that are correctly ordered against the baseline runs and the number that have been swapped with a baseline run. Every comparison involves exactly one run for that site; for this measure we do not compare two runs from the same site or two runs from a different site. The final value is determined identically to Kendall's  ; the set of values can be seen in Table 6.",null,null
,,,
402,"The significance test agreement procedure, when applied to this data, suggests that there is not enough evidence to reject within-site reusability (p > 0.5), but there is more than enough to reject between-site reusability (p < 0.01). To explain how within-site reusability holds despite some of the low  correlations in Table 6, we note that  is not able to capture anything about whether swaps are ""reasonable"". The lowest  is -0.6 for UIUC, but by inspection (Fig. 2) UIUC's systems are all very close to each other. It is perfectly reasonable that they would be ordered differently over another set of topics, and thus the low  is not a concern. For between-site reusability, however, we have seen that it is unlikely; that the 2 test confirms this is a point in its favor. The full contingency table for between-site reusability is shown in Table 5.",null,null
