9,ABSTRACT,null,null
10,"Logistic average misclassification percentage (lam%) is a key measure for the spam filtering performance. This paper demonstrates that a spam filter can achieve a perfect 0.00% in lam%, the minimal value in theory, by simply setting a biased threshold during the classifier modeling. At the same time, the overall classification performance reaches only a low accuracy. The result suggests that the role of lam% for spam filtering evaluation should be re-examined.",null,null

17,1. INTRODUCTION,null,null
18,"The spam filtering is generally regarded as a binary classification task to identify spams from normal e-mails (i.e. hams). To evaluate the performance of spam filters, the overall classification accuracy (or the total proportion of misclassified messages) is not a good choice because all errors are treated on equal footing. Nevertheless, the logistic average misclassification percentage (lam%), a single quality measure based only on the filter's binary ham/spam classification accuracy, is proposed as: lam% ,"" logit-1 ((logit(hm%)+logit(sm%))/2), where logit(x)"",""log(x/(1-x)), in which hm% is ham misclassification percentage, and sm% is spam misclassification percentage[1]. As the geometric mean of the odds of ham and spam misclassification[1], lam% is widely adopted together with 1-AUC by open spam filtering competitions including TREC Spam Filtering Track and CEAS(Conference on Email and Anti-Spam) Spam-filter Challenge. The lam% is designed to impose no a priori relative importance on either ham or spam misclassification, rewarding equally an improvement in the odds of either. However, this paper demonstrates that lam% is inherently defected in allowing a 0.00% by a biased threshold, whereas maintaining a very high error rate. Therefore, it is not reliable enough to observe only lam% as the measure for spam filtering evaluation.""",null,null

22,"lam% , logit-1 logit(hm%) + logit(sm%) 2",null,null
23,", logit-1((log hm% + log sm% ) / 2) 1 - hm% 1 - sm%",null,null

32,"(1 - hm%)(1 - sm%) Therefore a threshold of a spam filter could be set toward either side of hm% or sm%, and this will minimize (log hm%sm% ) / 2 . However an over biased threshold",null,null
33,"(1 - hm%)(1 - sm%) such as 1 in probability model will lead to hm%,""0, resulting to compute log(0) or to be divided by 0 when computing lam%. Therefore, the threshold should be well determined in order to make a desired hm% and sm%.""",null,null
34,"Each message with its score above the threshold is labeled as spam, otherwise ham. Through setting a biased threshold, i.e. setting the threshold very high or very low, hm% or sm% could approach zero, and so lam% will tend eventually to be zero. In this sense, the way to optimize lam% via a biased threshold trick is independent of specific filtering models. And Section 3 presents the details of optimizing lam% under the framework of Logistic Regression.",null,null

68,"Usually, the prediction is spam if p > 0.5, or ham otherwise (see Line 4 and 5). As mentioned in Section 2, lam% can be optimized by setting the biased threshold. The threshold can be set nearly to 1 or 0, which can decrease hm% or sm% to 0. LR with the biased threshold is referred as biased LR. For biased LR, pseudo codes are the same to the traditional LR except that Line 4 is replaced by ""if ( p > threshold ) predict spam"". Note that the weight updating in biased LR is not changed, and thus the final prediction scores of messages are not biased (i.e. not changed).",null,null
69,TONE (Train On or Near Error) is adopted to train the spam filter in the actually modeling process. Two types of samples are trained: (1) misclassified samples by the filter; and (2) correctly classified samples if falling within a predefined classification boundary.,null,null

72,We evaluated the lam% optimization method on TREC public spam filtering datasets. The basic information of the datasets is shown in Table 1.,null,null
73,"Table 2 shows the experimental results which are acquired by TREC Spam Filter Evaluation Toolkit. hm%, sm% and 1-AUC",null,null
74,are also reported. The parameters of LR and the biased LR are the,null,null
75,"same except the threshold: TRAIN_RATE ,"" 0.002, TONE "","" 0.45, and threshold "", 0.999999 for biased LR.",null,null
76,"By analyzing the experimental results, we can see that the proposed method decreases lam% to 0.00%, i.e. the minimal value in theory, across all datasets. Although lam% is perfect, the accuracy of the filters for most cases is below 50%, i.e. the performance of random guess. Therefore, there is an obvious defect in lam% as the measure for spam filtering evaluation.",null,null
77,"It is very interesting that 1-AUC (area under the ROC curve), the other measure of spam filtering, is left untouched when biasing the threshold. This means that optimizing lam% method proposed",null,null
78,"in this paper does not hurt 1-AUC. 1-AUC can be computed as 1AUC ,"" SwappedPairs/m/n [4][5], where m and n are the number of golden spam messages and that of golden ham messages, respectively. Swapped pairs are defined as pairs that are ranked in the wrong order. Hence, ROC area also has a probabilistic interpretation: the probability that a random ham will receive a lower score than a random spam[1]. Because of this pair-wise correct measure [4] and unchanged prediction score of the biased LR, 1-AUC is unchanged too.""",null,null
