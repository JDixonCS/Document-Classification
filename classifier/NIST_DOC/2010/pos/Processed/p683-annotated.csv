14,"Generative models such as statistical language modeling have been widely studied in the task of expert search to model the relationship between experts and their expertise indicated in supporting documents. On the other hand, discriminative models have received little attention in expert search research, although they have been shown to outperform generative models in many other information retrieval and machine learning applications. In this paper, we propose a principled relevance-based discriminative learning framework for expert search and derive specific discriminative models from the framework. Compared with the state-ofthe-art language models for expert search, the proposed research can naturally integrate various document evidence and document-candidate associations into a single model without extra modeling assumptions or effort. An extensive set of experiments have been conducted on two TREC Enterprise track corpora (i.e., W3C and CERC) to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.",Y,null

25,"As an important IR application, expert search (also known as expert finding) has received substantial attention in the IR research community. Rapid progress has been made in modeling and evaluation since the launch of TREC Enterprise Track in 2005 [12]. A notable observation is that probabilistic generative models have dominated the literature of expert search. In particular, many statistical language modeling techniques were proposed to model the relationship between a candidate expert and a query. These models usually characterize a generative process of how a query is generated from supporting documents of an expert. The key ingredient in these methods is to determine associations between people and documents because the associations are ambiguous in the TREC scenarios as well as in many realistic settings. Previous works have investigated different metrics or a combination of them to measure the associations, but the way of choosing or combining them is rather often heuristic and lacks of a clear justification. Furthermore, document evidence such as document or expert authority information, internal and external document structures, global evidence and so on is shown to be able to significantly improve expert retrieval performance, but to incorporate these features often requires many modeling assumptions and is often unwieldy.",Y,null
,,,
26,"On the other hand, discriminative models, another important class of probabilistic models with solid statistical foundation, are nearly absent in the research of expert search, especially on the TREC evaluations. In fact, discriminative models have been preferred over generative models in the recent past in many machine learning applications, partly because of their attractive theoretical properties. In the domain of IR, various discriminative models have also been applied to many retrieval problems (e.g., [23]). However, very limited research has been conducted to design discriminative models for expert search.",null,null

27,"In this work, we present a relevance-based discriminative learning framework for expert search and derive specific discriminative models from the framework. Similar to some prominent language models, the proposed models aggregate document evidence and document-candidate associations through supporting documents. Unlike the language models, we directly model the conditional probability of relevance given a query and an expert. As a result, heterogeneous or even arbitrary features can be naturally included into a single model. The parameters associated with the features are automatically learned from training data.

31,2. RELATED WORK,null,null
,,,
32,"The early work on expert finding systems was initiated in the Knowledge Management community, usually in the form of yellow pages [9]. These systems relied on experts to judge and input their skills by themselves against a predefined set of keywords, and thus the task was time-consuming. More recent techniques locate experts in an automatic fashion. An overview of early automatic expert finding systems is provided in [36]. The task of expert search has received a significant amount of attention as the task had been included in the TREC Enterprise track from 2005 to 2008 [12, 32, 1, 7]. The TREC Enterprise tracks provided a common platform for researchers to empirically evaluate methods for expert search. They demonstrated the feasibility of expert search on heterogeneous data collections. In the TREC corpora, the relationship between documents and experts is ambiguous and thus to model the document-candidate associations is a key issue in expert search research.",Y,null
,,,
33,"Most of the recent work on expert search generally falls into two categories: profile-centric and document-centric approaches. Balog et al. [3] formalizes the two methods by proposing two generative language models. Their Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, which is equivalent to a profile-centric approach, and their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts, which is a documentcentric approach. It has been shown in [3] that Model 2 is generally more effective than Model 1 and since then it becomes one of the most prominent language models for expert search. In [8], a two-stage language model combining a document relevance and co-occurrence model is proposed, which is essentially equivalent to Model 2. An attempt to further improve their models is made by proposing a proximitybased document representation for incorporating sequential information in text [25]. There are many other generative probabilistic models proposed for expert finding. For example, Serdyukov and Hiemstra [30] propose an expert-centric language model. Fang and Zhai [14] derive two families of generative models by applying probability ranking principle. Probabilistic topic models are also proposed to simultaneously model the topical distribution of expertise evidence and experts [34].",null,null
,,,
34,Some alternative approaches to expert search exist beyond language modeling. One effective approach is to treat the problem of ranking experts as a voting problem based on data fusion techniques [21]. Eleven different voting strategies were proposed to aggregate over the documents associated to an expert. Another approach is to model the process of expert finding by probabilistic random walks on so-called expertise graphs [31]. Many other expert finding methods were proposed during TREC Enterprise tracks.,Y,
,,,
35,"Besides the models, some researchers have shown that suitable features can help significantly boost the performance of expert finding. These features include document authority information such as the PageRank, indegree, and URL length [38], graph-based expert authority [10], internal document structures that indicate the experts' associations with the content of documents [6], non-local evidence [2], and the evidence that can be acquired outside of an enterprise [29]. Additional evidence can be integrated by identifying home pages of candidate experts and clustering relevant documents [20]. Proximity features that characterize the cooccurrence of query and expert mentions in the document are also shown indicative by the top runs in the TREC evaluations [16]. This led to several window-based approaches including [25, 4, 20].",Y,
,,,
36,"On the other hand, the early work of applying discriminative models in IR can date back to the early 1980s in which the maximum entropy approach was investigated to get around term independence assumptions in probabilistic generative models [11]. More recently, Nallapati [23] compared the performance of the maximum entropy model and support vector machines with that of language modeling in ad hoc retrieval and homepage finding, and argued that SVMs are preferred over language models because of their ability to learn arbitrary features automatically. Furthermore, it has been shown that feature-based discriminative models can consistently and significantly outperform current state of the art retrieval models with the correct choice of features [22]. Discriminative models have received increasing attention in IR, as another related area, learning to rank for IR, sparked genuine interest among researchers in the community [18]. Most of the learning to rank models are discriminative in nature and they have been shown improvements over their generative counterparts in ad hoc retrieval. Benchmark data sets such as LETOR [19] are also available for research on learning to rank. Although valuable work has been done on discriminative models for ad hoc retrieval and other IR domains, very limited research has been conducted to design discriminative models for expert search. The only relevant work that we are aware of is [15], which addressed the issue of differentiating heterogeneous sources according to specific queries and experts by learning associated weights from data, but the work did not model document-candidate relationship nor address how to incorporate new document evidence, which are two key issues in expert search.",null,null

Here, relevant documents are retrieved for the expertise requested, and they are used as evidence to indicate whether the associated candidates are experts. After aggregating all such evidence, the experts can be identified. As  () is relatively easy to determine in language models, the key ingredient in this model (and also in many other language models for expert search) is to estimate the document-candidate associations:  (), or  () if  () is assumed to be uniform.  () can be estimated by various methods. The simplest form is the boolean model where associations are binary decisions:  () ,"" 1 if the candidate appears in the document; otherwise,  () "", 0. More sophisticated methods are frequency based which consider the number of times that a candidate appears in the document. A set of heuristic combinations of all these metrics are also compared and investigated in [6].",null,null

54,"For the text-based retrieval, conventional relevance-based probabilistic models rank documents by sorting the conditional probability that each document would be judged relevant to the given query [17]. The underlying principle using probabilistic models for information retrieval is called probability ranking principle [26]. The Binary Independence Model (BIM) [27] is a realization of this principle. In the domain of expert search, the similar principle can be used where experts are ranked according to the descending order of the conditional probability of relevance given an expert and a query. Fang and Zhai [14] applied this principle in studying expert search problem. Both BIM and [14]'s models are generative and they use Bayes' theorem to reverse the original conditional probability.",null,null

In our framework, (, ) can take any function form with parameter  that needs to estimate from training data. Based on different forms of , the resulting discriminative models are different.

186,4.4 Advantages of Discriminative Models for Expert Search,null,null
,,,
187,"Some theoretical results show that discriminative models tend to have a lower asymptotic error [24]. Besides the theoretical considerations, we believe there are specific reasons for the domain of expert search that make discriminative models a suitable choice. First of all, the proposed discriminative models can effortlessly incorporate features. As shown in Section 2 and prior research, expert search can benefit from including various types of features. Language modeling approaches often require many modeling assumptions and extra modeling effort to include new features especially when the heterogeneous features are present. Secondly, discriminative models typically make fewer model assumptions than their generative counterparts. For example, many state-of-the-art generative models, including Model 2, the candidate-generation model [14] and the twostage language model approach [8], assume that the query  and candidate  are independent given the document , i.e., (, ) ,"" (). It requires extra modeling effort for these models to overcome the assumption [4]. In contrast, our proposed discriminative models can easily get around it. For example,  (2 "","" 1, ) in Eqn. 6 can be replaced by  (2 "","" 1, , ) where no independence assumption is made on  (2 "","" 1, , ). Thirdly, the discriminative models directly and naturally characterize the notion of relevance. In Model 2 and many other language models, there""",null,null

For TREC 2005 and 2006, the document collection was a crawl of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [12, 32]. For TREC 2007 and 2008, a different and more realistic corpus was introduced, which is a crawl of the website of Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO). The corpus is known as the CSIRO Enterprise Research Collection (CERC) [1, 7]. Table 1 gives detailed statistics of the collections and query sets. The W3C data is supplemented with a list of 1092 candidate experts represented by their full names and email addresses while the CERC data do not contain a predefined list of candidates. Based on the observation that most CSIRO employees have a CSIRO email address following the pattern ""firstname.lastname@csiro.au"", we extract a list of candidates with email addresses matching this pattern from text. We also use heuristic rules to filter non-personal addresses (e.g. education.act@csiro.au). The total number of candidates extracted is 3,482. In 2005, 50 queries were created based on the working groups in W3C (there were 10 training topics also available in 2005). In 2006, 49 queries were developed by the track participants collectively using the provided list of supporting documents for each candidate.

Although different years have different ways of topic assessments, we will see in the experiments that the discriminative models can still gain significant improvements from the training data. Our decision of choosing the training and testing configurations is mainly based on the number of relevance judgments available. We need a reasonable amount of training data for the discriminative models and there are relatively more relevance judgments in 2006 for W3C and in 2008 for CERC. Because the two test collections have very different characteristics, we do not evaluate the models across the corpora. To obtain a balanced training set, we randomly select the same number of negative instances with the number of positive instances for each training query, by following the undersampling method in [23]. To acquire negative instances for the queries without non-relevance judgments (i.e., 10 TREC 2005 training topics), we use the Base method introduced in Section 6.1 to identify a list of unjudged/irrelevant experts for each query. Evaluation measures are mean average precision (MAP), R-precision (R-Prec), mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and precision@5 (p@5) and precision@10 (p@10).",Y,

227,"In all our experiments, we have done minimal preprocessing in which both queries and documents are stemmed using Krovetz stemmer. We only use the ""title"" or ""query"" fields in the topics without using extra information (e.g., ""narrative""). No query expansion nor external resource is utilized.

R4 is the configuration with full applicable features for the discriminative model (the R4 configuration is the default setting in all the experiments except explicitly noted). Table 4 contains the evaluation results on the two test collections. We can see that the discriminative model consistently performs better than Base across all the feature configurations on all measures. With the full set of features (i.e., R4 vs Base), all the differences are statistically significant by two-tailed Student's t-test at 0.95 confidence level.

We find that the features listed for the two testbeds are generally different with the exception of 1 and 2, showing the importance of these two features across the corpora. An interesting observation is that the 8 feature when used on W3C has a large weight among all the document-candidate association features.

375,6.2 The Effect of the Size of Retrieved Documents,null,null
,,,
376,"Similar to Model 2, the learned discriminative model can be efficiently used on top of an existing document search engine as follows: 1) Perform a standard document retrieval run using the topic as a query and retrieve the top  documents; 2) For each candidate associated with the relevant documents, calculate the probability of relevance using Eqn. 6 on these  documents. In this section, we aim to investigate the effect of the size of documents retrieved on the performance of the discriminative model. We use LM as the document retrieval run. Figure 1 shows the MAP results by varying  on the two test collections. Note that the scales on the x-axis and y-axis differ per plot. From the figure, we can see that as  increases, the discriminative model has a similar trend with the baseline: increasing, achieving a maximum, and then flattening. On W3C, the MAP value tops after 300 documents retrieved, fewer than what the baseline needs (i.e., 400). For CERC, both models need around 50 documents for best performance. Therefore, using a subset of documents could speed up the process of expert search as the best performers use much less documents than the whole set of relevant documents. At the same time, the retrieval performance can be improved although their differences are not found statistically significant.",null,null

In this experiment, we assess the extent to which the performance of the discriminative model is affected by the choice of the underlying document retrieval model. Besides LM, another two different document retrieval methods are used (i.e., BM25 [28] and Indri [33]). Specifically, the 1 feature is replaced by these two retrieval scores respectively in the R4 configuration. Table 6 shows the MAP results of the proposed model across the three retrieval models. From the table, we can see that the results are quite similar and they are all significantly better than the baseline.

The aim is to investigate the robustness of the proposed discriminative framework with respect to the choice of specific discriminative models derived from the framework. Table 7 contains the results. From the table, we can see that all the results achieved by GMD significantly outperform the baseline. Furthermore, these results are quite similar with those achieved by the AMD (R4) model. In particular, the GMD model is generally better than AMD on CERC and worse on W3C, but the differences between GMD and AMD are not statistically significant. These results demonstrate that the proposed discriminative framework generates accurate and robust results with both types of discriminative models.",null,null

,,,
424,"In this work, we propose a discriminative learning framework and derive specific models for expert search. The main advantage of the proposed approaches is their ability to integrate a variety of document evidence and documentcandidate association features. The evaluations on two TREC Enterprise track testbeds have shown the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.",Y,
,,,
425,"There are several possibilities to extend the research in this paper. We chose ""out-of-order"" training in the experiments because more training data are available in 2006 and 2008. It would be interesting to perform the ""in-order"" experiments (i.e., training on 2005 or 2007), which would allow fair comparisons with the TREC submitted runs. The relevance judgments in 2005 and 2007 seem also more likely to be obtained in a real enterprise. In fact, lack of training data hinders the applicability of many discriminative models. On the other hand, generative models may be able to effectively utilize abundant unlabeled data. It is desirable to develop a hybrid of discriminative and generative models to obtain the best of both for expert search. In addition, in certain scenarios, pairwise comparisons between experts might be more easily collectible than the pointwise judgment for each expert. We will explore to extend the proposed discriminative learning framework to handle this type of training data.",Y,null
