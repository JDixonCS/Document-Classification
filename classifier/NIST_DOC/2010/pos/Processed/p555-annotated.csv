,,,
6,"This paper presents results comparing user preference for search engine rankings with measures of effectiveness computed from a test collection. It establishes that preferences and evaluation measures correlate: systems measured as better on a test collection are preferred by users. This correlation is established for both ""conventional web retrieval"" and for retrieval that emphasizes diverse results. The nDCG measure is found to correlate best with user preferences compared to a selection of other well known measures. Unlike previous studies in this area, this examination involved a large population of users, gathered through crowd sourcing, exposed to a wide range of retrieval systems, test collections and search tasks. Reasons for user preferences were also gathered and analyzed. The work revealed a number of new results, but also showed that there is much scope for future work refining effectiveness measures to better capture user preferences.",null,null

13,1. INTRODUCTION,null,null
,,,
14,"There is a long tradition of encouraging conducting, and researching evaluation of search systems in the IR community. A test collection and an evaluation measure are together used as a tool to make a prediction about the behavior of users on the IR systems being measured. If measurement using the collection reveals that system A is more effective than system B, it is assumed that users will prefer A over B in an operational setting. One of the striking aspects of almost all the early work in test collections is that the predictions about users implied from such measurements were rarely, if ever, validated. Given that test collections are used to simulate users, that so little validation took place is perhaps surprising.",null,null

16,"In the last ten years a series of papers employing a range of methods conducted such validation.

26,2.1 Measures rarely predict users,null,null
,,,
27,"The power to predict user preferences using a test collection and evaluation measure was first examined in the work of Hersh et al [15] who used the 14 topics and qrels of TREC 6 and 7's interactive track to determine which of two retrieval systems was significantly better. They then conducted an experiment involving 24 searchers, retrieving over six topics of TREC-8: three topics on one system, three on the other. The researchers reported that there was no significant difference in the effectiveness of the searchers when using the different systems. This work was repeated on another test collection [25] drawing the same conclusion.",null,null

28,Allan et al [4] created artificial document rankings from TREC data each with controlled levels of effectiveness. Users were,null,null

,,,

Unlike the work described above, a correlation between user behavior and test collection based evaluation measures was found, but mainly when measured differences were large. Turpin & Scholer [26] repeated the artificial document ranking method, getting thirty users to examine fifty topics. No significant difference in the time users took to find the first relevant document was found. A small significant difference in the number of relevant documents identified was observed for large differences in the MAP of the artificial ranks.",null,null
,,,
31,"Inspired by Hersh and Turpin' s method Al-Maskari et al [3] measured how well groups of users performed on two IR systems. Fifty six users searched from a selection of 56 topics. The researchers showed that test collection based measures were able to predict user behavior, and to some extent a user's level of satisfaction, however only when measured differences between the systems were large.",null,null
,,,
32,"Although test collection based work is relatively recent, there is a longer tradition of correlating user outcomes with effectiveness measures calculated on actual searching systems. Tagliacozzo [22] showed that 18% of ~900 surveyed MEDLINE users appeared unsatisfied with search results despite retrieving a large number of relevant documents. As part of a larger study, Su [21] examined correlations between precision and user satisfaction; finding no significant link. Hersh et al [14] examined medical students' ability to answer clinical questions after using a medical literature search engine. No correlation between search effectiveness measures and the quality of the student's answers was found. Huuskonen et al [16] conducted a similar medical searching experiment reporting the same lack of correlation.",null,null
,,,
33,"Smith and Kantor [20] engaged 36 users to each search 12 information gathering topics on two versions of a web search engine: one, the normal searching system and the other, a degraded version which displayed results starting from rank 300. Users weren't aware they were being shown the different versions. Although no actual effectiveness measures were taken, it is reasonable to assume that there was a significant difference in precision between the versions. However, there was no significant difference in user success in finding relevant items. Smith and Kantor reported that users of the poorer system issued more queries, which appeared to mitigate the smaller number of relevant documents retrieved in each search.",null,null
,,,
34,2.2 Measures predict user behavior,null,null
,,,
35,"Measuring users through an analysis of query logs, Joachims [17] described an experiment showing users different sets of search results; as with previous work although there were measurable differences between the quantity and rank of relevant documents, Joachims saw little difference in users' click behavior. Users given poorer search results still choose top ranked documents. He proposed an alternative approach, which was to interleave the retrieval outputs of the two systems into a single ranking and observe if users tended to click on documents from one ranking more often than the other. The results showed users consistently chose documents from the better part of the interleaved ranking. This method of giving users (unknowingly) a choice and observing their preference was repeated [18] producing similar results. In this work, small, but measurable changes in document rankings were compared, and significant differences in user",null,null
,,,
36,"behavior were observed. Further analysis of query logs to model user click behavior was conducted by many researchers, e.g. [10].",null,null
,,,
37,Thomas et al [24] described another preference methodology where two sets of search results were presented side-by-side to users who were then asked which of the two they preferred. The method was used to compare the top 10 results of Google and the (presumably worse) Google results in ranks 21-30. They reported a clear preference for the top ranked results over the lower ranked.,null,null
,,,
38,2.3 Lessons drawn from past work,null,null
,,,
39,"After reading the first set of research results, one might question the value of all test collection based research, as the only time users show any difference in behavior, success in their work, or preference for searching systems is when large differences in effectiveness between IR systems are measured. In direct contradiction to this, is the smaller body of work in the following section measuring clear preferences by users even for subtle differences in retrieval results. What might be the cause of this apparent contradiction?",null,null
,,,
40,"Smith and Kantor's work appears to be the clearest in demonstrating that if it is important for users to locate relevant documents they can cope with the burden of a poorer search engine by re-formulating their query. In addition, Joachims' work appears to show that users will often make do with poorer results. The work in Section 2.1 could be failing to observe differences across users because these two traits simply make human searchers hard to measure.",null,null
,,,
41,"As can be seen, there is only limited work using the preference based approach and to the best of our knowledge there is no work using this method to test the correlations between users and evaluations based on test collections. Further, none of the past work has addressed the more nuanced questions of whether certain evaluation measures or search tasks show better prediction of user behavior over others. Although there are a plethora of papers comparing different evaluation measures, almost without exception they report cross-measure correlations or use some form of stability statistic to imply which might be better. The only exception is Al-Maskari et al who examined correlations between user satisfaction and evaluation measures [2] finding that Cumulative Gain (CG) correlated better with user preferences than P(10), DCG and nDCG, but the experiment was based on a small sample of people.",null,null
,,,
42,"Because examination of different measures is almost unexplored, we addressed it here. With a growth of interest in search systems supporting diversity, there is as yet little research examining the predictive power of test collections in relation to diverse queries. Therefore, this paper conducted such a broad investigation into the predictive power of test collections and evaluation measures.",null,null

Given a short ill specified query, the goal of the diversity task was for participating groups to build IR systems that returned a ranked list of documents that collectively fulfilled the multiple information needs represented by the query. For the diversity track, each topic was structured as a set of subtopics, each related to a different user need [13].

In the design of the experiments here, it was judged desirable to have more explicit control over the differences between the systems being compared.

For a particular topic, a pair of runs was selected from the pool and the top ten results (showing title, snippet and URL) were shown to users along with the topic title that generated the search and the subtopic description (referred to as an ""aspect"" in the interface) that expressed the information need behind the search request (example in Figure 1). The snippets were generated using a web service from the Bing search engine. Not all ClueWeb09 collection URLs still exist, which meant that 35% of results did not have a snippet. A post hoc analysis of data showed that missing snippets did not appear to influence user preferences.",null,null

However, it was found that the users were not able to do this reliably.",null,null

No other information about the experiment was given to the users.

For every five comparisons shown to an MTurker one was a trap, which was built by pairing a run relevant to the required subtopic with a run for an entirely different topic. MTurkers who did not answer such pairings correctly had all of their answers rejected from the study (example in Figure 2). In total 342 MTurkers were used, 46 were rejected for failing a trap question (13%), which left 296 whose responses contributed to the results. We did not gather any demographic information from them. MTurkers were paid 8¢ for each block of five pairs they were shown. Many MTurkers worked on more than one block.

,,,
70,"With the growth of interest in diversity, a number of evaluation measures were proposed. These measures include Cluster Recall (CR) used in ImageCLEFPhoto 2008 [7], Clarke et al's -nDCG [11], Agrawal et al's intent aware Precision (IA-PC) [1], and Clarke et al.'s [12] novelty- and rank-biased precision (NRBP).",null,null
,,,
71,"Cluster Recall (CR) is based on the subtopic recall (or S-Recall) proposed by Zhai et al. [28] to assess diversity. The CR at a cutoff rank k, CR(k), is defined as the percentage of subtopics covered by the first k documents in a ranked list. This is a pure diversity measure, i.e. it is not affected by the number of documents covering each cluster, or by their position in the ranked list. Further, it does not incorporate any notion of document novelty within a given subtopic.",null,null
,,,
72,"Contrary to CR, both -nDCG and NRBP consider both the number of relevant documents and their rank position over the subtopics of a query. For both measures, each document is assigned a gain value that is a function of the number of subtopics",null,null
,,,
73,"the document covers, and for each subtopic, the number of documents ranked above the given document that cover the same subtopic. The variable  is used to control how important diversity is in the measure. The -nDCG metric is based on the traditional nDCG metric utilizing the aforementioned gain function, while the NRBP metric is based on Rank-Biased Precision (RBP). It is defined by replacing the traditional binary relevance of a document with the aforementioned gain. Thus, for a given subtopic, for ,""0 the two metrics do not assess the novelty of the subsequent documents that cover this subtopic, while for "",""1 they only consider relevant the first document that covers the given subtopic, ignoring all the subsequent ones.""",null,null
,,,
74,"Finally, intent aware Precision at rank k accounts for diversity and the number of relevant documents. Given a query, the precision value at cut-off k is computed for each subtopic separately (i.e. only the documents that cover the subtopic under consideration are considered relevant ­ called aspect precision) and the weighted average of the precision values is computed, with weights being the popularity of each subtopic. In the Web Track data the subtopics of a query were assumed to be equally popular.",null,null

77,3.6 Selecting the pairs to show users,null,null
,,,
78,"As seen in Section 2.1, existing research showed that differences in user performance could be measured on IR systems with large differences in search effectiveness. The challenge was in measuring user preference when searching on IR systems with far smaller differences. Therefore, the selection of run pairs to show the MTurkers focused on finding pairs that were similar to each other. There was a concern that using runs with low effectiveness could result in confusion when choosing between rankings. Therefore, topics where all runs had two or fewer relevant documents in the top ten were removed. This left thirty topics in the dataset.",null,null
,,,
79,"A search was conducted across the remaining topics to locate pairs of runs that had the same number of relevant documents in the top ten, done to ensure that the rankings were similar.

The MTurker judgments for one of the 79 pairs were gathered as follows. Each system pair displayed the two retrieval results for a search based on the query text of a particular topic. The MTurkers were asked to indicate their preference for one of the paired systems in relation to a particular subtopic. Multiple MTurkers were shown the same system/subtopic pair; although if an MTurker failed a trap question, their preference judgments were removed.

Given that these measures assess somewhat different aspects of system effectiveness, a strong correlation would indicate that better systems are good in all aspects of effectiveness assessed by these measures. A weak correlation will indicate that different users prefer different qualities of the ranked lists and the sets of users whose preferences agree with each individual measure do not fully overlap even though it so happens to be of similar size.",null,null

135,"For each measure, we considered the mean values for all systems/runs submitted to the TREC track and over all 50 queries were calculated. For each two measures, we calculated Kendall's , and the AP-correlation [27], see Table 3. Kendall's  is a function of the minimum number of pair wise adjacent interchanges needed to convert one ranking into the other. The AP-correlation is a similar metric, which however mostly accounts for the swaps towards the top of the system rankings, i.e. the disagreements over the top ranked systems. It can be seen that, there is a positive correlation among all measures, the strength of which however differs among different measures. In particular, the most correlated measures are -nDCG and NRBP. IA-PC and -nDCG are also well correlated, however, they mostly agree on the poorly performing systems as indicated by lower AP-correl.

Yet for only 50% of the pairs did MTurkers agree that the system with more relevant documents was the better one.

223,4.3 MTurker comments on differences,null,null
,,,
224,"In addition to indicating their preferences, MTurkers could also provide comments about their choices. In total, 96% of the judgments had associated comments that often indicated the reason(s) behind, or affecting, a decision. These often highlighted factors beyond the results simply having more relevant documents on a topic (informational) or a link to a required webpage (navigational). There were 11.6 words per comment, on average, and using an inductive approach to data analysis [23] comments in which the users made a specific preference (54% of those submitted, 1,307) were categorized. Fifteen classes were derived",null,null
,,,
225,560,null,null
,,,
226,"and in 88 cases, comments were assigned multiple categories, e.g. ""the left one has more useful results higher in the search"" was assigned the classes 'position' and 'number' indicating that the number of results and their position in the ranking would have likely influenced their preference judgment, see Table 9.",null,null
,,,
227,"Although these are factors which researchers often highlight as affecting relevance [8], we see these mentioned unprompted by the MTurkers in this study, again highlighting the benefit of using MTurk to gather data for this kind of study, beyond implicit feedback strategies such as query logs.",null,null
,,,
228,5. REFLECTIONS ON METHOD,null,null
,,,
229,Here we discuss using MTurk as a source of user preferences; and using preference as a means of determining the impact of search on users.,null,null
,,,
230,5.1 Quality of the MTurk data,null,null
,,,
231,"With an anonymous monetized crowd sourcing system, there is always a concern that data gathered will be overwhelmed with noise from spammers. However, evidence in our analysis such as time taken to complete tasks (median ~6 min.) of this set indicated that the majority of data was created in good faith. Indeed this gathering from hundreds of users of not only quantitative data, but also qualitative data gave this set a value that query/click logs do not have.",null,null
,,,
232,"Nevertheless there are collections of data points in the set which we do not fully understand. Unexpected user responses to search results is not uncommon: Tagliacozzo [22], surveying ~900 MEDLINE users, described how nearly 18% declared dissatisfaction with search results despite earlier indicating that a large number of relevant documents were returned in the search they were asked to judge. Alonzo described how the development of MTurk experiments required multiple iterations to ensure that MTurkers were given clear instructions on what to do and to be certain that the responses from them are given in good faith [6].",null,null
,,,
233,"The data set yielded a set of significant results on evaluation measures, but we view the method used here as a first step towards developing a more refined approach. Improvements will come not only from avoiding erroneous output from MTurkers, but also from building a more refined model of how users determine their preference for one searching system over another.",null,null
,,,
234,5.2 Does preference imply satisfaction?,null,null
,,,
235,"The ultimate aim of this and past research was to understand if differences found between IR systems based on test collections were real: with a better system, would users be able to search more effectively, achieve their goals quicker, ultimately be more satisfied? Results from past work indicated that measuring such broader outcomes were challenging as users were adept at adapting either by searching more intensively or by managing to exploit relevant but poorer output.",null,null
,,,
236,The past work showed significant differences measured in a test collection did not necessarily show practical differences in user behavior. Was this simply because there was no practical difference to measure or was there simply a challenge in the way we measure users?,null,null
,,,
237,"This and previous work showed that a preference based methodology can measure significant differences in users for relatively small differences in retrieval effectiveness. However, it",null,null
,,,
238,"is worth remembering that the side-by-side method is a simulation of search and the measurement of preference says nothing about whether users are more satisfied with their search or will achieve their information seeking tasks more effectively. One might wish to hypothesize that such a link exists, but testing that hypothesis is for future work.",null,null

292,6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK,null,null
,,,
293,The research questions posed at the start of the paper were answered through the gathering and examination of a large dataset,null,null
,,,
294,561,null,null
,,,
295,of user preferences for a wide range of different IR systems tested over many queries and query types.,null,null
,,,
296,Clear evidence was found that effectiveness measured on a test collection predicted user preferences for one IR system over another. The strength of user prediction by test collection measures appeared to vary across different search tasks such as navigational or informational queries.,null,null
,,,
297,"For diverse queries, little difference between diversity measures was found. A conventional analysis of correlation between the measures was conducted confirming that they are similar. When comparing nDCG, MRR and P(10) it was found that nDCG most effectively modeled user preferences. However, user preferences between pairs of systems where one had failed to retrieve any relevant documents were notably stronger than when both rankings had at least one relevant document, which suggests a need for adjustments to these measures to allow for this user view.",null,null
,,,
298,"Finally, an examination and grouping of the written reasons that users provided for choosing one system ranking over another was outlined. Here it was shown that although relevance, rank, and information content of the documents was an important factor when users chose one system over another, a wide range of other reasons was also provided by users. Specific web sites were sought by some; avoidance of commercial sites or documents in other languages was desired by others. Such information from the MTurkers suggested that the test collections, relevance judgments and evaluation measures could be improved to provide a more effective model of user preferences than is currently available.",null,null
,,,
299,"Such ideas are left to future work, where we will also continue to analyze our gathered data set as well as consider how to refine our collection methods to gather larger more informative sets in the future.",null,null
