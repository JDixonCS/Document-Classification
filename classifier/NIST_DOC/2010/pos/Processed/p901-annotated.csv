9,"In the biomedical domain, the desired information of a question (query) asked by biologists usually is a list of a certain type of entities covering different aspects that are related to the question [6], such as genes, proteins, diseases, mutations, etc. Hence it is important for a biomedical information retrieval (IR) system to provide comprehensive and diverse answers to fulfill biologists' information needs. In the TREC 2006 and 2007 Genomics tracks, the ""aspect retrieval"" was investigated. Its purpose was to study how a biomedical IR system can support a user gather information about the different aspects of a topic. Aspects of a retrieved passage could be a list of named entities or MeSH terms, representing answers that cover different portions of a full answer to the query. Aspect Mean Average Precision (Aspect MAP) was defined in the Genomics tracks to capture similarities and differences among retrieved passages. It is a measurement for diversity of the IR ranked list [5].",Y,null

10,"The Genomics aspect retrieval was firstly proposed in the TREC 2006 Genomics track and further investigated in the 2007 Genomics track. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not too much previous work conducted on the Genomics aspect retrieval for promoting diversity in the ranked list. University of Wisconsin re-ranked the retrieved passages using a clustering-based approach named GRASSHOPPER to promote ranking diversity [4]. Unfortunately, for the Genomics aspect retrieval, this re-ranking method hurt their system's performance and decreased the Aspect MAP of the original results [4]. Later in the TREC 2007 Genomics track, most teams tried to obtain the aspect",Y,null

15,"Survival analysis is a statistical methodology used for modeling and evaluating survival data, also called time-to-event data, where one is interested in the occurrence of events [2]. Survival time refers to a variable which measures the time from a particular starting time to a particular endpoint of interest. Events are usually referred as birth, death and failure that happen to an individual in the context of study. For example, in clinical trial, one may interested in the number of days that patient can survive in the study of the effectiveness of a new treatment for a disease. Formally, the survival function is defined as:",null,null
,,,
16,"S(t) , P r(surviving longer than time t) (1)",null,null
,,,
17,", P r(T > t)",null,null
,,,
18,"where t is a specific time, T is a random variable denoting the time of death, and ""Pr"" stands for probability. That is, the survival function gives the probability that the time of death is later than a specified time t. The survival function must be non-increasing: S(u)  S(t) if u > t. Usually one assumes S(0) ,"" 1, that is, at the start of the study, the probability of surviving past time zero is one. The survival function is also assumed to approach zero as t increases without bound [2].""",null,null
,,,
19,"In the context of information retrieval, aspects covered by a document can be considered as treatments, a document can be considered as a patient in the clinical trial case. The number of times that an aspect has been observed can be considered as the survival time. The new information that can be provided by an aspect corresponds to the effectiveness of a treatment. One can expect that, in a ranked list, as the number of times that an aspect has been observed increases, the new information that this aspect can provide to a document decreases. For example, in a ranked document list, when aspect ""stroke treatment"" is observed in the jth document at the first time, the information provided by this aspect should be counted as completely new. We presume that ""stroke treatment"" in the jth document covers the",null,null

93,"In this paper, we propose a survival modeling approach to promoting ranking diversity for biomedical information retrieval. The probabilistic survival model derived from the survival analysis theory measures the probability that novel information can be provided by an aspect with respect to its occurrences. Experimental results show that the proposed survival model can successfully capture the novel information delivered by aspects and achieve significant improvements on ranking diversity. We also show that combining the novelty and the relevance of a retrieved document at the aspect level is an effective way of promoting diversity of the ranked list, while keeping the relevance of retrieved documents. The proposed approach not only achieves promising performance improvements on the diversity based evaluation measure, but also on the relevance based evaluation measure.",null,null
