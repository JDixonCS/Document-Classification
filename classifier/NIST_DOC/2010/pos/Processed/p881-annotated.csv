16,"Reading and Commenting online news is becoming a common user behavior in social media. Discussion in the form of comments following news postings can be effectively facilitated if the service provider can recommend articles based on not only the original news itself but also the thread of changing comments. This turns the traditional news recommendation to a ""discussion moderator"" that can intelligently assist online forums. In this work, we present a framework to recommend relevant information in the forum-based social media using user comments. When incorporating user comments, we consider structural and semantic information carried by them. Experiments indicate that our proposed solutions provide an effective recommendation service.",null,null

22,"Web is one of the most important vehicles for ""social media"", e.g. Internet forums, blogs, wikis, and twitters. One form of social media of particular interest here is self-publishing. In selfpublishing, a user can publish an article or post news to share with other users. Other users can read and comment on the posting and these comments can, in turn, be read and commented on. Digg (digg.com) and Yahoo!Buzz (buzz.yahoo.com) are commercial examples of self-publishing. A useful extension of this self-publishing application is to add a recommendation feature to the current discussion thread. That is, based on the original posting and various levels of comments, the system can provide a set of relevant articles, which are expected to be of interest of the active users of the thread.",Y,null

23,"Here, we explore the problem of news recommendation for dynamic discussion threads. A fundamental challenge in adaptive news recommendation is to account for topic divergence, i.e. the change of gist during the process of discussion. In a forum, the original news is typically followed by other readers' opinions, in",null,null

27,"the form of comments. Concerns and intention of active users may change as the discussion continues. Therefore, news recommendation, if it were only based on the original posting, can not benefit the potentially changing interests of the users. Apparently, there is a need to consider topic evolution in adaptive news recommendation and this requires novel techniques that can help to capture topic evolution precisely to prevent wild topic shifting which returns completely irrelevant news to users. A related problem is content-based information filtering (or recommendation). Most information recommender systems select articles based solely on the contents of the original postings [1] [3] [4].",null,null

,,,
31,"We first model the relationship among comments and that relative to the original posting in order to evaluate their overall impact. In our model, we treat the original posting and the comments each as a text node. This model both considers the content similarity between text nodes and the logic relationship among them. On one hand, the content similarity between two nodes can be measured by any commonly adopted metric, such as cosine similarity and Jaccard coefficient. This metric is taken over every node pair in the discussion thread. On the other hand, the logic relation between nodes takes two forms. First, a comment is always made in response to the original posting or an earlier comment. In graph theoretic terms, the hierarchy can be represented as a tree  ,"" (,  ), where  is the set of all text nodes and  is the edge set. In particular, the original posting is the root and all the comments are ordinary nodes.""",null,null

These news articles with different topics are treated as the original news postings, recommended news are selected from a corpus of articles collected from Reuters news website. This simulates the scenario of recommending relevant news from traditional media to social media readers for their further reading. We compared the proposed approach to three other retrieval approaches as the baseline: one is a simple content filter (CF) which treats news and comments as a single topic profile, the other two are well-known news recommendation methods [1], Okapi and LM.",Y,null
,,,
75,"To observe the impact of readers' concerns on original news posting in social media, we investigate the effect of the three forms of relationship among comments, i.e. content similarity, reply, and quotation. We carry out a series of experiments for this purpose. we find that replies are slightly more effective than quotations and both of these outperform pure content similarity. In other words, the importance of comments can be well evaluated by the logic organization of these comments. We also notice that the incorporation of content similarity decreases the system effectiveness. This may seem to contradict our intuition that the textual information should complement the logic-based models. By further investigating our results, we find that content similarity sometimes misleads the decision on the importance of the comments. Besides, the computation cost of calculating the content similarity matrix  is very high. Therefore, we only apply the structural information to determine the importance of each comment.",null,null

As shown in Table 1, the overall performance of the proposed approach performed significantly better than the best baseline methods.",null,null

78,"In this work, we present a framework for adaptive news recommendation that incorporates information from the entire discussion thread. This study can be extended in a few interesting ways. For example, we can use this technique to process personal Web blogs and email archives. The technique itself can also be extended by incorporating such information as reader scores on comments, chronological information of comments, and reputation of users. Indeed, its power is yet to be further improved and investigated.",null,null
