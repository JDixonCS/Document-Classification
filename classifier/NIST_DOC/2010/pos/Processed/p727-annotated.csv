5,"It has been observed that precision increases with collection size. One explanation could be that the redundancy of information increases, making it easier to find multiple documents conveying the same information. Arguably, a user has no interest in reading the same information over and over, but would prefer a set of diverse search results covering multiple aspects of the search topic. In this paper, we look at the impact of the collection size on the relevance and diversity of retrieval results by down-sampling the collection. Our main finding is that we can we can improve diversity by randomly removing the majority of the results--this will significantly reduce the redundancy and only marginally affect the subtopic coverage.",null,null

14,"The TREC 2009 Web Track's Diversity Task [1] addresses the issue of redundancy by penalising systems that return the same information over and over again. Diversity puts the impact of collection size on precision in an interesting perspective. On the one hand, being topically relevant is a prerequisite for the desired results, which according to our first postulate would make a larger collection size beneficial. On the other hand, redundancy of information is harmful, which according to our second postulate would make a larger",null,null

18,"We use ClueWeb09 category B, consisting of the first 50 million English pages of the full ClueWeb09 collection and the Diversity Task's topics and relevance judgements. We indexed the collection using Indri 4.10. Common stop words are removed and the remaining terms are stemmed using Krovetz. The retrieval model is a standard language model with Jelinek-Mercer smoothing ( ,"" 0.15) and a linear length prior (proportional to the length of the document). This run is not optimised for diversity, but merely serves as a way to illustrate the phenomena under consideration. We randomly down-sample the collection, using collection samples ranging between 5% and 100% of the full collection, and repeat this experiment five times. All sample statistics and scores are averages over these five iterations. Random sampling will make the expected probability of relevance of a document the same in the sample and in the full collection. This is helpful for our analysis, but in a realistic setting collections are unlikely to grow in an unbiased way.""",null,null

20,"We will first analyse the effect of reducing the collection size on the number of relevant documents, and on the number of topics or subtopics with at least one relevant result. There are 50 Diversity topics with 180 subtopics having at least one relevant page in the ClueWeb09 category B collection. In total, there are 3,777 positive relevance judgments for 2,783 distinct pages (some pages are relevant for multiple subtopics). Figure 1 shows the fraction of relevant pages in each sample and the fraction of subtopics for which there is at least one relevant page in the sample (averaged over the five samples). What is the impact of collection size on the number of relevant documents? Obviously, with random sampling the fraction of the relevant pages increases proportionally with the collection. Our first postulate holds.",null,null

21,"What is the impact on the number of topics or subtopics with at least one relevant result? Here we see a very different pattern. Starting at 5%, the sample already contains over 40% of the subtopics. At a sample size of 30%, the collection contains relevant pages for over 80% of the subtopics. The fractions for the overall topics are even higher.",null,null

22,"Our analysis shows that the small samples already cover the vast majority of subtopics with a relatively small fraction of the relevant documents. The larger samples, in contrast, contain many more relevant documents but only few additional subtopics.",null,null

67,"We now analyse the effect of reducing the collection size on the redundancy of relevant information, and on the diversity or coverage of subtopics in the top of a retrieval run. Table 1 shows the number of relevant pages per topic and subtopic (columns 2 and 3). What is the impact of collection size on the redundancy of relevant information? The number of relevant pages and hence the redundancy steadily increases with the sample size. Eventually the collection contains many relevant document per topic and subtopic. Our second postulate also holds.",null,null

Table 1 shows the number of informational, navigational and total subtopics covered by a relevant document in the top 10 of our full-text run (columns 4, 5 and 6 respectively) when restricted to the sample. We see that initially the number of subtopics is increasing due to the increasing coverage for the smallest samples, but then peaks and tapers off due to the increasing redundancy for the larger samples.",null,null

We show the variance over the 5 sample iterations only for the -nDCG@10 and IA-P@10 to keep the figure readable. The variance is similar at rank 20. variance is largest between 20% and 30% of the collection. We see an initial increase of performance at sample sizes below 15% of the collection. After that, however, the performance doesn't increase further and remains relatively stable across sample sizes of 30% and above. In fact, the performance at rank 10 is actually decreasing. This is in line with the results in Table 1, supporting the validity of the measures.",null,null

,,,
97,"We analysed the impact of collection size on relevance, coverage, redundancy and diversity. We found that the number of relevant documents increases, but the coverage of subtopics quickly saturates. As a result the redundancy of information steadily increases leading to a lower diversity of results. This leads to the remarkable conclusion that, when result diversity is of importance, we can improve performance by randomly removing the majority of the results--this will significantly reduce the redundancy and only marginally affect the subtopic coverage.",null,null
,,,
98,"Our results are based on a standard full-text run--which does not do a very good job at retrieving diverse results--and an ideal diverse ranking would suffer from removing random results. However, it also makes a call to caution to any claim for a technique to diversify results. Any such techniques might improve in whole or in part due to an arbitrary reduction of the result-list.",null,null
