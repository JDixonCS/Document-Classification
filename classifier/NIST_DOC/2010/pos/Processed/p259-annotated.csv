7,"We present a novel framework for the query-performance prediction task. That is, estimating the effectiveness of a search performed in response to a query in lack of relevance judgments. Our approach is based on using statistical decision theory for estimating the utility that a document ranking provides with respect to an information need expressed by the query. To address the uncertainty in inferring the information need, we estimate utility by the expected similarity between the given ranking and those induced by relevance models; the impact of a relevance model is based on its presumed representativeness of the information need. Specific query-performance predictors instantiated from the framework substantially outperform state-of-the-art predictors over five TREC corpora.",Y,null

(See Section 2 for a survey.)",null,null

13,"We present a novel framework for query-performance prediction that is based on statistical decision theory. Specifically, we consider a ranking induced by a retrieval method in response to a query as a decision taken so as to satisfy the underlying information need [15]. The quality of the ranking -- i.e., query-performance -- is then estimated based on the utility it provides with respect to the presumed information need. However, there is often uncertainty about the actual",null,null

16,"To address the uncertainty in inferring the information need, we first assume a ""true"" (latent) model of relevance, e.g., a relevance language model [16] that generates terms in the query and in relevant documents.

18,"A key observation, which enables to derive effective predictors from our framework, concerns the representativeness of relevance-model estimates for the underlying information need. We argue, and empirically show, that relevance-model representativeness can be estimated using various queryperformance predictors that were originally devised to predict the quality of the document list from which the relevance model is constructed, e.g., the Clarity method [6].",null,null

21,"Query-performance predictors can be roughly categorized to pre-retrieval and post-retrieval methods [13]. Pre-retrieval methods analyze the query expression before search is performed [6, 13, 21, 19, 11, 31, 10]. Linguistic features and/or statistical properties of the query-terms distribution are often used along with some corpus-based statistics.",null,null

22,"Post-retrieval predictors analyze also the result list -- the list of documents most highly ranked in response to the query. The Clarity method [6], for example, estimates the ""focus"" of the result list with respect to the corpus, as measured by the KL-divergence between their induced (language) models. Variants of clarity were proposed for improving prediction performance [2, 7, 4, 12].",null,null

26,"Retrieval scores often reflect document-query similarity. Hence, analyzing retrieval-scores distribution can potentially help to predict query performance. Indeed, the highest retrieval score and the mean of top scores were shown to indicate query performance [25]. Query performance was also shown to be correlated with the extent to which similar documents in the result list are assigned with similar retrieval scores [8]. In addition, high retrieval scores at top ranks of the list with respect to that of the corpus [34], and large variance of retrieval scores in the list [22], were shown to indicate effective performance.",null,null

27,"We argue, and empirically show, that some post-retrieval predictors can effectively be used in our framework to estimate the extent to which relevance models [16] presumably represent the information need expressed by a query. We use state-of-the-art predictors that represent the different paradigms mentioned above, namely, the Clarity method [6], the query-feedback (QF) approach, which is based on ranking robustness [34], and the WIG [34] and NQC [22] measures that utilize retrieval scores. (See Section 3.2.2 for a discussion on these predictors.) The effectiveness of the predictors we derive from the framework is substantially better than that of using those four predictors, as originally proposed, to estimate the quality of the result list.",Y,null

28,"Some work on ranking documents in response to a query [5, 28, 24] addresses the uncertainty in inferring the information need by using multiple relevance models (or more generally, query-expansion-based models) as we propose in our framework. Furthermore, representativeness measures for relevance models have also been used [28, 24], albeit not QF, WIG, and NQC that we use here. More importantly, the task we pursue -- predicting the quality of a given document ranking -- is different than that of inducing document ranking in response to a query [5, 28, 24].",Y,

Then, according to the probability ranking principle [20], using M with RIq yields a ranking M(RIq ; D) of maximal utility (e.g., all relevant documents are positioned at the highest ranks, and all non-relevant documents are positioned below the relevant documents).

This is of utmost importance as potentially very few of the clusters contain a high percentage of relevant documents, and identifying these is a hard challenge [14]. Indeed, WIG, which is based on retrieval scores within the clusters, yields performance that is inferior under M ulti sampling to that of using uniform values for representativeness.

,,,
292,"We presented a novel framework, which is based on statistical decision theory, for predicting query performance. The quality of a given document ranking is predicted based on its expected similarity with those induced by estimates of relevance models; the presumed representativeness of a relevance-model estimate of the underlying information need determines its impact. Relevance-model representativeness is measured using state-of-the-art query-performance predictors that were originally designed to estimate the quality of the initial search. Empirical evaluation shows that predictors instantiated from our framework are substantially more effective than current state-of-the-art predictors.",null,null

342,"Table 5: The effectiveness of predictors instantiated from our framework. We vary the document-sets sampling approach, the inter-rankings similarity measure, and the representativeness (rep.) measure of the relevance model estimate; ""Uniform"" stands for using the same constant representativeness value for all relevance models. The first four rows present the performance of the representativeness measures when used to directly predict performance; percentages of improvements are with respect to these values.",null,null
