12,"Inferring the score distribution of relevant and non-relevant documents is an essential task for many IR applications (e.g. information filtering, recall-oriented IR, meta-search, distributed IR). Modeling score distributions in an accurate manner is the basis of any inference. Thus, numerous score distribution models have been proposed in the literature. Most of the models were proposed on the basis of empirical evidence and goodness-of-fit. In this work, we model score distributions in a rather different, systematic manner. We start with a basic assumption on the distribution of terms in a document. Following the transformations applied on term frequencies by two basic ranking functions, BM25 and Language Models, we derive the distribution of the produced scores for all documents. Then we focus on the relevant documents. We detach our analysis from particular ranking functions. Instead, we consider a model for precision-recall curves, and given this model, we present a general mathematical framework which, given any score distribution for all retrieved documents, produces an analytical formula for the score distribution of relevant documents that is consistent with the precision-recall curves that follow the aforementioned model. In particular, assuming a Gamma distribution for all retrieved documents, we show that the derived distribution for the relevant documents resembles a Gaussian distribution with a heavy right tail.",null,null

19,"according to some definition of relevance of each document to the user's request and returns a ranked list of documents to the user. In reality, this ranked list of documents is a mixture of both relevant and non-relevant documents. For a wide range of retrieval applications (e.g. information filtering, topic detection, meta-search, distributed IR), modeling and inferring the distribution of relevant and non-relevant documents over scores in a reasonable way can be highly beneficial. For instance, in information filtering, topic detection and recall-oriented retrieval, modeling the score distributions of relevant and non-relevant documents can be utilized to find the appropriate threshold between relevant and non-relevant documents [16, 17, 2, 19, 9, 15]. In distributed IR and meta-search it can be used to normalize document scores and combine different collections or the outputs of several search engines [5, 12].",null,null
,,,
20,"Inferring the score distribution for relevant and non-relevant documents in the absence of any relevance information is an extremely difficult task, if at all possible. Modeling score distributions is often the basis of any possible inference. Due to this, numerous combinations of statistical distributions have been proposed in the literature to model score distributions of relevant and non-relevant documents. In the 1960s and 70s, Swets attempted to model the score distributions of non-relevant and relevant documents with two Gaussians of equal variance [16], two Gaussians of unequal variance, and two exponentials [17]. Bookstein instead proposed a two Poisson model [7] and Baumgarten a two Gamma model [5]. A negative exponential and a Gamma distribution [12] has also been proposed in the literature. The dominant model has been a negative exponential for the non-relevant documents and a Gaussian for the relevant ones [2, 12, 19]. Bennett [6] observed that when using a two-Gaussians model for text classification, document scores outside the modes of the two Gaussians (corresponding to ""extremely irrelevant"" and ""obviously relevant"" documents) demonstrated different empirical behavior than the scores between the two modes (corresponding to ""hard to discriminate"" documents). This motivated him to introduce several asymmetric distributions to capture these differences. Kanoulas et al. [11] recently proposed a Gamma distribution for the non-relevant documents and a mixture of Gaussians for the relevant documents.",null,null
,,,
21,The complexity of the underlying process that generates document scores makes it hard to theoretically argue about the actual distribution of document scores. Most of the aforementioned models were proposed on the basis of empirical fits to scores produced over different document corpora.,null,null
,,,
22,242,null,null
,,,
23,"There have also been several attempts to intuitively argue about the shape of the different distributions. The starting point for most of these attempts has been some basic assumptions about the frequency of query term occurrences in documents (e.g. in Manmatha et al. [12]). Harter [10] and Bookstein and Swanson [8] used a mixture of Poisson distributions to model the distribution of words in a document, with one Poisson corresponding to the distribution of words in relevant documents and the other to the distribution of words in non-relevant documents.",null,null
,,,
24,"In a different line of work, Arampatzis and van Hameren [2] showed that the distribution of relevant document scores rapidly converges to a Gaussian via the Central Limit Theorem as the number of query terms increases, under some basic assumptions. Further, they claimed that this is not true in the case of non-relevant documents.",null,null
,,,
25,"Finally, Robertson [14] considered various combinations of distributions and examined whether these combinations exhibit anomalous behavior with respect to theoretical properties of precision and recall. Arampatzis et al. [1] proposed two truncated versions of the exponential-Gaussian model to overcome the theoretical problems associated with the original exponential-Gaussian model.",null,null

26,"In this work, we model score distributions in a rather different, systematic manner. We start with a basic assumption on the distribution of terms in a document. Following the transformations applied on term frequencies by two basic ranking functions, BM25 and Language Models, we derive the distribution of the produced scores for all documents in an analytical form and illustrate that the derived distribution can be well approximated by a Gamma distribution.",null,null
,,,
27,"Further, we also consider the score distribution for relevant documents. We detach our analysis from particular ranking functions. Instead, we consider a simple model for precision-recall curves proposed by Aslam and Yilmaz [3], which makes some very basic assumptions about the shapes of precision-recall curves that are produced by reasonable retrieval system on average. Given this model, we present a general mathematical framework which, given any score distribution for all retrieved documents, produces an analytical formula for the score distribution of relevant documents that is consistent with the precision-recall curves that follow the aforementioned model. In particular, assuming a Gamma distribution for all retrieved documents, we show that the derived distribution for the relevant documents resembles a Gaussian distribution with a heavy right tail.",null,null

28,2. FROM TERM FREQUENCIES TO RETRIEVAL SCORES,null,null
,,,
29,"Traditional retrieval models score documents based on how well their language matches the language of the user's request. Thus, the essential component of all traditional scoring functions is the number of occurrences of query terms within a document (term frequency, TF). Different retrieval models apply different transformations over the term frequencies to produce a score per query term. The final score of a document is usually an aggregate of the document scores for each individual term.",null,null

30,Before we consider the distribution of term frequencies and the transformation applied by ranking functions over them in an analytical manner we illustrate the evolution of the term frequency distribution for all retrieved documents,null,null

32,"The left panel corresponds to the transformation of TF distribution by BM25, while the right panel corresponds to the transformation by the Jelinek-Mercer Language Model.1 Each column then, in both panels, corresponds to an individual query term and each row to progressively more complex transformations of the term frequency. The bottom row plots illustrate the final score distribution by the two retrieval models.",null,null
,,,
33,"As can be observed, for both retrieval models, there is a critical step in the term frequency transformation (from Row 2 to Row 3) after which the score distribution radically changes and appears to be closer to the final score distribution. Furthermore, the shape of the final score distribution appears to be dominated by the most frequent query term in the collection (as expected) -- for the sample query this is the term talk -- and thus our main goal will be to derive the score distribution for each individual query term.",null,null

36,"For a fixed query, consider a partition of the collection into relevance classes, such that DQ is the class of documents that satisfy the information need to a certain degree Q>0. Depending on several factors like the user, the information need, the collection of documents etc, Q can take a range of values from ""completely irrelevant"" (the lowest Q) to ""extremely relevant"" (the highest Q). Note that in test collections (such as TREC) for simplicity only two or three classes are considered. The discussion in this section assumes a fixed quality/relevance class Q, and assumes all documents in the class contain all query terms at least once.",null,null
,,,
37,"A query term t has a certain contribution to the document quality in response to the user query. For a given document quality Q, we assume an approximately constant probability of seeing the term t at any position in a document in class DQ; hence we can model term t occurrences in documents in class DQ with a Poisson process with rate  , t ,"" f (g, Q), where g "","" gt relates to the general rarity of the term in the language. Such a model is memoryless and implies that the query term appears equally likely at any moment. We do not model the dependence f -- any monotonic function can be used, depending on the class model.""",null,null
,,,
38,"Counting the occurrences of a term t when reading a random document d  DQ is analogous to counting buses at a bus station: arrive at the station, wait for the first bus, for the second bus, etc., and leave at some point (when the document ends).

607,Remark on the Shape of the Distribution,null,null
,,,
608,"Most term frequency weighting functions are nonlinear monotonically increasing functions of the raw term frequency. In BM25 Roberston's TF grows fast when the raw term frequency is small and gets gradually saturated. The parameter k1 controls the speed of the saturation. The logarithm function in Language Models also has this saturation property but without the power of controlling the saturating speed. Therefore, the JM language model scoring function has a similar to BM25 impact on transforming the distribution of low level statistics, such as DL/TF or normalized TF to the final score distribution.",null,null
,,,
609,As it is illustrated in Figure 2 the typical shape of the distribution for the DL/TF tends to have a long right tail but a fast rising-up left tail. After applying a transforma-,null,null
,,,
610,246,null,null
,,,
611,"tion function with the saturation property, the imbalance between two tails of the original distribution is alleviated, so the peak of the new distribution is right shifted, and with a shorter right tail compared to the original one. The amount of difference is dominated by the parameter controlling the saturating speed. This can be viewed in Figure 5. As k1 becomes larger and the weighting function more linear the empirical histograms of BM25 looks more similar to the distribution of DL/TF in Figure 2. This implies that the term score distribution can also be approximated by a Gamma distribution by adjusting the shape and the scale parameters.",null,null

613,"In this paper we have considered scorinP g functions with the following property: score(d,query) ,"" tquery r(Xt), where Xt "","" DL/tf (t, d).

Assuming terPm independence, the intuition for the summation score "", t r(Xt) is as follows:",null,null
,,,
614,"· For non-relevant documents (low quality Q) each r(Xt) will be distributed approximately as a Gamma(low shape, low scale). If the scales are approximately equal their sum follows a Gamma distribution with the same scale (gamma distribution exhibits infinite divisibility).",null,null

615,"· For relevant documents, the mixture for each term has more effective components, thus making the sum a rich mixture, usually Gaussian like (or Gamma-like with higher scale and shape).",null,null

That the score distribution is ""Gaussian-like"" is much assumed (as discussed in the introduction), but the heavy right tail is also necessary to avoid problems with a simple Gaussian, such as those described by Manmatha et al. [12] and others. Figure 9 shows the typical form of the relevant document score distribution we obtained in TREC 8. We here for the first time derive such a form, given reasonable forms for non-relevant score distributions and precisionrecall curves.",null,null

777,"Our results in this section are descriptive rather than prescriptive, and as such, we conclude the following:",null,null
,,,
778,The tendency of the score distributions for relevant documents to look Gaussian with a heavy right tail is a natural and inevitable consequence of the facts that (1) the score distributions of non-relevant documents tend to look Gamma and (2) precision-recall curves tend to have the form shown in Figure 7.,null,null
,,,
779,6. CONCLUSIONS,null,null
,,,
780,"In this work, we attempt to model score distributions in a rather systematic manner. We start with a basic assumption that query terms are generated via a Poisson process and induced that the distribution the relative term frequency in a document is a inverse Gamma distribution. Following the mathematical transformations applied on the relative term frequencies by two basic ranking functions, BM25 and Language Models, we derived the distribution of the produced scores, in an analytical form and illustrate that the derived distribution can be well approximated by a Gamma distribution. Further, we also considered the score distribution for relevant documents by relating score distributions with precision-recall curves. In particular, we adopted a precision-recall curve model that has previously been proposed and given this model we presented a general mathematical framework under which given any score distribution for all retrieved documents we can derive an analytical formula for the score distribution of relevant documents. The framework is general enough such that the same derivations can be repeated for different models of precision recall curves. Finally, under the assumption that non-relevant documents follow a Gamma distribution for all retrieved documents, we show that there is a tendency of the derived distribution for the relevant documents to look Gaussian with a heavy right-hand tail.",null,null
