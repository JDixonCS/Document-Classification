11,"10,""Smart phones and tablets are rapidly becoming our main method of accessing information and are frequently used to perform on-thego search tasks. Mobile devices are commonly used in situations where a ention must be divided, such as when walking down a street. Research suggests that this increases cognitive load and, therefore, may have an impact on performance. In this work we conducted a laboratory experiment with both device types in which we simulated everyday, common mobile situations that may cause fragmented a ention, impact search performance and a ect user perception."",null,null",null,null
12,"11,""Our results showed that the fragmented a ention induced by the simulated conditions signi cantly a ected both participants' objective and perceived search performance, as well as how hurried they felt and how engaged they were in the tasks. Furthermore, the type of device used also impacted how users felt about the search tasks, how well they performed and the amount of time they spent engaged in the tasks. ese novel insights provide useful information to inform the design of future interfaces for mobile search and give us a greater understanding of how context and device size a ect search behaviour and user experience."",null,null",null,null

Almost all smart phone owners (97%) use their devices to access the Internet, many of whom search for information, and to complete fairly complex retrieval tasks: 62% have used them to look up information about a health condition; 57% to do a search for real estate and 40% to look up government services [35]."",null,null",null,null
21,"20,""People use mobile devices to search the web in a variety of di erent contexts - on public transport, while walking from place to place [17, 23, 33] or in social contexts, where the presence of others can cause distraction [8]. Interaction with such devices is achieved via touch screens upon which small """"so bu ons"""" are drawn for users to select items and input text. Although these bu ons may be easy to accurately press in an ideal environment, e.g. when seated, such small and non-tactile targets can be signi cantly more di cult to interact with in other situations [4].

In fact, concentration on a mobile task while walking even has an e ect on how we walk; to compensate the brain subtly (and subconsciously) alters stance and gait [34]. As such, using a mobile device whilst walking requires both cognitive and motor abilities and so users must divide their a ention between the two tasks [21], meaning either an increase in cognitive load, a decrease in pace, a decrease in task performance or a combination of these [22]. e level of di culty experienced may additionally be in uenced by the device size and type and the amount of encumbrance it itself causes [5, 12]."",null,null",null,null

33,"32,""Improvements in mobile technologies in recent years have led to a dramatic change in how and when people access and use information, and has """"a profound impact on how users address their daily information needs"""" [7]. Research shows that as the power of these devices - as well as the amount of screen space they afford - increases, the complexity of tasks people use them for also increases, with mobile search sessions becoming longer and less homogeneous [19]. Many people now use their smart devices in di erent contexts to nd information, keep up to date with news or to alleviate boredom [35] and frequently use them whilst walking or on public transport. is relatively novel situation of interacting with a computing device when non-stationary can be distracting as a ention must be shared (or """"fragmented"""") between operating the device and maintaining motility, typically necessitating a change in posture, stance and gait [34]."",null,null",null,null
34,"33,""A large body of work has investigated user contexts and how fragmented a ention a ects user input on mobile devices. Early work designed and evaluated forms of human computer interaction in xed, non-fragmented contexts of use, in a single domain such as a lab [16]. As mobile research evolved, studies began to investigate situations in which a ention is diverted from the interface. Oulasvirta et al. found that when following a pre-de ned, but otherwise uncontrolled, route through a city users experienced signi cant impairment when compared with a """"non-social laboratory condition"""" [30]. In a more controlled set of experiments, Lin et al. [23] demonstrated that error rates of stylus input significantly increased as the amount of distraction, and thus degree of a ention fragmentation, increased. Similar e ects were later demonstrated for touch-based input, with error rates increasing in line with walking speed [28]."",null,null",null,null
35,"34,""Early investigations of reading comprehension and word search when walking [3] showed that contextual variations can have large e ects on user behaviour, impairs performance and increases task workload. Mizobuchi et al. looked into mobile text entry and found additional workload e ects when walking and identi ed walking"",null,null",null,null
36,"35,""speed as a secondary measure of mental workload [24]. ey concluded that texting whilst walking results in either a reduction in input speed (but not accuracy) or a reduction in walking pace. Large-scale analysis of mobile search logs [18] has shown that the increase in time required for mobile searches deters some types of search behaviour, such as exploratory search, and causes search sessions to be considerably shorter than in desktop search. ese lines of investigation concluded that times increased signi cantly when walking compared to a si ing condition, search behaviour altered whilst mobile and walking speed when texting reduces by a xed amount independent of the level of input di culty, which varied between participants. ese types of investigative conditions create situational impairments which fragment a users' a ention, exerting a range of e ects on performance and creating compelling opportunities for research [20]."",null,null",null,null
37,"36,""Interaction with such devices is commonly achieved via touch screens upon which relatively small """"so bu ons"""" are drawn for users to select items and input text. e examination of so bu ons, hardware bu ons, and surface gestures under conditions of medium and high distraction found that marking menus (i.e. directional gestures) activated along a smartphone's bevel provided the fastest response time [4, 26]. While these bu ons may be easy to accurately press in an ideal environment, such as when seated, such small and non-tactile targets may be much more di cult to interact with in other distracting situations [4]. Other investigations assessed the e ects of walking on performance with so bu ons, a empting to quantify the negative e ects on use due to walking and exploring design changes that may improve a user's experience with a mobile device [20]."",null,null",null,null
38,"37,""Screen real-estate on a mobile device also creates interaction di culties as a user moves, combined with increasing complexity of mobile task, resulting in considerable obstacles [5, 6, 13]. e limited input modalities a orded by mobile devices have a negative e ect on usability [13], a problem compounded by screen size and the device's reduced ability to present information and navigational cues [5, 6]. Small screens can easily become clu ered with information and widgets (bu ons, menus, windows, etc.) and this presents a di cult challenge for interface designers [5]. Use of larger devices, such as tablets, which have correspondingly larger screens, may mitigate some of these issues and result in notably di erent modalities of use [25]."",null,null",null,null
39,"38,""Research shows that smart phones and tablets are o en used for di erent tasks [25, 31] and an analysis of query logs [36] suggests that querying behaviour di ers between tablet and smart phone users. Furthermore, there may be a negative correlation between screen size and perceived task di culty and experienced workload [12], although it has not been investigated when comparing smart phones and tablets and it is unknown what e ect situational context has, if any. In general, li le is known about the impact di erences between the devices has on user behaviour, perceptions and performance on retrieval tasks and under varying mobile conditions."",null,null",null,null

Earlier work [9] by the same authors showed that time pressure leads to more queries being issued, fewer documents being viewed and less focus on examination of documents and SERPs. Recent work [15] has demonstrated that users perceive a similar increase in search task di culty and reduction in satisfaction of their own performance when put under more distracting experimental conditions. ese e ects are likely as a result of the increased cost of complex cognitive tasks under such conditions, leading to a modi cation in behaviour as explained by the search models and studies of Azzopardi et al. [2]."",null,null",null,null
45,"44,""Indeed, distractions during walking, driving, and other realworld interactions can preoccupy users [30], reducing their e ectiveness in interacting with the UI [4, 23] and resulting in a larger number of misspelled queries and an a empt by users to shorten queries [32, 33]. Walking whilst using a mobile device requires both cognitive and motor abilities and users must divide their attention between the two tasks [21]. is means either an increase in cognitive load, a decrease in pace, a decrease in task performance or a combination of these [22]. ere are many examples of distracted input on smart phones where users must split their a ention between the task of navigating their physical environment and navigating information on the smart phone screen [26]. It could even be interpreted that users are performing tasks inside a bubble, ipping back and forth between the information on the screen and the outside world [17]. Given that today's users are more likely to be mobile when they search for information online, a deeper understanding of their interactions and challenges whilst mobile will help understand situational search behaviour and the in uences of these fragmentations on search."",null,null",null,null

Since larger screens appear less clu ered with information, users may have felt less overwhelmed by the amount of information presented on the relatively more spacious tablet screen [5]. ese ndings are in line with those of Hancock et al.

252,"251,""e variation in the amount of time spent on tasks (baseline users spend longer on the tablet than the phone, with the situation reversed for the other conditions) is interesting and perhaps speaks to the di erence in weight (and therefore experienced encumbrance) between the two devices. Increased encumbrance has been shown to result in reduced input accuracy and increased mental load [27] and may lead to users more rapidly becoming fatigued, which would explain their propensity to give up the tasks earlier on the tablet when walking. When choosing between devices for a given task, it may therefore be useful to consider whether or not the user is likely to be moving or seated."",null,null",null,null

254,"253,""e main aim of this study was to investigate how di erent mobile situational contexts and di erent mobile devices (i.e. phones and tablets) a ect user performance and experience when performing web search tasks. We conducted a laboratory experiment with 24 participants in which three di erent conditions were simulated: si ing at a table (the baseline), walking on a treadmill and navigating an obstacle course. Analysis of subjective measures, derived from pre- and post-task questionnaires, as well as objective performance metrics showed that both the context and device variables had a number of e ects on performance, both perceived and measured, as well as participants' feelings of immersion, satisfaction and urgency."",null,null",null,null
255,"254,""Our results provide useful insights to inform the design of future interfaces for mobile search and give us a greater understanding of how context and device size a ect search behaviour and user experience. It is clear that some contexts have negative e ects on user search experience and that this is additionally a ected by device type. When seated, tablets are preferable for complex search tasks, however this is reversed in instances where the advantage of the device's extra screen space is o set by its additional weight (and therefore, the extra encumbrance experience by the user)."",null,null",null,null
256,"255,""ese insights suggest the need for more care to be taken when designing mobile search interfaces by considering the context in which the system will be used, as well as the type of device. Interfaces could be developed that adapt when a walking-like motion is detected to aid the user in generating queries and to present information in a terser, more focused manner to reduce mental load and simplify the information space. is work also has potential repercussions for IR and HCI researchers: When designing and evaluating mobile search systems, it is clear that whether the user is in motion and the combination of device size and weight and situational context have signi cant e ects on perception. It is also clear from this work that a treadmill may not always be appropriate for simulating mobile search as in reality users adjust their walking speed to prioritise interaction with the device, something which is not possible under this condition. erefore, practitioners should be aware of these factors to ensure that these insights are incorporated into study design and taken into account when assessing user performance so that results are in fact demonstrative of e ects induced by the experimental conditions and not other unmeasured variables."",null,null",null,null

262,"261,""initial thinking match reality and can we con rm our suspicions that the tablet's weight and bulk is the main cause of the di erences observed in this research? We intend to develop search interfaces that adapt to the user's situation (i.e. walking or not) and the device type and to investigate whether these changes can in fact aid users in fragmented contexts to query as well as those who are seated. We would also like to simulate other situations that induce a ention fragmentation, such as a busy restaurant or bar, and determine whether or not this causes similar changes in user behaviour and performance."",null,null",null,null
