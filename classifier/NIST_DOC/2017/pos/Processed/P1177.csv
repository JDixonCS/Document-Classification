11,"10,""With the availability of location-based social networks (LBSNs), such as Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Foursquare, users can share check-in data using their mobile devices. LBSNs collect valuable information about users' mobility records with check-in data including user context and feedback, such as ratings and reviews.

19,"18,2 RELATED WORK,null,null",null,null
20,"19,""Much work has been done to show that user data from LBSNs can signi cantly improve the e ectiveness of a context-aware recommender system. Several rating-based collaborative ltering approaches have been proposed in the literature, which are based on nding common features among users' preferences and recommending venues to people with similar interests. ese models are usually based on matrix factorization, exploiting check-in data for recommending places, such as the studies reported in [7, 10]. Factorization Machines generalize matrix factorization techniques to leverage not only user feedback but also other types of information, such as contextual information in LBSNs [13]. Also, some studies follow a review-based strategy, building enhanced user pro les based on their reviews [1]. When a user writes a review about a venue, there is a wealth of information which reveals the reasons why that particular user is interested in a venue or not. For example, Chen et al. [6] argued that reviews are helpful to deal with the sparsity problem in LBSNs. Our work consists of di erent similarity scores each of which is aimed at capturing a di erent aspect of information. More speci cally, our work combines information from venues content and online reviews."",null,null",null,null
21,"20,""Another line of research tries to incorporate the contextual data to enhance the performance of a recommender system. Levi et al. [14] developed a weighted context-aware recommendation algorithm to address the cold start problem for hotel recommendation.

29,"28,""e TREC Contextual Suggestion track [11] aimed to encourage the research on context-aware venue recommendation. In fact, the task was to produce a ranked list of venue suggestions for each user in a new city, given the user's context and history of preferences in 1-2 other cities. e contextual dimensions were the duration of the trip, the season in which the trip takes place, the type of the trip (i.e., business, holiday, and other), and the type of group with whom the user is traveling (i.e., alone, friends, etc.). ese contextual dimensions were introduced in the track in 2015. Since then, among the top runs, few approaches were trying to leverage such information. Yang and Fang [17] introduced some handcra ed rules for ltering venues based on their appropriateness to a user's current context. As they showed in their paper, applying such"",null,null",null,null

31,"30,""Manotumruksa et al. [15] proposed a set of categorical, temporal, and term-based features to train a set of classi ers to predict contextual appropriateness of venues. We believe that such features are very speci c to their dataset and problem and not all of them can be generalized to similar problems. Moreover, similar to our work, they collected the classi cation dataset using crowdsourcing, however, since they asked the workers to assess the appropriateness of a speci c venue to a particular user context, this could result in biased assessments.

40,"39,""In this section, we discuss the contextual features we used to train a classi er to predict contextual appropriateness of venues. As features, we consider the appropriateness of each contextual dimension to a venue category. For example, assume we have a venue with category nightlife-spot, and we want to see if it is appropriate for an example context: trip type: holiday, group type: family, trip duration: weekend. We take the degree of appropriateness of the venue category with each of the contextual dimensions as features. Let Fapp (cat, cxt ) be a function returning the degree of appropriateness of a venue category, cat, to a contextual dimension, cxt, ranging from -1 to +1.

41,"40,""Determining such features may seem intuitive, however, we argue that in many cases determining the output of function Fapp (cat, cxt ) can be very challenging.

On the other hand, de ning such features is not as intuitive as other ones: Fapp (o ce, with -friends), Fapp (food-and-drink-shop, business-trip), or Fapp (stadium, night-out-trip). Based on this observation, we classify the features into two classes: objective and subjective. As the terms suggest, objective features are those that are easily determined and are more objective. erefore, they can in uence a user's decision of visiting a venue or not. As in the previous example, supposedly, going to a nightlife spot with a family is not appropriate; hence, the user would not go to a nightlife spot even though he/she might like nightlife spots in general. erefore, objective features have a direct impact on users' decisions. Subjective features, in contrast, are less discriminative for they depend on each user's opinion and personal preferences."",null,null",null,null
