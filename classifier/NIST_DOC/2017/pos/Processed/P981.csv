14,"13,""People tend to type short queries, however, the belief is that longer queries are more e ective. Consequently, a number of a empts have been made to encourage and motivate people to enter longer queries. While most have failed, a recent a empt -- conducted in a laboratory setup -- in which the query box has a halo or glow e ect, that changes as the query becomes longer, has been shown to increase query length by one term, on average. In this paper, we test whether a similar increase is observed when the same component is deployed in a production system for site search and used by real end users. To this end, we conducted two separate experiments, where the rate at which the color changes in the halo were varied. In both experiments users were assigned to one of two conditions: halo and no-halo. e experiments were ran over a y day period with 3,506 unique users submi ing over six thousand queries. In both experiments, however, we observed no signi cant di erence in query length. We also did not nd longer queries to result in greater retrieval performance.

19,"18,""Providing a more detailed and richer description of an information need by issuing a longer query has been considered as a fundamental way for users to indicate to the system what is relevant [7].

We also nd that longer queries, in this context, do not necessarily result in be er retrieval performance. We hypothesize that for the query halo e ect to take hold, the retrieval performance needs to be positively correlated with query length and the search task needs to be complex as in [2]."",null,null",null,null
26,"25,2 BACKGROUND,null,null",null,null
27,"26,""Numerous studies have examined the length of queries submi ed by users to search systems in a number of di erent se ings. For Web-based queries the average number of terms is around 2.3 (2.35 Excite logs [13], 2.34 AOL logs [3], 2 (mode) MS logs [6]), while site search queries tend to be slightly shorter with a term length around 2.2 (2 (mode) UTennesse log [14] and 2.2 U.S. Government logs [9]). Since queries are typically short in the Web se ing, a driving hypothesis for leading people to longer queries is based on the strong assumption that: longer queries result in be er retrieval performance. However, in previous works [2, 7, 8, 11] this was not explicitly tested. In [4], Azzopardi studied the relationship between query length and retrieval performance (mean average precision) in the context of ad-hoc search on a number of TREC test collections using best match retrieval algorithms. In this simulated batch setup, performance does increase, but at a diminishing rate of return; queries of 2 to 3 terms in length result in the highest rate of return. With respect to the previous and present study on leading people to longer queries, the analysis con rmed that query length and performance are positively correlated, but only in a speci c context. Production search systems, however, o en use strategies beyond best match algorithms ­ typing more query terms o en reduces the number of results returned as terms are implicitly ANDed together."",null,null",null,null

32,"31,""Karlgren and Franze´n [11] were one of the rst to try and lead people to longer queries in a laboratory setup by changing the query input design. ey modi ed the single-line query input box used by Web search engines and designed a query text box with multiple lines, such that the query terms would wrap as you typed ­ in the belief that this would illicit longer queries than the single-line query box. In the context of Web search, Karlgren and Franze´n found indeed that participants entered signi cantly longer queries using the multi-line input box. Belkin et al. [7] later hypothesized that this increase in query length was due to: (i) the larger perceived space and (ii) the visibility of the entire query (as in the single-line condition the query could be partially hidden if it is too long)."",null,null",null,null
33,"32,""Belkin et al. [7] a empted to replicate Karlgren and Franze´n's nding in a slightly di erent context and also explored whether instructing users to enter questions as their query as opposed to key words, would lead to longer queries. In the context of a lab-based se ing (as part of the TREC interactive track), their results showed that when participants were in the """"instruction"""" condition, they submi ed signi cantly longer queries. is is not too surprising, because turning a query for """"Gar eld"""" into a question will require at least one more term, e.g. """"Who is Gar eld?"""". Interestingly, they were unable to reproduce Karlgren and Franze´n's nding with respect to the di erent query box input modes. ey found no di erence between the multi-line and single line query box modes."",null,null",null,null
34,"33,""Belkin et al. [8] then followed up, by designing an experiment where the baseline interface was a multi-line query box and the experimental condition which used the same interface but included instructions to the participants: """"Information problem description (the more you say, the be er the results are likely to be)"""". is instruction led the lab study participants in the experimental condition to enter on average two more query terms than the participants in the control condition."",null,null",null,null
35,"34,""Agapie et al. [2] hypothesized that a halo around the query box that re ects the length of the query being created could mitigate people's tendency to issue short queries. Speci cally, they further hypothesized that this halo e ect would """"nudge"""" people to type in more query terms. In their experiments, they set up a 2x2 factorial design, where on one dimension they included a halo vs. no-halo, and on the other dimension they provided instructions vs. no instructions. In the instruction condition, the 61 lab study participants were told that, """"[the] system performs be er with longer queries."""" Agapie et al. found the halo to lead the participants to construct signi cantly longer queries. However, drilling down, this was most pronounced when the halo was present, but no instructions (6.6 query terms on av.). When the halo and instructions were provided, they did not observe any signi cant increase in query length (4.5 query terms on av.). When only instructions were provided it resulted in longer queries (5.3) when compared to no halo and no instruction (4.2). In a subsequent experiment, they compared four conditions: no-halo, halo (pink to blue), inverted halo (blue to pink) and a static halo (blue). Again, they observed that the halo e ect (pink to blue) resulted in signi cantly longer queries than no halo or a static halo. However the inverted halo did not lead people to signi cantly longer queries."",null,null",null,null
36,"35,""In the aforementioned studies, performance, in terms of precisionrecall based measures, is not reported or considered, so it is actually unclear whether an increase in query length would translate into improved performance ­ and thus increased satisfaction for the user. In a recent theoretical cost-bene t analysis of query length and retrieval performance Azzopardi and Zuccon [5] show that in order for users to increase their query length either the retrieval performance needs to increase or the cost of entering terms needs to be reduced. In previous works on leading people to longer queries, neither the performance of the system is increased, nor is the cost of entering a query reduced. As such, their theory suggests that in practice larger query boxes or halo e ects, which do not modify either of these, are not going to lead to longer queries."",null,null",null,null
