We found that sub-corpora are a signi cant e ect. e consideration of which allows us to be more accurate in estimating what systems are signi cantly di erent.

486,"485,""We nd that sub-corpora are a signi cant e ect on system e ectiveness. While past work has indicated such an e ect exists, to the best of our knowledge, this is the rst time such an e ect has been integrated into a e ectiveness model and e ect sizes compared to other known factors. We nd that di erent evaluation measures are affected in di erent ways by sub-corpora, which may impact on what systems are considered signi cantly di erent to each other. We found that ranking systems using sub-corpora reasonably agrees with ranking systems with respect to a whole collection but using the information about sub-corpora allows a more accurate estimation of which systems are signi cantly di erent."",null,null",null,null
487,"486,is is initial work. We recognize that the number of topics in our collections is small. We next plan to understand the impact of di erent kinds of sub-corpora. We also plan to extend the present methodology to study the impact of di erent collections on system performance rather than sub-corpora within one collection.,null,null",null,null
