While current search engines, following a """"search by query"""" paradigm, are generally su cient when the information need is well-de ned in the searcher's mind, examining search results remains a necessary step within a larger information seeking process [23, 25]. To elaborate, Searching requires the user to translate an information need into queries, while Browsing accommodates the knowledge gap between what the user is able to communicate and what the system requires to nd the desired information. is"",null,null",null,null

19,"18,""is paper focuses on the design of tools to support browsing. Researchers note that, while search interfaces must support query formulation and an e ective ranking algorithm, browsing interfaces require e ective representations of search results to accommodate searcher's `state of knowledge' and provide `information scent' to guide the user during navigation [31, 32]. Related to this observation of `information scent' is the observation that information seekers o en express a desire for a user interface that organizes search results into meaningful structures to facilitate browsing and understanding of the retrieved results [15]."",null,null",null,null
20,"19,""e desire for browsing support via structure has given rise to interfaces that represent the structure of information. ese structures typically exist in one of two forms: hierarchies and networks [11]. First, information can be presented into hierarchies based on categories. Included in this class of search results organizations are techniques such as faceted browsing or automatic clustering. Second, alongside hierarchies, entity relationship or network representations are also used. In these representations, rather than clustering objects into labeled categories, the connections between objects (people, places, things, etc.) in a document corpus represent a relationship between two items. ese network representations include knowledge graphs [18] and concept maps [29]."",null,null",null,null
21,"20,""Recent work has explored the relative bene ts of hierarchies and networks and has noted that the bene ts are largely complementary: hierarchies provide users with some understanding of central topics, allowing them to develop a be er overview of information; whereas networks allow people to glean concrete information from the representation rather than needing to extensively read individual documents [39]. Given the complementary advantages of knowledge graphs and hierarchies, our main research question in this paper is that whether we can algorithmically generate a seamless data structure that combines the advantages of both hierarchies and networks into a single uni ed structure."",null,null",null,null

28,"27,In this section we survey related work in classifying and understanding web search and in techniques to augment search results.,null,null",null,null
29,"28,2.1 Understanding web search,null,null",null,null
30,"29,""ere exist several characterizations of web search queries [6­8, 35, 44]. Marchionini [24] focuses speci cally on a process he terms exploratory search. Marchionini de nes three categories of web search: Look-up, Learn, and Investigate and groups Learn and Investigate tasks under the umbrella of exploratory search."",null,null",null,null
31,"30,""Learn and Investigate tasks involve sensemaking [14, 36]. Sensemaking is the process of searching for a representation and encoding data in that representation to answer task-speci c questions [36]. Russell et al. [36] present four main cognitive stages that are involved in sensemaking: an interaction between a bo om-up `Search for representation' phase and a top-down representation instantiation phase, a phase of shi ing representations to t newly discovered data into the current representation, and an application of the representation to the user's speci c task."",null,null",null,null
32,"31,""e top-level representation that results from sensemaking has many di erent names: a """"holistic cognitive structure"""" [42], a mindmap, a concept map [29]. Regardless, the construction of this representation must be either provided explicitly by the interface or constructed implicitly by the user [36, 42] before the user can fully """"make sense"""" of the retrieved information."",null,null",null,null
33,"32,""Alongside the distinction between """"look-up"""" and exploratory search, there are also varying levels of complexity associated with exploratory search tasks [24]. At the simplest level, one might simply wish to read a document to understand a topic. However, consider tasks such as comparing two di erent diets to understand health bene ts (e.g. oriental and Mediterranean), comparing two di erent political systems to understand relative authoritarianism (e.g. President of Russia versus Iran), or comparing two di erent educational systems to understand relative student success (e.g. British versus Canadian). All of these, as examples of exploratory search tasks, require both searching and browsing to identify information, acquire knowledge, and contrast related data across two contexts. As the complexity of comparison increases (three or more alternatives, more abstract concepts), the information seeking task continues to increase in complexity. Searching is highly e ective at identifying relevant documents to guide basic exploratory search, but browsing and reformulating are needed to fully acquire and synthesize knowledge [23, 26]. erefore, understanding both searching and browsing behaviors are of vital importance to design e ective interactive information retrieval systems."",null,null",null,null
34,"33,2.2 Organizing Search Results,null,null",null,null
35,"34,""Because of the importance of structure in search, there have been e orts to contrast strengths and weaknesses of di erent spatial representations and groupings of search results. A taxonomy of techniques for organizing search results was proposed by Wilson et al. [46]. ey identify two main classes of approaches: (1) Coupling results with additional metadata and classi cations such that"",null,null",null,null
36,"35,""searchers can interact and control the presentation of results. (e.g. faceted browsing or categories), or (2) providing alternative or complementary representations of search results (e.g, a network representation). Wilson et al. also present four common approaches to structured classi cation [46]: hierarchical classi cations, faceted classi cations, automated clustering, and social classi cations."",null,null",null,null
37,"36,""Looking rst at structured classi cation, early forays into the domain of structuring search results contrasted categories with automatic clustering to support search. Hearst [16] showed that categories, because they were more interpretable for the user, captured important information about the document but became unwieldy when the document corpus was too large. Clusters, by comparison, were highly variable with respect to quality and were o en less meaningful for the user."",null,null",null,null
38,"37,""Given the lack of intuitiveness associated with clustering [17] and a desire for understandable hierarchies in which categories are presented at uniform levels of granularity [33, 34], alongside speci ed hierarchies such as tables-of-contents, researchers have explored faceted categories, i.e. categories that are semantically related to the search task of the user, to organize search results."",null,null",null,null
39,"38,""ese include systems that de ne faceted categories [48], research that studies the use of facets to support browsing [9], and research that identi es strengths and weaknesses of faceted browsers [45]. In terms of strengths and weaknesses, faceted browsing has proven bene cial for users already clear about their search task [45]; additional information on interactions between facets (e.g. inter-facet relationships) is helpful when users are unfamiliar with a domain and need `sensemaking'. In other words, exploratory tasks (e.g.learning or investigating [24]) are precisely those tasks where interactions between facets are needed."",null,null",null,null
40,"39,""e need to represent relationships between facets or concepts has given rise to the use of network structures to depict relationships between concepts or entities in a corpus. ese network structures include concept maps, knowledge graphs, and other entity-relationship diagrams. Concept mapping has been widely used in education as a method for knowledge examination, sharing, and browsing [10, 29]. Knowledge graphs have been popularized by Google to represent web-based information. One drawback to network structures is it is hard both to get an overview of an information network and to navigate through the network e ectively: users are easily """"lost"""" in these systems [12, 22, 31]."",null,null",null,null
41,"40,""A nal question within this space is how competing representations fare in presenting results for exploratory search tasks. While some past research has explored using questionnaires to determine the e cacy of di erent knowledge representations [30], or has evaluated the e cacy of hierarchies, networks, or concept maps with respect to ordered lists (e.g. [1, 9, 10, 27, 38]), we have found li le research that directly compares networks to hierarchies to understand their competing a ordances. e one exception to this is recent work by Sarrafzadeh et al. [39]; they nd that networks eliminate the need for reading documents ­ users can glean information from the networks with statistically signi cantly less time spent reading ­ and that hierarchies particularly bene t low-knowledge participants by giving them an e ective overview of the domain."",null,null",null,null

We have found li le work that explores combined networks+hierarchies. Part of the challenge may arise from the complexity of seamlessly integrating both hierarchies and networks into a single uni ed structure. For example, hierarchies are typically best when the structure aligns well with the user's task, but, given this alignment, entities in networks may have many multiple `parents' within the structure, yielding a many-to-many relationship within the hierarchy, i.e. a three-dimensional graph."",null,null",null,null

47,"46,""In this section, we describe hierarchical knowledge graphs, an extension of knowledge graphs that include hierarchical information about the lower level graphical structures. e rationale behind our proposed approach for employing hierarchical knowledge graphs to represent search results is the complementary bene ts [39] of hierarchies [17, 47] and network structures [2, 29, 38] to support exploratory browsing of search results. More speci cally, hierarchies provide a breadth- rst exploration of the information that allows the user to iteratively reduce confusion, obtain an overview, and slowly exploit detail. ey thus provide a structured way to navigate from more general concepts to more ne grained data and are valuable when people feel a need to orient themselves. In contrast network structures allow users to glean more information from the representation (document reading time is reduced), are more engaging, yield more control over exploration at the lower level of inter-concept relationships [39], and are more similar to one's mental model [3, 11, 28, 39]."",null,null",null,null
48,"47,""Given the complimentary bene t of networks and hierarchies, the next question is how to design a representation that can seamlessly merge these two representations. We take the approach that a knowledge graph will be an appropriate low-level representation and seek to incorporate a hierarchical view of this low-level representation of corpus content.

While preserving the entire knowledge graph, we alpha-blend all nodes in the knowledge graph except those nodes directly related to the central concept from the minimap. Recall that the central concept is simply a high-degree vertex from the knowledge graph; therefore, the central concept and all its linked nodes are shown saturated.

First, the user can move between the layers of Collection View and the Document View smoothly through a zooming functionality that changes the focus of the UI (see Figure 2).
