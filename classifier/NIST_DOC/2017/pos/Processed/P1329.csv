11,"10,Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the practice of making clinical decisions based on rigorous scienti c evidence. EBM relies on e ective access to peer-reviewed literature -- a task hampered by both the exponential growth of medical literature and a lack of e cient and e ective means of searching and presenting this literature. is paper describes a search engine speci cally designed for searching medical literature for the purpose of EBM and in a clinical decision support se ing.,null,null",null,null

15,"14,""While there are mature resources for searching medical literature (PubMed being a widely used example), these are primarily focused on retrieving literature for research purposes, not for clinical decision support. Research on how clinicians (doctors, nurses or other health professionals) search in a clinical decision support se ing [2] has shown that clinicians pose queries within three common clinical tasks: i) searching for diagnoses given a list of symptoms; ii) searching for relevant tests given a patient's situation; and iii) searching for the e ective treatments given a particular condition. An e ective search engine should facilitate interactions that support these three tasks. Doing so would lead to improved retrieval e ectiveness and a more economic interaction with the search engine and, ultimately, improved clinical decisions for patients."",null,null",null,null

21,"20,""In the indexing phase, medical articles are fed to a task extraction process that annotates mentions of diagnoses, tests and treatments. Task extraction is achieved by rst identifying mentions of medical concepts using a medical information extraction system [13]. e identi ed medical concepts are then mapped to higher level semantic types (e.g., the concept """"Headache"""" belongs to the semantic type """"Sign or Symptom""""). Each semantic type can then be mapped to one of the three clinical tasks, diagnosis, treatment or test, by consulting the i2b2 challenge guidelines [15] which de ne a mapping between semantic types and clinical tasks. Once the tasks are identi ed, the original span of text from the article is annotated with details of the task type. A sample text, with annotated spans, is shown in Figure 2."",null,null",null,null

24,"23,""When a clinician poses a clinical query, they would typically be provided with a long list of search results.

25,"24,""nd when examining the search results. In addition, when these summaries are interactive (e.g., the searcher can drill-down on speci c tests or treatments) then they are provided with an easy mechanism to navigate the information space. To facilitate such interactions we implement the following retrieval strategy. Given a set of search results, we estimate signi cant diagnoses, tests and treatments. is is done by scoring each mention of a diagnosis, test or treatment (which can comprise of more than one terms) according to its frequency of appearance within the set of search results (foreground probability) vs. the frequency it appears within the collection as a whole (background probability).1 e top ve diagnoses, tests and treatments are displayed to the searcher (along with the regular search results for that query). Given an individual document within the search results, we also estimate the signi cant diagnoses, tests and treatments in that document according to IDF and display those to the user. As the underlying retrieval model, we adopted the default Elasticsearch BM25 model."",null,null",null,null

54,"53,""While research on how clinicians search indicates that they pose queries according to three mains tasks (diagnoses, tests and treatment) [2], most systems for searching EBM resources do not take these tasks into account. However, structuring IR systems around di erent categories of information is a common approach in IR -- generally referred to as faceted retrieval [3]. Faceted retrieval reduces mental workload by promoting recognition over recall and by suggesting logical yet unexpected navigation paths to the user [16]. Meaningful facets have been found to support learning, re ection, discovery and information nding [8, 12, 16]. EBM-based search can be viewed as a complex search task [7]: clinicians have complex information needs and are o en time pressured. us, an IR approach such as faceted retrieval, which reduces mental overhead, is desirable. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that"",null,null",null,null

56,"55,""faceted retrieval, which has shown bene ts in general web search, can improve search for EBM (Section 3.2)."",null,null",null,null
57,"56,""e importance of access to biomedical literature has resulted in many biomedical-speci c retrieval systems [4]. While some systems mention di erent types of clinical queries (e.g., therapy, diagnosis, harm and prognosis) they typically did not integrate these into the retrieval method or in the way the searcher was presented with or interacted with the search results. Our system uses the clinical tasks as the bases for both retrieval and interaction. Finally, most methods for searching EBM resources were for research purposes, rather than clinical decision support. As such, recall was an important factor (i.e., nding all the relevant articles for a particular information need). In contrast, for clinical decision support, precision can be more important (i.e., nding the article that helps with the clinical task without reading many irrelevant articles). Our system bases the design of the IR system around improving precision via task-based ltering."",null,null",null,null
58,"57,""Some IR systems use diagnosis, test and treatment information as features in a retrieval model. A common approach here is to map all queries and documents being searched to medical concepts according to an external domain-knowledge resource; matching is then done at the concept level, comparing a query concept with a document concept [9, 10, 14]. Although concept retrieval using tasks has proved e ective, the tasks were simply used as features within the retrieval model and never exposed to the clinician [9, 10]. In this study, we a empt to make the task-based information explicit in the way the clinician interacts with the system, as well as the basis for the underlying retrieval model."",null,null",null,null
