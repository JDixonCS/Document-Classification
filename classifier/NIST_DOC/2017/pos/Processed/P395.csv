9,"8,""A search engine that can return the ideal results for a person's information need, independent of the speci c query that is used to express that need, would be preferable to one that is overly swayed by the individual terms used; search engines should be consistent in the presence of syntactic query variations responding to the same information need. In this paper we examine the retrieval consistency of a set of ve systems responding to syntactic query variations over one hundred topics, working with the UQV100 test collection, and using Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) relative to a centroid ranking over the query variations per topic as a measure of consistency. We also introduce a new data fusion algorithm, Rank-Biased Centroid (RBC), for constructing a centroid ranking over a set of rankings from query variations for a topic. RBC is compared with alternative data fusion algorithms."",null,null",null,null

Alternative methods for determining relevance include user studies, online interleaving, and A/B testing. What is important to note is that retrieval e ectiveness encompasses more than just relevance."",null,null",null,null
24,"23,""Batch evaluation has typically used only a single query per topic, although a number of researchers working on early test collections advocated and explored the e ect of using multiple queries per topic (see work by Spa¨rck Jones and van Rijsbergen [35], Belkin et al. [5] and Buckley and Walz [7] among others). Recent work by Bailey et al. [3] and Koopman and Zuccon [22] has returned to this theme, resulting in new test collections with large numbers of query variations responding to each topic's information need."",null,null",null,null
25,"24,""e availability of such test collections allows us to consider a new dimension in assessing the retrieval e ectiveness of search engines ­ namely, how consistent they are when returning results in response to query variations that address the same information need. e importance of consistency can be understood when we consider simple examples like mis-spellings. For example """"facebook"""", """"facebok"""", and """"faecbook"""" pre y clearly all want to nd the Facebook home page. Consistency also applies to more complex examples involving synonyms (for example, """"health bene ts of vitamin c"""" and """"health bene ts of ascorbic acid"""") or entirely rephrased needs (for example, """"how much does a raspberry pi cost"""" and """"price of raspberry pi computer""""). In each of these cases, we can contemplate that there exists an ideal ranked set of relevant results drawn from the corpus. Test collections are premised on this principle, where the ideal set for a topic is discovered through judging a document pool formed from di erent rankings. An ideal search engine would return (only) this set of results given a query for a topic, and the di erence in relevance from what is actually returned and this ideal ranking is captured by a relevance measure. Equally, given a set of syntactic query variations, an ideal search engine would return this ideal ranking of results, independent of the query variation."",null,null",null,null
26,"25,""Indeed, much research in information retrieval seeks to tackle exactly this problem of nding an ideal set of results without relying solely on the original query's syntactic expression. For instance, query re-writing techniques such as spelling correction [11], term stemming [24], query expansion [33], and query substitutions [19] are used to manipulate the user-entered query and thereby extract a be er set of documents from the index. Stemming and stopword removal [23, 25] may also be used in indexing processes or within the matching algorithms at query execution time."",null,null",null,null

32,"31,""People use many di erent expressions to describe the same information need (see, for example, Furnas et al. [15]).

33,"32,""We propose that the consistency in rankings of a system when faced with many di erent query variations for a single topic can be one such measure. e Rank-Biased Overlap measure developed by Webber et al.

Due to the scale of variations within UQV100 (19­101 unique query variations per topic, for 100 topics), each individual topic has a similar number of queries as might be found in an entire query-only processed test collection like the TREC 2014 Web track [10]."",null,null",null,null

44,"43,2.1 Data fusion,null,null",null,null
45,"44,""Data fusion ­ combining evidence from di erent sources ­ is a widely-studied problem. In IR fusion is typically applied when evidence from multiple ranked answer lists needs to be combined into a single ranked list, for example in meta-search, where results from multiple independent search systems are combined into a single ranking [1], and in multi-lingual retrieval, where results from searches across collections in di erent languages are combined into a single answer list [16]."",null,null",null,null
46,"45,""Data fusion approaches can be broadly grouped into those that use the ranker's score (that is, the value assigned by a ranking function) of each document in a results list, and those that make use only of the rank position of each document in the answer list. Perhaps the most well-known approaches in the former category are by Fox and Shaw [13], including CombMAX, where the nal score of a document is the maximum of the ranker scores that it received in any input ranked list; CombSUM, where the nal document score is the total of the ranker's scores that it received in the input lists; and CombMNZ, where the nal document score is calculated as in CombSUM but further multiplied by the number of input lists in which the document appears, thereby promoting those documents that were retrieved in multiple lists. e document ranker scores in the input ranked lists may also be normalized in di erent ways, including linear re-scaling into a chosen range [39], or by controlling an upper bound based on the sum or variance of the input scores [28]."",null,null",null,null
47,"46,""For fusion based only on rank information, techniques from social choice theory such as the Borda count and Condorcet criterion have been applied. In the Borda count [1], each candidate (document) receives a score determined by how many other candidates were ranked lower, with these scores summed across all ballots (input lists). e Condorcet criterion instead determines an outcome based on which candidate achieves the highest number of wins based on pairwise comparisons with all other candidates [12, 29]"",null,null",null,null

Subsequent work using the TREC-2 collection further demonstrated that good methods for fusing the results of multiple queries can lead to results that are be er than those of the best single query [6].

52,"51,""In IR, as in many other domains, it can be important to compare the similarity, or consistency, of groups of things. ese groups may be conjoint (consisting of the same items) or disjoint (one group may include items that do not occur in the other group), and may be setbased (where there is no known or inferred ordering of the items) or ordered (where the sequence in which the items occur ma ers). Typical examples where one might wish to compare groups include measuring the similarity of the answer lists returned by two search engines in response to the same query; or the similarity of the e ectiveness ranking of a set of several di erent retrieval systems, when evaluated over two di erent test collections. A wide range of list similarity measures have been proposed and applied."",null,null",null,null

56,"55,""One of the similarity measures most commonly used in IR is Kendall's  , a rank correlation coe cient that calculates the normalized number of concordant pairs (items that are ordered the same in two rankings) minus discordant pairs (items that are ordered di erently in the two rankings), resulting in a score between 1 (perfect agreement between the two rankings) and -1 (perfect disagreement) [9]. Kendall's  is a measure that assumes conjoint ranked lists, that is, the lists are permutations of the same set of items; it is also an unweighted measure, where each pair contributes equally to the outcome, wherever it occurs in the ranking. However, when comparing ranked answer lists, items that are higher in the ranking are more important (users pay more a ention to top-ranked results); similarly, when comparing rankings of system e ectiveness scores, di erences between the top systems are generally of greater interest than di erences between systems that perform less well. TauAP [41] addresses a number of these weaknesses, while Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) [38] addresses even more. RBO is a generalized measure of similarity between rankings based on a probabilistic user model, and readily handles non-conjoint lists. It applies a geometric sequence of weights to items in the lists; with the emphasis of the weighting adjustable via a user persistence parameter , which also determines the probability that the user will reach a certain rank. Inspired by RBO, Tan and Clarke [36] de ne a family of Maximized E ectiveness Di erence (MED) measures, each based on an IR e ectiveness metric (and hence a di erent underlying user model)."",null,null",null,null

221,"220,""Test collection-based evaluation reduces many sources of variance that occur in information seeking in the wild to a level that is tractable from the standpoint of statistical analysis. Our de nition of consistency is predicated on having test collections that embody some plausible set of query variations per information need. We do not claim that it can address all possible sources of, or needs for, desirable consistency (or inconsistency) in information seeking."",null,null",null,null
222,"221,""Our de nition of consistency might be brought into question by queries that exhibit extrinsic diversity [31] or intrinsic diversity [32] or searching as learning [14]. Extrinsic diversity occurs when a query has many di erent information needs that might be associated with it, while intrinsic diversity addresses cases where there are multiple sub-tasks associated in satisfying the information need. Searching as learning involves evolving query expression throughout a session. For cases involving extrinsic diversity, test collections without query variations typically declare one information need and judge relevance with respect to that information need; other plausible information needs are ignored. From the standpoint of assessing consistency, our approach is the same and has the same aw of ignoring other information needs. For cases involving intrinsic diversity and searching as learning, approaches have been developed that target aspects of such complex evaluation situations, including TREC's Web track's Diversity task [10] and"",null,null",null,null
223,"222,""the Session [20] and Tasks [42] tracks. For assessing just consistency, we suggest that test collections should involve more narrow information needs, with an emphasis on developing speci c unambiguous topic statements. Despite this, we believe that consistency is also important for systems that are able to accurately detect and respond to intrinsic diversity queries, and just as with narrower information needs, there will be a wide range of query variations for an information need that is intrinsically diverse."",null,null",null,null
224,"223,""One more question the reader might have is why measure consistency at all, and why not just go straight to average relevance. Two issues arise: rst, relevance judgments are a substantially more expensive resource to accumulate, particularly when dealing with test collections with thousands of query variations. Second, although two rankings may have identical relevance scores, they may be completely di erent. Consider an information need such as """"You are worried about the prevalence of fake news, and decide to nd authoritative newspapers to read instead, just like people did last century."""" Now consider two rankings in response to two query variations, one of which lists [theguardian.com, zeit.de, .com, washingtonpost.com] and one of which lists [wsj.com, lemonde.fr, nytimes.com, theglobeandmail.com].

RQ-C1 asks whether topics vary in consistency, and to do this we plot the average and standard deviation of Cti against all 100 topics of UQV100, sorted by increasing Cti . We characterize this in two ways: Figure 2 shows the results for System 1 (where standard deviation is of the RBO scores per variation for the topic), while Figure 3 shows the results when aggregating over the Cti scores obtained from the ve systems. Even with the large standard deviations that can be observed in both plots (while being clearly smaller in the second), we can conclude that di erent topics have di erent consistency. For persistence  ,"""" 0.9, approximately 25% of topics have consistency under 0.25, while around 12% have consistency greater than 0.5.

In RQC3, we examine the relationship between collection consistency CT and the ve systems which contributed to UQV100. In Figure 4 we report on the consistency scores for each system, using boxplots to show the spread of values. From this we can observe that Systems 1 and 5 are very similar to each other (CT 0.32); Systems 2 and 3 are very similar to each other and more consistent (CT 0.40), and System 4 is di erent and yet more consistent (CT ,"""" 0.44). Using a two-tailed paired Student's t-test, we also assessed each pair of systems; Table 6 con rms our observations."""""",null,null",null,null
318,"317,""Another way of understanding the relationship between consistency and systems is to treat each topic as an """"assessor"""" and each system as the """"subject"""" being assessed with regards to its degree of consistency. Since topics in UQV100 contain a similar number of query variations (average of 55 per topic) as many existing test collections have queries, and past practice has been to examine rank order correlation of systems by comparing sets of systems across two or more collections, we will adopt a similar method here. We assess how similar the relative ordering of systems is using one-way Intraclass Correlation [4], Kendall's Coe cient of Concordance [21] (commonly wri en as Kendall's W ), and Krippendor 's  [17]. All of these measures address inter-assessor agreement, for three or more assessors, and can accommodate ordinal data (and for ICC and , interval or ratio data). In Table 7, we report the results for these measures of rank agreement, where the score is the topic consistency Cti . We use these measures rather than pair-wise comparisons of topics using Kendall's  , since we have 100 topic """"assessors"""" involved, and the measures allow us to consider multiple """"assessors"""" with a single test statistic, while Kendall's  only supports two """"assessors"""". Due to the di erences between ICC and Kendall's W , it is expected that ICC scores may be lower than Kendall's W scores over the same data, since it considers not just relative rank order but also the magnitude of di erences, as discussed by Sheskin [34]. In all three measures, 1 indicates perfect agreement among the assessors, and 0 indicates no agreement beyond what would be expected by chance. Both ICC and  can report small negative values, which also signify no agreement."",null,null",null,null
