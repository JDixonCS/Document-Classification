15,"14,""is paper proposes K-NRM, a kernel based neural model for document ranking. Given a query and a set of documents, K-NRM uses a translation matrix that models word-level similarities via word embeddings, a new kernel-pooling technique that uses kernels to extract multi-level so match features, and a learning-to-rank layer that combines those features into the nal ranking score."",null,null",null,null
16,"15,""e whole model is trained end-to-end. e ranking layer learns desired feature pa erns from the pairwise ranking loss. e kernels transfer the feature pa erns into so -match targets at each similarity level and enforce them on the translation matrix. e word embeddings are tuned accordingly so that they can produce the desired so matches. Experiments on a commercial search engine's query log demonstrate the improvements of K-NRM over prior feature-based and neural-based states-of-the-art, and explain the source of K-NRM's advantage: Its kernel-guided embedding encodes a similarity metric tailored for matching query words to document words, and provides e ective multi-level so matches."",null,null",null,null

20,"19,""In traditional information retrieval, queries and documents are typically represented by discrete bags-of-words, the ranking is based on exact matches between query and document words, and trained ranking models rely heavily on feature engineering. In comparison, newer neural information retrieval (neural IR) methods use continuous text embeddings, model the query-document relevance via so matches, and aim to learn feature representations automatically. With the successes of deep learning in many related areas, neural IR has the potential to rede ne the boundaries of information retrieval; however, achieving that potential has been di cult so far."",null,null",null,null

23,"22,""Many neural approaches use distributed representations (e.g., word2vec [17]), but in spite of many e orts, distributed representations have a limited history of success for document ranking. Exact match of query words to document words is a strong signal of relevance [8], whereas so -match is a weaker signal that must be used carefully. Word2vec may consider `pi sburgh' to be similar to `boston', and `hotel' to be similar to `motel'. However, a person searching for `pi sburgh hotel' may accept a document about `pi sburgh motel', but probably will reject a document about `boston hotel'. How to use these so -match signals e ectively and reliably is an open problem."",null,null",null,null
24,"23,""is work addresses these challenges with a kernel based neural ranking model (K-NRM). K-NRM uses distributed representations to represent query and document words. eir similarities are used to construct a translation model. Word pair similarities are combined by a new kernel-pooling layer that uses kernels to so ly count the frequencies of word pairs at di erent similarity levels (so TF). e so -TF signals are used as features in a ranking layer, which produces the nal ranking score. All of these layers are di erentiable and allow K-NRM to be optimized end-to-end."",null,null",null,null
25,"24,""e kernels are the key to K-NRM's capability. During learning, the kernels convert the learning-to-rank loss to requirements on so -TF pa erns, and adjust the word embeddings to produce a so match that can be er separate the relevant and irrelevant documents. is kernel-guided embedding learning encodes a similarity metric tailored for matching query and document. e tailored similarity metric is conveyed by the learned embeddings, which produces e ective multi-level so -matches for ad-hoc ranking."",null,null",null,null
26,"25,""Extensive experiments on a commercial search engine's query log demonstrate the signi cant and robust advantage of K-NRM. On di erent evaluation scenarios (in-domain, cross-domain and raw user clicks), and on di erent parts of the query log (head, torso, and tail), K-NRM outperforms both feature-based ranking and neural ranking states-of-the-art by as much as 65%. K-NRM's advantage is not from an unexplainable `deep learning magic', but the long-desired so match achieved by its kernel-guided embedding learning. In our analysis, if used without the multi-level so match or the embedding learning, the advantage of K-NRM quickly diminishes; while with the kernel-guided embedding learning, K-NRM successfully learns relevance-focused so matches using its embedding and ranking layers, and the memorized ranking preferences generalize well to di erent testing scenarios."",null,null",null,null

32,"31,""Retrieval models such as query likelihood and BM25 are based on exact matching of query and document words, which limits the information available to the ranking model and may lead to problems such vocabulary mismatch [4]. Statistical translation models were an a empt to overcome this limitation. ey model query-document relevance using a pre-computed translation matrix that describes the similarities between word pairs [1]. At query time, the ranking function considers the similarities of all query and document word pairs, allowing query words to be so -matched to document words."",null,null",null,null
33,"32,e translation matrix can be calculated via mutual information in a corpus [12] or using user clicks [6].,null,null",null,null
34,"33,""Word pair interactions have also been modeled by word embeddings. Word embeddings trained from surrounding contexts, for example, word2vec [17], are considered to be the factorization of word pairs' PMI matrix [14]. Compared to word pair similarities which are hard to learn, word embeddings provide a smooth low-level approximation of word similarities that may improve translation models [8, 24]."",null,null",null,null
35,"34,""Some research has questioned whether word embeddings based on surrounding context, such as word2vec, are suitable for ad hoc ranking. Instead, it customizes word embeddings for search tasks. Nalisnick et al. propose to match query and documents using both the input and output of the embedding model, instead of only using one side of them [19]. Diaz et al. nd that word embeddings trained locally on pseudo relevance feedback documents are more related to the query's information needs, and can provide be er query expansion terms [5]."",null,null",null,null
36,"35,""Current neural ranking models fall into two groups: representation based and interaction based [8]. e earlier focus of neural IR was mainly on representation based models, in which the query and documents are rst embedded into continuous vectors, and the ranking is calculated from their embeddings' similarity. For example, DSSM [11] and its convolutional version CDSSM [22] map words to le er-tri-grams, embed query and documents using neural networks built upon the le er-tri-grams, and rank documents using their embedding similarity with the query."",null,null",null,null
37,"36,""e interaction based neural models, on the other hand, learn query-document matching pa erns from word-level interactions. For example, ARC-II [10] and MatchPyramid [20] build hierarchical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on the interactions of two texts' word embeddings; they are e ective in matching tweetretweet and question-answers [10]. e Deep Relevance Matching Model (DRMM) uses pyramid pooling (histogram) [7] to summarize the word-level similarities into ranking signals [9]. e word level similarities are calculated from pre-trained word2vec embeddings, and the histogram counts the number of word pairs at di erent similarity levels. e counts are combined by a feed forward network to produce nal ranking scores. Interaction based models and representation based models address the ranking task from di erent perspectives, and can be combined for further improvements [18]."",null,null",null,null
38,"37,""is work builds upon the ideas of customizing word embeddings and the interaction based neural models: K-NRM ranks documents using so matches from query-document word interactions, and learns to encode the relevance preferences using customized word embeddings at the same time, which is achieved by the kernels."",null,null",null,null

537,"536,""is paper presents K-NRM, a kernel based neural ranking model for ad-hoc search. e model captures word-level interactions using word embeddings, and ranks documents using a learningto-rank layer. e center of the model is the new kernel-pooling technique. It uses kernels to so ly count word matches at di erent similarity levels and provide so -TF ranking features. e kernels are di erentiable and support end-to-end learning. Supervised by ranking labels, the learning of word embeddings is guided by the kernels with the goal of providing so -match signals that be er separate relevant documents from irrelevant ones. e learned embeddings encode the relevance preferences and provide e ective multi-level so matches for ad-hoc ranking."",null,null",null,null
538,"537,""Our experiments on a commercial search engine's query log demonstrated K-NRM's advantages. On three testing scenarios (indomain, cross-domain, and raw user clicks), K-NRM outperforms both feature based ranking baselines and neural ranking baselines by as much as 65%, and is extremely e ective at the top ranking positions. e improvements are also robust: Stable gains are observed on head and tail queries, with fewer training data, a wide range of kernel widths, and a simple ranking layer."",null,null",null,null
539,"538,""Our analysis revealed that K-NRM's advantage is not from `deep learning magic' but the long-desired so match between query and documents, which is achieved by the kernel-guided embedding learning. Without it, K-NRM's advantage quickly diminishes: its variants with only exact match, pre-trained word2vec, or uni-level embedding training all perform signi cantly worse, and sometimes fail to outperform the simple feature based baselines."",null,null",null,null
540,"539,""Further analysis of the learned embeddings illustrated how K-NRM tailors them for ad-hoc ranking: More than 90% of word pairs that are mapped together in word2vec are decoupled, satisfying the stricter de nition of so match required in ad-hoc search. Word pairs that are less correlated in documents but convey frequent search tasks are discovered and mapped to certain similarity levels."",null,null",null,null

542,"541,""Our experiments and analysis not only demonstrated the effectiveness of K-NRM, but also provide useful intuitions about the advantages of neural methods and how they can be tailored for IR tasks.
