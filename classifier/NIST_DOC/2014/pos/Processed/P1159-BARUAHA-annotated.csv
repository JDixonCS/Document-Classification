13,ABSTRACT,null,null
,,,
14,"We examine the effects of expanding a judged set of sentences with their duplicates from a corpus. Including new sentences that are exact duplicates of the previously judged sentences may allow for better estimation of performance metrics and enhance the reusability of a test collection. We perform experiments in context of the Temporal Summarization Track at TREC 2013. We find that adding duplicate sentences to the judged set does not significantly affect relative system performance. However, we do find statistically significant changes in the performance of nearly half the systems that participated in the Track. We recommend adding exact duplicate sentences to the set of relevance judgements in order to obtain a more accurate estimate of system performance.",null,null

17,1. INTRODUCTION,null,null
,,,
18,"The Temporal Summarization Track (TST) at TREC 2013 [2], required returning information relevant to topics, from a web-scale time-ordered document stream (the TREC KBA 2013 Stream Corpus [1]). The Sequential Update Summarization (SUS) task in the TST, called for participating systems (runs), to return updates (sentences) about events (topics), with the goal that new updates should contain information that is new to the user.",Y,null
,,,
19,"For the SUS task, the Stream corpus is effectively a collection of documents (along with their timestamps), spanning the time period between October 2011 to January 2013, with an average of 93,037 documents per hour. Each participating system was tasked to return updates from a duration spanning 240 hours for each topic. In all, the TST received 28 runs from the participants of the SUS task. The number of updates returned in the runs varied from 110 to 2,815,808.",null,null

21,"For evaluation of runs, the pool of updates judged by track assessors contains 9,113 sentences for 9 task topics.",null,null
,,,
22,"We found that there are a very large number of duplicate sentences in the corpus. Indeed, the track organizers found duplicates amongst the sentences sampled from runs, while constructing the pool for assessment. Accordingly, they created an evaluation framework designed to accommodate for duplicates within the judged set of sentences. In effect, the identifier of a duplicate sentence (within the judged set of sentences) is mapped to the identifier of the designated original sentence (prototype). However, the duplicates of judged sentences from the corpus, were not mapped to the prototypes. The track's evaluation is also designed to omit sentences that are not in the judged set. Such omission is consistent with similar approaches [7, 3], and works very well for evaluating relative system performance (Section 3.1).",null,null

23,"Including exact duplicates of judged sentences from the corpus may have ramifications for a system's evaluation as well as for the re-usability of the TST test collection. For example, if sentence s is an exact duplicate of a sentence p in the judged set, a system would neither be rewarded nor penalized for returning s, since s is not in the judged set of sentences. This may lead to an unfair evaluation for the system.",null,null

28,2. OBSERVATIONS ON DUPLICATES,null,null
,,,
29,We briefly describe the original set of judged sentences of the SUS task and set a context for subsequent sections.,null,null
,,,
30,2.1 Original Judged Sentences,null,null
,,,
31,"Each topic in the SUS task corresponds to an event (of type earthquake, storm, accident, bombing or shooting) that",null,null
,,,
32,1159,null,null
,,,
33,"occurred within the corpus duration. The query for the topic included query terms, and query start and end times. The query was considered active for the time interval between query start and end times (the query duration, typically 240 hours).",null,null
,,,
34,"The assessors initially identified a set of nuggets (short snippets of text containing information relevant to the topic), from the edit history of the Wikipedia1 article for an event. A pool of sentences for evaluation was created by sampling 60 updates per topic per submitted run with highest confidence scores (a confidence score was required for each update in a run). Some close duplicates were identified from this initial sample which allowed more updates to be included in the pool [2]. This created a pool of sentences totalling 9,113 for 9 topics. A pooled sentence was matched against nuggets and was considered relevant if it contained a nugget.",null,null
,,,
35,2.2 Expanded Set of Judged Sentences,null,null
,,,
36,"Given the original set of judged sentences, for each topic, for each sentence in the judged set, we found the exact duplicates within the query duration of the topic, from the Stream corpus. For each duplicate found, we added it to the original judged set and mapped its identifier to the identifier of its prototype. Table 1 lists the number of judged sentences, the number of duplicates known to exist within the original judged set, the number of sentences for which the duplicates were found within the query duration. Also shown are the number of relevant sentences in the original judged set for each topic, and the number of relevant sentences for which duplicates were found in the query duration from the corpus.",null,null
,,,
37,"We see that the original judged set expands nearly a 1000 times from 9,113 to 9,034,179, when duplicates are added. However, the number of relevant duplicates found is extremely less at 97,256 (about 10 times the size of the original set). Table 2 shows the top occurring duplicate sentences. In fact, the top 3 most occurring duplicate sentences account for 67% of the total duplicates found. We observed that most of the duplicates that occur with high frequency are duplicates of non relevant sentences. They appear to be boilerplate sentences found in web-site navigation menus or at the end of news articles. In contrast the most frequent relevant duplicate, ""National Hurricane Center in Miami said Isaac became a Category 1 hurricane Tuesday with winds of 75 mph."", was found to occur just 5,403 times, in the query duration for topic 5 (""Hurricane Isaac"").",null,null
,,,
38,"We feel that the high number of duplicates found overall could be because of news/web syndication services. News wire documents form the second largest component of documents in the Stream corpus [1], with social documents (blogs and forums) forming the bulk of the corpus, and documents sourced from links submitted to bitly.com forming the remainder. One would expect a high number of news/web articles to be generated after the occurrence of a catastrophic event.",null,null

39,3. EFFECT OF ADDING DUPLICATES TO THE ORIGINAL SET OF JUDGEMENTS,null,null
,,,
40,The TST introduces new measures to evaluate temporal summarization. The measures are analogous to precision/gain and recall and they are also designed to account,null,null
,,,
41,1http://www.wikipedia.org/,null,null
,,,
42,"for latency and verbosity of updates (sentences). Participant systems are tasked to return a timestamp along with each update about an event. Latency discounts are applied to sentences that are returned later than the first known occurrence of the nugget of information that they contain. The nuggets were identified, and their time of first occurrence noted, by the track's assessors, using the edit histories of the Wikipedia articles for the topics (Section 2.1). Verbosity discounts are applied based on the length of the returned sentences. Longer sentences are penalized more than shorter sentences by the verbosity discount, which essentially forms an aspect of ""user friendliness"" for a system.",Y,null
,,,
43,"The track introduces two precision-like measures, Expected Latency Gain (E[LG]) and Expected Gain (E[G]), as well as two recall-like measures, Latency Comprehensiveness (LC) and Comprehensiveness (C). The E[LG] and E[G] measures use the relevance score (0/1 for binary relevance) as a measure of gain and potentially discount the gain for updatelatency. The C and LC measures attempt to capture how well a system performed at returning all identified nuggets and how quickly it emitted updates containing these nuggets from the canonical time of first occurrence for the nuggets.",null,null
,,,
44,"The track coordinators consider E[LG] and LC to be the official metrics of the track and we report our analyses for these metrics only. Detailed descriptions of all metrics can be found in the 2013 Temporal Summarization Track Overiew [2]. We note here that in the track's evaluation framework, a system returning sentences not present in the judged set of sentences is neither penalized nor rewarded. On the other hand, returning duplicate sentences present in the judged set will result in the verbosity discount being applied for each.",null,null
,,,
45,3.1 Effect on Systems' Ranking,null,null
,,,
46,"Table 3 provides Kendall's  correlation between the rankings given by the original judged and expanded set for each of the four task measures. We can see that the correlation tends to be high indicating that relative performance is typically maintained regardless of assessment pool. This is consistent with other works conducting similar research [7, 10, 11, 3, 9]. Accordingly, we can see that not including all exact duplicates in the judged sentences was a reasonable and effective method of relative system performance evaluation. However, there may still be benefit to expanding the judged set because there are changes to the absolute performance scores of the systems (Section 3.2) which may be indicative of a change in the user experience.",null,null
,,,
47,3.2 Effect on System Performance,null,null
,,,
48,"Overall, 13 submitted runs showed a statistically significant change in E[LG] and 12 submitted runs showed a statistically significant change in LC, for a paired t-test with p-value  0.05. The average difference across topics (and standard deviation) between the original judged set and the expanded set are presented in Tables 4 and 5 for E[LG] and LC, respectively. Runs for which there was no difference in score are not listed in the tables. Runs are listed in sorted order based upon the run names.",null,null
,,,
49,"There exist several runs with no E[LG] change which is primarily due to the fact that they do not contain any newly identified duplicates and so would not be penalized for them. The majority of the the other runs, do experience a general decrease in the performance with respect to the expanded",null,null

Of particular note is run 8 in Table 4, which has a general increase in performance indicating that run 8 did return relevant sentences which were not in the original judged set, but were duplicates of relevant sentences from the original set.

While beneficial for evaluating system performance for finding relevant sentences, ignoring unjudged sentences does not accurately reflect the user experience.

178,"As an immediate future work, we plan to investigate the effect of including unjudged updates for verbosity discounts. Accounting for unjudged sentences in runs may not be a straightforward task due to the potential quantity of them. A simple but potentially inefficient mechanism would be to store information (e.g. length, timestamp, duplicates) about every sentence in the corpus which would facilitate applying the necessary discount. Alternatively, it may be possible to produce an estimate of unjudged sentence lengths. This may require the use of some form of sampling and the use of inclusion probabilities (e.g. [5]). Determining a reasonable method for applying verbosity penalization to unjudged sentences is an area of research that we intend to pursue.",null,null

179,"The TST at TREC 2013 had only 9 topics.

With more topics from the TREC 2014 version of the track, we expect to get a more accurate estimate of changes in performance when evaluating with a large number of duplicates. Expansion of relevance judgements with exact duplicates is simple and not only does it help produce more accurate performance scores but also potentially aids in reusability of the test collection for the development of new temporal summarization systems.",Y,null
