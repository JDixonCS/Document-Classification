11,"A popular strategy for search result diversification is to first retrieve a set of documents utilizing a standard retrieval method and then rerank the results. We adopt a different perspective on the problem, based on data fusion. Starting from the hypothesis that data fusion can improve performance in terms of diversity metrics, we examine the impact of standard data fusion methods on result diversification. We take the output of a set of rankers, optimized for diversity or not, and find that data fusion can significantly improve state-of-the art diversification methods. We also introduce a new data fusion method, called diversified data fusion, which infers latent topics of a query using topic modeling, without leveraging outside information. Our experiments show that data fusion methods can enhance the performance of diversification and DDF significantly outperforms existing data fusion methods in terms of diversity metrics.",null,null

16,1. INTRODUCTION,null,null

17,"Search result diversification is widely being studied as a way of tackling query ambiguity. Instead of trying to identify the ""correct"" interpretation behind a query, the idea is to make the search results diversified so that users with different backgrounds will find at least one of these results to be relevant to their information need [2]. In contrast to the traditional assumption of independent document relevance, search result diversification approaches typically consider the relevance of a document in light of other retrieved documents [40]. Diversification models try to identify the probable ""aspects"" of the query and return documents for each aspect, thereby making the result list more diverse.",null,null

18,"Data fusion approaches, also called rank aggregation approaches, consist in combining result lists in order to produce a new and hopefully better ranking [16, 42]. Here, results lists can be produced by",null,null

20,"a wide range of ranking approaches, based, e.g., on different query or document representations. Data fusion methods can improve retrieval performance in terms of traditional relevance-oriented metrics like MAP and precision@k over the methods used to generate the individual result lists being fused [17, 26, 27, 49]. One reason is that retrieval approaches often return very different non-relevant documents, but many of the same relevant documents [49].",null,null
,,,
21,"We examine the hypothesis that data fusion can improve performance in terms of diversity metrics by promoting aspects that are found in disparate ranked lists to the top of the fused list. Our first step in testing this hypothesis is to examine the impact of existing data fusion methods in terms of diversity scores when fusing ranked lists. We find that they tend to improve over individual component runs on nearly all of the diversity metrics that we consider: Prec-IA, MAP-IA, -NDCG, ERR-IA (all at rank 20).",null,null
,,,
22,"Building on these findings we propose a new data fusion method, called diversified data fusion (DDF). Based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), it operates on documents in the result lists to be fused, whether the result lists have been diversified or not. DDF infers latent topics, their probabilities of being relevant and a multinomial distribution of topics over the documents being fused. Thus, it integrates topic structure and rank information. DDF does not assume the explicit availability of query aspects, but infers these as well as the latent prior for a given query via the documents being fused. Experimental results show that DDF can aggregate result lists--whether produced by diversification or ad hoc retrieval models--and boost the diversity of the final fused list, outperforming state-of-the-art diversification methods and established data fusion methods, especially in terms of intent-aware precision metrics.",null,null

31,2.1 Search result diversification,null,null
,,,
32,"Search result diversification is similar to ad hoc search, but differs in its judging criteria and evaluation measures [8, 12]. The basic premise in search result diversification is that the relevance of a set of documents depends not only on the individual relevance of its members, but also on how they relate to one another [2]. Ideally, users can find at least one relevant document to the underlying information need. Most previous work on search result diversification can be classified as either implicit or explicit [39, 41].",null,null
,,,
33,"Implicit approaches to result diversification promote diversity by selecting a document that differs from the documents appearing before it in terms of vocabulary, as captured by a notion of document similarity, such as cosine similarity or Kullback-Leibler divergence. Carbonell and Goldstein [6] propose the maximal marginal relevance (MMR) method, which reduces redundancy while maintaining query relevance when selecting a document. Chen and Karger [7] describe a retrieval method incorporating negative feedback in which documents are assumed to be non-relevant once they are included in the result list, with the goal of maximizing diversity. Zhai et al. [51] present a subtopic retrieval model where the utility of a document in a ranking is dependent on other documents in the ranking and documents that cover many different subtopics of a query topic are found. Other implicit work includes, e.g., [1] where set-based recommendation of diverse articles is proposed. We also tackle the problem of search result diversification implicitly, but in a different way, i.e., by data fusion.",null,null
,,,
34,"Explicit approaches to diversification assume that a set of query aspects is available and return documents for each of them. Past work has shown that explicit approaches are usually somewhat superior to implicit diversification techniques. Well-known examples include xQuAD [39], RxQuAD [45], IA-select [2], PM-2 [13], and, more recently, DSPApprox [14]. Instead of modeling a set of aspects implicitly, these algorithms obtain the set of aspects either manually, e.g., from aspect descriptions [8, 12], or they create them directly from, e.g., suggested queries generated by commercial search engines [13, 39] or predefined aspect categories [44]. We propose an implicit fusion-based diversification model where we do not assume that the aspects of the query are available but do assume that we can infer the underlying topics and the prior relevance of each topic for search result diversification.",null,null
,,,
35,2.2 Data fusion,null,null
,,,
36,"A core concern in data fusion is how to assign a score to a document that appears in one of the lists to be fused [17, 19, 42, 49]. Most previous work on data fusion focuses on optimizing a traditional evaluation metric, like MAP, p@k and nDCG. Fusion approaches can be categorized into supervised or unsupervised: Supervised data fusion approaches, like -Merge [43], first extract a number of features, either from documents or lists, and then utilize a machine learning algorithm to train the fusion model [15, 17, 49].",null,null
,,,
37,"In contrast, unsupervised data fusion methods mainly use either retrieval scores or ranks of documents in the lists to be merged, with the CombSUM family of fusion methods being the oldest and one of the most successful ones in many information retrieval tasks [26, 42]. State-of-the-art data fusion methods ClustFuseCombSUM and ClustFuseCombMNZ (both cluster-based methods) are proposed in [23]. Methods utilizing retrieval scores take score information from the lists to be fused as input, while those utilizing rank information only use order information of the documents appearing in the lists to be fused as input. Data fusion methods utilizing rank information have many uses and applications in information retrieval, including, e.g., expert search [30, 35], query reformulations [43], meta-search [4, 17] and microblog search [31, 32].",null,null
,,,
38,We do not make the assumption that labeled data is available but integrate standard unsupervised data fusion information into our diversified fusion model for search result diversification via a latent topic model.,null,null
,,,
39,2.3 Topic modeling,null,null
,,,
40,"Topic models have been proposed for reducing the high dimensionality of words appearing in documents into low-dimensional ""latent topics."" From the first work on topic models [21], the Probablistic LSI model, topic models have received significant attention [5, 18, 22] and have proved to be effective in many information retrieval tasks [24, 47, 50]. Latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) [5] represents each document as a finite mixture over ""latent"" topics where each topic is represented as a finite mixture over words existing in that document. Based on LDA, many extensions have been proposed, e.g., to handle users' connections with particular documents and topics [37], to learn relations among different topics [25, 29], for topic over time [46], for dynamic mixture model [48], or tweet summarization [36]. LDA has also been extended to sentiment analysis [28]. We propose a novel topic model where fusion scores of each document appearing in lists to be fused are used to boost the performance of state-of-the-art diversification methods.",null,null
,,,
41,"Our work adds the following to the work discussed above. We propose a fusion-based approach to the search result diversification task. We find that existing unsupervised fusion methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art diversification methods. In addition, we propose a novel fusion method, diversified data fusion, that uses the output of a fusion step and a topic modeling step as input to a diversification step. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to utilize data fusion for diversification.",null,null

45,"We summarize the main notation used in this paper in Table 1. In the remainder, we distinguish between queries, aspects and topics. A query is an expression of an information need; in our experimental evaluation below, queries are provided as part of a TREC test collection. An aspect (sometimes called subtopic at the TREC Web track) is an interpretation of an information need. We use topic to refer to latent topics as identified by a topic modeling method, in our case LDA. A component list is a ranked list that serves as input for a data fusion method. A fused list is a list that is the result of applying a fusion method to component lists.",null,null

138,"DDF consists of three main parts: (I) perform standard data fusion; (II) infer latent topics; (III) perform diversification; see Algorithm 1. In the first part (""Part I"" in Algorithm 1), DDF computes the fusion scores of the documents in the component lists based on an existing unsupervised data fusion method (steps 1 and 2 in Algorithm 1); in this paper we use CombSUM, as our experimental results in §5.1 and §5.2 show that CombSUM outperforms other plain fusion methods in most cases. In the second part (""Part II"" in Algorithm 1), DDF integrates fusion scores into an LDA topic model such that latent topics of the documents, their corresponding estimated relevance scores, and the multinomial distribution of the topics specific to each document can be inferred (steps 3­15 in Algorithm 1). In the last part (""Part III"" in Algorithm 1), DDF uses the outputs of Parts I and II as input for an existing diversification method; in this paper, we use PM-2 [13] because it is a the state-ofthe-art search result diversification model. Some concepts in PM-2, such as ""quotient"" and ""seat,"" play important roles in the definition of the diversification step; they will be discussed in §3.4.3.",null,null

We only focus on the diversification task, where the top-k documents returned should not only be relevant but also cover as many aspects as possible in response to a given query. In total, we have 200 ambiguous queries from the four years, with 2 queries (#95 and #100 in the 2010 edition) not having relevant documents.

The former two are set-based and indicate, respectively, the precision and mean average precision across all aspects of the query in the search results, whereas the remaining ones are cascade measures that penalize redundancy at each position in the ranked list based on how much of that information the user has already seen from documents at earlier ranks.",Y,null

We consider several baselines.

427,"Inspired by the success of baseline fusion methods on the diversification task, we now consider our newly proposed fusion method, DDF. Returning to Tables 2 and 3, two types of conclusion emerge. First, DDF outperforms all component runs (note that component runs in Table 2 are the best runs in the tracks), on all metrics, for all years. In other words, it is safe in the sense defined in Section 4.3. The difference between DDF and the best performing component run is always significant. We believe that the strong performance of DDF is due to the fact that DDF not only focuses on improving the relevance score of fused run but also explicitly tries to diversify the fused run.",null,null
,,,
428,"Second, DDF outperforms all baseline fusion methods, on all metrics. In many cases, CombSUMPM-2 and CombSUM yield the second and third best performance, respectively, but DDF outperforms them in every case, and often significantly so. DDF can beat CombSUMPM-2 as it tackles two main challenges in PM-2 (see §3.4.3), although they build on the same framework. CombSUMMMR follows a similar strategy as DDF but its performance is worse than that of DDF. This is due to the fact that MMR models documents as if they are centered around a single topic only. It is clear from Tables 2 and 3 that cluster-based data fusion methods (ClustFuseCombSUM, ClustFuseCombMNZ) sometimes perform a little worse than the standard fusion method they build on (CombSUM, CombMNZ). This is because cluster-based fusion focuses on relevance of the documents rather than on diversification.",null,null

429,5.3 Effect of the number of component lists,null,null

430,"Next, we zoom in on DDF. In particular, we explore the effect of varying the number of lists to be fused on its performance. Fig. 2 shows the fusion results of randomly sampling k  {2, 4, . . . , 26} lists from the 48 runs submitted to the TREC Web 2012 track plus the PM-2 runs (due to space limitations, we only report results using the 2012 runs; the findings on other years are qualitatively similar). For each k, we repeat the experiment 20 times and report on the average scores and the corresponding standard deviations indicated by the error bars in the figure. We use CombSUM as a representative example for comparison with DDF, as the results of other baseline fusion methods are worse or have qualitatively similar results to those of CombSUM. As shown in Fig. 2, DDF always outperforms CombSUM in terms of the Prec-IA, -nDCG and ERRIA evaluation metrics and the performance gaps remain almost unchanged, in absolute terms, no matter how many component lists are fused. One reason for this is that as DDF builds on CombSUM, it inherits the merits of the fusion method, and more importantly, at the same time it tries to infer latent topics and rerank the high",null,null

Here, again, we use CombSUMPM-2 as a representative, as it tends to outperform or equal the other fusion methods. Specifically, we report changes in the number of relevant documents for DDF against CombSUMPM-2 when fusing the 2012 runs in Table 2 in 2012; see Fig. 4. Red bars indicate the number of relevant documents that appear in the run of DDF but not the run of CombSUMPM-2, white bars indicate the number of relevant documents in both runs, whereas blue bars indicate the number of relevant documents that appear not in DDF but in CombSUMPM-2; topics are ordered first by the size of the red bar, then the size of the white bar, and finally the size of the blue bar.",null,null

468,"Clearly, the differences between DDF and CombSUMPM-2 in the top 5 and 10 are more limited than the differences in the top-15 and 20, but in all cases DDF outperforms CombSUMPM-2. E.g., in total there are 45 more relevant documents in the top 20 of the run produced by DDF than those in the CombSUMPM-2 run (49 relevant documents in DDF but not in CombSUMPM-2, 4 relevant documents in CombSUMPM-2 but not in DDF). We examine the matter further by comparing the Prec-AI@5, 10, 15, 20 scores of the DDF and CombSUMPM-2 runs for the 2012 data; see Table 4. The differences at small depths (5, 10) are weakly statistically significant while those at bigger depths are significant, confirming our observations in Fig. 4; we also find that DDF statistically significantly outperforms CombSUMPM-2 in terms of Prec-IA scores at depth 5, 10, 15 and 20, which again confirms the above observations based on Fig. 4.",null,null

,,,
535,"Finally, we examine the effect on the overall performance of the number of latent topics used in DDF, and contrast the performance of DDF with varying number of latent topics against DDF2, CombSUM and CombSUMPM-2. Here, DDF2 is the same algorithm as DDF except that for every test query it considers as many latent topics as there are aspects according to the ground truth. We use DDF2, DDF, CombSUM and CombSUMPM-2 to fuse the component result runs listed in Table 2 in 2012 as an example. We vary the number of latent topics in DDF from 2 to 16. See Fig. 5.",null,null
,,,
536,"When the number of latent topics used in DDF increases from 2 to 6, the performance of DDF increases dramatically. When only 2 latent topics are used, the performance is worse than that of CombSUM and CombSUMPM-2; e.g., Prec-IA@20 for DDF is 0.3404, while the scores of CombSUM and CombSUMPM-2 are 0.3592 and 0.3718, respectively. In contrast, when the number of latent topics varies between 8 to 16, the performance of DDF seems to level off. This demonstrates another merit of our fusion model, DDF: it is robust and not sensitive to the number of latent topics once the number of latent topics is ""large enough."" Another important finding from Fig. 5 is that DDF2 always enhances the performance of DDF, CombSUM and CombSUMPM-2, for all metrics, which demonstrates the fact that latent topics can enhance the performance. The performance differences between DDF2 and DDF are quite marginal and not statistically significant. We leave it as future work to dynamically estimate the number of aspects (and latent topics) of an incoming query and to use this estimate in DDF.",null,null

537,6. CONCLUSION,null,null
,,,
538,Most previous work on search result diversification focuses on,null,null
,,,
539,"the content of the documents returned by an ad hoc algorithm to diversify the results implicitly or explicitly, i.e., using implicit or explicit representations of aspects. In this paper we have adopted a different perspective on the search result diversification problem, based on data fusion. We proposed to use traditional unsupervised and state-of-the-art data fusion methods, CombSUM, CombMNZ, ClustFuseCombSUM, ClustFuseCombMNZ, CombSUMMMR and CombSUMPM-2 to diversify result lists. This led to the insight that fusion does aid diversification. We also proposed a fusion-based diversification method, DDF, which infers latent topics from ranked lists of documents produced by a standard fusion method, and combines this with a state-of-the-art result diversification model. We found that data fusion approaches outperform state-of-the-art search result diversification algorithms, with DDF invariably giving rise to the highest scores on all of the metrics that we have considered in this paper. DDF was shown to behave well with different numbers of component lists. We also found that DDF is insensitive to the number of latent topics of a query, once a sufficiently large number was chosen, e.g., 10.",null,null
,,,
540,"As to future work, we aim to incorporate into DDF methods for automatically estimating the number of aspects, which will be used to set the number of latent topics. The last and third part of DDF is based on a particular choice of method, viz. PM-2, and we only apply rank-based fusion methods for diversification. In future work we plan to compare these choices with alternative choices, and apply other fusion alternatives, e.g., score-based fusion methods.",null,null
