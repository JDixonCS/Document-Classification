4,ABSTRACT,null,null
5,"We present a study to understand the effect that negated terms (e.g., ""no fever"") and family history (e.g., ""family history of diabetes"") have on searching clinical records. Our analysis is aimed at devising the most effective means of handling negation and family history. In doing so, we explicitly represent a clinical record according to its different content types: negated, family history and normal content; the retrieval model weights each of these separately. Empirical evaluation shows that overall the presence of negation harms retrieval effectiveness while family history has little effect. We show negation is best handled by weighting negated content (rather than the common practise of removing or replacing it). However, we also show that many queries benefit from the inclusion of negated content and that negation is optimally handled on a per-query basis. Additional evaluation shows that adaptive handing of negated and family history content can have significant benefits.",null,null

7,1. INTRODUCTION,null,null
8,"Negation and reference to family history are two unique characteristics of clinical records that affect natural language processing of clinical text [3]. Commonly mentioned conditions in a patient record (e.g., ""fever"" or ""fracture"") often appear in negated form (e.g., ""denies fever"" or ""no fracture"") [3]. Previous research has largely focused on identifying the negated portions of text, or reference to family history content (e.g.,""family history of heart disease"") [3, 1]. From an information retrieval (IR) perspective, previous studies have considered how negation may adversely affect retrieval [5, 6]. For example, when searching patient records using the query ""patients with heart murmour"", the retrieval system might return a large number of irrelevant documents containing ""no heart murmur"". Traditional keyword-matching IR systems denote the presence of the query terms in a document",null,null

[5] found IR term-weighting methods naturally accounted for negation, while Limsopatham et al. [6] developed a technique that showed handling negation improved effectiveness.",null,null
11,"In this paper, we provide a specific analysis of how and why negation affects retrieval effectiveness. In doing so, we uncover why previous studies of negation in IR produced differing results. In addition to negation, we also consider how the reference to family history also influences IR effectiveness. We explicitly represent, within the language modeling framework, a clinical record according to its different content: negated, family history and normal (i.e., all other normal content); the importance of each of these content types is then weighted separately. Relevance of a particular document to a query is estimated based on the mix of the three content types within the document.",null,null
12,"An evaluation using the TREC Medical Records Track shows that handling negation does improve retrieval performance. However, further analysis revealed that many queries benefit from the inclusion of negated content. An outcome of this finding is that the common approach [8] of removing or replacing negated content from the document representation is sub-optimal; rather, negated content should be weighted separately, ideally on a per-query basis. The significant potential benefits of adaptive per-query handling of negated, family history and normal content are presented in further retrieval experiments.",null,null
13,2. RELATED WORK,null,null
14,"Accounting for negated terms in clinical text has been an important topic in health informatics, with much of the focus being within the computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP) fields. The main focus of these efforts is on negation detection and negated scope detection. Chapman et al.[2] developed NegEx, an algorithm which is effective in determining negated findings or diseases from clinical text. NegEx has become a common tool for identifying negated content; the tool was extended as the ConText algorithm, which in addition to negation also identifies hypothetical, or historical references in clinical text [4]. ConText was also extended to identify references to family history. Previous studies reported the effectiveness of NegEx to be at least 90% F-measure [2, 4].",null,null
15,Less research has been performed on the effect of negation on searching clinical text. Previous studies in this area have mainly considered how the negated content of a document can be removed or separated prior to indexing the docu-,null,null

This assumption was pervasive amongst teams participating in the TREC Medical Record Track: many participants dealt with negation by pre-processing clinical records with the NegEx algorithm to remove negated content [8].",null,null
18,"In this paper, we firstly empirically investigate the assumption that negation always harms retrieval performance. This is important to understand as previous studies differ in their findings on the effect of negation: Koopman et al. [5] found IR term-weighting methods naturally accounted for negation, while Limsopatham et al.[6] developed a technique that showed penalising negation improved effectiveness. In addition to the effect of negation, we also consider the less studied effect of family history references on clinical IR.",null,null
19,"The previous work described here, and the focus of this study, is on explicitly negated terms found in documents, which differs from other work concerned with negation in queries (e.g., the Boolean query ""hypertension NOT obesity""). Dealing with negation in queries presents its own set of challenges but is out of the scope of this study.",null,null

21,"We model retrieval as a language modeling process, where the standard document representation is enhanced to handle three different types of content within the document: negated, family history and normal.

32,Our experimental evaluation is conducted to answer the following research questions:,null,null
33,RQ1: What effect does negation have on overall retrieval effectiveness?,null,null
34,RQ2: What effect does family history have on overall retrieval effectiveness?,null,null

37,"The test collection used in our experiments was the TREC 2011 & 2012 Medical Records Track (MedTrack) [8]. The unit of retrieval was a patient record rather than an individual report; thus, reports belonging to a single patient's record were concatenated into a single document called a patient visit document.2 The resulting corpus contained 17,198 patient visit documents.",null,null
38,"The evaluation measures used in MedTrack 2011 were bpref and precision @ 10 (P@10). However, in MedTrack 2012 inferred measures and P@10 were used. Inferred measures required specific relevance assessments (prels) not available for 2011, but bpref and P@10 could be used for 2012 as qrels were available. While it is possible to separate the evaluation into two parts (34 queries for 2011 and 47 for 2012), it is more desirable to have a single, larger query set for more powerful statistical analysis. Therefore, we combine the query sets and use bpref and P@10.",null,null
39,"To evaluate RQ1 (the overall effect of negation), we adjust the weight of negated content while fixing the weights for normal and family history.

Instead, we consider two baselines to handle negation: that with neg "","" 0 (negation removal), which is used by most TREC system, and that with neg "","" -1 (negation penalisation), which resembles the strategy by Limsopatham et al.

A supervised machine learning method may be employed, with the optimal parameter settings identified here supplied as training data. In addition, a set of features must be selected which might indicate which content type is most important given the query; some useful features to choose in this regard might include statistics related to frequencies of occurrences of terms both in normal and negated content, and collection-level statistics, for example, how rare is a term and how often does it occur negated.",null,null
129,5. CONCLUSIONS,null,null
130,"This study provides an understanding of how and why negation affects clinical IR: overall, negation harms retrieval, family history has little effect. We show that assigning a negative weight to negated content is more effective than the common practise [8] of removing or ignoring this content. However, on an individual query level, negated content can be beneficial and therefore negated content within a document should not be ignored. The difference between overall retrieval effectiveness and individual query effectiveness explains the mixed results of previous studies in this area [5, 6]. Considering negated, family history and normal content separately is flexible and effective for handling these different content types. This approach can easily be applied to other content types beyond negation and family history. An analysis of the optimal weighting showed that significant improvements are possible if the right content mix is chosen. The analysis also reveled possible limitations of our study in that some errors could come from the NegEx and ConText algorithms (while NegEx does have F-measure 90% [2, 4], ConText has not been robustly evaluated). This may explain why no significant improvements were found when tuning the family history weights, although this may also indicate that family history is less important that negation. Future work will investigate an adaptive per-query method to automatically derive the importance of different content type in a clinical document to improve retrieval.",null,null
