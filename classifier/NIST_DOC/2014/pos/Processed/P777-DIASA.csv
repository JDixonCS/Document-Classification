14,"Different important studies in Web search results clustering have recently shown increasing performances motivated by the use of external resources. Following this trend, we present a new algorithm called Dual C-Means, which provides a theoretical background for clustering in different representation spaces. Its originality relies on the fact that external resources can drive the clustering process as well as the labeling task in a single step. To validate our hypotheses, a series of experiments are conducted over different standard datasets and in particular over a new dataset built from the TREC Web Track 2012 to take into account query logs information. The comprehensive empirical evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its significant advantages over traditional clustering and labeling techniques.",null,null

22,"Web search results clustering (SRC), also known as post-retrieval clustering, multifaceted clustering or ephemeral clustering has received much attention for the past twenty years. SRC systems return meaningful labeled clusters from a set of Web snippets retrieved from any Web search engine for a given user's query. So far, most works have focused on the study of topical clustering [9] although some studies have been appearing in temporal clustering [1] and geospatial clustering [39]. As a consequence, SRC systems",null,null

24,"can be particularly useful to understand query intents (topical clustering) and query diversity (temporal/geospatial clustering). In this paper, we particularly focus on topical SRC.",null,null
25,"As opposed to classical text clustering, SRC must deal with small text fragments (Web snippets) and be processed in run-time. As a consequence, it is hard to implement efficiently and effectively [9]. So, most successful methodologies follow a monothetic approach [40, 10, 12, 35]. The underlying idea is to discover the most discriminant topical words in the collection and group together Web snippets containing these relevant terms. On the other hand, the polythetic approach, in which the main idea is to represent Web snippets based on the Vector Space Model (VSM) has received less attention [18, 22, 41, 30]. The main reason is the fact that the labeling process is a surprisingly hard extra task [9].",null,null
26,"Our research is motivated by the fact that the adequate combination of the polythetic and monothetic approaches in a single algorithm should lead to improved performance over three important factors in SRC: clustering accuracy, labeling quality and partitionning shape. For that purpose, we present a new algorithm called Dual C-Means, which provides a theoretical background for dualrepresentation clustering. Its originality relies on the fact that different representation spaces can drive the clustering process as well as the labeling task in a single step.",null,null
27,"We evaluated the proposed algorithm over different metrics (e.g. F1N [13], Fb3 [2], ARI [37], D#-nDCG [34]), well-studied datasets (e.g. ODP-239 [10], SEMEVAL [28]) and different representation spaces (e.g. text and query logs). The results show that the combination of the VSM representation of Web snippets and a querylog-based representation of cluster centroids achieves the best configuration for the SRC task. In particular, increased performance is shown against most SRC solutions (e.g. STC [40], LINGO [30], TOPICAL [35], LDA [7]). Our main contributions are :",null,null

34,2. RELATED WORK,null,null
35,"A good survey of SRC methodologies can be found in [9]. As a consequence, we give a brief overview of older methodologies and focus on more recent works. The first important work in SRC is certainly proposed by [18]. They define a polythetic approach based on the VSM representation where similarity between documents is computed with cosine similarity measure. Then, a nonhierarchical partitioning strategy called fractionation is performed to discover the number of clusters suggested by the user. Initial results show that their ""approach to document clustering is one which can produce significant improvements over similarity search ranking alone"". Although they present the foundations of SRC, labeling is not tackled and evaluation is based on a small dataset and a limited user study.",null,null
36,"In order to propose a more realistic solution, which includes labeling, [40] defined the Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) algorithm. They propose a monothetic clustering technique, which merges base clusters with high string overlap. Instead of using the VSM representation, they propose to represent Web snippets as compact tries. Their evaluation over a small set of 10 queries shows that STC outperforms group-average agglomerative hierarchical clustering, K-Means, buckshot, fractionation and single-pass algorithms. STC is still considered as a hard baseline to compete with.",null,null
37,"Later, [30] proposed a polythetic approach called LINGO, which takes into account the string representation proposed by [40]. They first extract frequent phrases based on suffix-arrays. Then, they reduce the term-document matrix (defined as a VSM) using Single Value Decomposition to discover latent structures. Finally, they match group descriptions with the extracted topics and assign relevant documents to them. LINGO is evaluated with 7 users over a set of 4 search results and as such, no conclusive remarks can be drawn. However, their publicly available implementations of LINGO, STC and BiKM (Bi-section K-means) provide researchers with useful tools to build SRC systems.",null,null
38,"More recently, [10] showed that the characteristics of the outputs of SRC algorithms suggest the adoption of a meta clustering approach. For that purpose, they introduce a novel criterion to measure the concordance of two partitions of Web snippets into different clusters based on the information content associated with the decisions made by the partitions on single pairs of Web snippets. A meta clustering phase is then casted to an optimization problem of the concordance between the clustering combination and the given set of clusterings. The results of their OPTIMSRC system demonstrate that meta clustering is superior over individual clustering techniques. In particular, they propose a dataset called ODP-239, which is widely used in the community.",null,null
39,"Another polythetic methodology is proposed in [26]. Their underlying idea is that informative text similarity measures can improve SRC by adequately capturing the latent semantics conveyed by Web snippets. They propose a K-means based algorithm called GK-means within which a new objective function defined for a third-order similarity measure must be maximized. As different partitions are possible depending on the K value, they propose an automatic stopping criterion to retrieve one ""optimal"" clustering solution. Their main contribution is the fact that labels are built during the clustering process thus avoiding an extra processing step. Their results show improvements for ODP-239 in terms of Fb3 over all text-based SRC algorithms.",null,null
40,"While all studies mentioned so far treat the task of SRC as a textbased problem, some other works propose to introduce external re-",null,null
41,sources. The first relevant work is presented in [16] where Web snippets are enriched with anchor text information and high quality indexes extracted from DMOZ. The underlying idea of their monothetic approach called SNAKET is that better labeling and clustering can be obtained from these external resources. Results over a non-standard dataset show that the introduction of external information improves Precision at different clustering levels. [16] certainly proposed a new trend in SRC.,null,null
42,"Following the same idea, [35] proposed TOPICAL, a top performing SRC system over ODP-239 dataset. They propose to move away from the bag of words representation towards a graph of topics paradigm derived from TAGME, a wikification algorithm [38]. Each Web snippet is annotated with a set of topics, which are represented by Wikipedia articles. A bipartite-like graph structure is built where nodes are either Web snippets or topics and edges are either topic-to-topic or topic-to-snippet. Then, a spectral-like clustering algorithm is run over the graph to discover relevant clusters and meaningful labels. TOPICAL is an interesting approach as clustering is driven by the presence of Wikipedia titles in Web snippets and inderectly assures the quality of the labeling.",null,null
43,"Another idea has recently been proposed in [13], which relies on Web n-grams. In order to better capture the similarity between Web snippets, a first step consists in building a co-occurence graph based on Dice coefficient calculated over the Google Web1T corpus [8] from which senses are discovered by word sense induction algorithms. Each Web snippet is represented as a bag-of-words (polythetic approach) but Similarity is computed over discovered word senses. Their experiments show that enhanced diversification and clustering performance results can be obtained based on the adjusted RandIndex [37] for a specific dataset built for ambiguous queries (MORESQUE). Recently, researchers from the same team proposed a new dataset within the context of the SEMEVAL task 11 [28], in which the goal is to provide an evaluation framework for the objective comparison of word sense disambiguation and induction algorithms in SRC for ambiguous queries.",null,null
44,"All works propose interesting issues for SRC. On one hand, the monothetic approach mainly focuses on the identification of strong meaningful labels. The underlying idea is that good labels are a key factor for the success of user experience in Web search. On the other hand, the polythetic approach concentrates on discovering high quality clusters and the labeling task is usually treated as a separate process. The subjacent motivation is that good clustering should be provided to improve user experience in search for information. Moreover, recent studies show that the introduction of external resources improves overall results.",null,null
45,"In this paper, we propose that both monothetic and polythetic approaches should be combined in a single algorithm capable of accepting external resources. For that purpose, we present the Dual C-Means algorithm, which extends the well-known K-Means for dual representation spaces. It particularity relies on the fact that different representation spaces compete to reach high clustering quality and meaningful labeling. In particular, we propose that query logs are introduced as external information to ensure quality labeling and drive the clustering process.

As a consequence, we propose two different space representations: text-text (i.e. V1 , V2) and text-query logs (i.e. V1 , V2).",null,null

195,"The use of word similarity metrics is an important and interchangeable component of our algorithm encoded in the transition matrix. In this study, we propose the comparison of a total of five collocation metrics7. In particular, we used the Symmetric Conditional Probability (SCP) [36], the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) [11], the Dice coefficient [14], the LogLikelihood ratio (LogLike) [15] and 2 [17]. Each metric is defined in Table 2. The expressiveness of the Dual C-means permits the definition of different types of word similarity measures. As a consequence, we",null,null

In particular, for each snippet si  S, a simple word-word similarity measure is ST S where ST is the transposed of the snippetterm matrix S. In this case, P ,"" ST S. Another interesting similarity measure is LSA [20], which can be formulated as follows: P "","" U e UT where U  UT is the eigen decomposition of ST S, and e is the number of highest eigen values selected to represent the latent space8.""",null,null

199,"We aim to compare our algorithm to the most competitive strategies proposed so far in the SRC literature. For that purpose, we show the results of STC [40], LINGO [30], TOPICAL [35] and LDA [7]. It is worth noticing that for evaluation purposes, we developed an open source implementation9 of TOPICAL using the Wikipedia Miner API proposed by [24] and the spectral algorithm proposed by [29] included in SCIKit learning tool10. For LINGO and STC algorithms, we used the Carrot2 API11. And for LDA, we used the topic modeling package included in MALLET toolkit [23]. The parameters were set following the toolkit instructions (i.e. stop-words removal, t ,"" 0.01, w "", 0.01 and limited to 1000 iterations) and the cluster membership is assigned taken the maximum topic probability value.",null,null
200,Evaluation Metrics.,null,null
201,"Different metrics have been proposed to evaluate text clustering. Within this paper, we present the results for the most relevant metrics. The first complete study in terms of evaluation has certainly been proposed by [10]. In the specific case of SRC, the authors propose the F1C metric, which is a specific implementation of the more general F measure. Other metrics have also been proposed. For example, the Fb3 measure [2] addresses many important problems in clustering such as cluster homogeneity, completeness, rag-bag and size-vs-quantity constraints, and has shown interesting properties for the SRC task as formulated in [26]. Two other important metrics have been studied in [13]: F1N and the Adjusted RandIndex (ARI) [37]. In particular, F1N can be seen as a complementary metric of F1C as it is also based on the classical F measure but computed in a different manner12, while ARI evidences an interesting property for SRC. While it measures clustering accuracy, it also takes into account the fact that a given partition shows a similar partitioning shape compared with the reference gold standard. The underlying idea is that the number of clusters and the average number of Web snippets in each cluster approximate as much as possible the reference clustering. An illustration of this situation can be seen in [25] although the authors do not refer to this issue as an important one for SRC. In terms of implementation, we used the Java evaluator13 to compute both F1N and ARI evaluation metrics, and the implementation provided by [3]14 to compute Fb3 . In Table 3, we defined all the metrics used for our experiments.",null,null

The other benefit of this new dual approach may be embodied by the expressiveness of the query logs as meaningful labels. This is the objective of the next section.""",null,null

490,"As mentioned in [9], the labeling process plays an important role in the success of SRC systems. As a consequence, a clear objective evaluation is needed. However, this has not yet been the case. Indeed, [18][16] proposed user studies, which are difficult to replicate. In order to solve reproducibility problems, [10][35] proposed to evaluate the kSSL metric but their datasets are defined in two different ways and they are not publicly available. So, in order to propose a conclusive evaluation of the labeling process, we propose to use a new gold standard dataset provided by the Subtopic Mining subtask of the NTCIR-10 Intent-2 [32] and apply recent evaluation metrics proposed by [34]: I-rec@10, D-nDCG@10 and D#-nDCG@10.",null,null
491,"These metrics aim to measure Precision and Recall of the users' intents. Within our context, we can use the labels provided by the SRC algorithms as the users' intents candidates. If so, we can directly apply the given metrics. In particular, I-rec measures the number of intents discovered by the algorithm over the total different intents of the query. This metric can simply be viewed as an intent Recall. Then, D-nDCG is obtained by sorting all relevant intents by the global gain, which is defined as the sum of all the individual intent gains. Finally, the D#-nDCG metric is the linear combination of I-rec and D-nDCG, using  and 1 -  factors. Note that defining the probabilities of each intent as well as the relevant intents can be a hard task. However, as our experiments are realized over WEBSRC401 based on ClueWeb09, these values are known and publicly available [32]. In particular, the NTCIREVAL toolkit17 was used for the calculation of these metrics. Let us notice that for the specific task of SRC, we propose to use I-rec@10, D-nDCG@10 and D#-nDCG@10 as for most queries the number of intents is limited.

These results clearly point at this last configuration as the best compromise for clustering accuracy, labeling quality and partitioning shape.""",null,null
523,7. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES,null,null
524,"In this paper, we proposed a new algorithm called Dual C-Means, which can be seen as an extension of the classical K-Means for dual representation spaces. Its originality relies in the fact that the clustering process can be driven by external resources by defining two distinct representation spaces. In particular, we proposed",null,null
525,784,null,null
526,"that query logs are used as external information to guide clustering and afford meaningful labels to users in their search for information. We also built a new publicly available dataset called WEBSRC401 based on ClueWeb09, which affords a more realistic situation for Web SRC. A complete and reproducible evaluation was performed over different gold standard datasets (ODP-239 and SEMEVAL) based on different publicly available evaluation tools. In particular, a great deal of evaluation metrics have been applied over diffferent configurations of the Dual C-Means integrating distinct word-word similarity measures. Results showed that our approach steadily outperforms all existing state-of-the-art SRC algorithms in terms of clustering accuracy (Fb3 ) but is less competitive in terms of ARI. This situation is handled by the introduction of query logs, which allows high labeling quality with outperforming values of I - rec@10, D - nDCG@10 and D# - nDCG@10 and adequate partitioning shape with high values of ARI.",null,null
527,"The final findings that show that collocation metrics sensitive to high frequency events tend to produce high quality clusters and low frequency sensitive ones give rise to quality labels, is an interesting issue. Indeed, like the dual representation space, it suggests a multiobjective implementation of the dynamic reallocation algorithm to the problem of SRC. Moreover, the next steps that are being carried out are the introduction of different resources to drive the clustering process, the definition of new P transition matices taking into account recent developments in word-word similarity and the definition of powerful instantiation functions provided by the introduced general model.",null,null
