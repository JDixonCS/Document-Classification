12,ABSTRACT,null,null
,,,
13,"Current research on web search has focused on optimizing and evaluating single queries. However, a significant fraction of user queries are part of more complex tasks [20] which span multiple queries across one or more search sessions [26, 24]. An ideal search engine would not only retrieve relevant results for a user's particular query but also be able to identify when the user is engaged in a more complex task and aid the user in completing that task [29, 1]. Toward optimizing whole-session or task relevance, we characterize and address the problem of intrinsic diversity (ID) in retrieval [30], a type of complex task that requires multiple interactions with current search engines. Unlike existing work on extrinsic diversity [30] that deals with ambiguity in intent across multiple users, ID queries often have little ambiguity in intent but seek content covering a variety of aspects on a shared theme. In such scenarios, the underlying needs are typically exploratory, comparative, or breadth-oriented in nature. We identify and address three key problems for ID retrieval: identifying authentic examples of ID tasks from post-hoc analysis of behavioral signals in search logs; learning to identify initiator queries that mark the start of an ID search task; and given an initiator query, predicting which content to prefetch and rank.",null,null

30,"Within the context of this work, we focus on one specific type of information seeking need that drives interaction with web search engines and often requires issuing multiple queries Г namely intrinsically diverse tasks [30]. Table 1 gives examples of two intrinsically diverse tasks observed in a commercial web search engine. Intrinsic diversity, where diversity is a desired property of the retrieved set of results to satisfy the current user's immediate information need, is meant to indicate that diversity is intrinsic to the need itself; this is in contrast to techniques that provide diversity to cope with uncertainty in query intent (e.g., [jaguar]).",null,null
,,,
31,"Intrinsically diverse tasks typically are exploratory, comprehensive, survey-like, or comparative in nature. They may result from users seeking different opinions on a topic, exploring or discovering aspects of a topic, or trying to ascertain an overview of a topic [30]. While a single, comprehensive result on the topic may satisfy the need when available, several or many results may be required to provide the user with adequate information [30]. As seen in the examples, a user starting with [snow leopards] may be about to engage in an exploratory task covering many aspects of snow leopards including their lifespan, geographic dispersion, and appearance. Likewise when investigating remodeling ideas, a user may wish to explore a variety of aspects including cost, compliance with current codes, and common redecoration options. Note that the user may in fact discover these aspects to explore through the interaction process itself. Thus intrinsic diversity shares overlap with both exploratory and faceted search [9, 37]. However, unlike the more open-ended paradigm provided by exploratory search, we desire a solution that is shaped by the current user's information need",null,null

For example, for the query [snow leopards], our goal is to enable deeper user-driven exploration of that topic, by proactively searching for the relevant information that the user might want during the course of a session on that topic, thus reducing the time and effort involved in manual reformulations, aspect discovery, and so on.",null,null
,,,
34,"To this end, we aim to design a system that addresses two key problems needed for ID retrieval: detecting the start of an ID task, and computing an optimal set of ID documents to return to the user given engagement on an ID task. For the former, the system must be capable of predicting when a user is likely to issue multiple queries to accomplish a task, based on seeing their first ""initiator query"". To do this, we first develop a set of heuristic rules to mine examples of authentic intrinsic diversity tasks from the query logs of a commercial search engine. The resulting tasks provide a source of weak supervision for training classification methods that can predict when a query is initiating an intrinsically diverse task. With these predictive models, we characterize how ID initiators differ from typical queries. We then present our approach to intrinsically diversifying for a query. In particular, rather than simply considering different intents of a query, we incorporate queries that give rise to related aspects of a topic by estimating the relevance relationship between the aspect and the original query. Given the intrinsically diverse sessions identified through log analysis, we demonstrate that our approach to intrinsic diversification is able to identify more of the relevant material found during a session given less user effort, and furthermore, the proposed approach outperforms a number of standard baselines.",null,null

35,2. RELATED WORK,null,null
,,,
36,"The distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic diversity was first made by Radlinski et al. who coined these terms [30]. In contrast to extrinsically-oriented approaches, which diversify search results due to ambiguity in user intent, intrinsic diversification requires that results are both relevant to a single topical intent as well as diverse across aspects, rather than simply covering additional topical interpretations. Existing methods like maximal marginal relevance (MMR) do not satisfy these requirements well (cf. Sec. 5.3). Most diversification research has focused primarily on extrinsic diversity: this includes learning [39, 34] and non-learning approaches [6, 40, 7, 8]. Recent work [2], however, indicates real-world Web search tasks are commonly intrinsically diverse and require significant user effort. For example, considering average number of queries, total time, and prevalence of such sessions, common tasks include: discovering more information about a specific topic (6.8 queries, 13.5 min, 14% of sessions); comparing products or services (6.8 q, 24.8 m, 12%); finding facts about a person (6.9 q, 4.8 m, 3.5%); and learning how to perform a task (13 q, 8.5 m, 2.5%). Thus, improvements in retrieval quality that address intrinsically diverse needs have potential for broad impact.",null,null
,,,
37,"Some previous TREC tracks, including the Interactive, Novelty and QA tracks, studied intrinsic diversity-like problems in which retrieval effectiveness was partly measured in terms of coverage of relevant aspects of queries, along with the interactive cost to a user of achieving good coverage. However, our task and data assumptions differ from these tracks. For example, the Interactive tracks focused more on",Y,
,,,
38,"coverage of fact- or website-oriented answers, while our definition of query aspect is broader and includes less-focused subtopics. In addition to optimizing rankings to allow efficient exploration of topics, we also predict queries that initiate intrinsically diverse tasks, and show how to mine candidates for ID tasks from large-scale search log data.",null,null
,,,
39,"Session-based retrieval is a topic that has become increasingly popular. For example, Radlinski et al. [31] studied the benefit of using query chains in a learning-to-rank framework to improve ranking performance. Others have proposed different session-level evaluation metrics [17, 21]. Research in this area has been aided by the introduction of the Session track at TREC [22]; this has led to papers on session analysis and classification [27]. In particular, He et al. use a random walk on a query graph to find other related queries, which are then clustered and used as subtopics in their diversification system [16]. In our re-ranking approach, we also use related queries to diversify the results, but maintain coherence with the original query. Specifically, we identify a common type of information need that often leads to longer, more complex search sessions. However, in contrast to previous work, rather than using the session interactions up to the current point to improve retrieval for the current query, we use a query to improve retrieval for a user's future session and use sessions from query logs to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. While the TREC Session track evaluated the number of uncovered relevant examples for the final query, the emphasis was on the impact of session context up to the present query; in our case, we assume no previous context, but instead are able to characterize the need for intrinsic diversity based on the single query alone.",Y,null
,,,
40,"Session data has also been used to identify and focus on complex, multi-stage user search tasks that require multiple searches to obtain the necessary information [36, 24]. This has led to research on task-based retrieval [14, 15] where tasks are the unit of interest (as opposed to queries or sessions). Trail-finding research studies the influence of factors such as relevance, topic coverage, diversity and expertise [33, 38]. While these problems are certainly related to ours, tasks and trails tend to be more specialized and defined in terms of specific structures: e.g. tasks are characterized as a set or sequence of sub-tasks to be accomplished, while trails are defined in terms of specific paths of user behavior on the web graph. However, intrinsically diverse search sessions, e.g. as in Table 1, represent a broader, less structured category of search behavior. Similarly, our approach complements work on faceted search [23] and exploratory search [37] by providing a data-driven manner of discovering common facets dependent on the particular topic.",null,null
,,,
41,"Query suggestions are a well-established component of web search results with a large research literature: common approaches include using query similarity (e.g.[42]) or querylog based learning approaches (e.g. [19]). Query suggestions can play an important role for intrinsically diverse needs, because they provide an accessible and efficient mechanism for directing users towards potentially multiple diverse sets of relevant documents. Therefore, query suggestion techniques that do not merely provide simple reformulation of the initial query, but correctly diversify across multiple facets of a topic may be particularly helpful for intrinsically diverse needs. Thus, recent research on diversifying query suggestions [28] has partly inspired our retrieval approach.",null,null

42,Our approach is also motivated by recent work on interactive ranking. Brandt et al. [5] propose the notion of dynamic,null,null

Our objective formulation closely relates to another recent work on two-level dynamic rankings [32], which studied the benefit of interaction for the problem of extrinsic diversity. Similarly, user interaction has been found to help in more structured and faceted search tasks [41, 13], in cases such as product search. However, while presenting interactive, dynamic rankings is one user experience that offers a way to surface the improved relevance to users, our techniques are more general: they may be used to present a summary of the topic to the user, recommend unexplored options, anticipate and then crowdsource queries to trade off latency and quality by prefetching, and more.",null,null
,,,
45,"In contrast to previous work, we provide a way to not only identify complex search tasks that will require multiple queries but to proactively retrieve for future queries before the user has searched for them. Importantly, these future queries are neither simple reformulations nor completely unrelated, but are queries on the particular task that the user has started. Finally, we introduce diversification methods which, unlike previous methods, maintain coherence around the current theme while diversifying. Using these methods we demonstrate that we can improve retrieval relevance for a task by detecting an intrinsically diverse need and providing whole-session retrieval at that point.",null,null

46,3. INTRINSICALLY DIVERSE TASKS,null,null
,,,
47,"An intrinsically diverse task is one in which the user requires information about multiple, different aspects of the same topical information need. In practice, a user most strongly demonstrates this interest by issuing multiple queries about different aspects of the same topic. We are particularly interested in identifying the common theme of an intrinsically diverse task and when a user initiated the task. We unify these into the concept of an initiator query where, given a set of queries on an intrinsically diverse task, the query among them that is most general and likely to have been the first among these set of queries is called the initiator query. If multiple such queries exist, then the first among them from the actual sequence (issued by the user) is considered the initiator. We give importance to the temporal sequence since the goal is to detect the initiation of the task and provide support for it as soon as possible.",null,null
,,,
48,"While previous work has defined the concept of intrinsic diversity, there has been no further understanding of the problem or means to obtain data. We now identify and analyze authentic instances of intrinsically diverse search behavior, extracted from large-scale mining and analysis of query logs from a commercial search engine.",null,null

50,"Intuitively, intrinsically diverse (ID) tasks are topically coherent but cover many different aspects. To automatically identify ID tasks in situ where a user is attempting to accomplish the task, we seek to codify this intuition. Furthermore, rather than trying to cover all types of ID tasks, we focus on extracting with good precision and accuracy a set of tasks where each task is contained within a single search session. As a ""session"" we take the commonly used approach of demarcating session boundaries by 30 minutes of user inactivity [35]. Once identified, these mined instances could potentially be used to predict broader patterns of cross-session",null,null
,,,
51,"intrinsic diversity tasks [24, 1], but we restrict this study to mining and predicting the initiation of an ID task within a search session and performing whole-session retrieval at the point of detection.",null,null
,,,
52,"To mine intrinsically diverse sessions from a post-hoc analysis of behavioral interactions signals with the search results, we developed a set of heuristics to detect when a session is topically coherent but covering many aspects. These can be summarized as finding sessions that are: (1) longer Г the user must display evidence of exploring multiple aspects; (2) topically coherent Г the identified aspects should be related to the same overall theme rather than disparate tasks or topics; (3) diverse over aspects Г the queries should demonstrate a pattern beyond simple reformulation by showing diversity. Furthermore, since the user's interaction with the results will be used in lieu of a contextual relevance judgment for evaluation, we also desire that we have some ""satisfied"" or ""long-click"" results where we define a satisfied (SAT) click similar to other work as having a dwell of  30s or terminating the search session [11, 12].",null,null
,,,
53,"Given these criteria, we propose a simple algorithm to collect intrinsically diverse user sessions. Our algorithm uses a series of filters, explained in more detail below. When we refer to ""removing"" queries, we mean they were treated as not having occurred for any subsequent analysis steps. For sessions, with the exception of those we ""remove"" from further analysis in Step 4, we label all other sessions as intrinsically diverse or regular (i.e., not ID). We identify the initiator query as the first query that remains after all query removal steps, and likewise a successor query is any remaining query that follows the initiator in the session. More precisely, we use the following steps (in sequence) to filter sessions:",null,null
,,,
54,"1. Remove frequent queries: Frequent queries Г such as facebook or walmart Г that are often interleaved with more complex tasks can obscure the more complex task the user is accomplishing. Therefore, we remove the top 100 queries by frequency as well as frequent misspellings related to these queries.",null,null

57,"4. Remove sessions with no SAT Document: Since we would like to eventually measure the quality of rerankings for these session queries in a personal and contextual sense, we would like to ensure that there is at least one long-dwell click to treat as a relevance judgment. While this is not required for a session being an ID session, we simply require it for ease of evaluation. Thus, we removed sessions with no SAT clicks.",null,null
,,,
58,"5. Ensure topical coherence: As ID sessions have a common topic, we removed any successor query that did not share at least one common top ten result with the initiator query. Note that this need not be the same result for every aspect. While this restricts the set of interaction patterns we identify, it enables us to be more precise, while ensuring semantic relatedness, and does not rely on the weakness of assuming one fixed static ontology.",null,null

60,"6. Ensure diversity in aspects: Although we desire topical coherence across the queries, we do not want to identify simple reformulations or spelling corrections as aspects. Thus we restrict the syntactic similarity with the initiator query to avoid identifying trivial difference as substantially different aspects. To measure query similarity robust to spelling variations, we consistently use cosine similarity with character trigrams in this work. In particular, we remove queries where the similarity was more than 0.5.",null,null
,,,
61,"7. Remove long queries: We observed a small fraction of sessions matching the above filters appear to consist of copy/paste homework questions on a common topic. While potentially interesting, we focus in this paper on completely user-generated aspects and introduce a constraint on query length, removing queries of length at least 50 characters.",null,null
,,,
62,"8. Threshold the number of distinct aspects: Finally, to focus on diversity and complexity among the aspects, we threshold on the number of distinct successor queries. We identify a query as distinct when its maximum pairwise (trigram character cosine) similarity with any preceding query in the session is less than 0.6. Any session with less than three distinct aspects (including the initiator) are labeled as regular and those with three or more aspects are labeled as intrinsically diverse.",null,null
,,,
63,"Putting everything together, we ran this algorithm on a sample of user sessions from the logs of a commercial search engine from the period April 1ГMay 31, 2012. We used log entries generated in the English-speaking United States locale to reduce variability caused by geographical or linguistic variation in search behavior. Starting with 51.2M sessions comprising 134M queries, applying all but the SAT-click filter, with the Number of Distinct Aspects threshold at two, led to more than 497K ID sessions with 7.0M queries. These ID tasks accounted for 1.0% of all search sessions in our sample, and 3.5% of sessions having 3 queries or more (14.4M sessions)1. Further applying the SAT-click filter reduced the number to 390K. Finally, focusing on the more complex sessions by setting the Number of Distinct Aspects filter to three, reduced this to 146K sessions.",null,null
,,,
64,"Given that ID sessions require multiple queries, we hypothesize that ID sessions account for a disproportionately larger fraction of time spent searching by all users. To test this, we estimated the time a user spent in a session by the elapsed time from the first query to the last action (i.e., query or click). Sessions with a single query and no clicks were assigned a constant duration of 5 seconds. Here, the time in session includes the whole session once an ID task was identified in that session. Our hypothesis was confirmed: while ID sessions with at least 2 distinct aspects represented 1.0% of all sessions, they accounted for 4.3% of total time spent searching, showing the significant role ID sessions play in overall search activity.",null,null

Two assessors were given instructions similar to the description in the first paragraph of Section 3, examples of ID sessions such as those in Table 1, and all of the queries in the session and asked to label each session as regular or ID. The assessors had a 79% agreement with an inter-rater  agreement of 0.5875. Using each assessor as a gold-standard and taking the average, on sessions of length two or greater our extraction method has a precision of 73.9% and an accuracy of 73.7% (overall accuracy is higher because of single query sessions always being regular). Thus, with both good agreement and a moderate to strong accuracy and precision, the method provides a suitable source of noisy supervised labels. With enough data, we can hope to overcome the noise in the labels (as long as it is unbiased) with an appropriate learning algorithm [3].",null,null

68,4. PREDICTING INTRINSICALLY DIVERSE TASK INITIATION,null,null
,,,
69,"Given that we may want to alter retrieval depending on whether the user is seeking intrinsic diversity or not, we ask the question whether we can identify the initiator queries for intrinsically diverse tasks and treat this as a classification problem. In particular, while in Sec. 3 we used the behavioral signals of interaction between the initiator and successor queries of a session to automatically label queries with a (weak) supervised label, here we ask if we can predict what the label would be in the absence of those interaction signals Г a necessary ability if we are to detect the user's need for intrinsic diversity in an operational setting. Ultimately our goal is to enable a search engine to customize the search results for intrinsic diversity only when appropriate, while providing at least the same level of relevance on tasks predicted to be regular. Recognizing that in most operative settings, it is likely important to invoke a specialized method of retrieval only when confident, we present a precision-recall tradeoff but focus on the high precision portion of the curve.",null,null

71,"Data: We used a sample of initiator queries from the intrinsically diverse sessions described in Sec. 3.1 as our positive examples, and the first queries (after removing common queries as in Step 1 of Sec. 3.1) from regular sessions were used as negative examples. Note that since the label of a query, e.g. [foo], comes from the session context, it is possible that [foo] occurs in both positive and negative contexts. In order to only train to predict queries that were clearly either ID or regular, we dropped such conflicting queries from the dataset; this only occurred 1 out of every 5K ID sessions. Also to weigh each task equally instead of by frequency, we sample by type: i.e., we treat multiple occurrences of a query in the positive (resp. negative) set as a single occurrence. Finally, we downsample to obtain a 1:1 ratio from the positive and negative sets to create a balanced set. Unless otherwise mentioned, the dataset was sampled to contain 61K queries and split into an 80/5/15 proportion (50000 training, 3000 validation, 8000 test) with no class bias.",null,null

Features with values spanning multiple orders of magnitude, such as the number of impressions, were first scaled down via the log function. Due to the large scale of our data, coverage of some features is limited. In particular, query classification was done similar to [4] by selecting the top 9.4M queries by frequency from a year's query logs previously in time and then using a click-based weighting on the content-classified documents receiving clicks2. Likewise Stats and QLOG features are built from four months' worth of query logs and have limited coverage as a result.

Specifically, we propose a reranking scheme that looks to satisfy not only the information need of the issued query, but also the future queries that the user is likely to issue later in the session on other aspects of the task. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the problem of jointly satisfying the current query as well as future queries (unlike anticipatory search [25] which focuses solely on the latter).",null,null

167,"We will use an interactive ranking-based paradigm here, using an approach related to the two-level rankings proposed in [32]. Given an issued query representing the start of an ID task, we consider rankings where each result can be attributed to some aspect of that task. We represent each aspect of the ID task by a related query of the issued query. One way this could be surfaced on a results page for a user is by placing the related query for an aspect adjacent to its corresponding search result. In such a setting, clicking on the related query could lead to results for that query being presented, thus enabling the user to explore documents for that aspect. This brings us to the question of how we find such a ranking.",null,null

To analyze impact when most of the sessions are ID and more complex, the MINED dataset is obtained directly from the filtering algorithm by setting the threshold on the Number of Distinct Aspects to be 5. To determine the reranking impact when sessions may be a mixture of both ID and regular sessions, the MIXED dataset was obtained by predicting when a session was ID using the classifier from Sec. 4 over a mixture of the MINED dataset sessions and a random sample of regular sessions of the same size. More specifically, the combined sessions were split in a 45-10-45 split of training-validation and test sets. The trained classifier was used to classify the test set sessions as being ID or not, based on the initiator query. The sessions predicted as ID formed the MIXED dataset (prediction accuracy of 68.8% over the combined sessions); for those not predicted to be ID, we assume the standard ranking algorithm would be applied and thus relevance would be the same on those. The MIXED dataset is a reflection of an operational setting, where the query issued is used to predict if the resulting session will be an ID session or not, and the ones predicted to be ID are selected for re-ranking.",Y,null

As seen in the results of Table 7, the re-ranking leads to improvements across the different metrics for both datasets. Thus, even without interactivity, the method is able to outperform the baselines in predicting future results of interest to the user, while also providing results for the current query. In particular, we found the DynRR method works best using the C+S related queries (which we return to later) with 9-11% gains over the baselines at position 10 across the various metrics with 3-5% relative gains. We also find that the method improves on the MIXED dataset supporting the question of whether the method can be robustly used in practical scenarios. Thus we improve an important segment of tasks while maintaining high levels of performance elsewhere; further improvements to the initiator classification model will improve the robustness further.",Y,null

354,"Interactive Evaluation: Next we evaluate the performance of the method while incorporating the interactivity. As seen in Table 8, the added interactivity leads to large increases in both the precision and DCG of the user paths navigated, across the different user models and datasets. In fact, we find 30-40% improvements in precision and 20-25% improvements in DCG, indicating that we are able to do a far better job in predicting future relevant results, and potentially, queries. These results also show that the method improvements are relatively robust to the user model.",null,null

355,"Robustness: A key concern when comparing a new method against a baseline, is the robustness of the method. In particular, we are interested in the number of queries that are either improved or hurt, when switching from the Baseline method to the proposed re-ranking method. This is particularly crucial for the MIXED dataset, as we would want that the performance on non-ID sessions not be severely affected. Table 9 displays the % of examples for which the method either gains or loses above a certain threshold, compared to the Baseline method. We see that the number of gains far exceeds the number of losses, especially while comparing the interactive metric. We should also note that for",null,null

385,"Effect of related query set: Next we study the impact of the related queries on the method performance, using the MINED dataset. To do so, we considered different combinations of the four related query sources: API(A), ClickGraph(C), Co-Session(S) and Oracle(O). Table 10 shows the results. As we clearly see, the related query source can make a significant impact on both the primary ranking performance and the interactive performance. One thing which stands out is the extremely strong performance using the Oracle related queries, which suggest that any improvements we can make in the quality of the suggested related queries is likely to result in even better overall performance. On the other hand, we see that using the API related queries almost always hurts performance. In fact, simply using only the related queries from the click-graph and the co-session data leads to much better performance than that compared to using the API queries as well. Further analysis reveals that this is due to two reasons: (a) In many cases, the queries returned by the API are spelling corrections or reformulations, with no difference in aspect; (b) most importantly though, there is little to no diversity in the queries obtained from the API compared to those from the other sources.",Y,null

,,,
452,"In this paper, we studied intrinsically diverse tasks that typically require multiple user searches on different aspects of the same information need. As this is just the first step into this problem, this also opens many interesting future directions Г such as iterative ways to combine the mining and query identification process or extending these techniques to other related problems like exploratory search. In this work, we motivated the problem using real-world data and presented an algorithm to mine data from search logs using behavioral interaction signals within a session. We then looked at the problem of identifying the queries that start these sessions, and treated it as a classification problem, along with an analysis of these queries. Finally, we presented an approach to alter the rankings presented to the user, so as to also provide them information on aspects of the task for which the user will search in the future. We validated our approach empirically using search log data, as well as TREC data, demonstrating significant improvement over competitive baselines in both cases.",Y,null
