5,"Search result clustering (SRC) is a post-retrieval process that hierarchically organizes search results. The hierarchical structure offers overview for the search results and displays an ""information lay-of-land"" that intents to guide the users throughout a search session. However, SRC hierarchies are sensitive to query changes, which are common among queries in the same session. This instability may leave users seemly random overviews throughout the session. We present a new tool called InfoLand that integrates external knowledge from Wikipedia when building SRC hierarchies and increase their stability. Evaluation on TREC 2010-2011 Session Tracks shows that InfoLand produces more stable results organization than a commercial search engine.",Y,null

11,"Search result clustering (SRC) [1, 4] is a post-retrieval process that hierarchically organizes search results. It is used in Meta search engines such as Yippy.com (previously known as Clusty). SRC hierarchies display an information ""lay of land"" for search and help users to quickly locate relevant documents from piles of search results.",null,null
,,,
12,"Session search has recently attracted more attentions in Information Retrieval (IR) research. A session usually contains multiple queries. These queries are usually highly related to a main topic and to each other. Ideal SRC hierarchies generated for queries in the same session should be highly related too. However, the state-of-the-art SRC hierarchies are usually sensitive to query changes and hence",null,null

17,"The reason that causes unstable hierarchies lies in the fact that that many hierarchy construction approaches are datadriven [1, 4].

35,2. BUILD STABLE CONCEPT HIERARCHIES,null,null
,,,
36,"We propose three major steps in building stable concept hierarchies: concept extraction, mapping to Wiki entries, and hierarchy construction. First, a single query q and its search results D are processed and a set of concepts C that best represents D are extracted by algorithms described in [5]. Concepts from the hierarchy built by Yippy are also included in C.",null,null
,,,
37,"Next, for a concept c  C, InfoLand maps it to its most relevant Wiki entry e, which is called a reference Wiki entry. We built a Lemur2 index over the entire Wikipedia collection in ClueWeb09.3 A concept c is sent as a query to the index and the top 10 returned Wiki pages are examined. The titles of these pages are considered as candidate Wiki entries for c and are denoted as {ei}, i ,"" 1 · · · 10. Due to ambiguity in natural language, the top returned results may not be related to the current search session. We hence disambiguate Wiki entries by measuring the similarity between the entires and the topics mentioned in the search queries. The similarity is measured by by mutual information between an entry candidate ei and all concepts C for query q:""",Y,null

,,,
119,Search results hierarchies built for queries in the same session are usually sensitive to query changes. This partly diminishes the benefits that search result organization intents to offer. We present a new tool called infoLand that incorporates external knowledge to improve the stability of SRC hierarchies and enable them to better serve as information lay-of-land to guide session search. Evaluation over TREC 2010 and 2011 Session tracks demonstrates that InfoLand produces more stable hierarchies than Yippy.,Y,null
