10,"Prior research in resource selection for federated search mainly focused on selecting a small number of information sources that are most relevant to a user query. However, result novelty and diversification are largely unexplored, which does not reflect the various kinds of information needs of users in real world applications.",null,null
,,,
11,"This paper proposes two general approaches to model both result relevance and diversification in selecting sources, in order to provide more comprehensive coverage of multiple aspects of a user query. The first approach focuses on diversifying the document ranking on a centralized sample database before selecting information sources under the framework of Relevant Document Distribution Estimation (ReDDE). The second approach first evaluates the relevance of information sources with respect to each aspect of the query, and then ranks the sources based on the novelty and relevance that they offer. Both approaches can be applied with a wide range of existing resource selection algorithms such as ReDDE, CRCS, CORI and Big Document. Moreover, this paper proposes a learning based approach to combine multiple resource selection algorithms for result diversification, which can further improve the performance. We propose a set of new metrics for resource selection in federated search to evaluate the diversification performance of different approaches. To our best knowledge, this is the first piece of work that addresses the problem of search result diversification in federated search. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches has been demonstrated by an extensive set of experiments on the federated search testbed of the Clueweb dataset.",null,null

17,1. INTRODUCTION,null,null
,,,
18,"Federated search, also known as distributed information retrieval [28, 4, 14], focuses on searching information distributed across multiple information sources such as local repositories or verticals. There are three major sub-problems in federated search: resource representation obtains information about contents and other key properties of each individual information source, resource selection selects a small number of most useful sources given a user query, and result merging integrates individual ranked lists from selected sources into a single final list. A large body of research has been conducted for resource selection in federated search [4, 28]. However, little is known about selecting a set of sources that balances relevance and novelty. This substantially limits the usability of federated search in many applications.",null,null
,,,
19,"On the other side, search result diversification has been studied extensively in ad hoc search in order to offer more coverage for ambiguous and multifaceted queries. In several occasions, users' intents in their queries may not be expressed explicitly. For example, an ambiguous query such as ""Jaguar"" may refer to an animal or a car model; or a multifaceted query such as ""Batman"" may refer to a name of a movie, a comic character, or the comic itself. Search result diversification circumvents this problem by explicitly or implicitly considering probable aspects of the query and presenting the search results in a way that is easier for users to find the needed information. Since 2009, the TREC Web track has incorporated diversification in the evaluation of the Web track [9]. Several evaluation metrics have been developed in ad hoc search to measure the effectiveness of different approaches of search result diversification.",Y,null
,,,
20,"Search result diversification in federated search may not be as simple as diversifying the final ranked list obtained from the selected sources. In a federated environment where documents of a same source cover similar topics, selecting a set of sources that balances relevance and novelty becomes crucial. As for the example of the query ""Jaguar"" above, if the sources related to ""Jaguar"" as a car dominate the resource selection result, it will be much harder to obtain a diversified ranked list in the end.",null,null

21,"This paper proposes new approaches in diversifying results of resource selection in federated search. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that tackles the issue. First, a set of new metrics is designed for measuring result diver-",null,null

The metrics can incorporate any diversity measure that has been developed in ad hoc search, including the intent-aware expected reciprocal rank (ERR) [7], -nDCG@k [13] and MAP-IA [1]. Second, two general approaches are proposed for diversifying resource selection. The first approach extends the ReDDE framework and utilizes a ranked list of documents on the centralized sample database. By reranking the sample documents with respect to result diversification, a better set of sources can be obtained in term of relevance and aspect coverage. The second approach offers a different view. Instead of reranking the sample documents based on their relevance to the query aspects, the information sources are reranked in a similar process. This can be done by estimating the relevance of each information source with respect to different aspects of the query by any existing resource selection algorithm. Furthermore, a learning based classification approach is proposed to combine multiple resource selection algorithms for a better estimation of source relevance with respect to query aspects. With some training data, the learning based classification approach can improve the effectiveness of resource selection for search result diversification.",null,null
,,,
24,"An extensive set of experiments has been conducted with the federated search testbed of the Clueweb dataset to evaluate the proposed research. In many experimental settings, the new approaches can successfully improve result diversification over traditional approaches that only consider document relevance. In particular, the new approaches provide superior performance on two test levels: source-level results of resource selection and document-level results of the final ranked list of federated document retrieval. Finally, the learning based approach, which combines results from multiple resource selection algorithms, outperforms each individual algorithm in result diversification.",null,null

25,The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 offers the literature review on both resource selection in federated search and result diversification in ad hoc search. Section 3 discusses our proposed metric to measure the diversity of selected sources. Section 4 proposes the two result diversification approaches for resource selection in federated search. Section 5 presents the learning based classification approach. The new proposed research is examined by an extensive set of experiments in Sections 6 and 7. Section 8 concludes our work and points out some potential research directions in the future.,null,null

,,,
27,"Considerable research have been conducted for all three sub-problems of federated search as resource representation, resource selection and result merging [4, 28, 15]. This section provides a discussion of prior research on resource selection, as well as a brief review on resource representation and result merging. We also discuss some popular ad hoc search algorithms for search result diversification.",null,null
,,,
28,Resource representation is the first step of federated search for obtaining important properties of distributed information sources such as content and size statistics. Query-based sampling [4] is a common approach as it obtains sample documents from available sources with randomly generated queries. The sample documents obtained in this process can be placed together in a centralized sample database.,null,null
,,,
29,Resource selection selects a small number of most relevant information sources for a user query. Some early resource,null,null
,,,
30,"selection algorithms such as CORI [4], CVV [37] and KL [36] treat each source as a big document and derive useful statistics to rank available sources with respect to a user query. However, these algorithms have limitation of losing the boundaries of individual documents, and thus may underestimate a big source with many relevant documents. Topic modeling has been proposed by recent work to overcome this limitation [3].",null,null
,,,
31,"Other resource selection algorithms such as ReDDE [32], DTF [17], CRCS [27] and SUSHI [33] step away from the big document assumption by modeling individual documents of a source. Several selection algorithms in this category rely on the centralized sample database to build a ranked list of sample documents for a user query, and then assign a relevance score to available sources based on the scores of their sample documents in the list. Different algorithms use different methods for aggregating document contribution to available sources. Recent work by Markov et al. follows a similar approach, but attempts to minimize uncertainty in the centralized sample database by sampling different queries, retrieval systems, or rankings [22].",null,null
,,,
32,"Learning based models have also been proposed for resource selection. They treat resource selection in federated search [20], or vertical search [2] as a classification problem. In particular, given a set of training queries and some relevance judgment, a classification model can learn to predict the relevance of an information source. In some experiments, the classification approaches have been shown to provide more accurate resource selection results than traditional algorithms without the training process.",null,null
,,,
33,"Result merging is the last step in federated search, which merges documents returned by selected sources into a single ranked list. Modern methods such as SSL [31] and SAFE [30] both attempt to merge documents by approximating the centralize retrieval results in different ways.",null,null
,,,
34,"Existing research in federated search have not explored an important issue of result novelty and diversification, which limits their abilities in representing the various information needs of users. The research work in [29] estimates the degree of document overlap among available sources, but its focus is only on duplicate documents and does not directly address the diversification problem related with multiple aspects of user queries. Other research work in [25] and [39] address diversification in aggregated search, which is similar to federated search, but operates in cooperative environments. Most importantly, those work do not target diversification in selecting relevant verticals (or sources) directly.",null,null
,,,
35,"On the other hand, result diversification has been a popular research topic in ad hoc search. Its goal is to make a trade-off between relevance and novelty in ranking documents [38, 5, 1, 6, 26]. In order to achieve the desired effect of covering sufficient aspects of a user query (so that user will likely find the sought information), diversification algorithms target on discovering novel aspects that have not been covered in the ranked list, and reducing the redundancy information shared between multiple documents.",null,null
,,,
36,"The earlier generation of diversification algorithms do not explicitly consider multiple aspects of a query [5, 38]. Instead, they build the ranked list from top to bottom, and make a choice of whether to include a document based on its similarity with existing documents in the list. More recent diversification algorithms directly incorporate query aspects into consideration. Agrawal et al. proposed the use of tax-",null,null

Carterette and Chandar directly optimized the ranked list with respect to evaluation measures based on diversity [6]. Santos et al. proposed the eXplitcit Query Aspect Diversification (xQuAD) method, which estimates the surplus information that a document can add to a ranked list, using the probability of relevance with respect to all aspects of the query [26]. Recently, Dang and Croft proposed a different view on diversification by preserving the proportionality of document presence with respect to each aspect of the query [16]. Their proposed algorithm PM-2 has proven to achieve superior performance over several other algorithms of the same category. Other recent work on search result diversification include a combination of implicit and explicit topic representations [19], personalized diversification [34], and explicit relevance model [35].",null,null

39,3. DIVERSIFICATION METRICS IN RESOURCE SELECTION FOR FEDERATED SEARCH,null,null
,,,
40,"There exists several standard diversification metrics for ad hoc search. However, no evaluation metric has been developed to compare the diversification results of different resource selection algorithms in federated search. This section proposes a new metric in order to fill that gap. Our metric is based on the popular R-metric [4] for resource selection in federated search. It is calculated as the ratio between the number of relevant documents contained in sources selected by a particular algorithm, over the number of relevance documents in sources selected by an ideal algorithm. In particular, the R-metric is defined as:",null,null

The optimal ranking of documents in S is the list that achieves the best score with respect to metric M. For most of the aforementioned metrics, finding the optimal ranked list is an NP-hard problem, but this can be acceptably approximated by a greedy algorithm (i.e., repeatedly select the next document that maximizes the metric given the current ranking; cf. [8, 13]). The intuition of the proposed metric is that, if we can select a minimal set of sources that contains enough diversified documents to reach the optimal measure, then the R-based diversification metric is maximized to 1. Otherwise, it gives us an estimation of how far our selected sources are from the optimal ones.",null,null

57,"source. The R-based diversification metric returns 1 if all available sources are selected. In general, for comparison between different resource selection algorithms, the maximum number of sources is determined beforehand.",null,null
,,,
58,4. TWO APPROACHES FOR DIVERSIFICATION IN RESOURCE SELECTION,null,null
,,,
59,This section proposes two approaches for selecting diversified information sources. The first approach extends the ReDDE framework by ranking sample documents with consideration to diversity. The second approach estimates the source relevance to each aspect of the query and ranks the sources based on the estimations of their aspect relevance.,null,null
,,,
60,4.1 Diversification on Sample Documents under ReDDE framework,null,null
,,,
61,"We first describe the Relevant Document Distribution Estimation (ReDDE) framework [32] for ranking sources based on the centralized sample database. In this framework, a given query is issued to the centralized sample database to retrieve a ranked list of sample documents. ReDDE makes an assumption that each sample document in this list represents a number of (unseen) documents from the source that it belongs to. Based on that, a source score is calculated by aggregating all contribution from its sample documents. The amount of contribution is scaled up depending on the source's size. Original ReDDE assigns a constant score for all documents on the top part of the returned list, and multiplies that constant with the ratio of the estimated source size over the sample size. The obtained quantity is then used for aggregating source scores. The CRCS resource selection algorithm [27] follows the same approach, but varies the amount of contribution of each document by an exponential decay function, as documents further down the ranked list have less contribution to its source.",null,null
,,,
62,"ReDDE and many other algorithms of the same family such as CRCS and SUSHI [33] utilize a ranking on the centralized sample database to estimate the relevance of available sources. For algorithms of this family, they mostly vary in the way of defining a utility function for each document in the list. Having said that, the original ranked list from the centralized sample database plays an important role. Nondiversification algorithms target on building a centralized ranked list that covers as many relevant documents to the query as possible. In many cases, this may not pay enough attention to sources that cover multiple query aspects. For diversification purpose, we should be careful when selecting a source that mainly contains documents relevant to an aspect that has been covered before.",null,null
,,,
63,"The above observation suggests a way to achieve good search diversification results by constructing a ranked list that covers several aspects of the query. We call this approach Diversification approach based on sample Documents (DivD). Instead of building a centralized ranked list that focuses only on relevance, we construct a ranked list that offers more diversity. The goal is to reduce the contribution of a document (on behalf of its source) that may be relevant to the query, but offers less novelty in the overall ranking.",null,null
,,,
64,"This approach can combine a wide range of resource selection algorithms with any diversification algorithm that has been developed before, for instance, PM-2 [16] and xQuAD [26], which were mentioned in Section 2. A typical example",null,null

75,"Some resource selection algorithms utilize the relevance score of each document in the centralized sample ranked list for ranking sources (e.g. ReDDE.top [2]). In the diversification approach that has been discussed so far, this relevance score can be replaced by the diversity score given by a diversification algorithm for ad hoc search. There are different interpretations about those diversity scores, depending on the assumptions made by the diversification algorithms. In our experiments, diversity scores can be used with most resource selection algorithms effectively.",null,null
,,,
76,4.2 Diversification Approach based on Sourcelevel Estimation,null,null
,,,
77,"The second approach follows a different strategy than the first one. As presented in the previous section, the diversification approach based on sample documents works directly on the ranked list of sample documents, which is not a natural component for resource selection algorithms similar to CORI. Indeed, several resource selection algorithms utilize summary statistics of a source to estimate its relevance to a query. It is not straightforward to apply a diversification method based on individual sample documents for those kinds of algorithms.",null,null
,,,
78,"This paper proposes another diversification approach for resource selection that operates at the source level. More specifically, many existing diversification algorithms for ad hoc search rank documents by estimating their relevance with respect to each aspect of the query, and then harvesting this information in order to produce a ranked list that balances multiple query aspects. It is possible to design a similar process that uses the estimated source relevance with respect to each aspect of the query. More specifically, instead of building a diversified list of documents for a given query as in ad hoc search, we can build a diversified list of available sources in a similar manner. All estimations with respect to the documents can be replaced by estimations with respect to the sources. This resource selection approach for results diversification is called Diversification approach based on Source-level estimation (DivS).",null,null
,,,
79,"An important step in DivS is therefore to compute the probability of relevance of a source with respect to a query aspect. Many existing resource selection algorithms are able to provide such information. CORI can directly provide a relevance estimation based on the big document assumption. ReDDE and CRCS do not provide direct estimations, but it is possible to use their source scores aggregated from sample documents for such a purpose. An example of the",null,null

80,diversification approach based on source-level estimation using ReDDE and PM-2 algorithms is presented in Algorithm 2.,null,null
,,,
81,"Compared with diversification approach based on sample documents, the diversification approach based on sourcelevel estimation can work with a wider range of resource selection algorithms. On the other hand, it requires multiple runs of a resource selection algorithm for all different aspects of a query, which is more time consuming than the former approach. In real-world applications, it is possible to design a parallel solution for multiple resource selection runs to speed up the process.",null,null
,,,
82,5. A CLASSIFICATION APPROACH FOR COMBINING DIVERSIFICATION RESULTS,null,null
,,,
83,"The two diversification approaches based on sample documents and source-level estimation both utilize a specific resource selection algorithm and a diversification algorithm for ad hoc search. It is possible to combine the results of multiple resource selection algorithms for search result diversification, which may provide better results by modeling complementary results from different algorithms. This section proposes a learning based classification approach. With some training information, this method can learn how to combine evidence supporting available sources from different resource selection algorithms for result diversification.",null,null
,,,
84,"In particular, we adapt the classification-based approach that has been used for both vertical search [2] and federated search [20]. For collecting training information in learning the classification model, this approach generates a pseudorelevant judgment of a source given a query by counting the number of relevant documents that the source contains. If the number is higher than some threshold value  , the source is considered to be relevant. In this paper, the training dataset for result diversification consists of multiple instances, each of them represents a pair of a source and a query aspect. A source is considered relevant to a query aspect if it contains at least one document relevant to that aspect of the query. For each pair of a source and a query aspect, we utilize the source score information from the following resource selection algorithms as features:",null,null

123,"With CRCS, the top 500 sample documents returned by the centralized sample database are considered. The exponential decay function of CRCS makes it more stable on the Clueweb collection, which exhibits a highly skewed distribution of source sizes. On the other side, ReDDE.top is more sensitive to noise in such an environment, as a notso-relevant sample document from a really big source may result in too much bias in favor of that source and affects the final ranked list. Therefore, for ReDDE.top, we set the number of top sample documents for each query to be smaller than CRCS's, chosen from the set {50, 100, 150, · · · }. We report the results using top 50 documents for ReDDE.top as it provides the most consistent performance.",null,null

We also report the results on the testing set of all other algorithms for comparison. For the scenario with suggested aspects of user queries, since there is no corresponding relevance judgment, we train our model using the provided query subtopics/aspects and their corresponding relevance judgments.

We then evaluate the final ranked list by the five metrics mentioned above as ERR-IA, -nDCG, NRBP, P-IA and S-Recall.

We conduct experiments on two levels for different purposes: source-level results for resource selection and document-level results for federated document retrieval. More specifically, the first subsection compares the performance of a diversification approach with standard resource selection algorithms. The second set of experiments in 7.2 compares multiple resource selection algorithms adapting DivD and DivS approaches. The third set of experiments in 7.3 demonstrates the advantage of the learning based approach (LR-DivS) over approaches with a single resource selection algorithm.

In particular, we choose to study the first diversification approach based on sample documents (DivD) in this subsection as they are more related with standard ReDDE.top and CRCS algorithms, while more results of both diversification approaches will be presented shortly.",null,null
,,,
136,618,null,null
,,,
137,"Table 2 shows the performance using all the R-based diversification metrics described in the previous section. Without diversification, it can be observed that the standard CRCS significantly outperforms standard ReDDE.top in all metrics. This may be attributed to the fact that CRCS generally selects more relevant sources to the query, which leads to a wider range of aspects being covered. The advantage of CRCS may come from using the exponential decay function for document utility, which tends to be better than using document score as utility in ReDDE.top. When the document-based diversification approach is applied, it further increases the performance of the standard algorithms: D-ReDDE.top significantly outperforms ReDDE.top in its capacity of selecting diversified sources. As for CRCS, its diversification version (i.e., D-CRCS) is also consistently better than the standard CRCS algorithm. The same observation can be seen in both scenarios when the query aspects are given, or suggested by Web search.",null,null

139,"This subsection studies the performance of the two proposed resource selection approaches (i.e., DivD and DivS) using several resource selection algorithms, including ReDDEtop, CRCS, Big Document and CORI. The results are presented in Table 3. In all settings, the standard Big Document and standard CORI algorithms are outperformed by the other methods. Furthermore, both S-Big Document and S-CORI, which are under the same assumption of collapsing sample documents within a source, are inferior to SReDDE.top and S-CRCS. These results indicate that ReDDEtop and CRCS tend to be more effective in resource selection for result diversification than Big Document and CORI, which is consistent with previous research in federated search for resource selection without diversification.",null,null
,,,
140,"Both DivD and DivS approaches produce comparable results when applied to ReDDE.top and CRCS. The D-CRCS version based on sample documents is better than its counterpart based on source-level estimation (i.e., S-CRCS), whereas the contrary is observed for ReDDE.top. In case of ReDDE.top, the difference is significant, which may be explained by the fact that when the original ranked list is short (only 50 for ReDDE.top), it is more difficult for the diversification algorithm to find a document that covers many query aspects, rather than finding a source that covers many aspects.",null,null
,,,
141,"The results using the provided query aspects and suggested ones reveal an interesting observation. We notice that the performance of the two settings are quite comparable with little difference. One possible explanation is that, in federated environment, it may not need a perfect set of query aspects for selecting a diversified set of information sources, as sources are already somehow divided by different types of semantic topics. Since our goal is to select sources that can cover as many query aspects as possible, the resource selection algorithms can do a reasonably good work as long as the suggestions of query aspects provide some meaningful interpretations of different aspects of the query.",null,null

Table 4 presents the results. The performance of the standard resource selection algorithms and their diversification counterparts are better on the set of testing queries than on the set of all queries, due to the particular division of training and testing queries. The comparison between standard algorithms' performance and those of diversification approaches on the testing queries raises similar observations as mentioned in the previous subsections 7.1 and 7.2.",null,null
,,,
145,"It can be seen that the classification approach provides the best performance over all metrics. It can be attributed to the fact that the learning based classification approach can harness the advantage of different algorithms, and combine them in an effective way. A typical example from our training set is the query ""Obama family tree"" with its provided subtopic ""Find the TIME magazine photo essay Barack Obama's Family Tree"". For ReDDE.top and CRCS, it is almost impossible to find a sample document containing all the keywords of the subtopic/aspect, if such a document does not exist in the sample database. On the other hand, Big Document and CORI can provide some useful hints for selecting sources by looking at all sample documents from each source as whole. For example, several different sample documents of a source may contain various parts of the query. This is particularly useful for sources that cover a wide range of topics, for instance, Wikipedia. Another example is the query ""Volvo"" with its provided subtopic ""Find a Volvo dealer"". Big Document and CORI can give hint to the sources that contain the words ""Volvo"" and ""dealer"" from different sample documents. For those sources, the classification approach can utilize the complementary results for improving search results diversification.",null,null

The first approach is based on sample documents, which ranks sample documents with respect to result diversification, and then",null,null

281,"utilizes the ReDDE framework for ranking the sources. The second approach is based on source-level estimation, which directly ranks each information source as a whole for result diversification. Furthermore, a learning based classification approach is proposed to combine multiple resource selection algorithms for more accurate diversification results.",null,null

282,"An intensive set of empirical studies has been conducted to evaluate the proposed research on the Clueweb federated search dataset. Both the approach based on sample documents and on source-level estimation can outperform traditional resource selection algorithms in result diversification in both source-level for resource selection and in the document-level for federated document retrieval. Moreover, the learning based approach, which combines outputs",null,null

285,"There are several possible directions to pursue in the future. The learning based method in this paper utilizes a simple model for combining outputs of multiple algorithms for result diversification, while a more sophisticated learning method may be more effective. Furthermore, it is an interesting topic to design new result merging algorithms with the focus on result diversification.",null,null
