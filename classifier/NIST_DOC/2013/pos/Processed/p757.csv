10,"Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms contain a large number of questions and associated answers. Answerers sometimes include URLs as part of the answers to provide further information. This paper describes a novel way of building a test collection for web search by exploiting the link information from this type of social media data. We propose to build the test collection by regarding CQA questions as queries and the associated linked web pages as relevant documents. To evaluate this approach, we collect approximately ten thousand CQA queries, whose answers contained links to ClueWeb09 documents after spam filtering. Experimental results using this collection show that the relative effectiveness between different retrieval models on the ClueWeb-CQA query set is consistent with that on the TREC Web Track query sets, confirming the reliability of our test collection. Further analysis shows that the large number of queries generated through this approach compensates for the sparse relevance judgments in determining significant differences.",null,null

21,"but this is not available for general use in academic environments. In this paper, we explore an approach to generating a set of queries and relevance judgments for a collection of web documents by exploiting the information in social media, and more specifically Community Question Answering services. CQA sites such as Yahoo! Answers1 and Baidu Zhidao2 provide social platforms for users to raise questions, to obtain useful information and to share potential answers. The collaborative nature of such platforms motivates interested users to voluntarily engage in providing useful answers to many topics. Answerers sometimes provide URLs as part of their answers. These links are used to provide additional information, to explain more complicated concepts that can not be detailed in short paragraphs, or to present reliable citations, etc. Figure 1 shows an example of an answer that incorporates several URLs.",null,null
22,"The central hypothesis of this paper is that these links can be regarded as relevant documents for the CQA question (or query). Although the relevance judgments obtained in this way are likely to be sparse, our expectation is that the large number of queries obtained will compensate for this.",null,null
23,"In this paper, we collected a large number of questionanswer pairs from existing and newly crawled CQA collections. We then reduced this set to include only questions whose answers contained links, where the links pointed to documents in the ClueWeb09 collection. The final ClueWebCQA (CW-CQA) set of queries and relevance judgments was produced after some additional filtering to deal with issues",null,null

Our CW-CQA results show that a term dependency model significantly outperforms a bag of words model, and pseudo-relevance feedback techniques can be helpful in most cases. These findings are consistent with the results using standard TREC Web Track query sets. As expected, the relevance judgments are sparse and incomplete. Carterette et al. [4] demonstrated that, up to a point, evaluation over more queries with fewer judgments is as reliable as fewer queries with more judgments. Similarly, we show that evaluating using a sufficient number of queries shows significant differences between retrieval models despite the incomplete relevance judgments.",null,null
27,The rest of paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 summarizes related work and Section 3 describes the methodology of building the CW-CQA test collection. We discuss the experimental results in Section 4. Section 5 makes closing remarks and discusses several future directions.,null,null
28,2. RELATED WORK,null,null
29,"There have been several web test collections created for supporting reproducible experiments at TREC. Examples include .GOV2, WT2g, and WT10g as well as a recent larger collection ClueWeb09. For large collections, relevance judging is mostly done through pooling techniques [7]. Such techniques assemble and judge results from multiple searches and systems, with the assumption that most relevant documents will be found.",null,null
30,"Even with the use of pooling methods, creating relevance judgments is often costly and the judged results can be biased and incomplete [2]. Buckley and Voorhees [1] proposed the metric bpref that is both highly correlated with existing measures when complete judgments are available and more robust to incomplete judgment sets. For the Million Query Track at TREC 2007, Carterette et al. [4] presented two document selection algorithms [3] to acquire relevance judgments. Their results suggested that, up to a point, evaluation over more queries with fewer judgments is more costeffective and as reliable as fewer queries with more judgments.",null,null

32,3.1 Test Collection,null,null
33,"We build the CW-CQA test collection using large CQA datasets and the web collection ClueWeb09 3. We obtain a large number of question-answer pairs from the CQA corpora and harvest all links provided in answers. We then reduce this set to include only questions whose answers contained links pointing to ClueWeb09 documents. We obseve that some of the links contained in CQA answers can be considered to be spam pages. To ensure a reliable test collection, we filter the reduced question sets based on two spamcontrolling parameters SR and SA. Cormack et al [5] proposed a content-based classifier that quantifies the ""spamminess"" of a document based on a scale of 0 to 100, where a lower score indicates that the page has a higher likelihood to be spam. Accordingly, SA calculates the average spam score of all links LQ extracted for a question Q and SR records",null,null

We dicuss the parameter settings in Section 4.",null,null
36,3.2 Retrieval Models,null,null
37,"We test four existing retrieval models including query likelihood model (QLM), relevance model (RM) [8], sequential dependency model (SDM) [9] and a query expansion model using latent concept expansion (LCE) [10]. We choose these models because they include both common baselines used in other papers and methods that are state-of-the-art in terms of effectiveness.",null,null

49,LCE is a robust query expansion technique based on MRFIR. This technique provides a mechanism for modeling term dependencies during expansion. The central idea is to compute a probability distribution over latent concepts using a set of pseudo-relevant documents in response to Q. Retrieval is then done by incorporating the top k latent concepts with the highest likelihood into original MRF model. Details of these models can be found in the appropriate papers.,null,null

RM can significantly improve QLM for most metrics, showing the utility of pseudo-relevance feedback. LCE seems to improve SDM, but the significant difference is only observed for metrics P@100 and bpref. In general, models SDM and LCE are the most effective compared to others.

The utility of pseudo-relevance feedback is more evident for desc queries.

[4] suggested that evaluation over more queries with fewer judgments can be reliable. Similarly, an interesting question from our perspective is: how many queries do we need to confirm the existence of significant differences between retrieval models? To this end, we compute the p-value between QLM and SDM using different number of CW-CQA queries. Specifically, from the 3k set, we randomly sample k queries where k ranges from 100 to 3400 in steps of 100. We perform 20 random samples at each k and report the average p-value in Figure 4. All metrics share a tendency that using more queries results in smaller p-values. For metrics such as MAP, MRR and P@10, stable significance (i.e., p-value < 0.05) is reached when the sample size grows beyond 2100. For other metrics such as P@100 and bpref, a sample size of more than 1000 queries is sufficient to confirm a significant difference. These observations support [4] in a sense that evaluating using a sufficient number of CW-CQA queries distinguishes retrieval model effectiveness despite incomplete judgments.",null,null
