5,"Clinical information retrieval (IR) presents several challenges including terminology mismatch and granularity mismatch. One of the main objectives in clinical IR is to fill the semantic gap among the queries and documents and go beyond keywords matching. To address these issues, in this paper we attempt to use semantic information to improve the performance of clinical IR systems by representing queries in an expressive and meaningful context. To model a query context initially we model and develop query domain ontology. The query domain ontology represents concepts closely related with query concepts. Query context represents concepts extracted from query domain ontology and weighted according to their semantic relatedness to query concept(s). The query context is then exploited in query expansion and patients' records re-ranking for improving clinical retrieval performance. We evaluate our approach on the TREC Medical Records dataset. Results show that our proposed approach significantly improves the retrieval performance compare to classic keyword-based IR model.",null,null

13,"Due to increasing volume of digitalized medical patient records, the need for advanced information retrieval systems increases. Digitalized medical patient records contain valuable information that are usually embedded in medical reports in the form of medical history, allergies, lab results, discharge summaries and progress notes. This makes it difficult for clinicians to rapidly and effectively access the desired records and the need for effective IR system arises.",null,null

16,"conceptual representation rather than simple keywords to enhance the representation of queries and documents. Modeling and developing domain ontologies is a fundamental framework for representing knowledge using a set of concepts and the relationships among the concepts. Medical domain knowledge is developed by several different ontologies including Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). The UMLS Metathesaurus contains millions of biomedical and health related concepts. This thesaurus is classified by concepts and connects each concept to its alternative names and views in other source vocabularies. It also determines appropriate relationships among concepts. The structural framework of UMLS ontologies aids us in categorizing concepts and locating related and similar concepts automatically. Achieving an IR model capable of exploiting semantics requires proper relatedness/similarity measures [6]. Semantic relatedness and semantic similarity in medical domain are useful measures for effective natural language processing, artificial intelligence and IR. Similarity measures determine how similar two concepts are by calculating how close they are in the UMLS semantic network hierarchy. Relatedness measures determine how related two concepts are by using concepts definition information.",null,null
,,,
17,"Clinical IR presents several specific challenges such as granularity mismatch [12] and terminology mismatch. In [12] authors tackle the issue of granularity mismatch by exploiting subsumption relationships extracted from medical domain knowledge resources, where subsumption relationships are defined as parentchild relationships when one concept is a subset of another concept. Keyword-based IR models could return imprecise and erroneous results due to their dependency on specific keywords. Concept-based representation approaches are intended to overcome this limitation by representing queries and documents with semantic concepts using biomedical resources such as UMLS. However previous work demonstrated that these approaches should be combined with term-based approaches for better performance [9]. In [5] authors tackle the issue of terminology mismatch by proposing a technique to represent queries with only medical concepts crucial to information need. In their method, they represent queries and documents using medical concepts that are directly related to symptoms, diagnosis, diagnosis test and treatment. One of the other challenges in medical IR is to retrieve those relevant documents that don't contain queries' concepts but contain concepts that are associated with them. For example a query may contain specific disease whereas the relevant document may contain symptoms of that disease. Our proposed approach attempts to address the presented challenges by modeling meaningful and expressive query context that represents the most related concepts to query concepts.",null,null

This model is capable of combining search by meaning and search by keyword and it uses a WordNet-based [6] semantic relatedness measure to calculate relatedness of pair of concepts. In this approach we develop query domain ontology for each query using the UMLS ontology. Concepts in the domain ontology are then weighted according to their relatedness to the original query concepts. Query context contains all the concepts in query domain ontology that have a related score above a specific threshold. The query context is used to enhance classical IR model and to calculate and assign a new score to documents by considering semantics. The key unique contributions in our paper concern (1) modeling query domain ontologies to extract representative concepts to information need and (2) modeling medical query context based on the modeled ontology and weight the concepts semantically in relation to the query according to a semantic-based concept weighting schema.,null,null

23,"Our approach attempts to enhance classical IR model by exploiting semantic relatedness to fulfill the objective of searching by meaning representation of content. To achieve this, we model a query context for each query, where each concept is weighted according to its relatedness to query concept(s). The query context is then exploited in the patient records query expansion and reranking for improving clinical retrieval performance.",null,null
,,,
24,"A prerequisite step for modeling a representative query context is modeling query domain ontology. In order to find the most qualified concepts representing query context we model and develop query domain ontology for each query using UMLS Metathesaurus. To develop query domain ontology, first we map query keywords to UMLS concepts using MetaMap [1]. MetaMap is a program developed by National Library of Medicine (NLM), which maps biomedical texts to the UMLS Metathesaurus. Second we extract all the concepts that have semantic relationship with the query concept(s) in UMLS ontologies. The Metathesaurus contains synonymous and non-synonymous relationships between concepts from the same source vocabulary as well as concepts in different vocabularies. In general, the relationships connect closely related concepts, such as those that share some common property or are related by definition. Semantic relationships can be of different types including SY (synonym), RB (broader relationship), RN (narrower relationship), SIB (sibling) etc. The main motivation for including synonymous and non-synonymous relationships for modeling query concepts domain ontology is to capture all the concepts closely related to the query concept(s). Concepts extraction is capped at second level to avoid concepts that are not in a close relation with query concepts. This ontology is capable of addressing the issue of granularity mismatch by including the parent-child relationship, where the child concept is a subset of the parent concept. This ontology is also capable of tackling the problem of retrieving those relevant documents not containing queries' keywords explicitly but containing concepts semantically related to the queries, since it includes alternative names and views of the same concept as well as concepts that are closely related to the query concept(s).",null,null

27,"The query context of each query consists of all the concepts in their modeled domain ontology. In order to identify the extent of a concept relevancy in relation with query concept we weight each concept in query domain ontology according to its semantic relatedness to the query concept. For the purpose of this study we use Gloss Vector semantic [8] relatedness measure. This choice relies on the fact that this measure relies on concepts definitions information rather than semantic network hierarchy; therefore it is able to calculate semantic relatedness of pair of concepts in different UMLS ontologies. This measure represents concepts by vectors of co- occurrences. Co- occurrences refer to words that commonly occur close to each other in a corpus of text. This measure calculates relatedness of pair of concepts by combining the structure and content of WordNet with co-occurrence information. The value of semantic relatedness indicates the relatedness of pair of concepts, the higher the value the higher the semantic relatedness. The semantic relatedness of pair of concepts is between 0 and 1, the value is 1 if two concepts are identical and 0 if they are not related.",null,null
