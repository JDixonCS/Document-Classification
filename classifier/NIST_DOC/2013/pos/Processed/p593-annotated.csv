6,"Prior search result diversification work focuses on achieving topical variety in a ranked list, typically equally across all aspects. In this paper, we diversify with sentiments according to an explicit bias. We want to allow users to switch the result perspective to better grasp the polarity of opinionated content, such as during a literature review. For this, we first infer the prior sentiment bias inherent in a controversial topic ­ the `Topic Sentiment'. Then, we utilize this information in 3 different ways to diversify results according to various sentiment biases: (1) Equal diversification to achieve a balanced and unbiased representation of all sentiments on the topic; (2) Diversification towards the Topic Sentiment, in which the actual sentiment bias in the topic is mirrored to emphasize the general perception of the topic; (3) Diversification against the Topic Sentiment, in which documents about the `minority' or outlying sentiment(s) are boosted and those with the popular sentiment are demoted.",null,null

7,"Since sentiment classification is an essential tool for this task, we experiment by gradually degrading the accuracy of a perfect classifier down to 40%, and show which diversification approaches prove most stable in this setting. The results reveal that the proportionality-based methods and our SCSF model, considering sentiment strength and frequency in the diversified list, yield the highest gains. Further, in case the Topic Sentiment cannot be reliably estimated, we show how performance is affected by equal diversification when actually an emphasis either towards or against the Topic Sentiment is desired: in the former case, an average of 6.48% is lost across all evaluation measures, whereas in the latter case this is 16.23%, confirming that bias-specific sentiment diversification is crucial.",null,null

12,1. INTRODUCTION,null,null
,,,
13,"In previous work diversification has mainly been applied for better topical variety in search results [9, 25, 26, 27]. Equal preference is typically given to all aspects. How can opinionated content exhibiting sentiments be diversified? Initial approaches have been presented [10, 17, 18]; however these only consider equal diversification. In this paper, we view the problem from a high-level perspective to allow for sentiment diversification according to different biases, which will be vital for situations like a literature review on a controversial topic.",null,null
,,,
14,"Consider the topic `global warming.' In a typical use case, a user engages in a comprehensive literature review with the aim of understanding the positions on this topic. This involves ­ besides searching and finding relevant opinionated documents [16] ­ understanding and mentally categorizing opinionated content. This can be done by organizing the discussed arguments by topical content; or, they can also be grouped by sentiment, such as positive, negative, neutral, and mixed [18]. We focus on facilitating the latter approach for the user. For some topics that can clearly be generalized into `pro' versus `con' arguments, this sentiment categorization is more natural, whereas it can be less obvious for topics like global warming that are associated with various arguments. Focusing on the sentiment dimension of these arguments, we can see that negative sentiments for global warming typically express criticism and concern about it and its effects on the environment. Those with positive sentiment often claim that worries about global climate change are unjustified (""there is no such issue""), playing down the concerns in a `calming' (i.e., positive) way. Mixed or neutral statements either express no sentiments or contain an equal amount of positive and negative arguments. Those could be ""I don't care"", or ""It's a serious problem but we're handling it"" kind of stances towards global warming.",null,null
,,,
15,"Getting back to our use case: while a balanced and unbiased presentation of the results helps the user understand various viewpoints on a topic, discerning the topic's polarity is harder if minority opinions are `buried' in the results [18]. Therefore, the user should be able to switch the result perspective as needed. This way, she can either obtain a balanced or a biased view on majority or minority opinions, make her own comparisons across the representations, and perform this task in a more informed manner. Note that this is different from showing all positive or all negative or all neutral/mixed documents at a time: with such a representation the user would still need to draw her own conclusions about which sentiments form majority or minority",null,null

22,"opinions. Our aim is to analyze this information for the user and to match the inferred trend as closely as possible in the results. For this, we need to have a good grasp of the topic a priori: we consider a large pool of relevant documents about the topic, which are grouped by sentiments as visualized in Figure 1. Then, we can infer the topic's sentiment distribution or inherent bias ­ Topic Sentiment ­ from this analysis. We categorize the aspects `mixed' and `neutral' together to represent the `balanced' aspect, whereas `positive' and `negative' refer to arguments that are clearly biased towards one side only. If Figure 1 represented the Topic Sentiment for global warming, this could be interpreted as the issue being perceived with great concern since negative sentiments constitute the majority, and while there are some `balanced' positions on it, the positive sentiments form a clear minority. By utilizing this information during diversification, three biases are emphasized in search results: (1) Equal diversification by preferring all sentiments equally. This allows for a balanced representation of all sentiments on the topic; (2) Diversification towards the Topic Sentiment, in which the resulting reranked list mirrors the actual sentiment bias in a topic. This approach highlights the general perception of a topic; (3) Diversification against the Topic Sentiment, in which documents about the minority sentiment(s) are boosted whereas those with the majority sentiment are demoted. Such a list highlights unusual and outlying opinions on the topic.",null,null

23,"In this paper we propose different diversification models for sentiment diversity with these 3 biases, and perform experiments using the TREC Blog Track data [23].

Further, in case the Topic Sentiment cannot be reliably estimated, we show how performance is affected by equal diversification when actually an emphasis either towards or against the Topic Sentiment is desired. The results reveal that particularly when highlighting minority sentiments, diversifying with the corresponding bias yields significant improvements.",null,null

24,2. RELATED WORK,null,null

25,There is a large amount of work in the area of topical diversity: the main aim is to eliminate topical redundancy,null,null
,,,
26,"in results while maximizing the number of documents containing novel information [1, 3, 6, 9, 25, 26, 27]. One of the earliest works is the maximal marginal relevance (MMR) approach [3], which employs content-based similarity measures to balance the tradeoff between novelty and relevance. More recently, researchers have shown explicit diversification approaches to be superior over implicit diversification techniques: well-known algorithms are xQuAD [25, 26, 27], IAselect [1], and more recently PM-1 and PM-2 [9]. Other approaches to topical diversity are language modeling based [31], probabilistic [4] and correlation-based [30]. Very recent research addresses personalized diversification [29], blog feed diversity [19, 28], and combined implicit and explicit aspect diversification [15].",null,null
,,,
27,"Among these approaches, it is common to equally or uniformly diversify across all query aspects or subtopics due to the lack of data [9, 25, 26, 27]. Although the TREC Web Track diversity task provides topical query aspects [8], distributions over these aspects are not included. Agrawal et al. [1] use their own classifiers and judgments for obtaining query intent aspect distributions. Further, the NTCIR-9 Intent task provides non-uniform aspect probabilities [24]. One of our contributions in this paper is to present alternatives to the equal distribution approach (Section 3.4): a query's topic's sentiment distribution can be employed in various ways to yield an emphasis for a certain bias. Topical diversity could also benefit from these ideas.",null,null
,,,
28,"The proportionality-based approaches PM-1 and PM-2 [9] distinguish themselves from prior research by explicitly matching the aspect distribution in the diversified list to the overall popularity of these aspects, thus yielding a proportionally diversified list. We adapt this approach to sentiment diversity, and propose a minor variation for dealing with retrieval limitations (Section 3.3).",null,null
,,,
29,"Extensive work on opinion detection and retrieval has dealt with techniques to boost opinionated documents in retrieval [14, 28, 32, 33]. Prior work focusing on opinion diversity is very recent: Demartini and Siersdorfer describe a study about opinions in search results as given by popular search engines for controversial queries [11]. In later work, Demartini then tackles opinion diversification [10]: his approach is based on the xQuAD framework [25]. Retrieved search results are classified into the sentiment categories positive, negative, or objective. Diversification ensures maximum variety among these aspects with uniform preference. We implement this approach as the SCS model and combine it with the 3 biases (Section 3.2.1). The SCSF model is a further extension, presented in Section 3.2.2.",null,null
,,,
30,"Kacimi and Gamper propose a different opinion diversification framework for controversial queries [17, 18]: three criteria are considered for diversification: topical relevance, semantic diversification, and sentiment diversification. Their model favors documents most different in sentiment direction and in the arguments they discuss. The sentiments are again one of positive, negative, and neutral. In the model the components are linearly combined; however, in order to find the documents maximizing the distances for all criteria the authors consider all subsets of documents. Our work differs from this work in several points: (1) We perform sentiment diversification only and not opinion diversification. Opinions refer to topical content, whereas sentiments are a non-topical aspect that we focus on in this paper. (2) This choice allows us to study sentiment diversification perfor-",null,null

33,"In this context, unlike topical diversity we make a simplifying assumption that each query belongs to one topic and therefore represents one topical aspect. We avoid dealing with ambiguity by using long and specific queries in our experiments, as explained in Section 4. That is, the topical dimension is kept static so we can focus on the varied sentiment dimension. We leave it to future work to explore the interplay of topical and sentiment aspects together for diversification.",null,null

35,3.1 Introduction,null,null
,,,
36,"In order to diversify a retrieved list with respect to the distribution of sentiments in a query's topic, we need to introduce a few concepts first. Let Q be a query, and let T be the query's topic T (Q), abbreviated as T for simplicity. As visualized in Figure 1, we define T to include all the relevant documents that can be retrieved for Q, i.e., T ,"" rel(Q). Further, let each document D in T have a sentiment, i.e., each document is positive, negative, neutral or mixed. These can be generalized to countable sentiment criteria   sent(T ). We will use this sentiment information from T in our models to diversify search results according to the distribution of sentiments in the topic.""",null,null
,,,
37,"Sentiment criteria of the form positive, negative, and neutral/mixed can take different shapes when converted into a sentiment score. In the literature [10, 17, 23] we identified a document to either have a single discrete sentiment from {-1, 0, 1}, or the sentiment is broken down into three scores positivity, negativity, and neutrality such that they sum to 1.0 for a single document. We refer to these latter ones as finer grained ""fractional scores"" in the rest of the paper. Our models are designed for these kinds of scores, but discrete scores can also be handled by simple conversion as we will show later.",null,null

If documents are manually judged, they are often associated with only one `dominant' sentiment score from {-1, 0, 1} such as -1, which can be converted into a 100% negative score.

Unless the system requests more documents, the desired proportionality in the diversified list may not be optimally achieved with the current set of documents. In this situation, with respect to PM-2 the given votes v overestimate l, the actual number of documents with sentiment  in the retrieved top K set. For a large enough rank K, this may result in a suboptimally diversified list where documents with an over-emphasized sentiment are exploited early in the ranks.

Then, for each  at rank i we swap its estimation P (|T ) with the one at rank n - i. This `reverses' the values in the topic distribution without changing the properties of the distribution. Consequently, if originally in T positive documents are strongly favored and negative documents are least favored, this trend is reversed through the value swap in T so that outlying sentiments (negative documents) will be strongly preferred during diversification. We refer to this bias as `Outlier' (OTL) in the experiments (Section 4).",null,null

We experimented with both approaches but only present the results for (1) here due to space limitations: we use the relevance judgments from the TREC 2008 Blog Track [23], which are divided into the same sentiment aspects as required in the models.",null,null

In order to measure sentiment diversity with a chosen bias, we implement all the measures in their intent-aware (or for us, `sentiment-aware') version [1, 2].

,,,
211,"Our primary aim in the experiments is to evaluate sentiment diversification performance. Sentiment classification is an important part of the system since both the to-bediversified documents need to be tagged with sentiments, as well as those for the topic sentiment distribution estimation. Since a `full evaluation' of sentiment diversification techniques on a publicly available dataset has not been done yet in prior work, it is important to understand how sentiment classification quality affects diversification performance. Therefore, we start with a ""perfect system"" in which classification accuracy is 100% for judged documents. For unjudged documents the trained sentiment classifier described in Section 4.1 is applied. We then gradually reduce the overall classification performance in 10% steps until 40% as follows: given the top K ,"" 50 retrieved documents for a query, before diversification we randomly sample the ranks at which the true classification label is switched to another label randomly to achieve the desired classification error for each query.""",null,null

212,"Figure 2 shows the results for the straight-bias experiment, in which the topic sentiment distribution employed in experiment and evaluation underlies the same favored bias. For instance, the left-most column in Figure 2 shows the results for diversifying towards Crowd in the experiments, and measuring performance for Crowd in the evaluation (shortCRD-CRD). The middle column shows the same for Balance (short: BAL-BAL), and the right-most column is for the Outlier bias (short: OTL-OTL).",null,null

213,"At the top-most row in the Precision-IA@20 graphs we observe a big gap between the SDM baseline and SCS model versus the rest of the models. For Crowd, the SCSF model only dominates when classification accuracy is at least 60% while it achieves the best (however not statistically significant) numbers in the Outlier graph. PM-2M and PM-2 also perform well and dominate some of the lower accuracy ranges. Statistical significance with the paired two-sided ttest (p-value< 0.05) is indicated in the graphs with circles:",null,null

590,"Among the s-recall@20 graphs the one for Crowd is the most arbitrary one. Performance drops well below the baseline for the SCSF and proportionality-based methods with medium quality classification: this indicates that the majority sentiment(s) are being emphasized too strongly, whereas minority sentiments appear much later in the ranked list for the first time, which is when the subtopic-recall measure is affected. This is expected, since we explicitly diversify in favor of majority sentiments. In the Balance and Outlier graphs for s-recall@20 there is no such trend, however precision is not as high for those biases as it is for Crowd. This is a typical precision versus recall tradeoff observation.",null,null
,,,
591,"The next row shows results for -NDCG@20, followed by ERR-IA@20 and NRBP: we note that the trends in these graphs look very similar, although the ranges of the values differ greatly. It is interesting to observe that the peak performance for the proportionality-based methods for the Crowd bias is not at 100% classification accuracy, but at 90%. What these three measures have in common is punishing redundancy based on the rank and sentiment criterion in addition to non-relevance. Since usually there are many documents with the majority sentiment in the retrieved list to start with, a strong emphasis on a single sentiment criterion results in more redundancy. With the 10% error in classification documents with other sentiments are slightly boosted, yielding better overall varied ranking. In the Balance and Outlier graphs this trend cannot be observed, since the Balance bias does not strongly emphasize a single sentiment criterion to begin with. Concerning the Outlier bias, there are fewer documents with minority sentiments in the retrieved list to cause the same `clustered' ranking effect as for Crowd. Summarizing the trends across the -NDCG@20, ERR-IA@20, and NRBP graphs we make the following conclusion: if ranking is important, the PM-2 and PM-2M methods should be chosen.",null,null
,,,
592,"Finally, we look at the last row of graphs with the CPR@20 results: this measure evaluates how proportional the overall list is with respect to the chosen bias. PM-2 and PM-2M achieve the best results, which is closely followed by SCSF. PM-2 and SCSF are more appropriate for lower classification accuracies ( 70%), whereas PM-2M performs slightly better with better classification quality.",null,null
,,,
593,"Looking at the fixed values of the interpolation parameter  during training for this experiment, the following insights",null,null
,,,
594,"can be drawn: for the SCS model, across all classifier accuracies and biases generally   0.6 values are preferred. So this model performs best with a weaker emphasis on diversity, which pulls it closer to the SDM baseline as observed in the graphs of Figure 2. SCSF on the other hand has a good mixture of higher and lower  values across classifier accuracies and biases, with many of them being < 0.5, particularly when the classifier is more accurate. So a heavier emphasis on the diversification part helps this model. The distinguishing feature between SCS and SCSF is the consideration of sentiment frequencies in addition to sentiment strength contributions. When the classifier is noisy however (< 60%) and thus sentiment frequency counts are not accurate, SCSF also benefits from higher  values. In the PM-2 and PM-2M models the role of  is different: it balances the emphasis on the chosen aspect  versus all the other aspects   sent(T ),  ,"" . Here, consistently higher  values are preferred for both models, i.e., a high emphasis on the chosen aspect and a minimal weight on the other ones seems most beneficial. The effectiveness of these two models solely relies on sentiment estimations: given our adaption of PM-2 from its original definition ([9]) to sentiment diversity, the retrieval scores are not used for building the diversified list.""",null,null

596,"Consider the following real-world setting: for certain topics, it may not be feasible to collect data for calculating Topic Sentiment estimations, or suitable corpora may currently not be available. This could happen if the topic is very new and the data is not substantial enough for drawing general conclusions. If judgments shall be obtained, the data tagging effort may also be a burden. In such a situation we can fall back to the Balance bias or equal diversification approach [9, 25, 26, 27]. Naturally, the next question to answer is how much performance is lost when diversifying with Balance instead of the desired bias such as Outlier. The cross-bias experiments in this section investigate this case, and enable us to draw conclusions about the value of collecting and using information about topic sentiment distributions for controversial topics.",null,null

642,"or characteristic excerpts from the documents together with their overall sentiment. The topic of this query has the following Topic Sentiment: 67% negative, 17% mixed/neutral, and 16% positive. Here we diversify for the Crowd Bias, so the aim is to mirror this distribution in the results. The top 10 retrieved results with the SDM baseline are presented at the top left: this result list does not include any positive documents, and an equal amount of negative and mixed/neutral documents, which is clearly unsatisfactory for a Crowd bias representation of the results. The SCS model includes one positive document at rank 3, since lower ranked documents through the SDM baseline can be pulled up by the diversification models. Although the documents are nicely shuffled around across ranks, the ratio of the sentiments is still not close to the Topic Sentiment. The SCSF model is able to correct this, explicitly considering the frequency of documents with their dominant sentiments: we have 6 negative documents, 3 mixed/neutral, and 1 positive. But 4 negative documents are clustered right after each other, which slightly affects measures such as -NDCG@10. The PM-2 results (bottom right) use the overall proportionality of the sentiments in the list as a guidance for choosing further documents: here, a second positive document is pulled up from lower ranks, yielding the best CPR@10 score among the 4 models for this query at a cost of slightly lower Precision-IA@10 than SCSF. With 5 negative documents, 3 mixed/neutral ones, and 2 positive documents we are very close to the desired distribution of sentiments.",null,null

,,,
645,"In this paper we demonstrate how to diversify search results according to sentiments by considering a pre-defined bias. This allows us to emphasize either majority or minority sentiments during diversification, or to give an unbiased representation across all sentiment aspects. For this, we introduce several diversification models that use sentiments and topic sentiment distributions. Diversifying the output of a strong retrieval baseline, the results on the TREC Blog Track data reveal that the proportionality-based methods and the SCSF model perform best according to most measures, but an individual choice should be made based on the quality of the sentiment classifier at hand. Finally, we demonstrate the value of using biases and collecting topic sentiment distribution estimations by means of cross-bias experiments in which equal diversification is performed instead of the desired bias.",Y,null
,,,
646,"The ideas presented in this paper are not only valuable for sentiment diversity, but can also be applied to topical diversity with modifications. To what extent does it make sense to consider biases for topical diversity? For instance, with an Outlier bias-like approach underrepresented query aspects could be highlighted in search results. Further, we have proposed different extensions to existing diversification models such as xQuAD and PM-2 with the SCSF and PM2M models, which may be effective for topical diversity as well.",null,null
,,,
647,"There are many directions for future work: (1) Exploring other biases applicable for sentiment diversity; (2) We found that our trained 3-class sentiment classifier and ready-to-use classifiers on the web perform rather poorly at documentlevel sentiment classification. State-of-the-art sentiment classification works better on sentences or short text, but interpreting the overall sentiment of a document is more difficult, particularly on the web. Therefore, advances in this area would greatly benefit sentiment diversification so that it can be applied to the web beyond the TREC Blog Track; (3) In case this is difficult to realize, how can the diversification models be adapted to yield higher gains with noisy classification input; (3) Analyzing opinion or topical arguments and sentiments together with biases. One question to solve is what kind of biases could be defined to capture both, and whether more fine-grained topic-specific biases would be required.",Y,null
