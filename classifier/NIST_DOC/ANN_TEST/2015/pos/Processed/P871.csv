4,ABSTRACT,null,null
5,"The quantum probabilistic framework has recently been applied to Information Retrieval (IR). A representative is the Quantum Language Model (QLM), which is developed for the ad-hoc retrieval with single queries and has achieved significant improvements over traditional language models. In QLM, a density matrix, defined on the quantum probabilistic space, is estimated as a representation of user's search intention with respect to a specific query. However, QLM is unable to capture the dynamics of user's information need in query history. This limitation restricts its further application on the dynamic search tasks, e.g., session search. In this paper, we propose a Session-based Quantum Language Model (SQLM) that deals with multi-query session search task. In SQLM, a transformation model of density matrices is proposed to model the evolution of user's information need in response to the user's interaction with search engine, by incorporating features extracted from both positive feedback (clicked documents) and negative feedback (skipped documents). Extensive experiments conducted on TREC 2013 and 2014 session track data demonstrate the effectiveness of SQLM in comparison with the classic QLM.",null,null

14,"of van Rijsbergen [8], which draws a clear connection between the QT and IR. Piwowarski et al. [5] proposed that queries and documents can be modeled as density operators and subspaces respectively, but the tensor space based representation method has not led to good performance. The advent of Quantum Language Model (QLM) [7] , a representative QT-based IR model, successfully solved this issue. In QLM, both single terms and compound term dependencies are represented as projectors in a vector space, while queries and documents are represented as density matrices defining a quantum probability distribution in the space. An EMbased training method for the estimation of density matrix is then devised [7]. The advantages of QLM over traditional language models have been demonstrated from both theoretical and experimental perspectives.",null,null
15,"Despite its success in the ad-hoc retrieval, QLM (referred to as classical QLM in the rest of the paper) is solely targeted on single ad-hoc queries. It is insufficient to capture the dynamics of users' information need in response to the user's interaction with the search engine. As a result, it is difficult for the classical QLM to be applied in more complex search tasks, such as multi-query session search.",null,null
16,"To address this challenge, we propose to integrate user' short-term interaction information into the estimation of QLM for the current query, and correspondingly a novel Session-based QLM (SQLM) is proposed. The evolution of the user's information need within a search session is modeled by the density matrix transformation, i.e., transforming the original density matrices (for single queries) by some principled rules based on user interactions (e.g., the click and dwell time). We also put forward the concepts of positive projectors and negative projectors extracted from the positive feedback documents (clicked documents) and negative feedback documents (skipped documents), respectively, to enhance the representation ability of the QLM. Specially, a novel training algorithm for QLM with different projectors is devised. Although there exists a body of related work [3][9] for integrating users' interaction information in IR models, they did not model term dependencies in queries and documents, compared with the SQLM proposed in this paper.",null,null

41,"The classical Quantum Language Model(QLM) aims at modeling term dependencies in the principled quantum theory formulation. Different from traditional language models, QLM extracts term dependencies in each document as projectors in the quantum probabilistic space. The single words correspond to projectors |ei ei|, and the compound terms (with two or more words for each term) correspond to projectors |v v| (refer to Section 2.1). The projectors are used to estimate density matrices q and d for a query and each document by maximizing a likelihood function with the EMbased iterative approach, i.e., RR algorithm [7]. Then, the top retrieved documents in the initial search results returned by the traditional language model are re-ranked according to the negative VN-Divergence between q and d.

66,"In session search, we assume that there exists an ""ideal"" transformation T for density matrices which can model dynamic query intention in the historical interactions. Specifically, T is a transformation that for any two consecutive queries qi-1 and qi, the estimated density matrix ^i,"" T i-1 represents the user's information need for qi, where i-1 is a representation of qi-1. This implies we further make a 1st order Markov assumption that a query is dependent solely on its last previous query. This assumption is reasonable because the dependency can continuously back-propagate in the session.""",null,null
67,"Theoretically, from Eq.(1), we can easily find that T can be divided into two separate transformation process: T ,"" T1T2. T1 is the transformation operator for quantum events |ui . Since |ui forms an orthogonal basis, T1 can be any standard transition matrix. T2 changes the original probability distribution for the events (namely, change the values of i), and it is be a diagonal matrix. In this sense, the transformation of density matrix is basically a transformation of main quantum events, and a reallocation of quantum probability for each event.""",null,null
68,"In practice, however, this consideration seems infeasible due to its high degree of freedom. Suppose a vocabulary V with |V| distinct words, T1 will have a freedom of O(|V|2), and T2 will have a freedom of O(|V|). Thus the model is prone to be overfiting and computationally expensive. Moreover, it is hard to draw a clear and reasonable connection from the training of T1 and T2 to the extraction of projectors. Therefore, we propose an iterative training approach to represent the transformation process, inspired by the updating method of the classical QLM. Specially in this paper, we use the density matrix i-1 for query qi-1 as the initial density matrix to train the density matrix i for query qi.",null,null

251,"In this paper, we present a novel quantum theory based probabilistic framework for multi-query retrieval task, i.e., session search. By extending the classical Quantum Language Model (QLM), our proposed Session-based Quantum Language Model (SQLM) incorporates the sound mechanism of the density matrix transformation to approximate the dynamics of information need entailed in historical interactions, for re-ranking the initial results generated by the search engine. At the operational level, we utilise the information from both clicked documents and top unclicked documents, and devise a new training algorithm. Extensive experiments on both TREC 2013 and 2014 Session track datasets demonstrate that SQLM does perform better than classical QLM for multi-query retrieval systems, and also show its potential of being further improved for session search.",null,null
252,"Therefore, it is safe and reasonable to conclude that the proposed Session-based Quantum Language Model(SQLM) is a feasible expansion of classical Quantum Language Model(QLM) on the multi-query session search tasks. As for future work, we believe that a better retrieval result could be achieved if one can find a better realization of density matrix transformation based on the quantum inference, and incorporate more features into the framework. We will also apply the model to data closer to real-time retrieval systems.",null,null
