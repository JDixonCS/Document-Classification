8,"Modelling term dependence in IR aims to identify co-occurring terms that are too heavily dependent on each other to be treated as a bag of words, and to adapt the indexing and ranking accordingly. Dependent terms are predominantly identified using lexical frequency statistics, assuming that (a) if terms co-occur often enough in some corpus, they are semantically dependent; (b) the more often they co-occur, the more semantically dependent they are. This assumption is not always correct: the frequency of co-occurring terms can be separate from the strength of their semantic dependence. E.g. red tape might be overall less frequent than tape measure in some corpus, but this does not mean that red+tape are less dependent than tape+measure. This is especially the case for non-compositional phrases, i.e. phrases whose meaning cannot be composed from the individual meanings of their terms (such as the phrase red tape meaning bureaucracy).",null,null
9,"Motivated by this lack of distinction between the frequency and strength of term dependence in IR, we present a principled approach for handling term dependence in queries, using both lexical frequency and semantic evidence. We focus on non-compositional phrases, extending a recent unsupervised model for their detection [21] to IR. Our approach, integrated into ranking using Markov Random Fields [31], yields effectiveness gains over competitive TREC baselines, showing that there is still room for improvement in the very well-studied area of term dependence in IR.",null,null

23,1. INTRODUCTION,null,null
24,"Frege's principle of compositionality posits that the meaning of an expression is a function of the meanings of its constituent expressions and the ways they combine [59]. Applied to linguistics by Montague, this principle implies that the meaning of some text is not just the collective meaning of its words, but also a function of how these words are arranged. Whereas this holds most of the times, occasionally language is non-compositional, i.e. the meaning and arrangement of words alone is not enough to convey the overall semantics. E.g. the phrase red tape (meaning bureaucracy) is not a tape of type red. This linguistic phenomenon is known as non-compositionality.",null,null
25,"The challenges posed by non-compositionality have spurred Natural Language Processing (NLP) research in automatic non-compositionality detection, e.g. in nouns [1, 47], verb-noun [20] and verb-particle [30] combinations, using techniques such as latent semantic analysis [20], compositional translations to multiple languages [44], sense induction [22] and word space models [23, 42]. An active line of research focuses on distributional and vector-based models of word and phrase meaning leading to vector-space models for compositionality [8, 35, 41]. These advances have not penetrated IR research notably (with the exception of [33], discussed in Section 2), despite long and persistent IR interest in term dependence. A resulting risk is that the strength of term dependence may be consistently miscalculated in IR. We explain this next.",null,null
26,"In IR, dependent terms are predominantly identified using lexical frequency statistics: if terms co-occur often enough in some typically large dataset, they are assumed to be dependent, and the strength of their dependence is typically assumed proportional to their frequency of co-occurrence, e.g. see [10, 34]. Simply stated, the more frequently two terms co-occur, the more dependent we assume they are. This assumption is not always correct. In linguistics, the frequency of term co-occurrence can be somewhat separate from the strength of semantic dependence. Even though the former can be indicative to some extent of the latter, their relation is not symmetric. E.g. red tape might be overall less frequent than tape measure in some corpus, but this does not",null,null

28,"mean that red+tape are semantically less dependent than tape+measure; quite the contrary. Non-compositionality lies at the heart of this because non-compositional terms are maximally dependent, regardless of their frequency of co-occurrence. So, whereas the strength of term dependence within compositional phrases, e.g., tape measure, white horse, can be reasonably approximated by their frequency of co-occurrence in a corpus, this is not true for non-compositional phrases, like red tape, dark horse.",null,null
29,"Motivated by this lack of distinction in IR between frequency of term co-occurrence and strength of term dependence, we present a principled approach for treating term dependence in queries. This approach extends a recent unsupervised model for detecting non-compositional phrases using lexical frequency and semantic evidence [21]. The main idea consists of (a) substituting a term in a phrase by a synonym (e.g. red tape would become scarlet tape) and (b) measuring the semantic divergence of the replacement phrase from the original phrase. If their meanings diverge, the original phrase is more likely to be non-compositional. If however their meanings do not diverge much (e.g. tax office would become tax bureau), then the original phrase is less likely to be non-compositional. We extend the vector space model proposed for measuring this divergence in [21] with a probabilistic model that measures the KullbackLeibler divergence between the language models of the original and replacement phrase (Sections 3-4). We apply both approaches to detect strongly dependent query terms, which we then treat in a non-bag of words fashion during ranking (Section 6). Experiments with 350 TREC queries show that our approaches consistently outperform competitive baselines, and are particularly effective for 2-, 3-, and 4-term queries in the web search task.",null,null
30,2. RELATED WORK,null,null
31,"Broadly speaking, efforts to model term dependence, also known as term co-occurrence, adjacency and lexical affinities1 in IR, typically model phrases found in queries and/or documents, motivated by the intuition to consider as more relevant those documents in which terms appear in the same order and patterns as they appear in the query, and as less relevant those documents in which terms are separated [51]. These efforts were initiated mainly in the 1980s, and intensified in the 1990s, reporting retrieval benefits. Later, efforts decreased: baseline performance improved, and the cost associated with linguistic processing was not worth the small benefits over the already improved baselines [54].",null,null
32,"Generally, term dependence is detected using either statistical or linguistic information. Research began with the early work on statistical term associations [6, 14, 24, 56] and syntax-based approaches [3, 7, 45], continuing with work on probabilistic term dependence models [15, 46, 60, 61, 63], syntactic methods [5, 32, 49, 50] and statistical approaches [10, 25, 26]. From the mid-1990s onwards, research focused on hybrid methods combining syntactic and statistical approaches of phrase processing [9], phrase-based enhancement of the indexed term representations [64], and phrase-based term weighting [37, 39, 57]. More recent research has focused on statistical methods, primarily using language modelling",null,null

34,"[31, 34, 36, 52, 55] but not exclusively [28, 40], while attention has also been given to term dependence and efficient large-scale indexing [12, 27]. The Markov Random Field (MRF) model of term dependence [31] reported significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.",null,null
35,"Several more recent studies address term dependence, for instance using heuristics [58], formalising the term position in the document [29], or extending the MRF model to concepts [4], all reporting positive findings. This continued interest in term dependence may indicate that it is still an open problem. However, to our knowledge, none of these approaches addresses non-compositionality, except Michelbacher et al. [33], who focus primarily on the automatic detection of the head modifier inside non-compositional phrases and use IR as a task illustrating that the information they detect can be useful. They experiment with a small nonTREC dataset and report statistically significant gains in retrieval precision.",null,null
36,3. NON-COMPOSITIONALITY DETECTION (NCD),null,null
37,"Non-Compositionality Detection (NCD) aims to identify the presence and strength of non-compositional phrases in language. This is typically realised as a measurement, i.e. through some function that outputs a compositionality score for a phrase. Given a scale of such scores, the minimum and maximum reflect the total absence of compositionality (noncompositionality), e.g. red tape, and complete compositionality, e.g. tax office, respectively. Sliding along such a scale corresponds to moving across phrases of various levels of compositionality, practically facilitating the comparison of phrases on the grounds of their term dependence. We reason that such a comparison may be useful to IR, where systems need to process differently queries at different positions of this scale, i.e. keyword-based (,"" compositional) queries such as London transportation, and queries containing heavily dependent terms ("",non-compositional) such as red tape AL register car.",null,null
38,"This section presents how we use non-compositionality to model term dependence in IR. Among the various NCD approaches outlined in Section 1, we use the recent approach of [21] because it is unsupervised, resource-efficient, and performs competitively on benchmark tests. We extend this NCD approach, which uses vector spaces, by adding a second estimation of non-compositionality, this time probabilistic. In addition, we formally express the methodological description of [21] as a model of query perturbation, and we model non-compositional term dependence specifically for IR queries, not general phrases like [21], with considerations to data constraints in an IR context.",null,null
39,3.1 Non-compositionality in queries,null,null
40,"Given a query, we aim to detect the presence and strength of non-compositionality in it. Kiela and Clark [21] posit that non-compositional phrases can be identified by substituting each of the original words in them, one at a time, by some other relevant/synonymous term, and comparing the meaning of each phrase resulting from the substitution to the meaning of the original phrase. The more they diverge, the less compositional the original phrase is. E.g. replacing car by vehicle in import car gives import vehicle, which is semantically similar to the original, but replacing red by",null,null

42,"scarlet in red tape gives scarlet tape, which is semantically different from the original. Hence, red tape is less compositional than import car. The core idea is that such substitutions are likely to have a low impact on the semantics of compositional phrases, but a high impact on the semantics of non-compositional phrases. The resulting semantic divergence is then approximately inversely proportional to compositionality.",null,null
43,"Conceptually, we see this approach as applying perturbations over some signal in order to study the resulting effects upon the signal. In our case, the signal is the query and the perturbation is the replacement of a query term by another term. We express this perturbation as follows: Let Sq(I; T ) be the semantic space S of query q containing the ordered set of terms T , where I is the information conveyed by T . Let T¯ denote the ordered set of query terms where one of them has been replaced by another term (e.g., a synonym). I.e., T¯ is the perturbation of T . Then, the non-compositionality Nq, and the compositionality Cq of query q, can be expressed as a function of the divergence  of the resulting semantic spaces (Sq(I; T ), Sq(I; T¯)), for all m , |T | divergences resulting from all substitutions:",null,null

48,"Unless constrained, such perturbations risk drifting semantically further away than intended, e.g., if two out of all three terms in a query are replaced simultaneously. Kiela & Clarke address this using two constraints, which we also adopt: (a) only one term is replaced at a time, and (b) a term is replaced by its synonym or a closely related term such as a hyper- or hyponym2.

A selection process must control the perturbations so that: (a) ""best possible"" synonyms (as opposed to near-synonyms) are used, and (b) the number of perturbations is minimised, i.e. we perturb the queries no more than necessary for computing their compositionality. We thus use one perturbation per query term and experimentally show (in Section 6) that this suffices for IR. Other tasks, including NCD per se, may require more perturbations per term.",null,null

74,"We now present our probabilistic representation of queries and their perturbations. The high-level difference from the previous representation is that instead of representing a query as a vector of terms, we represent it as a distribution of events, where the events correspond to terms. Such representations are called probabilistic because they allow computing the probability of an event occurring, i.e. the probability of a term occurring in the query. When these probabilities are interpreted in a frequentist way, they are approximated by relative frequencies (i.e. normalised word counts). In text processing, this is known as language modelling.",null,null

E.g., if n,""5, then we consider 11 terms in total: 5 (immediately preceeding t) + t + 5 (immediately succeeding t). The underlying assumption is that all the terms in a document have some relationship to all other terms in the document, modulo window size, outside of which the relationship is not taken into consideration.

Another effect of pointwise multiplication is that the frequency of terms occurring in the context windows of a query term will be strengthened: if a term t has a high weight in both v(t) and v(t ), it will have a high weight in v(t) v(t ); however, low weight in either one of v(t) or v(t ) will correspond to low weight in v(t) v(t ).

Our use of semantic divergence, measured typically as a real number in the model, corresponds to the observation that compositionality is not dichotomous: phrases in general are not only compositional or non-compositional; rather, a fine-grained range of compositionality exists, a fact corroborated by human raters asked to score degrees of compositionality [2, 30]. Suitable divergence functions that could mimic the scores of human raters may exist, but we have not attempted to do so.",null,null
180,"We have also not attempted to estimate the semantic `accuracy' of the phrases resulting from each perturbation, i.e. the extent to which they are non-sensical, even though Kiela & Clarke state that this is possible with their approach [21]. We estimate solely the divergence between the query and a perturbation, and not how much sense the perturbed phrase makes, for two reasons: (a) we reason that the semantic divergence should in principle suffice for indicating compositionality as we intend to use it in IR; (b) to our knowledge, no scalable automatic approach can adequately approximate such a semantic assessment for query logs.",null,null
181,"Another point of departure from Kiela & Clarke is our treatment of query terms as a list, i.e. a set endowed with a strict order. In principle, all computations presented, both by Kiela & Clarke and by us, can be used with ordinary (i.e., unordered) sets of terms too, as has also been done with term dependence models in IR [31]. We use strictly ordered sets because non-compositionality is never manifested in language in any other way, for instance by mixing the order of non-compositional terms, or by interrupting them by another term. E.g., red tape can function non-compositonally (and mean bureaucracy) only when the terms red and tape appear adjacent and in that specific order. Ergo, no variation of red .+ tape or tape .+ red (in RegEx notation) can have the non-compositional meaning of bureaucracy.",null,null
182,"Finally, perturbations are common in science, and the practice of perturbing queries has even been used in IR before, albeit for different reasons. For instance Vinay et al. [62] employ different query (and document) perturbations for query performance prediction: by altering the query term weights, they observe the documents retrieved, and study the relationship between the amount, or sensitivity of perturbation and the quality of the ranking. Our approach, apart from having a different overall scope, namely term dependence as opposed to query performance prediction, also differs from [62] in that it applies a linguistically informed selection process for each perturbation: we replace query terms by their synonyms, not by varying their respective term weights within some range.",null,null

188,"We use the non-compositionality score of each query (computed with any of the 5 vector space or 8 language modelling variants presented in Section 4) as a proxy of term dependence. This allows to detect queries more likely to be noncompositional, hence more likely to contain highly dependent terms, rather than those queries that are strictly noncompositional. We do this by ranking queries by their noncompositionality and selecting the  least compositional. These  queries are processed with the MRF model of fully dependent query terms; the rest of the queries in the batch are treated as a bag of words.",null,null

191,"We use three baselines: (1) bag of words for all queries, which allows for no term dependence; (2) the MRF model of sequentially dependent query terms [31], which treats as a `set phrase' only adjacent query terms; (3) the MRF model of fully dependent query terms [31], which treats as a `set phrase' the whole query. We compare these baselines against our selective term dependence approach that treats as a `set phrase' the whole query iff the NCD score of this query indicates that it is likely to be non-compositional; this is controlled by the threshold  presented above.",null,null
192,"All three baselines and our 13 NCD variants use a unigram, query likelihood, Dirichlet-smoothed language model for ranking. Note that we use `language model' in two different ways in this work, for two entirely different computations: (a) to estimate the semantic divergence between queries and perturbations (in Section 3.2.2), and (b) to rank documents with respect to queries.",null,null

194,"We use the TREC 6-8 queries (301-450, title only) of the AdHoc track with Disks 4-5 (minus the Congressional Records for TREC7-8), and queries 1-200 of the Web AdHoc tracks of TREC 2009-2012 with ClueWeb09B4 (see Table 1). We extract the distributional semantics of the NCD model (i.e. build the context windows) from Disks4-5 for queries 301-450, and from ClueWeb09B for queries 1-200. We use no stemming and remove stop words from the queries only (as in [31]). We use Indri 5.85 for indexing and retrieval of at most 1000 documents per query. We evaluate retrieval effectiveness using standard measures of early and deep precision (MAP, NDCG@10, P@10).",null,null

We also vary the number  of least compositional queries selected each time:   1 . . . 45 per TREC batch of 50 queries. All tuning is done per evaluation measure using 3-fold cross validation.

210,"Table 3 shows the retrieval precision of our baselines and NCD approaches. Each cell also displays the % of queries that are treated as a `set phrase'. For the MRF models, 100% means that all queries are treated as a `set phrase', including single-term queries, for which this treatment makes no difference over a bag of words treatment. Overall, our NCD approaches outperform all baselines at all times. The improvement over the strongest baseline is modest (up to >+3.5% for MAP with ATC, >+3.3% for NDCG@10 with MI, and >+4.5% for P@10 with MI), however it is consistent for both datasets and for all evaluation measures (deep and early precision). This means that the performance gain spans across the range of relevant documents (those retrieved in the top ranks, but also those retrieved further down). Unlike earlier findings that the use of co-occurrence information tends to reduce retrieval effectiveness [46], possibly due to the fact that the term relationships modelled may have little discriminating power [31], we notice an overall modest but clear gain in effectiveness.",null,null
211,"Breaking this down to a per-query basis (cf. the two top plots in Fig. 1), the following two findings emerge. (I) The scale of improvement is higher than that of deterioration: between +0.13 and -0.07 for MAP; and between +0.68 and -0.4 for NDCG@10, for our Laplace sum approach (chosen illustritatively) from the strongest baseline (MRF with full dependence). (II) More queries improve than deteriorate by our approach. Hence, the improvements in Table 3 are not artificially inflated by outliers that might affect the means of the evaluation measures, but are rather representative of the whole body of queries.",null,null
212,"Furthermore, we show examples of queries yielding the highest and lowest precision difference from the strongest baseline in Table 5. The best queries are not strictly noncompositional; however they do have strongly contextualised semantics and term co-dependence. E.g. french lick resort casino does not denote some other meaning than a particular casino, but it is presumably irrelevant to the semantics of the verb to lick and french as a language or nationality. Most of the best queries in Table 5 are web queries, which often tend to include abbreviations and acronyms, e.g. vbart sf. These are not non-compositional either, but rather idiomatic or colloquial phrases of strong term dependence, and are selected by our NCD approach because they are likely to diverge in meaning if perturbed (i.e. it is not possible to express their meaning alternatively, for instance by near-synonyms). Hence, using NCD to approximate strong term dependence is effective in these",null,null

E.g. tv show, television programme/broadcast, signs/symptoms/indications heart attack/failure, etc. Restricting this type of queries to strict `set phrase' matching limits the retrieval scope significantly with resulting drops in performance.",null,null
529,Next we focus the analysis on two pertinent aspects of our approach: the number of strongly term dependent queries selected and retrieval performance for 2-4 term queries.,null,null
530,6.3.1 Number of least compositional queries,null,null
531,"The number of queries treated as a `set phrase' is lower for our approach than for MRF by 1/3 for Disks4-5 and 2/3 for ClueWeb09B, or by 1/4 for Disks4-5 and 1/3 for ClueWeb09B if we ignore 1-term queries (statistics in Table 2). Compositionality and term dependence in general cannot be measured for single terms, hence 1-term queries are ignored.",null,null
532,"Since we treat the number  of least compositional queries as a tuneable parameter, one may wonder to what extent the gains we report are due to tuning as opposed to the inherent strength of our approach in detecting term dependence. To answer this, Fig. 2 shows the MAP and NDCG@10 of our MI approach across the range of  values for ClueWeb09B (we can confirm similar trends for P@10 and Disks4-5, and our other NCD approaches). We see that our approach outperforms the strongest baseline (marked by a horizontal line) consistently across the range of , peaking when roughly  ,""80 least compositional queries (out of 200, or 143 if one excludes 1-term queries) are treated as strongly term dependent. Practically this means that our approach can be used without necessarily tuning  and is likely not to give large fluctuations in both early and deep precision.""",null,null
533,6.3.2 Queries of 2-4 terms,null,null
534,"Finally, we focus on queries of 2, 3 and 4 terms because these are the most likely to include strong term dependence, hence they are ideal for comparing our approaches to the MRF models.",null,null
535,"Table 4 shows the retrieval precision of our baselines and our three best NCD approaches (marked by * in Table 3) specifically for queries of these lengths. Again all our approaches outperform all baselines at all times. The only exception is for 4-term queries in Disks4-5 and P@10, where our methods perform equally to the strongest baseline (no gain, no loss). Overall, our NCD approaches outperform the strongest baseline by up to >+5% for MAP, >+6% for NDCG@10, and >+8% for P@10, on average. The two middle and lower plots in Fig. 1 show that these improvements are not due to outliers, but are instead spread over the queries. Fig. 1 illustrates this for 2- and 3-term queries w.r.t. MAP and NDCG@10, but we confirm that the same trend applies to 4-term queries and P@10. Hence, for queries of length 2-4, i.e. predominantly phrasal queries, our approaches outperform all baselines notably. This finding, combined with the relative robustness of the threshold  discussed above, mean that our approach could be used as part of the IR pipeline, e.g. for 80% of the incoming queries of length 2-4. Note that these types of queries form the majority of all queries, at least in our TREC data (see Table 2), hence they are not a negligible sample.",null,null

578,"The relative gains in retrieval precision reported above should not be considered as indications of accurate noncompositionality detection. The suitability of our proposed probabilistic representation of queries and their perturbations in particular remains to be evaluated for NCD accuracy. Moreover, several of our choices of NCD settings can be further explored, e.g. synonymy selection or smoothing choices. In this initial study we opted for default or popular settings, where possible. For these reasons, we have refrained from making a quantitative comparison between the vector space and probability space NCD variations, other than reporting the retrieval precision they yield. This means that the NCD variations we present are not necessarily calibrated to this domain or task. Calibrating them could potentially improve performance even more, but would incur some computational cost, the major bulk of which would likely lie in the extraction of context windows from some large dataset. In an IR scenario, this can be done offline, and is perhaps not too distant from the query analytics widely used.",null,null
579,"Regarding our data, the query sets we use are `curated' by TREC, in the sense that those queries that are perhaps not understood by human assessors, or for which no relevant documents are easily found during pooling, may have been omitted. This selection may have affected non- or lowcompositionality queries. This agrees with the finding that the number of IR benchmark queries that contain strongly dependent terms in general is small [65]. Unfiltered query logs may contain more such queries, making our approach potentially even more useful in such a practical setting.",null,null
580,8. CONCLUSIONS,null,null
581,"We presented an approach for detecting strongly dependent query terms using the linguistic property of non-compositionality. Non-compositional meaning cannot be induced from the meanings of individual words or their arrangement in a query. E.g., hot dog is not a type of dog that is hot, but rather a type of food. We used unsupervised measurement of non-compositionality to approximate the detection of strongly dependent query terms. Such queries are challenging to IR because they cannot be processed to some reasonable accuracy by bag of words approaches. Motivated by this, we focussed not on how these queries can be treated during ranking (there is a lot of literature in this area generally for term dependence, which can be applied here), but on how these queries can be selected from a batch or stream of incoming queries. This specific question has so far been addressed by assuming that the more frequently terms co-occur in a query, the more dependent they are. This assumption is however not always true, because frequency is not always proportional to the strength of semantic association. The unsupervised method for measuring non-compositionality that we used is recent and uses vector spaces [21]. We extended it by adding a probabilistic representation that uses Kullback-Leibler divergence. We experimentally showed that all variants of our approach were effective in selecting which queries to treat as term dependent and resulted in gains for both early and deep precision (> 5%) with respect to a range of baselines (standard bag of words and competitive MRF with sequential and full dependence [31]).",null,null
582,"In the future we plan to analyse the amount of non- or low-compositionality queries in real-life query logs, as opposed to TREC data. As discussed in Section 7, there may be more low-compositionality queries in those samples. We also intend to investigate optimal ways of measuring noncompositionality within a query, as opposed to considering the non-compositionality of a query as a whole as we did here. Another interesting direction is the direct mapping of the non-compositionality score of a query into the strength of its term dependence used during ranking. In this initial study we treated all queries selected as least-compositional in the same way as fixed phrases processing them identically; in doing so, we ignored their grades of non-compositionality. Modelling this may yield further improvements and is an interesting research question in its own right.",null,null
