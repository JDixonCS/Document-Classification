12,ABSTRACT,null,null
13,"e design and presentation of a Search Engine Results Page (SERP) has been subject to much research. With many contemporary aspects of the SERP now under scrutiny, work still remains in investigating more traditional SERP components, such as the result summary. Prior studies have examined a variety of di erent aspects of result summaries, but in this paper we investigate the in uence of result summary length on search behaviour, performance and user experience. To this end, we designed and conducted a withinsubjects experiment using the TREC AQUAINT news collection with 53 participants. Using Kullback-Leibler distance as a measure of information gain, we examined result summaries of di erent lengths and selected four conditions where the change in information gain was the greatest: (i) title only; (ii) title plus one snippet; (iii) title plus two snippets; and (iv) title plus four snippets. Findings show that participants broadly preferred longer result summaries, as they were perceived to be more informative. However, their performance in terms of correctly identifying relevant documents was similar across all four conditions. Furthermore, while the participants felt that longer summaries were more informative, empirical observations suggest otherwise; while participants were more likely to click on relevant items given longer summaries, they also were more likely to click on non-relevant items. is shows that longer is not necessarily be er, though participants perceived that to be the case ­ and second, they reveal a positive relationship between the length and informativeness of summaries and their a ractiveness (i.e. clickthrough rates). ese ndings show that there are tensions between perception and performance when designing result summaries that need to be taken into account.",null,null

18,1 INTRODUCTION,null,null
19,"Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) is a complex, non-trivial process where a searcher undertakes a variety of di erent actions during a search session [16]. Core to their experience and success is the Search Engine Results Page (SERP), with its presentation and design over the years having been subject to much research. With more complex components now becoming commonplace in modern day Web search engines (such as the information card [5, 36] or social annotations [35]), much work however still remains on examining how more traditional SERP components (such as result summaries) are designed and presented to end users.",null,null
20,"Result summaries have traditionally been viewed as the `ten blue links' with the corresponding URL of the associated document, and one or more textual snippets of keywords-in-context from the document itself, approximately 130-150 characters (or two lines) in length [15]. Numerous researchers have explored result summaries in a variety of di erent ways, such as: examining their length [11, 19, 38]; the use of thumbnails [47, 52]; their a ractiveness [9, 14]; and the generation of query-biased snippets [41, 48].",null,null
21,"e performance of users has broadly been evaluated in a limited fashion (e.g. by examining task completion times). In this work, we are interested in how the length and information content of result summaries a ects SERP interactions and a user's ability to select relevant over non-relevant items. Prior research has demonstrated that longer result summaries tend to lower completion times for informational tasks (where users need to nd one relevant document) [11], but does this hold in other contexts, speci cally for ad-hoc retrieval, where users need to nd several relevant items? Furthermore, how does the length and information associated with longer result summaries a ect the user's ability to discern the relevant from the non-relevant?",null,null
22,"is work therefore serves as an investigation into the e ects of search behaviour and search performance when we vary (i) result summary snippet lengths, and by doing so (ii) the information content within the summaries. To this end, a within-subjects crowdsourced experiment (n ,"" 53) was designed and conducted. Under ad-hoc topic retrieval, participants used four di erent search interfaces, each with a di erent size of result summary. Findings allow us to address the two main research questions of this study. RQ1 How does the value of information gain represented as snippet length a ect behaviour, performance and user experience? RQ2 Does information gain ­ again represented as snippet length ­ affect the decision making ability and accuracy (identifying relevant documents) of users? We hypothesise that longer and more informative snippets will enable users to make be er quality decisions (i.e. higher degrees of accurately identifying relevant content).""",null,null

26,2 RELATED WORK,null,null
27,"As previously mentioned, the design and presentation of SERPs has been examined in depth. Researchers have examined various aspects of SERPs, and how the designs of such aspects in uence the behaviour of users. Here, we provide a summary of the various aspects that have been investigated. Speci cally, we focus upon: the layout of SERPs; the size of SERPs; how snippet text is generated; and how much text should be presented within each result summary ­ the la er being the main focus of this work.",null,null
28,2.1 SERP Layouts and Presentation,null,null
29,"Early works regarding the presentation of result summaries [6, 12] examined approaches to automatically categorise result summaries for users, similar to the categorisation approach employed by early search engines. Chen and Dumais [6] developed an experimental system that automatically categorised result summaries on-the- y as they were generated. For a query, associated categories were then listed as verticals, with associated document titles provided underneath each category header. Traditional result summaries were then made available when hovering over a document title. Subjects of a user study found the interface easier to use than the traditional `ten blue links' approach - they were 50% faster at nding information displayed in categories. is work was then extended by Dumais et al. [12], where they explored the use of hover text to present additional details about search results based upon user interaction. Searching was found to be slower with hover text, perhaps due to the fact that explicit decisions about when to seek additional information (or not to) were required.",null,null
30,"Alternatives to the traditional, linear list of result summaries have also been trialled (like grid-based layouts [8, 20, 40]). For example, Krammerer and Beinhaur [20] examined di erences in user behaviour when interacting with a standard list interface, compared against a tabular interface (title, snippet and URL stacked horizontally in three columns for each result), and a grid-based layout (result summaries placed in three columns). Users of the grid layout spent more time examining result summaries. e approach demonstrated promise in overcoming issues such as position bias [10], as observed by Joachims et al. [17].",null,null
31,"Marcos et al. [34] performed an eye-tracking user study examining the e ect of user behaviour while interacting with SERPs ­ and whether the richness of result summaries provided on a SERP (i.e. result summaries enriched with metadata from corresponding pages) impacted upon the user's search experience. Enriched summaries were found to help capture a user's a ention. Including both textual and visual representations of a document when presenting results could have a positive e ect on relevance assessment and query reformulation [18]. Enriched summaries were also examined by Ali et al. [2] in the context of navigational tasks. Striking a good balance between textual and visual cues were shown to be er support user tasks, and search completion time.",null,null
32,2.2 Generating Snippet Text,null,null
33,"Users can be provided with an insight by result summaries as to whether a document is likely to be relevant or not [14]. Consequently, research has gone into examining di erent kinds of snippets, and how long a snippet should be. Work initially focused",null,null
34,"upon how these summaries should be generated [30, 31, 39, 48, 51]. ese early works proposed the idea of summarising documents",null,null
35,"with respect to the query (query-biased summaries) or keywords-incontext ­ as opposed to simply extracting the representative or lead sentences from the document [29]. Tombros and Sanderson [48] showed that subjects of their study were likely to identify relevant documents more accurately when using query-biased summaries, compared to summaries simply generated from the rst few sentences of a given document. ery-biased summaries have also been recently shown to be preferred on mobile devices [45].",null,null
36,"When constructing snippets using query-biased summaries, Rose et al. [41] found that a user's perceptions of the result's quality were in uenced by the snippets. If snippets contained truncated sentences or many fragmented sentences (text choppiness), users perceived the quality of the results more negatively, regardless of length. Kanungo and Orr [21] found that poor readability also impacts upon how the resultant snippets are perceived. ey maintain that readability is a crucial presentation a ribute that needs to be considered when generating a query-biased summary. Clarke et al. [9] analysed thousands of pairs of snippets where result A appeared before result B, but result B received more clicks than result A. As an example, they found results with snippets which were very short (or missing entirely) had fewer query terms, were not as readable, and a racted fewer clicks. is led to the formulation of several heuristics relating to document surrogate features, designed to emphasise the relationship between the associated page and generated snippet. Heuristics included: (i) ensuring that all query terms in the generated snippet (where possible); (ii) withholding the repeating of query terms in the snippet if they were present in the page's title; and (iii) displaying (shortened) readable URLs.",null,null
37,"Recent work has examined the generation of snippets from more complex angles ­ from manipulating underlying indexes [4, 49] to language modelling [14, 32], as well as using user search data to improve the generation process [1, 42]. Previous generation approaches also may not consider what parts of a document searchers actually nd useful. Ageev et al. [1] incorporated into a new model post-click searcher behaviour data, such as mouse cursor movements and scrolling over documents, producing behaviour-biased snippets. Results showed a marked improvement over a strong text-based snippet generation baseline. Temporal aspects have also been considered ­ Svore et al. [46] conducted a user study, showing that users preferred snippet text with trending content in snippets when searching for trending queries, but not so for general queries.",null,null
38,2.3 Results per Page,null,null
39,"Today, a multitude of devices are capable of accessing the World Wide Web (WWW) ­ along with a multitude of di erent screen resolutions and aspect ratios. e question of how many result summaries should be displayed per page ­ or results per page (RPP) ­ therefore becomes hugely important, yet increasingly di cult to answer. Examining behavioural e ects on mobile devices when interacting with SERPs has a racted much research as of late (e.g. [24­ 26]), and with each device capable of displaying a di erent number of results above-the-fold, recent research has shown that the RPP value can in uence the behaviour of searchers [17, 25]. Understanding this behaviour can help guide and inform those charged with designing contemporary user interfaces.",null,null

43,"In a Google industry report, Linden [33] however stated that users desired more than 10RPP, despite the fact that increasing the RPP yielded a 20% drop in tra c; it was hypothesised that this was due to the extra time required to dispatch the longer SERPs. is drop however be a ributed to other reasons. Oulasvirta et al. [37] discusses the paradox of choice [43] in the context of search, where more options (results) ­ particularly if highly relevant ­ will lead to poorer choice and degrade user satisfaction. In terms of user satisfaction, modern search engines can therefore be a victim of their own success, presenting users with choice overload. Oulasvirta et al. [37] found that presenting users with a six-item search result list was associated with higher degrees of satisfaction, con dence with choices and perceived carefulness than an a list of 24 items.",null,null
44,"Kelly and Azzopardi [22] broadly agreed with the ndings by Oulasvirta et al. [37]. Here, the authors conducted a betweensubjects study with three conditions, where subjects were assigned to one of three interfaces - the baseline interface, showing 10RPP (the `ten blue links'), and two interfaces displaying 3RPP and 6RPP respectively. eir ndings showed that individuals using the 3RPP and 6RPP interfaces spent signi cantly longer examining top-ranking results and were more likely to click on higher ranked documents than those on the 10RPP interface. Findings also suggested that subjects using the interfaces showing fewer RPP found it comparatively easier to nd relevant content than those using the 10RPP interface. However, no signi cant di erence was found between the number of relevant items found across the interfaces. Currently, 10RPP is still considered the de-facto standard [15].",null,null
45,2.4 Snippet Lengths: Longer or Shorter?,null,null
46,"Snippet lengths have been examined in a variety of ways. A user study by Paek et al. [38] compared a user's preference and usability against three di erent interfaces for displaying result summaries. With question answering tasks, the interfaces: displayed a normal SERP (i.e. a two line snippet for each summary, with a clickable link); an instant interface, where an expanded snippet was displayed upon clicking it; and a dynamic interface, where hovering the cursor would trigger the expanded snippet. e instant view was shown to allow users to complete the given tasks in less time than the normal baseline, with half of participants preferring this approach.",null,null
47,"Seminal work by Cutrell and Guan [11] explored the e ect of di erent snippet lengths (short: 1 line, medium: 2-3 lines; and long: 6-7 lines). ey found that longer snippets signi cantly improved performance for informational tasks (e.g. `Find the address for Newark Airport.'). Users performed be er for informational queries as snippet length increased. is work was followed up by Kaisser et al. [19]. ey conducted two experiments that estimated the preferred snippet length according to answer type (e.g. nding a person, time, or place), and comparing the results of the preferred snippet lengths to users' preferences to see if this could be predicted.",null,null
48,"e preferred snippet length was shown to depend upon the type of answer expected, with greater user satisfaction shown for the snippet length predicted by their technique.",null,null
49,"More contemporary work has begun to examine what snippet sizes are appropriate for mobile devices. Given smaller screen sizes, this is important ­ snippet text considered acceptable on a computer screen may involve considerable scrolling/swiping on",null,null
50,"a smaller screen. Kim et al. [27] found that subjects using longer snippets on mobile devices exhibited longer search times and similar search accuracy under informational tasks1. Longer reading times and frequent scrolling/swiping (with more viewport movements) were exhibited. Longer snippets did not therefore appear to be very useful on a small screen ­ an instant or dynamic snippet approach (as per Paek et al. [38]) may be useful for mobile search, too.",null,null
51,"e presentation of result summaries has a strong e ect on the ability of a user to judge relevancy [14]. Relevant documents may be overlooked due to uninformative summaries ­ but conversely, non-relevant documents may be examined due to a misleading summary. However, longer summaries also increase the examination cost, so there is likely a trade-o between informativeness/accuracy and length/cost. e current, widely accepted standard for result summaries are two query-based snippets/lines [15]. is work examines whether increasing and decreasing the length (and consequently the informativeness) of result summary snippets a ects user accuracy and costs of relevance decisions in the context of ad-hoc topic search, where multiple relevant documents are sought.",null,null

53,"To address our two key research questions outlined in Section 1, we conducted a within-subjects experiment. is allowed us to explore the in uence of snippet length and snippet informativeness on search behaviours, performance and user experience.

Figure 1 plots the number of words, the information gain, and the information gain per word2. It is clear from the plot that a higher level of information gain was present in longer snippets. However, as the length increases with each additional snippet fragment added, the informativeness per word decreased.

Despite these issues, it has been shown that there is li le di erence in the quality between crowdsourced and lab-based studies [54]. Nevertheless, quality control is a major component of a well-executed crowdsourced experiment [5]. Here, we detail our subjects and precautions taken.",null,null

375,"Figure 5: Plots, showing a variety of measures and survey results from subjects across the four interfaces examined. From le to right: actions associated with the subjects' search behaviours and performance; probabilities of interaction; and post-task survey responses, using a seven-point Likert scale (7 - strongly agree to 1 - strongly disagree).",null,null
376,"of experience, subjects broadly preferred longer summaries. e participants felt that longer summaries were more clear, informative, readable ­ and interestingly ­ gave them more con dence in their relevance decisions. With respect to RQ2, we again observed li le di erence in subjects' decision making abilities and accuracy between the four interfaces. While subjects perceived longer snippets to help them infer relevance more accurately, our empirical evidence shows otherwise. In fact, it would appear that longer result summaries were more a ractive, increasing the information scent of the SERP [53]. is may account for the increase in clicks on the early results, without the bene ts, however: accuracy of our subjects did not improve with longer snippets; nor did they nd more relevant documents. Increased con dence in the result summaries (from T0  T4) may have led to a more relaxed approach at marking content as relevant ­ as can be seen by increasing click and mark probabilities for both relevant and non-relevant content. It is also possible that the paradox of choice [37] could play a role in shaping a user's preferences. For example, in the condition with longer result summaries (T4), users viewed fewer results/choices than on other conditions. is may have contributed to their feelings of greater satisfaction and increased con dence in their decisions.",null,null
377,"ese novel ndings provide new insights into how users interact with result summaries in terms of their experiences and search behaviours. Previous work had only focused upon task completion times and accuracy of the rst result while not considering their experiences (e.g. [11, 19]). Furthermore, these past works were performed in the context of Web search where the goal was to nd one document. However, we acknowledge that our work also has limitations. Here, we examined out research questions ­ with respect to topic search within a news collection ­ to explore how behaviour and performance changes when searching for multiple relevant documents. It would be interesting to examine this in other search contexts, such as product search, for example. News article titles also can be cra ed di erently from documents in other domains. Summaries in this domain may perhaps be more important than in other domains, and so the e ects and in uences are likely to be larger. Furthermore, we only considered how behaviours changed on the desktop, rather than on other devices where users are more likely to be sensitive to such changes (e.g. [25, 27]). For example, during casual leisure search, multiple relevant documents on tablet devices are o en found, and so it would be interesting to perform a follow up study in this area.",null,null
