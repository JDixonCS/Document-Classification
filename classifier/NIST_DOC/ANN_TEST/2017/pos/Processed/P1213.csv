6,"Although information retrieval models based on Markov Random Fields (MRF), such as Sequential Dependence Model and Weighted Sequential Dependence Model (WSDM), have been shown to outperform bag-of-words probabilistic and language modeling retrieval models by taking into account term dependencies, it is not known how to e ectively account for term dependencies in query expansion methods based on pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) for retrieval models of this type. In this paper, we propose Semantic Weighted Dependence Model (SWDM), a PRF based query expansion method for WSDM, which utilizes distributed low-dimensional word representations (i.e., word embeddings). Our method nds the closest unigrams to each query term in the embedding space and top retrieved documents and directly incorporates them into the retrieval function of WSDM. Experiments on TREC datasets indicate statistically signi cant improvement of SWDM over stateof-the-art MRF retrieval models, PRF methods for MRF retrieval models and embedding based query expansion methods for bagof-words retrieval models.",null,null

11,1 INTRODUCTION,null,null
12,"Designing retrieval models and addressing the problem of vocabulary mismatch via query and document expansion have traditionally been two orthogonal directions of information retrieval (IR) research. In particular, separate methods for query [4] or document [3] expansion are typically employed in conjunction with bag-of-words probabilistic, such as BM25 [15], and language modeling based, such as ery Likelihood [14], retrieval models. ese methods typically identify query expansion terms in the collection itself using statistical measures of semantic similarity between pairs of terms pre-computed in advance [2, 9], top-retrieved documents [11], external resources [10] or their combination [1].",null,null

16,"Markov Random Fields (MRF) retrieval models [12], such as Sequential Dependence Model (SDM) and Weighted Sequential Dependence Model (WSDM), consider retrieval function as a graph of dependencies between the query terms and a document and calculate document retrieval score as a linear combination of the potential functions de ned on the cliques in this graph. Although these retrieval models have been shown to outperform probabilistic and language modeling retrieval models by going beyond bagof-words assumption and taking into account term dependencies, it is not known how to e ectively incorporate term dependencies into query expansion methods based on pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) for this type of retrieval models. Due to sparsity of n-grams, accounting for term dependencies in query expansion based only on term co-occurrence statistics within the collection itself is quite challenging. For this reason, only unigrams have been utilized for query expansion in Latent Concept Expansion (LCE) [13] and Parameterized ery Expansion (PQE) [6], state-ofthe-art PRF methods for SDM and WSDM, respectively.",null,null
17,"Word embeddings are distributed low-dimensional vector representations, which have been successfully utilized in di erent IR contexts, such as estimation of translation models [3, 21] and query expansion for bag-of-words retrieval models [19], as well as in retrieval models based on neural architectures [7, 16] and proximity search [8]. Since n-grams typically appear in a limited number of contexts in a collection, the utility of n-gram embeddings for IR is limited. For example, based on the word embeddings trained on a Google News corpus with 100 billion words1, the most semantically similar words to ""human"" are ""humankind"", ""mankind"" and ""humanity"", all of which can be good query expansion terms.",null,null
18,"e most semantically similar n-grams to ""human"", however, are ""human beings"", ""impertinent amboyant endearingly"", ""employee Laura Althouse"", and ""Christine Gaugler head""2. It is obvious that these n-grams would only cause topic dri and degrade the retrieval results, if used for query expansion. Furthermore, due to sparsity, bigram embeddings are also ine ective for computing their importance weight in SDM [20].",null,null
19,"Our proposed model, Semantic Weighted Dependence Model (SWDM), mitigates the potential vocabulary mismatch between queries and documents in WSDM via query expansion. Similar to SDM and WSDM, the retrieval score of a document, according to SWDM, depends on the matching query unigrams, ordered and unordered bigrams. However, unlike SDM, SWDM nds the closest unigrams and bigrams to query terms in embedding space and directly incorporates them into the retrieval function of WSDM.",null,null

24,"To overcome the n-gram sparsity problem, SWDM takes into account only the dependencies between those pairs of terms, in which at least one term is semantically similar to one of the query terms and both terms have appeared within multiple windows in the collection and top retrieved documents. For example, for the query ""human smuggling"", SWDM identi es ""tra cking"" as one of the expansion unigrams and ""human tra cking"" as one of the expansion bigrams, since the unigram ""tra cking"" is semantically similar to ""smuggling"". Proximity to query terms in the embedding space as well as their frequency in the collection and top-retrieved documents are used as features for weighting the importance of original and expansion concepts (unigrams or bigrams).",null,null

Components of a di erence vector between embeddings of query unigrams and embeddings of the entire query have been utilized as features to estimate the weights of query unigrams in SDM [20]. Relevance of documents to queries can be quanti ed by aggregating cosine similarity scores between pairs of the most similar query and document term embedding vectors [8]. An alternative approach to quantifying relevance of documents to queries involves aggregating the embeddings of all document and query words into a single embedding vector for the entire document and a single embedding vector for the entire query and calculating their relevance score as a cosine similarity between these vectors [17].",null,null
