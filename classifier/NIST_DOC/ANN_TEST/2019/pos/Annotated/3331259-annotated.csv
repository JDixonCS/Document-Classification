19,"Statistical signi cance testing is widely accepted as a means to assess how well a di erence in e ectiveness re ects an actual di erence between systems, as opposed to random noise because of the selection of topics. According to recent surveys on SIGIR, CIKM, ECIR and TOIS papers, the t-test is the most popular choice among IR researchers. However, previous work has suggested computer intensive tests like the bootstrap or the permutation test, based mainly on theoretical arguments. On empirical grounds, others have suggested non-parametric alternatives such as the Wilcoxon test. Indeed, the question of which tests we should use has accompanied IR and related elds for decades now. Previous theoretical studies on this matter were limited in that we know that test assumptions are not met in IR experiments, and empirical studies were limited in that we do not have the necessary control over the null hypotheses to compute actual Type I and Type II error rates under realistic conditions. Therefore, not only is it unclear which test to use, but also how much trust we should put in them. In contrast to past studies, in this paper we employ a recent simulation methodology from TREC data to go around these limitations. Our study comprises over 500 million p-values computed for a range of tests, systems, e ectiveness measures, topic set sizes and e ect sizes, and for both the 2-tail and 1-tail cases. Having such a large supply of IR evaluation data with full knowledge of the null hypotheses, we are nally in a position to evaluate how well statistical signi cance tests really behave with IR data, and make sound recommendations for practitioners.",Y,TREC

,,,
28,"In a recent survey of 1,055 SIGIR and TOIS papers, Sakai [27] reported that signi cance testing is increasingly popular in our eld, with about 75% of papers currently following one way of testing or another. In a similar study of 5,792 SIGIR, CIKM and ECIR papers, Carterette [5] also observed an increasing trend with about 60% of full papers and 40% of short papers using signi cance testing. The most typical situation is that in which two IR systems are compared on the same collection, for which a paired test is in order to control for topic di culty. According to their results, the t-test is the most popular with about 65% of the papers, followed by the Wilcoxon test in about 25% of them, and to a lesser extent by the sign, bootstrap-based and permutation tests.",null,null
,,,
29,"It appears as if our community has made a de facto choice for the t and Wilcoxon tests. Notwithstanding, the issue of statistical testing in IR has been extensively debated in the past, with roughly three main periods re ecting our understanding and practice at the time. In the 1990s and before, signi cance testing was not very popular in our eld, and the discussion largely involved theoretical considerations of classical parametric and non-parametric tests, such as the t-test, Wilcoxon test and sign test [16, 40]. During the late 1990s and the 2000s, empirical studies became to be published, and suggestions were made to move towards resampling tests based on the bootstrap or permutation tests, while at the same time advocating for the simplicity of the t-test [31­33, 46]. Lastly, the 2010s witnessed the wide adoption of statistical testing by our community, while at the same time it embarked in a long-pending discussion about statistical practice at large [3, 4, 26].",null,null

40,"The question we ask in this paper is: which is the test that, maintaining Type I errors at the  level, achieves the highest statistical power with IR-like data? In contrast to previous work, we follow a simulation approach that allows us to evaluate tests with unlimited IR-like data and under full control of the null hypothesis. In particular, we use a recent method for stochastic simulation of evaluation data [36, 39]. In essence, the idea is to build a generative stochastic model of the joint distribution of e ectiveness scores for a pair of systems, so that we can simulate an arbitrary number of new random topics from it. The model contains, among other things, the true distributions of both systems, so we have full knowledge of the true mean scores needed to compute test error rates.",null,null

50,"is not being conservative in terms of decisions made on the grounds of statistical testing. · Both the t-test and the permutation test behave almost identically. However, the t-test is simpler and remarkably robust to sample size, so it becomes our top recommendation. The permutation test is still useful though, because it can accommodate other test statistics besides the mean. · The bootstrap-shift test shows a systematic bias towards small p-values and is therefore more prone to Type I errors. Even though large sample sizes tend to correct this e ect, we propose its discontinuation as well. · We agree with previous work in that the Wilcoxon and sign tests should be discontinued for being unreliable. · The rate of Type III errors is not negligible, and for measures like P@10 and RR, or small topic sets, it can be as high as 2%. Testing in these cases should be carried with caution.",null,null

52,2 RELATED WORK,null,null

53,"One of the rst accounts of statistical signi cance testing in IR was given by van Rijsbergen [40], with a detailed description of the t, Wilcoxon and sign tests. Because IR evaluation data violates the assumptions of the rst two, the sign test was suggested as the test of choice. Hull [16] later described a wider range of tests for IR, and argued that the t-test is robust to violations of the normality assumption, specially with large samples. However, they did not provide empirical results. Shortly after, Savoy [32] stressed van Rijsbergen's concerns and proposed bootstrapping as a general method for testing in IR because it is free of distributional assumptions.",null,null
,,,
54,"An early empirical comparison of tests was carried out by Wilbur [44], who simulated system runs using a simple model of the rate at which relevant documents are retrieved [20]. Albeit unrealistic, this model allowed a preliminary study of statistical tests under knowledge of the null hypothesis. They showed that non-parametric tests, as well as those based on resampling, behaved quite well in terms of Type I error rate, also indicating preference for bootstrapping. Zobel [46] compared the t-test, Wilcoxon and ANOVA with a random 25­25 split of TREC Ad hoc topics, and found lower discordance rates with the t-test. However, they suggested the Wilcoxon test because it showed higher power and it has more relaxed assumptions. Although they did not study signi cance tests, Voorhees and Buckley [43] used TREC Ad hoc and Web data to analyze the rate of discordance given the observed di erence between two systems. Inspired by these two studies, Sanderson and Zobel [31] used several 25­25 splits of TREC Ad hoc topics and found that the t-test has lower discordance rates than the Wilcoxon test, followed by the sign test. Cormack and Lynam [11] later used 124­124 topic splits from the TREC Robust track to compare actual and expected discordance rates, and found the Wilcoxon test to be more powerful than the t and sign tests, though with higher discordance rates. Voorhees [42] similarly used 50­50 splits of the TREC Robust topics to study concordance rates of the t-test with score standardization. Finally, Sakai [25] also advocated for the bootstrap when evaluating e ectiveness measures, but did not compare to other tests.",Y,TREC

63,"The most comprehensive comparison of statistical tests for IR is probably the one by Smucker et al. [33]. From both theoretical and empirical angles, they compared the t, Wilcoxon, sign, bootstrapshift and permutation tests. From a theoretical standpoint, they recommend the permutation test and compare the others to it using TREC Ad hoc data. They propose the discontinuation of the Wilcoxon and sign tests because they tend to disagree, while the bootstrap and t-test show very high agreement with the permutation test. In a later study, they showed that this agreement is reduced with smaller samples, and that the bootstrap test appears to have a bias towards small p-values [34]. Inspired by Voorhees [42] and Smucker et al. [33], Urbano et al. [37] performed a largescale study with 50­50 splits of the TREC Robust data to compare statistical tests under di erent optimality criteria. They found the bootstrap test to be the most powerful, the t-test the one with lowest discordance rates, and the Wilcoxon test the most stable.",Y,TREC

308,"In order to simulate realistic IR evaluation that allows us to compare statistical tests, we use the method recently proposed by Urbano and Nagler [39], which extends an initial method by Urbano [36] to study topic set size design methods. In essence, they build a generative stochastic model M that captures the joint distribution of e ectiveness scores for a number of systems. An observation from this model would be the vector of scores achieved by the system on the same topic. This model contains two parts: the marginal distribution of each system, that is, its distribution of e ectiveness scores regardless of the other systems, and a copula [17] to model the dependence among systems, that is, how they tend to behave for the same topic. Because we will focus on paired statistical testing, in our case we will only contemplate bivariate models of only two systems B and E.",null,null

343,"Given a model M, we can inde nitely simulate evaluation scores for the same two systems but on new, random topics. The model de nes the two individual marginal distributions FB and FE , so it provides full knowledge about the null hypothesis because we know µB and µE beforehand. For the simulated data to be realistic, Urbano and Nagler [39] argue that the model rst needs to be exible enough to accommodate arbitrarily complex data; this is ensured by allowing a range of non-parametric models for both the margins and the copula. Finally, a realistic model can be instantiated by tting it to existing TREC data using a model selection criterion that rewards",Y,TREC

350,"null hypothesis H0 : µB = µE . We achieve this by assigning FE  FB after tting the margins and the copula. This way, we simulate data from two systems that have a certain dependence structure but the same margin distribution, so that µB = µE by construction. Second, and in order to study Type II and Type III error rates, we need to generate data with di erent e ect sizes. In particular, for a xed di erence  , we will need to make sure that µE = µB +  . Given an already tted stochastic model, Urbano and Nagler [39, §3.4] show how this requirement can be met by performing a slight transformation of FE that still maintains underlying properties of the distribution such as its support. For instance, if FE corresponds to P@10 scores, the transformed distribution will also generate valid P@10 scores. This way, we simulate data from two systems that have a certain dependence structure and whose expected scores are at a xed distance  .",null,null

353,"Because our goal is to evaluate the behavior of statistical tests on a variety of IR data, we chose systems and measures representative of ad hoc retrieval.

We therefore evaluate tests on measures producing smooth but asymmetric distributions",Y,TREC
,,,
354,"As is customary in this kind of experiments, we only use the top 90% of the runs to avoid errorful system implementations. This results in a total of 326 Ad hoc runs and 193 Web runs, from which we can use about 14,000 and 5,000 run pairs, respectively.

In such case, we make a directional decision based on a non-directional hypothesis, but that decision could very well be wrong. In our case, it could be that the baseline system really is better and the set of topics was just unfortunate. That is, H0 would still be correctly rejected, but for the wrong reason.

The e ect of the topic set size is clearly visible again in that the Wilcoxon and sign test become even more unreliable while the others signi cantly reduce the error rate. In particular, the bootstrap test catches up with the t and permutation tests. Di erences across measures are once again caused by the variability of their distributions.

On the other hand, ERR@20 is the most stable measure and the tests show better behavior with it.",null,null

990,"To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the rst empirical study of actual Type I and Type II error rates of typical paired statistical tests with IR data. Using a method for stochastic simulation of evaluation scores, we compared the t-test, Wilcoxon, sign, bootstrap-shift and permutation tests on more than 500 million p-values, making it also a 10-fold increase over the largest study to date. Our analysis also comprises di erent e ectiveness measures",null,null
,,,
991,"Our results con rm that the sign and Wilcoxon tests are unreliable for hypotheses about mean e ectiveness, specially with large sample sizes. One could argue that this is because they do not test hypotheses about means, but about medians. However, because of the symmetricity assumption, they are legitimately used as alternatives to the t-test with less strict assumptions. As suggested by previous research, the t-test and permutation test largely agree",null,null

993,"with each other, but the t-test appears to be slightly more robust to variations of sample size. On the other hand, the bootstrap-shift test is shown to have a clear bias towards small p-values. While this leads to higher power, our results con rm that it also has higher Type I error rates, so there is virtually no gain over the t or permutation tests. This bias decreases with sample size, so the only situation favorable to the bootstrap appears to be that of",null,null
,,,
994,"An advantage of our study is that it allows us to move past the typical discordance ratios used so far in the literature to compare tests. As discussed here and in previous work, without knowledge of the null hypothesis these discordances do not imply Type I errors. Thanks to our methodology based on simulation, we computed actual Type I error rates and found that both the t-test and the permutation test maintain errors at the nominal  level remarkably well, and they do so across measures and sample sizes. The tests are not being too conservative as previously suggested, and even though some e ectiveness measures are indeed more unstable than others, that does not imply a higher error rate in the tests.",null,null
,,,
995,"Based on our ndings, we strongly recommend the use of the ttest for typical hypotheses pertaining to mean system e ectiveness, and the permutation test for others. We provide further evidence that the bootstrap-shift test, although with nice theoretical properties, does not behave well unless the sample size is large, so we also recommend its discontinuation.",null,null
