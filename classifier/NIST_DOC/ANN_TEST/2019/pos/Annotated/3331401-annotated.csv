10,"Anserini is an open-source information retrieval toolkit built around Lucene to facilitate replicable research. In this demonstration, we examine different architectures for Solr integration in order to address two current limitations of the system: the lack of an interactive search interface and support for distributed retrieval. Two architectures are explored: In the first approach, Anserini is used as a frontend to index directly into a running Solr instance. In the second approach, Lucene indexes built directly with Anserini can be copied into a Solr installation and placed under its management. We discuss the tradeoffs associated with each architecture and report the results of a performance evaluation comparing indexing throughput. To illustrate the additional capabilities enabled by Anserini/Solr integration, we present a search interface built using the open-source Blacklight discovery interface.",null,null

,,,
21,"The first obvious question worth addressing for the academic audience is: Why not just build on top of Solr in the first place? Why is Anserini, for example, built around Lucene instead of Solr? We begin by first articulating the distinction between Lucene and Solr.",null,null

22,2.1 Lucene vs. Solr,null,null
,,,
23,"Lucene defines itself as a search library. Grant Ingersoll, a Lucene committer as well as the CTO and co-founder of Lucidworks, a company that provides commercial Lucene products and support, offers the analogy that Lucene is like ""a kit of parts"" [7]. It doesn't prescribe how one would assemble those parts",null,null
,,,
24,"Solr is a complete end-to-end search platform that uses Lucene for its core indexing and retrieval functionalities. Designed as a web application, Solr is ""self-contained"" in the sense that all interactions occur via HTTP-based API endpoints. Although there are many client libraries that facilitate access to Solr instances in a variety of programming languages, this design has two main drawbacks from the perspective of IR research:",null,null
,,,
25,"· Solr APIs were designed with developers of search applications in mind, and thus expose endpoints for indexing, search, administration, and other common operations. However, these APIs lack access to low-level Lucene internals needed by many researchers. While it is in principle possible to expose these functionalities as additional service endpoints for client access, this introduces friction for IR researchers.",null,null

35,"In other words, the Solr ""canonical assembly"" was not designed with IR researchers in mind. This is where Anserini comes in: it builds directly on Lucene and was specifically designed to simplify the ""inner loop"" of IR research on document ranking models. The system allows researchers to conduct ad hoc experiments on a broad range of test collections right out of the box, with adaptors for standard TREC document collections and topic files as well as integration with standard evaluation tools such as trec_eval. A researcher issues one command for indexing and a second command for performing a retrieval run--and is able to replicate results for a range of ranking models, from baseline bag-of-words ranking to competitive approaches that exploit phrase queries as well as",Y,TREC

36,2.2 Anserini Shortcomings,null,null
,,,
37,"While Anserini already supports academic information retrieval research using standard test collections, there are two main missing capabilities.",null,null
,,,
38,"The existing focus on supporting document ranking experiments means that the project has mostly neglected interactive search interfaces for humans. These are needed, for example, by researchers exploring interactive search and other human-in-the-loop retrieval techniques. Although Anserini has been integrated with other search frontends such as HiCAL [1], such efforts have been ad hoc and opportunistic. One obvious integration path is for Anserini to expose API endpoints for integration with different search interfaces. However, these are exactly the types of APIs that Solr already provides, and so such an approach seems like duplicate engineering effort with no clear-cut benefit.",null,null
,,,
39,"As another shortcoming, Anserini does not currently support distributed retrieval over large document collections in a partitioned manner, which is the standard architecture for horizontal scale-out. Although previous experiments have shown Anserini's ability to scale to ClueWeb12, the largest IR research collection currently available",Y,ClueWeb12

,,,
69,"An alternative approach to integrating Anserini with Solr is to build indexes directly on local disk, and then copy those indexes into an already running Solr instance. This is possible because Solr itself builds on Lucene, and thus all we need to do is to properly synchronize Solr index metadata with the index structures directly built by Anserini. This works even with a SolrCloud cluster: we can build inverted indexes over individual partitions of a collection, and then copy the data structures over to the appropriate node. In such an approach, the Anserini indexing pipeline remains unchanged, but we need a number of auxiliary scripts to mediate between Solr and the pre-built index structures.",null,null

It is difficult to perfectly balance throughput, and thus one side is often blocking, waiting for the other. In our experiments, we have taken reasonable effort to optimize various parameter settings across all our experimental conditions, but have not specifically tuned parameters for individual collections--and thus it is likely that more fine-grained collection-specific tuning can further increase performance.
