25,"Ferro and Sanderson [11] examined splitting the documents of a test collection into shards, measuring the performance of systems on each shard. They used an ANOVA model to understand if system performance changed across shards. The authors mentioned that significant differences between systems on sharded collections were more common than on unsharded. However, the reasons for the result was not explored as the experiment was designed to address a different research question. Voorhees et al. [39] randomly split a collection in half. The authors stated that the two resulting shards allowed more accurate performance measurement. However, it was reported that splitting the collection further did not improve accuracy; reasons for no improvement were not examined in detail."
26,We describe research that takes the Robertson and Kanoulas view that topics have unequal value and combines it with the ANOVA approach of Ferro and Sanderson [11] and the sharding method of Voorhees et al. [39]. We ask: Can the unequal value of topics be exploited to improve measurement of system performance accuracy on a test collection? We make the following contributions:
27,"и We validate an ANOVA model via a theoretical examination, showing why explicitly accounting for differences across topics yields accuracy improvements."
28,и We experimentally show that the model identifies notable numbers of significant differences between systems.
29,и We experimentally show that the differences are not due to measurement error of the significance formulas.

42,"arithmetic mean of topics scores. Swanson [33] described such a process in 1960. When the mean is taken, each topic score contributes equally regardless of the accuracy of that measure. The potential for error was described by Voorhees [36]: ""When [topics] have very few relevant documents"
43,"The notion that not all topics have equal value was implicitly exploited in work identifying a subset of test collection topics that rank systems similarly to a full topic set [13, 19]. To the best of our knowledge, however, Cormack and Lynam [9] were the first to incorporate an unequal view of topics into test collection measurement. They treated each topic as a ""separate test"", calculating topic confidence intervals using a bootstrap approach. Topics with  5 relevant documents were subject to a ""Small-R Correction"" to overcome measurement instability."
44,"Robertson [25] considered the broader question of what is the ""per-topic noise or error"" present in the topics of a test collection. The paper considered if evaluation measures could be adapted to cope with an unequal view of topics. Later, Robertson and Kanoulas [26] measured the variance of topic scores by bootstrapping from the document collection. The researchers found that topics showed different levels of variance, but the variance was relatively consistent across systems. The researchers described a significance test that incorporated topic score variation. Comparisons between the new test and the commonly used t-test showed some differences in the conclusions one might draw when comparing systems."
45,"More recently, Yang et al. [41] examined how much rankings of systems were affected by per-topic score variance and if there was any impact on significance tests. They found that the variance did not affect overall rankings notably, but that the number of significant differences observed between systems dropped."
46,"Note, there is much research on subjects such as query difficulty prediction [42], topic score normalization [40], average average precision [20], GMAP [24], etc. Such work focuses on so-called difficult topics, we focus on topics for which measurement is variable."
47,2.2 ANOVA modeling
48,"ANOVA can decompose the data of an IR experiment into a model of factors, into interactions between those factors, and into a level of unmodeled error. Tague-Sutcliffe and Blustein [34] described an example of this approach by comparing the variation in performance across two factors: topics and systems. The former was found to be larger than the latter. Measurement of interaction between topics and systems was not possible owing to a lack of replicates of topic*system measures. Banks et al. [2] approximated such an interaction, suggesting it would be strong and significant. Later, Bodoff and Li [3] used a test collection with multiple relevance assessments to obtain the required replicates. The authors reported that the magnitude of the topic*system interaction factor was less than the topic factor, but greater than the system factor."
49,Both Ferro and Sanderson [11] and Voorhees et al. [39] generated replicates by sharding a document collection. This enabled them to measure the topic*system effect. We describe that work next.
50,
51,2.3 Sharding
52,"Voorhees et al. [39] used a bootstrap ANOVA approach that drew on a sample of the scores of topics measured across different systems and shards. The researchers tested on the TREC-3, TREC-8, and 2006 Terabyte track collections. Success of the approach was measured by counting the number of significant differences found between systems submitted to TREC tracks. The researchers found substantially more such differences were measured than with conventional approaches. Two shards were used. When three or five shards were tried, the researchers found the number of significant differences dropped, the reasons for which were not examined in detail. The relative impact of each component of the technique Г bootstrap ANOVA, the approach to multiple comparisons, and sharding method Г was not described."
53,"As part of a study on the interaction between different types of shards and system scores, Ferro and Sanderson [11] described a series of ANOVA models tested on the TREC-7 and TREC-8 adhoc test collections. Like the previous research, the value of these models was quantified by the number of significant differences measured between systems. The researchers showed that a more sophisticated ANOVA model produced the highest number of significant differences measured between systems. However, the shards were very skewed in size."
54,"The research described shows that the topics of test collections can produce scores of different variance, which can impact the measurement of significance between systems. There is, as yet, not an extensive body of research examining such topic variability. Most work has explored bootstrap approaches from document collections to assess the variance. The recent examination of sharding has not been explored in conjunction with the work on topic variability. We explore the connection between these two lines of inquiry examining the style of ANOVA modeling used by Ferro and Sanderson [11]. We also measure the accuracy of the model across a range of sharding configurations that have not been examined before."

626,7 EFFECT OF UNDEFINED VALUES
627,
628,A notable challenge with sharding a document collection is topics
629,may not have any relevant documents in a shard. Ferro and Sander-
630,son [11] dealt with this by keeping only the topics for which there
631,"was at least one relevant document in each shard, thus reducing"
632,the number of usable topics. Voorhees et al. [39] resampled shards
633,until all shards contained relevant documents for all the topics.
634,"However, this introduces bias since the shards stop being random."
635,"Both approaches fail as the number of shards increase. As described above, we substitute an undefined value. We demon-"
636,strate that we can substitute undefined values with any value x and these values do not affect the identification of significant dif-
637,"ferences, the calculation of confidence intervals, and the effect size"
638,"of the system factor. We report here the main propositions but, for"
639,"space reasons, we cannot report the corresponding proofs. Detailed"
640,proofs are reported in the electronic appendix available online as
641,"supplementary material to the paper. In the example of Figure 2 we have T = 4 topics, R = 3 systems"
642,"and S = 2 shards. Topic 1 has no relevant documents in shard 1 and, therefore, all the systems have the undefined value x for that topic. Similarly, topic 3 has no relevant documents in shard 2 and topic 4 has no relevant in 1 and 2. Note, when relevant documents are missing, a whole ""row"" is filled in with x. This regularity, allows us to achieve a balanced design where the comparison of systems is independent of the undefined values."

1018,9.3 Robustness to Shard Sampling
1019,"Table 2 show the summary of the analyses for AP across different shard sizes when using ten samples for each shard size. The Kendall's  column reports the average value of  over the samples and its 95% confidence interval. For all the tracks, the  values are quite high with small confidence intervals. This suggest that the RoS is quite stable and does not depend much on the specific random shards. Similar considerations hold also in the case of the Tukey confidence interval, which gets smaller has the shard size increases and whose values are similar across shard samples. This suggests that the detection of significantly different systems is not affected much by the specific random shards at hand."
1020,"The total number of significantly different pairs support this hypothesis since we can see how the confidence interval around this value is small, indicating that their number does not change much when the shard sample changes. The final column reports the fraction of significant pairs found in common across all 10 samples. Here, there is a notable level of consistency across the samples."
