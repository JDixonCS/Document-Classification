5,"Topic variance has a greater effect on performances than system variance but it cannot be controlled by system developers who can only try to cope with it. On the other hand, system variance is important on its own, since it is what system developers may affect directly by changing system components and it determines the differences among systems. In this paper, we face the problem of studying system variance in order to better understand how much system components contribute to overall performances. To this end, we propose a methodology based on General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to develop statistical models able to isolate system variance, component effects as well as their interaction by relying on a Grid of Points (GoP) containing all the combinations of analysed components. We apply the proposed methodology to the analysis of TREC Ad-hoc data in order to show how it works and discuss some interesting outcomes of this new kind of analysis. Finally, we extend the analysis to different evaluation measures, showing how they impact on the sources of variance.",null,null
6,1. INTRODUCTION,null,null
7,"The experimental results analysis is a core activity in Information Retrieval (IR) aimed at, firstly, understanding and improving system performances and, secondly, assessing our own experimental methods, such as robustness of experimental collection or properties of the evaluation measures.

Nevertheless, with respect to an IR system, topic variance is a kind of ""external source"" of variation, which cannot be controlled by developers, but can only be taken into account to better deal with it.",null,null
18,"On the other hand, system variance is a kind of ""internal source"" of variation, since it is originated by the choice of system components, may be directly affected by developers by working on them, and represents the intrinsic differences between algorithms. Its importance is witnessed by the wealth of research on how to compare systems performances in a reliable and robust way [1, 2, 4, 9, 20Г23, 27].",null,null
19,"However, a limitation of the current experimental methodology is that it allows us to evaluate IR systems only as a kind of ""black-boxes"", without an understanding of how their different components interact with each other and contribute to the overall performances. In other terms, we consider system variance as a single monolithic contribution and we cannot break it down into the smaller pieces (the components) constituting an IR system.",null,null
20,"In order to estimate the effects of the different components of an IR system, we develop a methodology, based on General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) and ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) [13, 18], which makes us of a Grid of Points (GoP) containing all the possible combinations of inspected components. The proposed methodology allows us to break down the system effect into the contributions of stops lists, stemmers or n-grams and IR models, as well as to study their interaction.",null,null
21,"We experimented on standard Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) Ad-hoc collections and produced a GoP by using the Terrier1 open source IR system [12]. This gave us a very controlled experimental setting, which allowed us to systematically fit our General Linear Model (GLM) and break down the system variance. Note that such a controlled experimental setting is typically not available in evaluation campaigns, such as TREC, where participating systems do not constitute a systematic sampling of all the possible combinations of components and often are not even described in such a detail to know exactly what components have been used.",null,null

28,"The impossibility of testing a single component by setting it aside from the complete IR system is a long-standing and well-known problem in IR experimentation, as early remarked by [16]. Component-based evaluation methodologies [6Г8] have tried to tackle this issue by providing technical solutions for mixing different components without the need of building a whole IR system. However, even if these approaches allowed researchers to focus on the components of their own interest, they have not delivered yet estimates of the performance figures of each component.",null,null
29,"The decomposition of performances into system and topic effects has been exploited by [1, 23] to analyze TREC data; [4] proposed model-based inference, using linear models and ANOVA, as an approach to multiple comparisons; [10] used multivariate linear models to compare non-deterministic IR systems among them and with deterministic ones. In all these cases, the goal is a more accurate comparison among systems rather than an analysis and breakdown of system variance per se. [17] applied GLMM to the study of per-topic variance by using simulated data to generate more replicates for each (topic, system) pair in order to estimate also the topic/system interaction effect; however, they did not use real data nor did focus on breaking down the system effect.",null,null
30,"The idea of creating all the possible combinations of components has been proposed by [7], who noted that a systematic series of experiments on standard collections would have created a GoP, where (ideally) all the combinations of retrieval methods and components are represented, allowing us to gain more insights about the effectiveness of the different components and their interaction; this would have called also for the identification of suitable baselines with respect to which all the comparisons have to be made. Even though [7] introduced the idea of a GoP and how it could have been central to the decomposition of system component performances, they did not come up with an full-fledged methodology for analyzing such data and breaking down component performances, which is the contribution of the present work instead.",null,null
31,"More recently, the proliferation of open source IR systems [24] has greatly ameliorated the situation, allowing researchers to run systematic experiments more easily. This led the community to further investigate what reproducible baselines are [5, 11] and the ""Open-Source Information Retrieval Reproducibility Challenge"" provided several of these baselines, putting some points in the ideal GoP mentioned above. We move a step forward with respect to [11] since we propose an actual methodology for exploiting such GoPs to decompose system performances and we rely on a much finer-grained grid, in terms of number of components and IR models experimented.",null,null
32,3. METHODOLOGY,null,null
33,The goal of the proposed methodology is to decompose the effects of different components on the overall system perfor-,null,null
34,"mances. In particular, we are interested in investigating the effects of the following components: stop lists; Lexical Unit Generator (LUG), namely stemmers or n-grams; IR models, such as the vector space or the probabilistic model.",null,null
35,"We create a Grid of Points (GoP) on a standard experimental collection by running all the IR systems resulting from all the possible combinations of the considered components (stop list, LUG, IR model); we consider stemmers and n-grams as alternative LUG components, thus we do not consider IR systems using both stemmer and n-grams.",null,null
36,"Given a performance measure, such as Average Precision (AP), we produce a matrix Y , as the one shown in Figure 1, where each cell Yij represents a measurement on topic ti of the system sj. Note that the column average Г i.e., хиj Г is the performance mean over all topics for a given system, e.g. Mean Average Precision (MAP); the row average Г i.e., хiи Г is the performance mean over all systems for a given topic.",null,null

39,"The term ""General"" refers to the ability to accommodate distinctions on quantitative variables representing continuous measures (as in regression analysis) and categorical distinctions representing groups or experimental conditions (as in ANOVA). In our case, we deal with categorical independent variables, as for example different types of stemmers, which constitute the levels of such categorical variable. The term ""Linear"" indicates that the ""Model"" is expressed as a linear combination of factors, where the factors can be single independent variables or their combinations. In our case, we are interested both in single independent variables, i.e. the main effects of the different components alone, and their combinations, i.e. the interaction effects between components. The term ""Mixed"" refers to the fact that some independent variables are considered fixed effects Г i.e. they have precisely defined levels, and inferences about its effect apply only to those levels Г and some others are considered random effects Г i.e. they describe a randomly and independently drawn set of levels that represent variation in a clearly defined wider population; a random factor is indicated by adding a single quote as superscript to the variable name. In our case, the different kinds of systems and components are fixed effects while topics are random effects.",null,null
40,"The experimental design determines how you compute the model and how you estimate its parameters. In particular, it is possible to have independent measures designs where different subjects participate to different experimental conditions (factors) or repeated measures designs, where each subject participates to all the experimental conditions (factors). In our case systems and their components are the experimental conditions (factors) while topics are the subjects and, since each topic is processed by each system, we have a repeated measure design.",null,null
41,"One advantage of repeated measures designs is a reduction in error variance due to the greater similarity of the scores provided by the same subjects; in this way, variability in individual differences between subjects is removed from the error.

494,Table 2 shows that measures impact on the amount of,null,null

496,"effect sizes are higher when nDCG@20 is used, followed by",null,null
497,"RBP, P@10, AP and ERR@20. This could be related to two",null,null
498,characteristics of the measures: their discriminative power,null,null

502,models mean looking at (very) different angles of system,null,null
503,performances and this can change the explained variance.,null,null
504,"To explore a bit this hypothesis, in Table 3 we report the discriminative power of the five considered measures over the test collections calculated by employing the paired bootstrap test defined in [19]. We can see that there is some agreement between the system effect sizes for a measure and its discriminative power; for instance, ERR@20 explains less system variance than the other measures and this can be explained by its discriminative power which is the lowest amongst all measures; similarly, RBP and nDCG@20 have both comparable discriminative power and close system effect sizes. The main exception is AP which typically has the highest discriminative power but the smallest system effect size; this could be due to the user model behind AP, which is quite different from the one of the other measures and may counterbalance the higher discriminative power leading to a final lower system effect size.",null,null
505,4.2 Three Factors Repeated Measures Effects,null,null
506,In Table 4 we report the ANOVA table of a three factors test for the stemmer group of runs on TREC 08 measured with AP.,null,null
507,"We can see that the sum of squares of the topics is the same as the one determined with the single factor design, as well as the error and the total sum of squares. The main difference with the one factor design is that the variance of the systems is now decomposed into three main effects (stop list, stemmer and IR model) and four interaction effects. In this case all the main effects are statistically significant meaning that they have a role in explaining systems variance; in particular, the stop list explains more variance than the model and the stemmer is the component with the lowest impact in this design. Amongst the interaction effects, only the stoplist*model effect is significant explaining a tangible portion of the systems variance. The statistical power for the main effects is 0.97 for the stop list, 0.66 for the stemmer and 0.99 for the model with a Type 1 error probability  , 0.05.",null,null
508,Table 5 reports the estimated 2 SoA for all the main and interaction effects and the p-values for all the ANOVA three-way tests we conducted; from this this table we can see that main and interaction effect sizes are consistent across the different collections.,null,null
509,"Analyzing the main effect sizes reported in Table 5 we can see that for the stemmer group of runs the stop list has always a higher ^2 than the IR model and the stemmer and, with the solely exceptions of TREC 05 for AP and ERR@20, the stop list has a medium effect size. Whereas, n-grams tend to reduce the stop list effect and to increase the IR model one; this can be also seen from the n-grams*model interaction effect which is small but statistically significant, differently from the stemmer*model effect which is never significant.",null,null
510,"These observations cast a light on the importance of linguistic pre-processing and linguistic resources, given that the role of the stop list is significant in an IR system as well as choosing between stemmers or n-grams. We can further analyze these aspects by looking at Figure 3; the plot on the left reports the main effects for the TREC 08 stemmer group case and we show the marginal means (response means) described in Section 3.2 for the effect under investigation on the y-axis and the various components on the x-axis.",null,null

For the stemmer group of TREC 08, this can be seen in the plots on the upper-right and lower-left corners of Figure 4 where the lines of the interaction between the stop lists and the models intersect quite often. Indeed, the interaction plots show how the relationship between one factor and a response depends on the value of the second factor. These plots display means for the levels of one factor on the x-axis and a separate line for each level of another factor; if two lines (or segments) are parallel then no interaction occurs, if the lines are not parallel then an interaction occurs and the more nonparallel the lines are, the greater the strength of the interaction.",null,null

In Table 5 we can see that AP and ERR@20 weight the effects in a similar way as it happened in the single factor analysis reported in Table 2.

632,"In this paper we faced the issue of how system variance contributes to the overall performances and how to break it down into some of the main components constituting an IR system. To this end, we developed an analysis methodology consisting of two elements: a Grid of Points (GoP) created on standard experimental collections, where all the combinations of system components under examination are considered; and, a GLMM model to decompose the contribution of these components to the overall system variance, paired with some graphical tools for easily assessing the main and interaction effects.",null,null

654,"Moreover, we plan to further investigate the impact of the measures on the determination of effect sizes. A possible approach could be to conduct a four-factor analysis, using measures as additional factor. However, even if the measure scores are normalized in the range [0, 1], they do not mean the exactly the same thing, i.e. AP , 0.20 is not exactly the same as ERR ,"" 0.20 because of their different user models. A possibility for smoothing these differences and make the scores more directly comparable could be to normalize them by the maximum value achieved on the dataset, thus reasoning in term of ratios.""",null,null
655,"Lastly, an open challenge is how to run this kind of analysis on the systems which participated to past TREC editions. A first obstacle is that often there is no precise description of all the components used in these systems and so their metadata should be enriched in the way we suggested in [5]. A second obstacle is that the GoP would be very sparse and many combinations would be missing; therefore, we would need to rely on unbalanced GLMM and, probably, to consider the components as random factors.",null,null
