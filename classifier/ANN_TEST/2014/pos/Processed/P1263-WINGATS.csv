5,"Obesity and its associated health consequences such as high blood pressure and cardiac disease affect a significant proportion of the world's population. At the same time, the popularity of location-based services (LBS) and recommender systems is continually increasing with improvements in mobile technology. We observe that the health domain lacks a suggestion system that focuses on healthy lifestyle choices. We introduce the mobile application FitYou, which dynamically generates recommendations according to the user's current location and health condition as a real-time LBS. It utilizes preferences determined from user history and health information from a biometric profile. The system was developed upon a top performing contextual suggestion system in both TREC 2012 and 2013 Contextual Suggestion Tracks.",1,TREC,True

11,"A 2010 U.S. National survey found that more than onethird of U.S. adults were obese.1 Obesity greatly increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and strokes. In addition, the National Institutes of Health estimates obesity will cause approximately 500,000 additional cases of cancer by 2030 given the current obesity trends.2 There has never been a more important time for people to incorporate healthier dining options and some form of physical activity.",1,ad,True
12,"The Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) 2012-2013 Contextual Suggestion Tracks have identified technologies to retrieve and suggest venues to visit at a user's current location according to the user's rated preferences of past venues, current location's time, season, traffic, and temperature [2]. More general location-based recommender systems primarily use population interests, user interests, and friends' interests but often fail to address a health component. In FitYou, we add a health dimension on top of our TREC",1,TREC,True

19,"Some health domain LBS can find health care providers [1], but no system has yet accounted for the need to help people live healthier lifestyles. We propose that healthy, personalized contextual suggestions can be suggested by considering their medical history and future health goals. By integrating users' health needs and their preferences, suggestions can be further personalized to help users live healthier and happier. Although users can consult with a nutritionist or physician, a specialist may not always be readily available. Thus, it is important to have technology that can generate personalized suggestions whenever necessary.",1,ad,True
