8,"In probabilistic BM25, term frequency normalization is one of the key components. It is often controlled by parameters k1 and b, which need to be optimized for each given data set. In this paper, we assume and show empirically that term frequency normalization should be specific with query length in order to optimize retrieval performance. Following this intuition, we first propose a new term frequency normalization with query length for probabilistic information retrieval, namely BM25QL. Then BM25QL is incorporated into the state-of-the-art models CRTER2 and LDA-BM25, denoted as CRTER2QL and LDA-BM25QL respectively. A series of experiments show that our proposed approaches BM25QL, CRTER2QL and LDA-BM25QL are comparable to BM25, CRTER2 and LDA-BM25 with the optimal b setting in terms of MAP on all the data sets.",1,corpora,True

12,1 INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK,1,DUC,True
13,"Term frequency (TF) normalization is very important in information retrieval (IR) models. There are kinds of term frequency normalization achieving success. Sub-linear term frequency normalization in BM25 [10] is one of state-of-the-art approaches in the last two decades. It has two hyper-parameters (k1 and b), which are as term independent constants and often need to be optimized for each given data set [4]. In recent years, much research work started to focus on the automatic tuning of document length normalization. TF normalization approaches in [4, 8, 9, 14] are document and collection dependent, and fixed term-independent parameter",1,ad,True

16,"setting remained the same as the original BM25. Cummins et al. [1] first investigated the effect of query length on normalization but didn't measure the effect. [2, 6, 7] used query length normalization constraints to estimate term-specific parameters, which may be expensive and overfitted. Chung et al. [15] have incorporated the query-length into vector space model and conducted experiments on Chinese and English corpora, suggesting that the query-length should be incorporated in other existing ranking functions. So it is worth studying how to simply and effectively incorporate query length into probabilistic model.",1,corpora,True

These data sets are different in sizes and genres, including high-quality newswire collections and Web collections containing many noisy documents. In all the experiments, we only use the title field of the TREC queries for retrieval. Queries without judgments are removed. For all test data sets used, each term is stemmed by using Porter's English stemmer. Standard English stopwords are removed. The official TREC evaluation measure is used in our experiments, namely Mean Average Precision (MAP).",1,TREC,True
149,"For fair comparisons, we use the following parameter settings for both the baselines and our proposed models, which are popular in the IR domain for building strong baselines. First, in BM25, k1 and k3 are set to be 1.2 and 8. Meanwhile, we sweep the values of b for BM25 from 0 to 1.0 with an interval of 0.05. Second, in CRTER2, we sweep the values of normalization parameter  in a group of different values 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, and triangle kernel was shown in [5] to achieve best MAP for most data sets. Thirdly, in LDA modeling, we use symmetric Dirichlet priors with  , 50/Kt and  ,"" 0.01, which are common settings in the literature and shown in [3, 16] that retrieval results were not very sensitive to the values of these parameters. The number of topics Kt is set to be 400 as recommended in [3, 16].

588,"Finally, we further incorporate our proposed BM25QL models into state-of-the-art BM25-based model with topic modeling. Jian et al. [3] showed that LDA-BM25 is at least comparable to the state-ofthe-art model CRTER2. The performance of our proposed LDA-BM25QL and LDA-BM25 is presented in Figure 3. From Figure 3, we can find that LDA-BM25QL models are also comparable to LDA-BM25 with optimal b in MAP on almost all data sets. The performance is even better than searching the parameter space on several data sets, such as LA, WSJ, DISK1&2 and WT2G.",1,corpora,True
589,4.4 Analysis and Discussion,0,,False
590,"The experimental results show that our proposed models have consistent good performance in all scenarios on all data sets. In some occasions, the performance is even better than the heuristic best b-value. This is because that the new variable bQL is self-adjusted for each query, while given the heuristic b-value is tested for all queries on an entire collection. bQL is more adaptive, especially in real applications when the queries are quite different from each other. The functions proposed in Formula (3)-(5) perform similarly in terms of MAP. Although more functions could be considered to define the bQL, most of the functions grow faster than the logarithm function and slower compared with the exponential function. According to the experimental results, we can see that the retrieval performance can be guaranteed using any of the proposed functions in Formula (3)-(5).",1,ad,True
591,5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK,0,,False
592,"In this paper, we propose a new term frequency normalization model BM25QL for probabilistic IR. Specifically, we present three term frequency normalization functions: logarithmic function, reciprocal function and exponential function. We also incorporate BM25QL into two state-of-the-art BM25-based models CRTER2 and LDA-BM25. Experimental results on eight standard TREC data sets show that BM25QL, CRTER2QL and LDA-BM25QL at least comparable to and sometimes even better than BM25, CRTER2 and LDA-BM25 with the optimal b in terms of MAP.",1,corpora,True
