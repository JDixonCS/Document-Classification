14,"Axiomatic analysis is a well-defined theoretical framework for analytical evaluation of information retrieval models. The current studies in axiomatic analysis implicitly assume that the constraints (axioms) are independent. In this paper, we revisit this assumption and hypothesize that there might be interdependence relationships between the existing constraints. As a preliminary study, we focus on the pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) models that have been theoretically studied using the axiomatic analysis approach. In this paper, we introduce two novel interdependent PRF constraints which emphasize on the effect of existing constraints on each other. We further modify two state-of-the-art PRF models, log-logistic and relevance models, in order to satisfy the proposed constraints. Experiments on three TREC newswire and web collections demonstrate that the proposed modifications significantly outperform the baselines, in all cases.",1,TREC,True

17,"Many information retrieval (IR) models consist of heuristic components and/or make several simplifying assumptions that are not necessarily correct. Axiomatic analysis [1, 6, 11] provides a welldefined theoretic structure in order to study IR models analytically, which often lead to empirical improvements. In the axiomatic analysis framework, a number of constraints, also called axioms, are defined and IR models are designed or modified to satisfy these constraints. Previous work on axiomatic analysis literature assumes that axioms are independent of each other, and thus the models are studied given each axiom, separately.",1,ad,True

20,"In this paper, we revisit this assumption and hypothesize that there might be an interdependence relationship between different axioms. As a preliminary study, we focus on analyzing the pseudorelevance feedback (PRF) models. PRF is a well-known strategy to address the vocabulary mismatch problem in information retrieval (IR). PRF assumes that the top retrieved documents in response to an initial query are relevant to the query and uses these documents for estimating a more accurate query model. Previous works have shown that PRF models can benefit from axiomatic analysis. For instance, Clinchant and Gaussier [4] proposed five constraints for PRF models and showed that even state-of-the-art PRF models do not satisfy all of the constraints. Following their work, a number of other constraints have been proposed and several modifications have been suggested for PRF models, e.g., see [2, 8­10].",1,ad,True
21,"In this paper, we propose two interdependent constraints. The first constraint takes the interdependence relationship of the term frequency (TF) and the inverse document frequency (IDF) into account. ""TF effect"" and ""IDF effect"", that are two existing constraints respectively corresponding to TF and IDF, have been previously considered independently [4]. Our first constraint shows the effect of IDF on the TF constraint. With a similar idea, our second constraint focuses on the relationship between term frequency and document relevance scores. In fact, this constraint indicates that the influence of term frequency on the feedback weight should depend on the relevance score of the documents containing the term.",0,,False
22,"Furthermore, we study two state-of-the-art PRF models, the loglogistic feedback model [3] and the relevance model [7], and modify these two models in order to satisfy the proposed interdependent constraints. The empirical evaluation on three TREC collections demonstrates the effectiveness of each of the proposed constraints. Our modifications to the log-logistic and relevance models lead to significant improvements in all collections. We believe that, our findings open up a new research direction by considering the interdependence relationship between constraints when studying IR models in different tasks.",1,TREC,True

Consequently, the difference of feedback weight between two terms caused by discrimination value of them, should increase when these two terms are added to the feedback document.

322,"To study the effect of each constraint in the retrieval performance, we modify the log-logistic model based on each constraint, separately. Equations (7) and (10) are the feedback weight functions that satisfy the TF-IDF and the TF-SRS constraints, respectively. We also modify the log-logistic model by considering all of these constraints, called LL+ALL (see Equation (12)). The results obtained by the baselines and those achieved by the proposed modifications are reported in Table 1. LL outperforms the NoPRF baseline in all cases, which indicates the effectiveness of the log-logistic model and validates the findings presented in prior work [3, 8]. Both LLR+TFIDF and LLR+TF-SRS outperform all three baselines (NoPRF, LL, and LLR), which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed constraints. The improvements achieved by LLR+TF-SRS is higher than those obtained by LLR+TF-IDF. This indicates that the interdependence between t f and SRS which models the local importance of the term is more effective than the interaction between t f and id f which models the global importance of the term. In addition, LLR+TF-SRS and LLR+TF-IDF are shown to be more robust than the baselines in all the collections. LLR+TF-SRS performs more robust compared to LLR+TF-IDF, in all the collections, especially the web collection. The MAP improvements for both LLR+TF-IDF and LLR+TF-SRS methods are close to each other in all the collections specially in the noisy collection (WT10g) which shows that both of these two constraints are important for PRF methods.",1,ad,True

324,"3.2.2 Evaluating the Modified Relevance Model. In this set of experiments, we consider two baselines: (1) the document retrieval method without feedback (NoPRF) computed by query likelihood, and (2) the RM3 method [7]. Since the proposed approach satisfies both constraints simultaneously (we do not propose different solutions for satisfying different axioms), we only report the results for RM3+ALL. As shown in Table 1, RM3+ALL significantly outperforms both baselines (NoPRF and RM3) in all collections, in terms of MAP. The P@10 values achieved by the proposed method is also higher than those achieved by the baselines, in all cases. This shows that our modification to RM3 leads to better performance by satisfying the proposed constraints. Our modification also makes the relevance model more robust, especially in the web collection.",1,MAP,True
325,4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK,0,,False
326,"In this paper, we proposed two novel constraints for pseudo-relevance feedback models, which focus on the interdependence relation of the existing constraints that have been previously considered as independent. To show the importance of these interdependent constraints, we studied and modified two state-of-the-art pseudorelevance feedback models; the log-logistic and the relevance models. Our evaluation on three standard newswire and web collections investigates the effect of each of these constraints on the overall effectiveness and robustness of the models. Our modifications lead to significant improvements over the baselines in all the collections. These observations suggest that taking the interdependence relationship of the constraints into account might lead to designing more accurate IR models, which could be an interesting research direction for future work.",1,ad,True
