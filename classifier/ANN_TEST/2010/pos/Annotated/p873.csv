6,"Analyzing the large volume of online reviews would produce useful knowledge that could be of economic values to vendors and other interested parties. In particular, the sentiments expressed in the online reviews have been shown to be strongly correlated with the sales performance of products. In this paper, we present an adaptive sentiment analysis model called S-PLSA+, which aims to capture the hidden sentiment factors in the reviews with the capability to be incrementally updated as more data become available. We show how S-PLSA+can be applied to sales performance prediction using an ARSA model developed in previous literature. A case study is conducted in the movie domain, and results from preliminary experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model.",1,ad,True

13,1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
14,"Online reviews present a wealth of information on products and services, and if properly utilized, can provide vendors highly valuable intelligence to facilitate the improvement of their business. As such, a growing number of recent studies have focused on the economic values of reviews, exploring the relationship between the sales performance of products and their reviews [3, 2, 4]. Gruhl et al. [3] show that the volume of relevant postings can help predict the sales rank of books on Amazon, especially the spikes in sales ranks. Ghose et al. [2] also demonstrate that subjectivity of reviews can have an impact on sales performance.",0,,False
15,"Liu et al. [4] propose a probability model called Sentiment PLSA (S-PLSA for short) based on the assumption that sentiment consists of multiple hidden aspects. They develop a model called ARSA (which stands for Auto-Regressive Sentiment-Aware) to quantitatively measure the relationship between sentiment aspects and reviews. Our experience with running ARSA on several online review datasets reveals that the model is highly sensitive to the sentiment factors, which are constantly changing over time as new reviews become available. It is therefore essential to allow the SPLSA model to adapt to newly available review data.",1,ad,True

17,"To this end, we take a Bayesian approach, and propose an adaptive version of the S-PLSA model that is equipped with the incremental learning capability for continuously updating the model using newly observed reviews. The proposed model is motivated by the principle of quasi-Bayesian (QB) estimation, which has found successful applications in various domains such as adaptive speech recognition and text retrieval [1]. We call the proposed model the S-PLSA+model, in which the parameters are estimated by maximizing an approximate posterior distribution. One salient feature of our modeling is the judicious use of hyperparameters, which can be recursively updated in order to obtain up-to-date posterior distribution and to estimate new model parameters. This modeling approach makes it possible to efficiently update the model parameters in an incremental manner without the need to re-train the model from scratch each time as new reviews become available.",1,ad,True

Preliminary experimental results show that by allowing the model to be adaptive, we can capture new sentiment factors arising from newly available reviews, which can greatly improve the prediction accuracy. For future work, we plan to study the performance of S-PLSA+in other information retrieval and data mining tasks.",1,ad,True
