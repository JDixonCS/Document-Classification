10,"Logistic average misclassification percentage (lam%) is a key measure for the spam filtering performance. This paper demonstrates that a spam filter can achieve a perfect 0.00% in lam%, the minimal value in theory, by simply setting a biased threshold during the classifier modeling. At the same time, the overall classification performance reaches only a low accuracy. The result suggests that the role of lam% for spam filtering evaluation should be re-examined.",0,,False

17,1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
18,"The spam filtering is generally regarded as a binary classification task to identify spams from normal e-mails (i.e. hams). To evaluate the performance of spam filters, the overall classification accuracy (or the total proportion of misclassified messages) is not a good choice because all errors are treated on equal footing. Nevertheless, the logistic average misclassification percentage (lam%), a single quality measure based only on the filter's binary ham/spam classification accuracy, is proposed as: lam% ,"" logit-1 ((logit(hm%)+logit(sm%))/2), where logit(x)"",""log(x/(1-x)), in which hm% is ham misclassification percentage, and sm% is spam misclassification percentage[1]. As the geometric mean of the odds of ham and spam misclassification[1], lam% is widely adopted together with 1-AUC by open spam filtering competitions including TREC Spam Filtering Track and CEAS(Conference on Email and Anti-Spam) Spam-filter Challenge. The lam% is designed to impose no a priori relative importance on either ham or spam misclassification, rewarding equally an improvement in the odds of either. However, this paper demonstrates that lam% is inherently defected in allowing a 0.00% by a biased threshold, whereas maintaining a very high error rate. Therefore, it is not reliable enough to observe only lam% as the measure for spam filtering evaluation.""",1,ad,True

34,"Each message with its score above the threshold is labeled as spam, otherwise ham. Through setting a biased threshold, i.e. setting the threshold very high or very low, hm% or sm% could approach zero, and so lam% will tend eventually to be zero.

The threshold can be set nearly to 1 or 0, which can decrease hm% or sm% to 0. LR with the biased threshold is referred as biased LR. For biased LR, pseudo codes are the same to the traditional LR except that Line 4 is replaced by ""if ( p > threshold ) predict spam"". Note that the weight updating in biased LR is not changed, and thus the final prediction scores of messages are not biased (i.e. not changed).",1,ad,True

Therefore, there is an obvious defect in lam% as the measure for spam filtering evaluation.",0,,False

Swapped pairs are defined as pairs that are ranked in the wrong order. Hence, ROC area also has a probabilistic interpretation: the probability that a random ham will receive a lower score than a random spam[1]. Because of this pair-wise correct measure [4] and unchanged prediction score of the biased LR, 1-AUC is unchanged too.""",0,,False
