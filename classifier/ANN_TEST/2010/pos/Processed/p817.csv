7,"Opinion retrieval involves the measuring of opinion score of a document about the given topic. We propose a new method, namely sentiment-relevance flow, that naturally unifies the topic relevance and the opinionated nature of a document. Experiments conducted over a large-scaled Web corpus show that the proposed approach improves performance of opinion retrieval in terms of precision at top ranks.",0,,False

15,"Opinion retrieval is a new retrieval task which involves locating documents that express opinions about a topic of interest. With the rapid growth of user-centric media such as blogs and forums, opinion retrieval has been gaining considerable attention in recent years from academia and industry motivated by the huge business opportunities.",1,blog,True
16,"A key to success in opinion retrieval is to leverage both the topical relevance and the opinionated nature of documents simultaneously in ranking. However, most opinion retrieval systems separate the two components independently by adopting a re-ranking approach [1]. This approach involves finding as many relevant documents with regard to a given topic as possible regardless of their opinionated nature at first and then re-ranking them by combining the topical relevance scores with the opinion scores computed using some opinion detection techniques. Although a few approaches have shown attempts to unify the two components, for example, by using the proximity between topic words and opinion words within a document [3], the results are not yet conclusive and require more investigation.",1,ad,True

19,"In this paper, we present a new opinion retrieval method that adopts a very recently proposed technique involving relevance flow graphs [2]. A relevance flow graph of a document is a graphical plot of the topic relevance degree of individual sentences (with regard to a query) versus their positions in the document. The line graph labeled ""Relevance"" in Figure 1 illustrates an example; it visually shows the fluctuation of topic relevance levels within a document in regard to the query. [2] demonstrates that topically relevant documents have distinguishable flows from non-relevant ones in terms of the variance of relevance levels or the positions of high relevance levels (namely peaks), by designing a regression model based on such information and applying it to re-rank the retrieved results of conventional document ranking. Such method has shown promising results in improving the accuracy at top ranks.",1,ad,True
20,"Motivated by this achievement, we hypothesize that a truly relevant document in opinion retrieval not only has opinion sentences regarding the topic but does have them in predictable patterns within the document. Our idea is to create a new flow graph, namely sentiment flow, that plots the opinionated nature of individual sentences using some opinion scoring method, and then merge it with the topic relevance flow to generate a whole new flow graph, called sentiment-relevance flow. The dotted line graph labeled ""Sent-Rel"" in Figure 1 illustrates an example. The following section will elaborate on such technique.",0,,False

In other words, we initially retrieve the top n (,""15) documents using two popular ranking models, the BM25 model and the query likelihood (QL) language model with dirichlet smoothing1, and then re-rank the results using Equation 3. When evaluating one query set (50 topics), other two query sets (100 topics) are used to train a regression model. 15 top ranked documents for every training query are divided into positive and negative training instance groups based on their relevance judgments. The main evaluation measures are P@1, P@3, and P@5 since our method aims to achieve high accuracy at top ranks via re-ranking.

68,"In aspect of opinion retrieval, as shown in Table 2, SRF shows significant and consistant improvement. We compare our method with two previous re-ranking approaches for opinion retrieval with QL setting (since it outperforms BM25). Opinion score measured by QL+FULL is dominated by a number of opinion words that appeared in a whole document, while QL+PROX only considers opinion words located within W sentences from the query terms. We can observe that proximity is a helpful feature for opinion retrieval. It is remarkable that our sentiment-relevance flow based re-ranking scheme achieves better improvement. Note that the maximum performance are acheived on low  values which implies that the trained regression model based on SRF features are very accurate and reliable.",0,,False
