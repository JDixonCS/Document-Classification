10,"Through the investigation of email document structure, this paper proposes a multi-field learning (MFL) framework, which breaks the multi-field document Text Classification (TC) problem into several sub-document TC problems, and makes the final category prediction by weighted linear combination of several subdocument TC results. Many previous statistical TC algorithms can be easily rebuilt within the MFL framework via turning binary result to spamminess score, which is a real number and reflects the likelihood that the classified email is spam. The experimental results in the TREC spam track show that the performances of many TC algorithms can be improved within the MFL framework.",1,TREC,True

17,1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
18,"Currently email spam filtering is normally considered as an online binary Text Classification (TC) task, and many robust statistical TC algorithms have been proposed [1]. In these algorithms, email is often treated as a single plain-text document, and text feature is also extracted within this single document. Actually a full email (often including five natural text fields: Header, From, ToCcBcc, Subject, and Body) is a multi-field text document. Feature extraction from full email document makes many text features disturb each other, and text feature from one field is often noise to other fields.",1,ad,True
19,"In statistical TC algorithms, a document is normally represented as a text feature vector. The dimension of feature vector space, the total number of text features, reflects the representational granularity of vector space model. Previous research has shown that overlapping word-level k-grams model can achieve promising results [2]. For email document, single plain-text model (SPTM) and multi-field model (MFM) are two representations. The SPTM ignores the field information of text feature, regarding the same string occurrence in different fields as single text feature, while the MFM treats it as distinct text features. The dimension of",0,,False

21,"feature vector space for trec07p email set is showed in Table 1. For the two email representations, four overlapping word-level models are applied respectively. For MFM, the five natural text fields' information is considered.",1,trec,True

For instance, this obvious difference between two representations reaches 1,011,087 for 4-grams model. The result from Table 1 indicates that text feature noises exist indeed in SPTM. Because more finely granular text feature can reduce the noises and increase the TC accuracy, this paper proposes a multi-field learning (MFL) framework, which is an alignment technique of text feature sources. In MFL framework, text features are enhanced by field information, and the disturbances among text features from different fields are expected to be reduced.",0,,False

25,"In order to reduce the text feature noises of multi-field document, the proposed MFL framework makes use of multi-field structural feature by the divide-and-conquer strategy. Figure 1 shows the MFL framework for multi-field document binary TC. The framework includes a Splitter, a Combiner, and several Scorers. The Splitter analyses a multi-field document, and splits it to several sub-documents according to the natural field structure or some explicit rules. The text feature extracting, the scorer training and updating, and the sub-document predicting are only localized in the sub-documents from the same field. Each scorer calculates a spamminess score (SS) for its corresponding sub-document, and sends the SS to the Combiner. The Combiner combines multiscorer's SSs to form the final SS, which is a real number in [0, 1]. If the final SS is in [0, 0.5], then the document is predicted as a ham, otherwise, if the final SS is in (0.5, 1], it is predicted as a spam.",0,,False

38,"In MFL framework, the weighted linear combination method is designed for combining n scorer's output scores to form the final SS. The formula of calculating SS is SS,""iSSi, (i"",""1, 2, ... , n), where SSi indicates the ith scorer's output SS, and the weight i indicates the historical classification ability of the ith scorer. The normalized TC accuracy rates are used to estimate the weights.""",0,,False
39,"Except five natural sub-documents from the five natural text fields of email, some artificial sub-documents can be extracted by some explicit rules. For instance, the regular expression can be applied to extract all IP addresses in email Header to form an artificial sub-document. This artificial method can generate a new field sub-document which does not exist in actual multi-field document, which is equivalent to increasing the statistical weight for some attributed texts, and such texts often have an explicit optimal TC rule.",1,ad,True
40,"It is nearly a supervised online binary TC process that the scorer receives a sub-document and calculates a SS according to its TC model. Previous supervised online binary TC algorithms can be rebuilt into these scoring algorithms by changing a binary output to a continuous SS output. So, MFL framework is a general frame for ensemble previous TC algorithms.",0,,False

42,"Email is a typical multi-field document, so this paper verifies the validity of MFL framework through the email spam filtering experiment of Immediate Full Feedback defined in the TREC2007 spam track [3]. The TREC spam filter evaluation toolkit and the associated evaluation methodology are applied. Experiment corpus is trec07p email set. The running hardware environment is a PC with 1GB memory and 2.80GHz Pentium D CPU.",1,TREC,True
43,"A MFL framework of seven sub-documents for email document is implemented, in which the Splitter extracts five sub-documents (Header, From, ToCcBcc, Subject, and Body) by natural field structure and extracts two sub-documents (H.IP, H.EmailBox) by regular expressions. The H.IP contains IP address text and H.EmailBox contains Emailbox address text within email Header. Each scorer's historical SS outputs can be drawn to a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The percentage of the area below the ROC curve (ROCA%) indicates the historical classification ability, and the ROCA% is reasonable to estimate the classification accuracy rate of a scorer. So, before an email classified, the MFL framework normalize current seven ROCA% values to estimate the weights of scorers.",1,ad,True
44,"To verify that MFL framework's effect on improving the performance of previous TC algorithms, two typical online TC algorithms are run in MFL framework. The bogo filter (bogo0.93.4) is a classical implementation of online Bayesian statistical algorithm [4], while the tftS3F filter is based on relaxed online SVMs algorithm and has gained several best results in the TREC2007 spam track [5]. We report (1-ROCA)% overall performance, where 0 is optimal. Table 2 shows the overall performance of filters affected by this paper proposed approaches in the rank reference of top three filters in the TREC2007 spam track whose font is italic. In Table 2, the (.mfl) postfix indicates running in MFL framework. The experimental results show that the bogo filter's (1-ROCA)% is optimized from original 0.1558 to mfl's 0.0103, and the tftS3F filter's (1-ROCA)% is also optimized from original 0.0093 to mfl's 0.0083.",1,TREC,True

60,"This paper elucidates that the structural feature of multi-field document is very useful for statistical TC algorithm. The proposed MFL framework represents more finely granular text feature with field information, and takes advantage of the structural feature. The experiment shows that MFL framework can improve the performance of many TC algorithms. Moreover, MFL framework is suitable to parallel running environment, if it is applied on the reduplicate hardware for multiple scorers, the theoretical computational time of MFL framework to classify a document is nearly equal to the lowest scorer's running time.",1,ad,True
61,"Further research will concern semi-supervised learning, active learning, and personal learning for spam filtering within MFL framework. We will apply large-scale unlabeled emails, select effective samples for training by mining differences among multiple scorers of MFL framework, and improve the TC model for both global and personal filtering.",0,,False
