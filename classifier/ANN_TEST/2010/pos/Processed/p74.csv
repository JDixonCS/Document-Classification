6,"It is crucial to study basic principles that support adaptive and scalable retrieval functions in large networked environments such as the Web, where information is distributed among dynamic systems. We conducted experiments on decentralized IR operations on various scales of information networks and analyzed effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of various search methods. Results showed network structure, i.e., how distributed systems connect to one another, is crucial for retrieval performance. Relying on partial indexes of distributed systems, some level of network clustering enabled very efficient and effective discovery of relevant information in large scale networks. For a given network clustering level, search time was well explained by a polylogarithmic relation to network size (i.e., the number of distributed systems), indicating a high scalability potential for searching in a growing information space. In addition, network clustering only involved local self-organization and required no global control ­ clustering time remained roughly constant across the various scales of networks.",1,ad,True

Likewise, digital libraries interoperate with one another and serve information distributed across collections in a network. For reasons such as copyright and privacy, lots of information cannot be fully collected and indexed in advance for retrieval purposes. In addition to this is the dynamics of many environments such as the deep web and peer-to-peer networks, in which it is not only difficult to gather information but also challenging to keep an index up to date.",1,ad,True
21,"Centralized IR solutions can hardly survive the continued growth of today's information spaces ­ they are vulnerable to scalability demands [3]. A distributed architecture is desirable and, due to many constraints, is often the only choice. Distributed (federated) IR research is a response to the challenge of retrieving information from distributed sources. Recent distributed IR research has focused on intra-system retrieval fusion/federation, cross-system communication, and distributed information storage and retrieval algorithms [9, 23].",0,,False
22,"Classic distributed information retrieval has shown some potential of efficiently and effectively bringing distributed information together. However, the reliance on centralization of a metasearch server will continue to suffer from critical problems such as scalability, single point failure, and fault tolerance.

28,"While traditional IR and distributed IR research provides basic tools for attacking decentralized search problems, the evolving dynamics and heterogeneity of today's networked environments challenge the sufficiency of classic methods and call for new innovations [3].

Without global information, decentralized IR methods have to rely on individual indexes in distributed nodes and their limited local intelligence to collectively construct paths to desired information.",0,,False
31,"Recent years have seen growing popularity of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks for large scale information sharing and retrieval [17]. There have been ongoing discussions on the applicability of existing P2P search models for IR, the efficiency and scalability challenges, and the effectiveness of traditional IR models in such environments [23]. Some researchers applied Distributed Hashing Tables (DHTs) techniques to structured P2P environments for distributed retrieval and focused on building an efficient indexing structure over peers [7, 18, 21].",1,ad,True
32,"Others, however, questioned the sufficiency of DHTs for dealing with high dimensionality of IR (e.g., a large number of terms for document representation) in dynamic P2P environments [5, 17, 16]. For retrieval with a large feature space, which often requires frequent updates to cope with a transient population, it is challenging for distributed hashing to work in a traffic- and space-efficient manner. Unstructured overlay systems work in an nondeterministic manner and have received increased popularity for being fault tolerant and adaptive to evolving system dynamics [17].",1,ad,True
33,2.2 Decentralized Search in Networks,0,,False
34,"Research on complex networks provides valuable principles for searching/navigation in distributed systems. Not only do many information networks such as the Web share the common phenomenon of small world but they also appear to be searchable [2]. Particularly, studies showed that without global information about where targets are, members of a very large network are able to collectively construct short paths (if not the shortest) to destinations [15, 22, 8].",0,,False
35,"The implication in IR is that relevant information, in various networked environments, is very likely a small number of connections/links away from the one who needs it and is potentially findable. This indicates potentials for decentralized retrieval algorithms to traverse an information network to find relevant information efficiently. However, this is not an easy task because not only relevant information is a few degrees/connects away but so is all information.",0,,False

Network clustering, sometimes by means of semantic overlay, can significantly improve effectiveness and efficiency of IR operations in an information network.",0,,False
38,"Clustering, the process of bringing similar entities together, is useful for information retrieval. Traditional IR research utilized document-level clustering to support exploratory searching and to improve retrieval effectiveness. In large scale distributed IR, topical clustering techniques such as semantic overlay networks (SONs) have been widely used, in which systems containing similar information form semantic groups for efficient searches [5, 10, 16].",1,ad,True
39,"Research indicated that a proper degree of network clustering with some presence of remote connections has to be maintained for efficient searches [15, 20]. Clustering reduces the number of ""irrelevant"" links and aids in creating topical segments useful for orienting searches. With very strong clustering, however, a network tends to be fragmented into local communities with abundant strong ties but few weak ties to bridge remote parts [12]. Although searches might be able to move gradually toward targets, necessary ""hops"" become unavailable. We refer to this phenomenon as the Clustering Paradox, in which neither strong clustering nor weak clustering is desirable. The Clustering Paradox has received attention in complex network research and requires further scrutiny in a decentralized IR context [15, 14].",1,ad,True

Therefore, there requires a mechanism for matching query representation with potential good neighbors ­ either the neighboring agent is more likely to have relevant information to answer the query directly or more likely to connected with relevant targets.
