91,"To study the effectiveness of the strategies proposed in the previous section, we evaluate the QPRP in the context of subtopic retrieval, employing the TREC 678 interactive collection with the subtopics judgements described in [9], and the recent ClueWeb collection (part B only), along with the topics defined for the Web diversity track. Using the Lemur Toolkit 4.10 we indexed these collections, where stemming was applied and stop words removed. For the QPRP, we test both pairwise and surrogate comparisons, and examine a number of similarity functions to act as fsim: L1 and L2 norms, cosine similarity, Jaccard coefficients, Pearson's correlation, Bayesian correlation score, KL, JSD, skew divergences [5]. The best performing approximations are reported here. Each of the different QPRP approximations were compared against the default PRP baseline, i.e. Okapi BM25 and against the state of the art Portfolio Theory (PT) [8]3. For PT, we tuned the parameters in each collection to maximise -ndcg@10. All the models have been implemented in C++/Lemur and code is available on request. We evaluated each model employing the diversity measures suggested in [1, 2, 3, 9].",1,TREC,True
92,"In Table 1 we report the results for the PRP (i.e. BM25), PT and a subset of the approximations we tried for the QPRP models. First of all we note that the KL based QPRP model performs the best on each collection when surrogates are used in the TREC 678 and pairwise comparisons are used on ClueWeb. These differences might be due to the limited number of topics available for the TREC 678 collection (20 in total), but also because of the different kind of documents in these collections (newswire articles vs. Web pages). Furthermore, while no significance can be calculated for the improvements on TREC 678 due to the number of topics, improvements over PRP and PT obtained on ClueWeb are statistically significant. The Pearson based QPRP consistently provides excellent retrieval performance regardless of the comparison method - and while this is not always better than the optimised PT, it is not significantly worse, and in",1,TREC,True
93,"form the surrogate. Alternative approaches might perform weighted interpolations of these vectors, in order to simulate user's memory effects (e.g. documents retrieved at early ranks are weighted less than documents at ranks close to i) or estimated importance of documents (e.g. documents ranked at early positions contribute more in generating the surrogate than lower ranked ones). 3Note, we have treated the variance of a document, 2, as a parameter of the PT model and conducted a grid search of the parameter space b (the user propensity to risk) by 2 to select the optimal run of PT on each employed collection.",0,,False
94,"fact is significantly better on several measures. It should also be noted that since the QPRP based methods do not require extensive parameter tuning like PT, the KL and Pearson instantiations of the QPRP are highly competitive, simple and attractive alternatives.",0,,False
95,4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS,0,,False
96,"In this poster we have investigated a number of strategies to approximate the interference term in the QPRP. Our results show that excellent retrieval performances can be consistently obtained when employing the Pearson based QPRP, while, the KL based QPRP provides the best subtopic retrieval performances overall. Future work will examine what type of comparison (i.e. surrogate or pairwise) should be employed given the data collection, along with incorporating other types of approximations of interference within the QPRP.",1,corpora,True
