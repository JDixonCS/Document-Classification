5,"In this paper, we define a new query expansion method that relies on term similarity metric derived from the electric resistance network. This proposed metric lets us measure the mutual relevancy in between terms and between their groups. This paper shows how to define this metric automatically from the document collection, and then apply it in query expansion for document retrieval tasks. The experiments show this method can be used to find good expansion terms of search queries and improve document retrieval performance on two TREC genomic track datasets.",1,TREC,True

9,1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
10,"A fundamental challenge of information retrieval (IR) is to find documents that are relevant to user queries. The search queries usually consists of only few terms, which barely describe the information that users request. A widely used approach to deal with this problem is to expand the original query with relevant terms [4, 5]. In this study, we tackle the query expansion problem by defining new term-similarity metric that is based on the electric resistant network. In particular, this metric is derived from the effective resistance distances in between pairs of vertices in an undirected weighted graph. In this graph, nodes represent terms and they are linked together based on their co-occurrences. The edge weights represent the strength of term co-occurrences and are interpreted as electric resistances. Based on the resistance distances between pairs of terms, we demonstrate how to derive the similarity between terms and groups of terms. In this paper, we will discuss how to build the metric from document collection and apply it in query expansion for document retrieval tasks. We then present some of the evaluation results on two TREC Genomic Track data. Finally we will conclude the paper and suggests some future work.",1,TREC,True

16,"Our objective is to define a metric in the term space that would reflect how likely the terms are to be associated (or cooccur) in the document. We define the metric with the help of a weighted graph representing direct associations among terms and their strength. More formally, our model consists of an undirected weighed graph G ,"" (V, E, w) where nodes V represent terms in the document, edges E represent pairwise association relations in between them, and weights w on the edges measure the strength of associations in between the connected pairs of nodes. In general, the association in between any two terms is calculated by considering all association paths and cumulative weights connecting them. This defines a metric on the term space.""",0,,False
