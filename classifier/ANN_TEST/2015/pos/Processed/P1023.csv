5,"Knowledge about a (Web) document's creation time has been shown to be an important factor in various temporal information retrieval settings. Commonly, it is assumed that such documents were created at a single point in time. While this assumption may hold for news articles and similar document types, it is a clear oversimplification for general Web documents. In this paper, we investigate to what extent (i) this simplifying assumption is violated for a corpus of Web documents, and, (ii) it is possible to accurately estimate the creation time of individual Web documents' components (socalled sub-documents).",0,,False

8,"Accurately estimating at what point in time a (Web) document has originally been created is of importance for a number of applications, including the tracking of ideas over time, the detection of copied content, and temporal information retrieval (IR) -- for some topics users might prefer to be served older Web documents, while for others users may prefer more recently created content. Current research in Web-document based temporal IR usually considers either the documents' creation timestamp (i.e. when the document first appeared on the Web) or the extracted content timestamps (i.e. which time periods the document contains information about) as a raw signal to be included in retrieval models [2]. In this work we focus on the creation time of Web documents. Previous work, e.g. [9, 5, 8], has made the simplifying assumption that each Web document di has been created at one moment in time ti and ti can either be approximated by the first time the document (its URL) was crawled or by the first/oldest timestamp appearing in the document content. On the Web this is a highly unrealistic assumption -- documents are constantly",1,ad,True

While the different subdocuments of a blog page may be easy to timestamp, for many other types of Web documents this is harder. Thus, in this work, we aim to arrive at a first understanding of sub-document timestamping. Specifically, we empirically investigate the following two research themes:",1,blog,True

15,We investigate a subset of documents from the ClueWeb12 corpus1 and date each document's paragraphs (a paragraph is a sub-document) individually based on historic Web crawl data collected from the Internet Archive2 (IA).,1,ClueWeb,True
16,"Having dated all sub-documents, we first analyse this corpus of sub-documents before turning towards estimating the creation time of each sub-document with a standard machine learning pipeline. We find that two thirds of the investigated Web documents (66.5%) do indeed contain sub-documents created at different points in time. More importantly, we also find a large gap between the oldest and most recently created subdocument (1052 days on average), indicating that relying on a single creation timestamp per document provides at best a very distorted picture of the true creation times. Classifying sub-documents according to their creation time using only sub-document internal features is possible with more than 66% of instances correctly classified.",0,,False

[9] improve the temporal language model by using word interpolation, temporal entropy and external search statistics. They rely on documents recorded on the IA for their experiments, with the document's creation time being the first recorded crawl within the IA. Chambers et al. [3] use machine learning to infer documents' cration timestamps based on the temporal expressions by leveraging the MaxEnt model and additional time constraints. Ge et al. [6] propose an event-based time label propagation model by using the relationship between events and documents (exploiting the fact that news articles are often about events). All these works infer a single creation time per document. In fact, most works [4, 9, 3, 6] rely on news corpora, which by design are rarely (or never) updated and usually contain an easily accessible creation timestamp.

78,"Let us first consider RT1 and the question to what extent sub-document timestamping is actually an issue on the Web. In Fig. 2 we plot the number of documents within Draerlchived and the number of different timestamps we assigned to their respective sub-documents. Overall, 62.5% of documents have between 2 and 8 creation timestamps; very few documents contain content created at eight or more different times (4%). Since not only the number of different creation timestamps a document possesses, but also the time interval between the timestamps is important, in Fig. 3 we present the average difference (in days) between the oldest and most recent creation timestamp of a document, with the document set partitioned according to the total number of creation timestamps found in a document. For documents with two creation timestamps, the median difference is 400 days, i.e. 50% of those documents contain content created more than one year apart. Considering these numbers we next investigate how much content is created at different points in time. For each document di ,"" {s1,i, s2,i, .., sk,i}  Draerlchived with 2, 3 or 4 creation timestamps we determined what fraction of document content was created when. The results are shown in Fig. 4.
