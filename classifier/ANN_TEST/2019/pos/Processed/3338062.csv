7,"We improve the measurement accuracy of retrieval system performance by better modeling the noise present in test collection scores. Our technique draws its inspiration from two approaches: one, which exploits the variable measurement accuracy of topics; the other, which randomly splits document collections into shards. We describe and theoretically analyze an ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) model able to capture the effects of topics, systems, and document shards as well as their interactions. Using multiple TREC collections, we empirically confirm theoretical results in terms of improved estimation accuracy and robustness of found significant differences. The improvements compared to widely used test collection measurement techniques are substantial. We speculate that our technique works because we do not assume that the topics of a test collection measure performance equally.",1,TREC,True

14,Measuring the difference in performance between two Information Retrieval (IR) systems using an offline test collection has long been recognized as noisy.

20,"Robertson and Kanoulas [26] pointed out a common assumption in the use of test collections namely ""all topics are considered equally valuable"". They examined this assumption by measuring (via bootstrapping) the confidence intervals of each topic score and of each system. The intervals were found to be variable across topics but largely independent of system. The researchers concluded that some topics measure performance more accurately than others.",0,,False
21,"Ferro and Sanderson [11] examined splitting the documents of a test collection into shards, measuring the performance of systems on each shard. They used an ANOVA model to understand if system performance changed across shards. The authors mentioned that significant differences between systems on sharded collections were more common than on unsharded. However, the reasons for the result was not explored as the experiment was designed to address a different research question. Voorhees et al. [39] randomly split a collection in half. The authors stated that the two resulting shards allowed more accurate performance measurement. However, it was reported that splitting the collection further did not improve accuracy; reasons for no improvement were not examined in detail.",1,ad,True
22,We describe research that takes the Robertson and Kanoulas view that topics have unequal value and combines it with the ANOVA approach of Ferro and Sanderson [11] and the sharding method of Voorhees et al. [39]. We ask: Can the unequal value of topics be exploited to improve measurement of system performance accuracy on a test collection? We make the following contributions:,0,,False

34,"arithmetic mean of topics scores. Swanson [33] described such a process in 1960. When the mean is taken, each topic score contributes equally regardless of the accuracy of that measure. The potential for error was described by Voorhees [36]: ""When [topics] have very few relevant documents (fewer than five or so), summary evaluation measures such as average precision are themselves unstable; tests that include many such queries are more variable"". Soboroff [32] pointed out that rank cut off evaluation measures (e.g. precision at 10) will have an upper bound < 1 for topics with few relevant documents.",0,,False
35,"The notion that not all topics have equal value was implicitly exploited in work identifying a subset of test collection topics that rank systems similarly to a full topic set [13, 19]. To the best of our knowledge, however, Cormack and Lynam [9] were the first to incorporate an unequal view of topics into test collection measurement. They treated each topic as a ""separate test"", calculating topic confidence intervals using a bootstrap approach. Topics with  5 relevant documents were subject to a ""Small-R Correction"" to overcome measurement instability.",1,corpora,True
36,"Robertson [25] considered the broader question of what is the ""per-topic noise or error"" present in the topics of a test collection. The paper considered if evaluation measures could be adapted to cope with an unequal view of topics. Later, Robertson and Kanoulas [26] measured the variance of topic scores by bootstrapping from the document collection. The researchers found that topics showed different levels of variance, but the variance was relatively consistent across systems. The researchers described a significance test that incorporated topic score variation. Comparisons between the new test and the commonly used t-test showed some differences in the conclusions one might draw when comparing systems.",1,ad,True
37,"More recently, Yang et al. [41] examined how much rankings of systems were affected by per-topic score variance and if there was any impact on significance tests.

40,"ANOVA can decompose the data of an IR experiment into a model of factors, into interactions between those factors, and into a level of unmodeled error. Tague-Sutcliffe and Blustein [34] described an example of this approach by comparing the variation in performance across two factors: topics and systems. The former was found to be larger than the latter. Measurement of interaction between topics and systems was not possible owing to a lack of replicates of topic*system measures. Banks et al. [2] approximated such an interaction, suggesting it would be strong and significant. Later, Bodoff and Li [3] used a test collection with multiple relevance assessments to obtain the required replicates. The authors reported that the magnitude of the topic*system interaction factor was less than the topic factor, but greater than the system factor.",0,,False

43,"Voorhees et al. [39] used a bootstrap ANOVA approach that drew on a sample of the scores of topics measured across different systems and shards. The researchers tested on the TREC-3, TREC-8, and 2006 Terabyte track collections. Success of the approach was measured by counting the number of significant differences found between systems submitted to TREC tracks. The researchers found substantially more such differences were measured than with conventional approaches. Two shards were used. When three or five shards were tried, the researchers found the number of significant differences dropped, the reasons for which were not examined in detail. The relative impact of each component of the technique ­ bootstrap ANOVA, the approach to multiple comparisons, and sharding method ­ was not described.",1,TREC,True
44,"As part of a study on the interaction between different types of shards and system scores, Ferro and Sanderson [11] described a series of ANOVA models tested on the TREC-7 and TREC-8 adhoc test collections. Like the previous research, the value of these models was quantified by the number of significant differences measured between systems. The researchers showed that a more sophisticated ANOVA model produced the highest number of significant differences measured between systems. However, the shards were very skewed in size.",1,TREC,True
45,"The research described shows that the topics of test collections can produce scores of different variance, which can impact the measurement of significance between systems. There is, as yet, not an extensive body of research examining such topic variability. Most work has explored bootstrap approaches from document collections to assess the variance. The recent examination of sharding has not been explored in conjunction with the work on topic variability. We explore the connection between these two lines of inquiry examining the style of ANOVA modeling used by Ferro and Sanderson [11].

103,"How does model (MD6) exploit the variable measurement of topics? With random even sized shards, the probability of having relevant documents in a shard is uniform across the shards. This probability is smaller for topics with fewer relevant documents and greater for topics with more relevant documents. Therefore, for each topic, the number of shards without any relevant documents is proportional to the number of relevant documents for that topic. Model (MD6) accounts for this by explicitly considering ( )ik , i.e. the topic*shard interaction effect. When there are no relevant documents for a topic on a given shard, we set the score to undefined for all the systems with respect to that topic on that shard. The more shards without relevant documents for a topic, the more undefined values there are, which is reflected in the estimation of the ( )ik factor. Therefore, the estimation of the SS of the topic*shard interaction factor directly removes from the total SS the variability due to these intrinsic differences among topics, reducing the error SS and giving us the possibility of a more accurate estimation of the differences among systems. Instead of seeing shards as a mere ""technical trick"" to obtain replicates, we can look at them as a form of ""diagnostic tool"", which allows us to systematically probe measurement differences across topics and to account for the differences in a model.",1,ad,True

More complex models are less sensitive to the increase in the number of shards, since they detect almost all the significantly different pairs already at a low number of shards.

This suggest that the RoS is quite stable and does not depend much on the specific random shards. Similar considerations hold also in the case of the Tukey confidence interval, which gets smaller has the shard size increases and whose values are similar across shard samples. This suggests that the detection of significantly different systems is not affected much by the specific random shards at hand.",1,AP,True
