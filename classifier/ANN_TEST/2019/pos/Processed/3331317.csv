8,"Although considerable attention has been given to neural ranking architectures recently, far less attention has been paid to the term representations that are used as input to these models. In this work, we investigate how two pretrained contextualized language models (ELMo and BERT) can be utilized for ad-hoc document ranking. Through experiments on Trec benchmarks, we find that several existing neural ranking architectures can benefit from the additional context provided by contextualized language models. Furthermore, we propose a joint approach that incorporates BERT's classification vector into existing neural models and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art ad-hoc ranking baselines. We call this joint approach CEDR (Contextualized Embeddings for Document Ranking). We also address practical challenges in using these models for ranking, including the maximum input length imposed by BERT and runtime performance impacts of contextualized language models.",1,LM,True

11,"Recently, there has been much work designing ranking architectures to effectively score query-document pairs, with encouraging results [5, 6, 20]. Meanwhile, pretrained contextualized language models (such as ELMo [16] and BERT [4]) have shown great promise on various natural language processing tasks [4, 16]. These models work by pre-training LSTM-based or transformer-based [19] language models on a large corpus, and then by performing minimal task fine-tuning (akin to ImageNet [3, 23]).",1,LM,True

19,"We propose incorporating contextualized language models into existing neural ranking architectures by using multiple similarity matrices ­ one for each layer of the language model. We find that, at the expense of computation costs, this improves ranking performance considerably, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Robust 2004 and WebTrack 2012­2014 datasets. We also show that combining each model with BERT's classification mechanism can further improve ranking performance. We call this approach CEDR (Contextualzed Embeddings for Document Ranking). Finally, we show that the computation costs of contextualized language models can be dampened by only partially computing the contextualized language model representations.

31,"Pretrained contextual language representations (such as those from ELMo [16] and BERT [4]) are context sensitive; in contrast to more conventional pretrained word vectors (e.g., GloVe [15]) that generate a single word representation for each word in the vocabulary, these models generate a representation of each word based on its context in the sentence. For example, the contextualized representation of word bank would be different in bank deposit and river bank, while a pretrained word embedding model would always result in the same representation for this term. Given that these representations capture contextual information in the language, we investigate how these models can also benefit general neural ranking models.",1,LM,True
32,"Although contextualized language models vary in particular architectures, they typically consist of multiple stacked layers of representations (e.g., recurrent or transformer outputs). The intuition is that the deeper the layer, the more context is incorporated. To allow neural ranking models to learn which levels are most important, we choose to incorporate the output of all layers into the model, resulting in a three-dimensional similarity representation. Thus, we expand the similarity representation (conditioned on the query and document context) to SQ,D  RL×|Q |×|D | where L is the number of layers in the model, akin to the channel in image processing.

Note that when q and d are identical, they will likely not receive a similarity score of 1, as their representation depends on the surrounding context of the query and document. The layer dimension can be easily incorporated into existing neural models. For instance, soft n-gram based models, like PACRR, can perform convolutions with multiple input channels, and counting-based methods (like KNRM and DRMM) can count each channel individually.",1,corpora,True

36,"Unlike ELMo, the BERT model encodes multiple text segments simultaneously, allowing it to make judgments about text pairs. It accomplishes this by encoding two meta-tokens ([SEP] and [CLS]) and using text segment embeddings (Segment A and Segment B). The [SEP] token separates the tokens of each segment, and the [CLS] token is used for making judgments about the text pairs. During training, [CLS] is used for predicting whether two sentences are sequential ­ that is, whether Segment A immediately precedes Segment B in the original text. The representation of this token can be fine-tuned for other tasks involving multiple text segments, including natural language entailment and question answering [22].",1,LM,True
37,We explore incorporating the [CLS] token's representation into existing neural ranking models as a joint approach. This allows neural rankers to benefit from deep semantic information from BERT in addition to individual contextualized token matches.,1,corpora,True
38,"Incorporating the [CLS] token into existing ranking models is straightforward. First, the given ranking model produces relevance scores (e.g., n-gram or kernel scores) for each query term based on the similarity matrices. Then, for models using dense combination (e.g., PACRR, KNRM), we propose concatenating the [CLS] vector to the model's signals. For models that sum query term scores (e.g., DRMM), we include the [CLS] vector in the dense calculation of each term score (i.e., during combination of bin scores).",1,corpora,True
39,"We hypothesize that this approach will work because the BERT classification mechanism and existing rankers have different strengths.

This indicates that fine-tuning contextualized language models for ranking is important. This boost is further enhanced when using the CEDR (joint) approach, with the CEDR models always outperforming Vanilla BERT [V], and nearly always significantly outperforming the non-CEDR versions [N].

In an attempt to improve the running time of these systems, we propose limiting the number of layers processed by the model. The reasoning behind this approach is that the lower the layer, the more abstract the matching becomes, perhaps becoming less useful for ranking. We show the runtime and ranking performance of PACRR when only processing only up to a given layer in Figure 2(b). It shows that most of the performance benefits can be achieved by only running BERT through layer 5; the performance is comparable to running the full BERT model, while running more than twice as fast. While we acknowledge that our research code is not completely optimized, we argue that this approach is generally applicable because the processing of these layers are sequential, query-dependent, and dominate the processing time of the entire model.
