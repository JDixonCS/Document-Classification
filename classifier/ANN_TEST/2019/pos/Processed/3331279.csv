23,1 INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
24,"Topic diculty, dened as the average eectiveness of a set of systems on a topic [9, 10], is a well-studied problem in the IR literature. It is loosely related to the problem of Query Performance Prediction (QPP), which aims to estimate the eectiveness of a system for a given query when no relevance judgments are available [2]. In classical QPP, however, the aim is to predict the performance of a specic system for a specic query; in this paper we study topic diculty for a set of systems. This is a dierent problem that can be justied by the aim of understanding the ""general"" diculty of a topic [7≠10]. It also leads naturally to the research issue of nding representative sets of systems, i.e., sets for which diculty would generalize to other sets. Our overall goal is to understand the eect of three factors (the set of systems, the document corpus, and the system components) on topic diculty. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has only been investigated from a system eectiveness perspective. We achieve this goal by extending factor analysis methods recently proposed to study the eect of system components on eectiveness of systems [4≠6]. We address four research questions:",1,Query,True

30,"A body of related work focuses on studying factors that aect system eectiveness, such as topic composition, collection, and system components. Sanderson et al. [11] investigated the eect of splitting a TREC collection into sub-collections based on system eectiveness, and identied several interesting sub-collection effects induced by the splits. Banks et al. [1] provided an overview of methods that can be applied to analyze the performance of IR systems on TREC collections and its relation to topics, collections and other factors. One common statistical tool used for this problem is the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), which was recently used by Ferro and Silvello [5] to compare combinations of collections, metrics, and systems. They showed that stop lists, IR models, and component interactions have a signicant but small eect on overall system eectiveness. The same approach was adopted by Ferro and Sanderson [4] and Ferro et al. [3], whose experiments show the existence of a signicant sub-corpus eect relative to system eectiveness; however, the eect is smaller than both system and topic eects, with topic eect being the most signicant. Similar experiments using the sub-corpora of a single collection showed that the system eect is smaller than the topic eect [4]. However, none of these studies specically addresses the eect of factors on topic diculty which we study here. Moreover, all of them compare sub-corpora of the same collection, which has some drawbacks. TREC corpora are built with a ""working assumption"" that they are somehow complete, and working on sub-corpora can sometimes negate this assumption. In this paper, we do not only analyze what happens on incomplete sub-corpora, but we are also able to compare across dierent corpora.",1,TREC,True

278,"RQ2: Corpora Eects. We now turn to the eect of document corpora on topic diculty. In Figure 2, we see that the correlation between AAP values of R04 and C17 is 0.48 for ocial systems (1st row, 1st column), and 0.38 for unocial ones (2nd row, 1st column). It is somewhat higher for ocial systems, although they dier across collections whereas the unocial congurations are identical. Similar results are observed when selecting a particular subset of systems (columns 2-4). In contrast, the correlations between R04 and TREC6 are very high: 0.84 when computed over ocial systems (3rd row, 1st column), and 0.95 when computed over unocial systems (4th row, 1st column). Also in this case, selecting a subset of systems does not seem to aect correlations. We obtained the same results for TREC7-8 (not shown here).",1,corpora,True

RQ3: System Component Eects. We now turn to our third research question, which focuses on the impact of system components on topic diculty; in particular, we consider stemming and query expansion. Since these are quite dramatic changes to the systems, we expect quite signicant changes to AAP values, and probably low correlations.

For many of the topics, stemming leads to little or no signicant improvement in terms of AAP. In a few cases, however, there are signicant increases and decreases in AAP, which occur for the same topics across dierent stemmers. The highest dierences in AAP was observed for the R04 topics (see the 1st row), which appear to be quite sensitive to the stemmer used.",1,ad,True

However, the correlations, shown in Figures 4 and 5, are quite high: somehow unexpectedly, relative topic diculty remains quite stable despite the changes to the systems (stemming or query expansion) are quite signicant. RQ4: Comparing relative eects with ANOVA. In an attempt to provide a more principled and, at the same time, concise analysis, we investigate the eects of systems, corpora, and system components using ANOVA as part of our nal research question. In particular, we dene two ANOVA models (see Equations (1) and (2)), which are described below. Tables 4 and 5 show the outcome of each ANOVA test. For each factor, we report the Sum of Squares (SS), the Degrees of Freedom (DF), the F statistics, the p-value, and the eect-size ( 2) which quanties the proportional variance of each factor [4≠6]. The rst model decomposes the eectiveness (measured by AP) into system, topic, and corpus eects:",1,corpora,True

Table 4 shows the results of the ANOVA analysis for Eq. (1). All eects are statistically signicant. Systems have a small eect (0.0103), while topics have the greatest eect (0.6603). The interaction eect between corpus and topic is also large but, perhaps surprisingly, both the relative eect of the corpus, and the interaction between corpus and system is negligible.

(2) are shown in Table 5. All eects are statistically signicant, and the topic eect is the largest (0.8157); the system eect is signicant but small. Again, somewhat surprisingly, the corpus interactions have a negligible eect on AP scores. All other eects are not signicant. In summary, the ANOVA analyses show that AP scores are aected mostly by topics and systems, with the greatest eects being attributable to the topic eect; furthermore, system components, corpus, and the interaction between corpus and systems have very little eect on AP. Nevertheless, the impact of topics on AP clearly varies based on the corpus.",1,AP,True

346,"This is the rst study that specically addresses topic diculty in a systematic way: we use dierent corpora, not just sub-corpora; we run the same set of systems across dierent datasets; and we rely on datasets featuring common topics. To do so, we exploit the topic overlap between C17 and R04 with previous collections, and we supplement our analysis using a comprehensive set of unocial but reproducible systems.",1,ad,True
