10,"The limited availability of ground truth relevance labels has been a major impediment to the application of supervised methods to ad-hoc retrieval. As a result, unsupervised scoring methods, such as BM25, remain strong competitors to deep learning techniques which have brought on dramatic improvements in other domains, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Recent works have shown that it is possible to take advantage of the performance of these unsupervised methods to generate training data for learning-to-rank models. The key limitation to this line of work is the size of the training set required to surpass the performance of the original unsupervised method, which can be as large as 1013 training examples. Building on these insights, we propose two methods to reduce the amount of training data required. The first method takes inspiration from crowdsourcing, and leverages multiple unsupervised rankers to generate soft, or noise-aware, training labels. The second identifies harmful, or mislabeled, training examples and removes them from the training set. We show that our methods allow us to surpass the performance of the unsupervised baseline with far fewer training examples than previous works.",null,null

24,"In [7], Dehghani et al. show that the output of an unsupervised document retrieval method can be used to train a supervised ranking model that outperforms the original unsupervised ranker. More recently, [13] proposed a hierarchical interaction based model that is trained on a similarly generated training set. These works have shown the potential of leveraging unsupervised methods as sources of weak supervision for the retrieval task. However, they require training on as many as 1013 training examples to surpass the performance of the unsupervised baseline [7, 13].",null,null
,,,
25,"In this work, we substantially reduce this number by making more effective use of the generated training data. We present two methods that make improvements in this direction, and beat the unsupervised method using fewer than 10% of the training rankings compared to previous techniques.",null,null
,,,
26,"In the first method, we take a crowdsourcing approach and collect the output of multiple unsupervised retrieval models. Following [19], we learn a joint distribution over the outputs of said retrieval models and generate a new training set of soft labels. We call this the noise-aware model. The noise-aware model does not require access to any gold labels1.",null,null

28,2 RELATED WORK,null,null
,,,
29,"Much of the prior work in handling noisy datasets has been in the context of a classifier from noisy labels. In the binary classification context, noise is seen as a class-conditional probability that an observed label is the opposite of the true label [8, 14]. In the ranking context, we typically expect that models trained using pairwise or listwise loss functions will far outperform pointwise approaches [11]. Since the label of a pair is determined by the ordering of the documents within the pair, it is not immediately obvious how the class-conditional flip probabilities translate to this formulation. The relationship to listwise objectives is not straightforward either.",null,null

38,"In [5] and [6], Dehghani et al. introduce two semi-supervised student-teacher models where the teacher weights the contribution of each sample in the student model's training loss based on its confidence in the quality of the label. They train the teacher on a small subset of gold labels and use the model's output as confidence weights for the student model. [5] shows that using this approach, they can beat the unsupervised ranker using ~75% of the data required when training directly on the noisy data. They train a cluster of 50 gaussian processes to form the teacher annotations which are used to generate soft labels to fine-tune the student model.",null,null

39,"In [19], Ratner et al. transform a set of weak supervision sources, that may disagree with each other, into soft labels used to train a discriminative model. They show experimentally that this approach outperforms the naïve majority voting strategy for generating the target labels. This inspires our noise-aware approach.",null,null
,,,
40,"In [10], Koh et al. apply classical results from regression analysis to approximate the change in loss at a test point caused by removing a specific point from the training set. They show experimentally that their method approximates this change in loss well, even for highly non-linear models, such as GoogLeNet. They also apply their method to prioritize training examples to check for labeling errors. Our influence-aware approach uses influence functions [10] to identify mislabeled training examples.",null,null

315,"We have presented two approaches to reduce the amount of weak data needed to surpass the performance of the unsupervised method that generates the training data. The noise-aware model does not require ground truth labels, but has an additional data dependency on multiple unsupervised rankers. The influence-aware model requires a small set of gold-labels in addition to a re-train of the model,",null,null
