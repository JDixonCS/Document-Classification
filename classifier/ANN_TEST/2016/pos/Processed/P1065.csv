5,"This work takes an in-depth look at the factors that affect manual classifications of ""temporally sensitive"" information needs. We use qualitative and quantitative techniques to analyze 660 topics from the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) previously used in the experimental evaluation of temporal retrieval models. Regression analysis is used to identify factors in previous manual classifications. We explore potential problems with the previous classifications, considering principles and guidelines for future work on temporal retrieval models.",1,TREC,True
6,1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
7,"A growing body of information retrieval research argues that temporality should be modeled explicitly when scoring and ranking documents with respect to users' queries. Researchers have explored a variety of temporal retrieval models that explicitly incorporate time into document ranking [7, 2, 1]. They refer to general classes of ""temporal queries"" or ""temporal information needs."" Models have been proposed for ""recency queries"" [7, 2], ""time-sensitive queries"" [1], ""implicitly temporal queries"" [8], and ""temporally biased queries"" [5]. For evaluation, these studies rely on manual classifications of topics into temporal categories.",1,corpora,True
8,"In this short paper, we take a deeper look into these manually classified topics to develop a clear understanding of what makes a query temporally sensitive? Previous manual classifications combine the temporal distribution of judged-relevant documents with common-sense notions of topic temporality without a clear explanation of the criteria or processes used in classification. If we cannot explain the processes being modeled, use of these manually classified topics for evaluation is of limited value.",0,,False

33,"Jones and Diaz [5] define three classes of queries based on the manual analysis of topics: temporally ambiguous (requesting multiple events), temporally unambiguous (requesting a single event), and atemporal (having no preference). Jones and Diaz manually classify 100 TREC topics based only on their title, description, and narrative fields.

39,3. WHAT MAKES A QUERY TEMPORALLY SENSITIVE?,0,,False
40,"Given the complex landscape described in the previous section, what in general makes a query temporally sensitive? Dakka et al [1] present a compelling definition. A query is temporally sensitive if ""the relevant documents for the query are not spread uniformly over time, but rather tend to be concentrated at restricted intervals."" This is an essential point, since many temporal retrieval models rely on the temporal distribution of results in document scoring. This is also why we do not include the topics developed for the NTCIR Temporalia test collections [4]: they are primarily concerned with temporal topicality, i.e. queries about a certain time, in contrast to our focus on temporal sensitivity, which relates to the unequal occurrence of relevant documents at certain points in time. Still, the distribution of relevant documents alone is not sufficient to determine true temporality. To address this, most of the studies listed above rely on common-sense notions of temporality based on the topic content considered independently of the distribution of relevant documents. A primary goal of the current study is to look deeper into these common-sense criteria with the aim of providing researchers a firmer basis for assessing which queries are likely to have a temporal dimension.",1,ad,True

Each coder reviewed the relevant document distribution along with the total number of relevant documents for each topic and assigned one of four values based on subjective impressions about the degreee to which relevant documents were temporally constrained: too few observations (-1), low or no temporality (0), moderate temporality (1), and high temporality (2).",1,ad,True

71,"Our qualitative analysis suggests that three broad classes of features bear on query temporality: events, named entities, and explicit dates. It is intuitive that topics focused on specific and important events will have a higher degree of temporal relevance. Following the Topic Detection and Tracking definition, seminal events happen at specific times in specific places, often to individuals or other named entities (e.g., organizations). Perhaps the most essential code is the ""SpecificEvent"" ­ something important that happens at a particular time and place. Related to SpecificEvent is the ""PeriodicEvent,"" which refers to an event that recurs periodically, such as the Super Bowl, World Cup, or Halloween. Jones and Diaz [5] note that many of the early adhoc queries were temporally ambiguous, referring to multiple events. We incorporate this concept through the ""GenericEvent"" code, which captures topics concerned with a class of specific events, such as earthquakes, elections, or strikes. While analyzing topics, it became apparent that some topics were likely to be inspired by a specific event, but without explicit reference in the topic description. This concept is captured through the ""IndirectEventReference"" code. The remaining codes are concerned with the identification of specific types of named entities, which are expected to have some association with topic temporality, and explicit dates.",1,ad,True

We have attempted to model these classifications by proposing features believed to indicate temporality. Features include the presence of different types of named entities, classes of events, and measures of the temporal distribution of judged relevant documents.",1,TREC,True
131,"We were successful in modeling the ""event"" category in the Novelty track, based primarily on our ""SpecificEvent"" code. Event codes were also found to be useful predictors of the classification of Peetz et al [9]. However, we were generally unable to identify characteristics that fully explain the other manual classifications. They seem to consistently conflate two different concepts: the temporal distribution of judged-relevant documents and common-sense notions of topic temporality.",1,Novelty,True
132,"Since the first-order autocorrelation of the judged-relevant document distribution is highly correlated with manual judgements of temporality, we recommend using the ACF or other measure of distribution ""burstiness"" instead of manual assessment. In the future, common-sense notions of temporality should be clearly explicated.",1,ad,True
133,"If we cannot explain the process that determines the classifications, it raises questions about the value of these test collections for evaluation. Specifically, how can we be clear that the queries previously identified as ""temporally sensitive"" are truly so? This ambiguity also limits the utility of previous research, since it is unclear how to select queries for which the proposed models are well-suited.",0,,False
