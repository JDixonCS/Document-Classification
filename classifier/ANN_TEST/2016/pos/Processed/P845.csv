8,"First Story Detection (FSD) systems aim to identify those news articles that discuss an event that was not reported before. Recent work on FSD has focussed almost exclusively on efficiently detecting documents that are dissimilar from their nearest neighbor. We propose a novel FSD approach that is more effective, by adapting a recently proposed method for news summarization based on 3-nearest neighbor clustering. We show that this approach is more effective than a baseline that uses dissimilarity of an individual document from its nearest neighbor.",1,ad,True

10,"Internet users are turning more frequently to online news as a replacement for traditional media sources such as newspapers or television. For the user, the news stream is a source to both track topics of interest and to become informed about important new events the user was not yet aware of. Automated detection of new events can save to user a great deal of time, for instance by notifying users about new events, which is especially interesting to users and organizations for whom the information is time-critical and who need to act on that information.",1,ad,True
11,"FSD systems aim to identify those news articles that discuss an event that was not reported before in earlier stories, without knowledge of what events will happen in the news [2]. Recently, FSD has been suggested as a useful tool to monitor the Twitter feed [7], and while previous work has addressed the efficiency that is required for this purpose, there has been little work on improving the effectiveness in over a decade [7, 8].",1,Twitter,True

19,"FSD has been recognized as the most difficult task in the research area of TDT [11]. In early work, Allen et al. detect first stories as news articles whose cosine similarity over tf-idf vectors to its nearest neighbor is less than a threshold, an effective approach that outperforms complex language model approaches in most cases [1]. This baseline is still used for FSD in recent work, in which more focus is put on efficiency than to improve effectiveness [3, 5, 4].",1,TD,True
20,"Papka and Allen, argue that a side-effect of the timely nature of broadcast news is that stories closer together on the news stream are more likely to discuss related topics than stories farther apart on the stream. When a significant new event occurs, there are usually several stories per day discussing it; over time, coverage of old events is displaced by more recent events. They use temporal proximity as a distinguishing feature to incorporate the salient properties of broadcast news [2, 6].",1,ad,True
21,"In recent work, Vuurens et al. proposed a novel 3-nearest neighbor clustering (3NN) approach to retrieve sentences from news articles that contain novel and useful news facts. In this approach every text is linked to its three nearest neighbors that must be from a different domain [10]. The so-called `2-degenerate cores' constructed by the algorithm correspond to highly similar texts from three different sources. Their existence indicates the importance or salience of the information contained. Temporal proximity is incorporated in the model by weighting the time between news articles in the similarity function used. In [9] normalized information gain is shown to be more effective than cosine similarity for the task of clustering news articles that are topically related.",1,corpora,True

32,"In this study, we propose a novel approach that is based on 3nearest neighbor clustering (3NN), using the existing open source implementation [10]. In 3NN clustering, every node is assigned to its three nearest neighbors, not allowing links between nodes from the same news domain, and based on temporal proximity between publication dates which allows the clustering to be continuously updated in near real-time. 2-generate cluster cores are formed when three nodes each link to the other two as a one of its 3 nearest neighbors. These clusters contain information that is locally most central and therefore likely to be salient information [10]. The key idea for First Story Detection, is that acting on formed 3NN clusters rather than individual documents is less likely to return false positives. However, instead of truly detecting the first story as was the objective in the TDT program, here we aim to improve detection performance at the expense of slightly delayed detection. It may also be that the story detected as the first of a new event is more central to the information, and therefore more suitable as a seed to start tracking a topic, however, this hypothesis is outside the scope of this study and left for future work.",1,ad,True
33,"In [9], news sentences were fitted into a hierarchy that distinguishes between different events and topics by forming clusters of topically related the news articles, for which normalized information gain was shown to be more effective than cosine similarity. Therefore, to promote 3NN clusters to be formed around topically related news articles we use a similarity function based on normalized information gain. In Equation 2, the normalized information gain between two documents d and d results in a score of 0 between identical documents and a score of 1 between disjoint documents, by dividing the information gain IG between the documents by an upper bound of the information gain IGmax that would be obtained if these documents have the same internal distributions over terms but are completely disjoint. For the remainder of this paper we use IGsim as defined in Equation 3 as a similarity function between two documents d, d based on IGnorm.",0,,False

Similar to the Single Linkage baseline, first stories are detected when a newly formed cluster core is dissimilar from news articles seen recently. In 3NN every news article is linked to its three nearest neighbors, therefore the members of a newly formed 2-degenerate core that contains a first story each have two links to the other core members and the third link links to a dissimilar news article. The most similar non-core news article that a core member links to, is then used to estimate the novelty of that cluster core.
