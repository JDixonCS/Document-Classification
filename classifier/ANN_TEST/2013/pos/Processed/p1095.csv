5,"Twitter is currently one of the largest social hubs for users to spread and discuss news. For most of the top news stories happening, there are corresponding discussions on social media. In this demonstration TweetMogaz is presented, which is a platform for microblog search and filtering. It creates a real-time comprehensive report about what people discuss and share around news happening in certain regions. TweetMogaz reports the most popular tweets, jokes, videos, images, and news articles that people share about top news stories. Moreover, it allows users to search for specific topics. A scalable automatic technique for microblog filtering is used to obtain relevant tweets to a certain news category in a region. TweetMogaz.com demonstrates the effectiveness of our filtering technique for reporting public response toward news in different Arabic regions including Egypt and Syria in real-time.",1,Twitter,True

10,1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
11,"Microblogging sites, such as Twitter, are currently one of the main platforms for exchanging real-time information and discussions. In fact, Twitter and Facebook were instrumental in facilitating the launch of the so-called ""Arab Spring"". This large amount of information led to the need for an effective platform for information filtering, to allow only relevant information reaches users. The currently implemented and straightforward microblog filtering technique on Twitter is the ""follow"" feature. This allows users to follow other accounts of entities, persons, or events to be fed with their tweets. This method is personalized according to user's interest. Another method for following specific micrblogs on Twitter is searching for given hashtags (#tags), which is a common way for users to get updates about some topics based on the mention of the hashtag within tweets text. This method is less strict in filtering information, where more tweets are generally presented to user. However, many unneeded tweets would be retrieved because of the misusage of hashtags by some users. Additionally, many relevant tweets to a hashtag topic may not include the hashtag itself, which leads to their absence in the retrieved results.",1,blog,True

13,"In this demonstration we present a news portal website, TweetMogaz, which is generated from tweets. TweetMogaz presents the most popular content people share on Twitter regarding the ongoing news in different regions. Visitors of the website can see a comprehensive report of the most popular tweets, jokes, videos, images, and news articles that people share on Twitter related to the top news stories of the day. Standard news sites give their visitors an idea about what is happening in given regions, while TweetMogaz gives visitors an idea about what are the topics in news that people are interested in, and how they react towards them. In addition, it captures additional aspects of news stories shared on social media that may not exist in the news sites.",1,Tweet,True
14,"TweetMogaz applies microblog filtering technique for retrieving tweets. A set of key players in news for a certain region are manually listed, and one or multiple news sites for the same region are set to our system. Potential relevant tweets to news are retrieved; then a relevance classification technique is used to identify the relevant tweets and discard the rest. Classified relevant tweets are then used to generate comprehensive report with most popular content people share as in [3]. Information on website is updated every 15 minutes to keep following fresh news and their response on social media.",1,Tweet,True
15,"Our approach for retrieving and filtering relevant tweets shows high performance. The approach is applied to follow political news in counties in the Arabic region such as the Egypt and Syria. However, it is potentially applicable to different regions and different news categories. The only requirement is preparing a list of key players of a news category in a given region and setting a regional news site.",0,,False

17,"Previous work in Microblog retrieval focused on analyzing the search process [4, 8], improving ad-hoc microblog search [6], and developing platforms for improved user experience with search through analyzing results [3, 9]. Additional work studied the role of micrblogs in news reporting and discovery, and how users' profiles can be used for news recommendation [5, 7]. Other work investigated detecting comments about news from Twitter to be presented to readers along with news articles [2].",1,blog,True
18,"Recently, microblog filtering grabbed some attention as an important task for allowing users to follow certain topics. Microblog filtering was introduced as a new task in TREC Microblog track 2012, where the aim was to filter a feed of tweets by getting relevant ones to some topics. The best achieved result in the track got a precision of 0.6, which is considerably low for usage in a practical environment [6].",1,blog,True
19,"Our system presented in this demonstration applies microblog filtering [6] for getting tweets relevant to regional news [5, 7] in a practical environment with high precision.

98,"TweetMogaz is running over a collection of Arabic tweets. It collects an average of 3-4 million Arabic tweets per day since May 2012. Tweets text is pre-processed using state-of-the-art normalization techniques for social Arabic text [1] and indexed using Solr. Search is enabled by specifying a query and time span, and results are presented in a comprehensive report similar to work in [3]. The homepage of TweetMogaz displays a real-time report about political news in the past 24 hours for countries in the Arabic region including Egypt and Syria. Tens of thousands of tweets are identified daily as relevant to each region using the presented filtering approach. The number of relevant tweets can reach up to 300k tweets on days with hot news, such as the Egyptian presidential elections day, and the days when there are severe battles between the Syrian free army and the regime's army. User can see examples of these days by browsing archived daily reports on the website.",1,Tweet,True
