7,"Real-time push noti cation systems monitor continuous document streams such as social media posts and alert users to relevant content directly on their mobile devices. We describe a user study of such systems in the context of the TREC 2016 Real-Time Summarization Track, where system updates are immediately delivered as push noti cations to the mobile devices of a cohort of users. Our study represents, to our knowledge, the rst deployment of an interleaved evaluation framework for prospective information needs, and also provides an opportunity to examine user behavior in a realistic se ing. Results of our online in-situ evaluation are correlated against the results a more traditional post-hoc batch evaluation. We observe substantial correlations between many online and batch evaluation metrics, especially for those that share the same basic design (e.g., are utility-based). For some metrics, we observe li le correlation, but are able to identify the volume of messages that a system pushes as one major source of di erences.",1,TREC,True

9,"ere is growing interest in systems that address prospective information needs against continuous document streams, exempli ed by social media services such as Twi er. We might imagine a user having some number of ""interest pro les"" representing prospective information needs, and the system's task is to automatically monitor the stream of documents to keep the user up to date on topics of interest. For example, a journalist might be interested in collisions involving autonomous vehicles and wishes to receive updates whenever such an event occurs. Although there are a number of ways such updates can be delivered, we consider the case where they are immediately pushed to the user's mobile device as noti cations. At a high level, these push noti cations must be relevant, novel, and timely.",1,ad,True

24,2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK,0,,False
25,"Work on prospective information needs against document streams dates back at least a few decades and is closely related to ad hoc document retrieval [6]. Major initiatives in the 1990s include the TREC Filtering Tracks, which ran from 1995 [13] to 2002 [21], and the research program commonly known as topic detection and tracking (TDT) [2]. e TREC Filtering Tracks are best understood as binary classi cation on every document in the collection with respect to standing queries, and TDT is similarly concerned with identifying all documents related to a particular event--with an intelligence analyst in mind. In contrast, we are focused on identifying a small set of the most relevant updates to deliver to users--any more than a handful of noti cations per day would surely be annoying. Furthermore, in both TREC Filtering and TDT, systems must make online decisions as soon as documents arrive. In the case of push noti cations, systems can choose to push older content, thus giving rise to the possibility of algorithms operating on bounded bu ers. Latency is one aspect of the evaluation, allowing systems to trade o output quality with timeliness.",1,ad,True
26,"More recently, Guo et al. [8] introduced the temporal summarization task, whose goal is to generate concise update summaries from news sources about unexpected events as they develop. is has been operationalized in the TREC Temporal Summarization (TS) Tracks from 2013 to 2015 [4]. e task is closely related to the push noti cation problem that we study, and in fact the TREC Real-Time Summarization Track, which provides the context for our work, represents a merger of the TS and Microblog Tracks. However, nearly all previous evaluations, including TDT, TREC Filtering, and Temporal Summarization, merely simulated the streaming nature of the document collection, whereas in RTS the participants were required to build working systems that operated on tweets posted in real time (more details in Section 3).",1,TREC,True
27,"Our online in-situ evaluation framework builds on growing interest in so-called Living Labs [22, 24] and related Evaluation-as-aService (EaaS) [9] approaches that a empt to be er align evaluation methodologies with user task models and real-world constraints to increase the delity of research experiments. In this respect, our comparison between user-oriented and batch evaluations ties into a long history of research that examines the correlation between e ectiveness metrics from system-oriented evaluations and metrics from user-oriented evaluations [1, 3, 10, 23, 26, 29­31]. ere is, however, one important di erence: all of these cited papers, with one exception [31], focus on ad hoc retrieval, which has received much a ention over the years. Although there have been previous user studies on push noti cations from the HCI perspective (e.g., [17]), there is relatively li le empirical work on prospective information needs that we can draw from.",1,ad,True
28,"e nal thread of relevant work concerns interleaved evaluations [7, 11, 19, 20, 25], which have emerged as the preferred approach to evaluating web search engines over traditional A/B testing [12]. Our work departs from this large body of literature because these papers all focus on web search ranking, whereas we tackle the push noti cation problem: in our task, systems must take into account temporality and redundancy, both of which are less important in web search. e length of system output (i.e., volume of pushed messages) is another major di erence between",1,ad,True
29,"our task and web ranking. ese issues were explored in a recent paper by Qian et al. [18], who extended the interleaved evaluation methodology to retrospective and prospective information needs on document streams. However, their proposed approach was only validated in simulation. We take the next step by deploying an adapted version of their proposed technique in a live user study.",1,ad,True
30,3 EVALUATION METHODOLOGY,0,,False
31,"Although the push noti cation problem is applicable to document streams in general, we focus on social media posts: the public nature of Twi er makes tweets the ideal source for shared evaluations. In particular, Twi er provides a streaming API through which clients can obtain a sample (approximately 1%) of public tweets--this level of access is available to anyone who signs up for an account. In order to evaluate push noti cation systems in a realistic se ing, the TREC 2016 RTS Track de ned an o cial evaluation period during which all participants ""listened"" to the tweet sample stream to identify relevant and novel tweets with respect to users' interest pro les in a timely manner. e evaluation period began Tuesday, August 2, 2016 00:00:00 UTC and lasted until ursday, August 11, 2016 23:59:59 UTC.",1,AP,True
32,"Interest pro les, which represent users' information needs, followed the standard TREC ad hoc topic format of ""title"", ""description"", and ""narrative"". ese were made available to all participants a few weeks prior to the beginning of the evaluation period. Given the prospective nature of the pro les, it is di cult to anticipate what topics will be discussed during the evaluation period and what events will be ""interesting"". Instead, the organizers adopted the strategy of ""overgenerate and cull"": in total, 203 interest pro les were provided to the participants, more than there were resources available for assessment, with the anticipation of le ing users decide what pro les should be assessed (more details below).",1,TREC,True

35,"e overall evaluation framework is shown in Figure 1. Before the evaluation period, participants ""registered"" their systems with the evaluation broker to request unique tokens (via a REST API), which are used in subsequent requests to associate submi ed tweets with speci c systems.1 During the evaluation period, whenever a system identi ed a relevant tweet with respect to an interest pro le, the system submi ed the tweet id to the evaluation broker (also via a REST API), which recorded the submission time. Each system was allowed to push at most ten tweets per interest pro le per day; this limit represents an a empt to model user fatigue.",1,AP,True

Either way, the tweet is added to a queue in a custom app on the user's mobile device, which she can access at any time to examine the queue of accumulated tweets. For each tweet, the user can make one of three judgments with respect to the associated interest pro le: relevant, if the tweet contains relevant and novel information; redundant, if the tweet contains relevant information, but is substantively similar to another tweet that the user had already seen; not relevant, if the tweet does not contain relevant information. As the user provides judgments, results are relayed back to the evaluation broker and recorded. Users have the option of logging out of the app, at which point they will cease to receive noti cations completely (until they log back in).",1,ad,True
50,"Our setup has two distinct characteristics: First, judgments happen online as systems generate output, as opposed to traditional batch post-hoc evaluation methodologies, which consider the documents some time (typically, weeks) a er they have been generated by the systems. Note that although the push noti cations are delivered in real-time, it is not necessarily the case that judgments are provided in real time since users can ignore the noti cations and come back to them later. Second, our judgments are in situ, in the sense that the users are going about their daily activities (and are thus interrupted by the noti cations). is aspect of the design accurately mirrors the intended use of push noti cation systems. Furthermore, from the evaluation perspective, we believe that this setup yields more situationally-accurate assessments, particularly for rapidly developing events. With post-hoc batch evaluations, there is always a bit of disconnect as the assessor needs to ""imagine"" herself at the time the update was pushed. With our evaluation framework, we remove this disconnect.",1,ad,True
51,"Our entire evaluation was framed as a user study (with appropriate ethics review and approval).

[18], which meant that tweets were pushed to users as soon as the broker received the submi ed tweets from the systems. Although Qian et al. only discussed interleaving the output of two systems, it is straightforward to extend their strategy to multiple systems. e broker made sure that each tweet was only pushed once (per pro le), in the case where the same tweet was submi ed by multiple systems at di erent times. Although one can imagine di erent ""routing"" algorithms for pushing tweets to di erent users that have subscribed to a pro le, we implemented the simplest possible algorithm where the tweet was pushed to all users that had subscribed to the pro le. is meant that the broker might receive more than one judgment per tweet.",1,ad,True
56,3.2 Online Metrics,0,,False
57,"e output of our online in-situ evaluation is a sequence of judgments, which need further aggregation before we can use the results to compare the e ectiveness of di erent systems. Note that this aggregation is more complicated than a similar process in interleaved evaluations for web search because systems can vary widely in tweet volume (i.e., how many tweets they push). In standard interleaving techniques for evaluating web search, both variant algorithms being tested contribute to the nal ranking for all queries-- thus, it usually su ces to count the number (or fraction) of clicks to determine the winner (e.g., [7, 24]). However, in our case, there isn't a query that lends itself to a natural paired comparison. Some systems are quite pro igate in dispatching noti cations, while other systems are very quiet.",0,,False
58,"Another implication of our interleaved evaluation setup is that a user will encounter tweets from di erent systems, which makes the proper interpretation of ""redundant"" judgments more complex. A tweet might only be redundant because the same information was contained in a tweet pushed earlier by another system (and thus not the ""fault"" of the particular system that pushed the tweet). In other words, the interleaving itself was directly responsible for introducing the redundancy. is observation was made by Qian et al. [18], who proposed a heuristic for more accurate credit assignment when interleaving two systems. However, we decided to adopt a much simpler approach (explained below), which is justi ed by our experimental results (more details later).",1,ad,True

Online precision computes the fraction of relevant user judgments, but does not factor in the volume of tweets that a system pushes. Online utility implies a particular precision target with volume as a scaling factor, and thus serves as a convenient composite metric. To see why this is so, consider a system that achieves a precision of 0.5: se ing aside relevance grades for now, the expected utility per tweet is zero (for  ,"" 0.5) and the overall expected utility is also zero, regardless of how many tweets the system pushes. A system with lower precision has a negative expected utility per tweet, and the total expected utility is simply that value multiplied by the volume of tweets. Since the precision of most systems in the evaluation falls below 0.5, we observe a strong negative correlation between tweet volume and utility: this can be clearly seen in the middle plot in Figure 4, which shows tweet volume against online utility. Here, volume is measured as the number of tweets pushed by the system for all interest pro les that received at least one judgment.""",1,ad,True
221,"Our argument can be generalized to other ways of computing utility. Of course, one could assign di erent weights to non-relevant tweets, but for every weighting scheme, there is an implied precision at which the expected utility per tweet is zero. Only systems that have higher precision can provide positive utility; otherwise, negative utility is directly proportional to push volume. e same idea can be straightforwardly extended to relevance grades: all utility-based metrics encode (at least implicitly) a breakeven point between ""good"" results and ""bad"" results.",1,ad,True

Tweet volume here is measured as the total number of tweets pushed across the interest pro les that were evaluated by NIST assessors. Due to the much more involved batch evaluation methodology, the NIST assessors considered a smaller set of interest pro les than users in the online evaluation, and thus the plots report smaller tweet volumes.

Nevertheless, we do observe some outliers: the group of runs around 0.06 in EG-1 and around 0.2 in nCG-1 are those that push a high volume of tweets. What they lack in the overall quality of individual tweets, they make up in volume, leading to higher nCG-1 than their EG-1 scores would otherwise suggest (i.e., the points lie above the trend).",1,ad,True

However, we argue that explicit judgments are an important component of push noti cations since they, by de nition, interrupt the user. Given that the interruption has already occurred (if the user has chosen to a end to the noti cation), allowing the user an opportunity to provide feedback seems like good design. us, we argue that our evaluation setup is realistic, mirroring how a production push noti cation system might be deployed. For example, in some implementations today, noti cations already appear with a ""dismiss"" option for users to take explicit action; adding options for quality feedback would incur minimal extra cost.",1,ad,True
281,"At a high-level, our work supports three ndings: First, that online in-situ interleaved evaluations of push noti cations systems are workable in practice. It is indeed possible to recruit users and they are willing to provide su cient judgments (quite diligently, in fact) to meaningfully evaluate systems. is seems consistent with our arguments above regarding the role of explicit judgments in push noti cation systems. Second, we observe substantial correlations between online and batch evaluation metrics that share the same design (e.g., are precision-oriented or utility-based). ird, the volume of messages that a system pushes is an important aspect of system evaluation, but its role is not fully understood.",0,,False
282,"With respect to the second nding--the substantial correlation between online and batch metrics--this is by no means obvious, given the large body of literature that has shown divergences between user- and system-oriented metrics (see Section 2).

283,"· e batch evaluation considered all tweets that all systems pushed during the evaluation period. at is, all push noti cations were included in the pool and so the judgments are exhaustive from the perspective of the participants. is stands in contrast to the online judgments, which are best characterized as a small convenience sample by users (see response rates in Table 1). We have no control over when and how many judgments are provided-- and whether there are any systematic biases, for example, a user who only marks relevant tweets but ignores non-relevant tweets (i.e., a bias against explicit negative judgments).",0,,False

Accordingly, systems are penalized for retrieving multiple tweets that say that same thing. In contrast, user judgments occur tweet-by-tweet and represent a ""local"" view-- our users assess only the tweets in front of them. Furthermore, redundant judgments are made with respect only to tweets the users had previously assessed, and are subject to the e ects of imperfect memory. Another consequence of this setup is that from batch judgments we can characterize silent days (at least within the limitations of pooling), whereas with online judgments there is no way for the user to obtain this information. us, it is not possible for an online metric to reward systems for ""staying quiet"".

We might imagine the user having access to a ""volume dial"" to provide feedback: ""yes, these are all good tweets, but too many!""
