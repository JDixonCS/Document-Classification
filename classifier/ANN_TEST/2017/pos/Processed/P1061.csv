13,"Sentence ordering (SO) is a key component of verbal ability. It is also crucial for automatic text generation. While numerous researchers developed various methods to automatically evaluate the informativeness of the produced contents, the evaluation of readability is usually performed manually. In contrast to that, we present a selfsu cient metric for SO assessment based on text topic-comment structure. We show that this metric has high accuracy.",1,ad,True

19,"e text is hardly comprehensible. When we are reading the Nibelung or the ring in question, we are asking ourselves what's it all about? which Nibelung? what question? even if in the next sentence it becomes clearer. Let us now reverse the two sentences:",1,ad,True

21,"Now, it is clear that the Nibelung and the ring in question explain the opera title e Ring of the Nibelung. ese examples illustrate that appropriate SO is crucial for readability. Automatic text generation, particularly multi-document extractive summarization, systems also face SO problem [3, 4].

In order to measure the quality of SO, if a gold standard is available, then correlation between the ground truth SO and the system order (e.g. Kendall or Spearman rank correlation coe cients) can be used [19]. e requirement of a gold standard containing the correct SO limits the usage of such methods. Indeed, gold standard is o en not available or not obvious to build manually. In contrast, in this paper we propose a self-su cient metric for text coherence assessment that does not require additional data. We evaluate the quality of the metric using the framework proposed in [12]. To evaluate the text coherence, we use a linguistic approach based on the topic-comment structure of the text and inter-sentence similarity.",1,ad,True

27,"but connects the sentence to the context. us, the topic and the comment are opposed in terms of the given/new information. e contraposition of the given/new information is called information structure or topic-comment structure. Going back to Example 1.1, the Nibelung and the ring in question from the rst sentence are expected to be already known by the reader, i.e. they represent topics. However, only the next sentence provides the necessary information. In contrast, in Example 1.2 the rst mention of the ring and the Nibelung was given at the end of the rst sentence ( e Ring of the Nibelung) and then is detailed in the second sentence. In the rst sentence, Wagner's opera title Der Ring des Nibelungen incarnates the topic and is most literally rendered in English as e Ring of the Nibelung corresponds to the comment. In the second sentence, e Nibelung and the ring in question refers to topic, while the comment parts are presented by is the dwarf Alberich and is the one he fashions from the Rhine Gold.",1,ad,True
28,"Although, in literature topic-comment structure has been exploited for document re-ranking [13], classi cation [5], and text summarization [11], to our knowledge, it has never been applied for SO. e contribution of this paper is a completely automatic approach for SO evaluation based on topic-comment structure of a text that requires only shallow parsing and has linear complexity. Our metric considers the pairwise term similarities of the topics and the comments of the adjacent sentences in a text since word repetition is one of the formal signs of text coherence [1].",1,ad,True

33,"Current methods to evaluate readability are based on the familiarity of terms and syntax complexity [8]. Word complexity may be estimated by humans [7, 14, 29] or according to its length [30]. Researches also propose to use language models [8, 27]. Usually assessors assign a score to the readability of a text in some range [1]. Syntactical errors, unresolved anaphora, redundant information and coherence in uence readability and therefore the score may depend on the number of these mistakes [26]. BLEU and edit distance may be applied for relevance judgment as well as for readability evaluation. ese metrics are semi-automatic because they require a gold standard. Another set of methods is based on syntax analysis which may be combined with statistics (e.g. sentence length, depth of a parse tree, omission of personal verbs, rate of prepositional phrases, noun and verb groups) [6, 25, 32, 33], but they remain suitable only for the readability evaluation of a particular sentence and, therefore, cannot be used for assessing extracts. Lapata applies the greedy algorithm maximizing the total probability on a text corpus as well as using a speci c ordering to verb tenses [18]. Louis and Nenkova use a hidden Markov model in which the coherence between adjacent sentences is viewed as transition rules between di erent topics [23]. Barzilay and Lapata introduce an entity grid model where sentences are mapped into discourse entities with their grammatical roles [2]. Entity features are used to compute the probability of transitions between adjacent sentences. en machine learning classi ers are applied. Elsner and Charniak add co-reference features [10]. Lin et al. ameliorate the model by discourse relations [21]. e entity grid model and its extensions require syntactical parsing. e disadvantages of these models are data sparsity, domain dependence and computational complexity.",1,ad,True
34,"e closest work to ours is [12] that proposes an automatic approach for SO assessment where the similarity between adjacent sentences is used as a measure of text coherence. However, it assigns equal scores to initial and inverse SO due to the symmetric similarity measure. In contrast, our topic-comment based method assigns higher score to the text in Example 1.2 than 1.1.",1,ad,True
35,3 TOPIC-COMMENT STRUCTURE FOR SO,0,,False
36,"Although it is not the core element of our method, in order to be er understand the topic-comment structure of texts of di erent genres, we manually examined 10 documents randomly chosen from three datasets (30 texts in total): (1) Wikipedia; (2) TREC Robust1; (3) TREC WT10G (for collection details see Section 4). We looked at topic-topic (TT), comment-topic (CT), topic-comment (TC) and comment-comment (CC) inter-sentence relations in the texts, i.e. how frequently a topic (or a comment) of a clause became a topic (or a comment) in posterior clauses. We found that for all collections, the most frequent relation is TT, then follows CT. TT+CT compose more than 65% of the relationships that we found, whatever the collection is; it is more than 80% for Wikipedia. CC is more rare and TC is the most uncommon relation, especially in Wikipedia.",1,Wiki,True
37,"is preliminary analysis convinced us that using the topiccomment structure could be useful to evaluate readability and that weighting these relations could be a good cue. However, for a scalable method the text structure has to be extracted or annotated",1,ad,True

Several parsers have been developed to extract text structure such as HILDA [17] that implements topic changes or SPADE [28] which extracts rhetorical relations and has been used in [22] for example to re-rank documents. ese parsers are based on deep analysis of linguistic features and are hardly usable when large volumes of texts are involved. Moreover, they view the topiccomment relation as a remark on the statement while we consider a topic as the phrase that the rest of the clause is understood to be about as in [13].",0,,False
40,"e information structure is opposed to formal structure of a clause with grammatical elements as constituents. In contrast to a grammatical subject that is a merely grammatical category, a topic refers to the information or pragmatic structure of a clause and how it is related to other clauses. However, in a simple English clause, a topic usually coincides with a subject. One of the exceptions are expletives (e.g. it is raining) that have only a comment part [15]. Since the unmarked word order in English is Subject - Verb - Object (SVO), we can assume that a topic is usually placed before a verb. As in [13], we also assume that if a subordinate clause provides details on an object, it is rather related to a comment part. us, in our method we split a sentence into two parts by a personal verb (not in nitive nor participle) where the rst part is considered to be a topic while the rest is viewed as a comment. As opposed to other methods from the literature, this method requires only part-of-speech tagging and its computational complexity is linear over the number of words as well as the number of sentences in a text.",0,,False
41,"e key idea of our method is that in a coherent text there are relations between topic (or comment) parts of the adjacent sentences and these relations are manifested by word repetition. We represent topic and comment parts of a sentence by bag-ofwords. In order to capture the topic-comment relation, we calculate the similarity between them. We propose to use term and noun based similarities.
