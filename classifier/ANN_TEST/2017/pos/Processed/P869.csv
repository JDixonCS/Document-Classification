6,"We address the problem of query performance prediction (QPP) using reference lists. To date, no previous QPP method has been fully successful in generating and utilizing several pseudo-e ective and pseudo-ine ective reference lists. In this work, we try to ll the gaps. We rst propose a novel unsupervised approach for generating and selecting both types of reference lists using query perturbation and statistical inference. We then propose an enhanced QPP approach that utilizes both types of selected reference lists.",1,ad,True
7,1 BACKGROUND,0,,False
8,"We address the problem of query performance prediction (QPP) using reference lists. We focus on post-retrieval QPP [2]. Given a query, a corpus and a retrieval method that evaluates the query, a post-retrieval QPP method predicts the e ectiveness of the query's retrieved result list [2].",1,ad,True
9,"While existing post-retrieval QPP methods may seem di erent at rst glance, as Kurland et al. [4] have pointed out, many of them are actually built on the same grounds. Common to such methods is the usage of a single list that acts as a pseudo-e ective (PE for short) or pseudo-ine ective (PIE for short) reference list (RL for short) for predicting the performance of a given target list [4]. Example methods that utilize a single PE-RL are the ery Feedback [12] (QF) and the Utility Estimation Framework [7] (UEF) methods. Example methods that utilize a single PIE-RL are the Weighted Information Gain [12] (WIG) and the Normalized ery Commitment [9] (NQC) methods. Given a target list for prediction and a RL, the former's performance is typically predicted according to the similarity between the two lists [4].",1,WIG,True
10,"Few previous works have further tried to utilize several RLs for QPP [4, 5, 7, 8, 11]. Yet, these works have either manually selected1 RLs [4, 7] or generated RLs with no type distinction (i.e., PE or PIE) [8, 11]. In addition, works that did consider the RL types have either used only PE-RLs [5, 7] or linearly combined two RLs, one of each type [4]. Lately, Shtok et al.

336,"most cases); with an average of +10.2 ± 2% and +11.2 ± 3% improvement over WIG and NQC, respectively. Next, comparing RLS side-by-side with the other alternatives, we further observe that, RLS in all cases but one, provides be er prediction quality (again, signi cantly in most cases); with an average improvement of +5.2±1.6% and +3±1.4% over the best alternative, when WIG and NQC are used as the underlying base method, respectively.",1,WIG,True
337,"We next make the observation that, while RLS provided a consistent improvement over WIG and NQC, when the later were used as the underlying base methods, the other alternatives do not share the same behavior. Closer examination of the results of these alternatives across the corpora shades some light. Focusing on the UEF method, we can observe that, only in 7 out of the 10 cases it managed to improve the base method. is may be a ributed to the RL R (D) utilized by UEF for prediction, where for some corpora such RLs may not comply with UEF's PE-RL assumption (e.g., due to possible query-dri [6]). Hence, measuring the similarity with such RLs actually result in performance degradation. is argument is further supported by examining the performance of the RefList method (an extension of UEF [5]), where in only 4 out of the 10 cases it managed to improve over the base method. Such additional performance degradation may be a ributed to the fact that, RefList aggregates over several RLs with no distinction of their type, and, therefore, it may accumulate even more error.",1,WIG,True
338,"Closer examination of the two alternative methods that do distinguish between both types of RLs, PE-PIE and LogLoss, further reveals an interesting trend. First, we observe that, PE-PIE in 9 out of 10 cases has resulted in much worse performance than that of the base method used to obtain the two (PE and PIE) RLs. erefore, it seems that, a simple linear interpolation of a PE-RL with a PIE-RL as proposed by the PE-PIE method, where the dissimilarity from the PIE-RL is calculated by substraction, does not actually work well. Similar to the UEF vs. RefList case, a further comparison of the PE-PIE with LogLoss supports this argument. e summation over several PIE-RLs using a similar (log) substraction approach only results in further performance degradation due to more accumulated error. It is worth noting again that, both PE-PIE and LogLoss methods were never evaluated with automatically selected RLs. To remind, in [4], the PE-PIE method was tested with a manual selection of the PE-RL and the PIE-RL; whereas, the LogLoss method was not fully validated [8].",1,ad,True
339,"To conclude, among the various alternatives we have examined, none has exhibited a robust performance prediction similar to that",0,,False
340,"of the RLS approach. We believe that, our results shade new light on the problem of QPP using RLs and the challenges that the designers of such methods may face.",1,ad,True
