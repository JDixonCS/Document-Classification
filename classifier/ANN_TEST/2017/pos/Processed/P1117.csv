13,We adopt the generalized Pareto distribution for the informationbased model and show that the parameters can be estimated based on the mean excess function. The proposed information retrieval model corresponds to the extension of the divergence from independence and is designed to be data-driven. The proposed model is then applied to the specific object search called the instance search and the effectiveness is experimentally confirmed.,1,ad,True

18,1 INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
19,"Effective information retrieval (IR) models have been actively studied roughly since 1960s in the IR community. BM25, language model-based IR (LM) and divergence from randomness (DFR) are state-of-the-art. The axiomatic approach is also proposed [1]. Recently, information-based model (I model) [2] and percentilebased model (P model) [3] are proposed. These models are simple compared to the DFR, since only one distribution is necessary (two distributions are required for the DFR). The problem then becomes the adequate setting of the distribution. There are interesting relations such that adopting the log-logistic distribution (LLD) for I model and P model yields LM with JelinekMercer smoothing and sub-linear normalized term frequency (NTF) term in the BM25 model, respectively [4][3]. Although these facts somehow support the effectiveness of I model and P model, the essential problem is whether the data to be searched follow the",1,LM,True
20,"LLD or not. Setting the suitable distribution to the objective data is important for the successful retrieval. Recently, the distribution is estimated using the extreme value statistics (EVS) [5]. The distribution that the maximum NTF follows according to the EVS is adopted in the P model. To my knowledge, it is the first successful application of the EVS to the IR model. In this paper, we propose the distribution estimation for the I model according to the EVS and this is the main contribution. We also show that the proposed model corresponds to the extension of the divergence from independence (DFI) [6] which is a parameter-free IR model. Since the parameters of the proposed model are estimated according to the data, the retrieval accuracy is expected to be improved. We demonstrate it for the specific object search called the instance search [7] using image-query video retrieval dataset. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We describe the proposed model and explain the relation to the DFI model in Section 2. We also clarify the difference from the method in [5]. Section 3 shows the experimental justification using the instance search dataset and the detailed discussion is provided. Finally, Section 4 concludes this paper.",1,ad,True

140,"proposed model is based on the GPD assumption, there is a possibility that the EVS basic assumption somehow holds for the NTF. Roughly speaking, when the NTF follows a heavy-tailed distribution, such a proposition is true. When large often occurs in a video, the NTF is expected to follow a heavy-tailed distribution. Considering a video which is the time series of frame images, similar or even same key-points often repeatedly occur in the video, which contributes to large . Such key-points are described as ""bursty"" in the image/video retrieval community and it is known that the adequate treatment is essential for the successful retrieval. Therefore, for the video retrieval task such as the instance search, the NTF can be expected to follow a heavy-tailed distribution. The larger supports the GPD assumption for the TED further and we expect that this tendency is shown in Table 1. The results in Table 1 also indicate that the TED with large are sufficient for the successful video retrieval and that taking the whole data into account results in the deteriorated search accuracy. This is also the main finding of this paper. It is interesting to see whether this proposition also holds for the document retrieval task.
