7,"So ware toolkits play an essential role in information retrieval research. Most open-source toolkits developed by academics are designed to facilitate the evaluation of retrieval models over standard test collections. E orts are generally directed toward be er ranking and less a ention is usually given to scalability and other operational considerations. On the other hand, Lucene has become the de facto platform in industry for building search applications (outside a small number of companies that deploy custom infrastructure). Compared to academic IR toolkits, Lucene can handle heterogeneous web collections at scale, but lacks systematic support for evaluation over standard test collections. is paper introduces Anserini, a new information retrieval toolkit that aims to provide the best of both worlds, to be er align information retrieval practice and research. Anserini provides wrappers and extensions on top of core Lucene libraries that allow researchers to use more intuitive APIs to accomplish common research tasks. Our initial e orts have focused on three functionalities: scalable, multi-threaded inverted indexing to handle modern web-scale collections, streamlined IR evaluation for ad hoc retrieval on standard test collections, and an extensible architecture for multi-stage ranking. Anserini ships with support for many TREC test collections, providing a convenient way to replicate competitive baselines right out of the box. Experiments verify that our system is both e cient and e ective, providing a solid foundation to support future research.",1,ad,True

9,"Information retrieval researchers have a long history of developing, sharing, and using so ware toolkits to support their work. Over the past several decades, various IR toolkits have been built to aid in the development of new retrieval models, to test hypotheses about information seeking, and to validate new evaluation methodologies. As the eld moves forward, IR toolkits are expected to keep up with emerging requirements such as the ability to handle large web collections and new data formats. e growing complexity of modern so ware ecosystems and the resource constraints most academic research groups operate under make maintaining opensource toolkits a constant struggle.",1,ad,True

13,"Most IR toolkits developed by academics, such as Indri,1 Galago,2 and Terrier3 were primarily designed to facilitate evaluation over standard test collections from evaluation forums such as TREC, CLEF, NTCIR, etc. In many cases, scalability took a back seat to e orts around improving retrieval models, and thus these systems o en struggle to scale to modern web collection. As an example, the ClueWeb12 collection4 contains 733 million web pages, totaling 5.54 TB compressed (or 27.3 TB uncompressed). e standard practice for working with this collection, as exempli ed by the infrastructure built for the TREC 2014 Session Track [4], is to separately index partitions of the collection and then build a distributed broker architecture that integrates results from each partition. In general, working with web-scale collections using existing academic IR toolkits is time- and resource-intensive, even for basic tasks.",1,ad,True
14,"With the exception of a small number of companies (e.g., commercial web search engines), the open-source Lucene system5 and its derivatives such as Solr and Elasticsearch (for convenience, we simply refer to as ""Lucene"" collectively in this paper) have become the de facto platform for deploying search applications in industry. Examples include LinkedIn, Twi er, Bloomberg, as well as a number of online retailers and many large companies in the nancial services space. Despite its undeniable operational success, a large user base, and a vibrant community of contributors, Lucene is not well suited to information retrieval research. For many reasons, including poor documentation of system internals and a number of unintuitive abstractions, Lucene is not as widely used for research as academic toolkits such as Indri or Terrier.",1,ad,True
15,"In this paper, we describe our e orts in developing a new opensource information retrieval toolkit called Anserini that builds on Lucene.6 We aim to bridge the gap described above that separates information retrieval research from the practice of building real-world search applications.

20,"We experimentally evaluate the e ciency and e ectiveness of Anserini on a number of standard test collections. In terms of indexing performance, it is able to handle the largest research web collection available today with ease on a single modern server. We observe be er indexing performance compared to Indri, a popular choice among researchers today. In terms of retrieval, we also nd that Anserini is not only faster than Indri, but returns rankings that are comparable in quality. In other words, Anserini is faster and just as good. We present the case that Anserini should be adopted as the toolkit of choice for information retrieval researchers.",1,ad,True
21,2 ANSERINI OVERVIEW,0,,False
22,2.1 Motivation,0,,False
23,"Despite its popularity in industry and broad adoption for operational search deployments, Lucene remains under-utilized in information retrieval research. We begin with some high-level discussions of why we believe this might be so to motivate our e orts in building Anserini.",1,ad,True
24,"From the very beginning, Lucene was wri en for ""real world"" search applications, not with researchers in mind. For the most part, its developers targeted an audience that mostly used search engines as black boxes, as opposed to researchers that required access to ranking internals such as scoring models, mechanisms for postings traversal, etc. Because of the target user population, documentation for Lucene internals has always been quite poor, especially in keeping up with the relatively rapid pace at which the developer community has been releasing improved versions of the so ware. Access to these internals is exactly what information retrieval researchers need for their studies, and therefore poor documentation has been a barrier to entry.",0,,False
25,"To further compound this issue, the internal APIs in Lucene are not organized in a way that would be intuitive to most IR researchers, with class names that are not indicative of functionality and many levels of indirection. is is not an issue for ""black box"" users of Lucene, but presents a hurdle for information retrieval researchers who desire access to system internals. As an example, the code to open up a Lucene index and to traverse postings programmatically (without invoking the scoring function) is unnecessarily complex and involves dispatching to several intermediate classes along the way. Some researchers have the impression that Lucene is di cult to use, and indeed there is some truth to this, especially with respect to low-level abstractions.",1,AP,True
26,"Another side e ect of Lucene's focus on ""black box"" search is that it has severely lagged behind in the implementation of modern ranking functions. For the longest time, the default scoring model was an ad hoc variant of tf-idf. Okapi BM25 was not added to Lucene until 2011,7 more than a decade a er it gained widespread adoption in the research community as being more e ective than tf-idf variants. is lag in adopting ""research best practices"" has contributed to the perception that Lucene is not e ective and illsuited for information retrieval research. However, this perception is no longer accurate today. Lucene comes with implementations of modern baseline retrieval models, and we show that the e ectiveness of Lucene's implementations is at least as good as those o ered by academic IR toolkits (see Section 3).",1,ad,True
27,7h ps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2959,0,,False
28,"Finally, because Lucene is wri en in Java, there is sometimes the perception that it is slow and ine cient, particularly when scaling up to modern web collections. Developers o en point to the managed memory environment of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as not being conducive to e cient low-level implementations of search engine internals. We experimentally show that this is de nitely not true (see Section 3). e open-source community has devoted substantial e ort to optimizing the performance of Lucene and taking advantage of today's multi-core processors. It is capable of handling large web collections on a single server with ease.",1,ad,True
29,"e goal of Anserini is to align the practice of building search applications with research in information retrieval. Colloquially speaking, our toolkit aims to smooth the ""rough edges"" around Lucene for the purposes of information retrieval research. It is not our goal to replace or to reimplement Lucene, but rather to facilitate its use for research by presenting as gentle a learning curve as possible to newcomers.",0,,False
30,2.2 Main Components,0,,False
31,"Anserini components fall into two categories: wrappers and extensions. Wrappers provide APIs that leverage core Lucene library components to accomplish speci c tasks. ey are tightly integrated with ""core"" Lucene and in some cases, represent custom implementations of existing Lucene APIs. Extensions, on the other hand, are components that are distinct from Lucene and more loosely coupled: these may represent our own implementations or connectors to third-party libraries.",1,AP,True
32,"Multi-threaded indexing (wrapper). Inverted indexing is one of the most fundamental tasks in information retrieval and the starting point of many research studies. In working with large web collections, it is imperative that indexing operations are e cient and scalable. While academic researchers have a empted to address this issue via MapReduce and related frameworks [5, 11], these solutions impose the burden of requiring clusters and additional so ware infrastructure.",1,ad,True
33,"Lucene supports multi-threaded indexing, and as we experimentally show (Section 3), it is able to scale up to large web collections on a single commodity server. e biggest issue, however, is that Lucene itself only provides access to a collection of indexing components that researchers need to assemble together to build an end-to-end indexer. For example, the developer would need to write from scratch custom document processing pipelines, code for managing individual indexing threads, and implementations of load balancing and synchronization procedures.",1,ad,True
34,"We address these issues in Anserini by providing abstractions for document collections that an IR researcher would be comfortable with, as well as the implementation of an e cient, high-throughput, multi-threaded indexer that takes advantage of these abstractions. Anserini models collections as comprised of individual segments (for example, the ClueWeb12 collection is comprised of a number of compressed WARC les) and provides implementations for common document formats--for parsing TREC-style XML documents, web pages stored in WARCs, tweets in JSON format, etc. In fact, Anserini ships with the ability to index many TREC collections ""right out of the box"". is greatly reduces the learning curve for researchers to get started with Lucene.",1,ad,True

61,"Streamlined IR evaluation (extension). Test collections play an important role in information retrieval research, and a substantial amount of research activity in improving ranking models is focused around ad hoc retrieval runs. A research toolkit should make this ""inner loop"" of IR research as easy as possible. Since Lucene was not originally designed for researchers, support for running experiments on standard test collections is largely missing. Anserini lls this gap by implementing missing features: parsers for di erent query formats, a uni ed driver program for ad hoc experiments that outputs standard trec eval format, etc. For convenience, existing TREC topics and qrels are included directly in our code repository--once again, reducing the learning curve for researchers to get started with Lucene.",1,ad,True
62,"ere are two main uses for this feature in Anserini: First, our toolkit provides an easy way for researchers to replicate baselines of standard retrieval models such as BM25 and query likelihood. Armstrong et al. [2] previously identi ed the prevalent problem of weak baselines in experimental IR papers. Lin et al. [10] further observed that authors are o en vague about the baseline parameter se ings and the implementations they use. For example, Mu¨hleisen et al. [13] reported large di erences in e ectiveness across four systems that all purport to implement BM25. Trotman et al. [15] pointed out that BM25 and query likelihood with Dirichlet priors can actually refer to at least half a dozen variants, and in some cases, di erences in e ectiveness are statistically signi cant. ere is substantial community interest in engaging with reproducibilityrelated issues [1, 8], and Anserini contributes to this discussion. Our proposed solution is to have widely-available baselines that are both competitive in e ectiveness and easy to replicate. It is our hope that Anserini can ll this role.",0,,False
63,"Second, an easy-to-use baseline retrieval component in Anserini provides the starting point for additional ranking extensions.
