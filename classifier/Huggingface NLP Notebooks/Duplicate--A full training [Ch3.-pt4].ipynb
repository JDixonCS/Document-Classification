It also produced aerosols at least 4 orders of magnitude less than nebulisation therapy. This suggests that nitrous oxide sedation delivered by continuous flow with a close-fitting cushion facemask and gas-scavenging has a low risk of aerosol viral transmission to health-care workers in the event that the child has a subclinical viral infection. Similar techniques could be employed in future to determine the aerosol-generating potential of other clinical procedures.', 5897: 'Acknowledgement', 5898: 'References', 5899: 'R Millar and A Moorhouse', 5900: '4 NSW Health.

Samples obtained from the jejunum display mild villous shortening with striking crypt hyperplasia and regenerative epithelial changes unaccompanied by substantially increased inflammation (E).

C Platelet-rich thrombi (asterisk) are present in vessels (D). A third patient with COVID-19 developed severe diarrheal symptoms presumably due to the pro-inflammatory state promoted by the virus. Samples obtained from the jejunum display mild villous shortening with striking crypt hyperplasia and regenerative epithelial changes unaccompanied by substantially increased inflammation (E). Colonic samples from the same patient show a similar degree of epithelial cell injury without increased inflammation.
