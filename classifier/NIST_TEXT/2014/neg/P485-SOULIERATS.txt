ABSTRACT
Most of the previous approaches surrounding collaborative information retrieval (CIR) provide either a user-based mediation, in which the system only supports users' collaborative activities, or a system-based mediation, in which the system plays an active part in balancing user roles, reranking results, and distributing them to optimize overall retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose to combine both of these approaches by a role mining methodology that learns from users' actions about the retrieval strategy they adapt. This hybrid method aims at showing how users are dierent and how to use these dierences for suggesting roles. The core of the method is expressed as an algorithm that (1) monitors users' actions in a CIR setting; (2) discovers dierences among the collaborators along certain dimensions; and (3) suggests appropriate roles to make the most out of individual skills and optimize IR performance. Our approach is empirically evaluated and relies on two dierent laboratory studies involving 70 pairs of users. Our experiments show promising results that highlight how role mining could optimize the collaboration within a search session. The contributions of this work include a new algorithm for mining user roles in collaborative IR, an evaluation methodology, and a new approach to improve IR performance with the operationalization of user-driven system-mediated collaboration.

1. INTRODUCTION
In an information retrieval (IR) process, there are several ways to improve retrieval performance or eectiveness. Some approaches, such as pseudo-relevance feedback [13] and query expansion [30] focus on improving IR systems and algorithms. Others try to improve users' experience by oering related queries [2] or making personalized recommendations [29]. In the end, the eectiveness of an IR setting has to do with user's preferences and/or skills just as much as it has with system performance. One way that eectiveness could be improved that is often overlooked is through collaboration. The approaches described above are based on an individual searching, retrieving, and evaluating information. But what if multiple people get involved in these processes? Beyond simply dividing up the work, there could be other potential benefits of multiple people working together on a search-focused project. Specifically, if these people bring in a variety of skills, then we have an opportunity to achieve synergic eects [22]. The question is how do we know who has which skills and how do we leverage them. We could let the users decide it and let the system be simply a supporting structure. This is often referred to as user-mediated collaborative information retrieval (CIR) [15, 23]. The other option is to have the system explicitly assign prior roles and optimizing retrieval-related processes accordingly. This is often referred to as a system or an algorithmically-mediated CIR [20, 24].
Both of these lines of work have their merits and limitations. In this paper, we propose an approach that attempts to combine the best of both of these techniques. Specifically, instead of imposing the roles onto the users (systemmediated) or having the users explicitly come up with their roles (user-mediated), we propose to mine roles of collaborators implied within a collaborative search session. We refer to this as user-driven system-mediated CIR. More particularly, the contributions of this paper are twofold:

· A role mining methodology, which learns how the participants in a collaboration are dierent and uses that to suggest roles.

· An

based on two user stud-

experimental evaluation

ies involving a total number of 70 collaborative search

sessions, which shows that role mining optimizes the

collaboration within the search process.

In what follows, we introduce, in Section 2, related work surrounding the CIR domain, and more particularly, the

485

consideration of user roles within this context. Section 3 focuses on the research questions and our role mining methodology. Section 4 details our experimental setup based on two interactive IR studies and Section 5 presents and discusses the obtained results. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and presents future work.

2. RELATED WORK

2.1 User-based Mediation and System-based Mediation for CIR

A collaborative search setting involves multiple users aim-

ing at collaboratively solving a shared information need [4,

6, 25]. In [25] authors showed how collaborative search could

act as a front-end for existing search engines and re-rank re-

sults based on the learned preferences of a community of

users. They attempted to demonstrate this concept by im-

plementing the I-Spy system [4]. However, this is often in-

eective or non-trivial. For instance, Hyldegard [8], with

her studies of information seeking and retrieval in a group-

based education setting, found that even though people in

a collaborative group to some extent demonstrated similar

cognitive experiences as the individuals in Kuhlthau's Infor-

mation Search Process (ISP) model [11], these experiences

did not only result from information seeking activities, but

also from work-task activities and intra-group interactions.

Her further work also indicated [9] that group based prob-

lem solving is a dynamic process that shifts between a group

perspective and an individual perspective.

Complexity in CIR appears mainly from the fact that

collaboration is characterized by four main dimensions [6]:

(1) the

, depending on if collaboration is implicit or

intent

explicit, (2) the level of mediation, relying on how much

the system is active, (3) the

, analyzing if the

concurrency

search session is synchronous or not, (4) the

, de-

location

scribing a session involving remote or co-located users. Ris-

ing challenges in CIR [10] underline the practical necessity

of building interfaces adapted to collaboration and from an

IR perspective, leveraging IR techniques and models for supporting collaboration. To tackle these challenges, two main

lines of work can be distinguished: user-based mediation and

system-based mediation. Previous user-based mediation work have proposed collab-

orative interfaces [16, 23] supporting collaboration within a

search process by using devices, such as interactive tables

[16], or tools, such as shared workspaces [23]. The second

category of work, referred to a system-oriented mediation,

relies on the incorporation of symmetric user's roles [3, 17]

or asymmetric ones within the IR process [20, 24, 26] with

the aim of enhancing the collaboration and by the way, the

overall IR performance.

In [6], authors proposed a role taxonomy where several

sets of roles have been introduced: (1) symmetric (peers)

[6] in which users are considered as having symmetric roles;

(2) domain A expert and domain B expert [6, 26] in which

users are characterized as experts of dierent domains; (3)

search expert and search novice, respectively domain ex-

pert and domain novice [6, 27] in which users have dierent

familiarity levels towards a domain, or search tools; search

expert and domain expert [6] in which one user has access to

more functions and features with search tools, whereas the

other one is more familiar with the domain knowledge; (4)

Prospector and Miner [6, 20] in which Prospector's task is

devoted to formulating search requests, whereas the Miner's one consists of selecting relevant documents; Gatherer and Surveyor [24], in which the Gatherer aims at quickly scanning documents for identifying relevant ones whereas the Surveyor's task is devoted to favoring diversity.
2.2 Role Mining
Several research studies [21, 1, 5, 28] highlighted the value of roles as means of control in collaborative applications. Role is viewed as a tool for better understanding users' actions and interactions by putting them in context. For instance, Rodden [21] identified the value of control in computer-supported cooperative work systems and listed a number of underlying projects with their corresponding schemes for implementing control. Golder and Donath [5] considered Usenet environment for analyzing newsgroup communities. They proposed a role taxonomy involving two roles which they posit, namely "Celebrities" and "Ranters", and three well-know roles, namely "Lurkers", "Trolls" and "Newbies". They also highlighted the underlying strategies of each role and relationships between roles. Role-based control gives rise to a challenging research question: how can we mine dynamically latent roles from user-group actions and interactions in a collaborative setting?
Two main approaches for role mining are proposed in the literature. The first one, rising from the social network perspective, relies on the analysis of the topology properties of users' network through information interaction [18, 12, 19, 7]. Nowicki and Snijders [18] presented a blockstructure mining method based on pair-wise graph relations using Gibbs sampling. In [12], authors identified microblog networks leaders by applying PageRank algorithm on the followers network while Pal et al. [19] proposed to apply a probabilistic clustering method that uses a set of features from microblogging practices. Henderson et al. [7] provided an unsupervised learning approach for role mining relying on the transformation of feature-based multi-dimensional matrix where nodes represent users and edges represent information stream. The underlying objective is to select the better compression model that summarizes the users' behavior leading to roles. Dierent from the first approach, the second one discovers user's roles by looking at the similarities vs. dissimilarities between interaction data distributions among users [14]. Authors proposed, first, the LDA-based Author-Recipient-Topic (ART) model which is a global role mining approach applied in a communication social network for highlighting emerging roles through users' behavior similarities. Second, they proposed a pair-wise focused version of the ART by introducing the Role-Author-Recipient-Topic (RART) model which emphasizes roles of the author and the recipient according to the message-contents, assuming that these roles could be fixed or could evolve throughout the message writing process.
Based on relevant literature, we can see that dierent forms of roles have been introduced within a collaborative context, leveraging users' skills and experiences in order to enhance the collaboration. However, while some research studies focused on mining latent roles from users' interactions, previously proposed system-mediated collaborative ranking models assign explicitly predefined roles to users regardless of the skills in which they are the most eective. In the work reported here, we attempt to combine insights from the above works to bridge between system-mediated

486

and user-mediated collaboration and show how to leverage specific latent roles of collaborators from users' actions while relaxing the assumption behind pre-assigned roles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt for mining users' roles within a collaborative search, which enables implicitly and dynamically assigning roles to users in which they can be most eective at the current search stage.
3. RESEARCH DESIGN
3.1 Research Questions
In this work presented here, we do not assign any roles to users in the beginning of the session. Users' roles are emphasized by users' actions and are mined throughout the synchronous collaborative search session. Keeping this in mind, we address in this work the following research questions: RQ1. If the searchers working in collaboration are dierent in some aspects, how are they dierent? RQ2. How do we infer users' roles by taking into account their actions within a collaborative search session? RQ3. How can we use role information to improve CIR and IR processes in general?
3.2 Mining Users' Roles
We initially consider a user-driven search setting in which a set of users are working to meet a shared information need by identifying relevant documents.
The goal of our approach is to analyze how users are different, and, accordingly suggest roles given their dierences in order to optimize their collaborative outcome. In this way, the search session can be viewed as a sequence of two steps: (1) a user-driven level in which we assume that people start out with the same roles and responsibilities, but then over time, they may exhibit dierences and a ne their search behavior; and (2) a system-mediated level in which predefined roles have been identified, and the system optimizes the collaborative search process. In what follows, we first define preliminary notions, and, then describe our role mining methodology. Note that in order to simplify our explanation and economize our experiments, we will consider only two participants in a collaborative search process.
3.2.1 Preliminaries
Let us consider a typical scenario of collaborative IR where a pair of users (u1, u2) collaborate during a time interval T in order to answer a shared information need . Each user
I acts separately through the synchronous collaborative search session S by formulating his own queries belonging to the shared information need . For clarity, we introduce the
I following notions and notations:

User's search session.

fecting the role mining task is naturally how much the users

are dierent while searching for information during the CIR

process, we favor a feature-based representation of the user's

search session. Our goal is to characterize the user through

his past implicit actions' features F = {f1, . . . , fk, . . . , fn}

(e.g., number of visited pages, dwell time, number of formu-

lated queries etc.) captured during his/her search process.

To achieve this, t is represented as a matrix (t) 2 Rtn

where each element (t)( ) represents the cumulative

value of feature for user aggregated across the search

session during the time interval [t0 . . . tl]. This aggregation

highlights the overall behavior of the user at timestamp

tl

since looking at feature values at a particular timestamp may

not be enough considering that individual behaviors are con-

stantly changing. Moreover, it avoids the bias induced by

noisy search actions.

Roles.

A pair R1,2 of roles (r1, r2) involves a couple of users

(u1, u2) assumed to have dierent specific search features.

We introduce a role pattern 2 R1,2 , where is the

which rep-

resents the underlined behaviors of users of the col-

laborative group if they are performing these roles.

Each element ( R1,2 ) highlights the expected reF fj , fk
lation such as positive correlation (+1), negative cor-

relation (-1) or independence (0) between the users'

behavior features

belonging to the pair of roles

fj , fk

under consideration. Here, we assume that a pair of

roles may be mined from a collaborative search ses-

sion only if users' behaviors are dierent and oppo-

site. For instance, the Gatherer and Surveyor roles [24]

are dierentiated considering the fact that the Gath-

erer seeks highly relevant documents and thus formu-

lates queries with a higher overlap than the Surveyor

whereas the Surveyor spends less time on Webpages

favoring the exploration of the information space, and

accordingly the average value of query success is lower,

than the Gatherer. Simply having behavior dier-

ences for these two features is not enough because

what if the same person is better at both? There-

fore, a negative correlation between these behaviors

is considered to ensure that both the behaviors are

found dierently in both the users. Accordingly, we

can define the related pair of roles through: (1) neg-

ative correlation between the query word overlap and

spent time on Webpages features, (2) negative corre-

lation between query word overlap and query success

features. Thus, we define the pattern kernel K as the

set of feature pairs highlighted as negatively correlated

where KR1,2 = {(

); ( R1,2

) = 1}.

4. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
Experimental evaluation is based on two collaborative IR user studies. This section describes these studies, the CIR tasks, the data collected, and the evaluation metrics used.

ing exceptions: (1) the exploratory task focused on "global warming"; (2) the collaborative information system allowed saving of snippets and not pages as bookmarks; (3) participants disposed of 30 minutes for solving the exploratory task; and (4) participants disposed of co-located computers.
4.1.2 Document Dataset
In order to perform the system-mediated setting, we built a unique document index for the two user studies including: (1) visited pages of the whole set of participants of both user studies; and (2) top 100 Google search results of queries submitted by the whole set of participants. The top search results are extracted using the Google Custom Search API1. We, thus, obtained a dataset with 74,844 distinct Webpages. The datasets were then parsed to extract title and main content from the Webpages.

4.1 Data Acquisition and Processing
4.1.1 User Studies
We consider two user studies, involving pairs of users, recruited at Rutgers University. All of them are students and got compensation for their participation. The search tasks consisted of writing a report on an exploratory topic. Throughout the whole session, participants had the possibility to refine their information need by exploring and reformulating queries dealing with the topic. Each task was supported by a collaborative information system [23], which includes a chat system and search tools enabling participants to bookmark Webpages and save snippets. Participants were allowed to compile snippets for building the final report. In the background, the system recorded search log data, such as visited and bookmarked pages, saved through snippets and submitted queries. Statistics about the both datasets are presented in Table 1. We notice that the repeatability of query words represents the average occurrence number of each word included in a query over the whole set of queries. For instance, in the dataset US1, a query includes in average 5 words and each of them are generally used within 182 other queries. This underlines the fact that queries are mainly issued from a reformulation process. Below, we highlight the specificities of each user study:
US1. This study involved 60 dyads working on the exploratory topic of "Gulf oil spill". Participants were given 25 minutes for synchronously working on the exploratory search task and writing the report. The participants were randomly assigned to co-located or remote settings.
US2. This study involved 10 dyads in which participants are distinct to those implied in the first user study. The study setup was similar to the previous one with the follow-

4.1.3 Search Session Features

From search log data, we extracted three categories of fea-

tures, summarized in Table 2, characterizing participants'

search actions. The first category analyzes the query sub-

mission process of each participant, for instance by empha-

sizing if he is better devoted to formulating queries depend-

ing on his intent level of submitting a query, modeled by his

query number or if he is looking for diversity with respect to

his used vocabulary within the successive submitted queries,

modeled by his query overlap value. In addition, we also

identified features based on query length and query success.

We assume that a query is successful if the retrieved pages

are visited for over 30 seconds. The second category anal-

yses browsing behavior related to Webpages. For instance,

we can analyze with the page dwell time if one participant

spends a lot of time for reading one page or not. The num-

ber of visited pages, whether normalized by the number of

submitted queries or not, shows if a participant is more will-

ing to read a lot of documents. The last category analyses

the snippet-based browsing behaviors emphasizing if users

are more willing to find interesting documents. During our

role mining methodology, we estimate the feature value for

a [0; ] time-window for each timestamp .

4.2 Roles
In accordance to the literature review, we consider the two role-based collaborative ranking models modeling the Gatherer/Surveyor roles [24] and the Prospector/Miner roles [20].
The Gatherer and Surveyor roles are dierent considering the fact that the Gatherer seeks for highly relevant documents and thus formulates queries with a higher overlap

than the Surveyor whereas the Surveyor spends less time on Webpages favoring the exploration of the information space, and accordingly the average value of query success is lower, than the Gatherer. Thus, we can define the related role pattern through: (1) negative correlation between the query word overlap and spent time on Webpages features; (2) negative correlation between query word overlap and query success features. The role attribution function underlying this couple of roles specifies that the user with the higher query overlap feature value will be assigned to the role of Gatherer whereas the other one will be detected as the Surveyor.
The main dierence between the roles of Prospector and Miner remains on the task performed by each user. The Prospector's task is more devoted for reformulating queries in order to get result diversity whereas the Miner is looking for relevant documents. Consequently, we can expect for these roles to have a negative correlation between query overlap and number of submitted queries features. The underlying role attribution function specifies that the user characterized by the most important number of submitted queries will be assigned to the role of Prospector whereas the other one will be detected as the Miner.
4.3 Protocol Design and Baselines
We divided the collaborative search sessions into regular timestamps of sixty seconds enabling us to detect users' search actions dierences, and accordingly to predict their roles within collaboration. We perform the following evaluation protocol:
1. For each timestamp t, mine roles that users are performing using our methodology detailed in Section 3.
2. If a role pattern is detected, use the queries submitted between timestamps t and t + 1 with these dierent models:
· BM25-CIR: the BM25 baseline ranking model on each single query submitted by one of the two users. This scenario aims at simulating the user-driven session in which users perform collaboration by means of independent search engines.
· GS-CIR: The Gatherer/Surveyor baseline collaborative ranking model in order to evaluate the impact of considering a system-mediated collaborative ranking model, namely the Gatherer/Surveyor one [24] not necessarily connected with users' search behaviors.
· PM-CIR: The Prospector/Miner baseline collaborative ranking model in order to evaluate the impact of considering a system mediated collaborative ranking

model, namely the Prospector/Miner one [20] not necessarily connected with users' search behaviors.

· Ra-CIR: The random baseline mining model in order to evaluate the impact of a random version of a user driven system mediated CIR setting in which roles are randomly mined or not. For this purpose, we randomly launch either the BM25 model, the Prospector/Miner one [20] or the Gatherer/Surveyor one [24].

· RB-CIR: Role-based model as proposed in this paper. The model requires a couple of queries, respectively for each user. Thus, at each time a query is submitted by a user, we identify the last query submitted by the other user. Both queries are inputs of the CIR model. In the case of any role is detected, we launched the BM25 ranking model.

4.4 Metrics
For each dataset, we build the ground truth by considering the whole set of distinct documents which have been visited by at least two dierent users as relevant. Using this process, we obtained 159 and 47 relevant documents for dataset US1 and US2 respectively.
We used collaborative-based metrics aiming at emphasizing the retrieval-based synergic eect of the collaboration [22]. Considering our CIR setting, we computed these metrics at the timestamp level as follows:

5. RESULTS
In this section we present and discuss results, divided in three categories: those measuring dierences between users, those analyzing the extracted roles, and those evaluating the eectiveness of role mining for CIR.
5.1 Analyzing Users' Differences
Regarding the first stage of our methodology, we analyzed the evolving user search actions using the features presented in Table 2. Table 3 illustrates the average absolute dierences observed between collaborators of each group according to each user study with respect to features involved in role patterns presented in Section 4.2, namely the query success (QS), the number of submitted queries (QN), the query overlap (QO) and the dwell time of visited pages (DWP) at each timestamp, from 1 to 30.
We can see from this table that, for the whole set of features, absolute dierences among collaborators of at least one group are highlighted as positive and significant in the beginning of the session after the first minute. Therefore, significance of collaborators' search behavior dierences

arises the assumption that users are dierent early in the session and provide the foundation to our role mining methodology. This statement is reinforced by the fact that from 75% to 100% of the collaborative groups are characterized by significant dierences between collaborators after 5 minutes.

5.2 Analyzing the Mined Role Changes
In this section, we study how our proposed role mining methodology acts in the collaborative search setting. For this purpose, we define three metrics aiming at measuring the changes of mined roles within a search session:

1. The number of role couples, noted

,

Ncouples

normalized by the number of timestamps, respectively 25

and 30 for US1 and US2, for analyzing the stability of

users' behavior dierences throughout the search session.

More particularly, it measures the number of changes

within chronologically mined couples of roles, for which we

add the couple of role mined for the first timestamp. We

assume that there is a change when, from timestamp to t
timestamp + 1, the roles assigned to the pair of users are t
dierent. A value close to 1 means that the detected couples

of roles are dierent for each two successive timestamps

while a value close to 0 reflects that the pair of users have

constant behaviors throughout the search process.

2. The number of distinct roles, noted

,

Nroles

assigned to a particular user, throughout the search session

also normalized by the number of timestamps. We consider

five possibilities of individual roles: Prospector, Miner,

Gatherer, Surveyor or nothing. We note that the maximum

value, highlighting that a user is detected performing each

of these five roles in a session, is 0 2 for US1 and 0 16 for US2.

.

.

3. The couple-role ratio, noted

, which helps to

Rchange

analyze if, for the same detected couple of roles at two dif-

ferent timestamps within the search session, the same role

is assigned to the same user or if behaviors have changed

to what extend roles of collaborators became opposite. For

491

instance, a user might be Prospector in the beginning of the

session and Miner at the end. For this purpose, we compute

the ratio

of the number of role couples

and

Rchange

Ncouples

the number of distinct roles

for each collaborative

Nroles

search session. A value equals to 1 highlights that, even

if the assigned couple of roles to the pair of users varies

and is redundant throughout the session, roles within a cou-

ple are steadily assigned to the same user. In other words,

when a user is detected as a Gatherer at one timestamp of t
the session, if the Gatherer-Surveyor couple is again mined at timestamp 0, this user will be still detected as a Gath-
t
erer. A value lower than 1 for a collaborative group reflects

that, for at least one couple of roles detected at two dier-

ent timestamps, each user received successively the dierent

associated roles, e.g. Gatherer at timestamp and Surveyor t
at timestamp 0. In contrast, a ratio value is lower than 1 t
means that the couples of roles detected for the group varies

more than the evolution of users' search behaviors when the

same couple of roles is detected.

Table 4 gives statistics of these metrics for both datasets.

More particularly, we computed the average value and the

range, under the format "average [min max]".

Table 4: Analysis of the evolution of mined roles throughout the search session.

Ncouples Nroles Rchange

US2 0.08[0 03 0 2]
.. 0.09[0 04 0 16]
.. 1.18[0.5 1.5]

We can see from Table 4 that, for both user studies, (1) the

low number of changes in terms of couples

and dis-

Ncouples

tinct roles

and (2) the couple-role ratio value

Nroles

Rchange

very close to 1, highlight a certain stability in roles assigned,

first, to the pair of users, and second, to the individual users

themselves.

Indeed, the normalized number

of couples, re-

Ncouples

spectively 0.13 and 0.08 for US1 and US2, reflects that gen-

eral search behaviors of the pairs are stable over the session.

We notice that participants' behaviors of the first user study

US1 are less stable than the second one US2 as we detected

more changes in terms of mined couples of roles. Both user

studies have equivalent results in terms of distinct role num-

ber mined for individual user with a value equal to 0.09.

Thus, statements are slightly opposite, although both close

to 1, with respect to the couple-role ratio for both user stud-

ies: pairs of participants in US1 are slightly more variant in

terms of global search behaviors than individual ones which

means to what extend we detected more mined couples of

roles than for the roles assignment for a solely participant.

In contrast, in US2, users' intrinsic search behaviors fluctu-

ate more than mined couples of roles in so far as that, for the

same couple of roles detected at two dierent timestamps,

the same user was labelled dierently.

This analysis lets us explore if the time window of the role

detection impacts the retrieval eectiveness of such CIR sce-

nario. To this aim, we estimated the retrieval eectiveness of

our role-based CIR scenarios, noted

by computing

RB-CIR

the role mining methodology for a time window from 1 to 5

minutes. Table 5 illustrates the obtained results considering

the F-measure. Beforehand, we highlight that metric val-

ues are low due to the small number of relevant documents

building the relevance judgement for each dataset. We can notice from Table 5 that, for the user study US2, even if the retrieval eectiveness seems to be higher for a 5-minutes time window, results are not significantly dierent due to the low number of groups. However, in the first user study, namely US1, the optimal time window is 1 minute. The analysis of student statistical tests highlights that the 1-minute time window-based retrieval eectiveness is significantly higher ( 0 05) than the other settings; and settings based on p< . 2, 3, 4 or 5 minutes are not statistically significant between each other. This shows that, even if the mined roles rolecouples do not vary significantly a lot, it remains however more eective to propose a mining for each minute in order to better fit users' search behaviors and therefore optimize the collaboration within the search session. For this reason, in the remainder of the paper, we consider a 1-minute time window for mining roles of collaborators.

US2 0.07061 0.06683 0.06931 0.06650 0.07203

We also performed a correlation analysis among the couple-role ratio and the F-measure. Results showed non significant correlations among the involved variables: respectively 0.003 and -0.003 for both dataset US1 and US2. This highlights that the retrieval eectiveness of our proposed CIR setting based on role mining does not depend on the number of distinct mined roles for a user, but rather on adapting the ranking model to users' search behaviors.
5.3 Effectiveness Evaluation

5.3.1 Evaluating the Global Retrieval Effectiveness

Here, we measure and discuss the impact of role mining

on the overall retrieval eectiveness of a collaborative search

session. To this aim, we average, for each metric, their values

over the whole set of participant groups. Significance level

used in our methodology is fixed to = 0 05. .
Table 6 shows the comparative results between the re-

trieval eectiveness of our role-based CIR setting, noted

, and the four baseline settings, namely

,

RB-CIR

BM25-CIR

,

and

, described in Section 4.3.

GS-CIR PM-CIR Ra-CIR

Results highlight significant improvements for most of the

collaborative-based retrieval measures. For user study US1,

mining users' roles significantly enhance the retrieval eec-

tiveness of the overall session from +10.408% to +18.316% for the precision metrics, except a non significant decrease

for the Prospector-Miner-based CIR scenario. In contrast,

the improvements for user study US2 are less significant due

to the fact that this study involves less collaborative ses-

sions and therefore, the significance of student test is more

di cult to reach. Nevertheless, we obtained significant im-

provements from 52 786% to 63 818% with respect to the

.

.

baseline setting.

GS-CIR

More generally, we notice the following general trends for

both datasets:

· Leveraging from role mining within a CIR search session overpasses the aggregation of an individual scenario highlighted by the BM25-CIR baseline. This

shows the necessity of leveraging from collaborative search settings by analyzing users' dierences and mining their roles in order to optimize the collaboration.
· Our role-based CIR scenario provides better results than the scenario relying only on the GathererSurveyor collaborative ranking model. This highlights that our proposed scenario is better adapted to the constant setting of the Gatherer-Surveyor CIR model which only merges and splits search results retrieved from the last submitted queries of users.
· The Prospector-Miner algorithm seems to provide better results than our scenario, however these improvements are not significant for both datasets. One possible explanation of an equivalent retrieval eectiveness as our proposed scenario might be that the ProspectorMiner CIR model analyzes the retrieved documents and submitted queries from the beginning of the session for providing optimized document rankings. Similarly, our role mining methodology also rests on users' actions from the beginning of the session for proposing a better adapted CIR ranking model.
· Our role mining methodology seems to be more eective than a scenario in which roles are assigned randomly. This emphasizes the reliability of our methodology for mining roles which seems to accurately match users' search behaviors, and accordingly optimize the collaboration.

Thus, we can conclude that mining roles within a collaborative search session optimizes the collaboration and improves the synergic eect of collaborators.

5.3.2 Evaluating the Timestamp-based Retrieval Ef-

fectiveness

Our objective here is to analyze more in-depth retrieval

eectiveness across time of our proposed methodology-based

Equation 7. Figure 1 illustrates the retrieval eectiveness

for the five settings according to each timestamp of the

search session. For the first user study, namely US1, the

curve representing system-driven approach surrounded by

role mining, namely

, generally overpasses the base-

RB-CIR

line curves. This statement is more slightly identifiable in

Figure 1b due to the low number of collaborative groups de-

tected as performing a couple of roles for a particular times-

tamp. Therefore, dierences between RB-CIR and baseline settings are more variable and non-significant. Neverthe-

less, we can conclude that mining roles generally optimizes

the collaboration throughout the search process. Moreover,

graphics highlight that the eectiveness of our method seems

to decrease at the end of the session. It can be explained

by the fact that sessions were fixed and quite long, between

25 and 30 minutes, and we noticed during user studies that

participants were less involved in the task at the end of the

493

session. We can assume, therefore, that the cognitive eort for reformulating queries was higher which may negatively impact the information need expression, and therefore, the reliability of mined roles in this unstable context.

6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Collaboration can be a useful strategy in many situations, including information retrieval. As researchers have shown [20], using collaboration one could achieve something greater than the sum of individual searchers' contributions. A way to achieve this synergy is by leveraging diverse sets of skills brought by dierent people [22].
In this paper, we proposed a user-driven system-mediated approach for mining organically emerging user roles and using that information to improve upon various aspects of retrieval performance including relevance and novelty. Specifically, we presented a new role mining methodology that helps us understand how two searchers collaborating in an exploratory search task are dierent. Using this knowledge, we were able to suggest roles for these users to follow for the rest of their search sessions. Using simulations on two dierent user study datasets for what would happen if such suggestions were followed, we were able to show promising results highlighting the benefit of role mining.
This work has a few limitations. For instance, it assumes that a user's role or in general search behavior can be extracted using his actions. The proposed algorithm also ignores any prior knowledge or preferences about the users. This limitation can be addressed by creating a hybrid model that takes into consideration a user's past behavior and preferences, in addition to current actions during a search session. For the future work, we also plan to derive role patterns through the users' search session relying on meta-roles, not necessarily defined within a role taxonomy.
