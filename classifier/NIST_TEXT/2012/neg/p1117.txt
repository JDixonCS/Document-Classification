ABSTRACT
It has been previously noted that optimization of the ncall@k relevance objective (i.e., a set-based objective that is 1 if at least n documents in a set of k are relevant, otherwise 0) encourages more result set diversification for smaller n, but this statement has never been formally quantified. In this work, we explicitly derive the mathematical relationship between expected n-call@k and the relevance vs. diversity trade-off -- through fortuitous cancellations in the resulting combinatorial optimization, we show the trade-off is a simple and intuitive function of n (notably independent of the result set size k  n), where diversification increases as n  1.

1. RELEVANCE VS. DIVERSITY

Subtopic retrieval -- "the task of finding documents that

cover as many different subtopics of a general topic as pos-

sible" [5] -- is a motivating case for diverse retrieval. One of

the most popular result set diversification methods is Maxi-

mal Marginal Relevance (MMR) [1]. Formally, given an item

set D (e.g., a set of documents) where retrieved items are

denoted as si  D, we aim to select an optimal subset of items Sk  D (where |Sk| = k and k < |D|) relevant to a given query q (e.g., query terms) with some level of diversity among the items in Sk. MMR builds Sk in a greedy manner by choosing the next optimal selection sk given the set of k - 1 optimal selections Sk-1 = {s1, . . . , sk-1} (recursively defining Sk = Sk-1  {sk} with S0 = ) as follows:

sk

=

arg max
sk D \Sk-1

))-(1

Here,   [0, 1], metric Sim1 measures query-item relevance,

and metric Sim2 measures the similarity between two items.

Presently, little is formally known about how a particular

selection of  relates to the overall set-based relevance objec-

tive being optimized. However, it has been previously noted

that the n-call@k set-based relevance metric (which is 1 if

at least n documents in a set of k are relevant, otherwise 0)

encourages diversity as n  1 [2, 4]. Indeed, Sanner et al.

[3] have shown that optimizing expected n-call@k for n = 1

corresponds to  = 0.5 -- we extend this derivation to show

that



=

n n+1

for

arbitrary

n

1

(independent

of

set

size k  n). This result precisely formalizes a relationship

between n-call@k and the relevance vs. diversity trade-off.

2. RELEVANCE MODEL AND OBJECTIVE
We review the probabilistic subtopic model of binary relevance from [3] shown as a directed graphical model in Figure 1. Shaded nodes represent observed variables, unshaded nodes are latent. Observed variables are the query terms q and selected items si (where for 1  i  k, si  D). For the subtopic variables, let T be a discrete subtopic set. Then ti  T represent subtopics for respective si and t  T represents a subtopic for query q. The ri are {0, 1} variables that indicate if respective selected items si are relevant (ri = 1).
The conditional probability tables (CPTs) are as follows: P (ti|si) and P (t|q) respectively represent the subtopic distribution for item si and query q. For the ri CPTs, using I[·] as a {0, 1} indicator function (1 if · is true), item si is deemed relevant iff its subtopic ti matches query subtopic t:

P (ri = 1|t, ti) = I[ti = t]

We

next

define

Rk

=

Pk
i=1

ri

,

where

Rk

is

the

number

of

relevant items from the first k selections. Reading Rk  n

as I[Rk  n], we express the expected n-call@k objective as

Exp-n-Call@k(Sk, q) = E[Rk  n|s1, . . . , sk, q].

3. MAIN DERIVATION AND RESULT
Taking MMR's greedy approach, we select sk given Sk-1:1
sk = arg max E[Rk  n|Sk-1, sk, q]
sk
= arg max P (Rk  n|Sk-1, sk, q)
sk

This query can be evaluated w.r.t. our latent subtopic binary

relevance model in Figure 1 as follows, where we marginalize

out all non-query, nPon-evideP ncePvariablePs Tk and define Tk = {t, t1, . . . , tk} and Tk  = t t1 · · · tk :

We split Rk  n into two disjoint (additive) events (rk  0,Rk-1  n), (rk=1,Rk-1=n-1) where all ri are D-separated:

Next we proceed to drop the first summand since it is not a

function of sk (i.e., it has no influence in determining sk): X
=arg max P (t|q)P (tk = t|sk)P (Rk-1= n-1|Sk-1) (2)

sk

t

By similar reasoning, we can derive that the last probability

needed in (2) is recursively defined as P (Rk = n|Sk, t) =

8 >>>>><n  1, k > 1 :

>>>>>:nn

0, k 1, k

P (t1 = t|s1)

1 - P (t1 = t|s1)

We can now rewrite (2) by unrolling its recursive definition. For expected n-call@k where n  k/2 (a symmetrical result holds for k/2 < n  k), the explicit unrolled objective is

where j1, . . . , jn-1  {1, . . . , k - 1} satisfy that ji < ji+1 (i.e., an ordered permutation of n - 1 result set indices).
1We present a derivation summary; A full derivation may be found in an online appendix at the authors' web pages.

If we assume each document covers a single subtopic of the

query (e.g., a subtopic represents an intent of an ambiguous

query) then we can assume that i P (ti|siQ)  {0, 1} and P (t|q)  {0, 1}. This allows us to convert a to a max

Assuming m selected top term (specifically
