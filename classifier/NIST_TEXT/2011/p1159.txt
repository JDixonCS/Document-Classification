ABSTRACT
The common tags given by multiple users to a particular document are often semantically relevant to the document and each tag represents a specific topic. In this paper, we attempt to emulate human tagging behavior to recommend tags by considering the concepts contained in documents. Specifically, we represent each document using a few most relevant concepts contained in the document, where the concept space is derived from Wikipedia. Tags are then recommended based on the tag concept model derived from the annotated documents of each tag. Evaluated on a Delicious dataset of more than 53K documents, the proposed technique achieved comparable tag recommendation accuracy as the state-of-the-art, while yielding an order of magnitude speed-up.

1. INTRODUCTION
Digital resources are increasingly being organized, summarized, shared and searched using tagging mechanisms. Consequently, there is immense research interest in efficient and effective tag recommendation techniques to boost manual tagging to cope with the continuously growing amount of digital data being produced.
In collaborative tagging, often, people emulate or share others' tagging behavior. As a result, semantically relevant tags emerge as the prominent tags with top frequency of occurrences, and a small set of common tags are typically reused to represent specific topics, which is known as semantic tags [2,5]. Semantic tags are normally common nouns and proper names (75.63% and 70.10% respectively), belonging mainly to the category of topic which describes what a tagged resource (e.g., a document) is about [1]. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that a user subconsciously considers the concepts covered by a document when she is tagging that document.

In this paper, we attempt to emulate human tagging behavior, in that, people annotate semantic tags based on the concepts underlying a document and the semantic tags associated with these concepts. Specifically, we adopt a probabilistic framework to model a web document by its contained concepts and the likelihood of the semantic tags representing these concepts for tag recommendation. In our implementation, the concepts are derived from Wikipedia by taking each Wikipedia article as a concept.
Evaluated on a Delicious dataset containing more than 53K documents, our tag recommendation technique achieved comparable accuracy as state-of-the-art techniques, but yields a significant speedup. This suggests that a small number of concepts contained in a document are effective in conveying the meaning of the document for meaningful tag recommendation. The concise concept-based representation against the commonly adopted uni-gram representation contributes to the speed-up.

2. CONCEPT MODEL

The key of the concept model is to represent a document using a

small set of concepts contained in the document. In our implemen-

tation, the concept space is derived from Wikipedia, which is the

largest knowledge repository. Each Wikipedia article (i.e., article

title) defines one concept.

Given a document, all keyphrases, each of which refers to at least

one Wikipedia article, contained in the document are first identified

through string matching. The extracted keyphrases are ranked by

their keyphraseness, the priori probability that a keyphrase is used

as anchor text of the wikilinks, no matter where it appears [4]. The

lower-ranked keyphrases are then pruned for two reasons. First, the

lower-ranked keyphrases are often not strongly related to any con-

cepts, and hence are less effective in conveying the meaning of the

document. Second, the pruning leads to a more concise representa-

tion of the document, enabling more efficient tag recommendation.

The pruning is controlled by a parameter (prune ratio) set based on

a validation set. Then, since a keyphrase may match multiple con-

cepts, we apply word sense disambiguation [3] to derive the correct

concepts under the context of the document of interest.

With concept based document representation, we adopt Equa-

tion 1 for semantic tag recommendation, where P(t|d) is the likeli-

hood that a tag t represents the meaning conveyed by document d,

P(t|c) is the likelihood that tag t represents concept c, and P(c|d)

denotes representativeness of concept c to document d.



P(t|d) = P(t|c)P(c|d)

c

The tag recommendation problem is then to pick the top-k tags with the highest P(t|d) values. We next discuss the estimation of P(c|d) and P(t|c) respectively.

Let f (d, c) be the number of times concept c appears in document d. P(c|d) is estimated by the concept's relative frequency with Jelinek-Mercer smoothing, shown in Equation 2. In this equation,   [0, 1] is a smoothing parameter and P(c|D) is the maximum likelihood estimate of concept c in the entire collection D.

The probability P(t|c) is estimated through the concept model of

tag t

(i.e.,

P(c|t)) by

Bayes'

theorem:

P(t|c)

=

P(c|t) P(c)

P(t

).

While

P(c)

and P(t) can be easily estimated based on their corresponding fre-

quencies in the collection, the estimation of P(c|t) is not straight-

forward. Let Dt be the set of documents annotated by tag t. We

build the concept model of tag t by a weighted concatenation of the

concepts appearing in Dt , shown in Equation 3.



P^(c|t)

ddDtDwt w(d(,dt,)tf)(fd(,dc,)c)

In this equation, w(d, t) denotes the relevance or representativeness

of document d towards tag t. Note that, many documents may carry

the same tag, and a particular document may have multiple tags

with varying frequencies given by multiple users (e.g., Delicious).

Let Td denote the set of tags assigned to document d, and f (d, t) be the number of times tag t  Td is assigned to d by (multiple) users. We consider four schemes to compute w(d, t), summarized

in Equation 4, where f (t) is the frequency of tag t in the entire

collection. The four schemes are: (i) Uniform Weighting (UW)

where uniform weight of 1.0 is used, (ii) Document Perspective

Weighting (DP) where w(d, t) is the relative frequency of t assigned

to d, (iii) Tag Perspective Weighting (TP) where w(d, t) is the ratio

of t being used to annotate d, and (iv) Document & Tag Perspective

Weighting (DTP) which combines DP and TP.

3. EXPERIMENTS
Dataset. We evaluate the proposed concept based tag recommendation using Delicious dataset comprising 144, 574 documents and 67, 104 distinct tags [7]. After removing very short and unpopular documents (i.e., less than 100 words and less than 50 users), the remaining 53, 550 documents were randomly split into three sets: 49, 550 for model training, 1, 000 for parameter validation (e.g., prune ratio, smoothing parameter), and 3, 000 for performance evaluation. The concept space was derived from Wikipedia dump created on 12 March 2010.
Methods. Three baseline methods are compared in our experiments. The naïve baseline is to recommend the most popular tags (MPT) to all documents. The state-of-the-art baseline is the one based on language generative model (TPL) reported very recently in [6]. To evaluate the effectiveness of the notion of concept, another set of baseline methods are designed by replacing concept by utenni-agsraPm(t(|di.e).,=wordwsP)(itn|wth)Pe(dwo|cdu)m. eCnotsu.pTlehdenwEitqhutahteiofno1uriswreewigrhitt-ing schemes in Equation 4, we use CM+{UW, DP, TP, DTP} and UM+{UW, DP, TP, DTP} to denote the four methods using concept model and uni-gram model respectively.
Performance Metrics. The recommendation accuracy is measured by NDCG@N and Precision@N. NDCG@N measures the consistency between the top-N recommended tag ranking and the ground

truth tag ranking by users [5]. Precision@N (or Prec@N) is the ratio of tags indeed used by users among the top-N recommended tags. The execution time is also reported and all experiments were conducted on the same environment.
Recommendation Accuracy. Table 1 reports the performance of all methods in terms of NDCG@{5, 10} and Prec@{5, 10}. For each metric, the best performing method is highlighted in boldface and the second best is underlined. Observe that: (i) unsurprisingly, the simple MPT performs the worst by all measures; (ii) all concept model based methods outperform uni-gram based methods significantly by all measures, regardless of weighting scheme used; (iii) among concept based methods, CM+DTP is the winner in terms of NDCG@{5, 10} and CM+UW performed the worst in both metrics. (iv) comparing with the state-of-the-art TPL, CM+DTP achieves better NDCG@5 significantly and marginal improvement in NDCG@10. Although TPL yields better Prec@{5, 10}, a close investigation reveals that many tags recommended by TPL are of low frequency, which may only benefit a small group of users. This is also reflected by NDCG@{5, 10} as NDCG measures consider tag frequency in the evaluation and tags with higher frequencies are given more weights in the measure.
Execution Time. The average tagging time of UM+DTP, TPL and CM+DTP were 21.30, 22.23 & 2.50 seconds respectively. Note that the tagging time for CM+DTP includes concept detection time. That is, concept model based method incurs an order of magnitude computation cost reduction.
4. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a semantic tag recommendation mechanism based on concept model. The concept model enables a concise representation of documents by considering only a few concepts most relevant to the documents. Comparing with the stateof-the-art, our method achieved comparable tag recommendation accuracy but yield a significant speed-up. Our future work is aimed at incorporating the concept model with other approaches for better tag recommendation accuracy.
