ABSTRACT
As digital collections expand, the importance of the temporal aspect of information has become increasingly apparent. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of using long-term temporal profiles of terms in information retrieval by enhancing the term selection process of pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF). For this purpose, two temporal PRF approaches were introduced considering only temporal aspect and temporal along with textual aspect. Experiments used the AP88-89 and WSJ87-92 test collections with TREC AdHoc Topics 51-100. Term temporal profiles are extracted from the Google Books n-grams dataset. The results show that the long-term temporal aspects of terms are capable of enhancing retrieval effectiveness.

1. INTRODUCTION
The significance of time has been examined from a number of information retrieval (IR) perspectives including temporal document relevance [3], event detection in user-generated content, query log trend analysis and topic bursting in stream collections. However, work on temporally-sensitive retrieval has relied upon relatively short-term or otherwise limited time-stamped document collections such as those of the early TREC news or journal collections. Many documents without time-stamp information (e.g., web documents) still contain topics which are implicitly temporally-sensitive. Furthermore, such short-term collections have little coverage of long-term lexical dynamics [4] that could be used in a temporal relevance model. `Culturomics' [5] quantitatively measures the rise and fall in terms of bursts and trends in the use of words and phrases over long periods as a consequence of changing political, economic, sociocultural and technological trends and events causing lexical evolution.
One of the aspects of IR for which temporal information could be of benefit is pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF). Users often submit short and simple queries. Likewise, many short queries may indicate significant temporal composition of the result sets [3]. The objective of PRF is to increase the effectiveness of retrieval by expanding the original query terms with frequent or distinctive terms from the

top pseudo-relevant documents of the initial result set. As such, PRF effectiveness is highly dependent on the quality of both initially retrieved documents and the term selection techniques used. Much research has been dedicated to optimising term selection in PRF, however, correlation between terms based on a long-term temporal profile (see Section 2.1) has yet to be studied. In this work we propose using the long-term temporal profile correlation between terms from the pseudo-relevant documents and temporally significant query terms to improve PRF term selection.
2. APPROACH
2.1 Temporal Pseudo-Relevance Feedback
With the effectiveness of PRF significantly depending on the quality of the selected terms from the pseudo-relevant documents [1], we propose two approaches in which the temporal aspect of the terms are taken into account. Unlike traditional PRF, which ranks possible expansion terms by their frequency (TF) in the retrieved documents, i.e. PRF(Text), our first approach, ignores TF and instead ranks terms by their temporal profile correlation with the most temporally significant term extracted from the query, i.e. PRF(Temporal). The temporal correlation (T C) is computed as the Pearson's correlation coefficient between each term's temporal profile (explained below). Our second approach, PRF(Text+Temporal), combines both techniques by ranking terms by T C × T F .
The temporal profile of a term over a prolonged period could be mined from a large scale time-stamped collection, however not all collections include time-stamps, and those which do are not always accurate. We propose to use the Google Books (GB) n-gram dataset1 [5] for obtaining temporal profiles. Whilst the temporal resolution is coarse (annual occurrence), books are likely to have good coverage of significant temporal words and phrases. To the best of our knowledge this is a first attempt to use this dataset for improving information retrieval.
To use the GB dataset, we have to extract descriptive ngrams from the query (in our case TREC topic title) and the pseudo-relevant documents. The Yahoo Term Extraction Service2 was used for this purpose.
At this stage we consider the extracted topic title term

with the highest kurtosis3 as the primary clue of a topic's long-term temporality. We therefore select the topic n-gram with the highest kurtosis to temporally correlate with potential PRF terms found in pseudo-relevant documents. Pearson's correlation is used to calculate temporal similarity [2] between document and query term temporal profiles.
3. EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS
Implementation. Documents were indexed using Indri 5.04 with standard stop-word removal and Krovetz stemming applied. The top 1000 documents were retrieved for each topic using a unigram language model with Indri default Dirichlet smoothing ( = 2500). This run formed the baseline (identified as LM in Table 1) against which we compared three PRF approaches. For comparison, we also report the performance of PRF(Text) as a much stronger baseline. In each PRF approach, the top n temporally correlated or frequent terms (with n = 10, 20) in the top 10 retrieved documents were linearly-combined and used to expand the query5. To reduce query drift, the expanded query includes the original query terms weighted at 0.7, with possibly nonrelevant PRF expansion terms weighted at 0.3.
The GB data was indexed, making n-grams case-insensitive. The temporal profile for each term from 1950-1994 was obtained from the GB index (aligning with test collection periods). Due to computational time and space limitations we only used 1 and 2-grams in this study.
Experiment Settings. Preliminary evaluation of the PRF technique is performed using the AP88-89 and WSJ8792 test collections with TREC Ad-Hoc topics 51-100. We used a news collection at this stage as it is most likely to contain topics with long-term temporality. Mean average precision (MAP) for the top 1000 documents is used as the main effectiveness evaluation measure. Precision at 30 (P@30) and Recall have been included to observe whether PRF increases recall at the cost of precision [1]. We also include Improvement metric (IMP) [6] as the number of individual topics with improved MAP over the LM baseline, as to analyse per-topic variation.
Results. The results reported in Table 1 show that the temporal aspect of the terms can improve retrieval effectiveness. The temporal-based approach displays better perfor-

mances than LM. We also observe that combining temporal and textual aspects of terms in PRF documents leads to the best performance (shown to be statistically significant), increasing over that of PRF(Text) alone. Thus, whilst effectiveness gains are marginal on average in this preliminary study, there is a case for using the long-term temporal correlation of terms in PRF term selection, particularly when considering individual topic improvements (i.e. IMP). Improvement gain across approaches is due to a significant variation in the selected terms as reflected by a per-topic average Spearman's  of 0.05 and 0.06 for AP88-89 and WSJ87-92 respectively.
4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we investigated the effectiveness of using long-term temporal aspects of terms in PRF. The results are encouraging and show improvment when including temporal profile correlation in PRF term selection. This work is a foundation for future research on utilising long-term temporality in IR tasks. Future work will answer what the effect would be of such information if it is combined with textual features using more elaborate PRF models.
