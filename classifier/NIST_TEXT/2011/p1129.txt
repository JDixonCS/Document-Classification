ABSTRACT
Web content quality assessment is a typical static ranking problem. Heuristic content and TFIDF features based statistical systems have proven effective for Web content quality assessment. But they are all language dependent features, which are not suitable for cross-language ranking. In this paper, we fuse a series of language-independent features including hostname features, domain registration features, twolayer hyperlink analysis features and third-party Web service features to assess the Web content quality. The experiments on ECML/PKDD 2010 Discovery Challenge cross-language datasets show that the assessment is effective.

1. INTRODUCTION
Web content quality assessment is a typical static ranking (query-independent ranking) problem [1], which is crucial to search engine, Web archiving and Internet directory, etc. Web quality assessment can also be applied to domain abuse detection to reduce false positive rate of the detection model.
In 2010, Andra´s A. et al [2] released a dataset for Web quality assessment; based on the dataset, ECML/PKDD 2010 Discovery Challenge(DC2010) was held. As multilingualism is imperative on the Web, the DC2010 involves a multilingual task and expects language-independent features to be used to classify the French and German language test sets. How to extract effective features to train a model for multi-language Web content quality prediction is a challenge and interesting topic. In DC2010, NLP, hyperlink, content and TFIDF features were used, among them heuristical content features and TFIDF features have proven the most ef-

fective features for English quality assessment [3] [5]. Yet, as language dependent features, content and TFIDF features are unfit for cross-language quality assessment.
Richardson M. et al [1] proposed Feature Based Static Ranking and claimed that they outperformed PageRank. In their work, most features are heuristic content attributes, such as page and anchor text; and the popularity feature is impracticable for most of researchers, as it is the commercial service data; also, they do not take Web spam into account, which severely distorts search engines' ranking results.
In the following of this paper, we will extract a series of language-independent features to assess the Web content quality and carry out contrast experiments on DC2010 dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of these features.
2. FEATURES EXTRACTION
In this section, we will describe features used for learning an automatic cross-language Web content assessment model. The extracted features include hostname features, domain registration features, page and host level hyperlink analysis features, and third-party Web service features.
2.1 Hostnames Features
Hostname is usually a combination of local name with its parent domain name, which is a visiting card of various Web services. We will investigate whether the local name length, the hostname length, number of digits, ".", "-" , "year" substring in a hostname, and the top-level domain of a hostname are effective indicators of quality assessment.
2.2 Registration Features
To an approximate degree, registration features can describe "where" a site is registered, "who" owns it, and "when" it is changed. We can get the information of a domain name by WHOIS service. Then, we can map the features of a domain name to the corresponded host. The registration features include: creation date, updated date, expiration date, number of name servers, registrant and registrar, etc.
2.3 Third-party Features
Quite a few Internet services are available today, such as Yahoo! Site Explore (https://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com), Alexa (http://www.alexa.com) and PageRank (http://tool barqueries.google.com). We can get certain information that describes a host. For example, PageRank is one of the most famous link analysis algorithms, which reflects the importance of Web pages; although PageRank becomes unreliable

as a quality measure due to the growing prevalence of link spam [4] [6], it should still be a useful measure for the Web content quality.
For a host, the third-party features include: PageRank and Alexa ranking of the host's corresponded domain, number of inlinks gathered by Yahoo and Alexa, and number of pages indexed by Google and Yahoo.
2.4 Page Level Link Features
The page level hyperlink features used here are provided by the ECML/PKDD 2010 Discovery Challenge organization committee, i.e. link-based features [2]. Given that the transformed feature, such as TrustRank/PageRank, is meaningless for nonlinear classification algorithms, we do not use them in this paper.
2.5 Host Level HyperLink Analysis Features
Based on the common sense that benign sites tend to link to other high quality sites and malicious nodes are mainly linked by low quality nodes, we will extract a series of host level link analysis features to mine the quality relations from the Web topology dependency.
Truncated PageRank (t = 1, 2, 3, 4) [4] (spam detection), HostRank (static ranking) and Estimation of supporters (d = 1, 2, 3, 4) [4] (spam detection) are extracted. Considering the topological dependencies of low and high quality nodes, we also compute their neighbors' weighted mean values just as our previous work [3]. The neighbor relation include inlinks and outlinks, etc. We treat the domainP R used in [3] as a third-party feature.
3. EXPERIMENTS
3.1 Learning Method and Evaluation
In DC2010, modeling via weighted probabilities of samples has proven one of the most effective assessment methods [3]. We adopt this strategy in the following experiments and use the same learning algorithm, i.e. bagging with C4.5. So we can focus on the effectiveness of the extracted features and compare with the DC2010 best results. The iterations of bagging is 90 in our experiments.
NDCG is used as our evaluation criterion, which is also used to evaluate the submissions of DC2010 [2].
3.2 Data Set and Feature Fusion
DC2010 data set consists of 23,808,829 pages, 600 million hyperlinks and 191,388 different hosts [2]. We use the labeled English training data for multilingual Web content quality assessment task (German and French).
We extract 11 HostN ame features (N ), 3 Registration features (R), 6 T hird-P arty features (T ), 45 Host Level Link features (H) and 79 P age Level Link features (P )1. Conducting feature selection with information gain (IG) algorithm on the aforementioned features, we get the F usion features (F ). That is, F = IG(N R T H P ). In our experiments, the dimension of the F usion features is 35.
1We queried the WHOIS and third-party services 2 months after DC2010 release, when some domains had expired. Given that domains with high reputation usually renew in advance, it should not quite affect the assessment results. The registration features include create date, update date and number of name servers.

3.3 Experiment Results
Table 1 gives the comparison of Web content quality assessment performance of different scale features and fusion features for cross language tasks.

0.8049 0.8125 0.8363 0.8336 0.8305 0.8634

We can see that all the features from different scales have assessment ability. Among them, the registration features, third party features and host level link features are more effective for cross-language tasks. We get the best result with fusing all the features. From the Table 1 we can find that the features extracted from different views can be complementary for cross-language Web content quality assessment.
In aforementioned experiments, the labeled German and French samples are not used for training the assessment models. Thus, we only employed the labeled English samples to validate the effectiveness of the extracted features for cross-language static ranking. Even so, the results with fusion features outperform all the final submissions in DC2010, where the best results are DE (0.8545) and FR (0.8362) [5].

4. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have extracted a series of languageindependent features. The experiments show that the proposed method is effective for cross-language assessment.
