ABSTRACT
A blog service company provides a function named BlogCast that exposes quality posts on the blog main page to vitalize a blogosphere. This paper analyzes a new type of information diffusion via BlogCast. We show that there exists a strong halo effect in a blogosphere via thorough investigation on a huge volume of blog data.

1. INTRODUCTION
Owing to the recent advance of Internet technology, content development is being moved rapidly from offline to online. A blog is a personal website where individuals publish their thoughts in a post online. In a blogosphere, people write posts, exchange information, and establish relationships.
There have been a number of research efforts on information diffusion in a blogosphere. They model the blogosphere as a social network, and analyze the network effect on information diffusion [2][3]. A blog service company finds a small number of quality posts that deal with interesting topics and exposes them on the blog main page so that people easily access these posts. This function, referred to as BlogCast, significantly contributes to a vitalization of the blogosphere.
Information diffusion through BlogCast should show unique characteristics because the network effect does not occur anymore. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no such an analysis on information diffusion through broadcasting in a blogosphere. This paper analyzes this new type of information diffusion, and presents interesting implications.
2. TERMINOLOGY
Blog service companies provide useful functions to facilitate communications among bloggers. The trackback is putting links in related posts to each other in order to enable people to read them together. The scrap, unique in Korea, is copying someone else's post into one's own blog.

The blogroll is maintaining a list of addresses of other blogs so that one easily visits them at any time.
Diffusion power (DP ) is a measure that indicates how much a post (or a blogger) influences information diffusion in a blogosphere [2]. In this paper, we define the DP of a post simply as the total number of trackbacks and scraps that the post has received. Likewise, we define the DP of a blog as the sum of DP s of all the posts within the blog.
When a blogosphere is modeled as a network, a blog is represented as a node and a relationship between a pair of blogs is as an edge. Reference [2] regarded the space for the quality posts maintained by BlogCast as a special blog, and referred to this blog as a super node. In this paper, we call a post SN-Post if it has been exposed in a super node, and also call a blog SN-Blog if it has at least an SN-Post. We call the time when a post is added into a super node SN-in time, and the time when it is removed from a super node SN-out time.
3. RESULTS AND ANALYSES
For the analysis, we used anonymized blog data that was collected from blog.naver.com, one of the biggest blogospheres in Korea. The numbers of posts and blogs were about 14 millions and 700 thousands, respectively. Also, the numbers SN-Posts and SN-Blogs were 2,554 and 1,384 respectively.
In Experiment 1, we examined the the correlation between the number of posts in the SN-Blog and the average DP in the scatter plot. Figure 1 shows the result. The X -axis represents the number of posts in the SN-Blog, and the Y axis represents the average DP of the posts in the SN-Blog. Generally, we expected that bloggers who write quality posts write a more number of posts and the post in a SN-Blog with more posts would have a higher DP on average. Contrary to our expectation, however, we found no correlation between the number of posts in the SN-Blog and the average DP of the posts in the SN-Blog. The Pearson coefficient is very low with -0.03.
In Experiment 2, we examined the tendency of the DP of SN-Posts over time. The DP of an individual SN-Post was shown to change quite differently depending on SN-Posts. So, we first grouped SN-Posts according to the month when they were added into the super node, aligned the time axis for the SN-Posts in the same month at the SN-in time, and computed the average DP of SN-Posts in each month for each day.
Figure 2 shows the results for two months. The results for the other months were shown similar, but omitted here due to space limitations. The X -axis represents the relative

days before/after the SN-in time, and the Y -axis represents the average DP of SN-Posts in each day. The value of 0 on the X -axis indicates the SN-in time of each post. The inset depicts the tendency of the DP after the SN-in time in a log-log scale.
We see that the DP increases abruptly up to several hundred times in the day when it becomes an SN-Post. It also decreases drastically within one or two day(s) after the SNin time. This is because an SN-Post is frequently replaced with other posts by a blog service company. As shown in the inset, we observe that the relaxation of the DP follows the well-known power-law distribution whose exponent is between -1.0 and -1.5. This coincides with the results found in a number of natural phenomena [1].

In Experiment 3, we examined the DP of SN-Blogs over time with the experimental settings and methods same as in Experiment 2. Because the DP of an SN-Post is dominant in an SN-Blog, for making the analysis clearer, we excluded the DP of SN-Posts when computing the DP of SN-Blogs. Figure 3 shows the results for the two months.

The DP of SN-Blogs also dramatically increases up to several hundred times in the day when their post is selected as an SN-Post. As the DP of SN-Posts does, the DP of

SN-Blogs shows rapid relaxation within one or two day(s) after the SN-in time.
The abrupt increase of the DP of SN-Blogs can be explained as follows (see Figure 4). When one reads the SNPost via the super node (solid lines), she or he realizes that the SN-Blog has a number of quality posts inside (dashed lines). So, it is likely that she or he scraps or trackbacks those normal posts together. We call this phenomenon that the DP of normal posts within an SN-Blog significantly grows at the SN-in time due to the SN-Post halo effect.

4. CONCLUSIONS
This paper analyzed the BlogCast effect on information diffusion in the blogosphere: We discovered the halo effect that the DP of normal posts (and the relationships) within an SN-Blog dramatically grows at the SN-in time.
