ABSTRACT
In this paper we aim at addressing the correlation between two critical factors in mobile social networks (MSNs): the social-relationship networking among users and the spatial mobility pa ern of users. Speci cally, we investigate the impact of users' spatial distribution on their social relationship formation in MSNs. Based on the geolocation data (check-in records) and social relation data of MSN users, we propose a model, called neighborhood-cardinality-based model (NCBM), to describe this impact by taking into account both the multiple home-points/hotspots property of spatial mobility and the long-tailed social relationship degree distribution of MSN users. We de ne a fundamental quantity for each user, i.e., the so-called neighborhood cardinality, to measure how many and how o en other MSN users visit his nearby area with a given range. e core of NCBM is a principle: e probability that a user, say u, is followed by another user, say , obeys a power law distribution of the neighborhood cardinality of user u. e proposed formation model is evaluated on two large check-in datasets: Brightkite and Gowalla. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed formation model provides a useful paradigm for capturing the correlation between MSN users' mobility pa erns and social relationships.

In this paper we study the correlation between two critical factors in MSNs. e former is a special type of online behaviors, called online social behavior, i.e., the social-relationship networking among users. e la er is an o ine behavior, i.e., the spatial mobility pa ern of users. e correlation between them naturally comes into play when implementing some social-relevant studies on MSNs, e.g., improving information propagation on MSNs and making recommendations among friends with location-based services. Modeling such a correlation is the motivation of this work.
More speci cally, we investigate the spatial distribution of users' followers in MSNs. Based on the check-in records of MSN users, we propose a model, called neighborhood-cardinality-based model (NCBM), to describe the spatial distribution of an MSN user's followers. We evaluate the proposed model by simulating the followership formation process based on two real-life geolocation datasets: Brightkite and Gowalla, with comparisons to the wellknown distance-based model [3] and rank-based model [4]. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed model successfully emulates the social formation mechanism from the perspective of users' geographical distribution.
e rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the directly relevant studies. In Section 3, we present the features of mobile social networks based on observing two real-life geolocation datasets. We model the followership formation in MSNs in Section 4, and give the corresponding evaluation in Section 5. Finally, we draw a conclusion in Section 6.

1 INTRODUCTION
Mobile Internet (MI) provides a way for users to access the cyber space anytime and anywhere. It actually serves as a seamless pipeline connecting di erent spaces, e.g., physical space and cyber space. When daily social activities of people are extended to the cyber space via MI, a promising MI application emerges, i.e., mobile social networks (MSNs). In MSNs, users' behavior usually takes place in a blended form consisting of online behavior and o ine behavior. e correlations between them play an important role in social-relevant research on MSNs, [2, 7].

2 RELATED WORK
Some excellent studies have investigated the correlation between the spatial distribution and social relationship formation of users in online social networks. Kleinberg [3] proposed a distance-based social model relating geographical distance and social followership.
e probability of a user following another user is inversely proportional to the power of the geographical distance between these two users. In [4], Liben-Nowell et al. proposed a rank-based model where the probability of following a particular person is inversely proportional to the power of the number of closer people. ey pointed out that the distance-based models neglect the impacts of the nonuniform distribution of the network users. In [6], Wang et al. presented a population-based model by modifying the rank-based model [4]. ey introduced an e ective tool called anchor point to separate the followership dependency on users' geographical distribution. Furthermore, the anchor points can also connect the uncertain geographical distribution of the users and their followers. All the studies above focus on modeling the social relationship formation for online social networks with static users. However, those

models cannot apply to mobile social networks with mobile users because they do not consider the mobility of users. e geographical distribution of mobile users is usually necessary for modeling the social formation in mobile cases.

3 STATISTICAL FEATURES ON USERS' FOLLOWERSHIPS
Before proposing the users' followership formation model, we extract typical features of mobile social networks (MSNs) from the observations on two datasets of real-life MSNs, i.e., Gowalla and Brightkite [2]. Table 1 gives the description of datasets.
3.1 Degree Distribution of Followerships
We investigate the degree distributions of social relationships in Gowalla and Brightkite datasets, respectively.
We rst add up the number of users with a same outdegree, and then gather the statistics on the outdegree distribution. As shown in Figure 1, a long-tailed feature is captured for both datasets. More speci cally, the outdegree distributions for both datasets approximate to the Zipf's distribution. Furthermore, we nd there is no correlation between the degree distribution and local density of users according to the statistics. We remove the details due to limited space. Combining the observations above, we present the
rst statistical feature of MSNs.
Feature 1. e number of a user's followers approximately follows a Zipf's distribution.
3.2 Correlation between Users' Followership and Footprint
We investigate the spatial distribution of users' followers in Gowalla and Brightkite datasets. In existing works, e.g., [4, 6], a common approach was adopted to handle the mobility of users. It assumes that each mobile user is staying near a center, e.g., his mostly visited location. To the best of our knowledge, the rank-based model [4] is the most realistic theoretical model for social relationship formation. We include the results from [4, 6] as the second feature.
Feature 2 ([4, 6]). e probability that a user, say u, follows a particular user, say , is approximately inversely proportional to the power of the number of users whose most frequent check-in centers (MFCCs) are closer to the MFCC of than that of u.

Next, we investigate the social impacts of multiple homepoints (frequently visited points) of users. An MSN user usually has multiple centers, [1]. An interesting problem is whether there is some correlation between the visiting frequency at a center/homepoint (the number of visits on this position) and the social relationship formation. To address this issue, we check the correlation between the proportion of the followers that can be clustered to a certain center and the proportion of the check-in quantity belonging to this center. e statistic result shows that the follower proportion is positively relevant to the check-in proportion. Due to limited space, we remove these statistical gures. erefore, we summarize these results as the third feature.
Feature 3. For any user, the number of his followers belonging to a given center is positively relevant to the visiting frequency at this center; and the number of followers belonging to every center approximately follows a Zipf's distribution.

4 MODELING USERS' FOLLOWERSHIP FORMATION BASED ON FOOTPRINT

4.1 Geographical Distribution of Users'

In [1], Multi-center Gaussian Model was introduced to model the

users' spatial distribution in Gowalla and Brightkite [2].

For a given dataset, we can nd the centers of each user by a

greedy clustering algorithm [1] among the check-ins due to the

Pareto principle. We scan from the most visited points/positions

and combine all other visited check-in locations, whose distance

is less than a given threshold d, from the selected point, into a region. If the ratio of the total check-in number of this region to

the user's total check-in amount is greater than a threshold  , we

set these check-in positions as a region and determine its center. In

our experiment, we set  = 0.15 and d = 5 according to the training dataset so that most users could have several centers and users'

check-ins are grouped into their centers. Due to limited space, we

omit the detailed procedure. Please refer to Algorithm 1 in [1]. By

the chosen centers, we can estimate where the user k tends to be according to the probability distribution with the density function:

where the random variable X := (x, ) denotes the position of
a selected point in the deployment region, ck denotes the center location set of user k , ck,i denotes the location of the ith center of user k , Ik,i denotes the frequency of user k 's check-ins in center ck,i region, Ik denotes the total check-in frequency of user k , ck,i and k,i denote the mean and variance of the Gaussian Model of each center ck,i , |X - ck,i | represents the Euclidean distance between point/position X and center ck,i , and the coe cient k depends on ck and  , satisfying that:

4.2 Geographical Distribution of Followers
4.2.1 Zipf's Degree Distribution of Social Relations. By Feature 1, we let the number of followers of a particular node k  V,

Pr(qk = l ) =

From Eq. (3), we can observe that the degree distribution above

depends on the speci c network size, i.e., the number of users n.

note the neighborhood of a point u with radius r in the deployment

region O, i.e., the disk centered at u with radius r . Let N (u, r ) denote

the number of nodes contained in D(u, r ), i.e., the neighborhood

cardinality of u with radius r .

In this work, we introduce the anchor point to link a user's multi-

center distribution with his followers. For each node k , making each position in center list ck as the reference point, choose qk anchor points independently on the torus region O according to

the probability distribution with the density function:

Using this probability distribution, we can get the probability of

each user appearing at position pki , and sample a user m to be the association node with the anchor point, as the follower of user k .

5 EVALUATION OF MODELS
We evaluate the proposed model on Brightkite and Gowalla dataset. Since a user only has a few followers, it is hard to predict who is his follower and where the followers are among all users in the dataset. In particular, we are interested in the realistic signi cance of the model, i.e., given the location distribution of each user, we aim to generate followers for them and verify whether the statistical properties of these generated followers accord with the reality.
To demonstrate the advantages of NCBM, we also compare the simulation result on our model to those on the two baseline models.
5.1 Simulation Method
To evaluate our NCBM model, we generate the followers for each user in Gowalla and Brightkite according to the NCBM model.
In all of our simulations we only consider the users that have at least 10 check-ins so that we can model each user's spatial distribution with Multi-center Gaussian distribution accurately. We use the users' historical check-in data to model the geographical

distribution of Gowalla and Brightkite users. To calculate each equation above, we set the parameter  , ,  in advance. In the simulation process, we assign 0.7 to  , making most of the users having a small number of followers and some of them having many followers. Similarly, we assign 1 to , making that most followers of a user are close to the centers of this user. We let  = 1, which means that the in uence of a user's center is proportional to the sum of check-ins in this center area. e assigned parameters are close to the observed values obtained by the training dataset.
Based on the users' geographical distribution, we allocate the followers for each user in two datasets. A er selecting the centers of each user, we assign a number of followers to each user u according to Eq.(3). e user's degree l follows a Zipf's distribution depending on the number of users in each dataset. A er determining the degree l of each user u, we repeat choosing point pk on the map according to the probability calculated by Eq.(4). For each chosen point pk , we calculate the probability that each user appears at this position by Eq.(1), and choose a user u to be the user related to the point pk . e point pk is chosen as an anchor point of user u, and u is chosen as a follower of user u.

5.2 e Properties of Generated Network
Figure 2 shows the degree distribution generated by NCBM. is result actually conforms to the Feature 1 in Section 3.1. It demonstrates the e ectiveness of the designed degree formation method.
Figure 3 shows the simulation result on the geographical distribution of each user center's followership. We conclude that the simulation result on the geographical distribution of each user center's followership also follows a Zipf's distribution, which demonstrates that our social formation model extremely simulates the geographical distribution of realistic followership, validating Feature 2 mentioned in Section 3.2.

By the simulation results on the degree distribution and geographical distribution of followers, we prove the validity of NCBM.

5.3 e Comparison to the Baseline
We also simulate generating the followership by the other two baseline models, including distance-based model and rank-based model.
e simulation method is similar to the steps above. In distancebased model [3] and rank-based model [4], the probability that a user follows another user depending on the power of the distance between them and the number of people closer, respectively.
Figure 4 and 5 show the degree distribution and geographical distribution of followership generated by simulating the distancebased model. Figure 6 and 7 are the degree distribution and geographical distribution of followership generated by simulating the rank-based model. In Figure 4 and 6, X denotes the number of degree and Y denotes the the probability that users have the degree X . In Figure 5 and 7, X denotes the distance/rank between user u

and user and Y denotes the probability that user u follows user

when the distance/rank equals X . e degree distributions generated by the distance-based and rank-based models approximately

follow the Gaussian distribution, which has an obvious deviation

from Feature 1 in Section 3.1.

To evaluate the performance of the distance-based model, rank-

based model and NCBM on followership geographical distribution,

we use the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root-Mean-Square

Error (RMSE) to measure how the followership geographical distri-

bution t a Zipf's distribution. e smaller the MAE and RMSE are,

the be er the model performs. e results show that the follower-

ship geographical distribution generated by our NCBM performs

well among these three model.

6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We propose a neighborhood-cardinality-based model (NCBM) to emulate the social relationship formation mechanism from the perspective of users' geographical distribution. e model takes into account both the multiple hotspots property of spatial mobility and the long-tailed property of relationship degree distribution. e evaluation on real-life datasets from Brightkite and Gowalla shows that the proposed NCBM model can capture the features of MSNs be er than the classic distance-based model and rank-based model.
e NCBM can serve as a tool linking users' social-relationship networking and the spatial mobility pa ern and provide be er social recommendation in MSNs.
