ABSTRACT
Travel route planning aims to mine user's attributes and recommend personalized routes. How to build interest model for users and understand their real intention brings great challenges. This paper presents an approach which mines the user interest model by multi-source social media (e.g., travelogues and check-in records), and understands the user's real intention by active behavior such as point of interest (POI) inputs. In order to unify heterogeneous data from di erent sources, a topical package is built as the measurement space. Based on the topical package, user topical package is modeled to nd user interest and route topical package is constructed to describe the attributes of each route. User's active behavior can also be considered during route planning, where top ranked routes are nally recommended. The proposed multi-source topical package (MSTP) approach is evaluated on a real dataset and compared with two state-of-the-art methods. The result shows that MSTP performs better for providing personalized travel routes.

main issues for recommending personalized travel routes based on user's historical information from social media. Firstly, how to map the sematic information from social media to a uni ed space and measure the multi-source data with di erent formats. To this end, topical package model can be applied to get a measurement space. Secondly, how to model the user interest (especially, with the cold start problem) and understand user real intention. On the one hand, user's historical data can be mined to model the user interest. On the other hand, we can utilize the active behavior when a user seeks help from route planning. Thirdly, how to measure the similarity between user and route remains challenging. The topical package model provides an e ective way to address it.
In this work, we map travel trajectories obtained from social media (e.g., travelogues and check-in records) to a topical package space. For each topic and point of interest (POI), some representative tags are extracted from travelogues which re ect the interest of user and route. The consumption capability of user and the cost of each POI are important for travel planning, so the cost of each topic and POI is also trained from the travelogues. Moreover, the visiting season and duration of stay correspond to user preference, and we further mine them from the trajectories of check-in records. Based on this topical package, multi-source data can be mapped to a uni ed measurement space, so that matching user with route for personalized recommendation can be achieved.

Figure 1 shows the framework of our approach, which contains o ine modules and online modules. We build measurement topical package, user topical package and route topical package rstly, followed by trave route planning. The o ine modules aim at constructing topical package space, mining POIs and popular routes, and corresponding routes topical package models. The online modules aim at modeling user topical package and recommending popular routes. First, the topical package measurement space is mined o ine from social media combining travelogues and check-in records. Representative tags, average consumer expenditure, the distribution of visiting season and the distribution of duration of stay are obtained in this step. Based on this topical package measurement space, the route topical package are mined. Since a route is formed by a sequence of POIs, the second step is mapping social media data related to the POIs on the route to the topical package space. During online planning, the user topical package is obtained from the user's historical travelogues and check-in records. In travel route planning module, the similarity of user and route can be measured in the topical package measurement space, so that candidate routes will be ranked. Then, top ranked routes are further optimized by users' active behaviors as the nal results.
In summary, the main contributions of our work are: · We utilize multi-source social media data mapped to a unied measurement space for personalized travel route planning. · Our approach not only models user interest by historical data but also understands real intention by active behavior. Four factors including user interest, consumption capability, visiting season and preferred time are considered. · Experiment on a real dataset shows that compared with famous route planning (FAM) and topical package model (TPM) [4], our approach performs better for nding interest, understanding real intention, and route planning.
2 RELATED WORK
In previous studies, four types of social media data have been mainly investigated for constructing popular routes in travel recommendation, including GPS trajectories [8], check-in records [6, 7], travelogues [1] and geo-tagged photos [2].
Spatial information (location) is fundamental for POI mining. Location-based collaborative ltering (LCF) is the most famous method. In LCF, the location co-occurrence of previously visited POIs is used to measure the similarity of social users. Text description can contribute to the user interest modeling and route attribute mining. Particularly, multi-source data can form a complementary solution for data sparsity and cold start problem. Famous route planning is commonly used in recommending the most famous routes, but no personalization is taken into consideration. Topical package model can map di erent data into a space to measure the similarity, and it is used in our approach. Among topical package model based works, Jiang et al. [4] also use multi-source big social media to build topical package for user and route. However, di erent from our work, neither duration of stay nor user active input has been taken into consideration. Yu et al. [6] propose a personalized travel package method with multi-point-ofinterest recommendation. However, they use only location data,

and only return a set of POIs rather than an ordered sequence. Liu et al. [5] propose a personalized travel package recommendations. However, the travel package candidates are not collected with real time, which results in the information used is static and might be out of date.
3 MULTI-SOURCE TOPICAL PACKAGE
We provide personalized travel routes based on user's travel attributes mined from travel records, which include travel interest, consumption capacity, visiting season and duration of stay. In this way, not the most famous routes but the routes meeting user's travel attributes as much as possible can be recommended. In order to measure the attributes of user and route, a topical package measurement space is constructed by multi-source data, and based on this space, user topical package and route topical package are built.
3.1 Topical Package Measurement Space
Topical package measurement space is a kind of space to bridge the gap between the attributes of user and route. We use travelogues and check-in records as training data for its construction. Four factors of each topic are considered: (1) representative tags are mined from travelogues for each topic and POI to describe the travel interest, (2) average consumer expenditure of the POIs and topics is also mined from travelogues, (3) the distribution of visiting season is mined from check-in records, (4) the distribution of duration of stay is also mined from check-in records.
In our work, we downloaded travelogues of POIs on nine most famous cities of the world from IgoUgo.com. The topic category de nition and POIs are available and can be used directly. In our opinions, representative tags are not only of high frequency but also can distinguish a topic from others. After removing the meaningless symbols and stop words such as "in" and "my", term frequencyinverse document frequency (TF-IDF) is leveraged to get the representative tags and corresponding scores. For the i-th topic, a set of tags i and corresponding tag scores ij are obtained.
The cost matrix for all topics is de ned as (M) which is an N 4 matrix (N is the number of topics, and 4 is the cost rank). In order to evaluate the cost of each topic, we focus on the sentences containing numbers and symbols such as "$" or "e". After selecting these sentences, natural language processing (NLP) is used to process each of them for selecting sentences related to cost. First, a tool1 is used to learn feature of each sentence. Then, text classi er is trained with positive samples and negative samples to get the cost. In this step, sentences which contain numbers and relate to cost are de ned as positive samples. On the contrary, sentences which contain numbers but are not related to cost are de ned as negative samples. Finally, the average cost is used to represent the cost for each topic. We divide the cost to four rates: (1) less than $10, (2) from $10 to $30, (3) from $30 to $50, (4) more than $50. If the average cost belongs to a rate, its value is 1. For example, if the cost of a topic is $25, the corresponding cost vector in (M) is [0, 1, 0, 0]. At the same time, the cost matrix of POI (P) is also obtained.

Before mining the topic's visiting season, we leverage the checkin records to get POIs and match them with the POIs in travelogues. First, a set of meaningless check-in records should be ltered for each city. We match check-in content with city name (e.g., Los Angeles), to divide the check-in record sets. The geo-location restriction is further used for re nement. Then, the timestamp of checkin records is used to evaluate the visiting season. For example, if the timestamp of a check-in record is "2012-03-12, 13:32:46", the corresponding season is spring. The season matrices of POI and topic are de ned as  (P) and  (M). The corresponding season vector in  (P) or  (M) is de ned as [spring, summer, autumn, winter], with a normalization applied.
As for the duration of stay, the interval in check-in records between POIs is used. We also split the duration of stay to four rates as [less than 2h, 2h-4h, 4h-6h, beyond 6h]. The average duration of stay of POIs describes the duration of stay of the topic. Therefore, the durations of stay of POI  (P) and topic  (M) are obtained.

3.2 Modeling User Topical Package

Next, we introduce the user topical package, which includes user

topic interest distribution (U ), user consumption capability (U ), user travel time distribution  (U ), and user preferred duration of

stay  (U ).

Based on the user's historical travelogues and check-in records,

we extract the tags in topical package, whose frequency can re-

ect the user's interest. If a user's tag appearers frequently in one

topic and less in others, it suggests a higher interest towards the

topic. The tag distribution of all topics is represented as (U ) =

[1(U

)
,

...,

k(U

)
,

...,

 N(U

)

].

k(U )

is

the

ratio

between

the

number

of

tags belonging to the k-th topic and the number of tags of the cor-

responding user, which is also normalized as:

k(U ) =

k(U )

n i =1

i(U

)

(1)

where k(U ) value of k(U

represents the count ) is obtained as:

of

user'

tags

towards

topic

k

.

The

nU

k(U ) =

ik

(2)

i =1

where nU is the number of tags of user U and ik is the corresponding score of the i-th tag for the k-th topic. The frequency of tags
can re ect the user's interest. In this way, the user topical interest
distribution is obtained. To overcome data sparsity, the user consumption capability (U ),
user travel time distribution  (U ) and user preferred duration of stay  (U ) will be obtained with the assist of user topic interest distribution (U ) and topical package. The method to get (U ) is:

 (U ) =  (U ) ·  (M)

(3)

where (U ) is an N  1 matrix. The cost distribution of all the topics and distribution of user's topic interests are used to represent user's consumption capability.

As for  (U ) and  (U ), the similar method to (U ) is applied to

(U ) and topical package. Thus, we get user topical package model

3.3 Mining Route Topical Package

The route topical package mining is processed o ine. Since a route

is formed by a sequence of POIs, the route topical package is based

on the POIs' packages. The average value of all the POIs on the

route is used to get route topical package model for a route. Why

we select the distribution of POIs to a route is that a POI may ap-

pear in multiple topics. Therefore, a POI should not be classi ed

to a certain topic, but topic distribution can represent the di erent

degree of the POI towards each topic.

The POI cost distribution (P), POI visiting season distribution

 (P) and POI duration of stay  (P) have been obtained in Section 3.1.

As for route interest distribution , we map POIs of the route to

the topical package space to represent the POIs' topic interest dis-

tribution as

(P )

=

[1(P ),

...,

k(P

)
,

...,

N(P )]. k(P )

is

the

ratio

between

the number of tags belonging to the k-th topic and the number of

tags of the corresponding POI, which is also normalized as:

k(P ) =

k(P )

n i =1

i(P

)

(4)

where k(P ) value of k(P

represents the count ) is obtained as:

of

POI's

tags

towards

topic

k

.

The

k(P ) = nP ik

(5)

i =1

where

n

 P

is

the

number

of

tags

of

POI

P

and

ik

is

the

correspond-

ing score of the i-th tag for the k-th topic.

As for (P), the method is as follow:

(P) = (P) ·  (M)

(6)

 (P ) and  (P ) can be obtained in the same way.

where n1 denotes the number of POIs for route R. (R),  (R) and  (R) can be obtained in the same way.

4 TRAVE ROUTE PLANNING
After obtaining the user topical package and route topical package, we introduce the method of travel route planning. If a users inputs some interested POIs, it is accepted that these POIs are important. Thus, we rstly retrieve a set routes R = {r1, ..., rn } which contain the necessary POIs as the candidate routes. If the user does not actively input the interested POIs, a set of most popular routes R = {r1, ..., rn } will be obtained and ranked as the candidate routes. Based on the candidate routes, the similarity of each attribute among travel interest, cost, season and duration of stay

between useri and routej will be computed. The similarity of travel

is

measured

as:

((i,

) j)

=

)

·

(8)

The similarity of travel cost ((i,)j), travel time ((i,)j) and travel du-
ration of stay ((i,)j) can be obtained in the same way. Then, the global similarity between useri and routej is:

(i, j)

= w



((i,

) j)

+

w



 ((i,)j)

+ w

 ((i,)j) + w





( ) (i, j

)

(9)

where w , w  , w and w are weights of the topic interest, cost,

visiting season and duration of stay. The constraint condition is:

w + w + w + w = 1

(10)

Finally, the top-r routes with maximum weight (i, j) will be recommended to useri as the nal routes.

5 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
5.1 Dataset
Our experiment is conduced on a dataset from IgoUgo.com which consists of travelogues and check-in records. For travelogues, the number is 24,008 and the number of travel POIs in nine famous cities is 864 [3]. There are 2,892 users, 307 POIs and 150,101 checkin records after removing missing data.

5.2 Methodology

We compare our multi-source topical package (MSTP) approach with two state-of-the-art methods for travel route planning:
· Famous route planning (FAM). This method recommends the most famous routes, without personalization. Compared with shortest path or fastest path based routes planning, FAM is data driven and it takes the collective intelligence into consideration.
· Topical package model (TPM) [4]. This method mines the user's interest and route's attributes as well. However, it does not consider the duration of stay, and has not incorporated the user active behavior to understand real intention.
We use the average precision with top-r routes (AP@r ) as the performance metric.

5.3 Result
Figure 2 shows the comparison of FAM, MSTP and TPM. Due to page limit only the performance when w , w  , w and w in Equation 9 are 0.5, 0.2, 0.2 and 0.1 respectively is reported here and this set of parameters selection is relatively optimal. On the one hand, with r in AP@r increasing, the performances of MSPT and TPM decrease. That is to say, TPM and MSTP are good at nding user interest in the top ranked routes. On the other hand, we can see that FAM performs poor with any r compared with TPM and MSTP. FAM only selects the most popular routes, with collective

intelligence but no personalization. Topical package based methods (TPM and MSTP) perform much better, showing their advantages in nding user interest and preference. The reason is that they both leverage social media data to mine user attribute and route attribute. However, for TPM, no active behavior to understand real intention is its critical defect. Our proposed MSTP outperforms TPM. The duration of stay is considered as a factor to mine the topical package, which is useful to help nd the user interested routes, and the user's active behavior (POI inputs) can assist to understand the real intention to remove some routes (which are famous, but less likely to meet user's interest).
Conclusion: Based on above discussion, the proposed MSTP utilizing multi-source social media data to construct topical package achieves better performance in modeling user interest, understanding real intention and travel planning.
