1 INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, entities (such as people, organizations, or products) have become rst-class citizens in web search, as well as in other domains. Entities are natural units for organizing information and a key enabling component for semantic search. Semantic search is not a single method, but rather an umbrella term that encompasses various techniques that aim to understand queries and answer them in a meaningful way. Building blocks of semantic search include, among others, entity retrieval [9, 16, 27, 32], entity linking [5, 7, 15, 19], query understanding [10, 14], and result presentation [6, 18].
ere are two main reasons that motivated us to develop this toolkit. First, there exist a range of tools and demonstrators that address one speci c task. Examples include GERBIL [30], TAGME [11], STICS [21], and Broccoli [4]. Second, repeatability and reproducibility of results is a fundamental requirement of scienti c

progress [1, 17, 23]. Having an open source and veri able implementation of methods can foster research and development. In the area of entity-oriented search, despite recent advances, there is a lack of publicly available implementations of standard methods and techniques. With this work, we aim to ll that gap.
In this paper, we present Nordlys, which is a toolkit for entityoriented and semantic search. One of its distinguishing features is that it implements a number of traditional and state-of-the-art methods for a range of tasks: entity retrieval, entity linking in queries, identifying target types of queries, and entity cataloging. Another important characteristic is that it accommodates various usage needs on di erent levels:
· It is made available as an open source Python library that can be integrated into larger applications or can be used as a command line tool for research and experimentation. e code is organized in a three-tier architecture, cleanly separating the various layers of functionality.
· It provides a RESTful API, through which Nordlys can be used as a service, much like a black box.
· e functionality is also available through a graphical web user interface. is interface can be used, e.g., to perform user studies on result presentation (similar to [6]).
In summary, Nordlys represents a major step towards reproducible and extensible semantic search research. It is meant to be a continuous e ort, with additional methods included over time, as opposed to a one-time release of code. e toolkit is available at h p://nordlys.cc.
2 FUNCTIONALITY
In this section we detail the functionality that is implemented in the Nordlys toolkit.
2.1 Entity Catalog
e main enabling component of semantic search, from a data perspective, is a knowledge base, which contains a collection of entities, their a ributes, and relations to other entities. It also contains information about entity types, which are o en organized in a hierarchical structure (called type taxonomy). e entity catalog serves as a data access layer to the knowledge base. It is used to obtain information about entities, such as their IDs, names, a ributes, and relationships. Additionally, it provides basic statistics about entities and properties; these statistics may be utilized, among others, for result presentation (e.g., identifying prominent properties when generating entity cards) [20]. e entity catalog may be seen as

a data abstraction layer that makes the higher-level functionality largely independent of the particular data source. Nordlys is shipped with code and support for the DBpedia knowledge base, but data may be loaded into the entity catalog from any other knowledge base. Speci cally, the entity catalog o ers the following functionality:
· Entity lookup. Presents all entity properties from the knowledge base in the form of key-value pairs.
· ID mapping. Provides a one-to-one mapping of entity IDs across various knowledge bases via same-as links (DBpedia and Freebase).
· Surface form lookup. Presents all entities that match a given surface form ("alias"). A large surface form dictionary is obtained from the FACC collection, which contains Freebase annotations for the ClueWeb09 and ClueWeb12 datasets [12].
· Basic statistics. A set of statistics are computed over contents of the knowledge base, including RDF types, predicates, and properties.

2.2 Entity Retrieval
Entity retrieval is a core building block of semantic search, where a ranked list of entities are presented in response to an entity-bearing query. Formally, it is de ned as follows.

D

1 (E

): Given a query q, entity re-

trieval is the task of returning a ranked list of entities (e1, ...,ek ) from an underlaying knowledge base KB, ordered according to their

relevance to the query q.

e toolkit implements both standard baselines and more recent approaches:
· Elastic. e BM25 model, as implemented in Elasticsearch, which is the most e cient retrieval model of our toolkit.
· LM. Language Modeling [29] approach (with Dirichlet prior and Jelinek-Mercer smoothing), which employs a single eld representation of entities.
· MLM. e Mixture of Language Models [28], which represents entities as structured ( elded) documents, using a linear

combination of language models built for each eld. For DBpedia, we use a ve- eld representation [20]. · PRMS. e Probabilistic Model for Semistructured Data [22], which uses collection statistics to compute eld weights in for MLM model (thereby making in parameter-free). · ELR. e Entity Linking incorporated Retrieval model [16] is a state-of-the-art approach, which extends text-based retrieval models by considering entities mentioned in the query.
e online repository includes retrieval performance measurements on the DBpedia-entity test collection [3, 20], which is a standard benchmark for entity retrieval.

2.3 Entity Linking in eries
Identifying named entities in queries and linking them to the corresponding entry in the knowledge base is known as the task of entity linking in queries (ELQ) [15]. Various demonstrations have been released for general purpose entity linking [8, 11, 26, 26, 30].
e most popular among them is TAGME [11], which has been designed for short texts such as tweets, search snippets. TAGME, however, does not handle the ambiguity of search queries and an entity mention is only linked to a single entity. e entity linking functionality in Nordlys aims to bridge this gap, by implementing both baselines and state-of-the-art approaches for entity linking in queries. e task is formally de ned as follows.

D

2 (E

): Given a query q,

entity linking in queries returns one or multiple interpretations of the

query, A1, ...,An . Each interpretation consists of a set of entity linking decisions, i.e., mention-entity pairs: Ai = {(m1,e1), ..., (mk ,ek )}, where mention mj is a query substring that refers to entity ej in the

knowledge base.

e following methods are implemented in Nordlys:
· CMNS. e baseline method that performs entity linking based on the overall popularity of entities as link targets, i.e., the commonness feature [24]. is method has been introduced in [25], and has been widely used in later research, e.g., [5, 15, 31].

Figure 2: e Nordlys web user interface.

· MLM-greedy. An e cient generative retrieval model proposed in [15], that combines the commonness score with the textual similarity between the query and the entity [28].
· LTR-greedy. e recommended method (with respect to both e ciency and e ectiveness) by Hasibi et al. [19], which employs a learning-to-rank model with various textual and semantic similarity features.

2.4 Target Type Identi cation
Target type detection is one speci c form of query understanding, where the aim is to assign target types (or categories) to queries from some type taxonomy [2, 13]. Formally:

D

3 (T

TI

): Given a query

q, the aim of target type identi cation task is to return a ranked list

of entity types (t1, ...,tk ), ordered with respect to their likelihood of being the target type of query q.

We implement three diiferent approaches from the literature [2, 13]:
· Entity-centric is method rst ranks entities based on their relevance to the query, then looks at what types the top-k ranked entities have. e nal score for a given type t is the aggregation of the relevance scores of entities with that type [2].
· Type-centric is approach builds, for each type, a direct term-based representation (pseudo type description document), by aggregating descriptions of entities of that type. en, those type representations can be ranked much like documents [2].
· Learning-to-rank A supervised learning approach, which considers a rich set of features such as distributional similarity, type label similarities, and taxonomy-driven features [13].
ese methods has been evaluated using a publicly available test collection; the test collection and results are presented in [13].

3 THE NORDLYS TOOLKIT
In this section, we present the overall architecture and the various ways in which our toolkit may be used. We ship our code with a small sample taken from DBpedia, and include scripts for processing and indexing DBpedia and Freebase. We also make data-dumps available for download (entity catalog and search indices).
3.1 Architecture
Nordlys is based on a multitier architecture with three layers: core (data tier), logic, and services (presentation tier); see Figure 1.
Core. e core layer provides basic functionality, including retrieval (Elasticsearch), storage (MongoDB key-value store), machine learning (scikit-learn), and evaluation (trec eval). In parentheses are the third-party tools we currently use. It is possible to connect additional external tools (or replace our default choices) by implementing standard interfaces of the respective core modules. Additionally, a separate data module is provided with functionality for loading and preprocessing standard data sets (DBpedia, Freebase, ClueWeb, etc.). e core layer represents a versatile general-purpose modern IR library, which may also be accessed using command line tools.
Logic. is layer contains the main "business logic," which is organized around ve main modules: (1) entity provides access to the entity catalog (including knowledge bases and entity surface form dictionaries); (2) query provides the representation of search queries along with various preprocessing methods; (3) features is a collection of entity-related features, which may be used across di erent search tasks; (4) entity retrieval (ER) contains various entity ranking methods, cf. §2.2; (5) entity linking (EL) implements entity linking functionality, cf. §2.3. e logic layer may not be accessed directly.

Services. e services layer provides end-user access to the toolkit's functionality, through the command line, RESTful API, and web interface. Four main services are available: entity retrieval (ER), entity linking (EL), target type identi cation (TTI), and entity catalog (EC); these we have already explained in §2.
3.2 Usage Modes
Nordlys may be used as a Python library, RESTful API, command line tool, or a web interface.
Python Library. We base our toolkit on Python 3.5+, speci cally, on the Anaconda distribution. e code is complemented with an automatically generated documentation as well as an extensive how-to. Upon downloading our toolkit, installing the prerequisites, and loading the necessary data, it should be possible to run Nordlys on any machine.
Command line. e main functionality may be accessed through a set of command line tools. is can be useful, e.g., for processing larger amounts of data and eliminating the network overhead.
RESTful API. We provide a public API endpoint (subject to registering for an API key). Figure 3 shows an excerpt from the response received from the API for an entity retrieval request. For convenience, the parameters of the methods are set to reasonable defaults; these values may be changed when calling the services.
Web Interface. Figure 2 shows an excerpt from our web user interface. e implementation is based on Flask and Bootstrap. e default se ings of the web interface are similar to that of the API endpoint, any may be changed on the interface.
4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We have introduced Nordlys, a toolkit that implements a range of methods for entity-oriented and semantic search. It is available as a Python library, as a command line tool, a RESTful API, and as a graphical web user interface. Nordlys is meant to be a continuous e ort; we plan to include additional methods, e.g., entity summarization. We are also working on optimizations, to improve the e ciency of our methods.
