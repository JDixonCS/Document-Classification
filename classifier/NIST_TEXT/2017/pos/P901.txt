ABSTRACT
Understanding the factors comprising IR system e ectiveness is of primary importance to compare di erent IR systems. E ectiveness is traditionally broken down, using ANOVA, into a topic and a system e ect but this leaves out a key component of our evaluation paradigm: the collections of documents. We break down e ectiveness into topic, system and sub-corpus e ects and compare it to the traditional break down, considering what happens when di erent evaluation measures come into play. We found that sub-corpora are a signi cant e ect. e consideration of which allows us to be more accurate in estimating what systems are signi cantly di erent. We also found that the sub-corpora a ect di erent evaluation measures in di erent ways and this may impact on what systems are considered signi cantly di erent.

1 INTRODUCTION
Studying the e ectiveness of Information Retrieval (IR) systems is a core area of investigation, the main goal of which is to compare di erent IR systems in a robust and repeatable way. Commonly, IR system e ectiveness is broken down as
e ectiveness score = topic e ect + system e ect
e topic e ect was shown to be greater than the system e ect using a two-way ANOVA to decompose e ectiveness as above [1, 14].
e decomposition allowed simultaneous multiple comparisons of IR systems on TREC data, determining which were signi cantly be er than others.
To improve the estimation of the system e ect, you need to add components to the above model. For example, [10] showed that a topic*system interaction improved the estimation but the reported experiments relied on simulated data. Using a Grid of Points (GoP) approach (i.e. IR systems originated by a factorial combination of

their components) the system e ect can be sub-divided into system components in order to be er understand system behavior [3].
However, at least one "ingredient" is missing from consideration: the collections of documents that are an integral part of the evaluation paradigm. Past work studied how sub-corpora impact IR e ectiveness [13] and how collection size and the choice of documents in uenced the way that a test collection ranked one retrieval system relative to another [7]. Both these studies highlighted the importance of sub-corpora to system performance but they did not incorporate the sub-corpus e ect into a wider model:
e ectiveness score = topic e ect + system e ect + sub-corpus e ect
By integrating topic, system, and sub-corpus e ects into the one model, comparisons can be made between the magnitude of the e ects and, potentially, signi cant di erences between systems can be more accurately calculated.
is paper addresses two research questions:
RQ1 what is the impact of considering sub-corpora in an e ectiveness model?
RQ2 how do di erent evaluation measures behave with respect to e ectiveness models including sub-corpus e ects?
e methodology is described next (Sec. 2) followed by experiments and ndings (Sec. 3), before nally concluding (Sec. 4).

2 METHODOLOGY
A General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) [11] explains the variation of a dependent variable ("Data") in terms of a controlled variation
of independent variables ("Model") in addition to a residual uncon-
trolled variation ("Error"): Data = Model + Error. In GLMM terms, ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) a empts to explain data (dependent variable scores) in terms of the experimental conditions (the model)
and an error component. Typically, ANOVA is used to determine
under which condition dependent variables di er and what propor-
tion of variation can be a ributed to di erences between speci c
conditions, as de ned by the independent variable(s).
e experimental design determines how to compute the model and estimate its parameters. It is possible to have an independent measures design where di erent subjects participate in di erent experimental conditions (factors) or a repeated measures design, where each subject participates in all experimental conditions (factors). A
nal distinction is between crossed/factorial designs ­ where every level of one factor is measured in combination with every level of the other factors ­ and nested designs, where levels of a factor are grouped within each level of another nesting factor.
e traditional crossed repeated measures two-way ANOVA
design, used in past work [1, 14], breaks down e ectiveness into a
topic and a system e ect:

where Yij is the e ectiveness score (from an evaluation measure) of the i-th subject in the j-th factor; µ ·· is the grand mean; i = µi · -µ ·· is the e ect of the i-th subject, i.e. a topic, where µi · is the mean of the i-th subject; j = µ ·j - µ ·· is the e ect of the j-th factor, i.e. a system, where µ ·j is the mean of the j-th factor; nally, ij is the error commi ed by the model in predicting the e ectiveness score of the i-th subject in the factor j. Examining eq (1) on both a whole
and split collection (i.e. sub-corpora) we can understand changes
to e ectiveness between these two collection conditions.
We also explore a crossed repeated measures three-way ANOVA
design, which breaks down e ectiveness into a topic, system, and
sub-corpus e ect, as shown in Figure 1:

Yi jk = µ ··· + i + j + k + ( )jk + i jk

(2)

where: Yijk is the e ectiveness score of the i-th subject in the j-th and k-th factors; µ ··· is the grand mean; i = µi ·· - µ ··· is the e ect of the i-th subject, i.e. a topic, where µi ·· is the mean of the i-th subject; j = µ ·j · - µ ··· is the e ect of the j-th factor, i.e. a system, where µ ·j · is the mean of the j-th factor; k = µ ··k - µ ··· is the e ect of the k-th factor, i.e. a sub-corpus, where µ ··k is the mean of the k-th factor; ( )jk is the interaction between systems and sub-corpora; nally, ijk is the error commi ed by the model in predicting the e ectiveness score of the i-th subject in the two
factors j and k.
We compare the GLMM models in eqs (1) and (2). Note, when we
apply eq (1) to sub-corpora, we use the design shown in Figure 1 but
omit the k sub-corpus e ect. us, we obtain a two-way ANOVA where we have more replicates for each (topic, system) pair, one
for each sub-corpus. An ANOVA test outcome indicates, for each factor, the Sum of
Squares (SS), the Degrees of Freedom (DF), the Mean Squares (MS), the
F statistics, and the p-value of that factor, to determine signi cance.
We are also interested in determining the proportion of variance that is due to a particular factor: i.e. we estimate its e ect-size measure or Strength of Association (SOA), which is a "standardized index and estimates a parameter that is independent of sample size and quanti es the magnitude of the di erence between populations or the relationship between explanatory and response variables" [9].

In experimentation, a Type I error occurs if a true null hypothesis

is rejected. e probability of such an error is . e chances of

making a Type I error for a series of comparisons is greater than the

error rate for a single comparison. If we consider C comparisons, the probability of at least one Type I error is 1-(1-)C , which increases

with the number of comparisons. Type I errors are controlled by

applying the Tukey Honestly Signi cant Di erence (HSD) test [5]

with a signi cance level  = 0.05. Tukey's method is used in

ANOVA to create con dence intervals for all pairwise di erences

between factor levels, while controlling the family error rate. Two

3 EXPERIMENTS
We used the TREC Adhoc T07 and T08 collections: 528,155 documents made up of four TIPSTER sub-corpora: Foreign Broadcast Information Service (TIPFBIS, 130,471 documents); Federal Register (TIPFR, 55,630 documents); Financial Times (TIPFT, 210,158 documents); and Los Angeles Times (TIPLA, 131,896 documents). T07 and T08 provide 50 topics: 351-400 and 401-450, as well as
binary relevance judgments drawn from a pool depth of 100; 103 and 129 runs were submi ed to T07 and T08, respectively.
We split the T07 and T08 runs on the four sub-corpora by keeping
the retrieved documents that belong to each sub-corpus. We applied
the same split procedure to relevance judgments. is caused some
topics to have no relevant documents on some sub-corpora, which
suggests some kind of bias during topic creation and/or relevance
assessment. Consequently, we kept only the topics that have at
least one relevant document on each sub-corpus. is le us with 22 topics for T07 and 15 topics for T08. We used eight evaluation measures: Average Precision (AP), P@10; Rprec, Rank-Biased Precision (RBP) [8], Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain (nDCG) [6], nDCG@20, Expected Reciprocal Rank (ERR) [2], and Twist [4].

3.2 RQ2 ­ Sub-corpora & evaluation measures
Table 1 shows eq (2) applied to the four sub-corpora for T07 and T08 for all evaluation measures. e topic e ect is signi cant and large in all cases while the system e ect is a signi cant medium size e ect in about half of the cases and large in the other half.
e sub-corpora are always a signi cant e ect with small or medium size, except for RBP and ERR on T08 for which it is a large size. On T07, the sub-corpus e ect is always smaller than the system e ect, on T08 the sub-corpus e ect is bigger than the system e ect for P@10, RBP, and ERR. e sub-corpus*system interaction e ect is generally not signi cant, with the exception of nDCG and nDCG@20 on T07 and nDCG and ERR on T08 for which it is signi cant though small.
Table 1 shows the Kendall's  correlations between the rankings of systems using eq (1) on the whole TIPSTER collection and eq (2) on the four sub-corpora. e rankings are generally correlated, indicating a good agreement between the two approaches, even if there are some cases where correlation drops, namely P@10, nDCG@20, and ERR, on T08 and nDCG@20 on T07.
4 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We nd that sub-corpora are a signi cant e ect on system e ectiveness. While past work has indicated such an e ect exists, to the best of our knowledge, this is the rst time such an e ect has been integrated into a e ectiveness model and e ect sizes compared to other known factors. We nd that di erent evaluation measures are affected in di erent ways by sub-corpora, which may impact on what systems are considered signi cantly di erent to each other. We found that ranking systems using sub-corpora reasonably agrees with ranking systems with respect to a whole collection but using the information about sub-corpora allows a more accurate estimation of which systems are signi cantly di erent.
is is initial work. We recognize that the number of topics in our collections is small. We next plan to understand the impact of di erent kinds of sub-corpora. We also plan to extend the present methodology to study the impact of di erent collections on system performance rather than sub-corpora within one collection.
