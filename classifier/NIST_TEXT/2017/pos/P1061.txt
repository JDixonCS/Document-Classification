ABSTRACT
Sentence ordering (SO) is a key component of verbal ability. It is also crucial for automatic text generation. While numerous researchers developed various methods to automatically evaluate the informativeness of the produced contents, the evaluation of readability is usually performed manually. In contrast to that, we present a selfsu cient metric for SO assessment based on text topic-comment structure. We show that this metric has high accuracy.
KEYWORDS
Information retrieval, evaluation, text coherence, sentence ordering, topic, comment, information structure, topic-comment structure
1 INTRODUCTION
Sentence order (SO) has a strong in uence on text perception and understanding [1]. Let consider the following example:
Example 1.1. e Nibelung is the dwarf Alberich, and the ring in question is the one he fashions from the Rhine Gold. Wagner's opera title Der Ring des Nibelungen is most literally rendered in English as e Ring of the Nibelung.
e text is hardly comprehensible. When we are reading the Nibelung or the ring in question, we are asking ourselves what's it all about? which Nibelung? what question? even if in the next sentence it becomes clearer. Let us now reverse the two sentences:
Example 1.2. Wagner's opera title Der Ring des Nibelungen is most literally rendered in English as e Ring of the Nibelung. e Nibelung is the dwarf Alberich, and the ring in question is the one he fashions from the Rhine Gold.
Now, it is clear that the Nibelung and the ring in question explain the opera title e Ring of the Nibelung. ese examples illustrate that appropriate SO is crucial for readability. Automatic text generation, particularly multi-document extractive summarization, systems also face SO problem [3, 4]. We distinguish two tasks related to SO: (1) to produce the best order for a given set

of sentences and (2) to measure the order quality, i.e. determining how well a given list of sentences is ordered. In this paper, we focus on the la er task. In order to measure the quality of SO, if a gold standard is available, then correlation between the ground truth SO and the system order (e.g. Kendall or Spearman rank correlation coe cients) can be used [19]. e requirement of a gold standard containing the correct SO limits the usage of such methods. Indeed, gold standard is o en not available or not obvious to build manually. In contrast, in this paper we propose a self-su cient metric for text coherence assessment that does not require additional data. We evaluate the quality of the metric using the framework proposed in [12]. To evaluate the text coherence, we use a linguistic approach based on the topic-comment structure of the text and inter-sentence similarity.
A clause-level topic is the phrase in a clause that the rest of the
clause is understood to be about, and the comment is what is being
said about the topic. According to [24], the topic does not provide new information
but connects the sentence to the context. us, the topic and the comment are opposed in terms of the given/new information. e contraposition of the given/new information is called information structure or topic-comment structure. Going back to Example 1.1, the Nibelung and the ring in question from the rst sentence are expected to be already known by the reader, i.e. they represent topics. However, only the next sentence provides the necessary information. In contrast, in Example 1.2 the rst mention of the ring and the Nibelung was given at the end of the rst sentence ( e Ring of the Nibelung) and then is detailed in the second sentence. In the rst sentence, Wagner's opera title Der Ring des Nibelungen incarnates the topic and is most literally rendered in English as e Ring of the Nibelung corresponds to the comment. In the second sentence, e Nibelung and the ring in question refers to topic, while the comment parts are presented by is the dwarf Alberich and is the one he fashions from the Rhine Gold.
Although, in literature topic-comment structure has been exploited for document re-ranking [13], classi cation [5], and text summarization [11], to our knowledge, it has never been applied for SO. e contribution of this paper is a completely automatic approach for SO evaluation based on topic-comment structure of a text that requires only shallow parsing and has linear complexity. Our metric considers the pairwise term similarities of the topics and the comments of the adjacent sentences in a text since word repetition is one of the formal signs of text coherence [1].

2 STATE OF THE ART
Current methods to evaluate readability are based on the familiarity of terms and syntax complexity [8]. Word complexity may be estimated by humans [7, 14, 29] or according to its length [30]. Researches also propose to use language models [8, 27]. Usually assessors assign a score to the readability of a text in some range [1]. Syntactical errors, unresolved anaphora, redundant information and coherence in uence readability and therefore the score may depend on the number of these mistakes [26]. BLEU and edit distance may be applied for relevance judgment as well as for readability evaluation. ese metrics are semi-automatic because they require a gold standard. Another set of methods is based on syntax analysis which may be combined with statistics (e.g. sentence length, depth of a parse tree, omission of personal verbs, rate of prepositional phrases, noun and verb groups) [6, 25, 32, 33], but they remain suitable only for the readability evaluation of a particular sentence and, therefore, cannot be used for assessing extracts. Lapata applies the greedy algorithm maximizing the total probability on a text corpus as well as using a speci c ordering to verb tenses [18]. Louis and Nenkova use a hidden Markov model in which the coherence between adjacent sentences is viewed as transition rules between di erent topics [23]. Barzilay and Lapata introduce an entity grid model where sentences are mapped into discourse entities with their grammatical roles [2]. Entity features are used to compute the probability of transitions between adjacent sentences. en machine learning classi ers are applied. Elsner and Charniak add co-reference features [10]. Lin et al. ameliorate the model by discourse relations [21]. e entity grid model and its extensions require syntactical parsing. e disadvantages of these models are data sparsity, domain dependence and computational complexity.
e closest work to ours is [12] that proposes an automatic approach for SO assessment where the similarity between adjacent sentences is used as a measure of text coherence. However, it assigns equal scores to initial and inverse SO due to the symmetric similarity measure. In contrast, our topic-comment based method assigns higher score to the text in Example 1.2 than 1.1.
3 TOPIC-COMMENT STRUCTURE FOR SO
Although it is not the core element of our method, in order to be er understand the topic-comment structure of texts of di erent genres, we manually examined 10 documents randomly chosen from three datasets (30 texts in total): (1) Wikipedia; (2) TREC Robust1; (3) TREC WT10G (for collection details see Section 4). We looked at topic-topic (TT), comment-topic (CT), topic-comment (TC) and comment-comment (CC) inter-sentence relations in the texts, i.e. how frequently a topic (or a comment) of a clause became a topic (or a comment) in posterior clauses. We found that for all collections, the most frequent relation is TT, then follows CT. TT+CT compose more than 65% of the relationships that we found, whatever the collection is; it is more than 80% for Wikipedia. CC is more rare and TC is the most uncommon relation, especially in Wikipedia.
is preliminary analysis convinced us that using the topiccomment structure could be useful to evaluate readability and that weighting these relations could be a good cue. However, for a scalable method the text structure has to be extracted or annotated
1 trec.nist.gov

automatically. Several parsers have been developed to extract text structure such as HILDA [17] that implements topic changes or SPADE [28] which extracts rhetorical relations and has been used in [22] for example to re-rank documents. ese parsers are based on deep analysis of linguistic features and are hardly usable when large volumes of texts are involved. Moreover, they view the topiccomment relation as a remark on the statement while we consider a topic as the phrase that the rest of the clause is understood to be about as in [13].
e information structure is opposed to formal structure of a clause with grammatical elements as constituents. In contrast to a grammatical subject that is a merely grammatical category, a topic refers to the information or pragmatic structure of a clause and how it is related to other clauses. However, in a simple English clause, a topic usually coincides with a subject. One of the exceptions are expletives (e.g. it is raining) that have only a comment part [15]. Since the unmarked word order in English is Subject - Verb - Object (SVO), we can assume that a topic is usually placed before a verb. As in [13], we also assume that if a subordinate clause provides details on an object, it is rather related to a comment part. us, in our method we split a sentence into two parts by a personal verb (not in nitive nor participle) where the rst part is considered to be a topic while the rest is viewed as a comment. As opposed to other methods from the literature, this method requires only part-of-speech tagging and its computational complexity is linear over the number of words as well as the number of sentences in a text.
e key idea of our method is that in a coherent text there are relations between topic (or comment) parts of the adjacent sentences and these relations are manifested by word repetition. We represent topic and comment parts of a sentence by bag-ofwords. In order to capture the topic-comment relation, we calculate the similarity between them. We propose to use term and noun based similarities. Since the frequencies of TT, TC, CT and CC di er, it seems reasonable to weight the inter-sentence relationship between topic and comment. us, we compute the score between two adjacent sentences si-1 and si as the weighted cosine similarity between them:

sc(si-1, si )

=

|

|si

1 -1 ||

|

|si

|

|

[wt

t

(Ti -1

· Ti )

+ wct (Ci-1 · Ti ) + wtc (Ti-1 · Ci ) + wcc (Ci-1 · Ci )] (1)

where ||·|| is the length of the corresponding vector, Ti and Ci refer to the bag-of-words representations of topic or comment part of the i-th sentence respectively, the scalar product is marked by ·, wtt , wct , wtc , and wcc  [0, 1] indicate the weights of the TT, TC, CT and CC relations within the text. We estimate text coherence as an average score between adjacent sentences in a text S = (si )i|S=1| :

Coh(S )

4 EVALUATION
We conducted two series of experiments. For the rst evaluation, we used three datasets: (1) Wikipedia dump, (2) TREC Robust, and (3) WT10G. e rst dataset is a cleaned English Wikipedia

XML dump of 2012 without notes, history and bibliographic references [3]. We selected 32,211 articles retrieved by the search engine Terrier2 for the queries from INEX/CLEF Tweet Contextualization Track 2012-2013 [3]. TREC (Text Retrieval Conference) Robust dataset is an unspammed collection of news articles from e Financial Times 1991-1994, Federal Register 1994, Foreign Broadcast Information Service, and e LA Times [31]. We used 193,022 documents retrieved for 249 topics from the Robust dataset. In contrast, WT10G is a snapshot of 1997 of Internet Archive with documents in HTML format, some of which are spam [16]. We retrieved 88,879 documents for 98 topics from TREC Web track 2000-2001. Documents from Robust and WT10G may contain spelling or other errors.
As the rst baseline we used a probabilistic graphic model proposed in [18] hereina er referred to as Lapata. Because of page number constraints, we are not detailing this method in this paper.
e probabilities were learned from the Wikipedia dataset. For evaluation we calculated text score as the average score between the adjacent sentences. e second baseline TSP is a special case of our approach with equal weights for all relations. We also examined a variant of this method where the similarity is based on noun only (TSPNoun). We estimated the text coherence as the average cosine similarity between the neighboring sentences.
As in [2, 9, 20, 21, 23], we compare scores assigned to initial documents and the same documents but with randomly permuted sentences. is pairwise evaluation approach was justi ed in [21]. As in previous approaches, we assumed that the best SO is produced by a human and a good metric should re ect that by assigning higher score to initial SO. Besides, we hypothesized that a good metric has small degradation of results provoked by small permutation in SO and greater rate of shu ing provokes larger e ect since the obtained order is remoter from the human-made one.
erefore, as in [12], we consider the following types of datasets: (1) Source collection (O), (2) Rn-collection (Rn), (3) R-collection (R). R-collection is derived from the source collection by shu ing all sentences within each document. Rn-collection is generated from the source collection by a random shi of n sentences within each document. We used R1 and R2 collections. e introduction of transitional Rn-collections di ers from the approaches used in [2, 9, 20, 21, 23].
We calculated system accuracy which shows the number of times a system prefers the original order over its permutation divided by the total number of test pairs.
is approach for metric evaluation is completely automatic and requires only a text corpus.
We conducted the second set of experiments on two corpora that are widely used for SO assessment: (1) airplane Accidents from the National Transportation Safety Board and (2) articles about Earthquakes from the North American News Corpus [9, 21, 23]. Each of these corpora has 100 original texts and for each document 20 permutations (2000 in total). We compared our accuracy results with those reported in the literature, namely entity grid models (Content + Egrid, Content + HMM-prodn, Content + HMM-d-seq, Egrid + HMM-prodn, Egrid + HMM-d-seq,

In Table 1, O, R, R1 and R2 refer to the initial sentence order and the permutations described above and O > /< /= R· shows the proportion of times where initial order was scored higher/lower/equally than/to permuted text for the best set of parameter values wtt = 0.25, wct = 0.5, wtc = 0.75, and wcc = 1. Topic-comment term based method is denoted by TopCom. For all collections according to the number of times where the original order was ranked higher than the shu ed one O > R, the topic-comment approach outperformed the simple similarity-based metrics and Lapata's baseline. Smaller permutations in sentence order provoke smaller changes in the score. In general noun-based similarity is less accurate than all term based methods. It could be caused by lower probability of non-zero similarity between the adjacent sentences. However, both topic-comment based methods showed be er results than their analogues that do not consider text information structure. We varied the coe cients (wtt , wct , wtc , wcc )  {0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}4 on the Wikipedia collection. Figure 1 visualizes the correlation between the number of times where the initial document is preferred to shu ed one O > R and each coe cient with the xed values of others. Smaller values of wtt , and wct refer to higher O > R, while be er results correspond to higher wtc and wcc .

we obtained the results comparable with the state of the art. For the Earthquakes articles, the accuracy of our system is slightly lower. It can be explained by the following facts: (1) models are trained and tested separately for each dataset [9, 21, 23]; (2) datasets are very homogeneous (some articles are similar up to 90% of words) and, as noted in [9], very constrained in terms of subject and style. In contrast, the coe cients for our method were learned from the Wikipedia collection. is proves that our metric is general and not restricted by a collection but it demonstrates the results comparable with the state of the art machine learning based approaches.
5 CONCLUSIONS
We introduced a novel self-su cient metric for SO assessment based on topic-comment structure. It has linear complexity and requires only POS-tagging. We evaluated our method on three test collections where it demonstrated high accuracy and signi cantly outperformed similarity-based baselines as well as a transition probability based approach. e evaluation results allow drawing conclusions that (1) topic-comment methods are more e ective than simple similarity based approaches; (2) in general, noun-based similarity is less accurate. In contrast to the state of the art approaches, our method is general and not restricted by a collection but it demonstrates comparable results. One of the promising direction of the future work is the integration of co-reference resolution, synonyms and IDF. Another possible improvement is applying syntactic parsing and linguistic templates for topic-comment structure extraction.
