We study the problem of

event-interval sequences, or e-sequences. In contrast to se-

quences of instantaneous events, e-sequences contain events

that have a duration. In Information Retrieval applications,

e-sequences are used for American Sign Language. We show

that the subsequence-search problem is -hard and proNP

tend our algorithm to handle dierent cases of subsequence

matching with errors. We then propose the

against several indexing schemes.

1. INTRODUCTION
Event-interval sequences, or e-sequences, are used in a plethora of real-world application domains, such as linguistics [2], sensor networks [6], and health informatics [7]. They are also used in information-retrieval applications for the American Sign Language (ASL) [5]. As a result, e-sequences have lately attracted considerable attention in both the database and knowledge-discovery communities.
An example of an e-sequence is shown in Figure 1. In contrast to instantaneous event sequences, events in e-sequences have a duration. Hence, e-sequences convey richer information than instantaneous event sequences. It can be shown that information contained in e-sequences cannot be represented by instantaneous event sequences. Such an example is shown in Figure 2, where mapping e-sequences to symbolic sequences of instantaneous events creates ambiguity. Our experiments demonstrate that this type of representation error occurs in practice.
In this paper we study the following problem: given a database D of e-sequences and a query e-sequence Q, find the e-sequences in D that contain Q.
This problem applies, among others, to searching for specific phrases or grammatical constructions, among transcriptions of American Sign Language. Similarly, in Heath Informatics, a professional needs to search among medical records

2. BACKGROUND

An event-interval sequence, or e-sequence, S = {S1, . . . , S|S|} is a sequence of triples denoted Si = (Si.E, tstart, tend). The coordinates of each triple denote the label, the start-

time and end-time of each interval, respectively. For the example in Figure 1, the representation is S = {(A, 1, 10), (B, 5, 13), (C, 17, 30), (A, 20, 26), (D, 24, 30)}. We denote by |S| the length of S, which is the number of its intervals.
Note that it is also possible to have overlapping intervals

with the same label.

Any pair of intervals in an e-sequence is characterized by

a

. The set of possible relations, based on Allen's

relation

model [1], are shown in Figure 3.

We only consider relations among intervals and ignore the

absolute time durations. In American Sign Language, sen-

tences are formed based on the combination of gestures not

their duration: as with speaking, people may spend dier-

Problem

: definition

An

e-sequence

S

= {S1, . . . , Sn}

is

a

subsequence of T = {T1, . . . , Tm} if S is contained in T . S is contained in T if and only if there exists a sequence T 0

of intervals, T 0  T , T 0 = {T10, . . . , Tn0 }, such that Ti0.E = Si.E, 1  i  n and R(Si0, Sj0 ) = R(Ti0, Tj0), 1  i < j  n,

where R(·, ·) returns the relation between two intervals.

1. Theorem Subsequence matching is NP-hard.

Note that in the special case that there is no overlap between intervals, the problem can be solved in polynomial
ssm time, as it reduces to subsequence matching in strings.
Another special case is to require that, for a query Q, the matched intervals in S are contiguous. This is also a polynomial variant, which can be solved in time O(|S||Q|2).
Algorithm: We present an exact algorithm, Algorithm 1, for determining if an e-sequence Q is a subsequence of S. The algorithm also returns the matching positions. It maintains a partial list that is used for backtracking.
The algorithm scans the larger e-sequence S to find the first interval that shares the same label with the first interval in Q (lines 4,5). If such an interval is never found, the procedure will terminate. Suppose that an interval is found. As it is the first pair matched, no further checks are needed. Then, another interval with the same label as that of the second interval in Q is searched for in S. Searching for succeeding intervals happens recursively (line 13), for the remainders of the S and Q. A variable list solSoFar keeps

the partial solution and is appended a new interval (line 9)

or has an interval removed from the end (line 17); if Q is

found in S, then upon termination solSoFar contains the

corresponding intervals of S. Using this variable facilitates

backtracking. Line 6 contains a check as to whether an in-

terval in S, which has been found to have the same label as

the next in Q, forms the same relations as those that are

required by Q.

There exist

|S| |Q|

possible matchings between Q and S;

when all interval labels are the same. However, dierent la-

bels and the backtracking due to interval relations eliminate

a large number of candidates and reduce the running time.

Algorithm 1 solves the problem of Problem variations: exact subsequence matching. However it can easily be modified to handle a number of variations, such as: · The sets of labels are considered equivalent. In other
words, we do not require strict matching of labels, but instead we allow substitutions. This is easily implemented by replacing the equality condition of line 5 with the desired equivalence function. · A number of non-identical interval-relations are tolerated. In addition to solSoFar, we may use a second variable list that denotes how many relations with preceding intervals in solSoFar are violated when choosing solSoFar[i]. · A number of non-identical labels are tolerated. As above, we may use a variable list to maintain the errors. · Pathological matchings are avoided. As with the SakoeChiba Band [8] and the Itakura Parallelogram [4] for Dynamic Time Warping, we can force limits on the distance between consecutive intervals in S that get matched to Q. This is achieved by changing the limits of line 4.

4. INDEXING
When searching a very large dataset, sequential scan is prohibitive. An indexing scheme is required to improve the retrieval speed. We experiment with several approaches, each providing dierent trade-os. We begin by describing the proposed indexing scheme, named Relation Index, while

the rest serve as baseline methods. All schemes guarantee a 100% recall rate: they return a superset of the valid result.

Relation Index: this approach decomposes each e-sequence into a set of 2-interval e-sequences. Then it relies on an

inverted index for performing look-ups. The keys in this

inverted index are triples of the form (i, j, relk), with i, j 2  and relk a type of relation. Each index key is

associated with the list of e-sequence IDs that contain that

specific combination.

In the

index-construction phase

D, we enumerate all

|S| 2

pairs of intervals and obtain their

relation. For each formed triple (i, j, relk), the ID of that

e-sequence is appended to the appropriate list in the index.

In the

, a set of interval pairs of the query e-

retrieval phase

sequence Q is enumerated, and the set of triples (i, j, relk)

is produced. There are two approaches for choosing the set

of interval pairs, as illustrated also in Figure 5:

1. Quadratic: all

pairs are enumerated.

2.

: only |Q| 1 pairs are enumerated; those are ex-

Linear

tracted serially by examining only pairs of consecutive in-

tervals, i.e. (Qi, Qi+1), 1  i  |Q| 1.

Given the set of produced triples, we first retrieve the car-

dinality of the index list of IDs for each key and we sort

the keys in ascending order. The sorting helps speed-up the

remainder of the process. Note that the set of values corre-

sponding to the first key (the one with the fewer e-sequences

containing that particular structure), is already a superset of

the valid results for |Q|. Then, starting from the two smaller

sets, we compute their intersection and then the intersection

of the result with the third smallest set, etc. The process

terminates when all intersections have been computed, or

when the intersection contains at most one element.

: This approach is similar to the above, but Label Index it diers in the type of keys. Instead of having an inverted index for sub-structures of two intervals, we simply create an inverted index for the interval labels. The two aforementioned approaches demonstrate a trade-o between the size of the structures used as keys in the inverted index (the labels correspond to single intervals) and the index size.

: E-sequences are represented only by the Bitmap Index count of each label of the intervals they contain. In order for a query e-sequence Q to be a subsequence of an e-sequence S, it is a necessary, but not su cient, requirement for S to contain at least as many intervals of each label as those contained in Q. In order to provide fast lookup for each label count, we use hash tables. When searching in the Bitmap Index, each hash table needs to be examined.

: This is the baseline for indexing methods String Index that map e-sequences to strings; each e-sequence in D is represented as a string. The tokens of the strings are the

interval-labels, ordered in the same way as the intervals. For a query e-sequence Q to be a subsequence of an e-sequence S, it is a necessary, but not su cient, requirement for the string representation of Q to be a subsequence of the string representation of S (easy proof omitted). All strings need to be examined, and the time complexity of each operation is O(|S|), hence the total time required for a single search is O(|D||S|). We may also transform e-sequences into strings as in Figure 2, but it creates sequences of double length. We refer to this scheme as Cpoint Index.

: We convert e-sequences to graphs, as Graph Indexing described by Kostakis and Papapetrou [5], and then apply

graph indexing techniques. We experimented with gIndex

and

implementations provided by Han et al. [3].

5. EXPERIMENTS

We evaluate the exact ssm algorithm and two of its variations on three real datasets, detailed in Table 1.

The variations of that we evaluated are the following: ssm
(i) a number of non-identical interval relations are tolerated,

and (ii) a number of non-identical interval labels are toler-

ated.

The number of allowed errors takes values in [0,

|Q| 2

]

for the case of relations, and in [0, |Q|] for the case of labels.

In comparison to the exact algorithm, these variations ssm
investigate more branches of the recursion tree, hence re-

quire longer run time. In addition, we expect a higher run

time when we increase the number of allowed mismatches.

Simply due to the fact that when the algorithm backtracks,

this happens at a deeper stage. The expected size of the

candidate set increases, too.

We employ a synthetic dataset generator to create very

large datasets for benchmarking the indexing methods. We

create datasets of one million e-sequences and alphabet size,

||, equal to 5, 50 and 500. Each e-sequence has length 100.

The indexing methods are benchmarked in terms of retrieval

time and size of returned candidate set.

For all experiments, for each e-sequence in the dataset, we

randomly select a number of intervals and query the dataset

for the induced subsequence. The selected size ratios for

|Q|/|S|, are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.99.

: Approximate matchResults on matching variations ing with allowed relation errors was faster than the one with allowed label errors; by several orders of magnitude in some cases. Both were slower than the exact algorithm. As expected, the approximate e-sequence matching variations returned larger candidate sets than the exact version. In addition, the size increased with the allowed error rate. The same holds for the run times. Figure 6 depicts the results for the ASL dataset. For the Hepatitis and sensor network datasets the increase in run times was more significant.

an e-sequence of 100 intervals corresponds to a complete

edges.

The

number

of edges is at least two orders of magnitude larger than those

used by Han et al. [3]. Thus, we were unable to acquire any

results for the datasets we experimented with.

In general, the query times for String, Cpoint and Bitmap

Index increase linearly with respect to the size of the data-

base. As expected, this is due to the fact that they perform

a linear scan and need to check all instances in D.

For || = 500, all methods managed to find the single

correct counterparts in all cases; precision 100%. Figure 7

shows the run times. Relation Index is two orders of magni-

tude faster than Bitmap Index and three orders faster than

String Index. Due to the large alphabet size, each combina-

tion of interval labels appears few times, hence few lookups

in the inverted index su ce to identify the unique candidate.

For || = 5, for small query lengths the candidate sets are

not singletons. In Figure 8 we notice that for query length

ratio of 0.1, Bitmap and Label index compete in runtime

with Relation Index but, including String and Cpoint In-

dex, they are practically useless since they return the whole

database. Only Relation Index is able to provide moderate

pruning of the candidate set. The true candidate set is 27%

of D, while Relation Index returns 60% of the DB.

For || = 50, Relation Index remains at least an order of

magnitude faster than the rest; Figure 9. Surprisingly, for

small query lengths, it returns marginally more candidates

than String Index. This is due to the fact that Relation

Index retains no information on the location in the original

e-sequence of the intervals involved in the relation. Hence, it

may consider relations that do not correspond to the query's

location in the e-sequence. On the other hand, its query time

decreases significantly for larger query lengths, because it

performs fewer intersections.

6. CONCLUSIONS
We studied the problem of subsequence search in databases of event-interval sequences, or e-sequences. We showed that the problem is NP-hard and provided an exact algorithm. We showed how to extend the exact algorithm to handle dierent cases of subsequence matching with errors. Finally, we proposed the Relation Index, a scheme that relies on decomposing e-sequences into pairs of intervals, for speeding up retrieval time. We benchmarked the proposed index against several baselines, including graph indexing schemes.
We witness that Relation Index is superior in terms of run time compared to the other methods. While string indexing methods can be applied, they are ine cient for cases of small alphabet size. Between the linear and quadratic variants of Relation Index, the first is usually faster but the later is more e cient in pruning, when the alphabet size is small.
