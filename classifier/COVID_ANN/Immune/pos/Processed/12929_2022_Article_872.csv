6,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causal agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a systemic illness characterized by variably severe pulmonary symptoms, cardiac conduction abnormalities, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding, as well as neurologic deficits, renal insufficiency, myalgias, endocrine abnormalities, and other perturbations that reflect widespread microvascular injury and a pro-inflammatory state. The mechanisms underlying the various manifestations of viral infection are incompletely understood but most data suggest that severe COVID-19 results from virus-driven perturbations in the immune system and resultant tissue injury. Aberrant interferon-related responses lead to alterations in cytokine elaboration that deplete resident immune cells while simultaneously recruiting hyperactive macrophages and functionally altered neutrophils, thereby tipping the balance from adaptive immunity to innate immunity. Disproportionate activation of these macrophages and neutrophils further depletes normal activity of B-cells, T-cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. In addition, this proinflammatory state stimulates uncontrolled complement activation and development of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETS), both of which promote the coagulation cascade and induce a state of ""thrombo-inflammation"". These perturbations have similar manifestations in multiple organ systems, which frequently show pathologic findings related to microvascular injury and thrombosis of large and small vessels. However, the pulmonary findings in patients with severe COVID-19 are generally more pronounced than those of other organs. Not only do they feature inflammatory thromboses and endothelial injury, but much of the parenchymal damage stems from failed maturation of alveolar pneumocytes, interactions between type 2 pneumocytes and non-resident macrophages, and a greater degree of NET formation. The purpose of this review is to discuss the pathogenesis underlying organ damage that can occur in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding these mechanisms of injury is important to development of future therapies for patients with COVID-19, many of which will likely target specific components of the immune system, particularly NET induction, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and subpopulations of immune cells.",1.0,respiratory,True

17,"Viral structure and cell entry SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that contains four major types of proteins: nucleocapsid, membrane, envelope, and spike proteins. The spike protein is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2, that are required for viral entry into cells. The S1 subunit binds the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, whereas S2 is cleaved by transmembrane serine protease-2 (TMPRSS2), thereby facilitating viral fusion with the cell membrane [2]. Heavy glycosylation of spike protein shields it from the immune system and modulates the conformational dynamics of the receptor binding domain located on S1, thereby ensuring viral interactions with ACE2 [3]. The viral burden is highest in tissues expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, such as epithelia of the tracheobronchial tree, type 2 pneumocytes (AT2 cells), endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, and epithelial cells of the small bowel and colon. This distribution of cell susceptibility partly explains the constellation of symptoms commonly encountered among patients with COVID-19 [4-6].",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
18,"In addition to ACE2 and TMPRSS2, other proteins can facilitate viral entry in a site-specific fashion. ACE2 is expressed in combination with cathepsin L in alveolar type 1 pneumocytes (AT1 cells) and AT2 cells, enterocytes, cardiomyocytes, and the placenta [7]. Cathepsins activate IL-1 and NLRP3-mediated inflammatory cascades that cause cell apoptosis or pyroptosis, and they play important roles in matrix remodeling, neutrophil recruitment, and emergency myelopoiesis. Viral attachment to the cell is facilitated by heparan sulfate, while furin-like cleavage sites on spike protein promote viral replication in the lung [8, 9]. Neuropilin1 (NRP1) binds these furin-derived substrates and assists viral entry into nasal cells [8, 9].

20,"Mechanisms of tissue injury due to SARSCoV2 Many of the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are related to virus-driven perturbations in the immune system and resultant tissue injury. Combinations of these changes can be distilled into three distinct groups based on aberrant interferon-related responses, cytokine alterations, recruitment of functionally altered immune cells, and uncontrolled complement activation with associated neutrophil extracellular traps (NETS) and systemic thrombosis. These groups include (1) humoral immunodeficiency with B-cell defects, (2) a hyperinflammatory state characterized by loss of T-cell subsets and high cytokine levels driven by IL-6, IL-1, TNF-, and (3) complement-driven injury [11]. These mechanisms are described further below.",1.0,clinical,True
21,"Interferonrelated responses Interferon (IFN)-related responses represent important components of the host defense against viral infections. Interferons are broadly classified as types I, II, and III: type I IFNs bind to the IFN-/ receptor, type II IFN (IFN-) is activated by IL-12, and type III IFNs signal through either IL-10R2 (IL-10 receptor 2 subunit) or IFNLR-1 (interferon lambda receptor 1) complexes. Although IFNs are important components of the fight against viral infections, they can also promote tissue injury when present in excess, indicating that timing and organ location determine the net effects of IFN-mediated immune responses [12]. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells show increased type I IFN profiles that correlate with viral loads early in the disease course, followed by decreasing type I IFN as viral levels fall. However, IFN-related responses tend to be reduced or delayed in patients with severe COVID-19 [13]. Suboptimal IFNrelated responses in this setting may be due to genetic influences, neutralizing autoantibodies, or depleted numbers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells that produce TLR7, a toll-like receptor that detects single-stranded viral ribonucleic acids and promotes IFN-related responses [14].",1.0,disease,True
22,"Interferon levels vary among different tissues and tend to correlate with disease severity among COVID-19 patients. Type I IFN-related responses are important in early infection, although they are also persistently elevated among patients with sustained viral replication. Increased type II IFN is associated with severe disease at all sites, whereas type III IFN is mostly seen in the upper airways of patients with mild disease and high viral loads [15, 16]. It is possible that type III IFN-related responses in the upper airways are responsible for clearing SARSCoV-2 but when anti-viral efforts fail, the balance shifts",1.0,disease,True

26,"Data from animal models support the idea that severe COVID-19 is a consequence of failed IFN-driven antiviral activities. Ferrets with pneumonia due to SARSCOV-2 usually clear the virus, rather than succumb to it. These animals have increased M1 macrophages with anti-viral profiles (e.g., IL-1, CXCL8, and type I IFN) early in disease then switch to an anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage response in the resolution phases of disease [18]. On the other hand, aged ferrets have higher viral loads in their respiratory tracts, and they tend to develop more severe disease characterized by persistent T-cell activation and a M1 macrophage response without a timely switch to the M2 macrophage-mediated resolution phase. Persistent CXCL10 secreted by these macrophages functions as a chemoattractant for monocyte/ macrophages, NK cells, and T-cells, thereby driving the inflammatory state [19]. These observations suggest that severe COVID-19 in humans may result from a persistent M1 response without the M2 shift.",1.0,COVID-19,True

28,"Epithelial cells also elaborate MCP1/CCL2, CCL3, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL10, IL-8/CXCL8, IL-1, and TNF-; these cytokines recruit macrophages and further promote tissue damage [27]. As the disease progresses, normal alveolar macrophages are ultimately depleted and replaced by pro-inflammatory macrophages [28]. These HLA-DR-low/S100A-high monocytes are spatially related to epithelial cells, creating a sustained interface between epithelial and immune cells that promotes immune activation [12, 27, 29]. Similar alterations are seen in the lungs of African green monkeys, in which case viral replication in pneumocytes drives the immune response by spreading to macrophages as they ingest debris. In this situation, the macrophages that are recruited to the lung drive the immune response, rather than resident alveolar macrophages [30].",1.0,disease,True
29,"Cytokine responses Compared with influenza, the pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection features a greater degree of neutrophil degranulation and increased cytokine levels, particularly IL-1, IL-1RA, TNF-, G-CSF, CCL7, CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL11, and CXCL12a [20]. SARSCoV-2 infection can also precipitate macrophage activation syndrome, which is characterized by increased type II IFN-related responses as well as elevated IL-6, IL-1, TNF-, and ferritin levels [21]. Patients with severe COVID-19 typically have increased serum levels of IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, TNF-, MCP1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, IL-18, and MIP-1/CCL3, which promote a sustained pro-inflammatory state that may persist for up to 60 days [22, 23].",1.0,flu,True
30,"Cellular recruitment and functional perturbations Innate immunity SARS-CoV-2 infection promotes an imbalance between innate and adaptive immunity that becomes more pronounced when patients develop severe symptoms. Mild disease is characterized by an adaptive immune response with robust recruitment of plasmablasts and CD8+T-cells [13]. However, more severe disease features a predominance of innate immunity with elaboration of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-1 and TNF-) accompanied by lymphopenia and a decrease in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, as well as markers of T-cell exhaustion [14].

Infected patients have increased ratios of naïve to memory CD4+T-cells and decreased T-regulatory cell populations, especially those modulating allergic responses and autoimmunity [31]. In addition, SARSCoV-2 infection stimulates Th1 cells, Th2 cells, and Th17 cells, the net effect of which is an elaboration of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17,",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
32,"IL-21, IL-22, and G-CSF. Of these, IL-17 is specifically associated with autoimmunity, whereas G-CSF promotes neutrophilic activation [32]. Patients with severe disease also have increased numbers of LAG3positive T-cells. This T-cell subset is responsible for IL-10 production, which further reduces the cytotoxic effects of CD8+T-cells and suppresses IFN-mediated responses [33]. Alterations in T-cells occur in combination with decreased B-cell evolution in germinal centers, as evidenced by increased unmutated IGH clones and plasmablasts [12]. Abnormal circulating monocytes elaborate S100A8 and S100A9, which drive emergency myelopoiesis, suppress normal T-cell function, and delay viral clearance. Increased IFN- levels also activate NK cells to promote interferon-mediated responses that, when sustained, can lead to NK cell dysfunction and loss [14].

Chromatin strands are studded with citrullinated histones, antimicrobial proteins, and cytokines, such that they can entrap and kill pathogens upon release from neutrophils undergoing apoptosis. NETs immobilize and clear organisms by positioning viruses in direct contact with anti-viral proteins. NET formation is associated with increased IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8, RANTES/ CCL5 and platelet factor 4, and can be induced directly by viable SARS-CoV-2 [34, 35].

Importantly, the histologic hallmarks of NETs, namely neutrophils associated with microthrombosis (Fig. 1A), likely account for clinically severe COVID-19 pneumonia [39, 40].

Specifically, patients with severe COVID-19 and high body mass indices tend to have increased IL-6 levels, endothelial injury, IFN activation, and cytokine profiles (e.g., IFN-, IL15, IL17, MCP1/ CCL2, MIP1-beta/CCL4) that suggest macrophage recruitment [51].

45,"Several genetic factors may place patients at risk for severe COVID-19. Polymorphisms of OAS1, 2, and 3 represent possible susceptibility loci because they normally activate latent RNAse activity and promote resistance to RNA viruses.

The combination of real-time tissue banking from blood and autopsy material for use in high-throughput multi-omics techniques led to rapid advancement in the understanding of inflammatory mechanisms underlying disease progression. Imaging mass cytometry showed SARS-COV-2 to predominantly infect lung epithelial cells, although other cell types also contain viral proteins. The levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 on AT1 and AT2 cells suggest susceptibility to viral entry, and that increased ACE2-positive cells mirror the development of AT2 hyperplasia in severe disease. AT2 cells and macrophages propagate an IFN-mediated response, neutrophil degranulation, and cellular recruitment via MIP-1/CCL3 and MIP-1/ CCL4 through the effects of IL-6 and IL-1.

Some patients develop severe, rapidly progressive DAD resulting from the combined effects of direct viral infection (Fig. 2B, C), immune-mediated injury, and thrombosis, whereas others suffer progressive respiratory failure with organizing DAD.

84,"It is worth noting that direct viral infection of the gastrointestinal tract is likely a transient event that causes few, or no symptoms. Most gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 are probably secondary to cytokine elaboration, hypercoagulability, and microvascular injury triggered by the virus, rather than direct viral cytotoxicity. Westerhoff, et al. evaluated gastrointestinal specimens from 25 patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal testing but could not consistently demonstrate detectable virus in the gastrointestinal tract, even when inflammatory or ischemic-type changes were present in the samples [96]. Zhang et al. also failed to identify SARS-CoV-2 by either immunohistochemistry for the nucleocapsid protein or in situ hybridization for viral spike protein RNA when evaluating 28 bowel resection cases from patients with COVID-19 [97].",1.0,COVID-19,True
85,"Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are prone to coagulopathies and, thus, gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 most commonly include ischemic-type changes with thrombi in the small and/or large intestines [98-103]. These changes may develop days to weeks after viral detection and onset of pulmonary symptoms and, thus, ancillary studies generally fail to demonstrate the organism in biopsy and resection specimens [104, 105]. Patchy mucosal hemorrhage and fibrin thrombi in small capillaries may be present in biopsies obtained upon onset of gastrointestinal symptoms, at which point the background mucosa may be normal or show epithelial cell regeneration with cytoplasmic depletion and mild nuclear enlargement (Fig. 5C, D). Resection specimens show more extensive ulcers with thrombi in small and large submucosal veins, as well as patchy necrosis of the muscularis propria. In the previously cited study, Zhang et al. reported frequent fibrin thrombi, strands of fibrin in non-occluded enteric vessels, and a high rate (60%) of pneumatosis in patients with ischemic enterocolitis due to COVID-19 compared with patients who had ischemic enterocolitis due to other causes. The same authors also described a minority of cases that showed patchy fibrosis of the outer muscularis propria, suggestive of chronic ischemic injury [97].",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
86,"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can promote epithelial cell damage in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in diarrheal symptoms rather than signs and symptoms of bleeding (Fig. 5E, F). The virus downregulates ACE2 expression on the gut epithelium, which diminishes the counterregulatory effects of ACE2 on angiotensin II-mediated signaling and increases inflammation [106].

88,"The pancreas Type I diabetes mellitus is characterized by immunemediated destruction of the islets of Langerhans in genetically susceptible patients, most of whom have either HLA-DR3 or HLA-DR4 haplotypes [108]. Its pathogenesis is not entirely clear, but there is ample evidence that some RNA viruses, namely rotaviruses and coxsackieviruses, contribute to disease development and persist in islet -cells for prolonged periods of time. Viral entry into -cells can cause direct cytotoxic injury, resulting in cell death. Alternatively, elaboration of viral antigens combined with -cell-specific antigens, evokes an immune response that results in -cell destruction, especially in the context of increased IFN production and upregulation of class I major histocompatibility complexes [109].",1.0,disease,True
89,"Early in the pandemic, it became clear that patients with diabetes mellitus were at risk for more severe SARSCoV-2 infections [50]. However, emerging data also suggest an increased risk for new-onset diabetes mellitus, as well as metabolic complications of pre-existing diabetes mellitus among patients with resolving COVID-19. The effects of COVID-19 on glucose homeostasis are likely multifactorial. -cells express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, as well as other entry factors, such as neuropilin-1 (NP-1), transferrin receptor (TFRC), FURIN, CTSL, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) [110, 111]. Like rotaviruses and coxsackieviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can directly damage -cells and induce apoptosis once inside the cell [110, 111]. However, it also downregulates insulin gene transcription, while glucagon and other peptides are upregulated, and causes transdifferentiation of -cells to express both endocrine and acinar markers [112]. Viral binding depletes ACE2 at the cell surface and diminishes its counterregulatory effects on angiotensin II-mediated signaling. Activation of the renin-angiotensin pathway further promotes insulin resistance, inflammation, and -cell dysfunction [113].",1.0,pandemic,True
90,"Dermatologic manifestations of COVID19 The cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 are broadly grouped in six patterns of injury: confluent erythematous/maculopapular/morbilliform rash, urticarial rash, papulovesicular exanthem, Chilblain-like acral pattern, livedo reticularis/racemose-like pattern, and purpuric pattern [114].

93,"inflammation of dermal vessels. Nearly 50% of patients with rashes related to SARS-CoV-2 have erythematous or maculopapular eruptions that develop after the onset of systemic symptoms. These lesions tend to be pruritic and show a symmetrical distribution over the trunk with progression in a centrifugal fashion [115]. Although data are scarce, these eruptions seem to reflect some type of vascular injury, often with perivascular lymphocytic or neutrophilic infiltrates [116, 117]. Urticarial rashes are most pronounced over the trunk and limbs and may be accompanied by angioedema or urticarial vasculitis [118]. They usually present at the same time as other systemic symptoms although they can precede pulmonary disease manifestations in occasional patients. Papulovesicular exanthems typically feature scattered vesicles over the trunk with, or without, pruritis [114]. Biopsies reveal epidermal acantholysis with ballooned keratinocytes and endothelial inflammation in dermal vessels [119].",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
94,"Chilblain-like acral pattern, livedo reticularis/racemose-like pattern, and purpuric pattern eruptions typically feature both endothelial damage and thromboses, possibly due to IFN-mediated inflammatory reactions or endothelial injury secondary to circulating viral particles [120]. Chilblain-like lesions appear as violaceous plaques predominantly located on the feet with occasional involvement of the hands or ears. These lesions are commonly painful or itchy and, unlike other dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19, tend to occur in patients with minimal, or no, systemic symptoms [121]. The livedo reticularis/racemose-like pattern appears as lace-like dusky patches of blue discoloration and likely reflects slow blood flow secondary to thrombosis of small superficial vessels in the dermis. Magro et al. described three patients with this pattern of injury, all of whom had a pauci-inflammatory microthrombotic vasculopathy, leading the authors to hypothesize that thrombosis resulted from complement activation in the absence of an appropriate IFN-related immune response [120, 122]. In contrast, the purpuric pattern of injury represents a true vasculitis likely secondary to direct endothelial damage by viral particles [123]. This hemorrhagic blistering or nodular rash tends to occur in intertriginous regions or show an acral distribution. Biopsy samples demonstrate a leukocytoclastic vasculitis with fibrin thrombi and injured endothelial cells [124].",1.0,COVID-19,True
95,"Conclusions The normal anti-viral response initially involves type I IFN elaboration from NK cells and CD8+T-cells, ultimately killing infected cells and clearing the virus, whereas severe viral infections elicit IL-8/CXCL8 activation that promotes neutrophil chemotaxis, activation, and NET formation. This process is regulated by",1.0,anti-viral,True
96,"plasmacytoid dendritic cells that both produce type I IFN and decrease IL-8/CXCL8 production [125]. Dysregulation of these immune responses is central to development of COVID-19, as the combined effects of lymphopenia, reduced NK cells and CD8+T-cells, and decreased plasmacytoid dendritic cells diminish type I IFN-mediated responses and causes a shift toward IL-8/ CXCL8-induced neutrophil recruitment [126]. Continued induction of MCP1/CCL2, CXCL10, IL-6, TNF- and IL-1 combined with terminal complement activation further stimulate neutrophil activity, culminating in NET formation and an environment conducive to inflammatory thromboses [126]. These perturbations have similar manifestations in multiple organ systems, which generally show pathologic findings related to microvascular injury and thrombosis of large and small vessels. However, the pulmonary findings in patients with severe COVID-19 are generally more pronounced than those of other organs. Not only do they feature inflammatory thromboses and endothelial injury, but much of the parenchymal damage stems from failed maturation of alveolar pneumocytes, interactions between AT2 cells and non-resident macrophages, and a greater degree of NET formation. Understanding these mechanisms of injury is important to development of future therapies for patients with COVID-19, many of which will likely target specific components of the immune system, particularly NET induction, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and specific subpopulations of immune cells.",1.0,COVID-19,True
