10,"SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination induces robust humoral and cellular immunity in the circulation; however, it is currently unknown whether it elicits effective immune responses in the respiratory tract, particularly against variants of concern (VOCs), including Omicron. We compared the SARS-CoV-2 S-specific total and neutralizing antibody responses, and B and T cell immunity, in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and blood of COVID-19 vaccinated individuals and hospitalized patients. Vaccinated individuals had significantly lower levels of neutralizing antibody against D614G, Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron BA.1.1 in the BAL compared to COVID-19 convalescents, despite robust S-specific antibody responses in the blood. Furthermore, mRNA vaccination induced circulating S-specific B and T cell immunity, but in contrast to COVID-19 convalescents, these responses were absent in the BAL of vaccinated individuals. Using a mouse immunization model, we demonstrated that systemic mRNA vaccination alone induced weak respiratory mucosal neutralizing antibody responses, especially against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1.1 in mice; however, a combination of systemic mRNA vaccination plus mucosal adenovirus-S immunization induced strong neutralizing antibody responses, not only against the ancestral virus but also the Omicron BA.1.1 variant. Together, our study supports the contention that the current COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against severe disease development, likely through recruiting circulating B and T cell responses during reinfection, but offer limited protection against breakthrough infection, especially by Omicron sublineage. Hence, mucosal booster vaccination is needed to establish robust sterilizing immunity in the respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2, including infection by Omicron sublineage and future VOCs.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sublineage, easily escapes both vaccine and infection-elicited antibody neutralization in the blood (8-14). It is currently unclear whether efficient mucosal neutralizing antibody responses can be induced by vaccination, and/or natural infection, and to what extent this could protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",1.0,respiratory,True
19,"Previous studies have examined the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine induced humoral and cellular immunity in the nasal mucosa (15, 16). However, it is still controversial whether intramuscular mRNA immunization can induce meaningful neutralizing antibodies and tissue-resident T and B cells in the nasal tissue (17, 18), potentially in part due to the limited amount of fluids/cells that can be sampled in nasal washes or nasal swabs. Thus, the current understanding on the COVID19 vaccine-induced mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract remains largely elusive.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Similar to what was previously shown (3, 20), COVID-19 vaccination induced robust S1 or RBD-specific plasma IgG at levels comparable to severe cases of natural infection (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1A). The S1 or RBD-specific IgG levels in the BAL were also comparable between COVID-19-vaccinated and convalescent groups (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1B). Compared to unvaccinated donor, COVID19 convalescents exhibited moderate but detectable S1-specific IgA responses in the blood (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1C). Importantly, prior severe SARS-CoV-2 infection provoked significant levels of S1 or RBD-specific IgA in the respiratory mucosa, which was not the case for COVID-19 vaccination (Fig. 1E and Fig. S1D). The lack of notable IgA production in the respiratory mucosal appeared to contrast with the detection of moderate but significant IgA responses in the saliva following mRNA vaccination (21, 22). We also examined IgM in the blood and BAL, and observed that, while detectable levels of IgM were present in the circulation of both COVID19-vaccination group and prior infection cases, only prior infection elicited significantly elevated IgM responses in the BAL (Fig. S1E-H).",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
25,"Given the existence of cross-reactive and neutralizing antibodies against non-S1 or RBD epitopes (23-25), we further examined binding antibody response against Spike protein and Nucleocapsid protein, which would have informed potential unidentified infection. COVID-19 convalescents showed significantly higher S-specific IgG, IgA and N-specific IgG, but not S-specific IgM levels in blood, compared to those of vaccinated (Fig. S1 I-L). Similar results were found in the BAL (Fig. S1 M-P). Importantly, and consistent with results of S1 or RBD-specific IgA, significant level of S-specific IgA was observed both in BAL and blood from convalescents but not vaccinated individuals (Fig. S1 M, O).

While COVID-19 vaccinated and convalescent individuals exhibited comparable high levels of circulating neutralizing antibody responses against all VOCs, the Delta and Omicron BA.1.1 variants exhibited more than 2and 10-fold decrease in neutralization titer (NT50), respectively, compared to D614G (Fig. 2 A-C and Fig. S2 A-E), consistent with recent results showing that VOCs, especially Omicron sublineage, have significant immune evasion capability (8-14, 28-30).",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

The titers for the Omicron BA.1.1 variants were mostly below the level of detection in the BAL (Fig. 2F and Fig. S2H), reflecting the stronger escape of Omicron BA.1.1 from BAL neutralizing antibodies (Fig. S2I, J). Of note, one out of three who had received a third booster vaccination exhibited above-the-threshold yet low level of neutralization activity against Omicron BA.1.1 (Fig. 2F and Fig. S2I), suggesting that third booster vaccine may offer some, but limited, levels of protection.

32,"Although memory T and B cells do not confer sterilizing immunity, they are important in constraining viral dissemination and protecting against severe diseases once a virus breaches neutralizing humoral immunity (31-34). Both circulating and tissue-resident memory T and B cells are believed to provide disease protection against severe respiratory viral infection (35-38).We therefore examined systemic and tissue residing memory T and B cell responses following mRNA vaccination or natural infection. Compared to unvaccinated controls, vaccinated individuals had higher RBD-specific B cells in the blood (Fig. S3 A-D). Notably, RBD-specific B cells were markedly lower in BAL compared to those of PBMCs (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3E). As reported before (38, 39), vaccination induced notable S-specific TNF or IFN- producing CD8+ or CD4+ T cells in the circulation but failed to elicit strong Sspecific cytokine-producing CD8+ or CD4+ T cell responses in the BAL (Fig. 3B, C and Fig. S4). In contrast, convalescent BAL exhibited much higher RBD-specific B cells compared to the paired blood samples (Fig. 3D), suggesting that vaccination does not induce tissue-residing memory B cell responses as effectively as natural infection. Further, BAL from COVID19 convalescents had higher cytokine-producing CD8+ and CD4 T+ cells than those of blood (Fig. 3E, F), although paired analysis was not performed here due to the availability of the samples obtained from a previous study (19). Within the total CD8+ or CD4+ T cell compartments, the levels of most memory T cell subsets in the blood and/or BAL were quite similar between unvaccinated or vaccinated individuals, except the blood central memory T cell population (Fig. S4).

35,"current COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, we used a mouse model to identify potential strategies that promote and/or amplify mucosal humoral and cellular immunity after mRNA vaccination. To this end, we immunized wild type C57BL/6 mice with PBS, two doses of mRNA-encoding codon-optimized S (mRNA-S), three doses of mRNA-S, two doses of mRNA-S plus an intranasal immunization of S protein trimer with adjuvant (STING ligand, cGAMP (40)), or two doses of mRNA-S plus an intranasal of adenovirus type 5 encoding S protein (Ad5-S) (Fig. 4A). We focused on intranasal immunization in mRNA-immunized mice, in keeping the contention that induction of mucosal immunity likely occurs in previously vaccinated individuals who will be willing to receive mucosal booster vaccines. mRNA plus Ad5-S vaccination induced greatly increased BAL RBD-specific B cells (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, mRNA plus Ad5-S vaccination induced potent mucosal CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses but not in the spleen, while mRNA plus cGAMP/S trimer immunization led to robust CD4+ T cell responses in the spleen (Fig. 4C and Fig. S5). mRNA immunization, with or without the third dose of mucosal immunization, induced strong circulating S1 or RBD-specific IgG in the blood and the BAL (Fig. 4D and Fig. S6A). A third dose of mucosal immunization of S protein, with S trimer plus cGAMP or Ad5-S, resulted in significant increases of both S1 and RBD-specific IgA in the BAL (Fig. 4E), with Ad5-S inducing the highest RBD-specific IgA in the respiratory mucosa (Fig. 4E).

Furthermore, S1 or RBD- specific IgG and IgM levels were higher in plasma, BAL, as well as nasal wash after mRNA-S plus Ad5-S immunization compared to those of Ad5-S immunization alone (Fig. S7 D-I). Additionally, mRNA-S plus Ad5-S immunization induced strong antigen-specific T cell responses, particularly in the BAL (Fig. S7 J-N).

Consistent with the idea, several recent large clinical studies have revealed that mRNA vaccination is relatively less efficient in the protection against infection compared to prior natural infection during the Delta wave (42-44). Of note, the Omicron BA.1.1 variant almost completely escaped the neutralization activity of BAL from either vaccinated or previously infected individuals. Additionally, we provide compelling real-world evidence that mRNA vaccination does not induce notable lung tissue-residing S-specific memory B and T cells. Thus,",1.0,COVID-19,True
45,"despite the induction of robust circulating humoral and cellular immunity, current COVID-19 mRNA vaccines likely do not provoke sufficient levels of mucosal immunity in the human lower respiratory tract that would be needed for immediate clearance of the infectious Omicron BA.1.1 variant to prevent the establishment of infection. Such a notion is consistent with the fact that the Omicron sublineage continues to spread at a rapid pace in regions with high rates of vaccination and/or prior natural infection.",1.0,COVID-19,True
46,"Our data do not dispute the notion that current vaccines are highly effective in preventing hospitalization and death. The prevention of severe disease after infection is conferred mainly by memory T and B cells (38, 45). To this end, CD8 T cell epitopes within Omicron Spike protein remain conserved to those of ancestral strains (46-48). Thus, even though Omicron is able to breach the defense of mucosal neutralizing antibody to cause infection, the recruitment of vaccine-induced circulating memory T cells during SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection enables protection that restrains further viral dissemination, preventing severe disease development following infection. Nevertheless, these data suggest that mucosal humoral immunity is particularly vulnerable for immune escape by Omicron BA.1.1 and other sublineage. It is thus quite likely that the current vaccine strategy, even with further boosters, will not achieve ""herd immunity"" or prevent the occurrence of new infections or re-infections with future VOCs, particularly those with immune-evasive properties like Omicron sublineage. Thus, our findings have significant public health implications.",1.0,vaccine,True

Mucosal adenovirus delivery has concerns of safety and applicability on a large scale. However, an Ad5-S based mucosal booster strategy in vaccinated individuals has been found safe and induced stronger plasma antibody responses (49). Thus, an adenoviral booster vaccine potentially has great translational and clinical relevance.

Whether this is due to the strong RBD-specific IgA responses present in the respiratory mucosa following natural infection or mucosal Ad5-S booster immunization is currently unknown. Of note, prior studies have identified that viral infection can lead to persistent germinal center reaction and antibody production in the lung (51, 52). Therefore, local antigen-specific IgG or IgA produced in situ in the respiratory tract following viral infection may provide better neutralizing activities than those diffused solely from the blood following systemic immunization. In addition, persistent damage, inflammation, or chronic antigen deposition in the lung may further facilitate the development of local neutralizing antibody responses following natural infection.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
52,"Our study has several limitations. Due to the highly invasive nature of the BAL procedure, we were not able to recruit a large cohort of study participants. Furthermore, the study procedure made it challenging to time recruitment or perform a longitudinal analysis; rather it enabled a snapshot of vaccination or infection-induced mucosal immunity. Additionally, most of the participants were older and may not be representative of the entire vaccinated population, although this age group is considered as the primary targeting population for vaccination as they are at highest risk of infection associated with mortality and complications.

62,"Biological, 40589-V08H4), or nucleocapsid protein (N) (GenScript, Z03488) were precoated to 96-well plates overnight at 4°C. The following day, plates were washed with wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) and then blocked with Assay dilution buffer (Biolegend, 421203) for 1 hour at RT. Plasma or 20x concentrated BAL from unvaccinated donors, vaccinated and convalescents were diluted in ""Assay dilution buffer"" starting at a 1:5 or 1:1 dilution, respectively, and then serially diluted by a factor of 5. Plasma from mice were diluted starting at 1:100 dilution, and then serially diluted by a factor of 5. BAL from mice was not concentrated or diluted. Samples were added to the plate and incubated for 2 hours at RT. After washing three times with wash buffer, secondary antibodies diluted with ""Assay dilution buffer"" were added to the plate and then incubated for 1 hour at RT. Secondary antibodies including anti-human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, A6029), anti-human IgA (Hybridoma Reagent Laboratory, HP6123), anti-human IgM (Sigma Aldrich, A6907), anti-mouse IgG (SouthernBiotech,1030-05), anti-mouse IgA (SouthernBiotech, 1040-05), anti-mouse IgM (SouthernBiotech, 1020-05) were diluted as indicated respectively. Plates were washed three times and then developed with 3,3,5,5 tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 00-420156) for 10 min at RT. Sulfuric acid (2 M) was used as STOP buffer. Plates were read at about 5 min on a microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 450 nm with SoftMax Pro Software. The optical density (OD) value at 1:5 dilution for human plasma, 1:1 dilution for human BAL, 1:100 for mice plasma (1:500 for IgG), or original mice BAL and Nasal wash were displayed, respectively; one dot represents each individual.",1.0,,True

Briefly, in a 96-well format, plasma or BAL were diluted starting at a 1:40 or 1:20 dilution, respectively, and then serially diluted by a factor of 4. The pseudoviruses including D614G, Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron BA.1.1 were incubated with plasma or BAL for 1 hour at 37°C, followed by infection of 2x104 pre-seeded HEK293T-ACE2 cells (BEI, NR-52511) on a 96-well polystyrene tissue culture plate. Gaussia luciferase activity in cell culture media was assayed 48 hours and 72 hours after infection. Note that, to ensure valid comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 variants, equivalent amounts of pseudovirus were used based on the pre-determined virus titers and samples of different variants were loaded side by side in each plate. Neutralizing titer 50% (NT50) for each sample was determined by non-linear regression with least squares fit in GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software).",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS) was performed to detect vaccinespecific T cell response. Briefly, Cells were washed with FACS buffer and resuspended with complete RPMI with 10 mM HEPES supplemented with 10% FBS, 2-Mercaptoethanol, Sodium Pyruvate, Non-Essential Amino Acids, Pen-Strep, and L-Glutamine. Cells were then stimulated with 1 g/mL S peptide pool (JPT, PM-WCPV-S) for stimulation for 6 hours (PBMC for 16 hours). In the last 4 hours of incubation, protein transport inhibitor Brefeldin-A was added. Cells stimulated with PMA/Ionomycin or DMSO only were included as positive control and negative control, respectively. Following stimulation, cells were first stained for surface markers on ice for 30 min. After washing with PBS, cells were resuspended with Zombie-dye for viability staining and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 15 min. Following surface and viability staining, cells were fixed with fixation buffer (Biolegend, 420801) and permeabilized with perm/wash buffer (Biolegend, 421002), followed by intracellular cytokine staining on ice for 30 min. Cells were then washed with perm/wash buffer and resuspended with FACS buffer. To detect RBDspecific B cells, recombinant RBD proteins coupled with PE and APC were incubated with the cells for 30 min at 4°C. RBD-PE and RBD-APC double-positive B cells were identified as RBD+ B cells. To detect S539-546 epitope specific CD8+ T cells, SARS-CoV-2 S539-546 MHC class I tetramer (H-2Kb) (NIH Tetramer Core) was incubated with the cells for 30 min at 4°C. CD44+ Tetramer+ positive CD8+ T cells were identified as S539546 epitope specific CD8+ T cells. Cell population data were acquired on a multi-spectral flow cytometer Cytek Aurora (Cytek Biosciences) or Attune NxT (Thermo Fisher Science) and analyzed using FlowJo Software (10.8.1, Tree Star).
