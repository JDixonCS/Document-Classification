7,"Vaccination of the global population against COVID-19 is a great scientific, logistical, and moral challenge. Despite the rapid development and authorization of several full-length Spike (S) protein vaccines, the global demand outweighs the current supply and there is a need for safe, potent, high-volume, affordable vaccines that can fill this gap, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Whether SARS-CoV-2 S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)-based vaccines could fill this gap has been debated, especially with regards to its suitability to protect against emerging viral variants of concern. Given a predominance for elicitation of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that target RBD following natural infection or vaccination, a key biomarker of protection, there is merit for selection of RBD as a sole vaccine immunogen. With its high-yielding production and manufacturing potential, RBD-based vaccines offer an abundance of temperature-stable doses at an affordable cost. In addition, as the RBD preferentially focuses the immune response to potent and recently recognized cross-protective determinants, this domain may be central to the development of future pan-sarbecovirus vaccines. In this study, we review the data supporting the non-inferiority of RBD as a vaccine immunogen compared to full-length S-protein vaccines with respect to humoral and cellular immune responses against both the prototype pandemic SARS-CoV-2 isolate and emerging variants of concern.",1.0,COVID-19,True

10,"Unprecedented progress has been made in the design, development, production, and distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines to address the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVAX, a global initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines led by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, has delivered over 370 million doses to 144 countries and territories (https://www.unicef.org/supply/covid-19-vaccine-market-dashboard). Despite these remarkable achievements, there are serious challenges threatening the initial target delivery of 2 billion doses in 2021, such as raw material shortages, manufacturing delays, safety signals, the emergence of multiple viral variants of concern and interest (VOC/ VOI)1,2, and unequal procurement of vaccines by high-income countries. Ultimately, these challenges may result in a significant shortfall and delay in vaccine being made available to low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).",1.0,respiratory,True
11,"Most of the COVID-19 vaccines currently available or soon to be available to COVAX--including adenovirus-vectored, mRNA, and protein-subunit vaccines--use antigens based upon the SARSCoV-2 full-length Spike (S) protein. Figure 1 illustrates the S-protein in its trimeric prefusion conformation showing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on each protomer at the apex, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the conserved S2 stalk region3,4. Vaccine approaches using just the RBD region as an antigen have the advantage of focusing immunity to key protective determinants. As an immunogen, the RBD shares multiple positive attributes with the parental full-length S-protein (Table 1), as well as potential production and manufacturing advantages such as delivery of abundant5, temperature-stable6,7 vaccine doses at an affordable cost, critical factors for distributing vaccine to LMIC. Following several successful preclinical proof-of-",1.0,COVID-19,True
12,"concept studies, RBD candidates have been advanced into clinical testing utilizing multiple vaccine platforms (Table 2). With the potential for making billions of doses of RBD vaccines available, its manufacture at single-site production facilities by experienced developing country vaccine manufacturers (DCVM) will obviate the need for numerous tech-transfers and minimize the risk of delays. This will be especially important in case there is a need to update the vaccine based on epidemiological trends, as is the case for seasonal influenza vaccines.",1.0,clinical,True
13,"Available data are evaluated here from numerous preclinical and clinical studies, supporting the non-inferiority of RBD vaccine immunogens compared to full-length S-protein (Table 1), both with respect to eliciting homotypic and heterotypic crossneutralizing antibody (nAb) responses and cross-protection against emerging variants.",1.0,clinical,True
