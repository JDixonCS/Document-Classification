8,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The TMPRSS protein serves as a host co-receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 and is present in both prostate and lung tissue. This protein is known to be androgen regulated in the prostate, however, there is conflicting data on whether it is also androgen regulated in the lung, an important site for COVID-19 infection. Two randomized controlled trials have shown 5a-reductase inhibitors (5aRI) reduced the severity of COVID-19 symptoms in infected men, and reduced the likelihood of hospitalization. In the present study, we assessed the effect of 5aRI use on risk of community acquired COVID-19 infection.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
9,"METHODS: All men without prostate cancer included in an institutional prospective registry of all patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 8, 2020 and February 15, 2021 were included. Patients in the 5ARI cohort were matched at a 1:1 ratio to those not on 5ARI based on demographics and comorbidities that are known to increase the risk of infection. Exact matching was performed on race, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease and immune suppressive disease. The main outcome measures were the effect of 5aRI use on the rate of SARS-Cov-2 positivity and disease severity as measured by hospitalization, ICU admission, and death.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
10,"RESULTS: 60,474 males without prostate cancer diagnosis were initially selected, of which 1,079 were on 5ARI (1.8%). The matched cohorts included 1,075 on 5ARI and 1,075 non-5ARI, aged 21 to 99 years (Fig. 1). Of all the demographics and risk factors none were significantly different between the 5ARI groups in the matched cohorts. Risk for SARS-CoV-2 was significantly lower in the 5ARI group (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.97, p[0.024, Table). Multivariable logistic regression analysis based on the entire data before matching reached the same conclusion.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

15,INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Prostate cancer (PCa) patients on active surveillance (AS) may have concurrent lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic enlargement (BPE). Few studies have addressed LUTS in this population and guidelines are lacking on the management of LUTS for patients with PCa. The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of LUTS and rates of treatment among men with PCa on AS.,0.0,,False
16,"METHODS: Data are from the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study (PASS), a multicenter prospective cohort of men with PCa on AS. At enrollment and every 6 months thereafter data on medications and procedures for BPE were abstracted from medical records and assessments of LUTS via AUA symptom Score (AUASS) were completed. Men completed the enrollment and !1 post-enrollment AUASS and had a minimum of one year follow-up. Men who underwent bladder outlet procedures prior to enrollment or those with prostatitis at any follow-up visit were excluded. LUTS at enrollment were categorized as mild (AUASS 0-7), moderate (8-19) or severe (20-35). Rates of BPE treatments as well as PCa treatment were compared using univariable analyses.",0.0,,False
17,"RESULTS: A total of 1501 men were included in the study with a median follow-up of 6.4 (IQR 3.2,9.1) years. The median AUASS at enrollment was 7 (IQR 3,11). At enrollment, the prevalence of severe LUTS was 95 (6%), and 283 (19%) were receiving medical treatment for LUTS. A total of 22 (1.4%) men underwent BPE procedure during the study. Compared to men with mild LUTS, men with moderate or severe LUTS were more likely to receive BPE treatments; however even among patients with severe LUTS, only 4.2% underwent bladder outlet procedures. Men with worse LUTS were more likely to have more indolent prostate cancer (Gleason Grade group 1, p[0.03); and were less likely to undergo definitive treatment for PCa (p <0.01). Among men with severe LUTS that received definitive PCa treatment, the majority underwent radical prostatectomy.",0.0,,False
18,"CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PCa on AS with severe LUTS were more likely to harbor indolent PCa and had a low treatment rate for PCa. Although those with severe LUTS were more likely to receive bladder outlet procedures, only 4% of those patients actually did. Additional efforts are necessary to evaluate treatment paradigms for BPE in AS patients.",0.0,,False
