31,"40 Abstract: 41 Background: We assessed the performance of CoronaCHEK lateral flow assay on samples from 42 Uganda and Baltimore to determine the impact of geographic origin on assay performance. 43 Methods: Serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ individuals (Uganda: 78 samples from 78 44 individuals and Baltimore: 266 samples from 38 individuals) and from pre-pandemic individuals 45 (Uganda 1077 and Baltimore 532) were evaluated. Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated to 46 identify factors associated with a false-positive test. 47 Results: After first positive PCR in Ugandan samples the sensitivity was: 45% (95% CI 24,68) at 48 0-7 days; 79% (95%CI 64,91) 8-14 days; and 76% (95%CI 50,93) >15 days. In samples from 49 Baltimore, sensitivity was: 39% (95% CI 30, 49) 0-7 days; 86% (95% CI 79,92) 8-14 days; and 50 100% (95% CI 89,100) 15 days post positive PCR. The specificity of 96.5% (95% CI 97.5,95.2) in 51 Ugandan samples was significantly lower than samples from Baltimore 99.3% (95% CI 52 98.1,99.8), p<0.01. In Ugandan samples, individuals with a false positive result were more likely 53 to be male (PR 2.04, 95% CI 1.03,3.69) or individuals who had a fever more than a month prior 54 to sample acquisition (PR 2.87, 95% CI 1.12,7.35). 55 Conclusions: Sensitivity of the CoronaCHEK was similar in samples from Uganda and Baltimore. 56 The specificity was significantly lower in Ugandan samples than in Baltimore samples. False 57 positive results in Ugandan samples appear to correlate with a recent history of a febrile illness, 58 potentially indicative of a cross-reactive immune response in individuals from East Africa.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
