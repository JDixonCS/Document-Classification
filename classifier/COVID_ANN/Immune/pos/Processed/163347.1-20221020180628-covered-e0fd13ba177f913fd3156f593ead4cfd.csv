However, it remains unclear whether the enhanced innate immune responses are mediated by epigenetic regulation and, if so, whether these effects persist. Using mass cytometry, RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq, we show that BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination upregulated antiviral and IFN-stimulated gene expression in monocytes with greater effects after the second vaccination than those after the first vaccination. Transcription factor-binding motif analysis also revealed enriched IFN regulatory factors and PU.1 motifs in accessible chromatin regions. Importantly, although consecutive BNT162b2 mRNA vaccinations boosted innate immune responses and caused epigenetic changes in isolated monocytes, we showed that these effects occur only transiently and disappear 4 weeks after the second vaccination. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that a similar gene signature was impaired in the monocytes of unvaccinated COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. These results reinforce the importance of the innate immune response in the determination of COVID19 severity but indicate that, unlike adaptive immunity, innate immunity is not unexpectedly sustained even after consecutive vaccination. This study, which focuses on innate immmune memory, may provide novel insights into the vaccine development against infectious diseases.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

Over 40% of the world's population has been vaccinated against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as part of the effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the available vaccines, messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines that encode the SARSCoV-2 spike protein, including the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna), were among the first administered and have shown significant efficacy (1).",1.0,coronavirus,True

The boost in antibody production provided by revaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine and the long-term persistence of memory B- and T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 indicate the formation of adaptive immune memory (3, 5). Interestingly, the innate immune response is also reinforced after the second vaccination, as shown by an observed increase in the frequency of CD14+CD16+ monocytes and enhancement of the interferon (IFN)stimulated gene response in a myeloid cell cluster (CD14+BDCA1+PD-L1+ cells), which is a heterogeneous mix of classical monocytes, a classical dendritic cell (DC) subtype, and intermediate monocytes (5).

We observed robust induction of IFN-g and CXCL-10 in serum after the second vaccination compared to after the first vaccination (Supplemental Figure 2B).

We next classified monocytes into classical monocytes (cMono), intermediate monocytes (intMono), and nonclassical monocytes (ncMono) (Supplemental Figure 3D). The proportion of cMono was significantly more elevated after the second vaccination than after the first vaccination (Figure 1B).

37,"The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine induces transient epigenetic changes in monocytes To investigate whether the enhanced type I IFN signaling in monocytes observed after the second vaccination resulted from epigenetic reprogramming, we performed a transposaseaccessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) assay to assess genomewide chromatin accessibility (19). We were particularly interested in assessing whether any changes in monocyte persisted after the second vaccination. To perform this analysis, we isolated monocytes from the PBMCs obtained from five participants, including the four subjects for CyTOF and RNA-seq analysis, before and after each vaccination dose (D0, D1, D20, D22, and D49) (Figure 2A) and detected 1544, 1045, 1070, and 1473 differentially accessible regions (DARs) on D1, D20, D22, and D49 compared with D0, respectively (Figure 2B).

R848 is a ligand for Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR8, which mimics viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (such as single-stranded RNA, which is present during SARS-CoV-2 infection). After 24 h of stimulation, we measured the levels of secreted cytokines in culture supernatants using bead-based immunoassays (Figure 3A). In the culture supernatant, the level of IFN-a2, a type I IFN, was elevated to a greater extent at D20 and returned almost to baseline at D49 (Figure 3B).

55,"Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, it was hypothesized that long-term enhancement of the innate immune response, known as ""trained immunity,"" via the epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells after BCG vaccination may contribute to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity (32). In this study, ATAC-seq of monocytes showed increased accessibility of chromatin regions associated with ISG expression after the second vaccination, but these changes disappeared after only 4 weeks later. Thus, this observation may indicate innate immune cells displaying a form of ""short-term epigenetic memory"" (33, 34). In particular, we observed a transient enhancement of type I IFN responses after vaccinations.

Similarly to the effect observed during viral infection, the enhanced innate immune responses resulting from mRNA vaccination are associated with the production of neutralizing antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 (5). On the other hand, persistent type I IFN production may lead to failure to maintain higher antibody titers (39) or improper autoantibody production resulting in autoimmune disease (40). Although the enrichment analysis on the gene set in cluster 4 of ATAC-seq showed no significant pathways associated with immune responses, chromatin accessibility at the CXCL13 locus was still increased 28 days after the second vaccination, suggesting that the innate immune memory induced by mRNA vaccines may promote B cell maturation and antibody responses and help develop a rapid host defense against natural infection (41, 42). Taken together, these results indicate that the innate immunity induced by mRNA vaccines may not be directly involved in the long-term prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection but instead play an important role in driving adaptive immunity, including the production of antigen-specific antibodies.

In any event, type I IFN signaling is essential as a viral restriction mechanism; its successful response may help limit the occurence of other risk factors for severe COVID-19 such as cytokine storm (49). Interestingly, the gene set downregulated in patients with COVID-19 with ARDS was similar to the gene set strongly induced in monocytes by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine; this means that the innate immune responses induced by mRNA vaccines may compensate for the decreased IFN responses in patients with severe COVID-19. Therefore, to ensure the prevention of severe COVID-19 after a second or third vaccination dose, activating and sustaining innate immune responses, including the IFN response, may be important.

Second, all participants were male and sex was therefore not considered in our study.

Additionally, the IFN-a2 plasma levels induecd by BNT162b2 are likely higher in females than in males (5). Further investigations are warranted to understand the impact of these differences in immune responses between females and males on epigenetic reprogramming in innate immune cells. Third, this study was a short-term observation, extending 49 days after the first immunization. It has been reported that the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection gradually decreases after the second vaccination (53) and that a third dose of mRNA vaccine improves the protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 due to enhanced adaptive immune responses (54, 55). However, it is unclear how the epigenomics of the innate immune system changes during subsequent vaccination and whether this contributes to the booster effect; therefore, further longitudinal observation will be needed.
