10,"Abstract An efficient host immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-­CoV-­2, COVID-­19) appears to be crucial for controlling and resolving this viral infection. However, many studies have reported autoimmune characteristics in severe COVID-1­ 9 patients. Moreover, clinical observations have revealed that COVID-1­ 9-­associated acute distress respiratory syndrome shares many features in common with inflammatory myopathy including interstitial lung disease (ILD), most particularly rapidly progressive (RP)-I­LD. This study explored this phenomenon by seeking to identify and characterize myositis-­ specific and related autoantibodies in 25 COVID-­19 patients with mild or severe symptoms. Line blot analysis with the EUROLINE Myopathies Ag kit identified 9 (36%) patients with COVID-­19 with one or more autoantibodies against several myositis-­related antigens (Jo-1­ , Ku, Mi-2­ , PL-7­ , PL-­12, PM-­Scl 75, PM-­ Scl 100, Ro-­52, and SRP); no anti-­MDA5 antibodies were detected. As the presence of antibodies identified by line blots was unrelated to disease severity, we further characterized the autoantibodies by radioimmunoassay, in which [35S] methionine-l­abeled K562 cellular antigens were precipitated and visualized by gel electrophoresis. This result was confirmed by an immunoprecipitation assay and immunoblotting; 2 patients exhibited anti-K­ u70 and anti-K­ u80 antibodies.",1.0,respiratory,True

18,"Study Highlights WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC? SARS-­COV-­2 infection leads to excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, abnormal induction of autoantibodies, and acute distress respiratory syndrome in severe cases. These clinical features are also a clinical phenomenon of interstitial lung disease, which causes morbidity and mortality in patients with inflammatory myopathy. WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS? We determined whether COVID-1­ 9 patients have myositis-s­pecific and related autoantibodies and how levels of these autoantibodies may reflect the severity of SARS-­CoV-­2-­induced lung injury. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE? The combination of line blot assay, radioimmunoassay, and immunoprecipitation assay investigations provides accurate autoantibody data. As line blot identification of myositis-­related autoantibodies was unrelated to disease severity, radioimmunoassay and immunoprecipitation assay data characterized anti-K­ u70 and anti-­Ku80 autoantibodies in COVID-­19 patients. HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRAN­ SLATIONAL SCIENCE? Our data suggest that it is necessary to carefully evaluate the presence of autoantibodies in people recovered after COVID-­19 in order to avoid misinterpreting those autoantibodies as diagnostic markers for autoimmune diseases.",1.0,respiratory,True

20,"Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped, positive-­stranded RNA viruses that infect humans and animals and cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, or neurological diseases. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-C­ oV-2­ , COVID-­19) disease has been a pandemic since December 2019. At the time of writing this article, COVID-­19-r­elated deaths worldwide had reached 5.5 million.1 An efficient host immune response involving innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-­CoV-­2 appears to be crucial for controlling and resolving this viral infection. Notably, the severity of COVID-­19 may be associated with the excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines leading to a ""cytokine storm"" and subsequent acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).2,3 A variety of autoimmune characteristics have been observed in cases of severe COVID-­19, with the findings of lymphocytopenia (85.7%), elevated levels of C-r­eactive protein (94.7%), and interleukin-6­ (89.5%), as well as anti-5­ 2kDa SSA/Ro (Ro-5­ 2) antibodies (20%), anti-­ 60kDa SSA/Ro (Ro-6­ 0) antibodies (25%), and antinuclear antibodies (50%).4",1.0,Coronavirus,True

The signal of each antigen was identified with the correct molecular weight using sera from patients with RP-­ILD (Figure 1), which is consistent with previously published data. One or more specific protein bands in each lane of ILD patients served as positive controls to demonstrate the presence of the specific autoantibody against each Ag (Figure 1; the solid arrowheads indicate specific antigens). We subsequently tested all positive samples identified by the EUROIMMUN kit, as shown in Figure 1. In contrast to the data from the previous screening, we could not detect any obviously positive signals in sera from patients with COVID-1­ 9 (Figure 1). Only two samples, COVID-­19-6­ and COVID-­19-2­0 (Figure 1a; lanes 3 and 5 and Figure 1b; lanes 1 and 3), with the empty arrowhead in Figure 1, displayed a background similar to that of RP-­ILD patients (ILD-­PL-­7 and ILD-K­ u) with both anti-­PL-­7 (Figure 1a; lane 6 and Figure 1b; lane 4) and anti­Ku (Figure 1a; lane 7 and Figure 1b; lane 5) autoantibodies.

Using immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting revealed two patients (#6 and #20) with anti-K­ u or anti-P­L-­7 antibodies, who had previously displayed the same antibodies. Immunoblots (Figure 2a,b) identified anti-K­ u70 and anti-­Ku80 antibodies in both patients. In contrast, we did not observe anti-­PL-­7 antibodies (Figure 2c).

We therefore screened for the presence of these myositis-r­ elated autoantibodies in order to understand whether or not they are involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-­19 or serve as prognostic markers for these patients. Consistent with a previous publication that used dot blot analysis,4 we identified myositis-r­elated autoantibodies anti-R­ o 52 and anti-­ Jo-1­. We also found other autoantibodies, including anti-­Ku, anti-­Mi-­2, anti-­PL-­7, anti-­PL-­12, anti-­PM-­Scl 75, anti-P­ M-­Scl 100, and anti-S­ RP antibodies and 36% of the patients in our cohort had one or more myositis-­ related autoantibodies identified by line blots with the EUROLINE Myopathies Ag kit. However, none of these autoantibodies was related to disease severity. We therefore decided to further characterize the pattern of autoantigens. After analyzing these antibodies by radioimmunoassay and immunoprecipitation assay, we discovered that the results were inconsistent between the line blot analysis and radioimmunoassay findings. The molecular patterns suggested that some autoantibodies did not reflect the correct molecular weight, which implies that these antibodies may not target myositis-­ related antigens. Previous studies have revealed the",1.0,disease,True

628,"There is growing evidence that antibody-m­ ediated immunity has a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune-­related ILD.5,14,15 Although the causal relationship between autoantibodies and ILD remains to be clarified, our research group and others have shown that myositis-r­elated autoantibodies are highly associated with ILD, particularly RP-­ILD.5,11,14-­16 Other studies have also shown that SARS-­CoV-2­ infection can trigger autoimmune responses,4,25 which may not only relate to COVID-­19-a­ ssociated mortality but may also shape immune regulation to an autoimmune disease-­prone status. As depicted in Figure 1, the normal controls have a clear background without autoantibodies, whereas COVID-­19 patients developed many autoantibodies against different cellular antigens that are very similar to those in autoimmune RP-I­LD patients, who have a strong background of high-l­evel autoantibodies.

633,"The assessment of both anti-a­minoacyl-­tRNA synthetase and anti-­MDA5 autoantibodies is useful for predicting the clinical course and prognosis of DM/DM-­ILD patients.30 Anti-­aminoacyl-­tRNA synthetase antibodies, including anti-­Jo-­1, anti-­PL-­7, anti-­PL-­12, anti-­EJ, and anti-­OJ antibodies, are associated with a wide spectrum of autoimmune diseases, including myositis and ILD.30 Moreover, anti-­aminoacyl-­tRNA synthetase antibodies are associated with a better prognosis in DM/DM-­ILD patients,31,32 whereas anti-­MDA5 antibodies are associated with a poorer prognosis in these patients.33 Despite some evidence demonstrating the presence of anti-­ MDA5 antibodies in patients infected with SARS-­CoV-­2, very few reports have suggested a possible pathological role of anti-M­ DA5 antibodies during this infection.34 However, as we show in Table 1, no positive patients in our cohort were found to have anti-M­ DA5 antibodies. In contrast, some patients presented with anti-K­ u70 and anti-K­ u80 autoantibodies. The genetic background of our Hispanic and Caucasian cohort may mean that these patients rarely have the human leukocyte antigens (HLA) DRB1*0101/*0405 and DRB1*0401/*12:02, which are found in the Han Chinese and Japanese and are highly associated with the presence of anti-­MDA5 antibodies.35,36 This genetic difference may explain the absence of anti-­MDA5 antibodies in our report, although Wang et al.34 have reported finding that 48.2% (132/274) of COVID-­19 patients in China presented with anti-M­ DA5 autoantibodies, identified by immunoprecipitation and enzyme-­linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Isotope-­labeled protein immunoprecipitation with serum or plasma is the gold standard, showing high sensitivity for determining the existence of an autoantibody. Differences in genetic backgrounds and methodologies might explain this controversial finding. In this study, we have evaluated the presence of myositis-­related antibodies, anti-K­ u70 and anti-­Ku80, using multiple methods to confirm whether these antibodies contribute to the prognosis of COVID-­19 patients. Several reports have suggested the presence of autoantibodies in COVID-­19 patients,25,26,37,38 but have lacked further confirmation by either radioimmunoassay or immunoprecipitation assay. On the strength of our study results, we recommend that investigations into these autoantibodies are revised, using the gold standard method of radioimmunoassay.",1.0,clinical,True
