21,"Reports from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Brazil have highlighted racial disparities in the COVID-19 pandemic.1-4 National studies from the UK and Brazil have found race to be an independent predictor of death.3,4 In the United States, Black and Hispanic individuals have disproportionately high rates of infection, hospitalization, and mortality.1,2,5,6 These disparities have been attributed to greater representation of Black and Hispanic persons in essential services, and a higher burden of comorbidities in minority communities, among others.",1.0,COVID-19,True
22,"While Black and Hispanic individuals in the US have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, the majority of published studies investigating COVID-19 mortality risk factors have been in cohorts of individuals with predominantly European or Asian ancestry.7-11 Few US studies have directly examined mortality risk factors and their effect sizes in Black or Hispanic compared to White individuals.1,12 Rigorous analysis to establish risk factors and molecular predictors for each population is urgently needed.",1.0,pandemic,True
23,"We sought to identify race/ethnic-specific clinical and immune factors of mortality using a diverse cohort of White, Black, and Hispanic COVID-19 patients admitted to a single health system in New York. In addition to baseline characterization, we conducted stratified and interaction term analyses to identify risk and immune factors that may affect outcomes of each patient population.
