21,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, immune-mediated rheumatologic disease (IMRD), with a two to five-fold higher mortality rate than the general population1,2 and with infectious complications being responsible for 25%-50% of deaths.3 The higher risk of infection can be explained by impairment of the immune system, which is inherent to the disease, due to glucocorticoid and immunosuppressant use, and accumulated damage.3,4 Infections are predominantly bacterial in origin in the community, but there is also an increased risk of fungal, viral, and mycobacterial infections.5-7",1.0,disease,True
22,"Since the first cases were described, severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a pandemic, reaching more than 200 countries. Conditions such as systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease have been identified as the main risk factors for infection and worse outcomes.8 Initial studies suggested that autoimmune diseases are not risk factors for COVID-19.8,9 However, a systematic review published in 2020 reported a higher prevalence of the disease in IMRD, but not in the subgroup of SLE patients.10 A recent study reported a worse COVID-19 prognosis in IMRD patients, with higher intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality rates.11 The first evaluation of the ReumaCoV-Brazil Registry with 334 IMRD participants",1.0,case,True

205,"Cyclophosphamide treatment in patients with SLE is associated with an increased risk of bacterial and nonbacterial infection, impacting the disease morbidity and mortality.29 In the present study, cyclophosphamide significantly increased hospital admission among patients with COVID-19. Poor control of viral infection by the immune system is one of the main factors contributing to COVID-19 severity, as demonstrated by the association between high viral replication and immune dysregulation.30 Cyclophosphamide is a cytotoxic alkylating medication that interferes with lymphocyte proliferation, reducing the production of effector and cytotoxic T cells, as well as autoantibody production.31 The response of cytotoxic T lymphocytes is crucial for viral eradication in COVID-19. Patients with severe forms of COVID-19 present with perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and the depletion of almost all T-cell subtypes.30 SARS-CoV-2 infection presents with clonal expansion of plasma cells, producing specific neutralizing antibodies due to multifaceted B-cell activation.30 Cyclophosphamide reduces antibody production, thus also interfering with the humoral response to the virus.31 The COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance also observed worse outcomes in patients with SLE and COVID-19 who were on cyclophosphamide treatment.32",1.0,disease,True

208,"Hypertension is considered a comorbidity associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes.8,36,37 An Italian study evaluated the death certificates of 4691 patients who died because of SARS-CoV-2 infection, showing that hypertension was the most reported comorbidity.38 The prevalence of hypertension in SLE ranges from 9.4% to 77% in several cohorts, depending on the definition used and age group of the studied population. Renal damage secondary to nephritis and glucocorticoid treatment are important causes of hypertension in SLE; however, other mechanisms have been described, such as generalized endothelial dysfunction. Recent studies have also reinforced the role of immune system dysregulation and chronic inflammation in the development and maintenance of hypertension.39 Increased serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interleukin-6, were shown to be associated with hypertension.39 Therefore, endothelial dysfunction and immune dysregulation caused by COVID-19 may further intensify the immune imbalance of hypertensive patients with SLE. Aggressive screening and low blood pressure level thresholds for antihypertensive treatment are usual recommendations for SLE patient care, which should be strongly emphasized in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.40",1.0,COVID-19,True

This outcome should be carefully analyzed, as the variable encompasses different medications with variable half-life and partial or complete discontinuation. The interference from treatment discontinuation in the immune response to infection could occur either through the reactivation of SLE or by unblocking the specific medication pathway with the release of inflammatory cytokines. Several anti-rheumatic drugs have been involved in the COVID-19 approach, such as tocilizumab in the management of severe forms, antiTNF showing a protective effect, and rituximab associated with a worse prognosis.41 There is much evidence of a nonprotective role of chronic hydroxychloroquine use concerning the severity of COVID-19 in patients with IMRDs.42 Large and longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the influence of both maintenance and",1.0,COVID-19,True

Cyclophosphamide pulse therapy and a history of hypertension were associated with a higher frequency of hospital admission related to COVID-19. Telemedicine was a useful strategy in these SLE patients. There are still many questions about the influence of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the progression of SLE patients, which can be better answered by longitudinal evaluations. It is also an important goal to characterize immunological deficiencies secondary to SLE, the medications used for SLE treatment, and its comorbidities, which may impair the efficiency of immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.
