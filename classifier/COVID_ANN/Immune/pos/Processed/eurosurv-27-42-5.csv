7,"Background: Countries worldwide are focusing to mitigate the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by employing public health measures. Laboratories have a key role in the control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Serology for SARS-CoV-2 is of critical importance to support diagnosis, define the epidemiological framework and evaluate immune responses to natural infection and vaccine administration. Aim: The aim of this study was the assessment of the actual capability among laboratories involved in sero-epidemiological studies on COVID-19 in EU/EEA and EU enlargement countries to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies through an external quality assessment (EQA) based on proficiency testing. Methods: The EQA panels were composed of eight different, pooled human serum samples (all collected in 2020 before the vaccine roll-out), addressing sensitivity and specificity of detection. The panels and two EU human SARS-CoV-2 serological standards were sent to 56 laboratories in 30 countries. Results: The overall performance of laboratories within this EQA indicated a robust ability to establish past SARS-CoV-2 infections via detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, with 53 of 55 laboratories using at least one test that characterised all EQA samples correctly. IgM-specific test methods provided most incorrect sample characterisations (24/208), while test methods detecting total immunoglobulin (0/119) and neutralising antibodies (2/230) performed the best. The semiquantitative assays used by the EQA participants also showed a robust performance in relation to the standards. Conclusion: Our EQA showed a high capability across",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

10,"What did you want to address in this study? Robust serological test systems to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human serum samples are important to establish whether past infections occurred and to assess the extent of immunity in the population. We want to enable laboratories and countries employing public health measures to assess the quality and robustness of different serological tests that are being used in European expert laboratories. What have we learnt from this study? The majority of laboratories (53 of 55) used at least one serological test that was able to characterise all the serum samples correctly. The performance of serological assays varied for different types of antibodies. What are the implications of your findings for public health? Our study showed a high capability across European reference laboratories for reliable diagnostics for SARSCoV-2 antibody responses. Aside from assessing the total share of people with immunity in the population, reliable serological diagnostics are also important to guide public health actions by helping to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic cases.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

14,"Countries worldwide are focusing to mitigate the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic [1] by employing public health measures, including increasing vaccination roll-out and restriction of movements. Laboratories have a key role in the control of the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by detecting acute and previous infections with the virus in a reliable and timely fashion. While the detection of acute infections, typically done by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) or antigen (Ag) testing, can be used to stop transmission chains through isolation and quarantine measures [2], the detection of immunological markers for past SARS-CoV-2 infections and/or vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 is used to estimate immunity [3] in both individuals and communities, thereby informing mitigation strategies. Most serological assays detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as the main immunological marker. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the spike protein represents one of the main concerns for the potential of immunological escape from the antibodies response.",1.0,coronavirus,True
15,"The vast impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public health, economies and societies drives the rapid development of numerous serological assays by laboratories and commercial entities [4]. These tests are not only based on different techniques, e.g. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA), lateral flow assays (LFA) and virus neutralisation tests (VNT), but also use different antigenic targets and are able to detect different types of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, e.g. total immunoglobulin (Ig), IgG, IgM, IgA and/or neutralising antibodies. Besides the fact that each laboratory needs to perform validation and evaluation studies before implementing a new test [5], it is crucial to assess the capability of the laboratory to perform the test through an external quality assessment (EQA) based on proficiency testing. Proficiency testing enables a comparison of the accuracy of different tests and the performance of different laboratories based on the same material [6-10].",1.0,COVID-19,True

681,"used at least one assay that identified all samples correctly as SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive or negative. IgM-specific assays showed the most incorrect characterisations of the EQA samples. In particular, sample G (IgA+/IgG+/IgM+(low)) was missed by four of five laboratories that used the same commercial IgM-only assay (Euroimmun - Anti-SARS-CoV-2 NCP ELISA IgM) and by two additional assays that should have been able to detect the presence of IgM antibodies based on their technical specifications (AAZ - COVID-PRESTO TROD IgG/IgM; Hangzhou Biotest Biotech - RightSign COVID19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette). The remaining 20 laboratories were able to identify sample G correctly using 11 different assays. Indeed, this sample was characterised by the two reference laboratories to have IgM levels below the detection limit of some assays (find the detailed results listed in Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, eight of 14 IgM-specific assays resulted in one or more false-positive test results. Several studies have shown that in general, IgM assays have a lower sensitivity and specificity than IgG or total IgG assays [14-16]. Hence it is recommended to perform serodiagnostics on multiple isotypes simultaneously to improve the specifics of the overall diagnosis. In addition, although specific IgM antibodies can be detected as early as 4 days after infection and they can help to define the early antibody response, SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger unconventional antibody responses, with cases developing IgG before IgM or others with no IgM [17-19]. Indeed, the majority of laboratories (45/55) used more than one serological test to assess the samples. In case of result discrepancies between IgMspecific tests and tests detecting other types of immunoglobulins, laboratories should consider the timing of a potential infection, but also the higher unreliability of IgM-specific tests. Overall, test methods detecting total immunoglobulin, neutralising antibodies or IgG performed better than test methods that are IgA- or IgM-specific. Test method performance was different neither for commercial and in-house assays, nor for a specific test principle, e.g. ELISA, (s)VNT, PRNT or CLIA/ CMIA/ECLIA. This was also shown by the variety of test methods that characterised 100.0% of tested samples correctly (Table 3).",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
682,"Correct characterisation of the three specificity samples (C, E and F) was more problematic than of the sensitivity samples. Variable test performance for specificity samples has been reported before [20,21]. A likely explanation is potential cross-reactivity with antibodies raised by previous infection with other human coronaviruses causing the common cold [13], as all samples in the proficiency panel of this EQA also contained antibodies against all other seasonally circulating human coronaviruses (Supplementary Table S1). If this was the case, specificity test performance would probably be further reduced in periods of high prevalence of co-circulating seasonal coronaviruses.",1.0,coronavirus,True

A recent European study showed that indeed a substantial heterogeneity exists in neutralising antibody testing approaches, resulting in almost 100-fold differences in raw neutralising titres. However, a direct comparison was possible through harmonisation by the use of a standard defined in IU/mL, which reduced the inter-laboratory variability ca 10-fold [22]. Another study showed that the inter-laboratory variation for neutralisation tests was reduced more than 50-fold when assay outcomes were reported relative to the same (WHO) standard [23]. In our study, the results of the VNT could not be compared through normalisation as the JRC standards were defined with a titre range for neutralisation tests and not with a defined IU/mL as in the WHO standard [24].",1.0,infectious,True

For future sero-epidemiological surveillance studies, the capacity of serological tests to differentiate between antibodies derived from natural infections and antibodies induced by vaccination is desirable. This can be achieved by using serological tests with different antigenic targets, i.e. anti-N (natural infection only) and anti-S detection, to determine the level of natural immunity in the study population and assess the risk of vaccination not being sufficient to protect against a potentially increasing burden on the healthcare system.

693,"A general capability for reliable, harmonised and standardised characterisation of the main immunological markers of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is crucial to increase the overall utility of serology testing. Potential inconsistent test performance and the absence of a rationale to use quantitative antibody assays due to the, yet, undetermined correlates of protection of antibody levels, currently limits the overall usefulness of serology. Participation in EQAs may help to improve implementation of diagnostic tests. Our EQA showed a high capability across European reference laboratories for reliable diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. Serological tests that provide robust and reliable detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are available. However, the use of standards is necessary for meaningful quantitative measurements to increase the overall use of serology testing, including the evaluation of antibody waning and possible reactivity against more relevant virus variants with immunological escape potential in the prospective of a more `personalised' approach to vaccination strategies. This is particularly relevant given that serology is no longer restricted to reference laboratories. Numerous laboratories non specialised in microbiology are performing serological tests using a wide panel of commercial assays. In order to maintain serological test quality, it would also be advisable to implement EQAs at national level, including schemes to evaluate and distinguish natural immunity and vaccination response.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
