19,"Abstract Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is associated with immunocompromise and high risk of severe COVID-19 disease and mortality. Monoclonal B-Lymphocytosis (MBL) patients also have immune impairment. We evaluated humoral and cellular immune responses in 181 patients with CLL (160) and MBL (21) to correlate failed seroconversion (<50AU/mL SARSCoV-2 II IgG assay, antibody to spike protein, Abbott Diagnostics) following each of 2 vaccine doses with clinical and laboratory parameters. Following first and second doses, 79.2% then 45% of CLL, and 50% then 9.5% of MBL respectively remained seronegative, indicating 2 vaccine doses are crucial. There was significant association between post-dose 2 antibody level with pre-vaccination reduced IgM (p<0.0001), IgG2 (p<0.035), IgG3 (p<0.046), and CLL therapy within 12 months (p<0.001) in univariate analysis. By multivariate analysis, reduced IgM (p<0.0002) and active therapy (p<0.0002) retained significance. There was no significant correlation with age, gender, CLL duration, IgG, IgA or lymphocyte subsets. Anti-spike protein levels varied widely and were lower in CLL, than MBL, and both lower than normal donors. Neutralization activity showed anti-spike levels <1000AU/mL were usually negative for both an early viral clade and the contemporary Delta variant. There were 72.9% of CLL and 53.3% of MBL who failed to reach anti-spike levels >1000AU/mL. In a representative subset of 32 CLL patients, 80% had normal T-cell responses by IFN and IL-2 FluoroSpot assay. Failed seroconversion occurred in 36.6%% of treatment-naive patients, 52.9% treatment-naive with reduced IgM, 78.1% on therapy, and 85.7% on ibrutinib.

It will be important to establish which elements of the immune system best predict Covid-19 protection as many appear to have an intact T-cell response. In any event, the standard precaution measures of masks, hand hygiene, social distancing, and vaccination of close family, friends and contacts will remain important and every CLL patient should remain conscious of these relatively simple precautions.
