17,"76 Introduction 77 COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV78 2), has resulted in massive morbidity and mortality worldwide (1, 2). Acute infection is 79 associated in some subjects with pneumonia and marked hypoxia, leading to acute 80 respiratory distress syndrome as well as other life-threatening complications (3-5). This 81 inflammation critically involves a dysregulated immune response characterized by intense 82 activation of innate and adaptive immunity associated with features of a cytokine storm 83 (6, 7). While most patients recover from this acute infection, a subset develops persistent 84 symptoms related to different organ system dysfunction including the respiratory, 85 cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, and central nervous systems (8). 86 A special case in point is the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. While most 87 children remain asymptomatic or develop mild infection, some develop a multi-system 88 inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) approximately one month after initial infection 89 (9-13). These patients exhibit severe immune dysregulation characterized by intense 90 cytokine production and lymphocyte activation associated with fever and end-organ 91 dysfunction including mucocutaneous, cardiovascular, hematologic, and especially 92 gastrointestinal systems (14-21). IFNg has been identified as a key cytokine in MIS-C with 93 increased levels associated with disease severity and organ system involvement (22-25). 94 The patients also exhibit robust T cells activation with T cell receptor repertoire skewing 95 (24-29). There are defining characteristics of MIS-C that remain perplexing, including the 96 substantial delay between the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C (9, 10, 12). Unlike 97 children with acute COVID-19 pneumonia, most patients with MIS-C are previously 98 healthy and are able to mount a robust immune response to SARS-CoV-2 with",1.0,COVID-19,True
18,"99 neutralizing antibodies to the virus (11, 18, 30). This constellation of features in MIS-C 100 suggests that an evolving hyperinflammatory immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is part 101 of the pathophysiology of this syndrome. Indeed, studies based on relatively small 102 number of patients suggest that a genetic predisposition may contribute to the immune 103 dysregulation in MIS-C (31, 32). 104 Notch signaling pathways have emerged as important regulators of the immune system 105 by influencing both Treg and Tconv cells responses (33, 34). In mammals, the Notch 106 family is composed by 4 Notch receptors (Notch1-4) and 5 ligands (Delta-like1, 3, and 4 107 and Jagged1 and 2) (35). Recent studies have outlined a prominent role for NOTCH4 in 108 the immune dysregulation in acute COVID19 and related respiratory viral illnesses (36). 109 Notch4 is upregulated on lung tissue Treg cells in an IL-6-dependent manner to subvert 110 their tissue repair function in favor of an inflammatory response (36-39). The NOTCH4 111 locus is associated with critical illness in COVID-19 (40). However, the immune 112 dysregulatory mechanisms operative in post-acute COVID19 syndromes including MIS113 C remain unclear. 114 In this study, we show that MIS-C patients exhibit robust T cells activation in association 115 with increased Notch signaling in Treg cells. In particular, while NOTCH4 is also 116 upregulated on circulating Treg cells of children with acute COVID19 as a function of 117 disease severity, the Treg cells in MIS-C additionally upregulate NOTCH1 expression, a 118 pathway previously implicated in T helper cell type 1 (Th1)-skewed immune 119 dysregulation, autoimmunity, graft versus host disease and solid organ rejection (41, 42). 120 Gene enrichment using whole genome/exome sequence analysis employing Fisher 121 testing and Monte-Carlo simulation revealed the enrichment in MIS-C patients of rare",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
19,"122 mutations impacting pathways of inflammation and autoimmunity, many of which 123 contained Notch-related genes. Consistent with these results, loss of function mutations 124 were identified in the negative NOTCH1 regulators NUMB and NUMBL (43). In vitro 125 experiment revealed that this loss of function mutations promotes Notch1 expression. 126 Moreover, in mice either expressing an active form of Notch1 in Treg cells 127 (Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+) or lacking NUMB expression in these cells (Foxp3EGFPCreNumb/), 128 treatment with Poly I:C to simulate viral infection induced systemic inflammation. Notch1 129 signaling in Treg cells induced the B cell inhibitory receptor CD22 (44, 45), which 130 promoted systemic inflammation in association with the expression of the a4b7 gut 131 homing receptor. CD22 destabilized Treg cells and impaired their suppressive function in 132 an mTORC1-dependent manner. Treatment of Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ or 133 Foxp3EGFPCreNumb/ mice with an anti-CD22 mAb suppressed the development of 134 systemic inflammation following Poly I:C treatment by restoring the Treg cells suppressive 135 function. These findings point to the mobilization of Treg cell-specific tissue inflammatory 136 licensing modules involving different Notch receptors that is operative in MIS-C and point 137 to interventions along the Notch1-CD22 axis as therapeutic strategy in MIS-C. 138",1.0,negative,True
20,"139 Results 140 Increased CD4+ T cell activation and Treg cell destabilization in MIS-C. To elucidate 141 the immune dysregulatory mechanisms operative in MIS-C, we studied an international 142 cohort of 45 children with MIS-C and 50 children with COVID-19 from centers in the United 143 States, Italy and Turkey (Table S1 and Patient Cohorts section in Methods). For 144 comparison, 5 children with Kawasaki disease (KD), 12 adults with COVID-19, and 18 145 pediatric healthy controls were also evaluated. All MIS-C patients met the Centers for 146 Disease Control (CDC) Case Definition for MIS-C (46), while 93% fulfilled the WHO case 147 definition (47-49). Fever was universal in MIS-C patients and rash (49%), conjunctivitis 148 (58%), and GI symptoms (96%) were also common. Children with MIS-C were highly 149 inflamed (median CRP 16.0 mg/dL, IQR 7.8-24.0), lymphopenic (median absolute 150 lymphocyte count 0.91 x103/mL, IQR 0.53-1.35) and coagulopathic (median D-dimer 3.1 151 mcg/mL, IQR 1.5-6.2). Over 90% of MIS-C patients demonstrated positive SARS-CoV-2 152 serologies. 18/45 (40%) were considered to have severe MIS-C defined by admission to 153 the intensive care unit (ICU), need for vasopressor support, and/or development of 154 coronary artery aneurysms. The demographics and key clinical findings in the respective 155 patient groups are delineated in Table S1. 156 To further delineate the CD4+ T cell dynamics in MIS-C, we carried out single-cell RNA 157 sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on CD4+ T cells from the peripheral blood of four 158 healthy controls, three MIS-C patients sampled prior to treatment and another five MIS-C 159 patients sampled post-treatment. We first mapped our transcriptomic data to a reference 160 human PBMC dataset using Azimuth (50), thereby delineating 6 subsets of CD4+ T cells 161 (Fig. 1 A and B). We further performed a graph-based clustering analysis using Seurat,",1.0,COVID-19,True
21,"162 which uncovered 16 clusters. Eight of these clusters (Clusters 1 to 8) were enriched in 163 cells annotated as CD4 naïve by Azimuth and expressing genes associated with a naïve 164 CD4+ T cell profile (e.g., CCR7 and SELL), 5 (Clusters 10 to 14) were enriched in 165 activated CD4+ T cells (CD69), including one with high NF-kB signaling (Cluster 10; 166 NFKB1). The final 3 clusters encompassed a mix of naïve and activated cells, including 167 one cluster delineated by viral sensing gene transcripts (Cluster 9; IFIT2, IFIT3), one 168 cluster enriched in Treg cell transcripts (Cluster 15; FOXP3) and another with mitotic cells 169 (Cluster 16; TRBC1) (Fig. S1A-F). Prior to treatment, MIS-C patients exhibited prominent 170 expansion of cluster 10, enclosing both cells annotated as Tconv and Treg cells by 171 Azimuth. Cluster 10 was characterized by increased NFKB1 expression, and NF-kB 172 signaling and contracted following immunomodulatory therapy (Fig. S1A-F). 173 To further decipher differences in CD4+ T cell transcriptomic programs between patient 174 groups, we also performed pseudobulk differential analysis (DEA) with a focus on both 175 Treg (cells found in Cluster 15 or delineated as Treg cells by Azimuth) and Tconv cells 176 (cells found in clusters 9 to 14 and delineated as activated Tconv by Azimuth). We 177 aggregated gene expression data at the patient level for Treg cells and activated Tconv, 178 and performed pairwise comparisons of MIS-C pre-treatment, post-treatment and control 179 groups using DESeq2. The DEA were followed by gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) 180 against the MSigDB Hallmark collection and using the ranked log2 fold changes as input, 181 which reinforced our prior observations of NF-kB pathway activation in pre-treatment MIS182 C samples, not only in Tconv but also in Treg cells (Fig. 1 C-H and Fig S1G-H ). Pathways 183 that were up regulated in the MIS-C pre-treatment group included mTORC1, whose 184 hyperactivity has been previously noted to mediate Treg cell destabilization (Fig. 1 C-H",1.0,cluster,True
22,"185 and Fig S1G-H) (51, 52). These results indicated that MIS-C is associated with enhanced 186 Tconv activation and Treg dysregulation. 187 Increased NOTCH1 expression on CD4+ Treg and Tconv cells in MIS-C. Previous 188 studies have demonstrated a key role for Notch signaling-mediated Treg cell 189 dysregulation in licensing tissue inflammation (36, 38, 41, 42). For example, NOTCH4 is 190 upregulated in lung tissue Treg cells during SARS-CoV2 and influenza infections, leading 191 to enhanced tissue inflammation and disease severity (36). We analyzed the expression 192 of different Notch receptors on CD4+ Treg and Tconv cells in pediatric subjects with mild 193 and severe COVID19 and those with MIS-C. As comparison groups we included healthy 194 children, adults with severe COVID19 and children with KD, some of whose clinical 195 features overlap with those of MIS-C (16, 31, 48, 49). There was marked increase in 196 NOTCH1 expression on both Treg and Tconv cells of patients with MIS-C but not on those 197 of other subject groups (Fig. 2A-C, Fig S2A). NOTCH4 expression was also selectively 198 increased on the circulating Treg cells of adult and pediatric subjects with severe COVID199 19 and with MIS-C but not on their Tconv cells. NOTCH4 was also not upregulated on 200 Treg cells of patients with mild COVID19 or with KD (Fig. 2D-F, Fig S2B). NOTCH1 201 expression in MISC was associated with increased intracellular expression of NOTCH1 202 cytoplasmic domain (N1c) in Treg cell (Fig. 2G). In contrast, NOTCH2 expression was 203 increased on NOTCH1+ Treg and Tconv cells of MIS-C subjects albeit at a lower 204 magnitude than that of NOTCH1, while there was no difference in the NOTCH2 single 205 positive Treg and Tconv cell populations between MIS-C and healthy controls (Fig. S2C, 206 Fig. S3 A and B, E-F). Expression of NOTCH1 and NOTCH4 on Treg cells of MIS-C 207 patients was non-overlapping, suggesting that they may represent distinct Treg cell",1.0,flu,True
23,"208 populations possibly arising in different tissues (Fig. S3E-F). Also, there was no 209 difference in NOTCH3 expression between the circulating Treg and Tconv cells of 210 different patient populations and control subjects (Fig. S2D and Fig. S3C and D). Overall, 211 these results identified increased NOTCH1 expression on Treg and Tconv cells as a 212 distinguishing feature of pediatric patients with MIS-C. 213 Further analysis revealed that MIS-C patients present a decrease of naive Tconv and 214 Treg cells associated with an increase of activated T cells (Fig. S4 A to B). As in previous 215 studies (7), we found increased serum levels of IP-10, IL-1b, IL-6 and IFNl2/3 in MIS-C 216 and in severe COVID-19 compared to controls (Fig. 2H). Also, Treg and Tconv cells of 217 patients with MIS-C versus severe COVID-19, KD and control subjects had increased 218 IFN-g production (Fig. S4, C and D). Notably, IFN-g expression was selectively increased 219 in Treg cells of MIS-C subjects, while IFN-g expression in Tconv cells was common to 220 both severe COVID-19 and MIS-C (Fig. S4, C and D). We analyzed the capacity of 221 different cytokines found increased in the sera of MIS-C subjects to induce NOTCH1 222 expression on cell-sorted CD4+CD25+CD127- human Treg cells from control subjects. IL223 1b and IL-6, and to a lesser extent IFN-g and IP-10 all induced increased NOTCH1 224 expression on human Treg cells (Fig. 2I). MISC patients from North America and Europe 225 were overall closely matched in their immunological analyses, with only differences found 226 in NOTCH4, IP-10 and IFNL1 between these two cohorts (Fig.S5 A-F). Together, these 227 results linked the upregulation of NOTCH1 expression on CD4+ Treg and Tconv cells with 228 the development of MIS-C. 229 Identification of Notch pathway genetic variants in MIS-C.

24,"231 performed gene-enrichment tests for rare variants (stop-gain/start-loss, frameshift 232 deletions/insertions and canonical splicing mutations) using 8626 pathways from Gene233 Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases 234 (8,299 and 327 respectively). We collected genome and exome sequences on 39 MIS-C 235 and 24 acute pediatric COVID-19 subjects, which we compared with 8 different datasets 236 comprising 4,682 exomes collected at the Boston Children's Hospital, including 4 rare 237 disease categories, obesity, myopathy, autism-ADHD and Immune 238 deficiency/dysregulation (53) (see Methods section). All samples were processed using 239 the Variant Explorer (VExP) Pipeline with the same set parameters to avoid bias in the 240 selection of the rare variants (54). We performed a Fisher test for each group to test for 241 enrichment in the respective GO and KEGG pathways. Furthermore, we validated these 242 results by Monte-Carlo simulation testing as an unbiased stochastic approach to test for 243 enrichment in genetic variants along individual pathways in the MIS-C group versus the 244 sum total of the clinical comparison groups used for the Fisher tests, as described in the 245 Methods section. Several inflammation and autoimmunity pathways were significantly 246 enriched in rare mutations (10 in 280,000 chromosomes) in MIS-C versus acute 247 pediatric COVID-19 and the other comparison groups (Fig. 3A and B, Dataset 1). A 248 number of those pathways contained NOTCH related genes. Specific NOTCH pathway 249 mutations predicted to be damaging and linked to those pathways were identified included 250 NOTCH2, NOTCH4 and RBPJL (Dataset 2). Additionally, and in agreement with a 251 previous report (55), we also detected rare heterozygous mutations in some genes 252 associated with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, including AP3B1, PRF1,",1.0,COVID-19,True

Co-transfection studies revealed that the NUMBLeu94Phe behaved as a 278 dominant negative mutation that suppressed the capacity of NUMBWT to decrease 279 NOTCH1 and NOTCH1c expression (Fig. 4D). The NUMBLSer79IIe and NUMBLVal88Met also 280 behaved as dominant negative mutants in antagonizing the decrease in NOTCH1c (N1c) 281 expression induced by NUMBLWT (Fig. 4 E). Studies on the PBMCs of patients with the 282 NUMB and NUMBL mutations showed upregulation of NOTCH1 expression on the Treg 283 cells of all three patients (Fig. S6 A-C). Expression of N1c reflected the functional impact 284 of these mutations as revealed in the vitro testing (Fig. 4D and E), with the different 285 mutations falling along a spectrum of NUMBLeu94Phe > NUMBLSer79IIe > NUMBLVal88Met (Fig. 286 S6 A-F). These results established that the identified NUMB/NUMBL mutations were 287 functionally deleterious and that MIS-C subjects may harbor mutations in the Notch 288 pathway that contribute to disease pathogenesis. 289 Poly I:C-induced multiorgan inflammatory disease in Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice. To 290 further delineate the mechanisms by which increased NOTCH1 signaling in CD4+ T cells 291 promotes MIS-C, and in view of the critical role played by Treg cells in licensing Notch1292 dependent immune dysregulation (41, 42), we employed a mouse model in which the 293 intracellular domain of Notch1 (N1c) is conditionally expressed from the Rosa26 locus 294 (R26N1c/+) in Treg cells using a Foxp3 promoter-regulated Cre recombinase fused with 295 EGFP (Foxp3EGFPCre) (Fig. 5A) (41).

50,"299 cells of Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice revealed that their activation phenotype recapitulated 300 that of CD4+ T cells of MIS-C patients, including increased memory markers 301 (CD44+CD62L-) and heightened IFNg production by both Treg and Tconv cells (Fig. 5E302 G). 303 Most MIS-C patients present gastrointestinal symptoms (Table S1) (14) (13). Notably, the 304 Treg and to a lesser extent the Tconv cells of the Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice had 305 increased expression of the gut-homing integrin a4b7 (Fig. 5H). Increased expression of 306 integrin a4b7 (ITGB7) was also observed on the circulating Treg cells of MIS-C but not 307 acute pediatric COVID-19 subjects, in agreement with a critical role of Notch1 in driving 308 the expression of this marker (Fig. 5I). Consistent with this finding, MIS-C patients 309 exhibited an increase in CD62L-CD38+ mucosally imprinted Treg cells (Fig. S7A) (63, 310 64). sc-RNA seq analysis demonstrated increased ITGB7 transcripts (Fig. 5J and Fig. 311 S7B). Expression of integrin a4b7 on Treg cells of MIS-C subjects declined post312 treatment, in synchrony with decreased Notch1 and CD22 expression (Fig. 5K-M). These 313 results indicated that increased Notch1 activity in Treg cells predisposes to multi-organ 314 inflammation in the context of a viral trigger and promotes Treg cell gut homing. 315 Notch1-mediated CD22 upregulation on Treg cells promotes multi-organ 316 inflammation. To delineate the mechanisms by which Notch1 signaling in Treg cells 317 promotes multi organ inflammation in the context of a viral trigger, we analyzed the 318 transcriptome of Notch1c-expressing Treg cells for pathways involved in the immune 319 dysregulation (41). We found upregulation of CD22, a member of the Siglec family of 320 lectins normally found in B cells, where it acts to regulate B cell receptor signaling (45). 321 In particular, CD22 directs B cells to the intestinal lymphoid and mucosal tissues by",1.0,COVID-19,True

Flow cytometric 323 analysis of Treg cells of Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice revealed increased CD22 expression 324 upon treatment of the mice with Poly I:C (Fig. 6A). Expression of CD22 in Treg cells was 325 abrogated upon Treg cell-specific deletion of Rbpj, the gene encoding the Notch 326 canonical pathway transcriptional co-factor RBPJ (Fig. S8A). Analysis of peripheral blood 327 Treg cells of MIS-C subjects revealed increased expression of CD22 that strongly 328 correlated with NOTCH1 expression on these cells (Fig. 6B). CD22 expression was also 329 increased in patients with NUMB/NUMBL mutations in accord with the impact of the 330 mutation (Fig. S6 G-I). In contrast, CD22 was minimally expressed on CD4+ Tconv cells 331 of control, acute COVID-19 and MIS-C subjects, and it did not correlate with Notch1 332 expression on these cells signaling (Fig. 6B and C). These results indicated that CD22 333 was upregulated on Treg cells with active NOTCH1 signaling. 334 The functional relevance of CD22 expression on Treg cells was analyzed by performing 335 in vitro Treg cell suppression assays on Treg cells pooled from different mice, which 336 revealed profoundly defective suppressive function of CD22+ Treg cells of 337 Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice compared to Treg cells of Foxp3EGFPCre control mice. This 338 defect was corrected upon treatment of Treg cells with the anti-CD22 mAb (Fig. 6D). 339 Similarly, the suppressive function of MIS-C Treg cells was profoundly deficient compared 340 to that of Treg cells of healthy controls, which was corrected upon treatment of the cells 341 with the anti-CD22 mAb (Fig. 6E). 342 To determine the role of CD22 expression on Treg cells in the multi organ inflammatory 343 disease triggered by Poly I:C treatment of Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice, we examined the 344 impact of therapy with a neutralizing anti-CD22 mAb on disease outcome in these mice.",1.0,COVID-19,True
52,"345 Anti-CD22 mAb treatment prevented the weight loss and the multi-organ inflammation 346 induced by Poly I:C treatment (Fig. 7A-C). It downregulated the activation of splenic 347 CD44+CD62L- Tconv cells and the expression by Treg and Tconv cells of IFNg (Fig. 7C348 F). Anti-CD22 mAb treatment also downregulated the expression by splenic Treg cells of 349 a4b7 (Fig. 7F). Anti-CD22 mAb treatment did not deplete Treg cells (Fig. 7G). In contrast, 350 B cell depletion with an anti-B cell specific anti-CD20 mAb failed on its own to protect 351 against disease or to abrogate protection by anti-CD22 mAb treatment (Fig. S8B and C). 352 Analysis of gut lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) revealed increased infiltration with 353 activated (CD44+CD62L-) Tconv and Treg cells with increased expression of IFNg that 354 was similarly downregulated upon treatment with the anti-CD22 mAb (Fig. S8D and E). 355 Overall, these results indicated that anti-CD22 mAb treatment suppressed both the gut 356 and systemic inflammation induced by Poly I:C treatment of Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice. 357 To further link the above results with our human studies, we employed another mouse 358 model in which a floxed Numb allele was conditionally deleted in Treg cells 359 (Foxp3YFPCreNUMBD/D) (Fig. S9A and B). Treatment of Foxp3YFPCreNUMBD/D mice with 360 Poly I:C intraperitoneally resulted in progressive weight loss similar to what was observed 361 in Poly I:C-treated Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice. In contrast, Poly I: C-treatment of control 362 Foxp3YFPCre had no effect (Fig. S9C and D). Analysis of CD4+ T cells of 363 Foxp3YFPCreNUMBD/D mice revealed that their activation phenotype recapitulated that of 364 CD4+ T cells of MIS-C patients, including increased memory markers (CD44+CD62L-) 365 and heightened IFNg production by Tconv cells (Fig. S9E and F). Moreover, Treg cells of 366 Poly I:C-treated Foxp3YFPCreNUMBD/D mice also showed upregulation of Notch1, N1c, 367 CD22 and a4b7 that recapitulated the Treg cell phenotype of MIS-C patients and Poly",1.0,disease,True

Finally, treatment of 369 Foxp3YFPCreNUMBD/D mice with an anti-CD22 mAb prevented disease development 370 following Poly I:C treatment, downregulated Notch pathway and gut homing markers and 371 suppressed CD4+ T cell expansion and activation and IFNg expression in both the spleen 372 and the gut (Fig. S9A-M). Overall, these results indicated that Notch1-dependent 373 induction of CD22 expression on Treg cells plays a crucial pro-inflammatory role in Poly 374 I:C-treated Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice. 375 To determine the mechanisms by which CD22 subverted Treg cell function, we analyzed 376 the steady state transcriptome of a pool of CD22+ Treg cells of Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice 377 compared to control Foxp3EGFPCre Treg cells or CD22- Treg cells of Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+. 378 KEGG/GO pathway analysis showed increased expression of genes involved in the 379 regulation of the immune response, T cell migration and Notch signaling (Fig. S10A-F). 380 Furthermore, we analyzed by flow cytometry the phenotypes of CD22+ colonic and splenic 381 of Treg cells Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice isolated at steady state and following Poly I:C382 treatment in comparison with those of Treg cells of similarly treated Foxp3EGFPCre mice. 383 The CD22+ Treg cells exhibited decreased expression of Helios and NRP-1 both at steady 384 state and after Poly I:C treatment in the face of similar expression of markers of T cell 385 activation including CD44, suggesting their decreased stability (Fig. S10G and H). In 386 agreement with this conclusion, Foxp3 expression also decreased in CD22+ Treg cells 387 following Poly I:C treatment. Treatment with anti-CD22 mAb reversed those defects in 388 both colonic and splenic Treg cells (Fig. 8A and Fig. S10H and I). 389 CD22 regulates B cell receptor signaling by forming a molecular scaffold that enables 390 coordinated docking of different downstream signaling pathways (65).

Downstream of 394 the PI3-kinase pathway, phosphorylation of the kinase AKT at residue T308, a target of 395 upstream phosphoinositide-dependent kinases, and the mammalian target of rapamycin 396 complex 1 (mTORC1) substrate S6 kinase were also increased (Fig. 8C) (66, 67). 397 Treatment with an anti-CD22 mAb downregulated S6 phosphorylation, thus indicating 398 active intracellular signaling by CD22 in Treg cells (Fig. 9A and B). Anti-CD22 mAb 399 treatment corrected the decreased MFI of Foxp3 found at the end of the In-vitro Treg 400 suppressive assay, indicative of reversal of CD22+ Treg cell instability (Fig. 9C and D). 401 Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin reversed the regulatory defect in CD22+ 402 Treg cells and the associated loss of Foxp3 expression (Fig. 9E to G). These results 403 indicated that CD22 positively enhanced T cell receptor signaling in Treg cells leading to 404 their destabilization and loss of regulatory function by an mTORC1-dependent 405 mechanism. 406",1.0,positive,True
55,"407 Discussion 408 In this study, we demonstrate that MIS-C entails the mobilization of a Treg cell-specific 409 pathway involving Notch1-CD22 signaling that promotes immune dysregulation and 410 which can be demonstrated both in human subjects and in proxy mouse models. Patients 411 with MIS-C but not children or adults with acute COVID-19 demonstrated increased 412 NOTCH1 expression on circulating CD4+ Treg and Tconv cells, all of which declined 413 precipitously following anti-inflammatory therapy. The pathogenic function of this pathway 414 was confirmed by the identification of dominant negative mutations in PTB domains of 415 NUMB and NUMBL in MIS-C subjects that resulted in increased NOTCH1 expression. It 416 was also supported by the demonstration of a role for Notch pathway-related mutations 417 in MIS-C using Monte Carlo simulation and Fisher Test. Uniquely, MIS-C subjects 418 exhibited increased CD22 expression on Treg but not Tconv cells which could be 419 demonstrated in mice to involve Notch1 signaling via the RBPJ-k canonical pathway. 420 CD22 blockade was sufficient to inhibit the immune dysregulation triggered by Notch1 421 signaling in Treg cell in the Poly I:C proxy viral infection model, highlighting the critical 422 role of this molecule in MIS-C disease pathogenesis. 423 Our previous studies have identified NOTCH4 to be specifically upregulated on circulating 424 Treg cells in adult subjects with COVID-19; their origin could be traced in mouse models 425 of viral infection to the lung (36). NOTCH4 was similarly upregulated on circulating Treg 426 cells of pediatric subjects with acute COVID-19, while both NOTCH4 and NOTCH1 were 427 upregulated on those of MIS-C subjects. However, expression of NOTCH1 and NOTCH4 428 on MIS-C Treg cells was mutually exclusive, suggesting that the respective Treg cell 429 populations were ontogenically distinct. These findings suggest that NOTCH4 and",1.0,COVID-19,True
56,"430 NOTCH1 regulate distinct checkpoints in the evolution of immune dysregulation following 431 SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections. Thus, NOTCH4 appears critical for licensing lung 432 inflammation following SARS-CoV2, influenza and related viral infections (36). In contrast, 433 increased NOTCH1 expression on Treg and Tconv cells, with at least some of the latter 434 being derived from destabilized NOTCH1+ Treg cells, may favor the evolution of Th1435 skewed systemic inflammation (41, 42). Overall, our studies provide a mechanistic 436 framework for the evolution of autoimmunity in MIS-C by establishing Notch pathway437 dependent Treg cell dysfunction as a critical step in this process (16, 17, 25) 438 Mouse studies revealed that a critical step by which Notch1 signaling in Treg cells 439 promotes systemic inflammation involves its induction of CD22, an inhibitory receptor 440 previously associated with B cells, where it functions as a regulator of B cell receptor 441 signaling. More recently, CD22 has been described to direct the homing of B cells to the 442 gut lymphoid and mucosal tissues by virtue of its upregulation of the gut homing integrin 443 a4b7 (44). Consistent with these findings, treatment of mice whose Treg cells express a 444 gain of function Notch1 mutant with an anti-CD22 blocking antibody rescued their gut and 445 systemic inflammation following treatment with Poly I: C. CD22 impaired the in vitro Treg 446 cell suppressive function, an effect that was reversed by treatment with the anti-CD22 447 blocking antibody. Notwithstanding its function as an inhibitory receptor, Treg cells 448 expressing CD22 demonstrated increased T cell receptor signaling with increased 449 mTORC1 activity, leading to defective Treg cell suppressive function that was reversed 450 by treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. 451 MIS-C is a rare complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection (68), suggesting a genetic 452 predisposition to this disorder. In that regard, mutations in a number of immune regulatory",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
57,"453 genes have been described in MIS-C, including SOCS1, XIAP and CYBB as well as HLA454 class I alleles and rare heterozygous mutations in genes associated with hemophagocytic 455 lymphohistiocytosis (25, 27, 32, 55). We found variants in a number of Notch pathway 456 genes in patients with MIS-C. Importantly, dominant negative loss of function mutations 457 in NUMB and NUMBL found in MISC subjects resulted in increased NOTCH1 expression 458 and NOTCH1 signaling, consistent with the pathogenic function of these mutations in this 459 pathway in promoting MIS-C in the context of a systemic viral infection such as with 460 SARS-CoV2. 461 Collectively, these results allow for the construction of a model that traces the evolution 462 of MIS-C. An initial infection with the SARS-CoV2 virus results in the expansion of 463 NOTCH4 and NOTCH1 Treg cells, the latter favored by rare genetic variants found in the 464 susceptible host. A subset of NOTCH1+ Treg cells upregulates CD22, which severely 465 impairs their regulatory function and drives their homing to the gut where they promote 466 inflammation, possibly instigated by persistence of SARS-CoV2 in the gastrointestinal 467 tract and/or in reaction to the gut microbiota (14). This cascading immune dysregulatory 468 process may be amplified by heightened responses among some children to pathogen469 and damage-associated signals (21), which aggravates the systemic spread of 470 inflammation and the broad disruption of tissue Treg cell function. Importantly, Notch471 related immune dysregulation may extend to involve other disease states associated with 472 inflammation including other viral infections, inflammatory bowel disease and graft versus 473 host disease (41, 42, 44, 69). This dysregulation is reversible by anti-inflammatory 474 therapy that targets cytokines involved in Notch1 induction.
