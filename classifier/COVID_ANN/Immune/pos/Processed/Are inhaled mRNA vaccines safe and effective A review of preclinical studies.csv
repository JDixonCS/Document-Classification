15,"Introduction: Injected mRNA vaccines have been proven effective and safe in the SARS-CoV-2 pan­ demic. Using the machinery of the cell, mRNA vaccines translate into an antigen, which triggers an adaptive immune response. The effectiveness of intramuscular administered mRNA vaccines wanes in the months post-vaccination, which makes frequent booster administrations necessary. To make booster administration easier and increase efficacy, pulmonary administration could be investigated. The aim of this literature study was therefore to review the published preclinical (animal) studies on the safety and efficacy of pulmonary administered mRNA vaccines. Areas covered: We first provide background information on mRNA vaccines and immunological mechanisms of vaccination. Thereafter, we provide an evaluation of published animal studies, in which mRNA vaccines (or mRNA containing nanoparticles) were delivered into the lungs. We covered the following areas: biodistribution, cellular uptake, immune response, protection, and safety. All relevant papers were found using PubMed/MEDLINE database. Expert opinion: In our opinion, head-to-head comparison studies examining the safety and efficacy of intramuscular injected and pulmonary administered liquid mRNA vaccines should be performed first. When pulmonary delivered mRNA vaccines are shown to be effective and safe, inhalable dry powder formulations should be engineered. Finally, the tolerability of patients with respiratory diseases should be considered.",1.0,vaccine,True

19,"mRNA vaccines are of increased interest in the scientific world, predominantly caused by recent developments in the SARSCoV-2 pandemic. This pandemic has transformed the oncedismissed concept of mRNA vaccines into a powerful platform for eliciting potent immune responses. Unlike traditional vac­ cines, such as live-attenuated and inactivated organisms, or purified products derived from them, mRNA vaccines provide our cells with instructions on how to synthesize a specific protein - or in some cases a small part of a protein - to trigger an adaptive immune response [1-3]. To facilitate uptake by cells, mRNA is often formulated into ionizable lipid nanoparti­ cles (LNPs). This technology has been successfully implemen­ ted by BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna, resulting in the well tolerated and highly efficacious mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively [1,2]. These vaccines have been shown to reduce hospitalization rates by more than 90% upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.7 variant) in people who received two doses via intramuscular injection [4-6]. The pro­ tection conferred by these vaccines, however, has been shown to wane in the months following vaccination, even in indivi­ duals that received three doses [7-9]. The waning immunity is caused by a reduced immune response or by the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) display significantly dif­ ferent antigens than the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain that is used for the mRNA vaccines, but most likely both reasons play a role",1.0,vaccine,True
20,"[10-12]. The need for frequent booster injections is a burden to the health system and individual patient. In addition, the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains fairly high [13,14]. These findings highlight the importance of further considering strategies for improving the efficacy of mRNA vaccines, for instance, by looking into alternative administra­ tion routes (e.g. pulmonary, intramucosal, intradermal).",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
21,"To improve the vaccine's efficacy, it could be beneficial to use the same route of administration for the vaccine as the natural route of infection. Administering mRNA vaccines against airborne transmitted viruses via the pulmonary route, for instance, would eliminate the use of needles as well as the risk of needle-stick injuries and requirements for trained healthcare personnel [15]. Moreover, it is a lower burden to the vaccinee. The most important advantage of pulmonary administration, however, lies in the fact that this route not only produces a systemic immune response (e.g. IgG produc­ tion), as is the case after intramuscular injection, but also a local mucosal immune response (e.g. IgA production) [15- 17]. Intramuscular administration of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vac­ cines has shown to increase serum IgA levels as well, yet serum IgA peak levels were lower and declined more rapidly than serum IgG levels [18-20]. Furthermore, it has been shown that after SARS-CoV-2 infection secretory IgA levels in the mucosa persist longer and are more potent than serum IgA levels [18,20]. IgA responses are of particular interest since it",1.0,vaccine,True

32,"has been shown that IgA leads to cross-protection after influ­ enza infection or pulmonary vaccination with an influenza vaccine in both mice and human [21-26]. Therefore, the mucosal response has been postulated to improve the efficacy of vaccines [27-29]. The value of administering vaccines via the pulmonary route has been elegantly demonstrated by Tomar et al. [30]. In this study, the authors compared intra­ muscular injection to pulmonary administration in BALB/c mice and found the former approach yielded only IgG titers, whereas administration via the pulmonary route generated IgG and IgA titers [30]. This effect was observed for both influenza and hepatitis B vaccines, meaning immune responses are orchestrated not only against airborne infec­ tious diseases but also those spread via the blood or body fluids. Administering mRNA vaccines via the pulmonary route therefore seems highly attractive.",1.0,flu,True
33,"Already more than 50 years ago, the efficacy of pulmon­ ary administered influenza whole inactivated virus vaccine was demonstrated in humans [31]. In the past decade, several studies have been published in which pulmonary administration of mRNA-containing nanoparticles was eval­ uated in laboratory animals [32-53]. Some of those were focused on characterizing cell uptake and biodistribution, whereas others focused on analyzing immunological effects and safety. Only few studies examined mRNA used as a vaccine. We therefore decided to include studies focusing on mRNA vaccines, mRNA nanoparticles to increase protein levels or nanoparticles containing model mRNA as well. At this point, it is not entirely clear whether the pulmonary delivery route is suitable for the administration of mRNA vaccines, as the current state of knowledge has not been adequately reviewed yet. The aim of this literature study was therefore to investigate whether administration of mRNA vaccines via the pulmonary route is safe and effective based on published animal studies. In this review, we first provide background information on mRNA vaccines as well as immunological mechanisms of vaccination. We then dis­ cuss the published animal studies in terms of biodistribu­ tion, cell uptake, immunological effects, and safety. The review will end with our expert opinion, describing our interpretation of the data and vision for the future: a future that looks beyond intramuscular injection as a goto method for administering mRNA vaccines.",1.0,flu,True

35,"mRNA vaccines contain mRNA strands, encoding a diseasespecific antigen, formulated into nanoparticles [54]. Constructing the mRNA sequence represents the first step in vaccine development and requires special consideration. The mRNA is constructed using in vitro transcription (IVT). IVT is a process where the promoter of synthesized DNA is recog­ nized by a polymerase that produces multiple copies of the mRNA. The synthesized DNA is optimized by flanking the open reading frame (ORF) with untranslated regions (UTRs) and adding a poly-A tail at the 3' end to allow for efficient transla­ tion and stabilization [3,54-60]. Following transcription, the mRNA is purified and additional modifications are added, e.g. a 5' cap [55,56]. Other modifications are made to enhance the potency of mRNA vaccines, e.g. the substitution of base pairs reduces the activation of endosomal RNA-sensing proteins, such as toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 [56,58,59,61]. Uridine, for example, is often replaced by 1-methylpsuedouridine (m1), as the latter avoids activation of the antiviral immune response that leads to translational suppression in cells and, by extension, strongly reduced cellular and humoral immunity [54,59,61-63]. These mRNA modifications enable efficient anti­ gen expression.",1.0,vaccine,True
36,"The internalization of mRNA into cells requires nanopar­ ticles [64-66]. Using nanoparticles is crucial, as mRNA can­ not readily pass cell membranes due to its relatively large size and negative charge [54,64]. On top of that, nanoparti­ cles protect the single-stranded mRNA molecules from degradation by circulating nucleases. In the past decades, a myriad of (platform) technologies have been developed, often exploiting the unique properties of polymers, pep­ tides, or lipids [17,67,68]. The use of polymers, which may be synthetic (e.g. polyethylenimine (PEI)) or originate from natural sources (e.g. chitosan), was immensely popular in the past, but has slowly started giving way to lipid-based nanoparticles. This shift was caused by the increased avail­ ability of lipid nanoparticle technologies that have more desirable safety profiles. Due to these advantages and the fact that LNPs are used in the FDA-approved vaccines, they will be discussed in more detail [69]. Details about polymerbased and peptide-based nanoparticles are described else­ where [60,67,68,70]. LNPs represent the most advanced, clinically available technology. Formerly, positively charged LNPs were used, while recently neutral LNPs are more com­ mon [71]. LNPs are composed of various types of phospho­ lipids, such as ionizable lipids, helper lipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids [54,60,64,69,72]. Each of these lipids serves an important role. In physiological con­ ditions, LNPs are neutral, but upon uptake into endosomes, the ionizable lipids on the surface become charged, leading to endosomal disruption and release of mRNA into the cytosol [64]. The other lipids are used for stabilization pur­ poses and for controlling the size of nanoparticles. LNPs have also been shown to be exceptionally safe since low inflammation levels and a good tolerability have been shown in rats and monkeys and a low reactogenicity has been shown in human after intramuscular injection of LNPs [1,2,73,74].",1.0,negative,True

39,"Upon intramuscular injection, mRNA-containing nanoparticles are taken up by cells located near the injection site and by cells located in distal tissues (e.g. lymph nodes and liver) [75,76]. Cells capable of internalizing mRNA vaccines include not only antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells and macrophages, but also other nucleated cells, such as endothelial and epithelial cells [3]. Following endocytosis, endosomal escape of the mRNA into the cytosol is facilitated by the nanoparticle [3,61]. The mRNA is subsequently translated by ribosomes, resulting in the produc­ tion of antigen [3,61]. BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, for example, produce full-length spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and BNT162b1 encodes for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) [1,2,77]. Antigens in the cytosol are then degraded into smaller fragments by means of proteasomal degradation, after which the fragments are presented on the surface of cells by major histo­ compatibility complex (MHC)-1 proteins [3,77]. This route is avail­ able to APCs and all other nucleated cells. The antigen can also be excreted by, e.g., APCs to be consequently taken up again by APCs. In this case, the antigen is degraded into fragments through lysosomal degradation, and the resulting fragments are expressed on the surface of APCs by MHC-2 [3]. Since the mRNA is genetically modified to make it more stable, the mRNA can stay in the cytosol and produce the antigen for a few days before it is degraded [38].",1.0,vaccine,True

In the lymph nodes, APCs interact with naive lymphocytes that bear receptors capable of recognizing specific peptide fragment, a process called clonal selection. Only",0.0,,False
42,"a small fraction of these lymphocytes have receptors highly spe­ cific for the antigen. These cells then proliferate and differentiate, resulting in the production of effector cells. This step is called clonal expansion [3]. This process gives rise to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, which are able to kill infected cells, and CD4+ T helper cells, which help B cells to become antibody-producing plasma cells [78]. This represents the cellular component of the adaptive immune response [78]. The humoral component involves the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies by plasma cells. Selected lympho­ cytes are also transported to `infected' tissue via efferent lymph nodes and blood. Some of the lymphocytes persist in the body, providing long-term immunological memory of pathogens or parts of a pathogen [3,61]. The length of protection varies; in case of SARS-CoV-2, it may be fairly short-lived (<6 months) espe­ cially when new VoCs emerge [7,12,79].",1.0,case,True
43,"The lymphoid system plays an important role in orchestrating adaptive immune responses to pathogens. It is therefore not surprising that the route of administration for vaccines affects the extent to which such responses develop. Unlike intramuscular injection, pulmonary administration of vaccines against airborne transmitted viruses leads to the formation of inducible bronchusassociated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) [16,80-82]. iBALT represents a tertiary lymphoid structure, containing B cells and plasma cells as well as T cells and APCs, and is an effective priming site for mucosal immune responses [16,80-82].

IgA, produced by the mucosal tissue, serves an important function because it neutralizes pathogens and prevents them from binding to mucosal tissue [16,83-86].",0.0,,False
55,"Once infections have been cleared, or when the primary adaptive immune response has passed, effector lymphocytes and antibodies have accumulated at the infected site, or the site of injection for vaccines [63,78]. This offers protection against the same pathogen in the short term. Long-term protection is offered by memory B and T lymphocytes, which persist to afford protective immunity upon re-encountering a specific pathogen, or a small part of it [61,63,78,83]. In case of re-exposure, a secondary adaptive immune response is initiated [63,83]. This response is considerably stronger and faster than the primary response. In fact, successive exposure to a particular antigen leads to even more pronounced responses [63,83]. The resulting antibodies typically have an improved binding affinity for the respective targets [63]. BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, for instance, require two doses to generate sufficient cellular and humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and for some individuals three doses are recom­ mended [1,2,9,87,88]. Memory cells are therefore essential. The maintenance of these cell populations, be it within the lym­ phoid system or mucosal surfaces, does not require the pre­ sence of the original antigen; memory cells persist as long as they are exposed to pro-survival cytokines, such as IL-7 and IL15 [89].

60,"The first step of pulmonary vaccination is the administration of the formulation to the airways. We therefore first explored biodistribu­ tion profiles, as the deposition site has been shown to affect adaptive immune responses [30]. In one of the earlier reports, Su et al. [41] showed that intranasally administered mRNA-containing nanoparticles stay in the nasal cavity until 12 h after administration (Figure 3A). Lung deposition, however, remained limited. A few years later, Phau et al. and Li et al. reported similar findings: high expression levels of luciferase were detected in the nasal cavity only [34,51]. Limited lung deposition was mostly observed due to the fact that the authors administered too low volumes (i.e. one dose of 15-20 µL per nostril). Larger volumes and repeated intra­ nasal administrations (e.g. two doses of 20 µL) do lead to a fairly uniform deposition of nanoparticles containing mRNA throughout the lungs, as was shown by Robinson et al. [46].",1.0,,True
61,"Besides the volume, the device used to deliver the nanoparti­ cles containing mRNA to the lungs is relevant. With microsprayers and nebulizers, a large volume can be inhaled (50-100 µL), which ensures that the mRNA-containing nanoparticles reach the periph­ eral airways [33,36,38,40,47]. Patel et al. [36], for example, used a nebulizer to administer the mRNA nanoparticles pulmonary and showed that mRNA is distributed throughout every lobe (Figure 3B,C). Immunofluorescent staining showed that mRNAcontaining nanoparticles administered pulmonary using a microsprayer or nebulizer are evenly distributed throughout the lungs, as was shown by Tiwari et al.

264,"well, although this has not been investigated yet. We there­ fore analyzed studies to collect more information about this issue. The first study to assess cell uptake was conducted by Lorenzi et al. [32], who prepared naked mRNA encoding for Hsp65 in an attempt to protect mice from tuberculosis. Using flow cytometry, the authors found that the nanoparticles were taken up mostly by dendritic cells, while uptake by macro­ phages and B cells was marginal. Two years later, Andries et al. [35] reported that mRNA-containing GL67/DOPE/DMPEPEG5000 nanoparticles were mainly taken up by APCs in mice via phagocytosis, as the authors observed increased expression levels of IL-12, which is produced by APCs in response to antigenic stimulation. Interestingly, Van Hoecke et al. [48] showed that DOPAP/cholesterol nanoparticles con­ taining mRNA were predominantly taken up by alveolar macrophages, and to a lesser extent by dendritic cells. These observations were corroborated by Hajam et al. [44], who found that macrophages were responsible for the uptake of empty chitosan nanoparticles in chickens. Unfortunately, the authors did not examine the uptake of nanoparticles contain­ ing mRNA.",1.0,,True
265,"Although it seems as if only APCs take up nanoparticles, evidence suggests that they can also be internalized by non­ immune cells. Patel et al. [36], for example, used flow cytome­ try to reveal that epithelial as well as endothelial cells took up poly(beta-aminoester) (PBAE) nanoparticles containing lucifer­ ase mRNA. This might be related to differences in the materi­ als that the particles are made of. APCs probably take up nanoparticles in a relatively nonspecific manner, whereas for other cell types it may depend on the material. Similarly, Li et al. showed that mRNA encapsulated in CP2k nanoparticles were taken up by nasal epithelial cells and nasal associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) [34]. However, it is not clear whether these mRNA-CP2k nanoparticles ended up in the lungs as well [34]. Extensive uptake by a large number of cell types was demonstrated by Mays et al. [43], who administered naked mRNA encoding for Foxp3 in an attempt to treat allergic asthma. The authors found that the mRNA was taken up by eosinophils, CD4+ T cells, alveolar macrophages, and alveolar type II cells as well as neutrophils and lymphocytes, albeit to a lesser extent [43]. These findings are remarkable, considering the fact that the uptake of naked mRNA was shown to be negligible in vitro, owing to its large size and negative charge as well as susceptibility to nucleases [54,64]. Collectively, how­ ever, these studies do indicate that nanoparticles, when admi­ nistered via the pulmonary route, are mostly internalized by APCs, which is not surprising as they are known to have a tremendous phagocytotic capacity [92].",1.0,negative,True

269,"4.3.1. Humoral immune response The humoral, or antibody, immune response is essential for neutralizing foreign material, preventing the attachment of pathogens to host cells and marking the pathogen for destruction [3,93]. The first study that reported data on IgA and IgG titers was carried out by Li et al. [34]. In this study, intranasal administration of mRNA vaccines encoding for gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in mice was shown to increase IgG and IgA titers in the cervix and nasal tissue. The authors also confirmed the importance of incorpor­ ating mRNA into a nanoparticle, as this contributed to signifi­ cantly higher levels of IgG and IgA than naked mRNA. Moreover, the type of nanoparticle affected IgA and, to a lesser extent, IgG levels. Nanoparticles prepared from PEI yielded lower antibody titers than those made of CP2k. The cause of this difference is not fully understood, but it could be caused by intrinsic toxicity of PEI, leading to the death of cells that take up nanoparticles (e.g. APCs) or variations on uptake efficiency between the different nanoparticles [36,94]. Unfortunately, Li et al. [34] did not challenge mice with HIV after vaccination, and it is therefore not known whether pro­ tection was conferred. Follow-up work by Li et al. described similar results [53]. In this case, the authors treated mice with a mRNA vaccine encoding for ovalbumin. The nanoparticles were made from PEI or CP2k, the latter of which proved to produce superior levels of vaginal IgA and IgG. It remains unclear, however, whether antibody levels in the pulmonary mucosa follow the same pattern. As the authors used mRNA encoding ovalbumin, protection was not considered.",1.0,vaccine,True
270,"Later, Hajam et al. [44] studied IgA production in lung mucosa of chickens after pulmonary vaccination using either empty chitosan nanoparticles, chitosan nanoparticles with influenza HA2 and M2E proteins, or chitosan nanoparticles with influenza HA2 and M2E proteins and mRNA encoding for these proteins. The addition of mRNA to the nanoparticles resulted in higher IgA levels than those containing only pro­ tein. This effect was not observed for IgG titers. These authors also challenged the vaccinated chickens with live influenza virus. Chickens that received both protein and mRNAcontaining nanoparticles had significantly higher levels of virus-neutralizing titers than those receiving only proteincontaining nanoparticles. Unfortunately, head-to-head com­ parisons between intramuscular injections and pulmonary administration are very limited. In fact, the only study known to have done so was carried out by Anderluzzi et al. [50], who examined pulmonary delivered mRNA encoding for rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) encapsulated in four different lipid nanoparticles in mice (Table 2). While the four types of lipid nanoparticles only slightly differed in their lipid composition, their anti-RVG IgG responses differed significantly when admi­ nistered intramuscularly. No humoral response was shown after pulmonary vaccination since the mRNA vaccine was swallowed and did not reach the lungs. It is suggested that throat deposition occurred upon intranasal administration of the vaccine, followed by mucociliary clearance, resulting in swallowing of the mRNA nanoparticles.

330,"4.3.2. Cellular immune response Several studies examined whether pulmonary administered mRNA vaccines induced a cellular immune response (Table 2). The first study examining the T-cell response after pulmonary mRNA vaccination was conducted by Phau et al. [52]. These researchers studied whether mRNA vaccines induced an anti-tumor immune response. After intranasal vac­ cination, CD8 + T-cells were found in the spleen of mice vaccinated with mRNA nanoparticles, but this was not the case for naked mRNA. This suggests that the produced anti­ gen is only able to trigger a CD8 + T-cell anti-tumor response when the mRNA is encapsulated in a nanoparticle, ensuring efficient transfection. It was not studied, however, whether memory cells were formed. In two follow-up studies by Li et al. [34,53] it was shown that the cellular immune response depends on the type of nanoparticle used. The CD8+ and CD4 + T-cell responses after vaccination with a CP2k nanoparticle were significantly higher than after vaccination with a PEI nanoparticle, CP600 nanoparticle, and naked mRNA [34,53]. Mai et al. [49] also showed that the carrier influences the cellular immune response. In this study, the authors adminis­ tered an mRNA vaccine encoding for CK19, using cationic liposome/protamine complexes. These particles showed higher levels of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells than nanoparticles made from either solely liposomes or protamine. In the same year, Hajam et al.

To determine whether lung delivery of mRNA results in a different immune response than intramuscular injection, both administration routes should be considered. So far, only Anderluzzi et al. [50] examined the cellular immune response after either intramuscular or pulmonary administration of a mRNA vaccine to mice. Similar to the humoral immune response, the lipid composition of the nanoparticles deter­ mined the cellular immune response after intramuscular administration. The cellular immune response after pulmonary administration could not be determined since the vaccine was swallowed and did not reach the lungs.

The chickens vaccinated with empty chitosan nanoparticles showed a high viral load and inflammation in their lungs after influenza challenge.

Similar results were shown by Patel et al. [36]. Using H&E staining, they showed that lung delivery of mRNA-containing hDD90-118 nanopar­ ticles resulted in normal lung histology and weight loss was not observed. However, mRNA encapsulated in PEI resulted in weight loss, although inflammation of the lungs was not observed (Figure 4A). This result was confirmed by Tiwari et al.

These studies showed that PEI nanoparticles are toxic and should not be used for pulmonary delivery of mRNA [94]. Besides PEI, lipids can have toxic effects as well. Andries et al.

353,"The aim of this literature study was to determine whether pulmonary administration of mRNA vaccines represents a suitable alternative to intramuscular injection. To that end, we carefully reviewed animal studies. These studies clearly showed that a uniform distribution of mRNA over the lung can be achieved when mRNA containing vaccines are properly pulmonary administered. Upon lung delivery, the mRNA is taken up mostly by APCs, owing to their phagocytotic capa­ city. In turn, APCs were shown to successfully express and present the antigens, resulting in the initiation of potent adaptive immune responses, both on a humoral and cellular level. Some studies also demonstrated that this approach protected animals from disease during challenges. With respect to safety, we were able to identify some issues related to the materials that nanoparticles are prepared from; PEI, for example, caused acute inflammation. In future studies, com­ parisons should be made between pulmonary administration and intramuscular injection. This will improve our understand­ ing of whether pulmonary administration of mRNA vaccines could lead to dose-sparing and better protection, for instance.",1.0,vaccine,True

355,"We identified several omissions and challenges when examin­ ing the publications investigating pulmonary delivered mRNA. For example, fundamental data about the uptake mechanism of the mRNA containing nanoparticles by cells, quantitative data about the amount of protein that is produced by the mRNA, and a connection between the amount of protein produced and the extent of the immune response initiated are lacking. Moreover, the reviewed publications did not take intramuscular injection of mRNA vaccines into account as a control when investigating pulmonary delivery of mRNA vaccines. In the future, studies should investigate differences in humoral and cellular responses in a head-to-head compar­ ison between intramuscular injection and pulmonary admin­ istration of mRNA vaccines, in particular concerning IgA titers. IgA plays a crucial role in the humoral mucosal immune response fighting respiratory infections and it leads to crossprotection [21-26]. In line with this, it has been shown that intrapulmonary and intranasal delivered vaccines against SARS-CoV in rodents and influenza in humans showed a better protection against infection than intramuscular injec­ tion, due to increased IgA levels after pulmonary vaccine delivery [21,102-105]. Moreover, future studies should investi­ gate whether the immune response results in protection and how long immunity through pulmonary vaccination lasts (Figure 5).",1.0,vaccine,True
356,"Besides the induction of a protective immune response, a pulmonary delivered mRNA vaccine should be proven safe. It was described that pulmonary administration of polymerbased nanoparticles engineered from PEI caused increased",1.0,protective,True
357,"levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the animals lost weight, indicating that PEI is too toxic [36,40,53]. Lipid nano­ particles carrying mRNA administered pulmonary have been considered safe according to the discussed animal studies in this review. Furthermore, clinical data of the intramuscular delivered mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 show that lipid nanoparticles are safe and participants to clinical phase I and II trials where intramuscular delivered mRNA lipid nanoparticles are used to treat different types of cancer tolerate the lipid nanoparticles very well [1,2,4,5,106]. However, detailed infor­ mation about the safety of lipid nanoparticle following pul­ monary delivery is not yet available. Several techniques are available to determine the toxicity of pulmonary administered nanoparticles in the lung: H&E staining, deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), and KI67. With these techniques, inflammation, cell death, and cell pro­ liferation, respectively, can be examined [107-109]. A relatively new technique to examine toxicity is human lung slices, a technique where precision-cut slices of the lungs are exposed to the compound of interest [110]. Tissue slices are especially interesting for short-term toxicity studies. However, we suggest using a carefully chosen animal model to study safety, immune responses, and protection of the mRNA vac­ cines in a living system (e.g. non-human primates) [111].",1.0,clinical,True
358,"When sufficient information is available showing that pul­ monary administration of mRNA vaccines is safe and effective, a suitable inhalable formulation should be developed. Various inhalation devices exist, such as soft mist inhalers, nebulizers, metered-dose inhalers, and dry powder inhalers (DPIs) [107,112,113]. Of these devices, DPIs are of particular interest since they are distributed easily and the administration is simple [114-116]. Pulmonary vaccination with DPIs has several advan­ tages over liquid formulations, as discussed in a review by Tonnis et al. [15]. mRNA vaccine powder suitable for inhalation could be engineered by spray-drying or spray-freeze-drying in combination with stabilizing excipients, as discussed in the study of Saluja et al. [117]. We expect that sugars are essential to ensure a good stability of mRNA nanoparticles, since mRNA vaccines are inherently unstable, requiring a cold-chain [73]. Stabilizing excipients like sucrose seems promising since it effec­ tively protects the mRNA-containing nanoparticles from freezing damage [73,118]. Yet, a translation must be made to spraydrying and spray-freeze-drying [17]. We therefore recommend examining different sugars and different conditions for spraydrying and spray-freeze-drying (e.g. flow rate, freezing-rate) in order to engineer a mRNA-containing nanoparticle formulation with a long-term stability, preferably at ambient conditions.",1.0,vaccine,True
359,"Whilst formulating mRNA vaccines into inhalable dry pow­ ders, special care should be taken to investigate whether they are well-tolerated by patients suffering from respiratory dis­ eases, especially those of a chronic nature (e.g. chronic obstruc­ tive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and asthma). In these patients, the lung architecture may be severely remodeled, affecting not only their ability to inhale but also to elicit effective immune responses [119]. This could affect the efficacy and safety of pulmonary delivered mRNA vaccines. A risk of mRNA delivered pulmonary is that an inflammatory response could be induced. This risk could be reduced by modifying the mRNA, e.g. by replacing uridine by m1",1.0,vaccine,True

362,"[54,59,61-63]. It is suggested that nanoparticles are safe to inhale for patients with respiratory diseases, since several types of inhalable nanoparticles have already been used in medication for asthma, COPD, and lung cancer, providing positive treatment effects [120]. These data indicate that also mRNA containing nanoparticles can be safely administered to patients suffering from lung diseases via the respiratory route. However, the safety and efficacy aspects of lung delivered mRNA have not yet been examined extensively. We suggest that first the safety and effi­ cacy of different forms of mRNA and mRNA-containing formula­ tions (e.g. nanoparticles) including the effect of composition, structure, and physical properties delivered into the lung should be examined in animal models with respiratory diseases. Consequently, these pulmonary administered mRNA vaccines could be investigated in clinical studies.",1.0,respiratory,True
363,"In 5 years from now, we expect that more information regard­ ing the efficacy and safety of pulmonary delivered, and intramus­ cular injected mRNA vaccines will be available. First, the short-term safety of mRNA lipid nanoparticles using lung slices, and in parti­ cular human lung slices, will be examined. When the short-term safety is clear, and a suitable lipid nanoparticle is formulated, a preclinical animal study should be performed. Within 5 years more insights into the efficacy and safety of both pulmonary and intramuscularly administered mRNA vaccines, preferably in a headto-head comparison, will be gained. When the safety and efficacy are clear, we can work toward the development of dry and stable inhalable formulations, which are also tolerated by patients suffer­ ing respiratory diseases. The results so far are convincing, indicat­ ing that more research regarding lung delivered mRNA vaccines is worthwhile.",1.0,vaccine,True
