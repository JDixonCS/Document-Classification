6,"As soon as the first case of the omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was reported in November 2021, it quickly spread worldwide with the emergence of several subvariants. Compared to previous variants, omicron was heavily mutated, especially for those in the Spike (S) protein and its receptor-binding domain. These mutations allowed the viruses to evade immune responses (i.e., previous infections and vaccine-elicited) and increase in transmissibility. Although vaccine effectiveness is decreased for omicron, boosters remain effective for protecting against severe diseases. Also, bivalent vaccines have been developed to increase vaccine effectiveness. Interestingly, although omicron is highly infectious, it has less morbidity and mortality compared to previously identified variants, such as delta. Additionally, the mutations that allow the virus to evade immune responses also allow it to evade many of the monoclonal antibodies developed at the beginning of the pandemic for treatment. Here, we reviewed the omicron variant's epidemiology, genetics, transmissibility, disease severity, and responsiveness to vaccine and treatments.",1.0,case,True

Thirty of these mutations were in the S protein and 15 were mutated sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Such extensive mutation in the S protein pointed to likely immune evasion, likely antibody, which explains its increased infectiousness and breakthrough infections compared to other SARS-CoV-2 variants.5 Table 1 presents the summary of mutational differences across VOC and sublineages of omicron.

The study matched the omicron cohort with the delta cohort for demographics that included the socioeconomic determinants of health, comorbidities, COVID-19-related medications, and vaccination status. The data showed that the omicron cohort's 3-day risk of hospitalization from SARS-CoV-2 infection, emergency room visit, intensive care unit admission, and use of mechanical ventilation were significantly lower than those of previous variants.14 A national cohort from Scotland also showed that COVID-19 hospitalization decreased in the S-gene-negative group (compared to the S-gene-positive group) after adjusting confounders.15",1.0,COVID-19,True

Interestingly, the G496S mutation of BA.1 is known to have the highest affinity.10 Additionally, Hui, et al.17 also found that the omicron replicated significantly faster than the original strain or delta variant in the human bronchi, which may suggest higher infectious virus load in the airways.

Since the RBD is most targeted for the immune system, mutations in these sites are considered to influence the ability of antibodies to neutralize the virus. One study found that convalescent patients' serum and vaccine serum neutralization activities against omicron were lowered compared to the original strain and other variants.27 In addition, a study compared each omicron subvariants' neutralizing antibody titers in people who had been boosted with an mRNA vaccine, and found that titers of neutralizing antibody were different for each subvariant. Specifically, compared to the BA.1 subvariant, BA.2.12.1 and BA.4 or BA.5 were lower by the factor of 1.5 and 2.9, respectively.28 Another study showed that BA.4 and BA.5 were more resistant to neutralization by boosted vaccine than BA.1, and BA.2.11",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

It found that previous infection, booster of vaccination, and hybrid immunity offered protection from both BA.1 and BA.2 subvariants in terms of severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19.31 Now, more countries are offering second booster vaccines for higher risk populations. For example, in Israel, a fourth dose of BNT162b2 vaccine began in January 2022 when the B.1.1.529 variant was predominant. During this period, the team compared people who received four doses of vaccine with people who had received only three doses, and found that the people who received four doses had greater protection against severe illness.
