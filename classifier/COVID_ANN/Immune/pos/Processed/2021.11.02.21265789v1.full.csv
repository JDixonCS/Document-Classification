5,"Patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) can experience life-threatening respiratory distress, blood pressure dysregulation and thrombosis. This is thought to be associated with an impaired activity of angiotensinconverting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which is the main entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and which also tightly regulates blood pressure by converting the vasoconstrictive peptide angiotensin II (AngII) to a vasopressor peptide. Here, we show that a significant proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed autoantibodies against AngII, whose presence correlates with lower blood oxygenation, blood pressure dysregulation, and overall higher disease severity. Anti-AngII antibodies can develop upon specific immune reaction to the SARS-CoV-2 proteins Spike or RBD, to which they can crossbind, suggesting some epitope mimicry between AngII and Spike/RBD. These results provide important insights on how an immune reaction against SARS-CoV-2 can impair blood pressure regulation.",1.0,respiratory,True

10,"virus of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), infects cells by binding to angiotensinconverting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) via the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its Spike protein. ACE-2 is an enzyme expressed on the surfaces of alveolar epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells (1), among others, that plays an important role in regulating blood pressure by converting the vasoconstrictive peptide angiotensin II (AngII) to the vasopressor peptide angiotensin-(1-7) (2, 3). It is known that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to dysregulation of vascular tension, endothelial inflammation and enhanced thrombosis, presumably through enhancing endocytosis of ACE-2 and thereby lowering its cell-surface presence (4, 5).",1.0,coronavirus,True
11,"Here, we sought to explore whether SARS-CoV-2 infection might induce autoantibodies against the peptide AngII. We hypothesized that the simultaneous binding of SARS-CoV-2 and AngII to ACE-2 might lead to their co-phagocytosis by antigenpresenting cells, thus providing a strong immune adjuvant (the virus molecules) to the self-peptide AngII, leading to an anti-AngII autoimmune response (6, 7). Moreover, we asked whether some epitope mimicry might exist between a domain on the Spike protein and AngII, based on their shared binding to ACE-2. Importantly, the induction of antiAngII antibodies in COVID-19 patients, if it occurs, could interfere with AngII processing by ACE2 and signaling to its receptors, potentially contributing to the dysregulation of vascular tension and worsening acute respiratory distress syndrome(8, 9).",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
12,"We conducted observational studies using serum of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and determined that such autoantibodies are indeed induced, independently of anti-RBD levels. Instead, their presence and levels were strongly correlated with blood pressure dysregulation and poor oxygenation. We finally demonstrated cross-reactivity of some antibodies between AngII and the Spike protein, suggesting immune epitope homology between these molecules.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Surprisingly, we found that a substantial proportion, 63% (73/115), of the COVID-19 patients had positive levels of anti-AngII autoantibodies, as determined by an ELISA absorbance greater than 3 standard deviations above the mean of the control donor group (Fig. 1A). Of these, 53% (39/73) had high levels, defined as greater than twice the positive threshold. In contrast, only one control donor (1.7%) was antiAngII positive, with a level just above the positive limit. Patient age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) were not significantly correlated with anti-AngII positivity (Fig S1A-D), although older patients trended towards increased levels of anti-AngII (p,""0.064 by Spearman correlation, Fig. S1A).

Interestingly, we detected anti-AngII antibodies in 15% of these hypertensive donors (Fig. 1A, B), which was far less than in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, when comparing the HTN vs. non-HTN COVID-19 patients, the levels of anti-AngII were similar (Fig. 1C) as well as the percentages with positive levels (65% and 60%, respectively; Fig. 1D).

However, correlations between anti-RBD levels and anti-AngII levels were only modest; in fact, a majority of anti-AngII(-) patients developed antibodies against RBD (Fig. 1E), and patients with high anti-RBD titers did not necessarily develop anti-AngII antibodies (34% remained anti-AngII(-)) (Fig. 1F).

Of note, although both Spike and AngII share the same receptor, ACE-2, their binding on ACE-2 occurs at 2 distinct locations (Fig. S4) (10, 11). Importantly, most regions targeted by clones E7 and/or B938M have been characterized as being the main B cells epitopes in COVID patients (colored regions in Fig. 4E, F, Fig. S3D) (12, 13).

67,"We observed that mice raised anti-Spike/RBD antibodies in all regions previously targeted by the monoclonal anti-AngII upon vaccination with Spike+MPLA/alum (Fig. S5A), while mostly in the region aa447-aa468 upon vaccination by RBD+MPLA/alum (Fig. S5B). The profiles of anti-AngII(+) and anti-AngII(-) mice were very similar, except for a small increase in binding of anti-Spike to the region aa447aa468 and anti-RBD to aa551-585, in anti-AngII(+) mice. As to the COVID-19 patients, they raised anti-Spike antibodies against 3 out of the 5 anti-AngII-targeted regions, namely aa551-aa585, aa786-aa804 and aa1131-1160, with a slightly higher binding observed to aa786-aa804 in anti-AngII(+) plasma (Fig. S5C).

71,"SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to induce broad immune dysregulation (15, 16), including generation of wide-ranging autoantibody responses (17). For example, generation of autoantibodies against phospholipids has been shown to contribute to coagulation disorders (18, 19), and against Type I interferons to reduced immune response to infection (20). Here, we show that autoantibodies can be generated against AngII, a key regulator of vascular tension. We further show that generation of anti-AngII autoantibodies correlated with disease severity as reflected in dysregulation of vascular tension and lower blood oxygenation. This, along with our in vitro signaling data, suggests that the anti-AngII autoantibodies, even if low affinity, may be able to interfere with signaling between AngII and its receptors AT1 and ACE-2. Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients had also been shown to develop autoantibodies against AT1 and ACE-2, which similarly correlated with enhanced pro-inflammatory responses and increased disease severity (21, 22). Such autoantibodies against AT1 and ACE-2 have been also observed in patients suffering from other vascular pathologies, particularly in malignant hypertension (8) or constrictive vasculopathy (9). Therefore, systematic quantification of autoantibodies against key molecules of the renin-angiotensin pathway (i.e. AngII, AT1, and ACE-2), in diseases characterized by vascular dysregulation, including COVID-19, might reveal a common underlying autoimmune etiology. Lastly, we highlighted the immune epitopes of Spike that could share structural homology with AngII, providing molecular insights in the immune mechanisms that could lead to the generation of anti-AngII autoantibodies upon infection by SARS-CoV-2.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
