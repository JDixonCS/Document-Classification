9,"Abstract Background: Studies of anti-­SARS-­CoV-­2 humoral and adaptive response in COVID-­19 non-­vaccinated pediatric convalescents are controversial and further evidence from the pediatric population are needed. Objectives: To elucidate SARS-­CoV-­2 humoral and memory B-­ and T-­cells responses in pediatric convalescents as compared with the adult. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 80 non-­vaccinated, IgG-­positive, COVID-­19 convalescents (age 8.0-­61.0years), 4.0 months from onset. Frequency of responders and magnitudes of SARS-­COV-­2 IgG, memory B-­cells (MBC) and IFNg-­  and IL2-­secreting memory T-­cells (MTC) in response to immuno-­dominant peptide pools in pediatric, young adults and middle-­aged adults with onset age 8-­18years (N ,"" 20), 19-­39years (N "", 30) and 40-­61years (N ,"" 30), respectively, were analyzed.

Results: MBC level was lower in pediatric as compared with the middle-­aged adults (median 12.75 interquartile range [IQR] 4.27-­33.7 and 32.0 IQR 6.0-­124.2, respectively, p "","" .003).

20,"Pediatric COVID-­19 is characterized by more frequent mild/asymptomatic disease than adults. Meta-­analysis of 50,000 COVID-­19 patients, estimated 27.7% of asymptomatic infections in pediatric as compared with 9.0% in older ages.1 Better capacity to control SARS-­CoV-­2 infection in pediatric population could be explained by efficient clearance of the virus, immunity to previous coronaviruses and age-­associated attributes of innate and adaptive immunity.2 Studies of humoral and adaptive memory T cells (MTC) responses in COVID-­19 pediatric convalescents are controversial. Previous studies demonstrated low magnitude3 and frequencies4 of SARS-­CoV-­ 2-­specific MTC in pediatric as compared with adult convalescents. In contrast, another study5 reported a 2-­fold higher magnitude and frequency of SARS-­CoV-­2-­specific IFNg-­secreting MTC in pediatric convalescents than in adults. The study by Rowntree et al.4 is the first to analyze memory B cells (MBC) in pediatric convalescents and report a low frequency of MBC as compared to adults. The understanding of COVID-­19 immunity in children is based mainly on immunological concepts evaluated in adults and empirically applied to the pediatric population and urges further evidence from the pediatric population. Elucidating SARS-­CoV-­2 MBC and MTC responses in pediatric convalescents are of paramount relevance from a clinical and public health perspective, mainly because it may allow us to assess re-­infection severity and the need to vaccinate children. Here, we compared SARS-­CoV-­2-­specific IgG levels, MBC and IFNg-­  and IL2-­secreting MTC in response to SARS-­CoV-­2S1 (Spike 1) and SNMO [Spike, Nucleoprotein, Membrane protein and Open reading frame (ORF-­3a and ORF-­7a)] peptide pools in pediatric and adult COVID-­19 convalescents. Indeed, our study is the first to simultaneously assess both frequencies and magnitude of SARS-­CoV-­2 specific IgG, MBC and MTC in pediatric convalescents.",1.0,asymptomatic,True

A possible explanation for this discrepancy could be attributed to different baseline immunity between pediatric cohorts.3,5 Dowel et al report that the pediatric group had higher cross-­reactivity with previous beta-­coronaviruses (OC-­43, HKU-­1) or alpha-­coronaviruses (NL-­63, 229E) than adults, which eventually boosted IgG and T cells' reactivity.5 Notably, Cohen et al3 analyzed a pediatric cohort that was characterized by lower cross-­reactivity with previous common cold-­CoV infections and this cohort was characterized by lower adaptive response than adults.3 Although we did not monitor the cross-­reactivity with previous coronaviruses, yet based on our results, we cannot exclude that our pediatric group more resemble the cohort described by Cohen et al..3 Moreover, our results at least in part of IgG titer and frequency of MBC and MTC are corroborated with a recent study by Rowntree et al showing a low frequency of MTC and MBC pediatric subjects as compared with adults.4",1.0,coronavirus,True
77,"The observed differences in adaptive immunity between pediatric and adult convalescents are likely owing to patient age and the associated rich common cold b-­corona virus exposure history in pediatric and adult patients with enriched specific MBC and MTC.21,22 Here, we demonstrate that while frequencies of MBC-­ positive subjects in pediatric and adult groups are comparable,",1.0,positive,True

81,"pediatric subjects are characterized by lower SFU magnitude of RBD-­specific MBC response. The role of MBC and MTC in SARS-­ CoV-­2 re-­infection is unclear, however, in a mice model of influenza it was demonstrated that the low level of MTC, maintained in the periphery dictates an insufficient level of protection during a secondary pathogen challenge.23,24 Notably, in view of the waning of SARS-­CoV-­2 IgG and specific memory cells several months following immunization,7,25-­28 it has been demonstrated that the number of pre-­existed memory cells could be boosted by repeated vaccinations.28 A study by Yoshida et al.29 suggests a possible explanation for diminished adaptive immunity in pediatric convalescents. This study demonstrates higher expression of antiviral IFN-­related genes in nasal, tracheal and bronchial airways in pediatric than in adult COVID-­19 patients, which may restrict viral systemic spread in children.29 The authors suggest that lower systemic viral load in children could be associated with lower adaptive memory during the convalescence period, which indeed is demonstrated in our study. In accordance, we assume that activated antiviral IFN-­related mechanism in upper respiratory tracts of pediatric subjects will restrict the viral spread and protect from serious outcomes also in case of re-­infection. We do not have follow-­up data regarding re-­infections in our cohort. Yet, a recent publication by Mensah et al. reported a lower risk for COVID-­19 re-­infections in the pediatric population (<16years) as compared to adults, suggesting that low adaptive immunity is not associated with a higher risk for re-­infections.30 These results sustain the crucial role of innate immunity as previously proposed by Yoshida et al.29",1.0,flu,True
82,"There are number of limitations in our study. Because of the difficulty to obtain a parental signed consent for pediatric healthy subjects the cutoffs for magnitude and frequency of positive humoral and adaptive immune responses for pediatric convalescents were assessed from healthy adults. Of note, our study focused on both SARS-­CoV-­2 PCR and IgG positive convalescents and further study is needed to evaluate adaptive immunity in PCR positive and IgG negative subjects. While the pediatric cohort was characterized by a mild clinical presentation at disease onset, we restricted our adult cohort to convalescent subjects that were characterized by mild symptoms and our conclusions are questionable in subjects with severe disease.",1.0,positive,True
