15,"Background: The circadian clock regulates the function of the immune system, the replication of viruses, and the magnitude of infections. The aim of this study was to analyse whether hospital attendance in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients presents a diurnal variation. Methods: Data from the electronic medical records of 1094 COVID-19 patients who presented to a Health Centre in Qatar during the month of July 2020 was retrospectively analysed. The following demographic (i.e. time of day (TOD), sex, age), clinical (i.e. cycle threshold (CT), temperature, oxy-haemoglobin saturation and resting heart-rate), biochemical (i.e. uraemia, glycaemia and albuminia) and haematological (i.e. leukocytes, erythrocytes ad platelets) parameters were collected. Results: Univariate analysis showed a significant effect of TOD on hospital admission (p < 0.001), with patients attending the health care centre more during the active behavioural phase (08h00-00h00) compared to the resting phase (00h00-08h00). COVID-19 infection blunted the circadian rhythms of core body temperature, neutrophils and leukocytes family and shifted the circadian rhythms of resting heart-rate and uraemia. Correlation analysis showed a near perfect negative correlation between the age of patients and the TOD (rº-0.97), with older patients attending the care centre earlier during the day. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection affected the circadian rhythms of the host through disrupting the circadian rhythms of core temperature and innate immunity mediators. Old patients attend the health care centre earlier compared to younger ones. However, CT during polymerase chain reaction-test was unaffected by the TOD, which limits the conclusion that COVID-19 viral infection exhibits diurnal variation.",1.0,Coronavirus,True

19,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been declared a public health epidemic of global outrage by the World Health Organisation (WHO), is among the most shocking diseases in recent years [1]. There were nearly 620 M laboratory reported cases and over 6.5 M deaths worldwide as of 26 September 2022 (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).

28,"way of hormones, clock genes and body temperature [5,6]. Circadian rhythmicity is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that serves to adapt the organism to the 24-h environmental day [7,8]. Because the exposition of the host to pathogens varies across the 24-h cycle, the circadian clock anticipates environmental daily changes in order to optimize the immune response [8-10]. Several types of illness exhibit diurnal variation [11,12]. For instance, respiratory diseases (viral and allergic rhinorrhoea, nocturnal asthma, and chronic pulmonary obstructive disease) display circadian variation with symptoms and/or gravity requiring hospital attendance occurring during the night [11]. Consequently, mediators of the immune system have been shown to exhibit diurnal variations in the blood and tissues, including immune cells, antibodies, cytokines, chemokines and hormones [10]. During the active phase, immune cells migrate to the peripheral tissues in a major anti-microbial response, and the circulating number of immune cells increases during the night [13].",1.0,respiratory,True
29,"Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 seem to be comparable, with some differences, to influenza [14]. As previous research confirmed that influenza infections and the severity of symptoms are affected by the time of the day (TOD) [11], it seems prudent to study the effect of TOD on COVID-19 patient hospital attendance. Importantly, a recent study reported a diurnal variation in the positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test, with a peak around 14h00 [15]. It has been consistently reported that circadian rhythm regulation differs between males and females [16], with females displaying smaller diurnal amplitude of temperature [17] and higher diurnal amplitude of melatonin [7] compared to males. Further, males and females sleep differently [18] and respond differently to sleep deprivation [17-19]. Indeed, the COVID-19 and its associated lockdown affected the sleep-wake cycle [20-22], with female being more disrupted than males [23-25]. However, little is known concerning the existence of a sex-based time course of COVID-19 patients' hospital attendance. Both physiological sleep and endogenous melatonin secretion, which present sex-based differences, play an important role in innate immunity regulation [26,27]. The observation that COVID-19 patients reported highly disturbed sleep-wake cycles [24] may be indicative of an infection-based circadian disruption. In addition, older people show reduced circadian flexibility and could be more affected when facing a circadian disrupter [16].",1.0,Clinical,True
30,"Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the diurnal distribution of hospital attendance in COVID-19 positive patients. The second aim was to study the sex and age differences in COVID-19 positive patients attending hospital.

190,"nocturnal sleep [12]. This could be consequent to symptoms aggravation during the previous night. It was reported that asthma is more severe during the night time [29], probably because of the infectioninduced disruption in innate immunity [30]. It is well known that innate and adaptive immunities are under tight circadian control, with circulation peak occurring during the early night [30-34]. However, the current results showed that the circadian rhythms of neutrophils and leukocytes families were blunted in COVID19 positive patients attending the hospital. In cases of viral infection, clock gene expression is disturbed due to systemic inflammation [35,36]. The proinflammatory cytokine interferon is released chronically during viral infection, which has the ability to interfere with circadian regulation [37]. This could indicate that SARSCov-2 infection affected clock gene expression, namely the brain and muscle ARNT-like 1, which dampened the diurnal variation of immune cells activities [36]. A near perfect reverse correlation (r º ¿97) was found between age and TOD in hospital attendance, with older patients attending the health care centre earlier during the day compared to younger patients. For instance, morningness preference (shift of rest/activity rhythm to the morning) is associated with advanced age [16,38], which could explain why older patients attend the health care centre at an earlier TOD compared to younger patients. Also, ageing is the most significant risk factor for developing severe outcomes and fatality in COVID-19 patients [2]. Indeed, developing severe COVID-19 outcomes could be related to the age-related immunosenescence [2], which could be defined as a chronic, low grade activation of proinflammatory process within the aged-organism [16]. The current data showed that oldest patients attended the care centre between 00h00 and 04h00. This could be explained by the increased asthma symptoms during the night [29] and the age-related decrease in physiological reserve in the respiratory system [2] that has aggravated COVID-19 symptoms, requiring immediate hospital attendance in older patients.",1.0,positive,True
191,"The current results showed that the CT (i.e. viral load) was unaffected by the TOD. Therefore, the assumption that COVID-19 hospital attendance is affected by the TOD could be somehow misleading. Contrarily, a recent study showed that the viral load was lower during the day in SARS-CoV-2 patients [15]. In fact, only female patients showed a trend towards lower CT values between 16h00 and 20h00, but this difference was not significant. These conflicting results might be explained by the sample size, which is larger from different locations and with a longer collection",1.0,COVID-19,True

193,"It has consistently been reported that core body temperature displays a strong circadian rhythmicity [39,40], which was blunted in the current study by COVID-19 infection. This could be explained by the infection-induced fever, which is associated with improved survival and resolution of infection [41]. In addition, COVID-19 infection shifted the circadian rhythms of resting heart-rate. Physiological resting heart-rate is higher during the morning [40,42] but in the current study, heart-rate was higher during the night (20h00-00h00) compared to the other TODs. Indeed, weak but highly significant correlations were found between CT on the one hand, and core body temperature and heart-rate on the other hand. In addition, SARS-Cov-2 infection shifted the circadian rhythms of uraemia, which was higher 00h00-04h00 compared to all other TODs. Contrarily, physiological uraemia was reported to be lower at this TOD (00h0004h00) and higher between 08h00-14h00 [40]. The current finding showed that the circadian rhythm of glycaemia was upregulated by the COVID-19 infection only in female patients. Physiological glycaemia is higher during the beginning of the active phase of the day [43], which was true only for male patients in the current study (i.e. higher glycaemia between 08h00 and 12h00). However, glycaemia was higher between 00h00 and 04h00 in female patients. Although the origin of this upregulation is not clear, it could be associated with the inflammation-induced fever. Actually, it has been reported that a 1 C increase in core body temperature requires a 10%-12% increase in metabolic rate [41]. Taken together, these findings strengthen the fact that the SARS-Cov-2 infection disrupted circadian rhythms regulation, probably via circadian gene expression channels [36,44]. Contrary to the strong relationship between the time of hospital attendance and the age of the patient, the TOD of hospital attendance was not related to the sex of the patients. Actually, the sex-based difference in SpO2 persisted in the current study, with females showing higher SpO2 compared to males, similarly to earlier reports [45]. Moreover, males showed higher erythrocytes level compared to females at different TODs, similarly to physiological haematocrit concentration reported elsewhere [46]. This could be indicative of a negligible effect of sex in regard to SARS-Cov-2 infection.",1.0,COVID-19,True

196,"The current findings could be of relevance in the understanding of the temporal pattern of the COVID19 pandemic. Patients attend health care centres at different TOD and for various reasons. Whether the presentation at a particular TOD has an effect on their overall outcome during the disease process is a key question. Identifying such times will help clinicians to prioritize, escalate, and manage such patients appropriately so that they receive the best possible outcome for their condition. Also, adjusting staffing numbers in health centres when more patients are present could be helpful in dealing more effectively as well as help improve efficiency whilst dealing with the challenges of this pandemic.",1.0,pandemic,True
197,"To the authors' finest knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the diurnal variations in symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Diurnal variation in symptoms of cold and influenza has been reported in the literature [11]. Although the current results showed that COVID-19 patients' hospital admission is influenced by the TOD, the findings do not conclusively support that COVID-19 symptoms follow the same circadian pattern. First, the CT was not influenced by the TOD. Second, the time of viral infection may have affected the time of clinical presentation in these patients [11], which is beyond the scope of this study. Besides, the relatively long incubation period of SARSCoV-2 makes it difficult to identify retrospectively the onset time of infection. Indeed, the causal relationship between TOD and COVID-19 remains unclear and still to be explored. Furthermore, a longitudinal follow up of patients' vitals and the development of their symptoms would be very helpful to a better understanding of this pandemic. No exclusion criteria were applied in the current study, which could limit the current assumptions. In addition, there was no control group (e.g. patient attending the healthcare centre for other reasons) in the current study. Indeed, the lack of comparison could lead to biased conclusions. Thus, further studies on larger scales could generate a better understanding of the relationship.",1.0,COVID-19,True
