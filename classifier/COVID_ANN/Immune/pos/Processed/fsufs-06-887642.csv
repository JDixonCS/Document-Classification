40,"The microbiome innovation has resulted in an umbrella term, postbiotics, which refers to non-viable microbial cells, metabolic byproducts and their microbial components released after lysis. Postbiotics, modulate immune response, gene expression, inhibit pathogen binding, maintain intestinal barriers, help in controlling carcinogenesis and pathogen infections. Postbiotics have antimicrobial, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties with favorable physiological, immunological, neuro-hormonal, regulatory and metabolic reactions. Consumption of postbiotics relieves symptoms of various diseases and viral infections such as SARS-CoV- . Postbiotics can act as alternatives for pre-probiotic specially in immunosuppressed patients, children and premature neonates. Postbiotics are used to preserve and enhance nutritional properties of food, elimination of biofilms and skin conditioning in cosmetics. Postbiotics have numerous advantages over live bacteria with no risk of bacterial translocation from the gut to blood, acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes. The process of extraction, standardization, transport, and storage of postbiotic is more natural. Bioengineering techniques such as fermentation technology, high pressure etc., may be used for the synthesis of di erent postbiotics. Safety assessment and quality assurance of postbiotic is important as they may induce stomach discomfort, sepsis and/or toxic shock. Postbiotics are still in their infancy compared to pre- and pro- biotics but future research in this field may contribute to improved physiological functions and host health. The current review comprehensively summarizes new frontiers of research in postbiotics.",1.0,disease,True

44,"According to microbiome researchers, every individual has a distinctive set of microbiota, determined by their DNA and environment. During delivery and lactation, the infant is first exposed to microorganisms (Ursell et al., 2012). The species of microbiome found in the maternal GI flora decides the type of microbiome exposure to the infant. Various factors e.g., genetics, environment, type of delivery, medication and food plays an important role in determining the microbiota inhabiting the colon.",1.0,,True

49,"These exposures create a unique microbiome milieu varying from one individual to another individual. Later on, these exposures can change microbiome species which may be either beneficial or detrimental to health (den Besten et al., 2013). Several researchers have suggested various health-promoting effects of gut microbiomes which are dependent on the viability of bacteria. These processes lead to alteration of the gut microbiota, attachment to mucosa and epithelium host cells, improved epithelial function and immune-modulation (Sanders, 2009; Bermudez-Brito et al., 2012; Vyas and Ranganathan, 2012). However, recent research shows that neither all mechanisms nor clinical benefits are directly related to bacterial viability. Thus, viability of microbiome is not essential to attain the health-promoting effects of pre-probiotics. This led to the further research, development and use of nonviable components of microbiome for health benefits. Therefore, current evolving terminologies being added to probiotic scientific literature are postbiotics, ghost probiotics, synbiotics, nutribiotics, para probiotics and pharmabiotics. This paper reviews postbiotics which are non-viable intact microorganisms, their subcellular fractions and metabolic products secreted by live bacteria during their growth or released after bacterial lysis which add nutritional and health advantage to the host wellbeing (Salminen et al., 2021). Diverse antimicrobial compounds are produced that fall into two categories of low molecular weight (i.e., hydrogen peroxide, carbon dioxide, and di-acetylene) and high molecular weight (i.e., bacteriocins and bacteriocins-like substances) compounds which are known as postbiotics (Suskovic´ et al., 2010; de Almeida Júnior et al., 2015). Lactobacillus is the most researched bacteria among the various LAB (Lactic acid bacteria) which is used for production of postbiotics.",1.0,clinical,True
50,"Another major aspect in postbiotics research is their inherent stability, both during industrial processes and storage. As postbiotics are not able to replicate, thay are safer than probiotics. Thus, they are unable to cause probiotic associated risks like bacteraemia, fungaemia etc. (Yelin et al., 2019). Postbiotics are characterized by the microorganisms used as the starting point for its production and also the inactivation procedure or technique used for its production, as each procedure affects the quality and quantity of the final postbiotic produced & results in a different postbiotic with varied effects. However, for wider acceptance of postbiotics, an expert consensus is needed on the exact definition of postbiotics. The International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement unlocked the mystery of postbiotic action by five mechanisms: modulation of the resident microbiota; enhancement of epithelial barrier functions; modulation of local and systemic immune responses; modulation of systemic metabolic responses; and systemic signaling via the nervous system (Salminen et al., 2021). Therefore, postbiotics research in humans and validation of",1.0,trial,True
51,"clinical & non clinical benefits of these bioactive molecules is the need of the hour. Novel postbiotics formulation may open a new horizon resulting in new therapeutic and preventive clinical approaches in diseases like diabetes mellitus, wound healing, adjunctive therapeutic drug as well as in food biopreservation, food packaging, biofilm control, functional food, food supplements, pharma food etc. To summarize, postbiotics research unfolded the concept of microbial metabolites in the sustenance of health.",1.0,clinical,True
52,Concept of postbiotics,0.0,,False
53,"In 2019, ISAPP convened a panel of experts specializing in nutrition, microbial physiology, gastroenterology, pediatrics, food science and microbiology to review the definition and scope of postbiotics (Yelin et al., 2019; Salminen et al., 2021). The panel defined a postbiotic as a ""preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confers a health benefit on the host"". Effective postbiotics must contain inactivated microbial cells or cell components, with or without metabolites, that contribute to observed health benefits (Yelin et al., 2019). Their beneficial effect can be judged or confirmed in humans, animals, and other target organs and should not be limited only to the intestine. Further, the panel concluded that postbiotics are deliberately inactivated microbes that may contain metabolites or cell components exhibiting health benefits. Furthermore, there must be confirmed local as well as systemic health benefits, on the target population which can include humans, companion animals, livestock and other targets. Excluding injections, postbiotics can be administered anywhere at a host surface provided they have a safe profile. However, purified microbial metabolites and vaccines were excluded from postbiotics definition. Postbiotic may not necessarily be derived from a probiotic.",1.0,vaccine,True
54,"Various researchers reported beneficial effects of postbiotics such as immunomodulatory, antimicrobial and anti-cancer activity. It causes reduction in inflammation, oxidative stress, proliferative properties, reduction in blood pressure, cholesterol level and body weight. Postbiotics are well-tolerated in healthy people. However, certain groups of people should avoid increasing their level of postbiotics through eating probiotic rich foods e.g., people who have recently had surgery, have structural heart disorders, with digestive tract disorders, pregnant females and children. These groups tend to have compromised immune systems and may therefore be at an increased risk of an adverse reaction.",1.0,,True

60,"postbiotic and internal factors like the resident microbiota, enzymes, and various food components can inhibit metabolites functions (Rad et al., 2020). Proteolytic enzymes are associated with postbiotic dysfunctions (Izuddin et al., 2020; Humam et al., 2021). The most important proteolytic enzymes are pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin etc., which have been shown to interfere with the activity of postbiotic compounds. External food factors like hydrogen ion concentration of food alters the antimicrobial activity of postbiotics, the optimal activity of postbiotics being reported between pH 4 and 9. Out of the food types used in postbiotics research, pasteurized milk and ground meat have an optimal pH, therefore they cause no disturbance in the function of postbiotics (Moradi et al., 2020). Another external factor affecting the antimicrobial activity of postbiotics is temperature variation. Heat at 30C for 30 min or at 121C for 15 min, decreases the antimicrobial effect of postbiotics (Mirnejad et al., 2013). Therefore, temperature and pH control is critical for the production of postbiotics.",1.0,,True
61,"The concept of postbiotics is fairly recent in comparison to prebiotics and probiotics. Postbiotic supplements are not as extensively available yet but postbiotics are superior to probiotics because of their purity, ease of preparation, long shelf life, mass production capability, precise action and more targeted responses by specific ligand-receptor interactions (Nataraj et al., 2020). Therefore, researchers are using postbiotics to modulate microbial signatures of health, nutrition and disease status.",1.0,disease,True

63,"Over trillions of microbes carrying more than 3 million genes are estimated to inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract (GI), the main site being the large intestine that carry the most diverse and metabolically active microbial community (Belizário and Napolitano, 2015). The microbial colonization of the fetus seems to start in the uterus through ingestion of amniotic fluid and continues even after birth constituting the human microbiota (microbiome) unique to an individual (Tanaka and Nakayama, 2017; Toda et al., 2019).

64,"The gut microbiome of an individual shows family inheritance and comprises both beneficial and harmful microbes. A very delicate balance exists between the two and any disturbance in this normal microflora (dysbiosis) not only affects the GI tract but also negatively impacts the functions of other organs. This increases the risk of various infections and chronic diseases like colon dysfunction, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, autism, psychiatric disturbances and other metabolic problems (Carding et al., 2015).

66,"There are a number of investigations suggesting that the beneficial effects of probiotics in health may not necessarily be related to microorganisms' viability. Many of the health benefits of pre-, pro- and syn-biotics appeared to be mediated by various metabolic products, cellular and subcellular structural components and intact or ruptured dead microbes. Postbiotics are the structural and metabolic microbial products that include cell free supernatants, bacterial lysates, cell wall fragments, teichoic acid, short chain fatty acids, vitamins, enzymes, exopolysaccharide, various peptides, amino acids, and fermentation by-products (Wegh et al., 2019). These postbiotics components are produced by probiotics on feeding on prebiotics, during their prolonged storage or processing like pasteurization, baking or during metabolic processes. Besides these can also be produced in the lab by using methods such as radiations (UV/ionizing), high pressure, high temperature, sonication and inactivation by formalin.",0.0,,False
67,"Number of yeasts and bacteria used as probiotic but their use as postbiotic is underexploited. As postbiotics provide a safe alternative to live probiotics, the focus in recent time has shifted on postbiotics studies. Probiotic yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii has been used in many functional foods including dairy foods, grains, coffee, fruit juices etc. However, researchers need to develop postbiotic based functional foods preparations of S. boulardii, which may possibly improve shelf stability, sensorial properties, safety, and health benefits (Chan and Liu, 2022). Researches are being conducted to isolate and characterize different postbiotic components employing advanced technologies and to investigate their bioactivities for futuristic therapeutic use in medicine (Pyclik et al., 2020). Metabolomic methods are nowadays used to estimate the metabolic products of microbiota in stool and serum (Zhao et al., 2017). Many commercial pharmaceutical products like Nyaditum resea (inactivated Mycobacterium), Lacteol (inactivated Lactobacillus sp.), Cytoflora (cw components of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium sp.) are already approved for their use as supplements, immunomodulators and controlling risk of infections (Barros et al., 2020).",1.0,,True

There is no interaction of postbiotics with the food matrix, no risk of acquiring antibiotic resistance genes and also no undesirable changes in taste and aroma. So postbiotics are a safe substitute in individuals with immune deficiencies, with transplantation or for newborns. Postbiotics act both locally and/or systematically on other organs through the communication axis between gut and target organs like Gut brain axis, Gut lung axis, gut-liver axis (Nataraj et al., 2020).

It consists of teichoic acids, polysaccharides and proteins. Teichoic acids are negatively charged molecules present only in Gram positives and are grouped into two types; (i) wall teichoic acid and (ii) lipo teichoic acids on the basis of their anchoring to peptidoglycan and cell membranes, respectively (Swoboda et al., 2009).

These vary in their molecular weight, structure and activity and have been classified into three classes: heat stable Class I Bacteriocins/Lantibiotics (e.g., nisin, mersacidin, lacticin) that are modified highly after translation; heat stable Class II-bacteriocins (lactacin F, lactococcin G, pediocin PA-1, sakacin A) that are not modified much posttranslationally; and heat-labile Class III bacteriocins (colicins, megacins, enterolysin, helveticin I) (Negash and Tsehai, 2020). Bacteriocins show their potential in food preservation. Nisin was the first bacteriocin that was given approval by regulatory authorities like European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), FDA, Health Canada for its commercial use as food preservative and now it is being used in more than 80 countries as a food additive. Bacteriocins inhibit growth of pathogens in GIT through pore formation in cell membranes, inhibiting correct cell wall formation and inhibiting enzyme activity and protein functions.

It further demonstrated that biofilm reduction of L. monocytogene is brought about by bacteriocin and organic acid-based postbiotics. Therefore, postbiotics are utilized as an agent for the reduction of biofilm formation by pathogens in the food sector (Homayouni Rad et al., 2021).

330,"The human skin provides the first-line defense against external agents and acts as a physical and immunological barrier. Aggravation of skin diseases causes dysbiosis of the microbiome on the skin. In patients with acne there is a change in microbiota, which is dominated by C. acnes and S. epidermis. Scientific evidence indicates that use of topical probiotics reduces the number of acne causing bacteria like S. epidermidis, S. aureus, S. pyogenes and C. acnes (Lee et al., 2019). Bacteriocin from E. faecalis SL-5 containing lotion was found to reduce the inflammation in acne lesions.
