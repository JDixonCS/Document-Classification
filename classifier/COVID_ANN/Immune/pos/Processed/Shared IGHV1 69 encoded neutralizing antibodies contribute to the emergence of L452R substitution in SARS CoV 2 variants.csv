16,"SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge facing established herd immunity. L452R, previously featured in the Delta variant, quickly emerged in Omicron subvariants, including BA.4/BA.5, implying a continued selection pressure on this residue. The underlying links between spike mutations and their selective pressures remain incompletely understood. Here, by analyzing 221 structurally characterized antibodies, we found that IGHV1-69-encoded antibodies preferentially contact L452 using germline-encoded hydrophobic residues at the tip of HCDR2 loop. Whereas somatic hypermutations or VDJ rearrangements are required to acquire L452-contacting hydrophobic residues for non-IGHV169 encoded antibodies. Antibody repertoire analysis revealed that IGHV1-69 L452-contacting antibody lineages are commonly induced among COVID-19 convalescents but non-IGHV1-69 encoded antibodies exhibit limited prevalence. In addition, we experimentally demonstrated that L452R renders most published IGHV1-69 antibodies ineffective. Furthermore, we found that IGHV1-69 L452-contacting antibodies are enriched in convalescents experienced Omicron BA.1 (without L452R) breakthrough infections but rarely found in Delta (with L452R) breakthrough infections. Taken together, these findings support that IGHV1-69 population antibodies contribute to selection pressure for L452 substitution. This study thus provides a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 variant genesis and immune evasion.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

20,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global health concern. Since the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a number of Variants of Concern (VOCs) or Variants of Interest (VOIs) have emerged, including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.429 (Epsilon), and BA.1.1.529 (Omicron BA.1) [1]. Analysis of their spike sequences identified that K417, L452, E484 and N501 within the receptor binding domain (RBD) are mutation hotspots and numerous substitutions have been observed at these locations among variants.

L452R was first observed in B.1.427/B.1.429 variants which were dominant in California between November and December 2020 [4]. Studies on Delta variant found that L452R mutation reduced neutralizing activities of 14 out of 34 isolated RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).

28,"Omicron subvariants BA.2.12.1, BA.2.13, and BA.4/ BA.5, respectively [7], indicating active substitution events at this site. It is currently understood that although mutations are result of error-prone viral replication, dominant variants were selected for transmission advantages. It is conceivable that population immune pressure established from prior infections or vaccinations plays crucial roles in driving virus evolution [8], and variants with ability to evade population antibody responses would possess a considerable transmission advantage.",1.0,transmission,True
29,"To help understanding virus evolution, it is therefore important to analyze the prevalence of antibody lineages that are shared among the human population. Variants of SARS-CoV-2 bear mutations that allow escape from neutralization by different classes of antibodies, especially those belonging to classes widely distributed in the human population [9]. Previously, we and others have reported that IGHV3-53-encoded neutralizing antibodies are commonly elicited by SARSCoV-2 infection and they share similar binding mode to RBD [10-12]. It has been identified that recurrent mutation K417N abolishes neutralization by this class of shared antibodies [12]. Similar to K417N, L452R has been also recurrent in various VoCs. However, it is unclear whether the appearance of L452 substitution is related to the immune pressure of share neutralizing antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2. In this report, we identified that IGHV1-69 gene encodes antibodies of 3 major clonotypes and these antibodies are widely induced in vaccinees or convalescents of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain (wildtype, WT). We identified that IGHV1-69 antibodies preferentially recognize L452 using preexisting hydrophobic residues at the tip of heavy chain complementary determining region 2 (HCDR2) of germline IGHV1-69 gene. By antigen binding and virus neutralization experiments, we confirmed that L452R can specifically evade binding and neutralization by many IGHV1-69 antibodies. We provide evidence that IGHV1-69-encoded L452contacting mAbs are differentially recalled in Delta and Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infections, further revealing L452R's ability to impair immune memory recall in addition to evasion of physical antibody binding. These findings point to an immune selection pressure for L452R mutation contributed by IGHV169-encoded neutralizing antibodies. The findings reported here facilitate better understanding of SARSCoV-2 variant genesis and will help rationalize consequences of immune evasion by generated variants.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

Given that sequences highly similar to IGHV1-69-encoded RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies were widely identified in a broad COVID-19 patient population, we speculate IGHV1-69-encoded RBD-targeting antibodies are likely involved in SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity, and L452R substitution is likely evolved to counteract IGHV1-69-encoded neutralizing antibodies shared among population.",1.0,contact,True

76,"We further investigated structurally characterized antibodies and their interactions with L452 by computing buried surface areas (BSAs) at 452. We found that IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs generally bury more surface area at 452, followed by IGHV3-11, IGHV330, and IGHV1-2 (Figure 2(A)). Of note, the EUA mAb LY-CoV555 has the highest BSA at L452 and another EUA mAb CT-P59 ranks 4th (Figure 2(A)). Both antibodies have been shown to be escaped by the Delta variant [2]. The mean BSA for residue L452 in IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs is 39.8±8.2 Å2, by comparison, the mean BSA for residue L452 in IGHV1-2, IGHV3-30, IGHV3-11, and other IGHVsencoded mAbs is 14.3±8.6 Å2, 25.9±11.7 Å2, 31.2",1.0,area,True
77,"±14.5 Å2, and 25.1±14.5 Å2, respectively (Figure 2 (B)). This result suggests IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs likely have a preference for L452 recognition. Next, we compared binding modes of the L452-contacting mAbs. The 14 IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs segregated into two groups, one comprised of mAbs (LYCoV555, MW01, MW05, DH1043, S2D106, DH1042, BG1-24, C548, and XGv282) that targeted an ACE2-competitive site and the other containing mAbs (47D11, JMB2002, FC08, R1-32, and 52) that recognized a non-ACE2 competitive region (Figure S2B). We found that most ACE2-competitive IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs share similar binding modes approaching RBD with similar angles. NonACE2-competitive mAbs FC08, R1-32, and 52 also share similar binding mode. The conserved motifs in HCDR3s of the different clonotype appear to play a key role for RBD engagement and probably determined antibody binding mode (Figure S2C). However, importantly, we identified that whether they are ACE2-competitive or not these IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs share a common feature in L452 recognition (Figure 2(C), Figure S2B). Except for mAb C548, all the other 13 IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs use HCDR2 hydrophobic residues to interact with the L452 formed hydrophobic patch (Figure 2(C)). Of note, these hydrophobic residues represent a conserved feature on the tip of IGHV1-69 HCDR2 loop (positions 54, 55) and are encoded by IGHV1-69 germline alleles (Figure 2(C), Figure S3A). In contrast, no conserved hydrophobic residue was observed for IGHV1-2, IGHV3-30, IGHV3-11 or other IGHVs encoded mAbs to interact with L452, albeit hydrophobic contact serves as the most common mode of L452 interaction. Non-IGHV1-69 antibodies contact L452 by somatically mutated residues (e.g. N54I (2-15, S2M11), N54V (C121), and S56F (BD-667)) (Figure 2(C)) or by HCDR3 residues generated from VDJ recombination (e.g. V98 (CV05-163), V104 (75, A19-46.1, P2B-2F6), Y106 (CT-P59), L103 (278), and I100b (1-57)) (Figure 2(C)). Even though some somatic mutations were observed in HCDR2 loops of the characterized IGHV1-69-encoded antibodies including I54V (MW01), I54M (BG1-24, S2D106, 52, DH1042), L55I (FC08), and L55V (XGv282), all these were mutations between hydrophobic amino acids (Figure S3(A,B)). Among the 69 structurally characterized L452-contacting mAbs, only the IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs possess multiple hydrophobic residues at the tip of HCDR2 loop. Hydrophobicity analysis of all the human IGHV germline genes revealed that the IGHV1-69 (19 alleles) is the only human heavy-chain gene that encodes hydrophobic residues at the tip of HCDR2 loop (Figure S3C), indicating L452 binding can be achieved by germline IGHV1-69 antibodies without requiring somatic hypermutation.

Further analysis found that the sensitivities of these L452-contacting mAbs to L452R are negatively correlated with their BSAs at L452 (Figure S4B). This observation explains why most IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs are sensitive to L452R because they have a higher BSAs at L452 (Figure 2(A,B)). Consistent with the decreased binding affinities to L452R, the tested IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs also exhibited reduced neutralization of L452R bearing B.1.617.2 variant (Delta) (Figure 3(C)), with an average reduction of 19 folds (Figure 3(D)). Next, we investigated whether these IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs are affected by Omicron (without L452 substitution) or its subvariants (with L452X substitution). By pseudovirus-neutralization assay we showed that ACE2-competitive mAbs, LY-CoV555, MW01, and DH1043, are generally sensitive to both Omicron and its subvariants. However, the non-ACE2-competitive mAbs, R1-32 and FC08, are relatively insensitive to Omicron and BA.2.13 (with L452M) but more sensitive to BA.2.12.1 (with L452Q) and BA.4/BA.5 (L452R) (Figure S4C).

To answer this question, we first investigated the germline usage of 618 RBD-targeting mAbs isolated from COVID-19 vaccinees in CoVAbDab [26]. Consistent with primary SARS-CoV-2 infection, IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs are highly enriched in COVID-19 vaccinees similar to IGHV353/3-66 and IGHV3-30 mAbs (Figure 4(A)), indicating similar RBD-specific antibody induction between vaccination and natural infection.

Unlike Delta breakthrough infection, Omicron BA.1 (without L452 substitution) breakthrough infection massively induced IGHV1-69encoded antibody clones, representing with 11.65% (2nd most frequent) of 309 Omicron RBD-reactive mAbs [15,16] (Figure 4(A)). Structural analysis showed that two IGHV1-69-encoded Omicron RBDreactive mAbs Omi-2 and Omi-31 that isolated from Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection shared the same binding mode with those isolated from primary SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain infection (Figure 4(B), Figure 2(C), Figure S2B).

91,"Sequence analysis showed that IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs isolated from vaccination and Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection but not from Delta breakthrough infection are highly similar with the structurally characterized L452-contacting mAbs encoded by IGHV1-69 (Figure S6A). Notably, most of the IGHV1-69-encoded clones isolated from Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection utilize IGLV1-40 lightchain gene and have a preferred length of 17 aminoacid HCDR3s and a GYSGYG/D-like motif, which are related to our previous reported R1-32-like antibody lineage (non-ACE2 competitive) that isolated from primary SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain infection or vaccination (Figure 4(D), Figure S2A, Figure S6B). By reanalyzing the binding affinity data [16], we found that the IGHV1-69-encoded clones isolated from Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection showed around 10-fold reduced binding affinity to the Delta variant (Figure 4(C,D)). Structural analysis revealed that the epitope residues of R1-32-like mAbs (R1-32 and FC08) are not affected by mutations in Omicron BA.1, whereas most of ACE2-competitive IGHV1-69 mAbs largely interact with E484 (Figure S6B). We showed by ELISA that ACE2-competitive IGHV1-69 mAbs, LY-CoV555, MW01, and DH1043, are generally sensitive to E484 mutations (Omicron BA.1 has E484A) but the non-ACE2-competitive IGHV1-69 mAbs, R1-32 and FC08, are relatively insensitive to the E484 mutations (Figure 4(E)).

In this respect, IGHV1-69 antibody response is different to IGHV3-53/3-66 responses that even though Omicron variants contain the K417N mutation, IGHV353/3-66-encoded antibodies (also a shared antibody response) could be recalled following Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection with some recalled mAbs showing K417N resistance [15].

109,"While preparing this manuscript, we noted that L452 in the current circulating Omicron sub-variants is undergoing continued evolution. L452Q, L452M, and L452R have been identified in BA.2.12.1, BA.2.13, and BA.4/BA.5, respectively. Our analysis and existing report [16] showed that Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection massively recalled the wildtype-induced non-ACE2 competitive L452-contacting mAbs encoded by IGHV1-69. The biased induction of non-ACE2-competitive IGHV1-69 antibodies especially the R1-32-like antibodies in Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection likely enhanced selection pressure for L452 substitution. These IGHV1-69 mAbs showed cross-reactivities to both wildtype and Omicron BA.1 viruses, but are heavily escaped by L452R. Consistent with our results, Cao et al., recently found that the FC08 and other R1-32-like IGHV1-69 class of mAbs (e.g. BD-380, BD-421, BD-901, C091, XGv-271) are sensitive to L452X mutations using high-throughput yeast-display-based deep mutational scanning (DMS) assays [7].

For example, broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the E2 antigenic region 3 (AR3) of HCV are mainly derived from IGHV1-69 [32,33]. IGHV1-69 has been also identified as one of the major classes of antibodies against the Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) stem region [34,35]. In these studies, it has been demonstrated that IGHV1-69 germline-encoded HCDR2 hydrophobic residues are essential for HCV and Influenza epitope recognition [31], consistent with our finding on IGHV1-69encoded SARS-CoV-2 S-specific antibodies. Therefore, a recurring theme emerges that hydrophobic epitopes of diverse viral envelope glycoproteins can be preferentially recognized by germline-encoded hydrophobic residues at the tip of the HCDR2 loop of IGHV1-69-encoded antibodies. Such class of antibodies can be readily produced by multiple individuals, representing an immunological solution in response to emerging pathogens, and demonstrating an evolutionary advantage for primates to possess the IGHV1-69 gene [36].
