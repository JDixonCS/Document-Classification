11,"ABSTRACT Objective New-­onset immune-­mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) and flares of pre-e­ xisting IMIDs have been reported following anti- SARS-­CoV2 vaccination. Our study aimed at describing a retrospective cohort of patients developing new-o­ nset IMIDs or flares of known IMIDs within 30 days after any anti-­SARS-­CoV2 vaccine dose. Methods We evaluated clinical records of all inpatients and outpatients referring to our institution between February 2021 and February 2022 with any clinical manifestations. We then selected those having received any anti-S­ ARS-­CoV2 vaccine dose within the prior 30 days and classified them as having or not a previous IMID according to predefined criteria. We recorded new-­onset IMIDs or flares of known IMIDs and investigated any relationship with demographic, clinical and serological variables. Results 153 patients that received any anti-­SARS-­CoV2 vaccine dose within the previous 30 days were included of which 45 (29%) already had a diagnosis of IMID while 108 (71%) had no previously diagnosed IMID. 33 (30%) of the 108 patients, were diagnosed with a new-­onset IMID. Pericarditis, polymyalgia rheumatica and vasculitis were the most frequent conditions. Among the 45 patients that already had an IMID, disease flare was the reason for referral in 69% of patients. Patients with an IMID flare had a lower number of comorbidities and tended to be younger compared with those who developed other conditions after anti-­SARS-­CoV2 vaccination. Conclusion We provided a retrospective overview of a cohort of patients who developed new-­onset IMIDs or flares of known IMIDs within 30 days after any dose of anti-S­ ARS-­CoV2 vaccine. While vaccination campaigns proceed, postvaccination surveillance programmes are ongoing and hopefully will soon clarify whether a causal relationship between vaccines and new-o­ nset/flares of IMIDs exists.",1.0,disease,True

26,"the safety of these vaccines has been collected. As of 21 June 2022, 24 vaccines are currently in use4 and 11 912 594 538 vaccine doses have been administrated worldwide.5 Among the available compounds developed using different platforms, mRNA-b­ased (BNT162b2, mRNA-­ 1273) and adenovirus vector (ChAdOx1, Ad26.COV2.S) vaccines are those most broadly used and adverse reactions to SARS-C­ oV2 vaccination have been reported in association with both types of vaccines. Besides mild self-­limiting adverse events such as injection site pain, some other adverse events raised concerns in the scientific community and in the public. In March 2021, the European Medicines Agency described a worrisomely high number of cases of thrombocytopaenia associated with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis after the administration of the ChAdOx1 vaccine. A pathogenic mechanism similar to heparin-i­nduced thrombocytopaenia was postulated and the subsequent demonstration of circulating anti-­factor 4 (PF4)-heparin antibodies confirmed the autoimmune nature of this vaccine-­induced condition.6 Vaccine-­induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia (VITT) was subsequently described also in association with mRNA-b­ased vaccines alongside other vaccine-­induced immune-m­ ediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) such as autoimmune liver diseases and IgA nephropathy among others.7-9 However, whether the association between anti- SARS-C­ oV2 vaccine and new-­ onset IMIDs is causal or coincidental is still a matter of debate.10",1.0,vaccine,True

28,"METHODS Patient cohort Clinical records of all inpatients and outpatients referring to either our Internal Medicine and Nephrology ward or our Immuno-­Rheumatology service at the University of L'Aquila, Italy, between February 2021 and February 2022 were reviewed. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were in accordance with WHO guidelines for surveillance of adverse events following immunisation11 which represent a rationale question-­based process to identify the eligible cases (online supplemental figure S1). In particular, the entry criterion for the study was having received any anti-­ SARS-C­ oV2 vaccine dose within the prior 30 days. Then we classified the included patients as IMID or no-I­MID according to the following criteria: no IMID patients had neither a prevaccination diagnosis of IMID nor a prevaccination clinical suspicion of IMID leading to specific laboratory and clinical assessment. Among IMID patients, those with a flare who discontinued or reduced for more than 30 days the immunosuppressive therapy prior vaccination were excluded.",1.0,Clinical,True

A new-o­nset IMID was diagnosed in 33 (30%) of the 108 patients. However, when assessing the data according to the setting, new-­onset IMID were diagnosed in 13/88 (15%) inpatients and 20/20 (100%) outpatients (table 1). None of these 33 patients had familiar history of IMID.

In addition, we observed numerical differences, although not significant, with regard to the clinical picture that occurred after the first or second dose of the regular vaccination schedule. In fact, in about half of the patients who experienced a disease flare it happened after the first dose and in about 30% after the second dose.

406,"The main mechanisms through which anti-S­ ARS-­CoV2 vaccine may trigger autoimmunity include molecular mimicry, the production of autoantibodies and the role of vaccine adjuvants.10 As demonstrated for other vaccines such as human papilloma virus and influenza, the cross-­ reaction between viral proteins and tissue auto-­antigens may lead to the development of an aberrant autoimmune response by means of molecular mimicry. However, the low incidence of vaccine-i­nduced IMIDs underscores the importance of genetic predisposition to facilitate the disease development only in a small subgroup of vaccinated people. This process may also occur with regard to anti-S­ ARS-­CoV2 vaccine due to the similarity of SARS-C­ oV2 proteins and tissue antigens. With regard to the production of autoantibodies, VITT represents an example of antibody-m­ ediated vaccine-i­nduced IMID that deserves to be discussed. Initially believed to pertain only to adenovirus vector vaccines, VITT was subsequently described also in association with mRNA-­based vaccines.7 Patients with VITT display antibodies targeting PF-­4 and mediating their effect through IgG-­FcR interactions and complement activation.12 13 Of interest, however, vaccine induced anti-­PF4 do not cross-­react with the SARS-­CoV2 spike protein.14 Finally, vaccine adjuvants as well as the mRNA included in vaccines may trigger autoimmunity via the inflammasome pathway being recognised by toll like receptors.15 On this basis, anti-­SARS-­CoV2 vaccine-­ induced IMIDs represent a challenge for clinicians since the interaction between the vaccine and the immune system needs to be fully elucidated while patients may develop not only fully blown IMIDs but also autoimmune features not fulfilling the available classification criteria.",1.0,vaccine,True

In addition, a case report from Manzo et al also described new-­onset PMR after the administration of the first dose of an mRNA-b­ ased vaccine.18 Conversely, in our cohort all cases of PMR occurred after the third vaccine dose and all patients had received mRNA-­based vaccines.",1.0,clinical,True

In fact, during acute SARS-C­ oV-­2 infection vasculitis may be induced by direct endothelial damage. As mentioned above, ChAdOx1 vaccine can induce anti-P­ F4 antibodies and therefore interfere with the endothelial/coagulation homoeostasis.19 With regard to autoantibodies, it is important to mention that none of the three patients developing thrombocytopaenia in our cohort (two of which after ChAdOx1 vaccine) displayed anti-­PF4 antibodies but rather they tested positive for antiplatelet antibodies hence being diagnosed with autoimmune thrombocytopaenia.",1.0,vaccine,True
414,"Arthralgia is rather common after any anti-­SARS-­CoV2 vaccines, occurring in up to 30% of people.25 26 Arthritis is less frequent; however, it is not necessarily a red flag for a subsequent diagnosis of IMID. In fact, reports of new-­onset chronic inflammatory arthritis are scarce and mainly pertain to rheumatoid arthritis (RA).27 It is important to mention, however, that since RA autoantibodies may occur years before the clinical phase of the disease, it is not possible to rule out whether anti-­ SARS-­CoV2 vaccine induced only the articular manifestations or also a seroconversion.",1.0,vaccine,True
