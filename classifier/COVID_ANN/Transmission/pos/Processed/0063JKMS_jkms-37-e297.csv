24,"The global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) has created a major global health concern. At the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2, the World Health Organization designated pregnant women as a vulnerable group based on preliminary studies, which reported poor obstetric and neonatal outcomes of previous outbreaks of respiratory virus infections, including SARS,1,2 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS),3,4 and influenza.5",1.0,pandemic,True
25,"The anatomical, physiological, and immunological changes that occur during normal pregnancy can have systematic effects, which make pregnant women more likely to develop complications from respiratory tract infections.6,7 However, the available data are insufficient and inconsistent to infer the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women in terms of obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Although critical illness was relatively uncommon in both groups, the maternal and obstetric outcomes appeared to be worse in pregnant women, compared with that in non-pregnant women with COVID-19.8,9 Pregnant women will not only develop a more severe form of COVID-19 but also experience pregnancy-related complications such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, and stillbirth.9-16 However, other studies reported that with COVID-19 pregnant women have less severe consequences than those with other coronavirus infections such as SARS or MERS.17 Furthermore, the severity of COVID-19 in pregnant women is similar to that in non-pregnant women.13,14,18-28",1.0,respiratory,True
26,"In the Republic of Korea (ROK), a previous nationwide study using claims data suggested that the prevalence of COVID-19 was lower in pregnant women (0.02%) than in nonpregnant women aged 20-44 years (0.14%) from January 2020 to February 2021. The medical insurance systems in the ROK that cover all Korean citizens include the National Health Insurance (97%) and the Medical Aid program (3%), which provide easy access to medical institutions. In the ROK, at the beginning of this pandemic, all pregnant women with COVID-19 were admitted in order to receive intensive and careful management. Data concerning the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women in Korea's differentiated healthcare environment is extremely scarce. This fundamental information is essential to assess the clinical benefits and risks of COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Even in three other studies conducted in the ROK, pregnant women with COVID-19 were not at higher risk of developing a severe disease,26,27,31 which was similar to the results of previous studies conducted outside of the ROK.13,14,18-25,28",1.0,Disease,True
402,"With regard to the use of therapeutic agents in pregnant women, remdesivir and corticosteroids were administered in 14.8% and 23.7%, respectively, and even those with mild diseases were prescribed these medications. The United States Food and Drug Administration assigned remdesivir and corticosteroids to pregnancy risk category B and C, respectively. Patients with severe cases included in our study were more likely to receive remdesivir or corticosteroids than those with mild cases. According to the COVID-19 treatment guidelines developed by the National Institutes of Health, the therapeutic management of pregnant patients with COVID-19 should be the same as that of nonpregnant patients.32 However, the benefit-risk balances in each single case should be considered when selecting a specific drug for the treatment of COVID-19 in pregnant patients.33",1.0,disease,True

The mode of delivery did not lead to the vertical transmission of COVID-19 or did not affect the neonatal outcomes.34-36 The selection of mode of delivery may have been based on the hospital infection control status and medical condition of pregnant women in addition to the previous history of cesarean delivery, failure of labor to progress, breech presentation, and premature rupture of membranes.34,37-39",1.0,area,True

In the recent study, 1.8% of newborns of pregnant women with COVID-19 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-qPCR, and 1% experienced antenatal and intrapartum transmission.40 The study suggested that the severity of maternal COVID-19 seemed to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in neonates.40",1.0,transmission,True
405,"In this study, the Apgar score was higher in newborns of mothers with severe illness compared with newborns of mothers with mild illness. However, the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores of most newborns were 7 to 10; hence, no further intervention was provided. Only 6 neonates had a 1-minute Apgar score of 5 or 6, and were equally distributed in the mild and severe groups. Furthermore, the incidence of transient tachypnea of newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, and neonatal pneumonia was not different between the two groups, and none of the neonates died. Based on the results of this study, the disease severity of pregnant women with COVID-19 did not affect the neonatal outcomes.",1.0,respiratory,True
406,"Our findings demonstrated that pregnant women with COVID-19 with a gestational age of  21.5 weeks and a history of childbirth were more likely to progress to severe COVID-19. In previous studies, the severity of COVID-19 in pregnant women at  20 weeks of gestation or",1.0,COVID-19,True

411,"This study has some limitations. First, although the data were collected from 15 hospitals, only some of the data from the study population were included in the analysis as a small sample size. Therefore, the interpretation of the results is limited, and our findings may have limited generalizability. Second, the severity of pregnant women with COVID-19 was possibly overestimated because the data were collected from a tertiary medical institution. Third, the vaccination status of pregnant women was not investigated in this study. However, COVID-19 vaccination was initiated in the ROK from October 18, 2020. Until December 2021, only 9.8% of pregnant women were vaccinated against COVID-19 in the ROK. Therefore, the maternal outcomes associated with COVID-19 vaccination did not significantly affect the results of this study. Finally, this study was conducted on patients with COVID-19 prior to the outbreak of omicron variant. The subjects included in our study are presumed to be mainly related to the wild type, the alpha variant, and delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Hence, our results were difficult to apply in those infected with omicron variants.",1.0,COVID-19,True
412,"To the best of our knowledge, this multicenter cohort study was the first to investigate the maternal, obstetric, and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 according to disease severity in the ROK. In conclusion, the present study showed that outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 were similar to those of non-pregnant women, but they were at higher risk of progression to severe disease. In pregnant women with COVID-19, the probability of vertical transmission is extremely rare, but attention should be paid to the obstetrical complications according to severity of the patient's clinical condition. Hence, the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women should be clarified by conducting a nationwide prospective cohort study. These fundamental data will contribute to optimized allocation of scarce resources and formulation of rational healthcare policies to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.",1.0,COVID-19,True
