8,"Background Regular repeat surveillance testing is a strategy to identify asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infections in high-risk work settings to prevent onward community transmission. Saliva sampling is less invasive compared to nasal/oropharyngeal sampling, thus making it suitable for regular testing. In this multi-centre evaluation, we aimed to validate RT-PCR using salivary swab testing of SARS-CoV-2 for large-scale surveillance testing and assess implementation amongst staff working in the hotel quarantine system in Victoria, Australia.",1.0,asymptomatic,True
9,"Methods A multi-centre laboratory evaluation study was conducted to systematically validate the in vitro and clinical performance of salivary swab RT-PCR for implementation of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing. Analytical sensitivity for multiple RT-PCR platforms was assessed using a dilution series of known SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, and assay specificity was examined using a panel of viral pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we tested capacity for large-scale saliva testing using a four-sample pooling approach, where positive pools were subsequently decoupled and retested. Regular, frequent self-collected saliva swab RT-PCR testing was implemented for staff across fourteen quarantine hotels. Samples were tested at three diagnostic laboratories validated in this study, and results were provided back to staff in real-time.",1.0,clinical,True

31,"In Australia, the first wave of COVID-19 was characterised by multiple incursions of SARS-CoV-2 from returning travellers with limited onward transmission.3 Conversely, until widespread community transmission of the Delta and Omicron variants in late 2021 and early 2022, outbreaks of COVID-19 were largely attributed to transmission from residents within quarantine to hotel staff or fellow residents. Most notably, infection of hotel quarantine staff in the state of Victoria, Australia in mid-2020 led to over 10,000 COVID-19 infections in a large second wave in Victoria.4 Following this outbreak, major changes were made to the hotel quarantine system; these included limiting staff employed in the hotel quarantine system from working across other settings, and improved infection control practices.5 In addition, systematic surveillance testing of staff working in the hotel quarantine system was proposed as a means of early detection of possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from hotel quarantine residents to staff.6",1.0,COVID-19,True

39,"Setting and study population We performed a retrospective observational study assessing the implementation of salivary RT-PCR testing in hotel quarantine workers in the Victorian capital city of Melbourne (population 4.97 million), Australia. Between March 2020 and November 2021, returning international travellers to Victoria were required to undertake fourteen days of supervised quarantine in designated quarantine hotels. Following the second wave of COVID-19, in Victoria in mid-2020 the hotel quarantine system was managed by COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria (CQV), an agency responsible for overseeing the quarantine programme. As part of this programme, there was a dedicated workforce and daily testing of on-site staff on each day they attended work, with additional voluntary paid testing through community sites on days not attending work. On-site testing was a mix of saliva swabs and combined nasal/oropharyngeal swabs, with the majority of samples being saliva swabs, but at least one sample per week being a nasal/ oropharyngeal swab. There was also voluntary regular testing of staff family members. International arrivals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were transferred to a dedicated quarantine hotel (""health hotel"") managed by Alfred Health, a public healthcare service in Melbourne. To assess the performance of saliva swab RTPCR for surveillance testing in this programme, we conducted a multi-centre in vitro and clinical validation study, led by the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) at the Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity (Melbourne, Australia).

128,"Here, we describe the development and implementation of large-scale salivary RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Melbourne, Australia. Following the second wave of COVID-19 in Melbourne, the hotel quarantine worker testing programme was implemented in December 2020 to coincide with the return of international travel into Melbourne.6 Specifically, the purpose of the testing programme was to prevent incursions of SARS-CoV-2 from returning travellers, via hotel quarantine staff, into the Australian community. In order for widespread surveillance testing to be successful, both the sampling and laboratory testing aspects needed to be scalable, tolerable and accessible. To address this requirement, we developed and implemented a self-collected salivary swab RT-PCR testing method for use across a range of testing platforms and in multiple laboratories.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
129,"In our study, the clinical sensitivity of saliva swab testing compared to nasal/oropharyngeal swabs on individuals within seven days of symptom onset was 84.5% (95% CI 68.6 to 93.8), in keeping with other published work.16,17 Although the sensitivity of saliva testing using swab-based collection is less than that of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs, likely due to factors such as sample dilution and differential viral tropism, previous studies have suggested that increasing the frequency of testing using less sensitive testing approaches may offset the reduction in sensitivity compared to nasal/oropharyngeal RTPCR testing.18,19 As such, high-frequency testing was useful in low disease prevalence settings.19,20 Salivary swab RT-PCR is ideally suited to frequent sampling as it is non-invasive and is amenable to self-collection. Further, because most laboratory workflows using commercial testing platforms are adapted for handling swabs, swab-based saliva testing is suitable for scaling up across diagnostic laboratories, compared to handling neat saliva specimens. Moreover, we found that using pools of four saliva swab samples demonstrated minimal loss of sensitivity and was an effective strategy to increase testing capacity. Other recent studies have used larger pool sizes for salivary RT-PCR surveillance; for example, Mendoza et al. utilised pools of up to 24 neat saliva samples for surveillance testing in schools in New York, allowing testing of over 250,000 saliva specimens over a 20-week period.11 Similarly, Joachim et al. used pooled salivary swab samples from school children in Germany, employing one or two pooled testing groups per class.21 However, one of the key aims of testing hotel quarantine staff is early identification of",1.0,clinical,True

131,"Since the commencement of the hotel quarantine saliva RT-PCR surveillance programme, approximately 500,000 saliva swabs have been tested in Victoria, with salivary RT-PCR testing validated and deployed at multiple laboratories. Further, salivary swab surveillance testing has subsequently been utilised in other settings in Australia. For example, salivary swab testing was used in the management of the Australian Open international tennis tournament in January 2021 and was extended to surveillance testing of healthcare workers who provide direct care for patients with COVID-19.22 In the healthcare setting, early detection of spread from patients to healthcare workers may prevent onward transmission in both the hospital and community.23,24",1.0,quarantine,True
132,"Our study has several limitations. We were unable to collect information on potential false positive and false negative results from all laboratories. However, as part of risk management for the salivary RT-PCR programme, we developed an algorithm to facilitate rapid confirmatory RT-PCR testing by repeat nasal/oropharyngeal swab testing. This algorithm helped to ensure that all positive results obtained using salivary swab testing were confirmed using nasal/oropharyngeal swab RT-PCR testing, thus helping mitigate the risk of false positives, and allowing rapid confirmation of true positive results. In addition, we did not conduct a specific cost-benefit analysis of the salivary swab RT-PCR testing, although work is ongoing in our setting to assess the overall cost-effectiveness of the programme.",1.0,positive,True
133,"For most of 2020 and 2021, Australia relied heavily on strict public health measures (including localised lockdowns), and closure of the international border to maintain comparatively low morbidity and mortality rates due to COVID-19.2 Until the emergence and spread of the Delta, and subsequently Omicron variant in Victoria and New South Wales (the country's most populous states), Australia had several periods of successful elimination in 2020 and 2021.4,5 However, to meet the testing demand required for re-opening, scalable and accessible testing approaches became necessary to complement conventional nasal/oropharyngeal RT-PCR, including accessible rapid antigen testing and pooled salivary RT-PCR testing.",1.0,COVID-19,True
