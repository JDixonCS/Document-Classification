Staff workload decreased when sufficient resources were allocated to implement OCs and patients used them for simple problems or could describe their queries using free text. Staff workload increased when OCs were not integrated with other software or organizational workflows and patients used them for complex queries.

25,Background,0.0,,False
26,"Online consultation (OC) systems allow patients to contact their health care provider over the internet to ask health-related questions and report symptoms [1]. Their query may then be resolved with a written response, telephone call, video consultation, or in-person visit. Many terms are used to describe this type of technology, including e-consultation, e-visit, and online triage (Multimedia Appendix 1 [2-28])--in this review, we refer to them all as online consultations. We distinguish OCs from ""symptom checkers"" [29] and other self-service systems that typically do not directly facilitate communication with a human health care provider and from patient portals [30], which may include generic email or secure messaging functionalities.",1.0,contact,True
27,"OCs are considered by policy makers in many countries as a way to address the increasing workload and decreasing workforce capacity in primary care [31-36] while still meeting patient expectations and improving access [37]. However, they have the potential to exacerbate health inequities [38,39] and increase inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions [40]. Furthermore, there are widely recognized challenges in initiating and sustaining the adoption of new technologies in primary care [41].",0.0,,False
28,"Although symptom checkers [29,42] and patient portals [30,43,44] have been well studied, only a small number of evidence syntheses directly relevant to OCs have been published: a systematic review of 57 articles on delivering ""e-consultation"" in primary care largely focused on generic stand-alone applications such as email and video (n,""39/57, 68%) [45]; a scoping review of """"online triage tools"""" included 13 papers, 4 of which (31%) were nonempirical (eg, opinion pieces) [46]; and a review of 17 studies of """"intelligent online triage tools"""" focused only on those that used """"artificial intelligence"""" (AI) [47].""",0.0,,False

34,"Given this rapid scale-up and increase in the diversity and complexity of OCs, further insight is needed into their impact on health care quality. Previous reviews have not reported the design or implementation details of the OCs they studied [45-47] despite their importance in understanding the causal mechanisms of how they affect care outcomes [65].

53,"For objective 2, we considered OC ""design"" as material properties of an OC, such as features and functionality [74], and ""implementation"" as the way an OC was introduced and used in a particular context [65]. As a design feature, we considered AI as the ability of machines to ""mimic human intelligence as characterized by behaviors such as cognitive ability, memory, learning, and decision making"" [82]. We synthesized the extracted data using framework analysis [83], which involved SD and TC reading and rereading each data extraction form and then coding them line by line independently--both deductively by using domains from the NASSS framework [74] for high-level themes and inductively by identifying additional subthemes. Through discussion, SD and TC summarized the findings into five high-level themes: condition complexity (health condition and the illness the OC is used for), technology (material properties of the OC and required knowledge for use), adopters (staff, patients, and carers expected to use the OC), organization (extent of work needed for implementation of the OC, capacity, and readiness), and wider system (policy context) [74]. Two NASSS domains--value proposition (value of the OC to the developer, patients, and health care system) and embedding and adaptation over time (learning and adaptation to changing contexts)--had limited applicability to our findings and were not included in the final synthesis. Informed by realistic evaluation [65], we considered our themes as contextual factors and identified patterns of explanations for how each led to the impacts on care quality from objective 1 (ie, ""causal mechanisms""). Where appropriate, we considered the levels of OC adoption as a mechanism for how they affected care quality [65]. We used visual mapping to identify commonalities and discordances in causal mechanisms--first within individual papers and then across papers [83]. Where there were discordances, we explored potential explanations where possible (eg, related to the study setting).",1.0,,True

308,"In total, 52% (33/63) of the studies suggested that the workload decreased for both staff and patients when using OCs. Patient queries were written rather than spoken, incoming phone calls to receptionists were reduced [16], and patient histories did not need manual documentation [93]. Written queries were usually more detailed than when communicated verbally and were received by health care staff asynchronously, thus providing opportunities for more objective examination and more effective triage. Consequently, patient queries could more often be directed to other services or dealt with by other staff members rather than always by physicians [3]. Combined with their remote nature, OCs also gave staff more autonomy over how their work was organized, thus providing efficiency gains such as working from home and control over how to contact a patient rather than defaulting to an in-person consultation [13]. When telephone or in-person consultations were necessary, they were more focused and, therefore, quicker as the staff member could read the patient query before contact [17]. OCs reduced the workload for patients by avoiding the need to telephone their primary care provider to make an appointment, which often entailed long queues [18], and avoiding in-person consultations when possible, which typically involved travel, waiting rooms, and organizing time off work and childcare [15].",1.0,contact,True
309,"In contrast, 46% (29/63) of the studies suggested that OCs increased the workload for staff and patients. Staff described conducting OCs on top of their usual tasks [13] and dealing with them outside normal working hours [19]. They believed that, because OCs increased access to primary care, patients sought help more readily than they would have previously [17], thus creating ""supply-induced demand"" [108]. Processing OCs also created new administrative work such as filing them to EHRs and deciding whether they required input from a clinician [86].

Simple queries included those related to administrative tasks, new and recurrent minor acute illnesses, prescriptions, tests, requests for advice, follow-up, and some chronic condition reviews [56]. These queries also decreased health costs as they saved clinicians time, for example, when administrative staff were able to relay messages and there was no direct contact between physician and patient [23]. In all, 11% (7/63) of the studies suggested that OCs increased staff workload and costs when used for complex queries such as those with multiple ill-defined symptoms [17].

353,"Consistent with previous reviews relevant to OCs, we found a limited demographic of patients using OCs, leading to potential inequitable care [45,46]. We also found that the studies often did not sufficiently explore patients' perspectives of OCs in depth [46]; only 14% (9/63) of the studies used interview-based methods with an average sample size of 24.5 (SD 10.14). This hampered efforts to understand how such inequities arose.",0.0,,False
354,"Contrary to previous reviews, we found that OC impacts on care quality are more complex and nuanced than previously reported [45-47]. For example, we identified mixed findings regarding their impact on workload, patient satisfaction, and equitable care. This contrasts with previous reviews, where OCs only increased [47] or had no impact [45] on workload, decreased patient safety [45,47], and increased inequity [45-47].",0.0,,False
355,"These new findings for OCs may be partly explained because 76% (48/63) of the included studies had not been covered by these previous reviews. Although there was some overlap of papers (7/57, 12% of papers [45]; 7/13, 54% of papers [46]; and 4/17, 24% of papers [47]), most did not meet our inclusion criteria as they were either nonempirical (4/57, 7% [45]; 4/13, 31% [46]; and 4/17, 24% [47]), published before 2010 (26/57, 46% [45] and 2/17, 12% [47]), not based on real-world primary care (16/57, 28% [45]; 1/13, 8% [46]; and 6/17, 35% [47]), or did not meet our functional definition of an OC (39/57, 68% [45]; 2/13, 15% [46]; and 6/17, 35% [47]; eg, symptom checkers with no link to a health professional [28]).",0.0,,False
356,"By focusing on design and implementation, we identified new ways in which OCs affect primary care quality. For example, we found that, by increasing access, OCs can increase staff workload by creating ""supply-induced demand"" [17,108] and that they can decrease workload by enabling more focused consultations [17]. Furthermore, as previous reviews often did not analyze the design or implementation of OCs [45-47], we identified influential factors that have not been previously described. For example, although some reviews identified increased workload when clinicians received insufficient patient information via an OC system [46], we found that this was particularly associated with MCQ-based OCs [23]. We identified",1.0,flu,True

Combined with our focus on causal mechanisms, this helped us develop a new and theoretically informed understanding of OCs that has not been previously reported.",0.0,,False
360,"As in all systematic reviews, our synthesis is reliant on what the study authors reported. OC features were not always described in sufficient detail to understand how they affected care quality [62]. There was also a lack of patient perspective in the studies, particularly from OC nonusers [4]. We made our literature search strategy as inclusive as possible regarding the different terms used for OCs (Multimedia Appendix 1) but, owing to their wide-ranging nature, it is possible that some papers were missed. We updated our searches between November 2021 and February 2022 to capture more recently published studies but, owing to time constraints, only 1 author (SD) screened these newer papers.

Some of these are unintended and conflict with the promotion of OCs by policy makers as a way to address already increasing workload and decreasing workforce capacity in primary care [31-36]. Unlike previous evidence syntheses on the topic, we have shown that negative impacts on care quality of OCs can be mitigated through appropriate system design (eg, free text formats and two-way written communication), incorporation of advanced technologies (eg, AI), and integration into technical infrastructure (eg, EHRs) and organizational workflows (eg, timely responses).
