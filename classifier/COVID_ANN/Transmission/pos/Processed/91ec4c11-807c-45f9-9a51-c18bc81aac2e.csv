14,"Originated from Wuhan, China in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has emerged as a significant threat to public health, and has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), with 8 061 550 cases and 440 290 deaths occurring worldwide as of 17th June 2020 (World Health Organization a. 2020).

15,"With the rapid surge in the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2, WHO emphasized the urgent need to coordinate international collaborative efforts to minimize the threat in all affected countries in order to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19 (World Health Organization c. 2020). While the battle against COVID-19 is ongoing, multiple measures have been taken by governments in an effort to slow down and mitigate viral transmission of the respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 in the local population such as",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

When formulating a health policy, key front-line workers within multi-disciplinary teams should be a part of the policy planning to ensure that these policies function effectively (Park et al. 2015). Indeed, government health education messages represent a key source of information for citizens for promoting their self-protective practices against respiratory infectious diseases. These preventive messages generally emphasize improved hygiene, face-mask use and social distancing measures, including avoiding crowds during epidemics (World Health Organization. 2009; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2010; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. 2020). Although the decision-making and application of such measures by governmental bodies is essential for the control of a pandemic, the level of awareness and adherence of citizens to control measures is also crucial for the successful application of the aforementioned measures.",1.0,social,True
18,"In the absence of an effective vaccine, public implementation of PPMs is fundamental. WHO has recommended five main PPMs against COVID-19: hand hygiene, social distancing measures, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, practice of respiratory hygiene and self-isolation (World Health Organization d. 2020). Another recommendation by WHO also suggests that citizens should follow advice given by their healthcare provider or their national and local public health authorities in order to obtain information from a reliable source. The level of public adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 and it directly impacts the trajectory of the outbreak in a country. This is particularly valid during outbreaks which, due to their evolving nature and inherent scientific uncertainties, can be associated with considerable fear in the general public, especially if illness or death rates are high (Person et al. 2004). This was a phenomenon observed during the SARS outbreak in 2003, where studies conducted suggest that the level of panic emotions in the population is directly associated with their knowledge and attitudes towards the infectious disease (Hung 2003).",1.0,vaccine,True
