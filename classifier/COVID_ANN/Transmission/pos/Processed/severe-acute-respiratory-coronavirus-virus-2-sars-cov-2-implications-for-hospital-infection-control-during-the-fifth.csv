5,Abstract We obtained 24 air samples in 8 general wards temporarily converted into negative-pressure wards admitting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) omicron variant BA.2.2 in Hong Kong. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 19 (79.2%) of 24 samples despite enhanced indoor air dilution. It is difficult to prevent airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals.

6,"Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) omicron variant in November 2021, it became the dominant variant circulating globally. The evolving SARS-CoV-2 omicron sublineages from (BA.1 to BA.2 to BA.4 to BA.5) have demonstrated progressively increased transmissibility,1 leading to explosive outbreaks in the community.2 Whether the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant increased the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission in the healthcare setting remains uncertain. Recent studies have shown that the universal use of surgical respirators as a component in infection prevention contributed to the rapid control of SARS-CoV-2 omicron transmission in the hospital.3 Universal use of surgical respirators in the healthcare setting was also advocated when the infection rate of COVID-19 in community was high.4 The preliminary findings of surgical respirator use in the SARS-CoV-2 omicron era may provide an indirect implication of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant in the clinical areas.",1.0,respiratory,True

Detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the air samples were significantly associated with more COVID-19 patients in wards, patients with higher viral load using Ct value as surrogate, and longer duration of air sampling by univariate analysis. These are reasonable findings because more COVID-19 patients in the ward with higher viral load would result in exhalation of more virusladen aerosol. However, viral load in our air samples was low, probably because of the installation of mobile modular high efficiency particulate arrestance filter units (MMHUs) and exhaust fans in the windows to improve the indoor air dilution (Fig. 1).",1.0,COVID-19,True
98,"The finding of SARS-CoV-2 dispersal in the NPWs may have an impact on hospital infection control, especially in general wards or other clinical areas where the indoor air dilution is not as good as AIIRs or NPWs. Asymptomatic COVID-19 patients may spread the virus in these areas via airborne route, which may result in outbreaks. Prolonged exposure to COVI9-19 patients may have an increased risk of infection. This factor was indirectly implied in our multivariable analysis in which the duration of air sampling was negatively correlated with the Ct value of air samples. The use of surgical respirators by HCWs may protect them from acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 and may minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 dispersal from infected HCWs. However, discomfort would increase over time with continual respirator use at work,9 making universal use of surgical respirator not practical, especially during a nonoutbreak period. In addition, it is impossible to eliminate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 dispersal from infected patients. Although surgical masks can be provided to all patients, compliance may not be 100%.10 The MMHUs cannot be installed at all wards because of its large size. Enhancement of indoor air dilution by installation of MMHUs could not eliminate the virus, as shown in our study. Therefore, it is difficult to prevent airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals. Promulgation of COVID-19 vaccination is the key to protect patients and HCWs from developing severe infection when transitioning from the pandemic to endemicity.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

Given the finding of air dispersal of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 would be possible. We did not perform virus isolation for the air samples.
