8,"The novel Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020, impacting the lifestyles, economy, physical and mental health of individuals globally. This study aimed to test the model triggered by physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection, in which the need for health information and perceived impact of the pandemic mediated the path sequentially, leading to adverse mental health outcomes. A cross-sectional research design with chain mediation model involving 4612 participants from participating 8 countries selected via a respondent-driven sampling strategy was used. Participants completed online questionnaires on physical symptoms, the need for health information, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The results showed that Poland and the Philippines were the two countries with the highest levels of anxiety, depression and stress; conversely, Vietnam had the lowest mean scores in these areas. Chain mediation model showed the need for health information, and the perceived impact of the pandemic were sequential mediators between physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection (predictor) and consequent mental health status (outcome). Excessive and contradictory health information might increase the perceived impact of the pandemic. Rapid COVID-19 testing should be implemented to minimize the psychological",1.0,Coronavirus,True

17,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. As of December 4 2020, the number of confirmed cases was 65,528,133, the number of death cases was 1,511,726 and the number of recovered cases was 45,371,073 w­ orldwide1. While one may not necessarily contract COVID-19 during this time, certainly, his or her mental health is likely affected due to financial ­burden2, occupational injury due to potential risk of ­infection3 as well as the loss of livelihoods and ­opportunities4. The COVID-19 pandemic has become an urgent issue on global mental health and an unprecedented challenge for healthcare systems of all ­countries5.

18,"A study of the early-stage COVID-19 pandemic in China found anxiety in 6.33% and depression in 17.17% of 600 ­respondents7. In other Asian countries, a new questionnaire, i.e., the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, was developed in ­Iran8, but this questionnaire did not measure other psychiatric symptoms such as depression. In Pakistan, mental illness poses a significant challenge to its under-resourced health care s­ ystem9. In Italy, the healthcare system stretched to its limit because healthcare workers constituted10% of Italy's confirmed COVID-19 c­ ases10 As a result, recent guidelines recommended all healthcare workers should receive psychological support based on coping strategies for managing ­stress11. In Europe, the levels of psychiatric symptoms were generally low at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, younger Spanish individuals with chronic diseases reported more symptoms than the rest of the ­population12. In the United States (US), Asian Americans were less likely to report psychiatric symptoms than Caucasian Americans during the COVID-19 p­ andemic13. Studies from China, Italy, Germany and Russia identified protective and risk person factors for mental health during COVID-19. Risk factors for adverse mental health include younger a­ ge14, especially young people who had to work outside their ­domicile15, reduced ­income14, family member infected by COVID-1915, having chronic ­diseases14, concerns related to COVID-19 infection for themselves or family m­ embers14, living a­ lone14, having family c­ onflicts14. Protective factors for mental health include disseminating reliable ­information16 and personal confidence by mastering knowledge of the p­ andemic17.",1.0,COVID-19,True
19,"Researchers observed that mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety were affected by the ­pandemic18, but the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. Several behavioral theories could be applied to identify factors that influence mental health during the pandemic. One health behavior theory is the protection motivation theory developed by R.W. Rogers in 1­ 97519. According to this theory, the COVID-19 pandemic might trigger the threat-appraisal and coping-appraisal p­ rocesses19. The public would experience uncertainty and become very concerned about physical symptoms, which resemble COVID-19 infection. Due to the potential threat and impact of the pandemic, they would become worried that they did not have enough health information to protect themselves. For the coping-appraisal process, a person would search for health information to enhance understanding of the pandemic and take measures to reduce the risk of developing an i­nfection20. The information-buffer hypothesis suggests that health information could buffer against physical symptom threats, thus reducing anxiety, depression, and stress. On the contrary, the overload of health information, especially inaccurate and misleading information, might lead to adverse mental health outcomes. Recently, Amanzio et al. (2020) proposed a theoretical framework to explain the association between health information, the psychological impact of a pandemic, physical symptoms and mental health outcomes based on the nocebo phenomenon for the infectious ­disease21. During the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicting and inaccurate health information (e.g., contradictory advice on face mask use) could lead to negative thinking and ­expectation22, resulting in the nocebo ­effect21, which ultimately lead to adverse mental health ­outcomes23. In summary, the physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection would trigger the need to search for health information, affecting the perceived impact of the pandemic and ultimately adverse mental health outcomes (i.e., anxiety, depression and stress).",1.0,pandemic,True

Although the need for health information did not act as a mediator when considered alone, there was a sequential mediating effect in which physical symptoms was associated with the need for health information, which in turn associated with higher perceived impact of the pandemic, which in turn associated with adverse mental health outcomes (i.e., anxiety, depression and stress).",1.0,pandemic,True
164,"Based on research conducted before the pandemic, the normative data for DASS-21 are as follows: the mean depression score was 3.87, the mean anxiety score was 2.95, and the mean stress score was 4.8724. In this study, the mean DASS-21 scores of all countries were higher than normative data except Vietnam. For IES-R, the means IES-R scores reported by healthy citizens after witnessing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was 20.17.25. In this study, the mean IES-R scores of Chinese, Spanish, Polish, Iranian, American and Pakistani respondents were higher than healthy citizens witnessing CPR except for Filipino and Vietnamese. We observed that Pakistan and Poland were the two countries with the highest DASS-21 subscale scores. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Happiness Report ranked the countries that had the greatest improvement of happiness from 2005-2008 to 2016-2018 as follows: Philippines (+0.860), Pakistan (+0.703), Poland (+0.445) and China (+0.426)26. In contrast, United States (- 0.446), Iran (- 0.713) and Spain (- 0.793) showed reduction in happiness scores from 2005-2008 to 2016-201826. The COVID-19 pandemic might reverse the increase in happiness scores in Poland and Pakistan. Each country faced unique challenges during the pandemic. Respondents from Poland reported high DASS-21 stress, anxiety and depression scores. A recent Polish study found that loneliness was correlated with psychiatric symptoms and emotional response to physical health threat during the COVID-19 p­ andemic27. Furthermore, increased worry about the social isolation and concerns for financial problems was observed in lonelier ­Poles27. Additionally, the Polish media frequently reported that the healthcare system in Poland was not prepared to fight the pandemic, having to deal with staff shortages, deficit in medicine supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) for health personnel or hospital closures, which may have had an impact on the mental health of the P­ oles28. Pakistani respondents reported high levels of DASS-21 stress, anxiety and depression scores, which may be related to perceptions of an incomplete response to COVID-19 due to poor sanitation, lack of basic preventive measures, lack of proper testing and medical f­acilities28. Pakistani health professionals started protesting and threatened to quit work due to a lack of P­ PE28. The unpreparedness and contradictory policies resulted in an alarmingly high COVID-19 spread and worsening mental health of Pakistani people, although data collected on mental health was during the peak time of the COVID-19 spread in the country. Chinese respondents reported the highest IES-R scores. China was the first country to report COVID-19, but the Chinese people were also accused of not being transparent about the COVID-19 and spreading the virus across the ­world29. The editor-in-chief of The Lancet, Richard Horton expressed concern about discrimination or revenge actions toward China and C­ hinese30. Iran ranked second in terms of high IES-R and DASS-21 anxiety scores. The economic sanctions that prevented medical supplies, equipment and drugs from arriving in ­Iran31 could lead to anxiety among Iranians during the pandemic.",1.0,pandemic,True

166,"The current study is the first to demonstrate the mediation mechanism underlying the association between physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection and mental health outcomes. Based on the chain mediation model, physical symptoms were positively associated with higher anxiety, depression and stress. This result adds to previous studies that have suggested that real or perceived infection threats could lead to negative psychological ­reactions36, and people's anxieties were closely related to physical ­symptoms37. Experiencing physical symptoms that resemble COVID-19 infection could trigger ­hypochondriasis38, and a higher number of physical symptoms experienced could lead to strong disease ­conviction39. As a result, rapid diagnostic test development and implementation are crucial to alleviating adverse mental health outcomes when a person experiences physical symptoms similar to COVID-19 ­infection40. The uncertainty of potential threat during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic could trigger anxieties, depression and stress much more than f­ear38. The current study also identified the role of health information as a mediator in the link between physical symptoms and the perceived impact of the pandemic. During the strict lockdown, people were refrained from social ­interaction41 and spent more time at home and searching for health information online. Consistent with the protection motivation ­theory19, the need to search for more health information is triggered by activity in survival circuits that detects imminent threats of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the need for health information was not associated with adverse mental health outcomes, which might partially support the information-buffer hypothesis. The need for health information formed a sequential mediation path with the perceived impact of the pandemic on mental health outcomes. This finding is consistent with previous research about information-induced behavioral changes during the COVID-19 l­ockdowns42. Excessive health information might heighten the perceived impact of the pandemic through cyberchondria that is defined as the unfounded escalation of concerns about COVID-19 symptoms based on a review of search results and literature ­online43. According to the nocebo ­phenomenon21, conflicting health information (e.g., confused face mask policy)22, unproven conspiracy t­ heories44 and ­rumors45 also enhanced the negative impact of the pandemic. In contrast, people who were likely to less frequently accessed health information were less anxious, depressed and stressed, and worried about the p­ andemic46. Our findings confirmed the second path of the indirect effect: that physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection was associated with a higher level perceived impact of the pandemic and led to adverse mental health outcomes. This finding is consistent with previous research that symptoms of emerging infectious diseases might lead to stigma and adverse mental health o­ utcomes47.

172,"The findings of this first multi-national study have several implications on public mental health strategies. Firstly, Kaslow et al. (2020) proposed that community mental health strategies include providing support groups, participating in health education outreach and disseminating mental wellness ­guides48. Furthermore, mental health professionals should offer online psychological interventions such as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based therapy to improve the general population's mental h­ ealth49. The COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to introduce and promote telepsychiatry that overcomes the quarantine measures and geographical distance for mental health ­assistance50. Second, as physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection (e.g., headache, chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, coryza) were associated with adverse mental health outcomes, the lack of testing for coronavirus could worsen mental health. There is an urgent need to develop accurate, rapid diagnostic tests in general practitioners' clinics, community and rural ­settings51. For low income countries, coronavirus testing should be easily accessible and free. A negative COVID-19 test result for members of the general population who present with physical symptoms may alleviate anxiety, depression and stress. Third, based on our findings, the WHO, governments and health authorities should provide regular updates on health information including effectiveness of prevention strategies, therapeutics, and vaccines and treatment methods. The study results could contribute reference information to various countries that need to monitor public mental health status and provide accurate and consistent health information during the ­pandemic37.",1.0,community,True
173,"Limitations. This study has several limitations. The first limitation was that the study population had different sociodemographic characteristics as compared to the world population. The respondent sampling method also compromised the representativeness of samples. The study population was female predominant (proportion of female in the study population: 68.55%; world population: 49.58%)52 and a high proportion of the study population possessed a university degree (proportion of degree holders in the study population: 70%; world population: 7%)53. The second limitation was sampling and selection bias because we could not reach out to potential respondents without Internet access in both countries. There was an uneven number of participants among 8 countries because 1938 Vietnamese participants were excluded due to incomplete questionnaires, and a smaller number of Iranian participants were recruited due to lack of Internet access in some areas of Iran. The third limitation was the cross-sectional nature of this study. Although the chain mediation model contributes to our understanding of the mediational factors that might influence the association between physical symptoms and adverse mental health outcomes, it cannot verify the temporal relationship. A longitudinal study is required to verify the direction of the paths further. The fourth limitation was that we did not record demographic data regarding the pre-existing mental illness of the study participants. The fifth limitation was that self-reported psychological impact levels, anxiety, depression and stress may not always be aligned with objective assessment by mental health professionals. Nevertheless, the perceived impact, anxiety, depression and stress are based on personal feelings, and self-reporting was paramount during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sixth limitation was that we could not confirm whether participants were seropositive to COVID-19 at the time of the survey because it was an online questionnaire-based study. Another possible limitation was the different recruitment periods of participants for each country and we planned to study the impact of COVID-19 during the peak periods that varied from country to country. Lastly, we were unable to calculate the response rate. For potential respondents who were not keen to participate in the online survey, no response was recorded, and we could not collect any information from them.",1.0,area,True

Descriptive statistics were calculated to compare demographic characteristics, physical symptoms and health service utilization, contact history, knowledge and concern, precautionary measure and additional health information variables among 8 countries. One-Way analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared the mean IES-R and DASS-21 scores between 8 countries to determine whether the associated population mean IES-R or DASS-21 scores were significantly different. If there were significant differences among 8 countries, the Least Significant Difference (LSD) would calculate the smallest significance between mean scores of two countries with different combinations.
