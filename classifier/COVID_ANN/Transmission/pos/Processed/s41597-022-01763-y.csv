5,"SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), a virus causing severe acute respiratory disease in humans, emerged in late 2019. This respiratory virus can spread via aerosols, fomites, contaminated hands or surfaces as for other coronaviruses. Studying their persistence under different environmental conditions represents a key step for better understanding the virus transmission. This work aimed to present a reproducible procedure for collecting data of stability and inactivation kinetics from the scientific literature. The aim was to identify data useful for characterizing the persistence of viruses in the food production plants. As a result, a large dataset related to persistence on matrices or in liquid media under different environmental conditions is presented. This procedure, combining bibliographic survey, data digitalization techniques and predictive microbiological modelling, identified 65 research articles providing 455 coronaviruses kinetics. A ranking step as well as a technical validation with a Gage Repeatability & Reproducibility process were performed to check the quality of the kinetics. All data were deposited in public repositories for future uses by other researchers.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

7,"The first cases of coronaviruses disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in China in December 2019 and spread afterwards quickly around different countries from around January-February 20201. From the first months of viral dissemination, SARS-CoV-2 clusters were observed, in particular in occupational environments for several essential sectors such as health care centres2,3 or food processing plants4-7. The transmission of coronaviruses among humans was reported as possibly through aerosol (inhalation of aerosolized or falling contaminated droplets) or through contact (hand, objects or surfaces)8,9. Infected persons (symptomatic or asymptomatic) can send out several contaminated droplets that could stay in aerosol, be directly inhaled or fall on surfaces and potentially infect afterwards other persons. However, the changes of the infectious viral load in the contaminated droplets susceptible to be inhaled and to induce disease are not well known in either aerosol or surfaces. Furthermore, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 depends on environmental conditions that are very different from one occupational location to another10,11. Some factors such as airflow, ventilation, temperature and relative humidity modify the probability of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through respiratory pathways since it can affect droplet movements and virus survival, notably through droplet desiccation12. Some studies reported the influence of few temperature and/or relative humidity conditions. For example, the virus remains infectious for longer periods at lower temperatures and very high relative humidity10, metal surfaces such as stainless steel could allow the virus to remain infectious longer than on others under some specific temperature-humidity conditions13,14. Studies on coronaviruses persistence were generally conducted by experiments in laboratory consisting in monitoring the virus kinetics under controlled conditions. The reduction of virus infectivity over time could be evaluated by fitting inactivation mathematical models on experimental data. Studying the effects of environmental conditions encountered in food premises requires collecting kinetics data as exhaustively as",1.0,case,True

Firstly, a literature review to identify relevant publications presenting kinetics data was carried out. This research was based on a query of scientific bibliographical databases in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines15 (Step 1). The second step consisted in converting raw data from scientific publications (texts, tables or figures) into a ready-to-use numerical dataset with a manual collection for tables or a semi-automated collection after digitalization of figures (Step 2). Afterwards, an inactivation primary model was fitted on each kinetics to estimate the viral infectivity reduction parameter and its uncertainty (Step 3).

27,"Scoping review. The scoping review is part of a scientific project to describe the persistence of coronaviruses in food production environments. Firstly, a query process was carried out to identify relevant records, using weekly advanced searches on several topics associated with SARS-CoV-2. This weekly literature search was conducted between March 2020 and 25th August 2021 using a combination of keywords related to the main thematic (1) ""SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus"" joined by the logical connector AND with one of the following (2a) ""Human and food"", (2b) ""Water"" or (2c) ""Environmental persistence"". The keywords used for each theme are specified in Table 1. Studies were collected weekly from two bibliographic search engines PubMed and Scopus (from March 2020 to August 2021) and by query on Frontiers (from November 2020 to August 2021). A date restriction was defined: only publications from the 1st of January 2020 were collected. The search was limited to publications with abstracts written in English. The last query process using those above-mentioned criteria performed on the 25th of August 2021 identified overall 14,267 references exported to EndNote software, after duplicate removal. From this corpus, a thematic filter about ""Persistence"" was built with a ""from group"" tools in EndNote software. This filter consisted in selecting articles with ""persisten*"" ""survival"" or ""stability"" in the field ""Title-Abstract-Keywords"", joined by the logical connector AND with ""environment*"". This search resulted in 418 references.

272,"Evaluation of kinetics quality. In this work, kinetics data were collected from different publications in which the laboratory experiments were not conducted with the same design. These data represented then important variabilities, e.g. in terms of number of time points, replicates, etc. Therefore, criteria can be useful to evaluate and classify the quality of the collected kinetics. Indeed, the quality of raw data was susceptible to influence the statistical estimation of D. Criteria-based ranking approaches have been proposed in some predictive microbiology studies aiming to deal with difficulties in terms of data selection (inclusion or exclusion for modelling)83,84. Herein, for the establishment of a quality score by kinetics, we considered three criteria: (i) the number of the time points of the kinetics; (ii) the importance of the extracted point considering if it represented a single value or multiple measure (i.e. at least two technical replicates); and (iii) the value of the coefficient of variation (CV) of the estimated value of D, characterizing the fit quality of the inactivation model. For each kinetics, we attributed three scores corresponding to these three criteria and classified them into different categories. It is worth noting that ones can arbitrarily define the threshold values separating these categories as well as the given corresponding score values depending on the studies and the extracted dataset. In our work, for each kinetics, the score associated with the number of time points, denoted s1, was firstly defined as follows:",1.0,flu,True

In order to check the quality of the data collected by digitalization, this step was re-conducted repeatedly by three independent users for evaluating its repeatability and its reproducibility. This checking procedure was performed on a random sample of eleven kinetics among those collected, and each kinetics was digitalized three times per user. The values of the parameter D were afterwards estimated as described in previous sections. The comparison between the values of D estimated by different users was firstly done by fitting the major axis regression model on bootstrap data generated for each pair of users86,87. Afterwards, the Gage R&R tool from the R package SixSigma88,89 was used in order to identify and quantify the error parts in the estimated values of log_10 D due to the user repeatability as well as the between user reproducibility, respectively.

The results of the Gage R&R analysis showed a good repeatability: the latter estimated a very low error part due to intra-user variation, estimated at only 0.01% of the overall variation. The error part due to the between-users variation was estimated at 1.5%. After confrontation between experimenters, this part of inter-users error can be explained by the difficulties for choosing the points to be digitalized. Indeed points below the limit of quantification (LOQ) should not be included for avoiding bias.

The different groups of points can be assigned with user-defined group names in order to separate different kinetics from the same image if necessary. For each digitalized image, a digitalization file is automatically generated in a specific directory, denoted `caldat' to ensure the traceability of this manual step.
