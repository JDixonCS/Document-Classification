11,"COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). e increasing prevalence rate of the virus nearly devastated healthcare systems across the world [1, 2]. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease a global health pandemic. It is transmitted through inhalation of respiratory droplets from an infectious person emitted through sneezing, coughing, and having a close conversation, as well as contact with contaminated surfaces [3]. e infection prominently a ects the respiratory tract. e initial COVID-19 symptoms are fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Other symptoms include body aches and pains, a sore throat, diarrhoea, headache, loss of taste and smell, breathing di culties, skin rash, and discoloration of the",1.0,COVID-19,True

15,"Vaccination has been a major public health tool in modern medicine used to minimize the impact of many infectious diseases on humans [5, 6]. A vaccine is any biologically derived substance that elicits a protective immune response when administered to a susceptible host. Vaccines help the body to prepare for disease by taking the advantage of the fact that immunity knows how to defend against infectious organisms, which are typically viruses, bacteria, or toxins [7]. Given the emergence of highly transmissible new variants, decreased vaccine e ectiveness, and unequal vaccine availability, there is a growing concern that vaccination may not result in herd immunity. Vaccines reduce the risk of severe disease and death; therefore, a country's vaccine coverage must be high in order to protect the healthcare system from an infection surge [2]. Since late 2020, several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that are more transmissible and/or vaccine-resistant have been identi ed [8].",1.0,infectious,True

18,"In modern medicine, vaccination has been an important public health technique for reducing the burden of many human infectious diseases [5, 6, 9]. Several COVID-19 vaccine candidates have been developed and are already in use [10]. Vaccines such as Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sputnik, Sinopharm, Johnson & Johnson, and many others are currently being administered around the world to date. It is a social responsibility choice of an individual to get vaccinated. However, offsetting the fear and adverse side effects of the vaccine has to be carried out[11]. e shortage of supply of COVID-19 vaccines in many developing countries has resulted in the implementation of different immunization strategies, with varying results. For example, in Kenya, prioritization is given to the adult population [2].",1.0,infectious,True
19,"A mathematical model provides insight into infectious disease transmission and control [12, 13]. Many mathematical models on the dynamics of COVID-19 with control strategies have been developed and studied, for example, in studies carried out in [9, 10]. Optimal control is regarded as a powerful mathematical tool for optimizing control problems in various fields [14-18]. In the context of vaccination, the dynamics of disease transmission and immunity in a population are typically modelled by using network compartmental approaches [19]. A mathematical model for the dynamics of COVID-19 is presented in [18]. An optimal control function is added to the model in order to effectively control the outbreak. e main controls are isolation, quarantine, and hospitalization. e result shows that adopting the available control measures to their full potential will greatly reduce infectious populations.",1.0,infectious,True
20,"A new COVID-19 model with an optimal control analysis is presented in [20]. e authors considered four different controls to develop an optimal control model, including prevention, vaccination control, rapid screening of people who are exposed, and people who are infected without screening. e forward-backward Runge-Kutta method is used to resolve the model with and without control. e findings suggest that control can be useful for reducing infected individuals and improving population health. A novel fractional-order mathematical model that explains the behaviour of COVID-19 in Ethiopia is developed and analyzed in [21].
