5,"Abstract An online cross-sectional study was carried out to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among primary health care providers (PHPs) at three tertiary care hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan. Data was collected via email and online social media platforms. Statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 25.0 was used for data analysis. Among the total participants (n,""114), 74 (66.7%) were male and 37 (33.3%) were female. The mean scores for knowledge, attitude and practice were 12.7±0.89, 8.9±4.1 and 7.3±1.2, respectively. Most of the participants knew the term COVID-19 and its mode of transmission (90%), signs and symptoms (84%) and risk factors (72%) associated with it. Most of the participants agreed that COVID-19 can be transmitted through coughing and sneezing (74.3%) and 84.6% were in favor that COVID-19 can be prevented by adopting preventive measures. Around 68.8% of the participants disagreed with the use of antibiotics in the prevention of COVID-19. Ninety percent of the respondents were avoiding close contact with the people having cough and flu-like symptoms. Most PHPs had good knowledge, positive attitude and reasonable practices regarding COVID-19. Moreover, focused training programs for PHPs at the Government level can further improve their understanding of risks and preventive strategies related to COVID-19, which will help them to provide appropriate care to their patients as well as to protect themselves from this infection.""",1.0,coronavirus,True

The knowledge score was significantly different across the professions (p,0.003) and the hospitals (p,""0.007). Most of the respondents showed an optimistic attitude toward COVID19. The mean attitude score suggested that 80% of the respondents had a positive attitude toward the COVID-19 infection. The attitude toward COVID-19 significantly differed across the age (p<0.0001), profession (p<0.0001) and hospital (p"",""0.02). Despite this, the PHPs adopted good preventive practices regarding COVID-19. The mean practice score of 7.3±1.2, suggested that the preventive practices regarding COVID-19 among the PHPs were acceptable.""",1.0,COVID-19,True
310,"Knowledge greatly reflects the practice of individuals as it provides a base for good practice [10]. The knowledge of PHPs regarding COVID-19 is of paramount importance as they are on the frontline in dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak. The Physicians, Pharmacists, and Nurses are the professionals who are in direct contact with the COVID19 infected patients and they must be fully aware of the associated risks with this infection. In the presented study the correct knowledge response rate was 90%, this finding was consistent with studies conducted in China (90%) [1] and Kenya (88%) [9], but was higher than that of Jordon (40%) [11]. One study from China reported that 89.5% of the participants knew COVID-19 which was in line with our study [12]. The knowledge of the Iranian general population about COVID-19 was 87% which is consistent with our study [13]. Another study from China reported that 88% of the healthcare workers knew COVID-19 (knowledge score: 8.17±1.30), this finding was in line with our study [14].",1.0,COVID-19,True
311,"The present study demonstrated that most of the respondents showed a positive attitude toward COVID-19. Almost 80-90% of the respondents agreed that infection can be prevented by wearing masks, washing hands, using sanitizer and soap, restricting travel to infected areas, isolation of infected patients and avoiding touching nose, eyes, and mouth, which was consistent with studies reported from China (94%) [1] and Iran (90%) [13]. Another study from China stated that 93.3% of the participant agreed with the statements that COVID-19 transmission can be prevented by washing hands with soap frequently, isolation of COVID-19 positive patients and acceptance of isolation after getting COVID-19 (attitude score: 1.86±0.43, range: 1-4) which was in line with our findings [14].",1.0,positive,True
312,"The adaption of preventive practices is the only solution to defeat the COVID-19, as to date, there is no specific treatment and prevention for the novel coronavirus [15]. In the present study preventive practice adopted by the PHPs were appreciable. The majority of respondents often practiced thoroughly cooked food (92%), keeping themselves warm and hydrated (69.6%), avoiding close contact with the people having cough and flu like symptoms (76%) and wearing personal protective equipment during interaction with COVID-19 patients (88.4%). Most of the participants had performed hand hygiene before and after interaction with COVID-19 patients (99.1%). Almost 100% practiced social distance of one meter from patients and other healthcare workers. This figure was consistent with the reported studies from China, where 96% of the respondents were practiced preventive practices by avoiding crowded places and wearing masks [1] and Jordon, where 87.5% of the participants adopted preventive practice by washing hands with alcohol or soap, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and putting a mask on confirmed or suspected patients [11]. Another study from Iran reported that 89% of the participants practiced preventive measures regarding COVID-19 (mean±SD: 32.1±2.9, range: 12-36) these numbers are consistent with our study [13]. The good PHPs practices seen in this study may be attributed to the various directives issued by the Government Agencies and by the awareness campaigns ran on the social and electronic media.",1.0,COVID-19,True
