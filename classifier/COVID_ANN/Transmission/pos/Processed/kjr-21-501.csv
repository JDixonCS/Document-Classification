5,"From December 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia (formerly known as the 2019 novel Coronavirus [2019nCoV]) broke out in Wuhan, China. In this study, we present serial CT findings in a 40-year-old female patient with COVID-19 pneumonia who presented with the symptoms of fever, chest tightness, and fatigue. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. CT showed rapidly progressing peripheral consolidations and ground-glass opacities in both lungs. After treatment, the lesions were shown to be almost absorbed leaving the fibrous lesions.

8,"Since December 2019, cases of pneumonia with unknown causes have emerged in succession in Wuhan, China (1, 2). On January 7, 2020, it was identified as a type of novel coronavirus (Coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) by virus typing. By January 30, 2020, a total of 7700 cases were confirmed and 170 cases died (3). To date, there have been few reports of chest computed tomography (CT) findings of COVID-19 pneumonia patients (4). We report a confirmed case of COVID-19 pneumonia in a 40-year-old female. Written informed consent was waived by the Jiangxi Provincial People's Hospital Institutional Review Board.",1.0,case,True

10,"A 40-year-old female presented with a fever for 3-days, as well as chest tightness, and fatigue for 2-days was admitted to our emergency department. The patient was physically healthy before and had no underlying diseases. She did not travel to Wuhan city and denied any contact with patients with COVID-19 infection.",1.0,disease,True
11,"At admission, her body temperature was elevated to 38.9°C. Laboratory examinations showed normal leukocyte (4170/L), neutrophils (59.6%), and lymphocytes (30.9%). There was an increase in hematocrit (0.456) and glucose (7.3 mmol/L) levels. The initial chest radiograph, taken 3-days after fever onset, was normal in both lungs (Fig. 1A).

She was given antibiotics for symptomatic treatment.",1.0,area,True
12,"At first, the patient did not show any respiratory symptoms, however, on day 6 after fever onset, she began coughing.

Axial CT scan (B) shows GGOs in subpleural area of right lower lobe. Left lung is normal. C-E.

29,"Since December 2019, some hospitals in Wuhan have been suffering from pneumonia of unknown causes, later identified as a COVID-19 by the whole genome sequence analysis of the viruses in the respiratory samples from the patients (5). This coronavirus belongs to the  genus, which was named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (6, 7). Most of the initial cases had a history of exposure to the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan city, and some cases rendered a family clustering feature. The source of infection is still unknown, however it is speculated that the infection may have been caused by bats or vipers (8). The infection is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets. The median time from onset to admission to the hospital was 9 days, and most patients were between 40 and 60 years-old. The clinical manifestations are mainly fever, fatigue, and dry cough, with gradual dyspnea in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe cases (2, 3, 9). In this case, the patient had no clear history of contact with the epidemic area, and both the leukocytes and lymphocytes were normal, thus it was misdiagnosed as common pneumonia at first.",1.0,COVID-19,True
30,"In this case, the initial CT showed GGOs in the right lower lobe, the pathology of which may represent pulmonary edema or hyaline membrane formation (4). The density of the lesions is so subtle that it can hardly be depicted by conventional radiographs. Therefore, routine CT examination is recommended for the patients suspected of COVID-19",1.0,case,True
31,"to reduce missed diagnosis (1). CT findings of this patient include the short-term progression of lesions, multiple patchy consolidations and GGOs in both lungs, especially in the peripheral lung zones of the lower lobes, which may represent alveolar injury, cellular and fibrous exudation. After treatment, the consolidations and GGOs were almost absorbed, leaving fibrous cord-like shadows that represent fibrosis.",0.0,,False
32,"In conclusion, we report the serial CT findings in a female patient with COVID-19. Chest CT showed rapidly developing multiple patchy consolidations and GGOs in both lungs, which were mainly distributed in the peripheral areas. In the later stage, there may be a possibility of development of fibrosis. And with high-resolution CT, it will be easier to find GGOs in the early stage. The imaging findings of COVID-19 overlap with other viral pneumonia, therefore, nucleic acid tests are recommended for prompt diagnosis and treatment.",1.0,COVID-19,True
