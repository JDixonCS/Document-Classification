5,"Objective: To describe the experience of implementing a deep learning-based computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the interpretation of chest X-ray radiographs (CXR) of suspected coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients and investigate the diagnostic performance of CXR interpretation with CAD assistance. Materials and Methods: In this single-center retrospective study, initial CXR of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were investigated. A commercialized deep learning-based CAD system that can identify various abnormalities on CXR was implemented for the interpretation of CXR in daily practice. The diagnostic performance of radiologists with CAD assistance were evaluated based on two different reference standards: 1) real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) results for COVID-19 and 2) pulmonary abnormality suggesting pneumonia on chest CT. The turnaround times (TATs) of radiology reports for CXR and rRT-PCR results were also evaluated. Results: Among 332 patients (male:female, 173:159; mean age, 57 years) with available rRT-PCR results, 16 patients (4.8%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Using CXR, radiologists with CAD assistance identified rRT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients with sensitivity and specificity of 68.8% and 66.7%, respectively. Among 119 patients (male:female, 75:44; mean age, 69 years) with available chest CTs, radiologists assisted by CAD reported pneumonia on CXR with a sensitivity of 81.5% and a specificity of 72.3%. The TATs of CXR reports were significantly shorter than those of rRT-PCR results (median 51 vs. 507 minutes; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Radiologists with CAD assistance could identify patients with rRT-PCR-positive COVID-19 or pneumonia on CXR with a reasonably acceptable performance. In patients suspected with COVID-19, CXR had much faster TATs than rRT-PCRs. Keywords: Radiography, thoracic; COVID-19; COVID-19 diagnostic testing; Pneumonia; Deep learning",1.0,coronavirus,True

14,"findings of pneumonia in patients with initially negative rRT-PCR results (4-6) and can be considered as a screening tool for COVID-19 in epidemic areas. However, screening or early diagnosis using chest CT in patients suspected for COVID-19 may not be practical, owing to the risk of viral transmission during the examination, transportation of the patient, and difficulty with disinfecting the environment. Owing to this, chest CT is currently not recommended for screening or initial diagnosis of COVID-19 (7, 8).",1.0,negative,True
15,"Chest X-ray radiograph (CXR) is the primary imaging technique in the diagnosis of pneumonia because of its easy accessibility, low cost, low radiation exposure, and reasonable diagnostic capability (9, 10). Therefore, CXR using a portable radiography unit may be considered as a primary radiologic examination for COVID-19 because patient transportation can be minimized and disinfection is relatively easy (7). However, because of the intrinsic limitation of the two-dimensional projection image, where various anatomic or pathologic structures are overlapped, CXR have lower sensitivity compared to chest CTs (11, 12) and are prone to reading errors and inter- or intra-reader variability (13). Thus, a computer-aided detection (CAD) system that can accurately identify pulmonary opacities suggestive of pneumonia may help promptly and accurately diagnose pneumonia, such as that observed in COVID-19 patients (14). In this regard, we implemented a deep learning-based CAD system for the interpretation of CXR of patients who were suspected for COVID-19.",1.0,COVID-19,True

The CAD system integrated in the protocol was a commercialized deep-learning algorithm (Lunit INSIGHT CXR 2, Lunit Inc.) that was approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety of Korea (15) that detects several thoracic abnormalities, including pulmonary nodules, consolidation, and pneumothorax. The CAD system was originally trained with 54221 normal CXR and 35613 abnormal CXR with four major thoracic diseases including pulmonary malignancy, pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and pneumothorax (15).

In addition, Zhao et al. (24) reported that the extent of abnormalities on chest CT was greater in severe diseases. Furthermore, previous investigations on severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak between 2002 and 2004 have reported that the extent of pulmonary opacity on CXR was a prognostic factor for the adverse patient outcome (25-27). However, obtaining chest CT for all patients suspected for COVID-19 can be very challenging in practice due to the limited availability of CT scanners dedicated to COVID-19 patients, as well as the contagion risk of the virus. Therefore, CXR can be used as the main radiologic examination for patients suspected for COVID-19 and may assist with patient management and prognosis prediction.",1.0,clinical,True
401,"With regards to the identification of pulmonary abnormalities suggesting pneumonia based on chest CT, both the formal radiology reports and CAD results exhibited sensitivities of 81.5%. According to a previous multi-center cohort study by Self et al. (12) comprising 3423 patients in the emergency department, the sensitivity of CXR for pulmonary opacity, with chest CT as a reference standard, was 43.5%. Hence, we considered that the sensitivity of the CAD system would be acceptable for implementation in clinical practice to detect pneumonia. Although we were unable to determine the baseline performance of radiologists without use of the CAD system, it may enhance sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary abnormalities. In a previous study using the same CAD system, the sensitivity of radiology residents for identification of abnormal CXR were significantly enhanced (65.6-73.4%) after review of the CAD results (28).",1.0,clinical,True
402,"Although the CAD system utilized in our study was only designed to detect a limited number of abnormalities, including pulmonary nodules, masses, consolidations, and pneumothorax, the CAD could actually identify other types of lung parenchymal abnormalities, such as ground-glass opacities, the representative imaging finding of COVID-19 (Fig. 1), since it was initially trained to identify various thoracic diseases including pneumonia (15). Because parenchymal abnormalities related to pneumonia, such as consolidation, ground-glass opacities, reticular opacities often look similar and are indistinguishable on CXR, the CAD system was trained to identify abnormalities related to pneumonia, and was not confined to consolidations.",1.0,COVID-19,True
403,"However, the non-specific identification of several abnormalities also resulted in false positives, which led to diminished specificity (59.8% for rRT-PCR-positive COVID-19; 58.7% for CT abnormality suggesting pneumonia) of the CAD (Table 3). However, these false positives could be significantly reduced in the formal reports, since CAD was only used as an assistant tool for radiologists, who were able to discard these false positives upon their interpretation of CXR.",1.0,positive,True
404,"In addition to morphologic types of abnormality on CXR, the visibility of abnormalities on CXR may be important for the detectability of the lesions. In our study, both the CAD system and formal radiology reports exhibited significantly higher sensitivities for visible abnormalities than invisible abnormalities. Although extensive ground-glass opacities that are clearly visible on CXR can be identified by the CAD (Fig. 1), subtle ground-glass opacities that are barely visible on CXR may be missed by the CAD (Fig. 2).",0.0,,False
405,"In our study, the formal radiology reports for CXR exhibited satisfactory TATs (median, 51 minutes), that were significantly shorter than those of the rRT-PCR results (median, 507 minutes). Therefore, we believe that CXR may help screening and triage of patients with high suspicion of COVID-19 pneumonia, especially during an outbreak where there are limited resources for hospitalization and intensive care (21, 29). Considering that our study was performed in a tertiary-referral hospital where radiologists were readily available to interpret CXR, report TATs might be much longer in primary healthcare or community-level practice where immediate availability of radiologists may be limited. Although further studies are required, we believe the CAD system may assist with timely clinical decision making in those situations. In this situation, patients with positive radiographs could be subject to enhanced isolation, which would minimize the transmission of COVID-19 while waiting for rRT-PCR results.",1.0,COVID-19,True
406,"In our practice, no significant difference was observed in the TATs of CXR reports and rRT-PCR results between patients with and without COVID-19, or between patients with and without pneumonia. If the CAD system could be integrated with a notification system that could inform radiologists or physicians of abnormal CAD results immediately after the acquisition of CXR, it may facilitate prioritization of patients with higher suspicion of pneumonia (30).",1.0,COVID-19,True

411,"comparison of performance between the radiologists and the CAD system was not possible, and we could not evaluate whether the CAD system improved the performance of radiologists. To evaluate the effect of the CAD system on the performance of radiologists in a suspected COVID-19 population, further investigation, including the interpretation before and after use of the CAD system, is warranted. Second, our study was performed in a single tertiary institution with a limited number of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, it is difficult to generalize our results, considering that the situation for evaluating patients suspected for COVID-19 may differ significantly across institutions or countries. Third, the CAD system utilized in our study was not trained for all radiographic abnormalities, nor was it trained specifically for COVID-19.",1.0,COVID-19,True
412,"In summary, we implemented a deep learning-based CAD system for the interpretation of CXR of patients suspected for COVID-19. The formal radiology reports with the assistance of CAD exhibited reasonably acceptable performances for identification of rRT-PCR-positive COVID-19 patients (sensitivity, 68.8%) and CT abnormalities suggesting pneumonia (sensitivity, 81.5%). Moreover, the CAD system resulted in faster TATs than rRT-PCR results.
