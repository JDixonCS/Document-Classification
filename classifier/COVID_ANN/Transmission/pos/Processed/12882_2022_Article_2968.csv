5,"Abstract Background: The Tablo® Hemodialysis System (Tablo) is an all in one, easy-to-learn device featuring integrated water purification, on demand dialysate production and two-way wireless data transmission and is approved for use in the acute, chronic, and home settings. Prior reports have demonstrated Tablo's ability to achieve clinical goals, seamlessly integrate into hospitals and reduce cost across a wide range of treatment times. Extension of the Tablo cartridge to 24 h allows prolonged therapy and even greater flexibility for prescribers in the acute setting. The objective is to report on the first ever experience with Tablo prolonged therapy between 12 and 24 h in critically ill patients treated at a single-center ICU.",1.0,transmission,True
6,"Methods: Nursing staff were trained during a single training session on Tablo prolonged therapy. After a run-in period of five treatments, Tablo data were collected via real-time transmission to a cloud-based, HIPAA compliant platform and reviewed by site staff. Dialysis treatment delivery, clinically significant alarms, and clotting events were recorded. Sub-group analysis between COVID-19 positive and negative patients were reported.",1.0,transmission,True
7,"Results: One hundred (100) consecutive Tablo prolonged treatments had a median prescribed treatment time of 24 h and a median achieved treatment time of 21.3 h. Median cartridge usage was 1.3 per treatment. The dialysis treatment time was delivered in 91% of treatments, with 6% ending early due to an alarm, and 3% ending due to clotting.",0.0,,False
8,Clinically significant alarms occurred at a median rate of 0.5 per treatment hour with a resolution time of 18 s. Median blood pump stoppage time related to these alarms was 2.3 min per treatment. Blood pump stoppage time was higher in the COVID-19 subgroup when compared to the non-COVID-19 subgroup.,1.0,Clinical,True
9,"Conclusion: Tablo successfully achieves prescribed treatment time with minimal therapy interruptions from alarms or cartridge changes. This data demonstrates the effectiveness of Tablo in achieving personalization of treatments necessary for unstable patients and enabling successful delivery of extended therapy with minimal clotting. Tablo's prolonged therapy meets the needs of critically patients, including COVID-19 positive patients, requiring renal replacement therapy for greater than 12 h.",1.0,personal,True

17,"unit (ICU) [1, 2]. AKI occurs in up to half of all patients admitted to the ICU, and of these patients, 4-13% require RRT [1, 3]. While there are various RRT modalities available, including continuous, prolonged, and intermittent, meta-analyses have demonstrated minimal differences in clinical outcomes between these modalities [4]. However, ICU clinicians typically favor treatments of greater than 12 h for hemodynamically unstable patients [5-7], as they allow for more gradual fluid removal and solute clearance over the course of the treatments [5, 8].",1.0,clinical,True
18,"The same severe illness that leads to the need for a prolonged therapy often results in organ failure beyond AKI; further complicating the treatment regimen with other critical lifesaving devices, such as mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy, that can lead to interdevice interaction and competition for vascular access [9, 10]. Prolonged therapy is frequently administered concurrently with ECMO, either independently or integrated into the circuit, to mitigate hemodynamic instability and fluid imbalance [11] presenting a highly complex and labor-intensive treatment regimen.",1.0,flu,True
19,"The acuity of these patients, combined with the increased treatment time and slower blood flow rate, adds complexity to the effective delivery of prolonged therapies. The most common complication is associated with circuit clotting or clogging. Clotting in the filter or extracorporeal circuit may be exacerbated by compromised or inadequate vascular access [12]. Poor catheter function may trigger arterial and venous pressure alarms which stagnate extracorporeal blood flow, leading to increased blood pump stoppage that exacerbate clotting events [5, 13]. During the pandemic, the risk of clotting or clogging the circuit during prolonged therapies was further increased in COVID-19 positive patients with AKI due to the prothrombotic state induced by the disease process [14]. Clotting and clogging of the extracorporeal circuit can have significant impact on the ability to achieve ultrafiltration and metabolic clearance targets due to treatment interruptions. In addition to the risk of failing to achieve clinical goals, these interruptions drive up the cost of care due to increased supply utilization from repeated system set up [15], and create additional work for an already highly burdened critical care nursing staff [16].",1.0,pandemic,True

133,"Over the course of 100 treatments, only three treatments were discontinued due to visible clotting. Two of the three occurred in COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with the increased risk of circuit clotting reported in the literature [19]. There remained a single clotting event in a non-COVID-19 patient on a heparin drip.",1.0,COVID-19,True
134,"The rate of clinically significant alarms per 24-h treatment period was low and was accompanied by rapid alarm resolution. The mean blood pump stoppage time observed in this study (4.5±5.2 min per treatment), trended lower than previous reports from a conventional RRT device (6.7±9.5 min) [20]. The increase in blood pump stoppage times in the COVID-19 subgroup can be attributed to the higher number of total alarms per treatment and higher mean time to alarm resolution. The alarm resolution time in this subgroup was likely due to the need for ICU staff to don PPE prior to entry into the treatment room.",1.0,clinical,True

Additionally, while data concerning the incidence of clotting in RRT requiring COVID-19+ECMO patients are scarce, the existing literature supports that these patients are at an elevated risk of experiencing clotting events [11, 21] and may also have contributed to the results observed.",1.0,COVID-19,True
137,"Strengths This is the first study to provide detailed data concerning the expanded capabilities that Tablo can now deliver on a single cartridge for up to 24 h. The study evaluated Tablo's performance in a real-world setting, which is particularly valuable as it demonstrates Tablo can successfully deliver adequate renal replacement therapy to critically ill patients, including those with COVID-19 and undergoing ECMO therapy. As COVID-19 surges are likely to continue well into the future [22], these data further support that Tablo therapy prescribed for greater than 12 h can perform treatments with minimal interruptions and decrease the overall burden on nursing staff associated with cartridge changes, complex alarm troubleshooting, and clotted extracorporeal circuits.",1.0,COVID-19,True
138,"Future directions The minimal clotting events and low cartridge usage that were observed are incredibly encouraging, especially in a vulnerable population at increased risk of clotting due to COVID-19 infection [23, 24]. Although not utilized as part of this study, Tablo has the ability to deliver a scheduled saline flush that can automate the delivery of up to 300 mL of saline every 60 min during treatment. While further evidence is needed, prior reports on the use of saline flushes in outpatient intermittent hemodialysis suggests the benefit of reduced clotting during treatment [25, 26]. Additional studies in acute care settings are required to evaluate the effectiveness this feature may have on clotting outcomes and help fill evidence gaps related to anticoagulation strategies in patients requiring prolonged therapies [27].",1.0,COVID-19,True

143,"Limitations While the XTEND trial is the first report of Tablo utilization for greater than 12 h in critically ill patients with key insights into the effectiveness in the acute care setting, there are several limitations to the study. This observational study was not sufficiently powered and involved a small sample size without a control group. Additionally, the treatment success outcomes were subjective and based on assessments made by the clinical expertise of hospital staff. A randomized clinical trial examining multiple, well defined endpoints is needed to appropriately determine the efficacy of Tablo compared to conventional RRT devices. While patient SOFA scores were recorded and assisted in determining acuity, principal diagnosis or primary reason for hospital admission were not included and therefore limit the broader application of these results to a specific AKI population requiring RRT (e.g., sepsis, post-surgical, trauma patients). This also applies to patients admitted to the ICU primarily for COVID-19 complications, as it is possible patients included in this study may have been positive for SARS-CoV-2 upon admission, but not actively experiencing acute COVID viral illness. Furthermore, since the study was conducted at a single center, we are unable to generalize these results. While evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have been published regarding the prescription and delivery of RRT, there is wide variation in treatment implementation amongst institutions [28], which necessitates a larger, multi-center trial to adequately expand upon the findings reported here.",1.0,trial,True
144,"Given the above limitations, the results of the XTEND trial support that Tablo is effective in the treatment of critically ill patients in the ICU who require prolonged therapies, including COVID-19 positive patients. The results presented suggest that Tablo's low alarm rates, rapid alarm resolution, minimal blood pump stoppage time and low cartridge usage per 24 h can reduce the overall cost and nursing staff burden traditionally associated with the provision of extended dialytic therapy in the ICU.",1.0,trial,True
