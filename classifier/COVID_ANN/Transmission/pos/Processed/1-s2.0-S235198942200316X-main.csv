9,"The wildlife trade is a major cause of species loss and can trigger disease transmission. While the COVID-19 pandemic sparked public interest in eliminating the wildlife trade, a better under­ standing is needed of the economic repercussions of COVID-19 on those who rely on wildlife farming for their livelihoods. Using the case studies of Ba Ria Vung Tau and Binh Duong provinces in Vietnam - a country seen as Asia's wildlife trade hotspot - this paper explores COVID-19's impacts on wildlife farms and their owners. Understanding these impacts is important, both in order to design appropriate interventions to support local people in mitigating COVID-19's im­ pacts as well as to inform effective policymaking around wildlife conservation in Vietnam. In this study, we adopted mixed research methods (including a literature and policy review, stakeholder consultation with government agencies and NGOs engaged in designing and monitoring wildlife conservation policies, a wildlife farming household survey, and research validation workshop) to understand the status of Vietnamese wildlife farms, as well as the impacts of COVID-19, and any opportunities and challenges for wildlife conservation and management in Vietnam. Our paper shows that, across the two studied provinces, numbers of wildlife farms and farmed wildlife animals have both declined since the pandemic, with declining market demand and wildlife farm owners experiencing difficulties accessing markets due to travel restrictions. Although this affected wildlife-related income, this represented less than 30 % of families' overall income on average, and thus households were able to maintain their livelihoods through other sources. Most wildlife is raised as an additional food source for farming families and plays an important role in the diets of surveyed households. Findings also highlighted that most surveyed households' postpandemic recovery strategies involved expanding their wildlife farms in scope and scale; these households perceived a stable domestic market and high prices for wildlife products in future.",1.0,disease,True

19,"Our study found several opportunities for sustainable wildlife farming practices, including greater political commitment, an increasing number of wildlife conservation policies, and stronger law enforcement mechanisms. Challenges remain, however; including an unclear and inconsistent policy framework, the presence of an illegal market, and wildlife farm owners' limited knowledge and understanding of wildlife policies. Our paper also shows a lack of comprehensive data and understanding around actual wildlife transactions during the pandemic, leading to challenges in confirming whether COVID-19 had any real impact on wildlife trade. Further research is required to address this knowledge gap.",1.0,pandemic,True

21,"The wildlife trade is a major cause of species loss and is one of the main causes of disease transmission (Liew et al., 2021; Wik­ ramanayake et al., 2021). COVID-19 has thus been seen as an alarm call, raising public and policymakers' awareness and commitment to addressing this challenge (Lin, 2021). Previous studies have found COVID-19 to have multiple and multifaceted impacts on wildlife trading and farming, both positive and negative. The pandemic has led to a decline in financial and human resources devoted to wildlife conservation in many places, posing a significant threat to animal welfare, and challenging government agencies and con­ servation communities alike in the post-pandemic period (Neupane, 2020; Baptista et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2021).",1.0,disease,True
22,"The COVID-19 outbreak also intensified an unsettled debate on whether governments should legalize or criminalize the commercial trade of wildlife (D'cruze et al., 2020; Bennett et al., 2021; Borz´ee et al., 2021). Banning wildlife trade, as China has done, can translate political will to address illegal wildlife farming and trade by strengthening existing monitoring and law enforcement mechanisms and enhancing legislation and regulation around wildlife farming practices, thereby galvanizing rapid, widespread knock-on actions and impacts (Koh et al., 2021). This is necessary to promote improvements in wildlife management, for example updating protected species lists, revising laws, strengthening existing but poorly implemented wildlife policies, and changing consumption behaviors (Yang et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2021).",1.0,COVID-19,True
23,"However, while conservation communities advocate for banning the wildlife trade (Lindsey et al., 2020; Roe et al., 2020), several scholars propose that policymakers and conservationists could take a policy-based approach instead, considering species-specific attributes of biological productivity as well as the management context (Shi et al., 2020; Bennett et al., 2021). This is because a ban might not fully acknowledge and address key drivers of emerging infectious diseases, such as: habitat destruction, which largely driven by agricultural expansion and industrial livestock production (Roe et al., 2020); wildlife consumption and animal-based food systems (Shi and Hu, 2008; Murray et al., 2016); international wildlife trade and crime (Bell et al., 2004); and larger trends of deforestation, defaunation, and environmental exploitation (Gatti, 2020, IPBES, 2020, van Uhm and Zaitch 2021). As COVID-19 has negatively affected local livelihoods (Rahman et al., 2021) and millions worldwide are wildlife-dependent for food security and in­ come (Montgomery and Macdonald, 2020), there is also concern that a wildlife trade ban could undermine human rights and un­ dermine sustainable development longer term (Roe et al., 2020). Scholars highlighting the merits of the wildlife trade, like Yang et al. (2020), Koh et al. (2021) and Xiao et al. (2021), flagged blanket ban weak spots, including how to reduce harm to wildlife farm owners, and ensure policies and measures are in place to support farmers' livelihoods. As wildlife breeding and trade are big businesses, seen by many countries as a poverty reduction tool, solutions must address both conservation and development concerns (You, 2020). Yet limited empirical evidence exists on the pandemic's economic repercussions for those depending on wildlife farming for their live­ lihoods (Mcnamara et al., 2020) to inform such solutions.",1.0,infectious,True
24,"This paper's objective is thus to examine impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on wildlife farms and discuss implications for future wildlife policies in Vietnam. Vietnam is an Asian wildlife trade hotspot (Nash, 2019; Dinh, 2020; Nguyen and Dinh, 2020). Reported cases, both of illegal wildlife trading and of wildlife animals being rescued, have increased sharply over the last five years (Vietnam News, 2021; Vietnam News Agency, 2021, VietNamNet Global 2021). And while the government perceives wildlife farming to contribute significantly to local livelihoods and rural development (Nguyen et al., 2007), it also acknowledges the threat illegal wildlife trading poses to degrading national biodiversity. The COVID-19 pandemic has also intensified national debate around wildlife trading, with civil society organizations pressing the government to strengthen policies as they advocate to ban wildlife farming and trading (The Guardian, 2020). On 23 July 2020, the Prime Minister of Vietnam issued Directive 29/CT-TTg, outlining urgent measures to tighten wildlife management; this included suspending wildlife imports, strengthening law enforcement, and stricter local-level monitoring of wildlife farming activities (Prime Minister of Vietnam, 2020). This regulation stirred new hope for conservation communities wishing to reduce the wildlife trade (Nguyen, 2020a), despite concerns about the potential for it to turn into an empty promise (Environmental Investigation Agency, 2020). While various media outlets report the pandemic's limited impact on slowing or reducing wildlife trading activities (Bui and Quan, 2021; Nguyen, 2021b), there is scant scientific evidence to support this; under­ standing these impacts is key, both to design appropriate interventions to support local people to mitigate such impacts, and to inform effective policymaking around wildlife conservation in Vietnam.",1.0,COVID-19,True

30,"We began by reviewing relevant literature to identify areas with large numbers of wildlife farms, before interviewing two central government agencies and three NGOs engaged in designing and monitoring wildlife conservation policies, to identify potential sites and knowledge gaps. From this we identified four potential research sites in the provinces of Thanh Pho Ho Chi Minh, Binh Duong, Ba Ria Vung Tau and Dong Nai. Over 70 % of Vietnamese wildlife farms are in the Southern region (Vietnam News, 2020), and these four provinces see large numbers of wildlife farming activities (Dard, 2007; Nguyen, 2010; Luong, 2018, Pannature, 2020, Le, 2021, Nguyen, 2021a, Sang, 2021). The research team then visited these four provinces to validate reported data, consult stakeholders and obtain research approval. Based on this, the research team chose Binh Duong and Ba Ria Vung Tau as the locations for the study sites. This was partly due to research approval by local government offices. As such, future research in the remaining two provinces would provide a more comprehensive regional overview and ensure site selection has not impacted results; for example, governmental willingness to participate may reflect differing local perspectives, compared with those of locations more reticent to be surveyed.",1.0,area,True

Households in both provinces shared that many brokers had forced small-scale farms to sell them their wildlife at low cost, so they could make more profit post-pandemic. Lockdowns and stricter wildlife conservation policies meant households were unable to sell wildlife products overseas and to other provinces, so they resorted to trading illegally within their provinces without informing government officers.",1.0,pandemic,True
125,"However, the majority of households across both provinces (60 % in Binh Duong and 88 % in Ba Ria Vung Tau) claimed the pandemic had a minor impact on them as wildlife farming was not their primary income source (less than 30 % of the household budget); their main income sources were other businesses, like hostel services and restaurants (Fig. 3).

Second, as Binh Duong was a COVID-19 hotspot in the South (Phuoc, 2021) its lockdown was longer than that of Ba Ria Vung Tau (Hoang, 2021). Third, most Ba Ria Vung Tau wildlife farmers targeting domestic markets also had restaurants, so they could continue selling meat products during the pandemic; in contrast Binh Duong farm owners rely on selling to other provinces, notably Ho Chi Minh City, which was another COVID-19 hotspot with a lengthy lockdown period.",1.0,social,True

Although Binh Duong government officers shared that farm owners were no longer informing officials of their wildlife sales since the pandemic, they also acknowledged insufficient data on wildlife trade transactions to confirm their hypothesis.

199,"The difference here could be explained by several factors. As wildlife farming households in Binh Duong operate at a smaller scale, most have limited capital to invest in large-scale farming. The pandemic's impact on household income has thus led several households to have weaker capacity and interest in maintaining and expanding their operations. In contrast, many Ba Ria Vung Tau households were able to continue sales of wildlife products in the domestic market, and few were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; expansion is thus seen as strategy to overcome any setbacks experienced due to the pandemic and improve future income.",1.0,pandemic,True

Surveyed households shared that such knowledge was determined by their access to government programs, ranger support, and social networks among wildlife farmers, all of which varied significantly. In Binh Duong, 27 households (64.3 %) said government agencies proactively guided and supervised wildlife farming activities; this figure was just 4 households (8 %) in Ba Ria Vung Tau. A small number of households surveyed (8 households (16 %) in Ba Ria Vung Tau and 4 households (10 %) in Binh Duong) highlighted the risk of uncertain markets and prices for wildlife products, while others flagged more competition, caused by increasing numbers of new wildlife farms, as a challenge.",1.0,disease,True

203,"The Government of Vietnam argues that captive breeding and artificial propagation contribute to local income and employment (Nguyen et al., 2007). Wildlife farming continues to prove an economically attractive option for households in our studied sites, with new farms being established even after the COVID-19 pandemic. While previous studies show COVID-19 lockdowns affected the in­ comes of similar wildlife businesses elsewhere in the world (Mcginlay et al., 2020, Abeli Shoo et al., 2021, Cahyadi and Newsome, 2021, Rahman et al., 2021, Spenceley et al., 2021), in Vietnam just a few surveyed wildlife farms believed COVID-19 had seriously affected their businesses; wildlife-related income contributing less than 30 % to most households' income in Ba Ria Vung Tau and Binh Duong provinces. This minor impact has several implications for future wildlife conservation policies.",1.0,COVID-19,True
204,"First, our paper supports previous studies, which highlight that effective wildlife conservation policies and projects need to pri­ oritize the diversification of livelihood options (Cherkaoui et al., 2020; Abeli Shoo et al., 2021; Mcelwee et al., 2020) to reduce financial dependence on wildlife farming. Second, our paper flags a significant data gap when it comes to legal and illegal operations. The current monitoring and evaluation system relies on reported numbers of registered wildlife farms. However, this monitoring indicator does not give a comprehensive understanding of the scope and scale of operations. A reduced number of farms does not necessarily indicate less wildlife farming; such a decline could mean a local shift from offline to online markets, as our study found, or that wildlife farming has become more secretive since the pandemic. This would explain the increasing number of reported violations around illegal trade in Binh Duong province (Dinh, 2019; Le, 2019), and flags the further challenges policymakers now face in monitoring the wildlife trade. When animals are bred for human consumption and local people want to expand the scale of this en­ terprise, this raises a flag of alarm for biodiversity conservation.",1.0,pandemic,True
205,"Stakeholders' concerns around the government's limited ability to oversee and monitor wildlife farms have led to some conser­ vationists advocating for a wildlife trade ban in Vietnam (Nguyen, 2020b). However, both the banning and sustainable management of wildlife trading remain controversial (Bennett et al., 2021). A ban could reduce the risk of emerging infectious diseases (Aguirre et al., 2020), and prevent the biodiversity destruction that results from wildlife farms `laundering' wild animals to sell onto other farms (Brooks et al., 2010). On the other hand, the fact that some households raise wildlife for food and felt wildlife farming was their best plan post-pandemic highlights that a blanket ban could both be logistically challenging to implement, and negatively impact devel­ opment and human rights (Roe et al., 2020). With farmers determined to expand and maintain their farms to respond to continued demand, our paper shows that addressing the wildlife trade nationally depends on a major shift in global wildlife consumption patterns (Li et al., 2021).",1.0,infectious,True
206,"Several studies emphasize that policymakers will need to adopt a participatory approach to decision making, to ensure that future use and trade of wildlife is safe, environmentally sustainable and socially equitable (Booth et al., 2021, 2021). Our paper reveals a critical concern around wildlife farming - farmers' lack of knowledge and awareness around veterinary requirements, animal health and human safety. Households surveyed in both provinces are currently raising diverse species in their farms, with weak understanding around human and animal health implications.

There are limited studies and analysis to uncover these risks, however, nor policies in place to address them. As well as strengthening policies and law enforcement, government agencies must also conduct awareness campaigns and undertake appropriate policy interventions so as to reduce consumer demand for wildlife products domestically. Rigorous research and impact evaluation on the effectiveness of these campaigns is equally essential (Nuno et al., 2018; Veríssimo and Wan, 2019; Thomas-Walters et al., 2021). For government agencies focused on public health and wildlife, it is critically important to assess diverse wildlife trade situations for the risk of potentially serious zoonotic diseases, so as to inform policy design and ensure appropriate policy interventions (Wikra­ manayake et al., 2021).",1.0,disease,True

222,"This paper examined the various impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Vietnamese wildlife farms, as well as wildlife farm owners' strategies in response to the pandemic. Our findings show that although COVID-19 did affect local incomes, the extent of this impact depended on how diversified household income streams were, the scale of farming operations, and whether farm owners were able to adapt their business models (for example, by moving from offline to online trade). Our paper also highlights some key challenges for implementing a wildlife trade ban, particularly when most wildlife farmers intend to maintain or expand their wildlife farms postpandemic. As many farmers raise wildlife for family food, any future ban would also affect their dietary requirements. A particular challenge for wildlife management in Vietnam is weak understanding among wildlife farmers around wildlife policies, human-animal health risks, and how to implement environmental safeguards and human health measures so as to prevent risks. Addressing these challenges requires policy commitment, as well as participatory decision-making processes and capacity building among wildlife farm owners. Future research is also needed to document both the longer-term impacts of the pandemic on Vietnamese wildlife farms, and how government and farm owners respond to COVID-19 and wildlife conservation policies, so as to inform appropriate policy interventions.",1.0,COVID-19,True
