9,"Abstract SARS-­CoV-­2 has been detected both in air and on surfaces, but questions remain about the patient-­specific and environmental factors affecting virus transmission. Additionally, more detailed information on viral sampling of the air is needed. This prospective cohort study (N ,""56) presents results from 258 air and 252 surface samples from the surroundings of 23 hospitalized and eight home-­treated COVID-­19 index patients between July 2020 and March 2021 and compares the results between the measured environments and patient factors. Additionally, epidemiological and experimental investigations were performed. The proportions of qRT-­PCR-­positive air (10.7% hospital/17.6% homes) and surface samples (8.8%/12.9%) showed statistical similarity in hospital and homes. Significant SARS-­CoV-­2 air contamination was observed in a large (655.25m3) mechanically ventilated (1.67 air changes per hour, 32.4-­421L/s/patient) patient hall even with only two patients present. All positive air samples were obtained in the absence of aerosol-g­ enerating procedures. In four cases, positive environmental samples were detected after the patients had developed a neutralizing IgG response. SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA was detected in the following particle sizes: 0.65-­4.7 m, 7.0-­12.0 m, >10 m, and <100m.

18,"Increasing scientific evidence indicates the dominance of short-­and long-­range airborne transmission of SARS-­CoV-­2.1-­6 The observed transmission risks have been higher indoors than outdoors,7 and discussion on precautions for hospital and home environments has been intense. In a study that aerosolized SARS-­CoV-­2 under laboratory conditions, aerosols' infectivity was retained for up to 16h,8 while another study estimated the half-­life in aerosols to be approximately 1.1-1­ .2 h (95% CI 0.64-­2.64).9 Outside of the laboratory, signs of viable SARS-­CoV-­2 in the air have been detected,10-­12 and the virus has also been cultured from exhaled air.13 A direct link between SARS-­CoV-­2 viral load, emission, and airborne concentration was recently demonstrated by Buonanno et al.14 A few studies have detected SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA in the air at home-­environment.15,16 In hospitals, PCR-­based studies have found SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA in room air,17-­25 as well as from air conditioning filters located over 50m from the patient room.26 Even though previous studies have mainly used long collection times or high flow rates, challenge is that only a proportion of the air present in a room can be analyzed. Additionally, indoor turbulence highly affects local concentrations.27,28 Thus, questions remain about the risk of infection during shorter meetings or in rooms with a larger air space, and whether the findings would be similar in the home environment. As environmental sampling is highly demanding and sample sizes rather small, more patient data are also needed to draw further conclusions in future systematic reviews.",1.0,transmission,True
19,"According to laboratory studies, the stability of SARS-­CoV-­2 on surfaces varies depending on the surface type and environmental conditions.9,29-­32 However, its ability to sustain infectivity on surfaces outside laboratory conditions is largely unknown.33 SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA has been found, for example, on high-­touch surfaces, floors, and toilets,18,19,34,35 and there are a few possibly positive culture findings of SARS-­CoV-­2 from the surfaces.36-­38 The effect of age and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) on the spread of SARS-­CoV-­2 has been speculated,39-4­ 1 but there is a lack of clear evidence for the role of patient-­related factors.",1.0,positive,True

During the collection period, the COVID-­19 incidence in the Uusimaa area was 1-­180 cases/100000 inhabitants/7days (average 61 cases/100000 inhabitants per week) and the test positivity rate varied between 0.1% -­ 4.5%.62 Collections included 56 patients of which 31 were index patients (1-2­ per collection, see Methods for details), 21 of whom were treated on a COVID-­19 cohort ward in a large patient hall, one in a single-­patient room, one in the intensive care unit (ICU), and eight patients treated in their homes (Figure 2).",1.0,area,True
79,The cohort ward had an air volume of 655.25m3 (height 4.5 m) and was provided with clean 100% outdoor supply air of 421L/s generating 1.67 air changes per hour (ACH) and 32.4-4­ 21L/s/patient depending on the number of patients. The mechanical ventilation type in the ward,0.0,,False

This change generated a higher 2.99 ACH for the last measurement (patient 56, P56). The single room in the ward had displacement ventilation with 100% outdoor supply air generating 4.7 ACH. The ICU room had a laminar inlet area in the middle of the room generating 20.52 overall ACH, and an outlet on the side of the room. All the air was filtered with HEPA13 before entering the room. The measured patient located partly under the laminar area. All measured home environments had automated mechanical ventilation, which is normal in Finland. The measured rooms were circa 15-­30m2 in area with a normal room height of 2.5 m. We were not able to measure the exact ACH at homes, but it is expected that they followed building regulations which recommend 0.5 ACH for homes.

Additionally, low oxygen saturation showed a connection with a higher possibility of SARS-­CoV-­2 surface findings and a potential connection with air findings, which could follow from increased particle generation due to respiratory stress. Most (83%, 15/18) of our positive air samples with known particle size were in particles smaller than 4.7 m, which supports the findings that at least 85% of the viral load is emitted in aerosols smaller than 5 m.6,20,66 This is in line with the fact that particle generation produces a distribution which form depends on the activity that is causing the particles.

With an average respiratory rate of 14/min and volume of 0.5 L/breath, this would mean exposure times of 40min (Andersen) and 10 min (Button) for the examined virus variants (alpha and undetermined VoC (Andersen), as well as non-­VoC (Button)).

306,"Our results from respiratory activities demonstrated that 0.5-­2 min of activity did not produce enough virus to be detected with qRT-­PCR with this methodology, even from a close distance of 10 cm.

Still, a quite high proportion (11.5%) of passive air samples was positive for SARS-­ CoV-­2 RNA. This supports the role of aerosol particle deposition as a source to surface contamination as previous studies have suggested.17,80 The deposition offers more gentle collection method and possibility to collect directly to the cells or cell media possibly allowing more viral preservation compared to active sampling.

However, in many countries, COVID-­positive patients have been separated from COVID-­negative ones with just curtains and distance.

315,"The building body of evidence supports airborne route predominance for SARS-­CoV-­2 transmission,1-­4,14 and an animal study indicates that aerosol inoculation is a more efficient route and causes more severe pathology and higher viral loads.100 Fomites have not been proven to serve as the sole or primary vehicle of transmission.101 The probability for surface transmission is estimated to be likely rare, generally less than 1 in 10 000, and the disease manifestation milder.102 The environmental samples that commonly presented infectious virus in previous studies were mainly in direct contact with infected patients' mucus membranes, or saliva or sputum secretions (e.g., nasal prongs, nasal canula, used tissue, patients mask, and endotracheal tube).25,38 In this study, families that took protective measures (including isolation of the infected family member) and respiratory protection (surgical masks or FFP2 respirators) were able to prevent further infections even when qRT-­PCR-­positive samples were collected from both surfaces and air. However, in a household where all surfaces were cleaned many times a day but no respiratory protection was used, all family members became infected. This supports the importance of air hygiene, including also portable air cleaners as a supportive method as shown in previous studies,15,28 and also encourages control of infection spread in homes. Similar findings supporting the use of masks, isolation with closed door, and opening windows in home environment were found to lower the risk of contamination in the work of Picard et al.103 Overall our results indicate that transmission may happen through several transmission routes as supported also in previous systematic review.20 Infection control is even more important with VoC strains that feature a higher rate of household transmission.104",1.0,transmission,True

Moreover, we obtained positive air and surface samples when the index patient had a positive IgG result and NAbs, which agrees with the findings of Lei et al.108 This contradicts the suggestion that NAbs solely could be a reliable marker for non-­infectivity78. In the view of infection control, we agree with Lei et al.,108 Tan et al.109 and Wölfel et al.110 that the risk for exposure can remain after the patient starts to seroconvert and possibly improve clinically. As seroconversion seems an unreliable marker for viral clearance, other means, such as an antigen test, should be used to assess the infection risk before ending precaution protocols.111,112",1.0,positive,True
318,"Showing viable virus from environmental is highly demanding. Previous studies have presented a few possibly positive findings.10-­13,36-­38,66 However, the findings of those studies have been under criticism as none of them has been able to show clear CPE with significant decrease in Ct values leaving questions if the CPE was truly induced by SARS-­CoV-­2. Despite the culturing attempts of all 258 air samples and 212 surface samples, we were unable to detect viable virus from the environment. Also, only 20% of qRT-­PCR-­positive saliva samples of symptomatic patients were positive in cell culture. We did several attempts to optimize the culture protocol (Supplementary Methods) and performed qRT-­PCR on culture media whenever the slightest sign of CPE was detected. Explanations for our negative results are that there was no infectious virus in the environment at the time of the samplings or that current methods were not sensitive enough to detect it. As SARS-­CoV-­2 is efficiently transmitted in hospital wards and between family members,113,114 even from quarantine room to another via corridor and similarly timed door opening,115 we conclude that the methodology is likely too unsensitive.116 A significant loss of infective viruses in air sampling has also been demonstrated,117-­123 and current impaction and impingement sampling methods have low collection efficiency for small, nanometer-­sized particles.121,122 Sousa et al. managed to show SARS-­CoV-­2 related PFU findings with electrostatic air sampler, which may provide a more gentle collection method, however, even they observed rapid and significant inactivation of the virus during collection.12 The absolute collection efficiencies of the samplers are unknown and should be addressed in future research.123 Even though detection of viral RNA in the air and on the surface does not necessarily mean an infectious virus, negative culturing results do not rule out the infection risk either. Due to these difficulties and the high transmission rates, we consider already RNA findings to be interpreted as a possible infection risk. In the future, sampling methods and devices should be developed to better preserve the viability and infectivity, for example mimicking the humidity and airflow of the airways to avoid mechanical stress and utilizing direct collection onto the cells or culture medium to avoid losses during transport.

Recent findings suggest that the environmental contamination is rather similar between the first variants and omicron,78 suggesting that the results from the earlier variants can still be considered to provide valid information for the current situation.",1.0,,True
324,"Our study also has some limitations. Even though the overall number of our samples is quite high compared to previous studies, it is still limited in the statistical aspect and only able to detect major differences and associations. As environmental sampling is time consuming and resource intensive, making it challenging to achieve a statistically large enough sample size, it is important to combine findings from several different studies for more detailed analysis. We only conducted environmental sampling at a single time point. In the future, a longitudinal examination could enable a more accurate examination of the effects of the course of disease for environmental contamination. The mean time from the onset of symptoms until sampling varied between homes and hospital and may affect the results. However, as the infection requiring hospital treatment is more severe, the viral loads may stay high longer,112,126 and accordingly, no major differences were detected in viral load in saliva in our study between homes and hospital patients. This would provide rather similar expectation for environmental contamination as Buonanno et al examined.14 Also, patients generally arrive to the hospital at the later stage of the disease (excluding hospital-­acquired infections that were not detected in this dataset) which makes our dataset suitable to represent the real situation between homes and hospitals. In addition, we only measured the IgG and NAb response, but viral secretion from mucus membranes can continue if the IgA response is weak.127 The IgA immune response should thus be examined further in upcoming studies. The qRT-­PCR results might include some uncertainty due to the differences in the texture and fluidity of saliva and should be considered as estimates. As many samples were collected from a large patient hall, it is possible that some observed viruses might have originated from other than the index patient. However, most of the surface samples were from patient-­specific surfaces, and aerosols are known to concentrate near the source,71 indicating that most of the positive samples are expected to be produced by the index patient. Particle size cutoffs in Andersen samplers might be slightly higher than estimated, as the amount of liquid used in the sampling was slightly smaller than recommended due to practical reasons.
