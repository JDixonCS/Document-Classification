42,"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been deployed broadly as an early warning tool for emerging COVID-19 outbreaks. WBE can inform targeted interventions and identify communities with high transmission, enabling quick and effective responses. As the wastewater (WW) becomes an increasingly important indicator for COVID-19 transmission, more robust methods and metrics are needed to guide public health decision-making. This research aimed to develop and implement a mathematical framework to infer incident cases of COVID-19 from SARS-CoV-2 levels measured in WW. We propose a classification scheme to assess the adequacy of model training periods based on clinical testing rates and assess the sensitivity of model predictions to training periods. A testing period is classified as adequate when the rate of change in testing is greater than the rate of change in cases. We present a Bayesian deconvolution and linear regression model to estimate COVID-19 cases from WW data. The effective reproductive number is estimated from reconstructed cases using WW. The proposed modeling framework was applied to three Northern California communities served by distinct WW treatment plants. The results showed that training periods with adequate testing are essential to provide accurate projections of COVID-19 incidence.",1.0,epidemiology,True

49,"Organization (WHO) recommended implementing mass testing programs as a containment measure. Individual diagnostic testing informs contact tracing and medical interventions, ideally cutting chains of transmission short and containing outbreaks. Mass clinical screening programs can also provide valuable data on community-level health trends, but maintaining mass testing programs for the purpose of community-level monitoring is expensive and requires robust infrastructure with consistent availability of testing supplies and human resources (Vandenberg et al., 2021). Moreover, diagnostic tests validated in low-throughput clinical settings (like nucleic acid amplification tests or NAATs) are not necessarily efficient platforms for constructing community screening programs (Raffle et al., 2020). Design-wise, employing such tests for large-scale screening requires extensive logistical coordination over large geographic areas. This becomes especially complicated when the options for diagnostic tests are myriad, lack standardization, and depend heavily on local social landscapes. Small biases in the tests may be inflated when deployed broadly, leading to large spurious associations at the population level (Mardian et al., 2021; Mercer and Salit, 2021).",1.0,containment,True
50,"Public health authorities are turning to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as an alternative strategy for less-biased population-level surveillance of COVID-19. WBE uses biomarkers in wastewater (WW) to monitor trends in community-level health indices. WBE methods have been used to detect changes in drug consumption (Castiglioni et al., 2014; Zuccato et al., 2005), dietary patterns (Choi et al., 2019), and the circulation of pathogens like poliovirus and norovirus (Asghar et al., 2014). Measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in WW correlate strongly with changes in COVID-19 prevalence in the associated communities (Huisman et al., 2022; McMahan et al., 2021; Vallejo et al., 2022; Wolfe et al., 2021). Since the onset of the pandemic, WBE of SARS-CoV-2 has been implemented in over 67 countries and 279 universities (COVIDPoops19, 2021). In some places, WBE programs have detected changes in SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in WW prior to changes in local COVID-19 hospitalization activity and spikes in NAAT screening cases (Kirby et al., 2022; Mallapaty et al., 2020; Medema et al., 2020b; Peccia et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2022; Wurtzer et al., 2020). Others have used WBE to assess the effectiveness of public health interventions (Pillay et al., 2021), and recently, WBE was used to predict hospitalizations and ICU admissions (Galani et al., 2022). In addition to monitoring trends, WBE can provide estimates of critical disease transmission parameters in the community without the biases associated with test-seeking behavior or poor access to testing programs.",1.0,epidemiology,True
51,"An ongoing challenge for WBE is developing robust data collection and interpretation methods that are comparable across time and geography. Variations in sampling design and sample processing methods, natural variability in viral shedding rates in feces, variability in WW flow volume, population fluctuations, and location-specific characteristics of WW management are all factors that make inference of new COVID-19 cases from WW data challenging (Ahmed et al., 2020; Hill et al., 2020; Medema et al., 2020a; Zhu et al., 2021). Such factors will ultimately affect uncertainty estimates when modeling disease incidence and other public health indicators. An ideal WBE program would implement a generalized approach that provides consistent estimates of disease burden in a targeted population, yielding public health metrics like the disease incidence, disease prevalence and/or the effective reproductive number (Re). Previous studies that approach this problem include: simple algebraic adjustments with environmental constants (Monteiro et al., 2022); estimating the total number of cases with a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model informed by WW results (McMahan et al., 2021); using regression analysis to estimate the number of infected people (Vallejo et al., 2022); and making near real-time estimates of Re (Huisman et al., 2022; Schoen et al., 2022).",1.0,flu,True
52,"We propose and compare two modeling approaches: a simple linear model and a Bayesian deconvolution approach to estimate COVID-19 incident cases from WW viral loads.

58,"Staff from three Northern California WW treatment facilities (Davis, Woodland, and UC Davis) provided 24-hour composite WW samples 5-7 days per week. Samples were acquired using Teledyne ISCO 5800 refrigerated autosamplers in Davis and Woodland and a Hach Sigma 900 autosampler for UC Davis. The autosampler in Davis was programmed to collect 400 mL of influent every 15 ""pulses"", where one pulse was set at 10,000 gal. An average of 24 pulses was expected per day based on an average daily influent flow of 3.6 million gallons per day (MGD). The autosampler in Woodland was programmed to acquire 100 mL of influent every 15 min over a 24-hour period. The autosampler for UC Davis was programmed to acquire approximately 200 mL of influent every 20 min over a 24-hour period. The reported sample collection date corresponded to the date when an autosampler program was completed. Davis and UC Davis provided 12 mL samples in new 15-mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes. Woodland provided 1 L samples in Nalgene bottles that were washed, sterilized, and reused over the duration of sampling. Samples were stored at 4 °C and transported weekly in coolers on ice to the analytical lab at UC Davis.

An extraction control blank (nucleasefree water) was included in 90 % of the deep-well plates to assess potential contamination during concentration and extraction. Each well was spiked with 50 L of Nanotrap® Enhancement Reagent 1 (Ceres Nanosciences product ER1 SKU # 10111-10, 10111-30) and 5 L of a stock of vaccine-strain Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV, Bovilis® Coronavirus vaccine) containing an estimated 1.3 × 108 gc/mL as measured by ddPCR. 500 L aliquots of the initial BCoV vaccine stock, prepared from the suspension of lyophilized BCoV vaccine in 20 mL buffer provided with the kit, were stored at -80 ° C prior to use. Each spiked sample was manually agitated by pipetting up and down at least three times using a 5 mL pipette. Samples were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Following incubation, concentration was carried out using 75 L Nanotrap® Magnetic Virus Particles (Ceres Nanosciences) on a KingFisher Apex robot (Thermo Scientific).

N1/N2 and BCoV/PMMoV were quantified in separate duplex assays. Due to high levels of PMMoV, the sample for the PMMoV/BCoV duplex was diluted 40× prior to loading. The duplex ddPCR amplifications were performed in 20 L reactions on a QX ONE ddPCR System (Bio-Rad). Each reaction contained the following components: 1× Supermix, 20 U/L Reverse transcriptase, 15 mM Dithiothreitol from the One-Step RT-ddPCR Advanced Kit for Probe (Bio-Rad), 900 nM of each primer, 250 nM of each probe, and 5 L of sample extract or control. The one-step ddPCR reaction consisted of 3 min plate equilibrium at 25 ° C, 60 min reverse transcription at 50 ° C, 10 min enzyme activation at 95 ° C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94 ° C and 1 min annealing/extension at 58 ° C, and then 10 min enzyme deactivation at 98 ° C and 1 min droplet stabilization at 25 ° C. Preparation and plating of ddPCR master mix were carried out in a separate location from sample loading to avoid contamination. Sample loading was performed using an epMotionR 5075 (Eppendorf) liquid handler. Each ddPCR plate included duplicate positive controls (stock mixture of synthesized gene fragments containing for the four target regions) for each target and duplicated no-template controls (nuclease free water).

Fifteen WW samples that were initially screened as negative for SARS-CoV-2 in routine WW ddPCR monitoring (i.e., extracts had less than 4 positive droplets in merged wells from duplicate analysis) were used to determine the lowest detectable concentrations in ostensibly blank WW samples. Selection of these extracts provided a conservative approach to determining the LOB. The selected extracts were re-analyzed by ddPCR to obtain data for four additional replicates for each sample.

The LOB was set at the value of the concentration measurement for the rank position corresponding to the 95th percentile, calculated as follows: Rank ,"" 0.5 + 0.95 (number of measurements). Since the calculated rank position was a non-integer value, the rank position was rounded up to provide a more conservative LOB. The theoretical LOD was set as the LOB plus two times the standard deviation of all replicate results (Biorad, 2021). The LOD and LOB are reported in Table A.5. In terms of droplet numbers in the blank samples, the highest numbers of positive droplets in the merged wells (four replicates) amongst the fifteen blank samples were 6 (N1) and 8 (N2). Since routine WW samples were analyzed in duplicate, 3 (N1) and 4 (N2) droplets were set as the cutoff to mark samples below the droplet threshold. Samples were also considered below the droplet threshold if there were fewer N1 and N2 droplets than twice the number of droplets in the extraction control blank analyzed on the same day.

The average SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in the initial WW sample was calculated from the average of the N1 and N2 results, corrected for sample and reagent volumes used, and reported as genome copies (gc) per mL WW. BCoV was detected in 100 % of spiked samples, and concentrations of targets were not corrected for BCoV recovery efficiency. If N1 or N2 merged droplet counts were below the minimum droplet threshold, the target was excluded from the average concentration.

A notable difference between the Re estimated with the observed cases and that obtained with the WW data, using both the linear and the deconvolution model, occurs in mid-March and days that followed. In mid-March, the median of Re estimated with observed cases was above 1, and the medians of Re estimated with WW data for the linear and deconvolution model were below 1.

Statistically representative samples can also be difficult to obtain because of the complexity of WW collection systems and the physical challenge of ensuring consistency in sample acquisition and processing (Panchal et al., 2021).

242,"The classification approach we developed to assess the adequacy of model training periods was essential to providing robust estimates of case projections. Training periods that satisfied the proposed characteristics (i.e., adequate testing) resulted in similar estimates from each model and yielded trends consistent with observed cases. Case projections that assumed training periods with poor testing generally underestimated cases compared to projections from adequate training periods. While the proposed models do not seek to recover the curve of reported cases (an underestimate of actual cases, especially in a limited testing scenario), the use of adequate training periods for the WW models enabled us to capture trends in case counts much more closely. It is evident that training periods with inadequate testing introduce a downward bias into the model.",1.0,case,True

WBE programs that determine COVID19 public health metrics at the community level can work as a powerful and cost-effective complement to other, more traditional intervention methods. The analytic methods presented here can inform local public health policy and community-level interventions, for instance, by helping to assess when the initiation of clinical screening programs and nonpharmaceutical interventions are needed. The model can be especially valuable to fill data gaps during surges of infection when clinical testing is inadequate and could be used to assess when estimates of case rates exceed certain thresholds. WBE does come with the inherent challenge of determining the populations being monitored, which is exacerbated if the population served is highly mobile (e.g., a university campus). In other words, WBE methods for tracking COVID-19 are inherently location-specific, whereas public screening programs are tied to the people they serve.
