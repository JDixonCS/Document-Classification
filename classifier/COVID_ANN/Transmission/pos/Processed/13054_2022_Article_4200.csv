8,"Methods: Severe COVID-19 patients included in a single-center prospective observational study at the intensive care unit at Uppsala University Hospital who had undergone DECT were enrolled in the current study.

As a proxy for HPV, pulmonary blood volume distribution was analyzed in both the whole lung and the hypoinflated areas. Total lung weight, index of lung edema, was estimated.",1.0,COVID-19,True
9,"Results: Sixty patients were analyzed, whereof 43 received steroids.

Patients older than 18 years with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV2 on nasal swab specimen and available chest DECT performed during the intensive care stay were analyzed. All patients were not vaccinated for SARS-CoV2. The scans were acquired on clinical indication in static lung conditions, covering the whole lung parenchyma in supine position (see Fig. 1). Comprehensive clinical data were collected at ICU admission and the day of DECT. A subgroup analysis was conducted, dividing the sampled population in two groups: the group of patients not treated with steroids (No-Steroids group) and the one treated with steroids (Steroids group). In June 2020, the early report of the RECOVERY dexamethasone trial [9, 10] was published and the treatment guidelines of the disease were changed accordingly.

For each raw DECT dataset, routine material-specific DECT maps were generated using a secondary workstation (Syngo.via Multimodality Workplace; Siemens Medical Solutions) that applied a three-material decomposition algorithm [18]. Two different series of images were selected and used for further analysis: the gas distribution (pulmonary gas volume) maps and the corresponding blood distribution (pulmonary blood volume) maps (see Fig. 1). Twenty images evenly spaced along the cranial-caudal axis and located between the apex and the diaphragmatic dome were analyzed (see Fig. 1).

As regard to the pulmonary gas volume maps, the Hounsfield units (HU) range of - 1000 (gas) to+100 (non-aerated lung) was considered, as done in previous studies (see Fig. 2). Four lung compartments were then defined [19]: hyperinflated (- 1000 to - 800 HU), normoinflated (- 800 to - 500 HU), poorly inflated (- 500 to - 100 HU) and non-inflated (- 100 to+100 HU) lung.

Each compartment was separately computed and expressed as c­ m2 and as percentage of the total lung volume in each map [22]. From the bell-shaped curves characterizing the HU distribution of perfused blood volume maps, kurtosis was calculated as measure of both dispersion and morphology of the curves (see Fig. 3A) as done in previous studies [23-26]. Kurtosis belongs to the big chapter of the measures of variance, and it is commonly used to quantify both dispersion and morphology of density histograms derived from computed tomography images. A reduced kurtosis corresponds to a decreased homogeneity of pulmonary blood volume. The latter has been previously interpreted as indirect index of HPV efficiency [27]: a low homogeneity of pulmonary blood volume (low kurtosis) corresponding to a preserved HPV.

The main findings of the current study can be summarized as follows: (1) the use of steroids is associated with a high kurtosis of lung perfusion in the hypoventilated regions of the lung. This suggests that steroids might counteract hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction; (2) steroids reduced lung weight, possibly originated by a decreased edema; (3) steroids improve regional gas distribution; (4) despite potential effects on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, gas change was improved as evidenced by a reduction in AaDO2, suggesting that the effects of steroids to reduced edema and improve gas distribution predominated.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Thereby, HPV optimizes ventilation/perfusion match and improves oxygen delivery [38, 39]. A dysregulated HPV has been hypothesized in ARDS [40] and COVID-19 patients [15, 41]. The current study was neither designed to directly investigate the mechanisms of action of steroids on HPV in COVID-19 patients nor planned to grade the HPV derangement induced by COVID-19. However, our data suggest that in patients affected by severe COVID-19 the use of steroids might jeopardize HPV (see Figs. 4, 5 and Additional file 2: Table E2).

Moreover, other concomitant beneficial mechanisms induced by steroids as anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, as well as the reduction in lung edema, demonstrated in this study, might also compensate for a worsened HPV and an exacerbated ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Although HPV is the primary active mechanism influencing regional lung perfusion, other concomitant factors can have a role. Among others, superinfections by Gram-negative bacteria, potentially less hindered in patients treated with steroids, could possibly attenuate HPV [45]. At the same time, direct mechanical effects as well as undefined intracellular signaling can be listed among nonhypoxia-related mechanisms affecting regional lung perfusion [46, 47].",1.0,clinical,True

711,"to the ICU were treated with steroids (Steroids group) as a consequence of a change of treatment guidelines. The fact that steroids have been introduced at a specific time of the pandemic might introduce a chronology bias into the study. As a matter of fact, the SARS-CoV2 pandemic during its course has been characterized by a continuous change of treatment strategies and clinical routines that affect the generalizability of many studies on COVID-19. However, in our study, all the recruited patients were not vaccinated for SARS-CoV2, they were all affected by the same SARS-CoV2 variant (the original Wuhan variant) and, in the studied time lapse, there were not concomitant antiviral/anti-inflammatory treatments specific to COVID-19 other than steroids. Given the demonstrated positive effects of steroids and their routine use in severe COVID-19 patients [9], a prospective study comparing patients exposed or not exposed to steroids would have entailed unsolvable ethical issues. Given the design of the study, the direct causality between steroids and a deranged HPV could not be directly investigated. We did not directly study how steroids influence the pathophysiological mechanisms of HPV. Moreover, a deranged HPV is not the only factor interfering with the regional distribution of perfused blood volume, e.g., pulmonary thrombotic events, lung heterogeneity or interstitial edema are concomitant causes also affecting blood distribution and shunt. However, of all factors potentially aggravating shunt, HPV is the only one influencing, in a targeted manner, hypo-/non-inflated lung regions. The DECT scanner does not reach the resolution necessary to observe the behavior of single capillaries. For this reason, the attenuation value of one voxel portrayed the behavior of many alveoli and of the complex mesh of capillary vessels surrounding them. In this respect, the choice of focusing the analysis to the subpopulation of voxels subtending hypo- or non-inflated areas reduces the possible error deriving from the mechanical interaction between the inflated alveoli and the neighboring capillary units, being them in a similar inflation status. Although intriguing and supported by indirect evidences (i.e., lung imaging), the hypothesized parallelism between the mechanisms of action of steroids in HAPE and COVID19 needs further investigations [51]. Steroids have pleiotropic effects [11] and the current study investigated only some possible consequences of pharmacodynamic mechanisms characterizing steroids. Chest DECT provides static information about gas volume at one predefined moment. Pulmonary gas volume maps are widely used in the literature to infer ventilation distribution [19]. The same applies to DECT pulmonary blood volume maps [52]. DECT generates images describing blood volume distribution within the lung at one single time point: For this reason, these images should only be indirectly and",1.0,pandemic,True
