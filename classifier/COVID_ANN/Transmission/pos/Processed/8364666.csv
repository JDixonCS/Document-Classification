8,"Background. Evidence on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during air travel is scarce. We aimed to estimate the attack rate for wild-type SARS-CoV-2 to improve the evidence base for the adaptation of nonpharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies aboard airplanes. Methods. In collaboration with German Public Health Authorities (PHA), we conducted a follow-up of in- ight SARS-CoV-2 contact persons. We included those contact persons whom the Emergency Operations Centre at the Robert KochInstitute had forwarded to PHA between January to March 2020 (before masking on ights became mandatory) and June to August 2020 (after the introduction of mandatory masking). We retrospectively collected data on whether these contact persons had been successfully contacted, had become symptomatic and had been tested for SARS-CoV-2, and whether alternative exposures other than the ight were known. Results. Complete data that allowed for the calculation of attack rates were available for 108 contact persons (median age of 36 (IQR 24-53), 40% female), traveling on 46 ights with a median ight duration of 3 hours (IQR 2-3.5). 62 of these persons travelled after masking on ights became mandatory. 13/87 developed symptoms, 44/77 were tested (no data for 21 and 31). 13 persons (9 of whom had been SARS-CoV-2 positive) were excluded from the analysis of attack rates due to a likely alternative exposure. We thus identi ed 4 probable in- ight transmissions (2 of which occurred after the introduction of mandatory masking). e overall attack rate resulted in 4.2% (4/95; 95% CI: 1.4%-11.0%). Considering ights after mandatory masking, the attack rate was 3.6% (2/56, 95% CI 0.6%-13.4%), before masking 5.1% (2/39, 95% CI 0.9%-18.6%). Conclusions. e risk of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 transmission during air travel seemed low, but not negligible. In order to formulate an e ective, evidence-based NPI protocol for air travel, further studies considering the di erent transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and vaccination status are needed.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

In Wuhan, high-risk contacts included passengers within 3 rows seating distance, thus including 2 additional rows where transmission risk was possibly lower, thereby reducing the overall estimate. Moreover, the authors did not provide information on how many contact persons included for the calculation of attack rates had actually been successfully contact traced and/or tested. is might affect the estimate in at least 2 ways: if contact tracing/testing proportions were low, a significant number of in-flight transmissions might have gone undetected. On the other hand, if contact tracing was (nearly) complete, the estimate by Hu et al. would probably be more accurate and hereby highlight a limitation of our investigation, and that of Blomquist et al., both were retrospective analyses where only a minority of all in-flight contacts were successfully contact traced.

However, we do not assume that these limitations significantly affected our results, since the local PHA usually validates whether a close contact had actually taken place. Also, although contact persons were often asked about alternative source of infection other than the flight and these persons were subsequently excluded from the analysis, we cannot completely rule out that community transmission might have affected our results.",1.0,contact,True
