9,"Background: The risk of possible cross-reactions between serological tests, together with the clinical similarities between dengue fever and COVID-19, can delay diagnosis and increase the risk of both COVID-19 transmission and worsening. The present study aimed to determine the possibility of cross-reactions among rapid serological tests based on clinical symptoms.",1.0,clinical,True
10,"Methods: Patients with COVID-19, confirmed by RT-PCR and clinical criteria for diagnosing dengue, were recruited consecutively between September 2020 and August 2021 and underwent rapid immunochromatographic diagnostic (RID) tests for AgNS1, IgM, and IgG. Patients who tested positive for acute-phase dengue IgM and AgNS1 underwent a follow-up test after 12-30 days for diagnostic confirmation.",1.0,COVID-19,True
11,"Results: A total of 43 patients were included, 38 of whom required hospital admission, and 8 received intensive care. Seven patients tested positive on the RID tests, comprising 2 NS1 positive (coinfection), one reactive for IgM and IgG (coinfection), three reactive for IgM not confirmed (false-positive), and one reactive for IgG due to previous infection. Two of the 3 patients with coinfection died. Fever, myalgia, headache, and cough were the most common clinical symptoms, while lymphopenia was the most prevalent laboratory finding.",1.0,positive,True

In a study of 13 cases of coinfection in Argentina, Carosella et al. (2021) found a predominance of systemic symptoms, fever in all patients, and no deaths10. In contrast, a study involving 50 cases of coinfection found fever in 52% of patients and a greater rate of progression to death, and most of these cases had alarm signs or severe dengue29.

292,"The occurrence of cross-reaction with the dengue antigen and antibody test among flaviviruses, such as Zika and yellow fever viruses32, has been described. However, cross-reactivity of serological IgM and IgG antibody tests in patients with COVID-19 and dengue has been observed both in the present study and by several other authors6,9,33. Lustin et al.9 found a 22% falsepositivity rate using dengue IgM/IgG RID tests in patients with RT-PCR-diagnosed COVID-19 in a non-endemic region for dengue, although these results were not confirmed when repeated using the ELISA technique. In the present study, only three (7%) patients had possible cross-reactions, a pattern similar to that reported by other authors34,35. A study conducted in Indonesia that assessed 95 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID cases based on dengue RID tests detected only one IgM-positive case, one IgG-positive case, and one probable case of coinfection with positivity for NS1, IgM, and IgG34. In an Italian study, no IgM/IgG positivity for dengue was found in 32 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, although the tests were performed using ELISA36.

294,"The present study had some limitations. First, a small number of patients were included, explained by the inclusion criteria of symptoms of suspected dengue. Second, low circulation of DENV in the city during the study period may have contributed to the occurrence of a few cases of coinfection. Third, the method used for diagnosing dengue was the RID test, and DENV positivity was not confirmed via RT-PCR or ELISA. This shortcoming was partially remedied by repeating the RID tests after 12-40 days in patients who tested positive for acute-phase dengue (NS1 antigen and IgM antibody).",1.0,case,True
