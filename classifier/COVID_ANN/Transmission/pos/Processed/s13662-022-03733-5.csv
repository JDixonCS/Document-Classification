23,"The COVID-19 pandemic is currently one of the most discussed topics worldwide. The first cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Asia in December 2019, but they were not reliably identified then. The People's Republic of China experienced a peak of about 4600 cases per day in mid-February 2020, but by March 2020, the epidemic was largely contained in China and other Asian parts of the world. Europe experienced the first wave of the pandemic in March and April 2020, with, for example, about 5840 new daily infections in Germany in late March and 13,260 new daily infections in France in mid-April 2020.",1.0,COVID-19,True
24,"While infection numbers in Europe were generally low in the summer of 2020, peaks were observed in the United States (67,000 infections/day), Brazil (46,000 infections/day), and India (93,000 infections/day) at certain times between July and September 2020. The third wave was characterized by approximately 35,000 new daily infections in Italy in mid-November 2020, 25,000 new daily infections in Germany around Christmas, 60,000 new daily infections in the United Kingdom in early January 2021, and severe lockdowns within Europe in fall 2020 and winter 2020/2021. The summer of 2021 was characterized by a relaxation of intervention measures in Europe. However, some countries experienced catastrophic COVID-19 events, such as India, with approximately 390,000 new daily infections in early May 2021 [16].",1.0,COVID-19,True
25,"In November 2021, the fourth wave of the pandemic spread throughout Europe despite a fully vaccinated proportion of 67.6% in Germany, 68.9% in the United Kingdom, 74.8% in Italy, 77.7% in France, and 80.6% in Portugal [23]. Nearly 40,000 new daily infections were observed in Germany on November 14th 2021, as well as in the United Kingdom. Achieving even higher vaccination rates and providing booster vaccinations for all to maintain a high level of infection protection are policy issues of concern to all countries. The dangers posed by mutant virus variants such as the delta variant (B.1.617.2), which was first discovered in India in October 2020 and is now the dominant variant infecting people in several countries such as Germany, or the omicron variant (B.1.1.529) discovered in the autumn of 2021, are also being discussed in medicine and the literature. According to the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI), the mRNA vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca are expected to have a protective effect of approximately 90% against severe infection with the alpha (B.1.1.7) variant and 75% against symptomatic infection with the delta (B.1.617.2) variant [20].",1.0,pandemic,True
26,"The mathematical model used in this work to describe the population dynamics of COVID-19 is an SVIHR model. It is based on a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Most mathematical models describing the spread of the disease employ classical compartments in which the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) structure is the most basic form of [2]. Mathematical modeling helps forecast the dynamics of infectious diseases. Over the past nearly two years, a variety of compartmental models have been introduced as enhanced SIR models to study various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",1.0,COVID-19,True
27,"It is clear that SIR models make simplifying assumptions about the population and disease process, which may be a reason to critically question and debate them.

31,"observed data and solely data-driven non-numerical approaches. We always must keep in mind that the novelty of SARS-CoV-2 leads to many uncertainties in all modeling attempts due to biological features of transmission, viral mutations, pathogen behavior, and, of course, the unknown exact number of infections [10]. Moreover, no method can optimally predict the future, but a good model provides an approximation that is accurate enough to be useful for informing public policy [25]. The advantage of PINNs, which use physical laws governing the system in the form of equations, is the ability to be retrained as new data is collected and update the models over time with inferred parameters [10]. SIR-type models add a mathematical indication to a neural network, such that the exclusive data-drivenness is sustained with systematic knowledge of the disease transmission and behavior of the population. Depending on the number and kinds of used compartments and model parameters and their definition, an SIR-type model can be adapted to specific targets one has with respect to implementation. This can, for instance, be the estimation of future hospital occupancy, the influence of specific intervention measures, and isolation rates or the rate of asymptomatic infections. Respective transition rates can be fit into the model. The targets of the implementations and suitability of a certain model depend on the region or country used for data assimilation because of different conditions and disease spreads in distinct regions. In our approach, the country Germany is used for data collection and as the basis of model establishment, and our focus lies on infection and hospitalization numbers.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
32,"In this paper, we do not establish the simplest version of the compartment model. Instead, we develop some kind of extended model, which complements the basic SIR model by a vaccinated and a hospitalized class. The hospitalized compartment is added due to the high significance of hospitalization number predictions for hospital capacity planning and the assessment of the number of severely diseased individuals during pandemic times. We do not include an exposed compartment, which is a possible first enhancement to the SIR model and incorporates infected people who are not (yet) infectious, that is, those with pre-symptomatic and potentially asymptomatic individuals.",1.0,disease,True
33,"In our model, pre-symptomatic individuals are condensed with symptomatic people in the infected compartment, so that we have a single infected compartment of people not hospitalized. Since determining the proportion of asymptomatic individuals in the total infected population is not our goal at this point, we do not include a class of infected individuals who are asymptomatic, but assume at least very mild symptoms in infected individuals. The degree of infectivity of infected individuals can be controlled by adjusting the transmission rate in the model.",1.0,symptomatic,True
34,"Our model includes a vaccination rate and the proportion of the population vaccinated each week. Therefore, the model is adaptable to different vaccination scenarios.

35,"The main method used in this work, called Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and explained in Sect. 3.1, is used to estimate the transmission rate based on the data available in Germany. The PINN itself combines a data-driven method (here based on compartment size data, e.g., number of infections) with the developed ODE system so that it incorporates physical laws.

39,"feasible solutions to those that satisfy a `physical law' to some degree, i.e., an SVIHR compartmental model in this case. The ODE system corresponding to the model serves as an additional constraint in the training phase encoded by an appropriate additional residual loss term. More specifically, the PINN loss function consists of the two weighted terms data loss and residual loss. The data loss is calculated as the difference between the current network output in terms of infection or hospitalization numbers and the reported 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) data covering weeks between March 2020 and December 2021. The residual loss is based on a mathematical model with a system of ordinary differential equations that describes the main population dynamics observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. A PINN approach for the simple SIRD model was proposed by Malinzi et al. [11], and a PINN approach for an SIR-based vaccination model was described by Torku et al. [26]. In contrast, Zeroual et al. [28] compared different pure deep learning models for forecasting COVID-19 cases and found the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) algorithm to be superior.",1.0,case,True
40,"Raissi et al. [17] explain that PINNs are neural networks that embed physics as a regularization term in the loss function. They say that given a sufficient number of data points and an expressive neural network architecture, they can achieve good approximation accuracy if the given differential equation is well-posed and has a unique solution. PINNs can also be viewed as a surrogate model for solving differential equations by incorporating additional data or as a data-driven correction (or even discovery) of the underlying physical system. One motivation for this hybrid approach can be seen in the observed non-compliance of some individuals with social distancing (or physical distancing) and hygiene rules. This behavior is difficult to formulate in ODEs, but it is included in the neural network training data.",1.0,social,True

42,"Shaier et al. [22] use the term Disease-Informed Neural Networks (DINN) to refer to a type of PINN-based neural network that can be applied to increasingly complex systems of differential equations describing various known infectious diseases. The DINN formulation learns both the representation of the underlying system as a neural network and also performs a calibration (called `Inverse Parameter Estimation') for the assumed ODE system model.

43,"As our PINN operates based on transmission and transition dynamics in a population affected by COVID-19, estimates transmission rate parameters, and incorporates a transmission rate that can incorporate remedial measures, such as quarantine and contact restrictions, our PINN can be described as a special type of EINN designed to predict COVID-19 incidence. Because our PINN uses a system of differential equations to learn the parameters that generate it, this PINN can also be considered a DINN. Our approach of using PINN-identified parameters of an ODE system to predict infection and hospitalization rates by using the PINN itself in a slightly modified form and a numerical method of NSFD is innovative. The uniqueness of our approach lies in the fact that we use our PINN for parameter identification and give it a second input of initial compartment size data to generate accurate future compartment size scenarios, and then apply a purely nu-",1.0,transmission,True

The interested reader may also check that the equilibrium points of the ODE model also appear in the proposed NSFD-scheme. We recall that schemes such as those based on Runge-Kutta methods [5] can produce `false' or `spurious' fixed-points, which are not fixed points of the original ODE system, cf. [14]. Finally, we will determine the so-called denominator function, such that we obtain the correct long-time behavior. We refer to [27], where we established an NSFD scheme for a similar compartment model as here. We implemented a simultaneous parameter estimation using a nonlinear least squares minimization of the error between time series compartment size data and the result of the NSFD-based integration of the respective system of ODEs. This does not equal the data or residual loss of our PINN approach used in this paper. With the optimized parameters and the NSFD scheme, we generated future COVID-19 scenarios.

As a consequence, our validation does not consist of a sensitivity or specificity analysis, which is typically conducted for supervised neural networks.

So in the context of COVID-19, the term long-term prediction can be associated with the prediction of one following wave that is dominated by infections with a specific variant of the virus. A short-term prediction can be described as a forecast of e.g. the next local peak within a wave then. Another interpretation of a short-term prediction is a forecast based on certain most current data, which could be data referring to the last experienced wave or high peak during the pandemic. In our following validation, we do not restrict the training data to the most recent peak of the omicron wave but still incorporate all three experienced peaks during the omicron wave into our training data.

495,"As shown in Fig. 7, the time-variability with a sine function in the transmission rate leads to more than one peak over the course of time. Nonetheless, only one peak is detectable per wave, as in our previous predictions with the NSFD scheme. Using c ,"" 0.07, we have maxima in the 38th and 72nd regarded week, which correspond to late February and late October 2023. With c "","" 0.05, the maxima are reached in the 39th and 71st regarded week. Using c "","" 0.03, the peaks are attained in the 42nd and 70th regarded week. It is interesting to note that the second reached peak is higher than the first one in all three cases, but the difference in peak height is approximately 30,000 for c "","" 0.07, 15,000 for c "","" 0.05, and 3000 for c "","" 0.03. Moreover, the first observed peak is achieved at a similar time as in the prediction of the PINN in Fig. 6, where it was reached in the 34th regarded week. If we use  "","" 0.95 in the forecast of the PINN, the peak in Fig. 6 with a size of almost 175,000 is on a similar level as the first observable maximum in the given predictions with the NSFD scheme in Fig. 7.

496,"5 Conclusion and outlook We have presented a data- and physics-driven deep learning algorithm that identifies the transmission parameter  and the parameter , which represents the proportion of transmissibility in the vaccinated population, in a system of ordinary differential equations of a compartmental model describing population dynamics at pandemic times. For this purpose, we used a physics-informed neural network (PINN) whose loss function combines a weighted data loss with a weighted residual loss, which in turn is based on the compartment model applied to the respective current network output.",1.0,transmission,True

502,"Depending on the choice of the transmission rate, the performance of the NSFD scheme varies in approximating the course of the pandemic. Slight changes can lead to large changes in the prediction in terms of the slope and the height reached by the peak of the curve. For example, a 4 · 10-10 increase in transmission risk from 2.00 · 10-9 to 2.04 · 10-9 resulted in a maximum reached two weeks earlier and 0.32 · 106 higher, and a 2 · 10-10 decrease in risk from 2.00 · 10-9 to 1.98 · 10-9 resulted in a maximum reached one week later and 0.9 · 105 smaller (see Fig. 3). The scenarios drawn in our validation part can be described as long-term predictions in the way that data from the outbreak of the pandemic in Germany until the end of 2021 are used in the training set. We did not include data from just a single peak within a wave or a single wave here, as we wanted an algorithm that was adapted to a wide range of virus variants. It should also be adapted to the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in all four seasons, which would not be given if only one wave or even one local peak were included in the training data.",1.0,transmission,True
503,"PINN seem better suited to account for multiple local maxima within a wave than the NSFD scheme, as it is able to capture outliers or small oscillations in a given set of real infection or hospitalisation data and transfer them into its prediction. The clear advantage of PINN over discrete numerical methods is its data orientation, so that it does not rely solely on a mathematical model described by a system of differential equations, which certainly cannot capture all aspects or dynamics of infectious disease. The importance of data loss is evidenced by the fact that predictions of our PINN with assignments  > 0.9, i.e., a clearly dominant influence of the data error MSEU , led to resulting curve predictions that were closer to the reported data of the 30 weeks considered than with assignments  < 0.9. Indeed, our results, particularly those in Table 1, show a sharp decline in PINN performance for decreasing values of the weighting parameter.",1.0,infectious,True
504,"With regard to the prediction of the NSFD scheme, the inclusion of time variability in the transmission rate showed that the NSFD scheme is able to accommodate the prediction of more than one wave, each with a maximum. It is important that the parameters used in the time-dependent transmission function are chosen appropriately. If the NSFD scheme were to be used for an actual prediction of the next wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the parameters c would need to be reliably estimated.",1.0,transmission,True
505,"Nevertheless, the residual term allows us to incorporate systematic knowledge about the spread and transmission dynamics of the disease into our neural network. The differential equations make the network a physically informed and partially mathematical approach. No mathematical model is able to perfectly describe an infectious disease such as COVID-19 because, for example, new mutant variants emerge and intervention measures or population compliance change over time, and not every epidemiological detail relevant to transmission is known. However, the values of certain fixed parameters can be derived from elaborate studies, knowledge of a possible next mutation, intervention, or vaccination strategy can be incorporated, and SIR-type models provide clues to transition dynamics that the neural network can work with. Our variant of the SIR model, i.e., the SVIHR model, was developed because we wanted to include leaky vaccination to account for the reduced infectiousness of individuals in the fully vaccinated case, and we wanted",1.0,spread,True
