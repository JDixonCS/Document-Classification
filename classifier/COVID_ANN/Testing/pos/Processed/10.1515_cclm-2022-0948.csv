5,"Obejctives: Serosurveys can be used to monitor COVID-19 seroprevalence and conduct surveillance. Dried blood spot (DBS), used increasingly as a valuable sample to assay severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies (Ab), has several advantages, particularly in infants, due to the limited amount of blood required and its utility in testing a large number of samples in a limited time-frame. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 IgG Ab prevalence in newborn DBS in the Trentino region of Italy, during the time period January 2020 - December 2021. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were determined in DBS by means of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac IgG ELISA assay (Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany). Results: Analyses included 2,400 DBS from newborns (54% M, 46% F), samples being collected 2-3 days after birth. The first DBS that tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was found in March 2020 and, up to May 2020, only 4 positive results were detected overall.

10,"Since late December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak has been a great challenge for public health worldwide, including countries with well-developed health care systems. Despite warnings and the implementation of public health mitigation strategies by health authorities, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread (1-5). Specific populations at the greatest risk in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic include individuals with other comorbidities (e.g., cardiac, pulmonary, or neurologic diseases; diabetes mellitus; obesity or immunosuppression), the elderly, pregnant/postpartum women, and infants [1-3]. The prompt and accurate identification of all infected individuals is of crucial importance in controlling SARS-CoV-2 rapid transmission, enabling the rapid isolation and traceability of contacts, and containing the risk of spread, regardless of the presence or absence of COVID-19 symptoms [4, 5].",1.0,COVID-19,True

However, Atyeo and colleagues highlighted that SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody transfer, in third-trimester infection, was significantly reduced with respect to influenza- and pertussis-specific antibodies, and SARS-CoV-2-specific transfer was linked to SARS-CoV-2-antibody glycosylation profile alterations [3].",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

Small-scale feasibility studies have evaluated DBS samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection in high-risk populations, using enzyme immunoassays [12, 13].

That this trend seemed to disappear after January 2021 might be due to the cumulative increase in prevalence in reproductive-aged females with SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the vaccination period. In Italy, the vaccination campaign started in January 2021 for healthcare workers and fragile patients and later, in March-April 2021, for reproductive-aged subjects, whilst pregnant women received vaccines lately, from September 2021, due to the required enhanced safety stringency.
