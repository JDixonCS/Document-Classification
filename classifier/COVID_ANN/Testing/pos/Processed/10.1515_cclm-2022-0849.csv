10,"Since November 2019, when severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the virus responsible for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), it has been clear that the rapid identification and isolation of infected subjects was crucial to virus spread containment [1]. Later, the SARS-CoV-2 large scale vaccination campaign strongly changed the natural history of the COVID-19 pandemic by reducing the number of hospitalizations and deaths [2]. However, despite vaccination, viral spread seems to be reinforced by the highly mutated and more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 lineages, such as the Omicron variants [3]. It is therefore still of utmost importance to promptly identify and isolate infected subjects, as a protective strategy towards fragile subjects at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 manifestations [4]. Molecular testing on naso-pharyngeal swabs (NPS), the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 identification, calls for dedicated instrumentation, specialized staff, and has a long turnaround time and low throughput [5, 6]. Several alternatives (e.g., serology, mass spectrometry and imaging) have been proposed as sensitive and specific strategies for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2, and a vast array of point of care testing (POCT) and laboratory-based immunoassays have been evaluated with a view to helping laboratories maximize efficiency in this dramatic scenario [7].",1.0,respiratory,True

16,"and commercialized, but their performance has often failed to meet the WHO criteria [8], since their sensitivity is often lower than 80% and specificity lower than 97% in symptomatic individuals [9]. On the contrary, laboratory-based immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2 antigen have proven to be a valid alternative to NPS molecular testing, since their sensitivity and specificity are higher than 80 and 97%, respectively. Moreover, with respect to molecular testing they have a lower turnaround time, a higher throughput and call for a more simple sample management process [10]. To this end, SARS-CoV-2 antigen laboratory-based immunoassays might represent a sustainable solution in large-scale testing for the screening of populations (e.g. schools, hospitals) at a high risk of viral spread. Considering all these aspects, recently, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Working Group on SARS-CoV-2 updated previous indications for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2, recommending the use of different diagnostic strategies in specific clinical settings, such as labbased molecular testing in high risk populations (e.g. symptomatic patients), POC-based molecular assays or labbased antigen immunoassays in low risk subjects (asymptomatic, hospital admission/contact tracing) or in epidemiologic surveys and population screening setting, along with tentative indications for identification of new lineages and/ or sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2 [11].",1.0,symptomatic,True
17,"In addition to the better testing strategy to adopt, to ensure sustainability, it is important to also consider aspects such as sample type, collection and handling before the analysis. Saliva, self-collected in a standardized way, has proven a valid alternative to NPS, saving time and resources during the collection phase and ensuring molecular results as accurate as those obtained with NPS [12]. Saliva has been recommended especially in asymptomatic subjects and general population screening or to test symptomatic patients when upper or lower respiratory tract samples cannot be collected or for shortage of molecular tests [11]. However, independently from the type of sample collected, sample handling before analysis is still a concern in terms of staff safety, environmental contamination and accuracy of results [13].",1.0,asymptomatic,True

The differences between the two analytical principles may explain these data (e.g. Target amplification for molecular testing but not for Ag searching). However high Ct values suggest a low viral load, generally observed after seven or more days from symptoms onset, or in the very early phases of infection [14]. Despite this limitation, CLEIA saliva antigen testing has a sensitivity higher than the 80% level recommended by the WHO [8]. In agreement with Kobayashi et al. [27], we found antigen false positive results in saliva samples. False positive results were obtained among HCW, and in four of them who collected more than one saliva sample, the antigen concentrations were comparable also one week or more later, thus suggesting the potential presence of interfering molecules. We then tested the hypothesis that heterophilic antibodies might be the interfering molecule. The decrease in Ag concentration found after HBT treatment in all (but one) HCW saliva samples, could support this hypothesis.
