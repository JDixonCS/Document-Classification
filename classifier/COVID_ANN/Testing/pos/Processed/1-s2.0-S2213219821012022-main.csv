The rates of 71 COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and mortality in relation to preexisting AR and/or asthma 72 were assessed based on adjusted generalized linear models. We further analyzed the impact of 73 long-term AR and/or asthma medications on the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and 74 mortality. 75 Results 76 AR patients of all ages had lower positive rates of SARS-Cov-2 tests (RR:0.75, 95% CI: 0.6977 0.81, p<0.001), with lower susceptibility in males (RR: 0.74, 95%CI: 0.65-0.85, p<0.001) than 78 females (RR: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.72-0.9, p<0.001).
