15,"21 Abstract 22 Background / Objectives The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 is a serious public 23 health issue. Large-scale surveillance screenings are crucial but can exceed 24 diagnostic test capacities. We set out to optimize test conditions and implemented 25 high throughput pool testing of respiratory swabs into SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. 26 Study design In preparation for pool testing, we determined the optimal pooling 27 strategy and pool size. In addition, we measured the impact of vortexing prior to 28 sample processing, compared pipette- and swab-pooling method as well as the 29 sensitivity of three different PCR assays. 30 Results Using optimized strategies for pooling, we systematically pooled 55,690 31 samples in a period of 44 weeks resulting in a reduction of 47,369 PCR reactions. In 32 a low prevalence setting, we defined a preferable pool size of ten in a two-stage 33 hierarchical pool testing strategy. Vortexing of the swabs increased cellular yield by a 34 factor of 2.34, and sampling at or shortly after symptom onset was associated with 35 higher viral loads. By comparing different pooling strategies, pipette-pooling was 36 more efficient compared to swab-pooling. 37 Conclusions For implementing pooling strategies into high throughput diagnostics, 38 we recommend to apply a pipette-pooling method, using pool sizes of ten samples, 39 performing sensitivity validation of the PCR assays used, and vortexing swabs prior 40 to analyses. Our data shows, that pool testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection is feasible 41 and highly effective in a low prevalence setting.",1.0,spread,True

D: The mean positivity rate per week of tests performed at the University 162 Hospital of Cologne and in Germany (as published [11]) are shown. 163 164 165 3.2 Pooling method and sensitivity of the PCR assays 166 Pool testing requires optimal sample conditions in order to minimize false negative 167 results. Pre-analytic factors can influence the test results. We could not detect a 168 significant difference in viral loads indicated by Ct-values comparing oropharyngeal 169 swabs with combined nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. However, samples taken in the 170 late phase of infection had significantly lower viral loads compared to earlier 171 timepoints (Supplementary Figure 2A and B). Therefore, pool testing needs to be 172 sensitive and safe in detecting even low virus concentrations. We investigated 173 whether vortexing increases the number of cells released from the swabs (Figure 174 2A). We measured the -globin-gene concentration in the medium of n,33 swabs 175 without vortexing and of the same specimens after 5 seconds of vortexing. The 176 average increase of -globin concentration after vortexing was 2.34-fold (95% CI 177 1.622-3.057; p,""0.0001). In addition, we could detect SARS-CoV-2 in three 178 specimens in which vortexing reduced the Ct-value from 33.39 to 32.79, from 28.50 179 to 28.19 and from 35.58 to 32.87, respectively. 180""",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
