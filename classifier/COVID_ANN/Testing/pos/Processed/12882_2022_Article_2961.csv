7,"Methods: We used data from adult HD patients treated at regional institutions of a global provider in Latin America (LatAm) and North America who contracted COVID-19 in 2020 before SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were available.

17,"Background People with kidney failure treated by dialysis are at a high risk of experiencing serious complications if affected by COVID-19. Reports have estimated 40% to 70% of dialysis patients who contracted COVID-19 were hospitalized and 11% to 34% died during timeframes before SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were available [1- 9]. During 2020, the mortality rate in the United States dialysis population was estimated to have increased by 18% compared to 2019 [10]. The majority assessments of mortality in dialysis patients with COVID-19 have limited follow up timeframes for assessing outcomes. Although useful, the timeframes generally investigated do not provide an understating of outcomes overall, as well as in distinct shorter and longer periods after COVID-19. Ultimately, this might be limiting our understanding of the profiles and predictors of outcomes in this special population.",1.0,COVID-19,True
18,"In many countries, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have fortunately become readily available and are being rolled out to the communities [11, 12]. Nonetheless, SARSCoV-2 vaccines have been shown to create a smaller antibody response among dialysis patients [13, 14], and a proportion of the population has not been vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2, and may never be due to various reasons (e.g. medical/religious contraindications, vaccine hesitancy) [11, 12, 15, 16]. Further establishment of models to identify the predictors of outcomes in unvaccinated dialysis patients continues to be warranted, and as sufficient follow up data becomes available, investigations determining the profiles and predictors of mortality in vaccinated dialysis patients will also be needed.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
19,"Through experiences in direct patient care in the pandemic, the physician authors made anecdotal observations that dialysis patients with COVID-19 generally experienced the outcome of death either very quickly (within 14 days), or after prolonged periods of intensive care (often>30 days). Ultimately, it was hypothesized this might be signaling distinct causes and predictors of early or prolonged mortality in COVID-19. This investigation aimed to evaluate the profiles and predictors of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients with COVID-19, overall, as well as considering shorter-, intermediate-, and longer-term follow up periods.",1.0,pandemic,True

22,"In LatAm and North America, we used data collected during the provision of routine medical care in dialysis patients. All data was de-identified for the purposes of the parallel analyses. The EuCliD database was used for capturing data in the Latin America cohort as part of Fresenius Medical Care's quality improvement and management programs in all NephroCare clinics utilizing EuCLiD [17]. EuCLiD governance has established protocols and procedures for use of clinical data from NephroCare clinics for secondary research purposes. Data was only collected from patients who provided informed consent for their data to be collected into EuCliD and the data was de-identified by the LatAm investigator. The Fresenius Medical Care North America Knowledge Center Data Warehouse was used for capturing data in the North America cohort from clinics in the Fresenius Kidney Care network. In North America, data was collected from patients treated in the United States under a protocol approved by New England Independent Review Board (NEIRB; Needham Heights, MA, United States); NEIRB determined the analysis of the North America cohort was exempt due to use of data de-identified by the North America investigator that no longer contained protected health information and consent was not required per title 45 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations part 46.104(d)(4) (NEIRB# 1-1439054-1).

23,Patient eligibility We included data from adult (age18 years) patients with kidney failure who were suspected to have COVID19 before 02-Dec-2020 and received1 outpatient HD treatment (inclusive of hemodiafiltration) before COVID-19 presentation and did not change to a home,1.0,COVID-19,True

27,Dependent variables The primary outcome (dependent variable) was all-cause death any time after COVID-19 presentation.

We used the same logic for time at risk and minimum follow up as with death any time after COVID-19 presentation. Patients who had a death event in a preceding period were censored from the dataset for analysis performed in the subsequent predefined follow-up period. Therefore, patients who died within 0-14 days after COVID-19 presentation were removed from analyses of outcomes 15-30 and>30 days after COVID-19 presentation.

This prior analysis also showed that clinical and laboratory values>14 days before COVID-19 presentation were representative of each patient's ""normal"" physiology before the onset of COVID-19 [18].

This finding may be related to differences in the timing of outcomes and the number of patients used in the model development.

In both regions, age and vintage were top predictors of death in all timeframes and the nutrition markers of albumin and creatinine were top predictors for every timeframe except 15-30 days after presentation. The top predictors of shorter-and intermediate-term mortality after COVID-19 appeared to include unique patient attributes (e.g. higher BMI and/or male sex) that were not top predictors for longer-term mortality. Despite the consistencies, there were several regional distinctions identified.

Although traditional techniques can provide a simple interpretation for a population, information gain is often lost, and unacceptable generalization can occur. Non-linear modeling, such as the machine learning techniques we utilized, can consider the effects for continuous variables without categorization and do not require arbitrary assumptions in linear relationships [25]. It is worthwhile to mention there have been advancements in predictive modeling techniques in recent years, and deep learning methods might have the potential to perform even better than the machine learning methods chosen by us due to the XGBoost model's ability to account for collinearity and missingness [28, 29]. A limitation of these machine and deep learning models are that the outputs can be less intuitive on a population level. In our case, we report the SHAP values in log odds (i.e. the logarithm of the odds ratio) with average population risks being provided in absolute values that only show relative importance of a factor, yet not the direction of the association.
