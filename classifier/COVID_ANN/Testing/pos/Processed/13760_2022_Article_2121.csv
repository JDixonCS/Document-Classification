5,"Abstract Introduction Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction which is typically presented with muscle weakness and excessive fatigability. Majority of MG patients require long-term immune suppression. Our aim was to analyze the frequency and severity of COVID-19 infection in MG patients, as well as the frequency of vaccinated MG patients against SARS-CoV-2. Methods We included 125 MG patients from the central Belgrade municipalities--60% females, age at MG onset 50.1±19.7 years, age at testing 61.7±16.8 years, anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR) positive 78% and muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) positive 8.6%. Results One-third of our MG patients had a COVID-19 infection and they were younger compared to those without verified COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 infection was registered in 28% of MG patients, mostly in elder subjects with comorbidities such as cardiac diseases and malignancies. MG worsening was noted in 21% of patients during/after COVID-19 and 42% had COVID-19 sequelae. Majority of MG patients were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (almost 70%). Vaccination was more common among MG patients with diabetes and in those with a milder form of MG. The most common types of vaccines were Sinopharm (42%) and Pfizer-BioNTech (25.6%). Adverse events were observed in 36% of vaccinated patients, with flu-like symptoms (77%) and local reactions (13%) being the most common ones. MG worsening was noticed in 5 (5.8%) patients after vaccination. Conclusion COVID-19 has placed a significant new burden for MG patients. Elder MG patients and patients with comorbidities are in higher risk of having adverse outcome following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Percentage of vaccinated MG patients was higher than in general Serbian population.",1.0,disease,True

14,"It is supposed that COVID-19 infection might affect MG patients in several ways. For instance, MG is considered as an immune-mediated disease which could have a bidirectional interaction with infections such as COVID-19. In particular, viruses (and other infectious pathogens) are one of the major environmental triggers of autoimmunity [6, 7]. Before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, viral and bacterial respiratory and urinary tract infections were the most frequent",1.0,COVID-19,True

For instance, only 32% of our MG patients were treatment-free after a 10-year follow-up period [8]. On the other hand, it has been shown that several medications, including the ones used for COVID-19 treatment (hydroxychloroquine and several antibiotics), and vaccines, can trigger MG exacerbation and myasthenic crisis in these patients [9, 10].",1.0,COVID-19,True

The diagnosis of MG was established according to clinical, pharmacological, electrophysiological and immunoserological MGFA criteria [13, 14]. In this way, we have initially identified 220 patients who fulfilled the criteria. Forty-seven patients were excluded after a minimum of two attempts of telephone-contact, 43 patients refused to participate, three patients died before the COVID-19 pandemic, one patient had the diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and one patient had his MG diagnosis revised.

23,"During the period of two months (November and December of 2021), data were collected using telephone questionnaires. This specifically designed questionnaire comprised four main domains: MG status at the time of testing, data about COVID-19 infection, data about vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, while the fourth section was filled only in the case of death. All data were obtained from patients or from specific contact persons if the patient had previously died. Severity of the disease was evaluated using the MGFA classification, and further dichotomized into mild (I-IIIA) and a more severe form (IIIB-V) of the disease [14]. Applied treatment modalities were divided into main groups: cholinesterase inhibitors, corticosteroids, non-steroidal immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine, cyclosporin A), therapeutic plasma exchange (PLEx) or intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) and experimental study drugs (efgartigimod, mezagitamab, and rozanolixizumab). Patients who had a verified COVID-19 infection from March 6, 2020 (first identified COVID-19 case in The Republic of Serbia) to the moment of testing were guided to the second domain of the questionnaire. Clinical severity of COVID-19 infection was divided into six categories (from ""asymptomatic"" to ""mechanical ventilation needed"") according to the WHO clinical progression scale [15], and further dichotomized into mild (""no hospitalization"") and severe COVID-19 form (""hospitalized patients""). All patients who were vaccinated against SARSCoV-2 provided information about the type of vaccines they received. MG worsening was considered related to the infection/vaccination if happened during 6 weeks after first symptoms of COVID-19 or 6 weeks after any dose of the vaccine. Finally, heteroanamnestic data were provided for patients who had died, and it included the time of death, cause of death and its relation to COVID-19 infection.",1.0,COVID-19,True

On the other hand, previous studies from Turkey and France reported significantly lower prevalence of COVID-19 infection (0.96% and 13.5%, respectively) among patients with MG [19, 20]. The basic cause of these differences might be the disparity between the study conducting time and the course of the pandemic, as well as different prevalence among general population in these countries.

However, observed contrast in reported disease deterioration could, at least partially, be explained by sociodemographic and clinical inter- and intra-cohort differences of comprised patients. For instance, our study included all MG patients from one territory, regardless of disease severity and remission status.",1.0,COVID-19,True
167,"Post-COVID sequelae were present in 42% of our patients with MG. These data are in accordance with a general population study of Hirschtick et al., where post-COVID sequelae occurred in almost one half of the patients that had COVID19 [27].",0.0,,False

170,"In our MG cohort, 69% of patients were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, which is higher compared to the general population of the Republic of Serbia (47% on February 23rd, 2022) and the WHO world data (55%) [28]. The main reason for this higher percentage of vaccination in our MG population could be the well-established advisory role of doctors, as well as patients' fear of getting a more severe COVID-19 form due to both their primary autoimmune disease and medical immunosuppression. However, a significant part of MG population was not vaccinated due to different reasons. It means that vaccinerelated skepticism is still present among MG population, and even doctors, mostly due to the revolutionary rapid development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines [29]. It is of note that MG worsening after vaccination, analyzed by patient self-evaluation, was present in only 6% of vaccinated patients, primarily in patients on non-steroidal immunosuppressants and experimental study drug regimens. These findings were similar to the Italian cohort data where MG-ADL scores did not worsen in most of the patients after vaccination [22]. The main reason for primary disease worsening after vaccination in our patients could be the fact that this group of patients was generally presented with a more severe form of MG. Interestingly, compared to disease worsening after vaccination, MG exacerbation after COVID-19 infection was noted only in a slightly higher number of patients (nine (10.5%) of 89 vaccinated patients vs. five (11.6%) of 43 patients who had COVID-19 infection). Indeed, according to previous data MG worsening appears to be uncommon in COVID-19, appearing in only 10-15% of infected patients [25], which is similar to our findings.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
171,"The main limitation of our study is the telephone-based approach of obtaining patients' data since this may cause a recall bias. Further prospective longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate MG course and prognosis during and after the COVID-19 pandemic era. Despite these limitations, the study comprises a relatively large cohort of MG patients and provides useful data about the COVID-19 infection and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in a rare immune-mediated disease such as MG, offering valuable data for treatment and care of these patients.",1.0,COVID-19,True

173,"COVID-19 has placed a significant new burden for MG patients. Elder MG patients and patients with comorbidities (especially with cardiovascular and malignant diseases) are in higher risk of having adverse outcome following SARSCoV-2 infection. Percentage of vaccinated MG patients was higher compared to general Serbian population, and MG worsening after vaccination was mostly seen among vaccinated patients with more severe MG forms.",1.0,COVID-19,True
