8,"ABSTRACT Background There has been considerable expansion in online postal self-s­ampling (OPSS) STI services in many parts of the UK, driven by increasing demand on sexual health services and developments in diagnostics and digital health provision. This shift in service delivery has occurred against a backdrop of reduced funding and service fragmentation and the impact is unknown. We explored characteristics of people accessing and using OPSS services for STIs in the UK, the acceptability of these services and their impact on sexual health inequalities. Methods A scoping review was conducted of studies published in English-­language based on pre-a­ greed inclusion/exclusion criteria, between 01 January 2010 and 07 July 2021. Nine databases were searched, and 23 studies that met the eligibility criteria were included. Studies were appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results Study designs were heterogeneous, including quantitative, qualitative and mixed-­methods analyses. The majority were either evaluating a single-s­ite/self-­ sampling provider, exploratory or observational and of variable quality. Few studies collected comprehensive user demographic data. Individuals accessing OPSS tended to be asymptomatic, of white ethnicity, women, over 20 years and from less deprived areas. OPSS tended to increase overall STI testing demand and access, although return rates for blood samples were low, as was test positivity. There were varied results on whether services reduced time to treatment. OPSS services were acceptable to the majority of users. Qualitative studies showed the importance of trust, confidentiality, discretion, reliability, convenience and improved patient choice. Conclusion OPSS services appear highly acceptable to users. However, uptake appears to be socially patterned and some groups who bear a disproportionate burden of poor sexual health in the UK are under-r­epresented among users. Current provision of online self-­sampling could widen health inequalities, particularly where other options for testing are limited. Work is needed to fully evaluate the impact and cost-­effectiveness of OPSS services.",1.0,asymptomatic,True
9,"INTRODUCTION `Home testing' whereby an individual tests for STIs and/or blood-­borne viruses (BBVs) remote from traditional healthcare settings, encompasses user self-s­ampling (the laboratory processes and tests the samples) or self-t­esting (the user tests their own samples).1 The most widely used option in the UK is online postal self-­sampling (OPSS) in which users order specimen collection kits via the internet.

OPSS is increasingly provided in high-­income countries.2-4 England's earliest online chlamydia testing services began in 2006,5 but the other devolved nations of the UK introduced OPSS rather later.6-8 The BASHH recommends online testing and care provision as an adjunct to in-p­ erson services to increase choice for service users.9",1.0,,True
16,"The UK had seen a sustained rise in diagnoses of several STIs, and increase in demand for sexual health service (SHS) consultations, until the start of the COVID-­19 pandemic.10 Between 2015 and 2019 in England, there was a 23% increase in the number of SHS consultations (3 143 144-3 852 121). Total sexual health screens for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and HIV increased by 31% (1 657 425 to 2 175 525) in this period. Internet-­ based services have assumed an increasing proportion of consultations and screening activity. In 2018-2019, while overall consultations and tests in England rose by 7% and 10%, respectively, consultations and STI screens provided by internet-­based services surged by 94% and 69%.10 This trend of an increasing proportion of testing and consultations being accessed and provided online has accelerated as a result of the COVID-1­9 pandemic.11 Young people, people from ethnic minority groups, men who have sex with men (MSM), people who are gender diverse, and those living in more deprived areas have borne a disproportionate burden of STIs",1.0,pandemic,True

19,"Some evidence suggests that OPSS might improve access to STI services for those who feel uncomfortable or struggle to attend face-­to-­face services,19 and might cost less than in-p­ erson care.20 21 However, relatively little is known about the characteristics of people who use OPSS and the existing literature is heterogeneous and has not previously been comprehensively reviewed. With a drive towards further online sexual health provision in the UK,22 the pre-e­ xisting unequal burden of sexual ill health in the population and well-d­escribed inequalities in access to sexual healthcare, it is important to understand the impact of this shift in service delivery. We aimed to evaluate the current evidence on access to and usage of OPSS services. We have restricted our scope to the UK because online care has been relatively mainstreamed in at least one country (England) for many years and sexual healthcare is provided free at the point of access without the need for specialist referral. Our specific objectives were to: (1) describe characteristics of people accessing and using STI self-s­ampling services in the UK; (2) assess whether OPSS increases demand for testing; (3) assess the impact of OPSS on clinical outcomes; (4) assess levels of acceptability of OPSS services in the UK.",1.0,clinical,True

122,"Acceptability of OPSS services Qualitative research showed the importance of trust, confidentiality, discretion, reliability, convenience and improved patient choice in ensuring the successful use of OPSS,51 52 and between 71.1% and 98.0% of individuals surveyed expressed that they were pleased with and found these services acceptable.38 44 45",0.0,,False
123,"Economics Although this review did not specifically set out to evaluate the economic outcomes of OPSS services, only one study included any costing data.33 This study, evaluating the impact of online testing across specialist SHS in two London boroughs found that, although there was an increase in the total annual cost of STI testing following the introduction of online testing, the average cost per test and diagnosis decreased.33",1.0,,True
124,"DISCUSSION Although evaluations of OPSS of variable quality were found, we did not identify any large-s­cale, multicentre robust studies. Available evidence suggests that OPSS services appear to be more likely to be used by, and acceptable to, asymptomatic individuals who are predominately women, over 20 years of age, residents in less deprived areas and of white ethnicities, when compared with clinic-b­ ased populations. There is preliminary evidence that people from groups experiencing a disproportionate burden of STIs use OPSS less than other groups. The heterogeneity of the included studies prevented full evaluation of clinical outcomes.",1.0,asymptomatic,True
125,"Online services tend to be targeted at asymptomatic individuals who do not have other sexual health needs. The ability for asymptomatic people to manage their care needs remotely is an important and useful contribution to detect symptomless STIs, in order to enable treatment of the index patient and partner notification, and reduce morbidity and onward transmission. However, asymptomatic users reported higher risk behaviours in some studies,5 39 and there were no data on the impact of using OPSS on future sexual behaviour. In addition, there was insufficient evidence to be able to establish the impact of OPSS on treatment and partner notification outcomes.",1.0,asymptomatic,True
126,"Women were more likely than men to access and return STI self-­ sampling kits in the majority of studies.20 32 35 39 40 46 For services that provided accessibility information by sexual orientation, MSM seemed to be successfully using OPSS services.32 46 This finding is consistent with those from an OPSS in Canada.53 Certain minority",0.0,,False
127,"ethnic groups such as black Caribbean, black African and mixed ethnicities, who are also key populations who are at higher risk of poor sexual health, were under-­represented in OPSS users,11 perhaps due to a preference for face-t­o-­face care.52",1.0,,True
128,"Some services appear to appropriately reach younger people, but other services were more popular with those aged over 20 years.35 This could be because younger people are more likely to live at home and have concerns about parents finding a test kit delivered through the post.54 Using chlamydia as an exemplar, chlamydia has formed 49% of new STI diagnoses in 2019, yet there has been a 13% reduction in tests completed by young people since 2015.11 Chlamydia is the most commonly reported STI in the UK, and disproportionately affects young people from deprived areas,42 so it is crucial to ensure services are targeting these groups within their region. Despite this, recent research shows that both men (adjusted OR (aOR): 1.36 (95% CI: 1.35 to 1.39), p<0.001) and women (aOR: 1.32 (95% CI: 1.31 to 1.33), p<0.001) living in the least deprived quintile were more likely to use OPSS services for chlamydia screening than those from the most deprived quintile.55",1.0,area,True
129,"Understanding inequalities in access and usage of OPSS services requires services to collect comprehensive sociodemographic data. Of the 15 included studies, only 2 collected gender, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation and IMD data.32 37 Most studies included categories such as `other' ethnicity or sexual orientation and though a few included trans participants, only one described people of non-­binary, gender fluid or other genders.43 This data gap results in not only a skewed understanding of the impact of STIs on minorities, but also `facilitates the erasure of communities'.18 Further, the inter-r­elations between demographic groups have not been sufficiently examined in these studies despite reference in the literature20 42 56 (eg, 4, 11, 65).",1.0,flu,True
130,"Return rates of blood samples that were sufficient for testing were relatively low, and in keeping with findings from the national HIV self-s­ampling service.57 Overall test positivity was lower in OPSS services compared with clinic-b­ ased services.32 36 This is in keeping with, but more marked than, findings from both selective and unselective national datasets.10 57 As highlighted within one study, the low positive predictive value (PPV) for home-­based BBV testing is concerning36 and requires further evaluation from both a cost-­effectiveness and well-­being perspective.",1.0,positive,True
131,"To our knowledge, this is the first review to explore the accessibility of OPSS services in the UK. The inclusion of qualitative as well as quantitative studies ensured that both acceptability and core themes regarding people's access to and use of services could be explored. The included studies were heterogeneous in design using a variety of methodologies which added value to the review. By excluding hypothetical studies, acceptability and barriers to service use are indicative of the real-l­ife experience of online service users.",0.0,,False
132,"Fourteen of 23 studies took place in London and no studies were conducted in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, so findings may not be generalisable to all of the UK. This review did not set out to evaluate partner notification or economic outcomes of OPSS services, but the authors observed that there was a dearth of information on these within the studies that were included in this review. This study only focused on the UK setting as it was focusing on access, and the infrastructure of SHS provision in the UK is different to other settings. However, the findings relating to acceptability and convenience are similar to those reported in systematic review and synthesis of qualitative research on OPSS services.54",0.0,,False

138,"With the extensive expansion in provision of OPSS services in recent years, a large-s­cale, multicentre evaluation is needed to determine their cost-­effectiveness and impact on access, clinical outcomes and service delivery. In addition to more targeted evaluations, it would be beneficial to conduct a holistic evaluation across all service modalities (including face-t­o-­face services). Clinical outcomes are key to understanding the cost-­effectiveness of these services and there is limited research into this important factor. Further research is required to understand why people aged under 20 years have lower uptake, and whether this is related to, for example, an individual's experience of autonomy, competence and relatedness59 and how awareness and access can be improved for these individuals.60",1.0,clinical,True
