72,Introduction,0.0,,False
73,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States and China reported difficulties in access to testing services for sexually transmitted infections (STI) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (1, 2). Disruptions in access to sexual health care services were reported in many other countries, including in the Netherlands (3). Lower testing rates were observed in a context where MSM remained sexually active during lockdown situations and social distancing measures in the Netherlands, as to the United Kingdom reported sexual activity remained high (4).",1.0,COVID-19,True
74,"In recent years, new opportunities for STI/HIV testing include commercial home-based alternatives, which include self-tests and self-sampling tests (5). To extend clinic-based care, home-based sexual health care could be a cost-effective possibility when compared with health care in a clinic, as demonstrated in the United Kingdom (6-8). Home-based sexual health care consists of self-collection of samples, and additional online sexual health counseling, for example about PrEP and chemsex. Home-based alternatives for testing can overcome perceived and experienced barriers among MSM for STI/HIV testing at STI clinics such as privacy, confidentiality, and time-constraints (9, 10). Home-based care options enable continual access to care for MSM who seek sexual health care, and due to COVID-19 restrictions, personal needs, or other reasons, experience barriers to clinic-based testing or sexual health counseling. Insights into added value remains limited on combining STI and HIV tests in complete homebased sexual health care, with high quality STI/HIV diagnostics and additional sexual health care opportunities, such as sexual health counseling on safe sex, PrEP and, chemsex (11, 12). An ongoing study from the United States identified a lack of counseling additional to home-based testing among male couples (13), but acceptability of sexual health counseling was not specified.",1.0,COVID-19,True
75,"Self-sampling STI and HIV tests are provided by commercial initiatives in the Netherlands, with the main challenge being the lack of provision of complete sexual health care services, i.e., including testing for both STI and HIV, sexual health counseling, treatment, and partner services (14). Such comprehensive sexual health care is provided by location-based STI clinics. Selfcollection of samples for STI and HIV testing outside of a clinical setting has not yet been implemented in sexual health care by Dutch STI clinics (15, 16).",1.0,clinical,True
76,"The current study assessed the opportunities for homebased sexual health care in MSM who previously attended clinic-based sexual health care. Therefore, we assessed the intention, behavioral determinants (e.g., attitude, social norms, self-efficacy) and acceptability of self-sampling testing and online sexual health counseling.",1.0,social,True

79,"In the Netherlands, STI/HIV testing and sexual health care is organized via STI clinics (Public Health Services), offering free of charge care to high-risk groups, including MSM. Other care options include the general practitioner or hospital, though here patients may need to pay for STI and HIV tests. In November 2020 we invited 424 MSM by email to participate in an online survey. After two reminders were sent, respondents were able to complete the survey until February 2021. This was a cross-sectional study with a convenience sample. Respondents in this study had participated in a previous study before the COVID-19 pandemic (2018) and were recruited during their regular consultation by an STI nurse in one of nine STI clinics in the Netherlands (Supplementary Table S1). The invited study cohort consisted of respondents who previously consented to participate in future studies (Supplementary Table S2).

A multiple response question assessed where participants tested the last time (e.g., at general practitioner, STI clinic, hospital, or, by a self-sampling test). Self-sampling testing was defined as self-collection of specimens analyzed by a laboratory for the results, whereas results of self-testing is interpreted by the individual (5). The survey defined selfsampling STI and HIV testing as ""taking a urine sample, anorectal and oropharyngeal swabs and blood sampling by fingerstick"".

For analyses, CAI was defined as either receptive or insertive anal intercourse without a condom. Casual partners included fuckbuddies, partners of whom they did not know their names, participants of group sex, customers (of sex work), sex workers, and friends. Chemsex was defined as having used one or more of the following drugs: crystal meth, cocaine, 2-CB, 3MMC, 4-FA, 4-MEC, GHB, GBL, ketamine, MDMA, mephedrone, speed and XTC, before or during sex in the past 6 months (19).",1.0,,True

Subsequently, a Chi-square test was used to compare sociodemographic and sexual behavioral characteristics between recent (past 6 months) and non-recent testers (more than 6 months ago). Self-sampling and participants' behavioral determinants, i.e., intention to use self-sampling tests were presented using descriptive statistics. Attitude, self-efficacy, and intention showed strong (>0.7) Pearson correlations, hence the strongest predictor for behavior according to Theory of Planned Behavior/Reasoned Action Approach (i.e., intention) was chosen as outcome to assess differences between population subgroups. A Shapiro-Wilk test revealed that intention to use self-sampling testing was not normally distributed (p ,"" 0.000). Therefore, a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to compare median intention across sociodemographic and sexual behavioral subgroups. Last, acceptability was demonstrated by descriptive analyses and a Chi-Square test compared several (dis)advantages among participants with low and high intention to use a self-sampling test.

Preferably, home-based care would also be able to extend the reach of sexual health care, by decreasing testing barriers. More research is needed to assess whether home-based sexual healthcare increases the reach of sexual health care in populations who have no previous experience with attending sexual health care.",1.0,positive,True
188,"The uptake of STI/HIV tests has decreased among MSM during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a result of downscaling clinic-based sexual health care and stricter triaging (3). Therefore, this pandemic underlined the need for home-based sexual health care, including STI/HIV testing for MSM (1, 2). Global studies have reported high feasibility and acceptability among MSM of testing outside a clinic (20-22). The current study demonstrated intention to use self-sampling STI/HIV",1.0,COVID-19,True

Several studies have suggested integration of home-based care in existing sexual health care to increase STI/HIV testing uptake and ensure quality of sexual health care (10, 11, 23). Particularly a recent study from the United States, which modeled an increase of HIV incidence when testing in clinical setting is completely replaced by home-based testing (24).

Consistent with results in this paper, we previously established a positive attitude toward self-sampling testing in a cohort of Dutch HIV-positive MSM (16). Therefore, homebased sexual health care should be designed for a diverse and extensive group of MSM who previously attended clinic-based care. An inclusive approach should be accomplished by tailored home-based sexual health care, which would provide with free and easy-to-use tests to tackle perceived barriers (26).",1.0,clinical,True

Since participants mainly identified internet-based options, home-based sexual health care for MSM should provide with online opportunities. Fitting home-based care would consist of ordering self-sampling STI/HIV tests online accompanied with online instructional content. Consequently, previous research recommends use of illustration and detailed verbal instructions when self-sampling testing (28).

Within online sexual health care counseling topics such as PrEP use and STI/HIV testing could be discussed.

228,"This study has several limitations. First, response for this follow-up study sample (36.3%; N ,"" 154) was lower than anticipated. Yet, the sample may be only minimally subject to bias due to loss-to-follow-up as proportions of sociodemographic and sexual behavioral characteristics were similar to the invited study cohort (Supplementary Table S2). Second, the invited study sample included MSM with somewhat higher sexual risk behavior, the median number of sex partners (6 vs. 5, p "","" 0.02) and STI positivity rate were higher (23 vs. 19%, p "","" 0.02) compared to total MSM population who visited the participating STI clinics (19). This slightly affects the generalizability of the results of the study to all MSM who visit an STI clinic. However, we expect that impact on generalizability is minimal as intention to use self-sampling testing was not associated with numbers of sex partners and STI outcome. Generalizability of the results to MSM who did not visit an STI clinic is unknown, but it is possible that the intention to use home-based care and positive attitude toward home-based sexual health care might be lower in this group. Third, at the time of the study integration of home-based sexual health care elements were limited within Dutch STI clinics. Therefore, this study assessed behavioral determinants rather than actual use of self-sampling STI/HIV testing (30). Fourth, the quantitative nature of this study did not allow elaborate qualitative reporting on acceptability. Nevertheless, this study did provide detailed information on acceptability of homebased sexual health care among MSM who previously attended clinic-based sexual health care.""",1.0,positive,True
