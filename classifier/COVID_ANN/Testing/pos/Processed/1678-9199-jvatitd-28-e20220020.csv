8,"Peripheral facial paralysis (PFP) has been shown to be a neurological manifestation of COVID-19. The current study presents two cases of PFP after COVID-19, along with a rapid review of known cases in the literature. Both case reports were conducted following CARE guidelines. We also performed a systematic review of PFP cases temporally related to COVID-19 using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases on August 30, 2021, using a rapid review methodology. The two patients experienced PFP 102 and 110 days after COVID-19 symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nasal samples through reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing. Anosmia was the only other neurological manifestation. PFP was treated with steroids in both cases, with complete subsequent recovery. In the rapid review, we identified 764 articles and included 43 studies. From those, 128 patients with PFP were analyzed, of whom 42.1% (54/128) were male, 39.06% (50/128) female, and in 23 cases the gender was not reported. The age range was 18 to 59 (54.68%). The median time between COVID-19 and PFP was three days (ranging from the first symptom of COVID-19 to 40 days after the acute phase of infection). Late PFP associated with COVID-19 presents mild symptoms and improves with time, with no identified predictors. Late PFP should be added to the spectrum of neurological manifestations associated with the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection as a post COVID-19 condition.",1.0,COVID-19,True

14,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people and threatened global public health [1, 2]. After months of the virus spreading, cases of post-COVID-19 syndrome began to emerge, characterized by signs and symptoms that develop during or after infection, continue for more than 12 weeks, and cannot be explained by any alternative diagnosis. Post-COVID-19 conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems that people experience four or more weeks after being infected with the COVID-19 virus. Syndromes of post-viral manifestations have previously been reported in other pandemic events, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [3].",1.0,COVID-19,True
15,"COVID-19 is a systemic disease that predominantly affects the respiratory system [4]. However, neurological changes may result from systemic complications of the disease, the direct effect of the virus on neurons, or an inflammation of the nervous system [5]. It is known that the SARS-CoV-2 infection is related to encephalopathies, central nervous system inflammatory syndromes, ischemic stroke, and peripheral neurological disorders; this relationship continues even after the acute phase of COVID-19 [6, 7]. Peripheral facial paralysis (PFP) occurs when there is a dysfunction of the facial nerve, usually affected in an inflammatory way, resulting in total or partial paralysis of facial movement. It is characterized by the involvement of the upper and lower areas of the face, which differentiates it from central peripheral paralysis, which only affects the lower portion [8]. It can be primarily referred to as Bell's palsy, with an incidence rate of 15 to 30 cases per 100,000 inhabitants [9] or secondary, caused by metabolic, cerebrovascular, and mainly infectious factors [10].",1.0,COVID-19,True
16,"This type of paralysis has been associated with viral infections, mainly herpes virus [8]. More recently, the association of PFP with SARS-CoV-2 has been reported [5, 11-13]. The diagnosis is made by observing the signs and symptoms. It is not necessary to employ imaging devices because, in this case, the benefits do not outweigh the harm when performing these tests [14].",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
17,"In the present study, we report two cases of late PFP that occurred after COVID-19 in healthcare professionals, along with results of a review of the current literature evaluating PFP patients' demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of COVID-19.",1.0,case,True

A table was used to characterize the articles using the following information: article identification (by year, study site, and authors) and methodological profile of the article.

The patient underwent oro-nasopharyngeal swab sample collection on September 18 for an RT-qPCR test using the Allplex 2019nCoV real-time RT-qPCR kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea). This multiplex assay uses oligonucleotides for the RdRP-gene (RNAdependent RNA polymerase), N-gene (nucleocapsid), and E-gene (envelope) as viral targets, and RNase P-gene (ribonuclease P) as the internal control. CT values  38 were considered positive. CT values were 26 for E-gene, 28 for RdRP-gene, 36 for N-gene, and 26 for RNase P-gene, confirming the positive result for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The pain ceased with the use of dipyrone (the patient could not recall the dosage). The next morning, she noticed lip rhyme deviation, went to an emergency care unit close to her home, and received a clinical diagnosis of Bell's palsy on the left side.

495,"This study describes two cases of late PFP after confirmed COVID-19 infections. In the literature search, we retrieved 43 articles reporting patients with acute paralysis or idiopathic facial weakness associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numerous late cases of Bell's palsy weeks after the COVID-19 diagnosis have likely not been published as related to Sars-CoV-2. In this case, it is necessary to take into account the publication bias [56]. Although a problem may be relevant to the scientific community, many studies are published or not depending on the results.",1.0,case,True
496,"Although facial paralysis has no gender predilection, our two reports involved female patients, as indicated in recent reports on the subject [11, 12, 24, 55]. The pathophysiology of the disease may be related to increased viral replication and dissemination in the axon, leading to demyelination and inflammation [57]. The severity of this condition can be measured by the addition of more neurological events, intensification of initial symptoms, ocular symptoms, and incomplete recovery after three months [5].",1.0,disease,True
497,"In general, the cases we have reported had benign courses with some degree of facial involvement.

As a result of this systematic review, most cases were grade III [17, 25, 38, 44], which means that a large number of patients affected by paralysis had moderate symptoms.",1.0,case,True
501,"The cases presented here diverge from the literature regarding temporality and the symptom itself; in other reports, paralysis has generally been described as the only symptom or as an initial symptom [11, 18, 20, 22, 33, 36, 38, 39, 55].",1.0,case,True
502,"The cases described in this work presented other manifestations, such as cough, body pain, and myalgia. The paralysis occurred four months after symptoms and the COVID-19 diagnosis. The persistence of symptoms after the acute phase of COVID-19 has been discussed and the term long COVID is used for this purpose: when there are lasting effects of the infection after three weeks from the time of diagnosis. The virus can cause permanent damage to various organs, such as the heart, lung, and brain [59]. Therefore, we classify the cases presented here as long COVID.",1.0,case,True
503,"Except for the anosmia presented by the two patients, the association of other neurological manifestations concomitant with the paralysis was not observed. In recent reports, the involvement of the facial nerve - during or after COVID-19 infection - was associated with the absence of deep tendon reflexes, ataxia, hypoesthesia, or paresthesia in the upper and lower limbs, being characteristic signs of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) [60-63].",1.0,COVID-19,True
504,"The World Health Organization, in April 2020, determined that cases with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, GBS, and other acute neuropathies could be associated with SARSCoV-2 infection [5]. Our reported cases do not coincide with the concepts of probable and possible association described in the literature [64]. However, this definition of temporal association can be changed as new events have been reported throughout the pandemic [65].",1.0,case,True
505,"Additionally, no changes in taste have been reported, although ageusia has emerged as one of the common symptoms of COVID-19 and these manifestations are present in cases of peripheral paralysis, when the topography of the lesion reaches the chorda tympani nerve, a branch of the facial nerve [66].",1.0,COVID-19,True
506,"Treatment for paralysis aims to improve the facial mimicry of these patients and prevent sequelae. There is evidence that physiotherapy sessions can offer benefits for recovering facial mobility and improving the functionality of facial expressions, accelerating the recovery process [67]. In addition to physiotherapy sessions, the study patients used corticosteroids. One corticosteroid was associated with an antiviral. In the review, eight patients received the association of antivirals and corticotherapy, in consideration of a possible HSV infection [24, 32, 33, 36, 38]. Another 17 patients used antiviral drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir, valacyclovir, and acyclovir to treat paralysis [11, 25, 51, 53].",0.0,,False
507,"Finally, concerning the duration of symptoms mentioned in other articles on the subject, which ranged from six days for complete recovery [11] to 30 days for partial recovery [38], the total recovery of the facial mimicry of patients described in our report has an uncertain but promising prognosis.",0.0,,False
508,"There is a notable increase in described neurological manifestations including facial paralysis cases, with an onset time that can vary from two days to 60 days.

509,"The limitations of our study are inherent to the types of research included in the rapid review, which do not describe their limitations, making it difficult to compare with cases related globally. Additionally, the difficulty in differentiating isolated paralysis and facial paralysis associated with GBS is detected in the included articles. In our report, it was not possible to perform HSV serology due to lack of a kit in the reference laboratory. Also, MRIs were not performed in the acute period of the onset of facial paralysis. Due to the low CT, it was not possible to perform genetic sequencing of the virus.",1.0,case,True

511,"In conclusion, cases of peripheral facial paralysis have been described in the literature, but they are limited to acute cases with descriptions of up to 60 days in duration. There is a wide variety of clinical protocols and treatments. We report two cases of PFP after confirmed COVID-19 infection, both presenting some symptoms related to COVID-19, with late neurological alteration. Considering that these two cases had no history of labial or genital herpes and that both cases had positive serology (IgG) for cytomegalovirus, this late symptomatology is a hypothesis that it is caused by Sars-Cov-2. The benign course of the disease demonstrated the diversity of complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 and the need for outpatient follow-up to observe possible late manifestations of FPF.",1.0,case,True
