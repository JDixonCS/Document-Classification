6,"Introduction: In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, countries have adopted various degrees of restrictive measures on people to reduce COVID-19 transmission. These measures have had significant social and economic costs. In the absence of therapeutics, and low vaccination coverage, strategies for a safe exit plan from a lockdown are required to mitigate the transmission and simultaneously re-open societies. Most countries have outlined or have implemented lockdown exit plans. The objective of this scoping review is to (a) identify and map the different strategies for exit from lockdowns, (b) document the effects of these exit strategies, and (c) discuss features of successful exit strategies based on the evidence.",1.0,COVID-19,True
7,Methods: A five-step approach was used in this scoping review: (a) identifying the research question and inclusion/ exclusion criteria; (b) searching the literature using keywords within PubMed and WHO databases; (c) study selection; (d) data extraction; (e) collating results and qualitative synthesis of findings.,0.0,,False
8,"Results: Of the 406 unique studies found, 107 were kept for full-text review. Studies suggest the post-peak period as optimal timing for an exit, supplemented by other triggers such as sufficient health system capacity, and increased testing rate.

Studies recommend continued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical distancing, use of facemasks, and hygiene measures, in different combinations when exiting from a lockdown, even after optimal vaccination coverage has been attained.",1.0,distancing,True

This has involved closing borders, closing non-essential workplaces and schools, restrictions on gatherings and movements of people (road, air, sea). Some of the mitigation strategies ranged from complete lockdown as seen in India [2] to moderate strategies like in the United Kingdom supported by increased testing, tracing, and quarantining [3]. Other mitigation measures included age-selective distancing.

19,"To circumvent the challenges faced following the lockdowns, countries have attempted to devise optimal strategies to exit from lockdowns. Many countries have defined graded exit plans with each phase informed by triggers such as case numbers, infection rate, health system capacity, etc. Other countries have relied on seroprevalence studies and increased testing prior to opening up. The phase-wise exit plans are usually structured by type of business, school, and size of gatherings, etc. The timing and containment measures during exit also varied. Almost all exit strategies studied suggest the continued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs- These include physical distancing, use of face mask, and hygiene measures, and other restrictive measures such as stay at home, school closures, travel restrictions, border closures, and steps to address ventilation measures especially in closed spaces) in various combinations suited to country contexts. Countries such as New Zealand and South Korea began relaxing restrictions only after the number of new daily cases reached almost zero.

However, we expect to have covered the majority of published studies. Second, the review has included studies on the effects of exit strategies on COVID19 related outcomes. Effects on other outcomes such as social and economic aspects were not included. Effects of vaccination coverage on opening up weren't studied as literature on this was in early stages while undertaking the review. Recent literature does point to significant effects of existing COVID vaccines on reducing disease severity (hospitalization and deaths) [99], and on newer variants such as Omicron [100]. Improving vaccination coverage thus becomes an important component of exit strategy.
