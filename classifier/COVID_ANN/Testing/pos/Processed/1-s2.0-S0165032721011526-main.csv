The participants were asked to compare their recent sleep and sleep during the first outbreak. The Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used to assess their current insomnia severity.

Emerging infectious diseases epidemics like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome",1.0,COVID-19,True
68,"(SARS), Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) tend to pose a negative impact on sleep quality[8, 9]. With the virus largely under control in China, a new wave of Covid-19 cases could still increase the incidence of sleep disorders in residents. Besides, the effects of the epidemic on sleep and mental health did not have geographical restrictions; a majority (78.1%) of our participants resided near the second outbreak epicenter, and did not present with more sleep disturbances and anxiety than the residents in other areas of Beijing, similarly the residents who lived in other provinces reported no lower risk of poor sleep and anxiety than Beijing residents during the second wave. A previous large cross-sectional study reported postgraduate and students who lived in Hubei province, the center of the first outbreak, had a lower risk of anxiety and depression than undergraduates and students who lived in other provinces in China during the COVID-19 epidemic[10].",1.0,Disease,True
69,"Compared with the first wave of pandemic at the beginning of 2020, residents had shorter sleep duration during the second wave.

Non-epidemic factors such as seasonal variations have been taken into account, as the first outbreak occurred in winter while the second wave broke out in summer. Natural sleep duration is shorter in the summer[11]. However shorter sleep duration may aggravate self-reported poor sleep quality and mental problems[12].",1.0,pandemic,True
70,We explored the factors that could account for sleep disturbance during the second wave. We also observed that factors such as previous insomnia and anxiety-depression were significantly associated with sleep disturbance during the pandemic. Our results were consistent with previous studies in COVID-19 pandemic[13-15]. Besides traditional,1.0,pandemic,True
71,"factors, demographic characteristicsthe effects of control measures are discussed.",1.0,,True
72,"During the early outbreak, few residents had access to nucleic acid testing due to the limited availability of test kits. When Beijing's second outbreak took off, the city immediately ramped up its nucleic acid testing. City authorities conducted a staggering 2.3 million tests on residents in just 12 days[16]. More than half of participants (793,52.5%) underwent nucleic acid testing, and all cases were negative. Overturning traditional assumptions, there has been no evidence showing that mass nucleic acid testing eases anxiety and improves quality of sleep. But participants home quarantined due to travel history to a high risk area were significantly more likely to report sleep disturbance and anxiety. Nationwide surveys conducted in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic found higher prevalence of sleep problems among isolated populations[6, 17] . Although quarantines were frequently effective in protecting the public from the spread of illness, we should weigh carefully the potential benefits of mandatory mass quarantine against the possible psychological costs.",1.0,outbreak,True
73,"However, unlike sleep disturbance and anxiety which are often related to fear of infection at the early stage of the outbreak[18], the present study found that people paid more attention to the collapsing revenues and occupational interference during the second wave of outbreak. Strong restrictive measures to control the pandemic have been impacted the global economy significantly, including rising unemployment and reducing income worldwide[19], which could lead to sleep disturbance and depressive-anxiety disorders[20]. Interestingly, people from different occupations had similar prevalence of",1.0,outbreak,True
74,"sleep disturbance and anxiety symptoms, including careers deeply affected by COVID-19. In the current study, medical workers (44.2%) did not report more severe sleep disturbance. Due to China's successful control of COVID-19, the healthcare system does not seem to be overwhelmed. There have been no infections reported in medical staff during the second outbreak in Beijing, which greatly relieved anxiety and stress for healthcare workers. Besides during the second wave in Beijing, in order to prevent further spreading of COVID-19, walk-in patients had to make hospital appointments in advance. The number of hospital patients deceased than before. The workload of most non-frontline healthcare workers had been significantly reduced. Deeper cognition of COVID-19 and higher educational level in medical staff also seem to have a protective effect against anxiety and depression[21].",1.0,COVID-19,True
75,"Anxiety is an important reason for the occurrence of sleep disorders, and also an independent symptom. It has many of the same influencing factors as sleep disorders, so we also analyzed the influencing factors for the occurrence of anxiety state in the second epidemic. After multivariate logistic regression analyses, we found that in addition to home quarantine and pre-existing insomnia, anxiety-depression symptoms appear to be significant predictors to sleep disturbance and anxiety symptoms; women and people aged under 55 years were independent predictors for anxiety. Previous studies reported females were more likely to have anxiety than men in during the SARS and COVID-19 epidemic[22-24]. Two recent web-based cross-sectional studies also demonstrated that younger subjects were at high risk of psychological problems, such as general anxiety disorder and suicidal thoughts during the COVID-19 pandemic[7, 25]. This study has several limitations. First, a cross-sectional study design during the acute pandemic stage limited the ability to determine the causal inference. The reliability of retrospective data of sleep during the early outbreak is likely to be reduced by factors such as memory loss and errors in recall. The prospective study with follow up at different stages of the pandemic can help us better understand the sleep mental health response and multi-dimensional factors. Second, online survey is a useful tool for evaluating how the general public understands and perceives a fast-moving infectious disease outbreak, however the possibility of selection bias such as occupation and age should be considered. In this study, the medical staff participants constituted a relatively high proportion, causing a deviation towards a higher degree in education. Further studies with multiple recruiting sources including traditional paper questionnaires may broaden subject participation. 5. Conclusion",1.0,flu,True
