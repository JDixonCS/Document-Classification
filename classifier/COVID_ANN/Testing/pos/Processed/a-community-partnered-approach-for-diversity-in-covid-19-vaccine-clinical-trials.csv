10,"Abstract Introduction: Communities of color have faced disproportionate morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, coupled with historical underrepresentation in US clinical trials, creating challenges for equitable participation in developing and testing a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: To increase diversity, including racial and ethnic representation, in local Los Angeles County NIH-sponsored Phase 3 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials, we used deliberative community engagement approaches to form a Community Consultant Panel (CCP) that partnered with trial research teams. Thirteen members were recruited, including expertise from essential workers, community-based and faith-based organizations, or leaders from racial and ethnic minority communities. Results: Working closely with local investigators for the vaccine studies, the CCP provided critical insight on best practices for community trust-building, clinical trial participation, and reliable information dissemination regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Modifying recruitment, outreach, and trial protocols led to majority-minority participants (55% - 78%) in each of the three vaccine clinical trials. CCP's input led to cultural tailoring of recruitment materials, changes in recruitment messaging, and supportive services to improve trial accessibility and acceptability (transportation, protocols for cultural competency, and support linkages to care in case of an adverse event). Barriers to clinical trial participation unable to be resolved included childcare, requests for after-hours appointment availability, and mobile locations for trial visits. Conclusion: Using deliberative community engagement can provide critical and timely insight into the community-centered barriers to COVID-19 vaccine trial participation, including addressing social determinants of health, trust, clinical trial literacy, structural barriers, and identifying trusted messenger and reliable sources of information.",1.0,COVID-19,True

14,"reduction of disproportionate pandemic-related morbidity and mortality in racial and ethnic minority communities that have seen declines in life expectancy due to COVID-19.1-4 Early in the pandemic, there were low racial and ethnic minority participation rates in phase I and II clinical trials.5 Historical underrepresentation of minorities in clinical trials,6,7 including vaccine trials,8,9 presented a critical challenge to the successful development, testing, and use of a safe and efficacious vaccine by those who need it most. Underrepresentation of participants from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds may have implications for the generalizability of clinical trial results, given the efficacy and safety of medical treatments may differ by race or ethnicity.10 Enhanced representation of diverse groups in vaccine trials may also enhance subsequent vaccine uptake,5 increase equitable access to other timely or novel treatments, and contribute to our understanding of health disparities. Thus, early in the inception of COVID-19 vaccine trials, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) identified increasing accessibility to underrepresented populations as a priority and vital to providing equitable protection from COVID-19.",1.0,pandemic,True
15,"To address enrollment gaps in COVID-19 clinical trials, we collaborated with NIHsponsored Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial teams in Los Angeles County to convene a Community Consultant Panel (CCP), an advisory group designed to provide community feedback and recommendations to improve the recruitment and retention of minority participants. The goals of the CCP were to help increase participant diversity and representation--by race/ethnicity, essential worker occupation, and geography by recruiting CCP members from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups from communities with high rates of infection, morbidity, and mortality--in local COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and provide access to accurate information about clinical trials to communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Assuring diversity amongst trial participants was particularly relevant as California has the highest number of COVID-19 cases nationwide, with 32% percent of cases in Los Angeles County, one of the country's most populated and racially diverse counties.11 We describe our approach to forming the CCP, how recruitment strategies were modified, and enrollment outcomes across three local vaccine trials.

The CCP had several roles: to consult with academic clinical trial researchers, health professionals, and other Los Angeles-based community leaders, to identify barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial participation across diverse communities in Los Angeles County, and to provide recommendations for enhancing clinical trial participation in diverse communities. Deliberative Community Engagement",1.0,Community,True
19,"We used a Deliberative Community Engagement (DCE) approach to understand and enhance clinical trial recruitment and implementation and better understand and address the pervasive lack of diverse representation in clinical trials. DCE has been used to examine and obtain community input on a variety of complex health and social issues.12-15 The process allows participants to consider relevant information from multiple points of view and involves: recruiting a sample of relevant stakeholders (regarded as experts in how the topic at hand concerns or affects the population at risk) to serve as deliberates; engage in educational activities to ensure stakeholders have a working knowledge of the technical issues at hand, as well as clinical, social, and other trade-offs; facilitate discussion so participants can clarify their values and understand others' perspectives; and develop and discuss specific recommendations.12 CCP Member Recruitment",1.0,Community,True

23,"Because of the immediate need to implement trial protocols and design equitable engagement plans, CCP met weekly over zoom with UCLA researchers for eight weeks (90 min per meeting) in Summer 2020 to identify barriers to trial participation. Members were compensated for their time commensurate with the expected time commitment, both during and outside the scheduled meetings, and were offered a tablet with free internet access if needed for CCP participation. Before the first meeting, each participant received a clinical trial briefing booklet with information on COVID-19, clinical trial stages and processes, the importance of diverse participation in research, and the protection of human subjects. These and other materials were also made available to participants on a website, which was regularly updated with evolving information.",1.0,trial,True
24,"Weekly CCP meetings aimed to promote bidirectional exchange on trial processes, COVID-19, vaccines, and other topics determined by the CCP. The academic team (principal site investigators, clinical trial staff, and CERP staff) developed and shared brief educational presentations about COVID, vaccine development, regulatory approval, emergency authorization processes, and vaccine risk, benefits, and safety. Discussions were framed around community concerns related to trial participation, strategies for clear and culturally appropriate recruitment messaging, and trial participation barriers of high-risk groups. Discussions were driven by new information about the virus, vaccines, trials, and other topics determined by the CCP. Supplemental Table 1 provides a brief outline of the educational objectives of each session and the discussion topics covered during the CCP meeting. For some of the sessions, representatives from a marketing and communications firm hired by two of the local clinical trials participated and had an opportunity to interact directly with community members on language and design of outreach materials, approach, and potential outlets for messaging.

The second group of suggestions related to the importance of inclusive community-engaged approaches to promote more effective outreach and recruitment, developing culturally tailored approaches for engagement, and recruitment communications that promote inclusion, including engagement strategies for responding to questions, concerns, misinformation, and disinformation prevalent in the community. Third, the CCP strongly endorsed enhancing trial accessibility and acceptability related to the social determinants of health, including improving local practices that promote a welcoming environment and address the needs of low-income individuals with competing financial and social demands and study protocols. They specifically recommended strategies to reduce barriers to participation, such as providing transportation services, language translation services for visits and all study documents, offering child care services, and addressing concerns about access to medical visits for vaccine-related side-effects for those who lack health care coverage. CCP members specifically endorsed the importance of creating a welcoming study environment through intentional 'customer service' efforts to improve trust, acceptability, and retention of underrepresented populations in research. The panel recommended that participants receive access to food and refreshments, accommodations for additional instruction, and a clear plan for visits and follow-up to address health literacy, language translation services, and recognition for their participation and time. Lastly, participants recommended clinical trial sites be located directly in the community to improve accessibility and reduce social burden.",1.0,community,True
34,"Discussions allowed for the iterative development of locally tailored strategies to modify engagement practices related to outreach, recruitment, and retention. During these discussions, the panelists identified individuals, agencies, organizations, media outlets, and community members they viewed as trusted messengers, provided introductions to key stakeholders in the community, and helped craft messages for trial information and dissemination. To enhance transparency, the team shared information on NIH and industry funding for the trials in Los Angeles County and links to websites with that information. Structured discussions were held on trial protocols for each vaccine (""clinical trial basics""), participant expectations related to the timing of procedures, vaccine types, risks such as side effects and the potential for lack of efficacy, as well as the potential benefits of participation, including compensation, early access to promising vaccines, and medical screenings.",1.0,community,True

37,"Tailoring of the recruitment messaging incorporated readability, inclusive language, diversity in images of participants represented, and updating frequently asked questions in response to trial and vaccine development progress, changes in the pandemic, and CDC and local public health guidance. For example, initial drafts of clinical trial recruitment materials listed eligibility criteria indicating the need for ""documentation"" of a negative COVID-19 test. The CCP noted the word ""documentation"" was a potential trigger for deterring undocumented persons or families with mixed documentation status from participation due to the burden of proof and misconceptions participation in public benefits (access to free COVID-19 test) can interfere with future immigration eligibility, also known as fear of public charge.17,18 Ensuring undocumented populations felt safe in clinical trial enrollment was particularly important to the CCP, considering it was unknown at that time if COVID-19 vaccines would only be covered by health insurance.",1.0,trial,True
38,"To improve accessibility and acceptability for trial participation, participants suggested ways to reduce participation barriers related to social determinants of health and suggested improving trial retention through a genuine focus on the participant. Social barriers were mitigated by providing transportation for participants (both for routine visits and ""sick day visits,"" e.g., visits to the clinical trial site to address symptoms that might represent infection or side effects related to the vaccine), Spanish translation services, and referrals to resources for those who were uninsured or underinsured. Although most of the participating clinical trial sites had a strong record of collaboration with diverse communities, the extensive 'customer service' recommendations from the CCP were important reminders of the need to build rapport with participants to enhance retention. Recommendations included a welcoming environment for participants, many of whom had never participated in a clinical trial yet were now doing so in the context of COVID-19 distancing requirements and other restrictions, increased personal and community stressors, and competing clinical and social demands brought about by the pandemic. Specific recommendations included thanking participants for their time, providing clear",1.0,trial,True

41,"The local clinical trials could not address some CCP recommendations. For example, participants strongly endorsed the need for more clinical trial locations in minority communities through mobile trial sites and partnerships with minority services institutions. However, most vaccine trial sites were identified based on prior NIH accreditation, and available mobile vans could not process the clinical trial samples. Other suggestions, such as a need for after-hours availability, including weekends and weeknights, and on-site child care, were not feasible due to union, staffing, or resource limitations. Finally, some panelists' inadequate staff diversity at some sites and lack of fluency in languages other than English and Spanish were major concerns, particularly for representatives of Asian and Pacific Islander communities. Panelists and clinical research teams endorsed the need for lay health workers from these communities who could facilitate participation in the participant's preferred language, study materials (including consent forms and informational materials), and staff and/or translators who could address these participants' needs in real-time.

The rapid implementation timeline also required significant funding to support the DCE approach, staff trained in community engagement, and adequate compensation for CCP participants, given the demands on their time and the need for a quick turnaround for feedback. This study took place in a racially and ethnically diverse urban setting with access to several recruitment sites, so it may not generalize to other locations. Finally, many CCP members had prior experience with research and were highly educated. The perspectives of the members of the CCP may not represent the community at large or those with less favorable views of research; however, we intentionally recruited community leaders with experience working with high-risk communities and racially and ethnically diverse community members to inform our approach.

To promote the generalizability of clinical trial outcomes and address the needs of populations at the highest risk for health inequities, policies are needed to enhance representation in the biomedical workforce, promote collaborations with trusted community members and organizations, and develop and monitor metrics for diversity in clinical trials beyond race/ethnicity, age, and gender (i.e., socioeconomic status, insurance status, sexual identity and orientation, languages spoken, language preferences). Such policies will build confidence, engage community stakeholders early in the clinical trial process, and overcome social disparities that contribute to health inequities.
