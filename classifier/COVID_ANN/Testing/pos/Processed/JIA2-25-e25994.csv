6,"Introduction: Men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who inject drugs (PWID) are disproportionately impacted by the HIV epidemic in Canada. Having the second-highest provincial diagnosis rate, an improved understanding of the epidemic among these populations in Québec could aid ongoing elimination efforts. We estimated HIV incidence and other epidemic indicators among MSM and PWID in Montréal and across Québec using a back-calculation model synthesizing surveillance data. Methods: We developed a deterministic, compartmental mathematical model stratified by age, HIV status and disease progression, and clinical care stages. Using AIDS and HIV diagnoses data, including self-reported time since the last negative test and laboratory results of CD4 cell count at diagnosis, we estimated HIV incidence in each population over 1975-2020 by modelling a cubic M-spline. The prevalence, undiagnosed fraction, fraction diagnosed that started antiretroviral treatment (ART) and median time to diagnosis were also estimated. Since the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted testing, we excluded 2020 data and explored this in sensitivity analyses. Results: HIV incidence in all populations peaked early in the epidemic. In 2020, an estimated 97 (95% CrI: 33-227) and 266 (95% CrI: 103-508) HIV acquisitions occurred among MSM in Montréal and Québec, respectively. Among PWID, we estimated 2 (95% CrI: 0-14) and 6 (95% CrI: 1-26) HIV acquisitions in those same regions. With 2020 data, unless testing rates were reduced by 50%, these estimates decreased, except among Québec PWID, whose increased. Among all, the median time to diagnosis shortened to <2 years before 2020 and the undiagnosed fraction decreased to <10%. This fraction was higher in younger MSM, with 22% of 15-24 year-olds living with HIV in Montréal (95% CrI: 9-39%) and 31% in Québec (95% CrI: 17-48%) undiagnosed by 2020 year-end. Finally, ART access neared 100% in all diagnosed populations. Conclusions: HIV incidence has drastically decreased in MSM and PWID across Québec, alongside significant improvements in diagnosis and treatment coverage--and the 2013 introduction of pre-exposure prophylaxis. Despite this, HIV transmission continued. Effective efforts to halt this transmission and rapidly diagnose people who acquired HIV, especially among younger MSM, are needed to achieve elimination. Further, as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV transmission are understood, increased efforts may be needed to overcome these.",1.0,epidemic,True

17,"In 2016, Canada endorsed the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) efforts to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic as a public health threat [6]. Cities, where key populations often reside, play a crucial role in HIV epidemics [7]. Québec's epidemic epicentre lies in Montréal where 61% of new 2019 diagnoses occurred [5]. In 2017, Montréal became the first UNAIDS Fast-Track City in Canada, committing to HIV elimination by 2030 [8,9]. Interim, 2020 targets aimed for zero new HIV acquisitions, a strengthened treatment and care cascade (reaching 95% diagnosis coverage, 95% of those diagnosed on treatment, and, of those, 95% virally suppressed by 2025), zero discrimination and zero stigma [10]. Measuring the target of zero new HIV acquisitions is difficult as it cannot be directly observed.

Analyses discerning new acquisitions from diagnoses while accounting for testing trends are needed.",1.0,epidemic,True
18,"Timely estimates of new HIV acquisitions are necessary to monitor progress towards elimination and identify unmet prevention needs. Doing so requires modelling tools synthesizing surveillance data, allowing the back-calculation of HIV incidence using information, such as CD4 cell count at diagnosis and HIV testing history [11]. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) estimates HIV incidence using a statistical back-calculation method based on HIV and AIDS diagnoses and HIV/AIDS-related deaths [12]. Overall national and provincial estimates, and those stratified by exposure category (e.g. MSM and PWID), are typically produced and provided to provincial public health authorities. Overall Québec estimates have been reported up to 2018 [13]. However, the last publicly reported exposure category estimates for Québec are from 2011 [14].

143,"Our results also point to rapid and robust improvements in the treatment and care cascade. The fraction of undiagnosed PLHIV is estimated at 4.3% (95% CrI: 2.3-7.2%) among Montréal's MSM, a finding supported by the Engage cohort [36,37], and 1.6% (95% CrI: 0.4-7.1%) among PWID. Therefore, Montréal has already reached the 2025 goal of 95% diagnosed among these populations. However, setbacks could have occurred since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Provincially, slightly higher proportions were unaware of their status: 7.9% of MSM (95% CrI: 4.6-12.4%) and 2.8% of PWID (95% CrI: 1.0-8.0%). Previous studies suggested PLHIV residing outside of urban areas could face additional barriers in accessing healthcare, including stigma, further distance to providers coupled with inadequate transportation and local providers being less experienced with HIV and/or key populations [38,39]. There were also proportionally more young MSM unaware of their status, highlighting their unmet prevention needs. Lower diagnosis coverage among younger PLHIV also reflects HIV's transmission dynamics: young people have a higher incidence and smaller cumulative testing exposure [33,40]. Concomitant with diagnosis coverage improvements, we estimated shortened diagnostic delays. Still, further reductions could impact onward HIV transmission if linkage to care is prompt.",1.0,COVID-19,True
144,"Finally, almost 100% of diagnosed PLHIV have taken ART-- in line with empirical estimates from a Montréal clinical cohort [41] and Engage [36], suggesting high proportions of diagnosed PLHIV are being linked to care. While this does not speak to current use or levels of viral suppression, these",1.0,clinical,True
145,"studies did estimate >95% of those diagnosed were on ART and, of those, >88% were virally suppressed [36,41]. Although we do not model the impact of ART on transmission directly, its successful scale-up likely played a part in the incidence declines over the last decade. Moreover, preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was introduced for MSM in 2013 and could have accelerated incidence reductions, especially amidst increased usage in recent years [42,43], where coverage (i.e. those currently on PrEP) rose from 5% to 10% between 2017 and 2018 in Montréal [43].",1.0,transmission,True
146,"Given the richness and granularity of Québec's HIV surveillance data, we tailored our model to its intricacies. PHAC's back-calculation method is general to accommodate the different provincial data streams. We explicitly describe the clinical course of HIV, allow testing rates per disease stage and calibrate to multiple sources of recency information, all of which could more accurately estimate incidence. Moreover, modelling ART captures reduced mortality and improves our prevalence estimation. The trends in incidence did follow those modelled by PHAC until 2011 among MSM and PWID in Canada [14]. Their 2011 Québec-specific estimates suggested 425 (290-560) and 9690 (7880-11,500) MSM acquired and were living with HIV that year, respectively [14]. Among PWID, they estimated that there were 60 (40-80) HIV acquisitions and 3000 (2400-3600) PLHIV [14]. In that same year, we projected fewer HIV acquisitions (297, 95% CrI: 215-370 in MSM and 10, 95% CrI: 6-17 in PWID) and a smaller population of PLHIV (6928, 95% CrI: 5469- 8334 MSM and 1046, 95% CrI: 689-1544 PWID).

150,"This study has several limitations. First, the paucity of data informing the active PWID population sizes, and the potential underrepresentation of active PWID in the available estimates, necessitated additional assumptions in this regard. Therefore, we did not provide HIV incidence rates for PWID and focused on HIV acquisitions. Moreover, we lacked appropriate PWID cross-validation data as local studies [44,45] have focused solely on individuals actively injecting, whereas we modelled all people who ever injected drugs. Further, despite modelling reporting delays, we did not have strong estimates to inform them. However, we believe most transmissions occurring and diagnosed in Québec have a high probability of being reported without delay, and our calibrated reporting fractions reflect this (approximately 70-80% across populations). Concerning demography, we do not capture the migration of PLHIV. Not unlike other models, this could affect the prevalence and undiagnosed fraction, the extent to which depends on the level and direction of the net migration of PLHIV in the MSM and PWID populations. In our setting, we expect net migration to be small and our estimates to be robust. Our cross-validation to the Engage study's prevalence is also reassuring. Finally, HIV testing could have fluctuated in recent years. Potential increases alongside PrEP scale-up, for example, could identify more undiagnosed PLHIV through consultations, leading our model to overestimate incidence [46]. Despite this, the number of diagnoses remained relatively stable. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted testing in 2020, and the extent to which is not yet known [47]. Thus, we explored this in sensitivity analyses.",1.0,transmission,True

152,"The UNAIDS Fast-Track City goals are ambitious. Meeting and maintaining targets of zero new HIV acquisitions, 95% diagnosis coverage, 95% treatment coverage and 95% viral suppression requires an actionable response and epidemic monitoring. Leveraging detailed surveillance data complemented by other sources, we provided up-to-date estimates of important epidemic metrics among key populations in Montréal and across Québec. This work demonstrates how such back-calculation mathematical models can be applied in a Canadian context to estimate incidence, compared to only monitoring diagnoses, and other jurisdictions with similar data could do the same. Identifying effective policies to progress towards and sustain elimination is crucial, especially in light of the possible setbacks from the decline in prevention service access and use during the COVID-19 pandemic [47]. Future work exploring the population-level impact of interventions that could be scaled-up, such as PrEP, could inform these.",1.0,epidemic,True
