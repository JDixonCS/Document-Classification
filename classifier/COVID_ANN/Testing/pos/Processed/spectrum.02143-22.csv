6,"ABSTRACT The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) has posed an enormous burden on the global public health system and has had disastrous socioeconomic consequences. Currently, single sampling tests, 20-in-1 pooling tests, nucleic acid point-of-care tests (POCTs), and rapid antigen tests are implemented in different scenarios to detect SARS-CoV-2, but a comprehensive evaluation of them is scarce and remains to be explored. In this study, 3 SARS-CoV-2 inactivated cell culture supernatants were used to evaluate the analytical performance of these strategies. Additionally, 5 recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) proteins were also used for rapid antigen tests. For the wild-type (WT), Delta, and Omicron strains, the lowest inactivated virus concentrations to achieve 100% detection rates of single sampling tests ranged between 1.28 Â 102 to 1.02 Â 103, 1.28 Â 102 to 4.10 Â 103, and 1.28 Â 102 to 2.05 Â 103 copies/mL. The 20in-1 pooling tests ranged between 1.30 Â 102 to 1.04 Â 103, 5.19 Â 102 to 2.07 Â 103, and 2.59 Â 102 to 1.04 Â 103 copies/mL. The nucleic acid POCTs were all 1.42 Â 103 copies/mL. The rapid antigen tests ranged between 2.84 Â 105 to 7.14 Â 106, 8.68 Â 104 to 7.14 Â 106, and 1.12 Â 105 to 3.57 Â 106 copies/mL. For the WT, Delta AY.2, Delta AY.1/ AY.3, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2 recombinant N proteins, the lowest concentrations to achieve 100% detection rates of rapid antigen tests ranged between 3.47 to 142.86, 1.74 to 142.86, 3.47 to 142.86, 3.47 to 142.86, and 5.68-142.86 ng/mL, respectively. This study provided helpful insights into the scientific deployment of tests and recommended the fullscale consideration of the testing purpose, resource availability, cost performance, result rapidity, and accuracy to facilitate a profound pathway toward the long-term surveillance of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).",1.0,pandemic,True
7,"IMPORTANCE In the study, we reported an evaluation of 4 detection strategies implemented in different scenarios for SARS-CoV-2 detection: single sampling tests, 20-in-1 pooling tests, nucleic acid point-of-care tests, and rapid antigen tests. 3 SARSCoV-2-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatants and 5 recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins were used for evaluation. In this analysis, we found that for the WT, Delta, and Omicron supernatants, the lowest concentrations to achieve 100% detection rates of single sampling tests ranged between 1.28 Â 102 to 1.02 Â 103, 1.28 Â 102 to 4.10 Â 103, and 1.28 Â 102 to 2.05 Â 103 copies/mL.

As of August 26, 2022, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases reported worldwide has exceeded 596 million, and the number of deaths has exceeded 6 million (2). A total of 242,307 confirmed cases and 5,226 deaths have been reported in mainland China (3).",1.0,pandemic,True
14,"Naturally occurring mutations can be selected continuously during virus transmission, which is a dominating obstacle to the prevention and control of COVID-19. Among the variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VOI) designated by the World Health Organization (WHO), based on the transmissibility, pathogenicity, and threat to public health (4), the Delta and Omicron variants were first reported in Guangdong on May 18, 2021 (5), and in Tianjin on December 13, 2021 (6), respectively. The P618R mutation of the Delta variant was found to be closely associated with enhanced viral fusogenicity and pathogenicity (7, 8). The Omicron variant harbors a large number of mutations that have been proven to be involved in higher binding affinity with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (9), enhanced pathogenicity and transmissibility (10), and an increased ability of immune evasion (11). In order to confirm infected cases, quarantine populations at risk, and interrupt the chain of transmission, scientific and appropriate detection methods and strategies applicable to specific scenarios should be employed (12).",1.0,transmission,True
15,"Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction S(rRT-PCR) is based on the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and is regarded as the most sensitive and specific method for confirming clinical diagnoses (13). Driven by the throughput limitations of single sampling tests and the urgent demand for improving both the daily testing capacity and the overall testing efficiency in low-risk regions, 5-in-1, 10-in-1, and 20-in-1 sample pooling strategies are proposed and executed for large-scale population screening (14). However, due to the fact that rRT-PCR requires sophisticated equipment, professional personnel, and has a long turnaround time (15), the nucleic acid point-of-care test (POCT) was developed to confer the advantages of high sensitivity, short turnaround time, and independence of laboratory settings (16). Considering the necessity of conducting targeted screening in locations with high risks of transmission, the Chinese government advocates employing rapid antigen tests that usually detect viral nucleoproteins as complementary health tools. As of August 29, 2022, 32 rapid antigen tests have been approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for emergency use and are being used in various settings to support rRT-PCR (17).",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
16,"Regarding the detection methods mentioned above, analytical sensitivity is a fundamental parameter that can facilitate decisions for application and determine their practical use in various scenarios. The performance of the NMPA-approved rRT-PCR assays has been comprehensively analyzed and demonstrated previously; however, there are restricted data on the performance characteristics of these newly approved rapid antigen tests. Additionally, the evaluation of single sampling tests, 20-in-1 pooling tests, nucleic acid POCTs, and rapid antigen tests implemented in different scenarios is scarce and remains to be explored. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the analytical sensitivities of these four detection strategies applied in different settings and to provide sufficient researchbased evidence for the scientific refinement of the deployment of these tests.",0.0,,False

The Omicron variant is estimated to have an R0 value of up to 10 and a doubling time of every 2 to 3 days (18), which makes it reasonable to supersede Delta as the dominant variant by December of 2021. With the proportion of asymptomatic infections calculated to be as high as 80 to 90%, as well as the rapid occult transmissibility (19), the Omicron variant has swept numerous cities with an unprecedented speed, especially in Shanghai, where the number of daily confirmed infected cases has roared up to 20,000 for days on end. Faced with the grim situation of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the Omicron variant, which has a higher pathogenicity and spreads more rapidly, frequent testing enables the early detection of infections, which is critical in providing a prompt diagnosis for patient management and in conducting epidemiological studies to promote public health measures (20-22). Several studies (23, 24) have revealed that nearly one-fifth of all virus transmission was recognized to be associated with asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals, and the efficacy of outbreak control depends mostly on the frequency of testing, rather than on test sensitivity, through epidemiological modeling. Therefore, pandemic prevention and control strategies are required to cut off the transmission chains within communities through the scale-up of diagnostic testing, contact tracing, and quarantining (25).",1.0,asymptomatic,True

234,"role in the identification of COVID-19 positive cases. In the quest for improving overall detection efficiency with an acceptable slight loss of analytical sensitivity, the pooling strategies are proposed, and these can be implemented to expedite the early discovery of community transmission, promote timely infection control measures of SARS-CoV-2, and alleviate the workload of medical staff. By mixing nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and testing them as a single pool, the detection kits and turnaround times are largely economized. Catherine et al. (27) showed that a 9/10-in-1 pooling strategy could detect positive samples correctly at a population prevalence rate of 0.07%. Idan et al. (28) found that the false-negative rate of a 32-in-1 pooling strategy can be as low as 10%. Stefan et al. (14) proposed a 30-in-1 pooling strategy for increasing test efficiency on the premise of ensuring the correct detection of positive samples. However, the primary bottleneck of pooled testing is the reduced concentration of viral genetic material below the limit of detection for certain tests due to sample dilution, which thereby leads to decreased diagnostic sensitivity and false-negative results (29). When using the 5 rRT-PCR kits to detect the same strain, the range of the lowest inactivated virus concentration to achieve 100% detection via 20-in-1 pooling tests was substantially the same as that of the single sampling tests. Overall, when detecting the diluted samples above the claimed LODs, the 20-in-1 pooling tests showed comparable analytical sensitivities to those of the single sampling tests. Studies (30) have found that the viral load at the early onset was beyond 1Â106 copies/mL, which can be detected by both single sampling tests and 20-in-1 pooling tests. Therefore, the 20-in-1 pooling tests enable mass nucleic acid testing with only 5% of the original testing workload, greatly improving the daily testing efficiency, which is the first consideration in the screening of asymptomatic infected cases in low-risk regions (31). Nevertheless, regarding the possibility of the increasing need to retest singly, the optimal pool size, while ensuring the expected analytical sensitivity and time efficiency, requires the deliberation of the prevalence rates in the community, the infection situations, the aim of the testing, and the available resources. In addition, due to the Omicron variant's capability of aerosol transmission (32), prevention measures, including mask use, well-zoned sampling sites, and sufficiently dispersed staff density should be strictly implemented during the organization of sample collection.",1.0,COVID-19,True
235,"The nucleic acid point-of-care test has the advantage of not relying on laboratory equipment and professional personnel to detect viral nucleic acid, but its extensive deployment in domestic regions is impeded by the development and manufacturing of technology platforms. Furthermore, the sensitivity level of self-administered nucleic acid POCT for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA also varies, depending on the methods and application settings. Unexpectedly, the Ustar nucleic acid POCT, which combines cross-priming amplification (CPA) and nucleic acid lateral flow technologies, can detect samples at concentrations as low as 1.42 Â 103 copies/mL, showing excellent performance in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the study. With a short turnaround time, portable procedures (33), and an analytical sensitivity comparable to that of the gold standard rRT-PCR, nucleic acid POCT is a promising diagnostic agent for aiding in the expansion of testing (34) and can be used as confirmatory testing where laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification testing is not available (35). However, due to the scarcity of portable nucleic acid POCT assays validated in China, only one CE-IVD marked kit was included in the study. More evidence-based experimental data remains to be explored in order to obtain a comprehensive view of the performance of this method in detecting SARS-CoV-2.",1.0,equipment,True
236,"Rapid antigen tests are developing rapidly and are becoming available from various manufacturers in response to the Omicron variant wreaking havoc in many regions of China. With the advantages of being free of laboratory settings, offering a shorter time to result, and being mass and cost-effective to manufacture, they can act as a potential alternative method if molecular tests are not available (36). Our study revealed that the detection performance of different rapid antigen kits varied greatly, and the lowest concentrations that achieved a 100% rate of detection success ranged from 104 to 106 copies/mL for inactivated cell culture supernatants and from 1 to 150 ng/mL for recombinant N proteins, which was essentially consistent with the findings reported in",1.0,,True

241,"previously published articles (35, 37). The antibody labeling method of rapid antigen tests would affect their analytical performance, and the fluorescence microsphere was observed to enhance the sensitivity of the analytical signal by 10 to 100-fold compared to that of the latex microsphere and colloidal gold (38). Besides, the lowest concentrations of the 50 mL original sample that displayed 100% detection by rapid antigen tests (105 to 107 copies/mL) were about 100 times as high as those of the single sampling test (103 to 105 copies/mL). On account of the viral load changing rapidly during the acute phase of infection, rapid antigen tests can only be applied validly in the first week of symptoms (39). Studies (40-42) have also found that there is little chance of transmitting the virus for patients with a viral load of less than 1 Â 106 copies/mL at the end of the first week of symptoms, meaning that rapid antigen tests can be used as tools by which to estimate infectivity and that a negative antigen result is an indication of infectivity resolution. On the whole, although they are not as sensitive and specific as molecular tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, rapid antigen tests should be considered as rapid diagnostic tools that require minimal training and offer cost-effective and time-saving detection processes for the instantaneous assessment of infectivity rather than for the exclusion of infection, mass screening in high-risk areas, and the detection of symptomatic cases meeting the COVID-19 case definition (43). However, a randomized clinical trial (44) found that a large proportion of the population misinterpreted the negative results of at-home self-tests or ignored the CDC's recommendations to self-isolate, creating redundant disruptions and unexpected risks. Consequently, user compliance and the interpretability of the results should be improved to maximize the benefits of at-home self-test kits.",1.0,flu,True
242,"The indispensable factors for a correct diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 include the attributes of the detection method itself, the sampling time after the onset of symptoms, the quality of the specimen, the proficiency of the test, and the interpretation of the result. Also, the continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 affects the accuracy and reliability of detection results to a certain extent. Once the mutations of the virus are located at the primer/probe-targeted regions, the effectiveness of molecular assays might be influenced to some degree. In this study, in contrast to the WT strain, impaired analytical sensitivity was found in the Delta variant using Kit N04, both for the single sampling tests (19/27 versus 11/27, P ,"" 0.028) and for the 20-in-1 pooling tests (16/27 versus 7/ 27, P "","" 0.013), whereas the Omicron variant had no significant effect on the 5 rRT-PCR kits and the POCT kit, which is in concordance with the findings of a prior study (45). However, the 19 rapid antigen tests showed an insignificant difference in analytical sensitivity for the 3 inactivated cell culture supernatants and the 5 recombinant N proteins, which might be attributable to the fact that nearly all of the rapid antigen tests target the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, which has less of a probability to mutate (12). Hence, to ensure the validity of the different detection strategies under the background of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity, it is essential to consolidate genomic surveillance and track the potential effects of mutations on detection performance.""",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

In a specific scenario, the optimal strategy should be adopted in consideration of the testing purpose, resource availability, cost performance, and result rapidity on the premise of test accuracy to thereby improve the overall detection efficiency, facilitate the discovery of early community transmission, and enable timely and long-term infection control measures under the conditions of limited detection capacity and overburdened laboratory infrastructure.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

To evaluate the analytical sensitivity in real-world sampling situations, a total of 1 and 20 oropharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2-negative healthy volunteers were placed into a single sampling tube containing 3 mL of a sample preservation solution and a 50 mL centrifuge tube containing 12 mL of a sample preservation solution, respectively. Each sample was prepared 27 times. After full oscillation and blending, serial 2-fold dilutions of the WT, Delta, and Omicron cell culture supernatants were performed (5 Â 105, 2.5 Â 105, 1.25 Â 105, 6.25 Â 104, 3.12 Â 104, 1.56 Â 104, 7.81 Â 103, 3.91 Â 103, and 1.95 Â 103 copies/mL), and 50 mL of them were added to each sample, respectively.

475,"Nucleic acid POCTs are portable, easy-to-operate, and isothermal amplification-based devices that are mainly characterized by their relative sensitivity, simple operation, short turnaround time, and independence of laboratory settings (33). The EasyNAT COVID-19 RNA Test from Ustar Biotechnologies Ltd. carries out CPA reactions through specific primers, probes, and DNA polymerase with high strand displacement activity to qualitatively detect the ORF1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2 with a claimed LOD of 3 Â 103 copies/mL (46). Self-collected nasopharyngeal swabs are immersed in the lysis buffer, one drop of which is added to a module preloaded with nucleic acid amplification reagents. After 55 min of reaction, the results can be available in the corresponding lateral flow strips. To identify the analytical sensitivity of the handheld portable POCT product (coded as Kit P01), 50 mL of the above supernatants were introduced into the lysis buffer provided with the kit in triplicate, which resulted in a predilution effect of 1:11. The subsequent procedures and interpretation of results were carried out as per the instructions.",1.0,COVID-19,True
476,"Rapid antigen tests. The main principle behind rapid antigen testing is the use of lateral flow immunoassays designed with the fluorescence microsphere, latex microsphere, or colloidal gold labeled SARSCoV-2 protein antibody to form an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex. Within 15 min, the test results can be interpreted with simple instruments when using the fluorescence method or with the naked eye when using the latex and colloidal gold methods. We included 19 rapid antigen tests approved by the NMPA in our study, including two fluorescence immunochromatography methods (Kit A01, BGI Biotech Co., Ltd. and Kit A02, Beijing Savant Biotechnology Co., Ltd.), five latex methods (Kit A03, Beijing Jinwofu Bioengineering Technology Co., Ltd.; Kit A04, Hangzhou ACON Biotech Co., Ltd.; Kit A05, Hangzhou AllTest Biotech Co.

The recommended volume of sample extraction solution varied from 280 mL to 600 mL for the different kits, resulting in different predilution ratios, which ranged from 1:6.6 to 1:13.

The predilution ratios varied according to the volumes of sample preservation solution (3 mL for the single sampling tests and 12 mL for the 20-in-1 pooling tests) or extraction solution (point-of-care test and rapid antigen tests), to which 50 mL samples of known concentrations were added (Table 2; Supplemental Material File 2).",0.0,,False
