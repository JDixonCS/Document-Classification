In the period between first confirmed cases and the introduction of widespread community testing, ambulance records of suspected severe illness from COVID-19 could be used to identify vulnerable communities and regions and rapidly appraise factors that may explain VSID. We analyse the spatial distribution of more than 10,000 suspected severe COVID-19 cases using records of provisional diagnoses made by trained paramedics attending medical emergencies. We identify 13 clusters of severe illness likely related to COVID-19 occurring in the East Midlands of the UK and present an in-depth analysis of those clusters, including urban and rural dynamics, the physical characteristics of landscapes, and socio-economic conditions. Our findings suggest that the dynamics of VSID vary depending on wider geographic location. Vulnerable communities and regions occur in more deprived urban centres as well as more affluent peri-urban and rural areas. This methodology could contribute to the development of a rapid national response to support vulnerable communities during emerging pandemics in real time to save lives.",1.0,pandemic,True

19,"There is growing recognition in the fields of epidemiology (Lofus, 2004; Miller et al., 2012; Norris et al., 2020; Viegi et al., 2006), and urban planning (Durand et al., 2010; Northridge et al., 2003; Seo et al., 2019; Spence et al., 2020) that complex interactions between physical landscapes and social factors drive vulnerability to contagion and severe illness, and thus, understanding these mechanisms should be the focus of disease prevention and management. Urban landscapes can simultaneously influence chronic conditions associated with susceptibility to severe pathogenic illness, such as obesity by facilitating access to fast food vendors (Daras et al., 2018), and increase exposure to disease through high density urbanism (Goryakin et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2016).",1.0,epidemiology,True
20,"On March 11th, 2020 the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic. Over the subsequent months, the research community has prioritised understanding contagion and transmission pathways (Park et al., 2020) as well as identifying and supporting vulnerable communities and regions (Daras et al., 2021; Khalatbari-Soltani et al., 2020; Patel et al., 2020). Vulnerable communities include those with pre-existing chronic conditions that are known to increase susceptibility to severe COVID-19 illness, such as diabetes (Peric & Stulnig, 2020) and overweight or obesity (Steinberg et al., 2020). Medical and public health research has led to widespread appreciation that the impact of the pandemic has, and continues to be, heterogenous; some communities and regions appear to be more vulnerable to severe illness than others (Marmot et al., 2020; Patel et al., 2020).",1.0,coronavirus,True
21,"One common observation is that urban and peri-urban areas tend to be sites of high rates of infection and mortality compared to more dispersed rural areas (Stier et al., 2020). High rates of infection suggest that urban landscapes are more exposed to transmission, and, given that many cases of infection are asymptomatic or involve very mild symptoms (Kim et al., 2020), high rates of mortality may indicate that communities within those landscapes are also more susceptible to severe illness (Guilmoto et al., 2020). Characteristics of urban landscapes that are typically associated with the transmission of infectious diseases include population and employment density (Hu et al., 2013), and housing crowdedness (Low et al., 2013; Neiderud et al., 2015). However, these relationships are rapidly changing and vary depending on region and specific location within urban areas. For example, `extended urbanisation' is shifting the dynamics of vulnerability; in some cases, communities on urban peripheries may be more vulnerable than those in denser urban centres with greater access to healthcare and social support (Connolly et al., 2021). Indeed, in the case of COVID-",1.0,area,True

23,"19, typical relationships between urban space and infectious disease do not consistently explain mortality, with high rates of severe cases occurring in less dense urban areas (Frank & Wali, 2021). Thus, there is a need to consider how urban landscapes influence the underlying susceptibility of communities to severe illness as well as exposure to infectious diseases.",1.0,infectious,True
24,"Surprisingly, of more than 40,000 papers using clinical diagnoses of COVID-19 published in 2020, fewer than 150 have considered the implications for urban planning, and those that do tend to focus on the impact that `lockdown' has had on urban landscapes, such as pollutant rates, rather than the impact of urban landscapes on health outcomes (Sharif & Khavarian-Garmsir, 2020). In this study, we consider the relationship between built environments, exposure to emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), and susceptibility to severe COVID-19 illness provisionally diagnosed by medically trained professionals. In this context, `severe illness' refers to patients presenting with severe symptoms that require the attendance of emergency medical services.",1.0,clinical,True
25,"Efforts to shield the most vulnerable communities and regions in society are more likely to be effective if they happen rapidly and in real-time (Kasda et al., 2020). Compared to other common disasters like flooding, obtaining geographically accurate data to evaluate the spatial dimensions of a pandemic, and to support vulnerable communities and regions, faces unique challenges. In the UK, the use of contact tracing and testing to identify community cases of COVID-19 commenced after the first confirmed case on January 31st, 2020. However, community testing ceased in early March as cases rose rapidly and the virus was classified as a category 3 pathogen, confining testing to level 3 laboratories. On April 2nd the UK government outlined a five-pillar strategy for expanding testing capacity including the introduction of community testing in early May, with laboratory capacity expanding rapidly over the next two months (The Health Foundation, 2020).",1.0,pandemic,True
26,"In the interim before laboratory capacity increased, identification of severe illness and vulnerable communities was based on individual's self-reporting of symptoms, such as via the NHS Test and Trace App, and the clinical judgement of medical professionals. Routine medical data collected within the first hour of emergency department (ED) admittance for severe illness has since been demonstrated to predict positive COVID-19 cases with a high degree of accuracy, including selfreported olfactory and taste dysfunction (OTD) (Wee, 2020; Patterson, 2020; Printza & Constantinidis, 2020) and blood oxygen levels (Soltan et al., 2021). These measures, guided by Public Health England's case definition symptom criteria (PHE, 2020) are also used by paramedic clinicians attending ambulance call outs for suspected COVID-19 cases.",1.0,clinical,True
27,"Our research involves analysing records of provisional diagnoses of COVID-19 made by trained paramedics attending medical emergencies in the East Midlands of the UK.

This is unsurprising given that testing in this early phase of the pandemic was largely confined to cases of severe illness, such as those patients conveyed by ambulances. Thus, ambulance records may be a reliable measure of severe COVID-19 related illness in real-time. To our knowledge, ambulance data have not previously been utilised to identify communities and regions that may be vulnerable to severe illness from COVID-19 or to investigate the social and environmental factors that may influence vulnerability.

29,"Ambulance records of provisional diagnosis hold several important advantages over hospital admittance records and laboratory records of confirmed cases for identifying vulnerable communities affected by severe illness. Hospitals and laboratories are required under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to aggregate patient information for reporting. Others have explored socio-economic predictors of aggregate confirmed cases in the UK at less granular scales (eg., Daras et al., 2021). However, without costly and time-consuming data linkage via NHS Digital, aggregated patient data does not allow for meaningful analysis of spatial patterns or characteristics of physical and social environments that explain geographical trends of severe illness. Ambulance data, including postcode region1, allows a more granular analysis of factors that predict severe illness from COVID-19 infection in real-time.",1.0,case,True
30,"Our study presents a novel methodology for identifying communities and regions that are vulnerable to severe illness during the early phase of a pandemic before laboratory testing is widespread. This involves considering both risk of exposure to a contagious disease as well as underlying susceptibility to severe illness. We identify unusual clusters of provisionally diagnosed severe COVID-19 cases in real-time using medical data collated by EMAS. Provisional diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 is determined by paramedics based on observed signs, such as patient acuity, self-reported symptoms, such as OTD, and objective medical measures, such as blood oxygen levels. Our analysis explores the characteristics of communities and regions within built environments where unusual clusters occur, including landscape features and socio-economic dynamics. In this context, `unusual clusters' refers to high numbers of cases occurring within spatial proximity that are unlikely to have occurred by chance. Taken together, these analyses offer a real-time approach for identifying and protecting vulnerable communities in the critical early stages between the first confirmed case of a new EID and widespread community testing, as well as for identifying the characteristics of those communities most affected by severe illness over the course of a pandemic.",1.0,pandemic,True

32,"Theories about individual health and wider environments emerged in the 1980s as a critical response to medical and epidemiological paradigms; traditional medical models conceptualise health in terms of the presence or absence of biological disease, and the outcome of exposures that occur entirely at the level of the individual (Barbour, 1997). More contemporary `social' perspectives suggest that health transcends the individual and recognize the important role that social networks (Smith & Christakis, 2008) and wider social environments, including deprivation, play in health outcomes (Marmot, 1998).",1.0,disease,True
33,"Efforts to consider interactions between individual or biological factors and social factors often draw on Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theories (Eriksson et al., 2018), including his original Ecological Social Model, as well as the more recent Process-Person-Context-Time model (Rosa & Tudge, 2013). These frameworks advanced the field of public health by introducing a way to conceptualise the multi-level social interactions that influence health and wellbeing. Bronfenbrenner's models divide the social world of an individual into four `systems'; the Microsystem, including the most immediate elements of the social world, such as family, the Mesosystem, including extended social networks, the Exosystem, including wider community services, and the Macrosystem including commonly shared cultural and social beliefs and values (Bronfenbrenner, 1979).",1.0,social,True

36,"While progressive, bioecological theories focus almost exclusively on the social world and social vulnerabilities and rarely consider landscape features that are also understood to influence health outcomes (Campbell & Wiesen, 2009; Cervero & Duncan, 2003; Williams, 2016). In contrast, in the field of urban planning, vulnerability is often conceptualised in relation to hazards and risks in the landscape, such as exposure to direct communicable disease, as well as more distal relationships, or `teleconnections' (Seto et al., 2012) between landscape features, like access to green space (De Vries et al., 2003; Markevych et al., 2017) and underlying health conditions, such as obesity (Daras et al., 2018). Importantly, exposure to a virus does not necessarily precipitate a medical emergency, rather, severe symptoms requiring emergency medical attention reflect the cumulative effect of exposure and underlying susceptibility. Thus, vulnerability is multifaceted, incorporating components of the physical landscape and components of the social world. While both bioecological and urban risk theories have advanced ways of thinking about health outcomes and pathways of vulnerability, a holistic approach is needed that considers the range of factors in built environments that precipitate severe illness and death from COVID-19.",1.0,social,True
37,"In the case of COVID-19, the relationship between severe illness and characteristics of the built environment involves both direct and indirect pathways. On the one hand, environments can influence the direct exposure of individuals to communicable disease. On the other hand, landscape features can indirectly affect the underlying susceptibility of communities to severe symptoms, compared to experiencing mild symptoms or presenting as asymptomatic, by supporting or preventing healthy lifestyles. Features of neighbourhoods that can influence health behaviours like exercise include access to green space for passive recreation such as walking, and facilities for active exercise, such as sports grounds or leisure centres (Hartig et al., 2020). Further distance from these healthy landscape features is associated with lower levels of activity and higher risk of cardiovascular disease (Shen & Lung, 2016) and obesity (Lachowycz & Jones, 2011). However, landscape features can also reflect the social characteristics of wider living environments; high crime rates co-occur with poor physical infrastructure like housing in deprived communities. Crime can deter access to nearby outdoor spaces (Gomez et al., 2004) while poor housing indicates lower incomes and a greater likelihood of underlying chronic health conditions (Krieger & Higgins, 2002).",1.0,case,True
38,"While deprivation broadly is associated with susceptibility to severe illness, the socio-economic characteristics of patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19 have often been overlooked. Thus, Khalatbari-Soltani et al (2020) call for the systematic recording of these dynamics for identifying vulnerable groups in the early stages of a pandemic. Patel et al (2020) suggest that deprivation is likely to be associated with increased VSID from COVID-19 in three ways. Firstly, more deprived neighbourhoods often experience overcrowding which results in increased risk of infection compared to less densely populated areas. Secondly, poorer people are more likely to be employed in roles without opportunities to work from home which also increases risk of exposure. Finally, poverty is a risk factor for chronic comorbidities that in turn predict severe illness and hospitalisation from COVID-19, such as cardiovascular disease (Mehra et al., 2020), diabetes (Peric & Stulnig, 2020) and obesity (Steinberg et al., 2020).",1.0,COVID-19,True

94,"We applied a Kulldorff spatial scan statistic (Discrete Poisson model) implemented in SatScanTM software version 9.6.1 to perform the spatial analysis scanning to detect unusual clusters of COVID19 cases across the surveillance area. A spatial scan statistic is a cluster detection test that detects the location of clusters and evaluates their statistical significance (Kulldorff et al., 2005; Kulldorff, 1997). This was done by gradually scanning a window across the study area, noting the number of observed and expected observations, based on population (ONS, 2011b), inside the window at each location using a Discrete Poisson model. For any given position of the centre, the radius of the circle changes continuously so that it can take any value. For each circle, the spatial scan statistic calculates the likelihood of the observed number of cases occurring inside and outside of the circle. The circle with the maximum likelihood is the most likely cluster, and thus the least likely to have occurred by chance. This method tests the null hypothesis that cases are randomly distributed. Statistically significance suggests that unusual spatial clustering is unlikely to have occurred by chance. The isotopic circular scan method employed by the software has previously been validated for identifying clusters of other infectious disease, such as malaria (Coleman et al., 2009), HIV (Namosha et al., 2013; Tanser et al., 2017), tuberculosis (Smith et al., 2018), and various chronic diseases (Cuadros et al., 2019; Tomita et al., 2020).",1.0,cluster,True

The output, a novel database, was used for regression analysis to identify factors that predict cluster membership (Section 5.2), and for geospatial analysis to produce maps representing teleconnections (Section 5.3).""",1.0,case,True
100,"3.5.3 Statistical analysis and spatial representation of significant clusters Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors that predict whether individual cases of suspected severe COVID-19 occur in unusual clusters. All measures reported in Table 3 and Table 4 were included in the regression model. While the IMD was included in the binary regression, we also conducted an ANOVA to determine whether mean differences in deprivation and affluence occur between areas with clusters and areas characterized by random distribution. In the UK, deprivation is often associated with early transmission patterns (Balasegaram et al., 2012), and high rates of contagion (Rushton et al., 2007). Thus, it is possible that deprivation is a common denominator for all areas with suspected cases of COVID-19, rather than a distinguishing feature of cluster membership. ANOVA was computed to explore more nuanced spatial differences between each cluster, and areas with cases that do not occur in clusters. Regression output and cluster output from SatScanTM was used to display the relationship between determinants of clusters visually. The cluster output from SatScanTM was converted to a layer (`cluster shapefile') within ArcGIS Pro 2.6.0. Of 41 clusters identified, 13 were statistically significant (P < 0.05).

Both the cluster shapefile and UK shapefile were converted to rasters and combined to create a unique raster displaying the Relative Risk of clusters in 3-D. The unique raster was then converted to a TIN in order to be represented clearly in ArcScene.

159,"4.2.2 Regression analysis A binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate factors that are associated with cluster membership. Given the highly unequal distribution of cases by binary categories, the probability cutoff was set to .6, as distinct from the usual cutoff of .5 for randomly distributed binary data (Calabrese, 2014), and the model parameters were set to predict the log-odds of membership in the major category (randomly distributed cases) compared to the minor category (unusual clusters). We also performed bootstrap sampling to account for dependencies between cases in clusters. This analysis did not change the P-values or significant predictors in the regression model. The results indicate that 12 of 16 variables that input to the Access to Healthy Assets and Hazardous Index (AHAHI), and 4 rural and urban categories are significant predictors of whether cases are distributed randomly or appear in unusual clusters by population (Chi-square ,"" 2028.36, df "","" 26, P "","" .00). Age, sex, Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) Decile, the remaining 4 AHAHI variables (Accessibility to leisure centres, gambling districts, Green Space and dentists) and 3 rural and urban categories (Urban major conurbation, Urban city and town and Rural town and fringe) are not significant. The model correctly predicted 41.3% of cases that appear in clusters and 98.7% of cases that do not appear in clusters, giving an overall percentage correct prediction rate of 92.5%5. Table 5 displays the binary logistic regression results for the independent variables that were found to be associated with cluster membership. Compared to randomly distributed cases, cases in clusters are more likely to be located closer to pubs/bars/clubs, Blue Space, off licenses, Passive Green Space, as well as in areas with higher levels of Nitrogen Oxide, and in RUC categories `urban minor conurbation', `urban city and town in sparse', `rural town and fringe', and `rural village and dispersed'.

507,"One year into the COVID-19 pandemic research related to public health, epidemiology, and urban planning has advanced knowledge and understanding about the groups in society that are particularly vulnerable to severe illness from COVID-19. Most research about vulnerable communities and regions considers the association between COVID-19 cases and individual domains, such as deprivation or urbanisation. To our knowledge, the only prior study to use an approach similar to the methodology presented here is Kiaghandi et al. (2020) who examined the relationship between confirmed COVID-19 cases in Harris County, Texas and 46 variables across five domains, including access to health services, and environmental exposures. However, the study did not distinguish between severe illness and asymptomatic or mild cases. Further, their research used aggregate measures collated from a census to estimate the demographic characteristics of patients rather than individual records. Thus, while granular, the approach is limited for identifying communities vulnerable to severe illness and/or death. The trends identified may more accurately reflect transmission, rather than underlying susceptibility.",1.0,COVID-19,True
508,"Severe illness from COVID-19 requiring emergency medical services reflects the intersection of exposure and underlying susceptibility. Vulnerability to severe symptoms is the outcome of complex interactions between individual demographic characteristics and community-scale socio-economic and environmental factors. Our approach, identifying and interrogating unusual clusters of severe illness from COVID-19, and investigating associations between unusual clusters and social and environmental features of landscapes offers a methodology for further supporting vulnerable communities and regions in real-time.",1.0,COVID-19,True

510,"Our spatial analysis revealed 13 statistically significant clusters of suspected COVID-19 cases (Figure 2) with rates of severe illness ranging from 951 to 3,417 per 100,000 population. Regression analysis identified 13 factors that predict cluster membership. Overall, the predictive accuracy of our regression model is high, with lower specific accuracy for cases occurring in clusters compared to cases occurring outside of clusters. However, the proportion of cases predicted in clusters and outside of clusters are both acceptable and suggest good model fit.",1.0,cluster,True
511,"Compared to the reference condition (urban towns and cities), clusters of severe illness are more likely to occur in urban minor conurbations, urban cities and towns in sparse areas, rural towns and fringe areas, and rural villages and dispersed areas. Clusters occur closer to pubs/bars/clubs, off license stores, and Passive Green Space, and further away from fast food, tobacconists, GP practices, A&E hospitals, and pharmacies. The strongest predictors of cluster membership are closer location to Passive Green Space (such as commons and wilderness areas) and higher levels of NO2. Strong associations were also found to PM10 and SO2 levels7.",1.0,cluster,True
512,"Some landscape scale trends are consistent with wider literature. For example, NO2 concentrations are associated with respiratory hospital admissions more generally (Pannullo et al., 2017) as well as COVID-19 related mortality (Kiaghadi et al., 2020; Travaglio et al., 2021). Our results also provide support for other research demonstrating increased vulnerability to disease in urban areas",1.0,respiratory,True
513,"7 The small range of mean values for SO2 (.9-1.9 µg m-3) has almost certainly inflated the odds ratio and effect size for this pollutant. Similarly, the wide odds ratio confidence interval for SO2, compared to all other variables, suggests a high degree of uncertainty. Further, PM10 comprises numerous air pollutants, including organic matter, and has a long-range transport of thousands of kilometres (Malcom et al., 2010). The complex composition and movement of PM10 may explain the trends observed in our study, particularly in more regional and coastal areas where industrial activity and marine aerosols can contribute to concentration levels (Byrd et al., 2010).",1.0,area,True

516,"Other findings are less consistent with assumptions about landscape teleconnections and health outcomes. The likelihood of cluster membership simultaneously increases at locations closer to off license stores and pubs/bars/clubs, but more distant from fast food venues and tobacconists. The AHAHI, and associated literature, assumes that access to all `healthy' assets promotes better health condition while access to `hazardous' assets facilitates poorer health condition (Green et al., 2018). These trends may be related to the nature of amenities and services in rural areas compared to urban areas, and may explain why some retail environments increase likelihood of cluster membership while others do no. Rural towns often contain local pubs while tobacconists and fast food venues are less common. Thus, distance from both retail outlets (more commonly found in more densely populated areas) and health services may reflect poorer access to services more generally, and thus greater vulnerability to illness (Jordan et al., 2004).",1.0,cluster,True
517,"Similarly, health literature suggests that closer proximity to green space is associated with better health outcomes (Daras et al., 2018). We found that clusters are more likely to occur closer to, rather than more distant from Passive Green Space, like commons or conservation areas. This may be related to the nature of Passive, as opposed to Active green spaces. Passive Green Space like commons is likely to reflect urban periphery or rurality while Active Green Space like gymnasiums tend to be located in urban centres. The varied relationships between landscape features and vulnerability in urban compared to more regional areas, deserve more detailed consideration. For example, it is possible that closeness to Passive Green Space reflects social behaviour during the pandemic. In a perspective piece published in this Special Edition8 we examine the relationship between landscape features and the implications for COVID-19 exposure and underlying susceptibility in more depth. During extended phases of lockdown parks and arboretums became social hubs that were poorly monitored by local authorities. News reports documented continual violations of social distancing rules in public spaces like beaches and common green areas. Thus, improving the monitoring and enforcement of social distancing in these spaces may be a future avenue for mitigating high rates of severe COVID-19 cases.",1.0,cluster,True

Category Three, `Coastal Urban', includes clusters in predominately urban areas near Skegness and Grimsby. These clusters are characterized by deprivation, and further distance from all services and beneficial physical environments.

555,"Bioecological models suggest that health outcomes are the cumulative result of complex interactions between individual demographic and biological factors, and the social characteristics of wider environments (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Eriksson et al., 2018). Social factors may reflect both exposure to transmission of a contagious virus, (e.g. poorly designed housing estates), and underlying susceptibility related to pre-existing health conditions (Patel et al., 2020).

559,"The characteristics of clusters in more affluent areas, including two with very high relative risk (10, 6) suggests that the dynamics of vulnerability vary markedly from clusters in poorer regions. Firstly, affluent clusters tend to be in more regional locations including urban peripheries and rural areas which are typically occupied by older communities (ONS, 2020c). In the U.S., rural communities with high rates of severe COVID-19 symptoms are characterised by aging populations and greater distance from health services (Lakhani et al., 2020). Similar characteristics may explain high relative risk in more peripheral and rural clusters in the East Midlands. With one exception (Skegness), the average age of patients located in the Peripheral Inner Urban clusters is higher than all other clusters, and Rural and Mosaic clusters are located further from health services. These dynamics indicate a `rural paradox'; lower risk of transmission, greater susceptibility to severe symptoms, and less access to the medical services required to meet the needs of susceptible communities. Taken together, these observations suggest that the relative contribution of demographic, socio-economic, and environmental factors to vulnerability varies depending on wider geographic location. Factors that influence underlying health susceptibility, like older age and distance from health services, may be stronger predictors of severe illness than socio-economic status in regional locations that are less exposed to transmission risks. In contrast, deprivation and high-density urbanism may outweigh the benefits of closeness to, or distance from, physical features of the built environment. In these cases, it is likely that susceptibility related to deprivation, and exposure related to urbanization, are more powerful drivers of overall vulnerability than access to health services or retail outlets.",1.0,cluster,True
560,"Similar to closeness to passive green spaces discussed above, our findings about vulnerability in rural areas suggest some policy responses for future pandemics and phases of lockdown. News reporting during the first national phase of lockdown suggests that the public viewed rural areas as less vulnerable to contagion and mortality related to COVID-19 compared to urban areas (e.g., McCarthy, 2020). Further, rural communities reported the phenomenon of people from urban and peri-urban areas `flocking' to rural regions for recreation during phases of lockdown when only essential travel was legally permitted (Asquith, 2020). In the event of future phases of lockdown, mitigating high rates of severe illness in rural areas with aging populations may require more stringent policing of travel between urban and rural areas.",1.0,area,True
561,"In summary, factors and processes that explain vulnerability to severe COVID-19 illness and or death are complex and highly location-specific. Bioecological models traditionally focus on the interaction between complex social systems while urban theories emphasise distal associations within physical environmental landscapes. We suggest that social and physical landscape factors rightly belong in a theoretical space akin to Bronfenbrenner's Mesosystem, which includes processes and interactions that occur within homes, communities, and neighbourhoods (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). Figure 11 visualises what this Mesosystem might look like.",1.0,COVID-19,True

The dotted arrow indicates the interaction between socio-economic factors and physical landscape factors within the Mesosphere. The granularity of our analysis, facilitated by the high resolution of the data, offers some important insights for supporting the most vulnerable communities in real-time during the early phase of a pandemic when laboratory testing is limited and public policy is informed by cases in the community. In the case of COVID-19, those vulnerable communities include deprived urban neighbourhoods and more affluent regional neighbourhoods. 6.5 Strengths and limitations There are three limitations of the research. Firstly, big data does not capture individual behaviour; distance from green space and other amenities does not reflect use. Secondly, factors beyond the scope and scale of this research may affect ambulance use. People within close proximity to hospitals with A&E services are more likely to access those services directly rather than calling an ambulance. Similarly, willingness to call an ambulance may vary between communities. Poor health literacy, including ability to recognize symptoms of illness, is often associated with deprivation (Niksic et al., 2015). As a result, it is likely that our data does not represent all severe cases of suspected COVID-19 in the study region. Thus, qualitative community scale research is needed to ground truth the trends and associations reported here. Finally, without data linkage, suspected COVID-19 cases cannot be confirmed. However, the preliminary diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 is based on the assessment of trained medical professionals following the guidelines and algorithms that were widely employed by medical services in the early phases of the pandemic before rapid testing was available. Further, measures taken by ambulance paramedics, including blood oxygen levels (Soltan et al., 2021) and self-reported OTD (Wee, 2020; Patterson, 2020; Printza & Constantinidis, 2020), have been demonstrated to predict positive cases with a high degree of accuracy. The need for rapid response is paramount. The spatial accuracy of our approach, using a novel routinely collated dataset demonstrates a methodology for identifying vulnerable communities in real-time, as well as understanding the demographic, socio-economic, and environmental characteristics of vulnerability across dynamic geographic landscapes.",1.0,social,True

The opportunities for minimising the impacts of a pandemic include reducing the underlying susceptibility of communities as well as minimising transmission. In part, this involves urban planning to enhance opportunities for health behaviours. Improving the safety of green spaces for cost-free exercise, and increasing infrastructural and financial access to healthy food would promote healthier lifestyles in deprived communities. Further, improving access to health services in more affluent and isolated communities may help to mitigate the most severe outcomes of a pandemic. However, in both cases this requires top-down financial investment to encourage healthy retail outlets to locate in deprived neighbourhoods, and health services to locate in low-density neighbourhoods.",1.0,flu,True

Unequal health outcomes and severe illness in the UK reflects decades of systemic disadvantage and accumulated vulnerability (Marmot et al., 2020).
