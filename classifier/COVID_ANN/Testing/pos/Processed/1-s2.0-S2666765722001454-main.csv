9,"We report wastewater surveillance of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 based upon 24-h composite influent samples taken weekly from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) on Vancouver Island, BC, Canada between January 3, 2021 and July 10, 2021. Samples were analyzed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain re­ action targeting the N1 and N2 gene fragments of SARS-CoV-2 and a region of the replication associate protein of the pepper mottle mosaic virus (PMMoV) serving as endemic control. Only a small proportion of samples had quantifiable levels of N1 or N2. Overall case rates are weakly correlated with the concentration (gene copies/L) and with the flux of viral material influent to the WWTP (gene copies/day); the latter accounts for influent flow variations. Poisson multimodal rank correlation accounts for differences between the four WWTP and shows a significant correlation with a significant positive intercept. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis confirms a cut-off of cases based on amplified/not-amplified experimental data. At the optimal cut point of 19 (N1) or 17 (N2) cases/week/100,000 the sensitivity and specificity is about 75% for N1 and 67% for N2.",1.0,spread,True

39,"The Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus has left millions of people infected and left billions of others affected. Hosts can spread SARS-CoV-2 as early as 24-h after infection during a 2-week incubation period during which symptoms may or may not present (Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: implications for infection prevention precautions 2022). The longevity and frequency of asymptomatic transmission can delay clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2 (Xagoraraki and O'Brien, 2020) and can reflect local testing resources rather than an accurate estimation of true prevalence (Majowicz et al., 2005). Accordingly, widespread commu­ nity transmission can occur prior to the adoption of any appropriate precautionary action (Wu et al., 2020). These limitations have caused researchers to take alternative approaches for identifying SARS-CoV-2 in populations through active surveillance that can provide an earlier warning of an outbreak and accordingly, significantly lowering the epidemic curve (Ibrahim, 2020). Previously, wastewater testing has been central to public health responses in other infectious disease epi­ demics, including the near-eradication of poliovirus (Asghar et al., 2014) as well as detecting outbreaks of enteroviral and hepatitis in­ fections (Pellegrinelli et al., 2016).",1.0,Coronavirus,True
40,"Wastewater monitoring provides an opportunity for active surveil­ lance. Hosts infected with SARS-CoV-2 shed the virus in their fecal matter, creating the opportunity to gather data from the excreted fecal matter in wastewater for a set population (Larsen and Wigginton, 2020; Philo et al., 2022). In contrast to passive surveillance based on clinical testing, active testing of viral molecular markers in wastewater presents benefits, including (i) detecting SARS-CoV-2 from both symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers; and (ii) sampling a large portion of the population to provide better insight as to the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in such populations (Mallapaty, 2020).",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
41,"The most common method to detect SARS-CoV-2 is qPCR, addi­ tionally over the COVID-19 pandemic other methods have been recently used such as droplet qPCR and (PCR)-based or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) (Ramírez-Chavarría et al., 2022; Alhama et al., 2022).",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
42,"The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has been correlated to clinical testing data in over 60 countries (Medema et al., 2020; Ahmed et al., 2020; Randazzo et al., 2020; COVIDPoops19 Dashboard, 2022), demonstrating the relationships between both datasets, as well as the capacity and feasibility of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to provide robust data regardless of clinical testing uptake. At smaller scales, several examples exist where testing of wastewater in concrete settings has allowed proactive isolation and targeted clinical testing for impacted populations (Betancourt et al., 2021; Ahmed et al., 2021)",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
43,"WBE offers potentially unbiased surveillance in areas where testing is not as readily available. Community testing applied routinely might provide a warning of virus present in the community; several authors have noted that it cannot replace standard testing (Wu et al., 2020; Michael-Kordatou et al., 2020). Many WBE studies focus on a correlation of viral concentration with case rates in the population. Such correla­ tions are significant when relatively high case rates occur in larger population centers. A recent report of WBE in communities of different sizes across Scotland provides clear correlations of viral concentration with clinical case rates, but there was substantial variability in the sig­ nificance of the correlation in smaller population centers (Fitzgerald et al., 2021).",1.0,area,True
44,"This study explores the utility of WBE for surveillance on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada between January 3, 2021, and July 10, 2021. This is a relatively low population density region that experienced a clear wave of infections in the study period. The peak infection case rate was relatively low compared with other studies (< 60 cases/week/ 100,000) although there were cases of the disease continually throughout the study period.

While a wealth of literature now exists regarding sample preparation and analysis strategies, surveillance methods used to inactivate, filter, concentrate and extract viral RNA and the correlating analysis by qPCR were developed based on literature and best practices available in the absence of any international consensus at the beginning of this study (O'Reilly et al., 2020). The accumulated dataset supports a variety of statistical analyses to explore correlations of case rates with viral concentrations and viral influent flux based on quantified samples. The focus is on the sensitivity and specificity of qPCR methodology for WBE as it applied in the region during the period of study.",1.0,case,True

Historically, the sewersheds and the CHSAs are associated with munic­ ipal and other local boundaries so there is an overlap of CHSA bound­ aries with sewershed boundaries. However, rural properties within a CHSA may not be served by the associated sewersheds. The rural pro­ portion in the CHSAs that comprise the Greater Victoria and Greater Nanaimo sewersheds is less than 2%. The Saanich Peninsula WWTP serves three CHSA. One of these (Town of Sidney) is fully served by the SP sewershed. A second (North Saanich) is 45-55% served by the sew­ ershed with the balance on rural septic systems; the case counts from the North Saanich CHSA were scaled by 50%. The third CHSA (Central Saanich, population 19,330) is 80-85% served by WWTPs with the balance on rural septic systems. No scaling of the case counts was done to correct for the rural population. The Tsawout First Nation, whose population of 1,600 lies within this CHSA, operates an independent WWTP. In the absence of finer grained case data, cases that may have occurred within this subpopulation are included in the case total for this CHSA even though they would not contribute to the viral loading at the SP WWTP.

77,"The available data has several internal characteristics: 1) Influent samples (24-h composites) were obtained as subsamples of regulatory monitoring from four WWTP. While we used 24-h com­ posite influent wastewater samples, recent research suggests that sam­ pling sludge contains a majority of the enveloped virus (Balboa et al., 2021) especially if clinical case counts are low (Balboa et al., 2021; Developing a Wastewater Surveillance Sampling Strategy, 2022). Col­ lecting solids requires specialized equipment that was not uniformly available at the four sampling locations (Fitzgerald et al., 2021; D'Aoust et al., 2021). Our sampling was aligned with pre-existing regulatory and operational sampling methods used for monitoring by the WWTP op­ erators. Although these four sources represent roughly half the popu­ lation of Vancouver Island, they differ in numbers of clients served by a factor of ten (Mcloughlin Point Greater Victoria. 300,000, MCL; Greater Nanaimo, 100,000, GN; Saanich Peninsula, 33,000, SP; French Creek, 28,000, FC). The case rates for each sewershed are derived from Com­ munity Health Service Area (CHSA) data that generally overlap sew­ ershed areas but include significant rural populations not served by the SP and FC WWTPs. 2) The samples were fractionated by two different methods based on either skim milk fractionation (SMF; 34% of samples) (Philo et al., 2022) or PEG precipitation (PEG, 66%) (Wu et al., 2021). Within each type there were differences in initial, reconstitution, and final elution vol­ umes as methods were refined. Roughly 90% of the samples in the final dataset were processed with one of two closely related PEG methods or one of three closely related SMF methods. Since the volumes and volu­ metric precision within each method varies, the propagated dilution factors varied; the propagated volumetric uncertainties were relatively constant (8.0 - 8.2% RSD).",1.0,flu,True

A calibration curve was made for each individual qPCR plate: each qPCR analysis contained one calibration dilution sequences for all three targets, and each set of samples was determined relative to the calibration from the same qPCR analysis. Day-to-day variations in the slope, intercept, and regression statistics of the linear CT as f(log copies/well) calibration were moni­ tored and provided the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantifi­ cation (LOQ) for each sample. Samples that failed to amplify or were amplified to a level below the LOD were flagged as not detected (ND); samples amplified to a level between the LOD and LOQ were flagged as detected not quantified (DNQ). Retrospectively, calibrations were examined to reject those that lay outside a control chart band based on 90% probability of the mean of the standard errors in y of the regression. Within the accepted dataset the uncertainty in the qPCR replicates on a single plate is 16% RSD.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
79,"We had anticipated using PMMoV normalized values of N1 and N2 concentrations as others have employed (Feng et al., 2021; D'Aoust et al., 2021). PMMoV is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single stranded RNA virus that is known for its extraneous stability and for being the most abundant human virus shed through stool resulting in its preva­ lence in sewer systems globally (Symonds et al., 2018; Kitajima et al., 2018). Using a gene sequence from the replication-associated protein for amplification, PMMoV concentrations show little seasonality making it a useful fecal indicator (Symonds et al., 2018). In the event, the dataset contains a large proportion of ND and DNQ samples for SARS-CoV-2 targets N1 and N2. Table 2 gives an overview of the dataset from the perspective of the numbers of samples available, detected, and quanti­ fied. The PMMoV target was quantified in all samples done in parallel with the N1/N2 targets. Fig. 1 panel A includes PMMoV values from 125 independent samples and replicates for the four sewersheds.

While health data show the presence of cases, this is not always observed in our data. Some of the cases on Vancouver Island occurred in places where a proportion of the population live outside sewershed service areas within a CHSA. This discrepancy will not allow the sampling at the WWTP to have a clear overlap with the population case rate in that specific area. Focusing only on the timing of quantified samples in the whole dataset, there may be a correlation between overall case rates and the concen­ tration of the target quantified.",1.0,case,True

(2021) for similar sized WWTPs in Scotland. Fitzgerald et al noted that the con­ centration observed was in part dependent upon the influent flow at the various sampling locations and times and recommended the use of influent flux to correct for this variation (flux , influent flow during the sampling period x measured concentration).

The flux data were scaled by a factor of 108 to reduce their magnitude for modelling while preserving the rank order. Table 3 gives the model outputs. Two features are significant: (i) the slope (flux correlated by cases) is significant (N1) or highly significant (N2); and (ii) the intercepts (cases in the absence of a viral flux) are positive and highly significant for both markers.

171,"A focus on amplified/not amplified requires a shift in perspective to binary statistics to explore the utility of the dataset. This is akin to binary diagnostic testing where a test result (positive/negative) is used to infer the level of a continuum parameter (cases) with respect to a cut-off value. In this context, we know that there was some level of COVID19 infection throughout the period at all sample locations. A perfect diagnostic would return the result ""amplified"" for most of the samples. In our real case the question is - what level of cases is required to ensure viral material is amplified in PCR? The optimum cut-point in case rate was determined by optimization of the area under the Receiver Oper­ ating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The cupointr() function in R was used for the ROC analysis and to calculate the Youden statistic to identify the optimal cut point for the number of cases needed from the case rate data to detect a positive result in the sample.

False negatives (FN; N1 10, N2 10) are samples which are amplified but incorrectly classified above the cut-point. True negatives (TN; N1 72, N2 65) are observations of non-detects correctly identified as less than the cut-point.

190,"We can draw two types of general conclusions from the data pre­ sented. The first is the value of influent viral marker flux (copies/day) in place of the more usually reported use of viral marker concentrations (copies/volume). Our results strongly support the suggestion of Fitz­ gerald et al. (2021) that flux provides a direct normalization across multiple locations. In our case, the seasonal variation of influent flow is correctly removed from the variance in the concentration data as seen in the near-zero intercept in the correlation of case rates and viral flux. Normalization with measured PMMoV is an indirect method to make this type of correction; direct use of WWTP data appears more effective.",1.0,flu,True
191,"The second conclusion is the identification of a cut-point in cases below which both the sensitivity and the specificity of the method decline to make the positive identification of cases from measured marker amplification unreliable. The actual values we determine are of lesser value than the clear indication that there is a lower limit of cases that can be identified from WBE data. Analytical limits of detection and quantification apply to WBE above some threshold; the ROC analysis, based solely on amplified/not amplified within defined instrument criteria, points to an effective lower limit of identification of cases by WBE methods. In regions with high population density, large volume WWTPs, and high case rates, quantitative correlations are possible.
