23,INTRODUCTION,0.0,,False
24,"Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a commonly used excipient in a huge amount of ubiquitously used cosmetics, drugs, and household products.1 Most recently, PEG 2000 is being used in the artificial lipid layer of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, namely Comirnaty® (BNT162b2 by Pfizer and BioNTech) and Spikevax® (mRNA 1273 by Moderna),1 but not in the Johnson & Johnson or AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines. Multiple individuals reported anaphylaxis to COVID-19 vaccination,2 with an incidence of 2.5 cases/mio doses for Moderna and 4.7/mio doses for Comirnaty® vaccinations, being 2-4 times higher than expected for other vaccinations.2 The ingredient PEG has been discussed to cause allergic reactions and to be responsible for the increased incidence of anaphylaxis.3,4 However, recent data showed that anaphylaxis reaction rates to all PEG-containing and non-PEGcontaining COVID-19 vaccines are similar to rates reported across several common other vaccines.5",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
25,"Anaphylaxis to PEGs has been rarely reported before the pandemic,3,6 especially considering the widespread use in medicine.1,7 Additionally, the amount of PEG used in laxatives, eg, as Moviprep® (100 g PEG 3350) is multi-fold higher as compared to that used in COVID-19 vaccines. Comirnaty® contains 0.05 mg PEG 2000 and the amount in Spikevax® is not stated, but can be expected to be similar.8 However, it seems that broad media and internet coverage concerning the anaphylactic reaction following the Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer vaccinations ratcheted public concern about the allergenic potential of PEG.2",1.0,pandemic,True
26,"The number of patients seeking testing for PEG allergy/COVID-19 vaccination allergy has been dramatically high. Furthermore, people have increasingly consulted the internet for health information in the last decades. It has become a key data source, also for public health promotion.9,10",1.0,COVID-19,True

A further limitation might be the automatic completion of search terms provided by Google, which might bias people's search behavior. The interest in PEG allergy might be underestimated because not all patients suspecting an allergy consulted the internet. Furthermore, people might have searched with unspecific questions, not included in the specific google key terms.

The scientific community always have had some low-level interest in PEG allergy, which already increased after 2016 but significantly peaked after the PEG-containing vaccination availability. Although the numbers of patients with a reported PEG allergy substantially increased in the last 2 years, absolute numbers still remain low. Thus, the overrun of allergy departments by patients asking for PEG allergy testing is not and has never been medically justified.
