60,"As of May 1, 2022, there have been more than 500 million people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 6 million deaths worldwide (1). On November 9, 2021, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1529, was first detected in South Africa, and the World Health Organization (WHO) named it the Omicron variant on November 26, 2021 (2-4). Due to the high transmissibility of the omicron variant, a new wave of global epidemics has occurred over the last several months (5-9). Moreover, a large number of pediatric patients with omicron variant infections were detected (10-12).",1.0,respiratory,True
61,"In late February 2022, a wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection rapidly appeared in Shanghai as of May 4, 2022, and 601,942 patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infections, including 503 deaths. All the new viral genomes in Shanghai were clustered into the SARS-CoV-2 BA.2.2 sublineage (13). Patients under 18 years old, including several patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), were admitted to the quarantine ward in Shanghai Children's Medical Center affiliated with Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine during this outbreak in Shanghai. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no reports of Omicron variant infections among the pediatric CHD population.

He was admitted to the hospital due to high fever and shortness of breath during this episode. The chest X-ray showed bilateral lung exudation. The patient was given oxygen inhalation with a mask during the first 5 days. Digoxin was used to strengthen the cardiac output, and furosemide was used for diuresis. The patient was successfully discharged after 20 days of hospitalization without the need for mechanical ventilation. Three mild patients (patients 2/4/5) underwent slide tracheoplasty while correcting the cardiac anatomy. These three patients were treated with nebulization and occupational therapy while they were in the quarantine ward to prevent airway obstruction due to excessive secretions. There was a special mild case (patient 3) who unfortunately suffered cardiac arrest after VSD repair and was saved by ECMO in the intensive care unit. Then, a second intervention was performed during ECMO support. Residual moderate tricuspid regurgitation and a 3 mm ASD were reserved.

Several studies have also found that children have been susceptible to the Omicron variant in the last 6 months (10-12).

We reported a series of 13 cases of pediatric patients with Omicron variant infections and congenital heart disease that have not been reported in previous studies. All patients were successfully discharged with no complications.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
92,"Since the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020, children with CHD have been a vulnerable group for this type of disease. The severity, complications, and mortality of pediatric patients with CHD were higher than those without CHD. In an early study in 2020 (15), 53 CHD patients were reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Ten patients were children (2 moderate-severe cases), and there was a total of 3 (6%) deaths. In a retrospective study by Strah et al. (16) in 2021, a total of 160 cases of CHD pediatric patients were included. The patients with CHD were younger (1 vs. 11 years), had a longer length of stay (22 vs. 6 days), had a higher complication rate (6.9 vs. 1.1%), had higher mortality rates (3.8, 0.8%), and had higher costs ($54,619 vs. 10,731; p < 0.001 for all). Moreover, in a recently published study comparing children with CHD and non-CHD patients, it was found that the pediatric patients with CHD had a higher ICU admission rate (55.6% vs. 31.9%) and higher use of mechanical ventilation (18.5% vs. 6.5%).",1.0,pandemic,True
93,"As the first study on CHD combined with the omicron variant, there were no severe cases in our study, and all 13 patients were successfully discharged. This might be because the omicron variant was thought to be less severe than the former variants in terms of the disease severity (17). As was first reported regarding the Omicron prevalence in children in South Africa (10), seven (5%) of 138 children were ventilated, and four (3%) died during the study period.

Furthermore, the Omicron receptor-binding domain increased ACE2 (host receptor) binding, which then worsened the SARSCoV-2 transmission and disease severity (18). The properties of these structures have led to the quick spread of Omicron variants around the world.",1.0,transmission,True

However, patients with CHD might be younger than non-CHD patients when infected. Due to the current policy, children with symptomatic CHD start getting vaccinated against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 6 months postoperation. They did not receive any sort of SARSCoV-2 vaccine. Therefore, the development of effective and safe vaccines for patients of younger ages and special populations is an urgent problem that needs to be solved.",1.0,symptomatic,True
265,"From the perspective of children with CHD, there were also factors that made them more susceptible to infection than non-CHD patients. For children who are being treated prior to CHD surgery, some studies believe that (20) CHD-induced congestive heart failure (left-to-right shunt) or cyanosis (right-to-left shunt) might lead to chronic inflammatory responses. Moreover, the influence of SARS-CoV2 resulted in further immune activation and failure of some lymphocyte subsets.

271,"the surgical field of view since most CHD surgeries require the midsternotomy approach. However, premature removal of the thymus at a young age could also lead to abnormal T-cell differentiation. In a long-term follow-up study (21), thymectomized CHD patients more frequently developed cancer, autoimmune diseases, and atopic diseases and had a higher risk for viral infections (59.5 vs. 19.9%, p < 0.001). In this study, among the 10 postoperative children, all required a midsternotomy approach in cardiac surgery, and the possibility of removal of the thymus during the operation was high, which might be one of the factors why they were more likely to be infected by the Omicron variant. However, with the continuous advancement of surgical techniques, many CHDs can be treated surgically with the minimally invasive operation technique. They can be treated with a subaxillary incision, which could significantly reduce the proportion of surgeryrelated thymectomies.",1.0,disease,True
272,"Another possible factor might be cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Most CHD surgeries still need to be performed with CPB. However, early studies pointed out that the severe systemic inflammatory response caused by CPB (22, 23) often leads to the disturbance of immune function in the short term after surgery. In a case series study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections after cardiac surgery (24), the effect of CPB on the inflammatory system was regarded as a confounding factor of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it requires special attention. All the postoperative patients underwent CPB during surgical repair in our study. Perhaps this might be one reason why the patients were infected.",1.0,case,True
273,"In addition, some of the children with CHD had genetic abnormalities, the most common being Down syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome and Noonan syndrome. These genetic defects were associated with immune deficiencies, which may increase the risk of Omicron infection and the occurrence of severe diseases.",1.0,disease,True
274,"Another finding in our study was that it took a long hospital time (16.4 ± 2.9 days) for CHD patients to improve to meet the discharge standard, which was not reported in previous studies. A longer duration of infection might increase the risk of the patient developing severe disease. Therefore, one question to ask is how can we shorten the required time to reach the adequate CT value to prevent mild cases from developing into severe or critical cases? The baseline CT value in some of our patients was above 35. These patients were in the incubation period or early stages of the disease, and a decreased CT value could be found on Day 7 (Figure 1) in these patients.",1.0,disease,True
275,"Since 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected cardiac surgery to varying degrees (25, 26). The operation time of preoperative patients was delayed. Some children with severe heart diseases lost their indications for surgery and died. In our study, 3 patients were preoperatively enrolled. They were able to meet the discharge criteria at 22, 11, and 14 days. At present, there are several reports on the treatment of critically ill CHD after negative nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 (27) and",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

These studies have a positive effect on exploring the reasonable timing of surgery in children with CHD during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. As clinical staff are working on CHD disease patients, we should increase our attention to this type of research.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
277,Limitations,0.0,,False
278,"This study had several limitations. First, our study was a single-center retrospective study with a limited number of samples and a short study time, and was limited by the selection bias. Second, the main criterion for discharge in this study was based on the CT value of the N gene on the nasopharyngeal nucleic acid test. However, in actual work, we found some sampling bias in the CT value results caused by the sampling techniques of nasopharyngeal swabs. Third, the sampling time of the nucleic acid in our study started from the 7th day after admission. We did not conduct nucleic acid sampling within 7 days because of the following reasons: (1) the possibility of children's CT value reaching the discharge standard was extremely low; (2) due to the large number of patients in the ward, it was reasonable to reduce the number of samplings in order to reduce the risk of medical staff being infected. Such a protocol inevitably led to a certain deviation in the nucleic acid CT value curve.",1.0,curve,True
279,Conclusion,0.0,,False
280,"Children with CHD are at risk of infection with the Omicron variant. As the first report in CHD children with Omicron, none of the patients in our study became severe cases, and careful treatment of the underlying diseases might lead to successful discharge. Although the Omicron variant might be less serious, it took a relatively long time to meet the discharge criteria.",1.0,case,True
