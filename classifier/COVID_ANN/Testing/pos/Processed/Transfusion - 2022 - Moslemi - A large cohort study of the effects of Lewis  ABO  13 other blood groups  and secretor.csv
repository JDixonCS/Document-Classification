8,"Abstract Background: Previous studies have reported Blood type O to confer a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while secretor status and other blood groups have been suspected to have a similar effect as well. Study design and methods: To determine whether any other blood groups influence testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 severity, or prolonged COVID-19, we used a large cohort of 650,156 Danish blood donors with varying available data for secretor status and blood groups ABO, Rh, Colton, Duffy, Diego, Dombrock, Kell, Kidd, Knops, Lewis, Lutheran, MNS, P1PK, Vel, and Yt. Of these, 36,068 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 whereas 614,088 tested negative between 2020-02-17 and 2021-08-04. Associations between infection and blood groups were assessed using logistic regression models with sex and age as covariates. Results: The Lewis blood group antigen Lea displayed strongly reduced SARSCoV-2 susceptibility OR 0.85 CI[0.79-0.93] p < .001. Compared to blood type O, the blood types B, A, and AB were found more susceptible toward infection with ORs 1.1 CI[1.06-1.14] p < .001, 1.17 CI[1.14-1.2] p < .001, and 1.2 CI[1.14-1.26] p < .001, respectively.

23,"Early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a link was reported between ABO blood type and infection susceptibility.1 Evidence for this link has been mounting as size and quality of data have grown,2-5 although a clear explanation for the mechanism behind this link has yet to be definitively established. One of the several explanations that has been put forward is a potential interaction between anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies and SARSCoV-2 viral products.6,7 This would explain why most studies conclude that ABO type O, with presence of both anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the blood, confers the lowest infection susceptibility.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

152,"There have been conflicting reports regarding ABO blood type and SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. One study has pointed to AB being least susceptible,24 while most studies seem to agree that type O is least susceptible to infection.2,3,5-9,11,13,15 Conflicting results may well reflect the small sample sizes for the majority of published studies or because of the setting of the studies.

In the absence of a functional FUT2-encoded enzyme, the FUT3-encoded enzyme will convert almost all precursor into Lea and result in the Le(a + bÀ) non-secretor phenotype, while its presence will result in the Le(a-b+) secretor phenotype.

It is worth noting that, although not significant, the secretor susceptibility model does report an elevated OR for secretors, which is what we would expect. Since both the secretor and Lewis models have large cohorts, the fact that Lewis is significant, but secretor is not, hints that susceptibility might be more directly linked to Lewis phenotype, and not secretor status.

The specific binding of norovirus viruslike particles to ABO and Lewis antigens has been demonstrated.33 Norovirus uses secreted Lewis antigens for attachment to human epithelial cells.34-36 This favors a theory of Leb perhaps acting as a mediator for SARSCoV-2 infection in a similar manner. In addition, both Lewis and secretor status associate to microbiota of the mucosal surfaces which could explain the association to infection susceptibility.37,38 The present results provide sufficient evidence of a potential link between SARSCoV-2 and the Lewis blood group to warrant future investigations exploring the association in greater detail and testing these theories experimentally.",1.0,case,True
