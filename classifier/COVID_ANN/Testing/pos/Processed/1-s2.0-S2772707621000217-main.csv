45,"Methods: The cross-sectional study of 41,228 participants across 290 healthcare facilities in all 30 districts of Karnataka was done among three groups of participants (low, moderate, and high-risk). The geographical spread was sufficient to capture local variations.

Clinical sensitivity was assessed by conducting a longitudinal study among participants identified as COVID-19 positive in the first survey round.",1.0,spread,True
46,"Results: Overall weighted adjusted seroprevalence of IgG was 15.6% (95% CI: 14.9-16.3), crude IgG prevalence was 15.0% and crude active infection was 0.5%.

51,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally and affected 2.58% of the population, with a case fatality rate of 2.12% as of 4 August 2021. In India alone, 31.8 million people were diagnosed with COVID-19 with a case fatality rate of 1.44% (Worldometer ; covid19india.org). As the pandemic continues to progress, most countries from South Asia to Europe have seen a more severe second wave (Jha 2021; Demonbreun et al. 2021; Ward et al. 2020; Salyer et al. 2021). While data on reported cases, deaths, and testing drive the shortterm management of the pandemic, given the high rate of asymptomatic infection in the population that may go undetected (Kumar et al. 2021), it is important to estimate active infection and seroprevalence in the general population for better matching of public health responses to the actual state of the pandemic (Jewell, Lewnard, and Jewell 2020).",1.0,COVID-19,True
52,"Evidence from nationwide surveys in India, conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), reported that the antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 0.73% population during May - June 2020 (first round)(Murhekar et al. 2020), in 6.6% during August-September 2020 (second round)(Murhekar, Bhatnagar, Selvaraju, et al. 2021) as daily cases and deaths peaked in the country, and in 24.1% of adults surveyed and 27.2% of 10 to 17-year-olds surveyed during December 2020 - January 2021 (third round)(Murhekar, Bhatnagar, Thangaraj, et al. 2021). Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu reported the highest number of confirmed cases at the state level (Statista 2021). Seroprevalence varied from 0.13% in Kerala in an early study ending 31 May 2020 to 31.6% in Tamil Nadu in a study ending 30 November 2020 (Department of Health & Family Welfare 2021; Khan et al. 2020; Prakash et al. 2021; Sharma et al. 2020; Malani et al. 2021). In the first round of the survey in Karnataka, the estimated total burden was 27.7% as of 16 September 2020 (Babu et al. 2021), while a higher prevalence of 39.6% was reported in select households (Mohanan et al. 2021). All states in India, including Karnataka, showed a decreasing trend from mid-October 2020 to January 2021(Government of India 2021b).

100,"Similar to the first round, our present study involves several district and state agencies: 290 healthcare facilities across all districts of Karnataka and the associated healthcare workers participated in the effort. Our study is further unique in jointly estimating active infection and IgG antibody prevalence. Despite the sentinel-based nature of the survey, our sampling frame attempted to overcome bias in the facility-based sampling frame by, for example, sampling from pregnant women coming for a regular check-up and sampling attendees of patients instead of the patients themselves (Babu et al. 2021). Additionally, to account for IgG antibody waning, we conducted a longitudinal study for estimating the clinical sensitivity of the IgG ELISA kit, and this enabled an interval estimate of the total prevalence in the state. We also took exclusion criteria into consideration while arriving at population level IgG prevalence. Less than 0.7% of the population had received one dose and an insignificant fraction had received two doses of vaccination. This fraction is included in the IgG prevalence estimate.",1.0,clinical,True
101,"In the first round, overall adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 was 27.3% and active infection was 12.7%. The case-to-infection ratio was 1:40, and the infection fatality rate was 0.05%. (Babu et al. 2021). The estimated IgG prevalence at the end of Round 2 (15.6%) is remarkably lower than the estimated total infection of 27.7% (95% CI: 26.1-29.3) at the end of Round 1 (IgG prevalence 16.8% (15.5-18.1)) (Babu et al. 2021). Tamil Nadu, a neighbouring state, also reported a reduction in March-April 2021 (23%) compared to October-November 2020 (31.6%)(Hindu 2021). In SARS-CoV-2 the initial rapid waning of antibodies is due to the loss of short-lived plasma cells, while the plateau in antibody levels occurs due to establishment of long-lived plasma cells(Zhao et al. 2020). These levels also decline but slowly, and the efficacy of these antibodies is an important aspect of immunity. Assuming the lab-calibrated analytical sensitivity (92.2%) yields an under-estimate of the IgG prevalence in view of IgG level decline (Round 2 began 131 days after Round 1 and 98 days after the active cases peaked in the state). The ICMR third round study (Murhekar, Bhatnagar, Thangaraj, et al. 2021) took two approaches to handle antibody waning - reduction in the optical density thresholds and an independent validation of the testing kit - and reported the adjustments.. We conducted an independent validation via a longitudinal study.",1.0,COVID-19,True
102,"The longitudinal study (conducted on a subset of the recalled Round 1 positive population) yielded a clinical sensitivity of 38.9% during the Round 2 period. The IgG ELISA test used the whole-cell antigen instead of the more specific recombinant nucleocapsid or spike protein antigens (Sapkal et al. 2020). This, along with antibody waning, may have played a role in its reduced clinical sensitivity.",1.0,positive,True
103,"Given the lapse of time between Round 2 and the longitudinal study, the measured clinical sensitivity of 38.9% may be viewed as a lower bound on this sensitivity since fewer days would have elapsed between the date of infection of positive participants and the end of Round 2. By assuming this pessimistic 38.9% value of clinical sensitivity, following the same statistical analysis, we estimated that at most, 35.8% (95% CI: 34.0-37.7) were infected in Karnataka, as of 18 February 2021. Together with the total burden of 27.7% (95% CI: 26.1- 29.3), estimated at the end of Round 1,(Babu et al. 2021), we concluded that Karnataka's COVID-19 burden was between 26.1-37.7% (at 90% confidence), suggesting a significant level of susceptibility (and hence insufficient natural immunity) in the population as of 18 February 2021.",1.0,clinical,True
104,The estimated active infection was 0.0% across all districts. The subsequent rise in infection from March to June 2021 may be due to a combination of effects ranging from immunity waning (Adiga et al. 2021) to the emergence of the B.1.617 variant and its sub-variants (Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium 2021).,1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

106,"As in Round 1, Dharwad had the highest IFR (0.24%-0.50%). This could be due to reporting differences or issues related to clinical practice or travel from neighbouring units to avail critical or tertiary health care facilities at Dharwad (Babu et al. 2021). Further research should explore these hypotheses.",1.0,clinical,True
107,"Males continued to be at higher risk than females (odds ratio 1.22), the vulnerable population in the high-risk category continued to be at higher risk than the low-risk category (odds ratio 1.6), those in the higher age groups continued to be at higher risk than the 18-29 age group (Table 1). However, rural areas were more at risk than urban areas (odds ratio urban 0.89 < 1 rural), a reversal from Round 1. Together with the observations on antibody waning, the",1.0,area,True
108,higher risk for rural areas suggests that the infection continued to be active in the rural areas after it had subsided in the urban areas during October 2020 - February 2021.,1.0,area,True
109,"Pregnant women are known to be more susceptible to respiratory pathogens, and hence to SARS-CoV-2, than the general population (Liu et al. 2020). It is, therefore, reassuring to note that the total prevalence among pregnant women was the lowest, suggesting the hypothesis that their behavioural patterns result in significantly lower contact rates.",1.0,respiratory,True
110,"Serial serosurveys repeated at the same sites can enable the comparison of epidemiological metrics across time. A comparison of IgG prevalence alone between Round 1 and Round 2 suggests that about 17 units have lower IgG prevalence in Round 2, while the remaining 21 have higher IgG prevalence (Figure 1). However, when we compare the total prevalence of Round 1 and Round 2, the latter is mostly lower except for a marginal increase in 11 units (Supplementary Figure 5), possibly due to the reduced clinical sensitivity of the IgG ELISA test kit. Another interesting observation is that while high urbanisation leads to lower CIR (Figure 2), some districts with low urbanisation have low CIR. However, some others have higher CIR, suggesting the need to step up surveillance in those latter rural units (Belgaum, Kolar, Chamarajanagar, and Mandya). Finally, as in (Babu et al. 2021), Figure 3 suggests a possible classification of districts into those with high/low CIR and high/low IFR. Districts with high CIR and low IFR in the top-left quadrant should consider re-evaluating their testing strategies and death reporting.",1.0,clinical,True
111,"As highlighted above, the sentinel-based population survey strategy has enabled the identification of trends over time. Such a survey is also easier to implement in terms of planning logistics for quick deployment. The study findings enable identifying districts that need better testing, reporting, or clinical management, all of which ultimately reduce the number of deaths due to COVID-19. Since the state was far from attaining natural immunity, vaccination coverage should be stepped up.",1.0,clinical,True
