9,"Background: Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) is known to affect the heart and is associated with a proinflammatory state. Most studies to date have focused on clinically sick subjects. Here, we report cardiac and proinflammatory biomarkers levels in ambulatory young adults with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection compared to those without infection 4-8 weeks after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCOV-2) testing. Methods: 131 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic subjects were enrolled following testing for SARS-COV-2. Fifty subjects tested negative, and 81 subjects tested positive. Serum samples were collected for measurement of C-reactive protein, ferritin, interleukin-6, NT-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and cardiac troponin 28-55 days after SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR testing. Results: Biomarker levels trended higher in SARS-COV-2-positive vs negative subjects, but differences in biomarker levels or proportion of subjects with elevated biomarkers were not statistically significant with respect to SARS-COV-2 status. Among individuals with  1 comorbidity, odds of elevated CRP were greater compared to individuals without any comorbidities (odds ratio [OR] , 2.90); this effect size was increased 1.4-fold among SARS-COV-2-positive subjects (OR ,"" 4.03). Similarly, NT-pro-BNP was associated with CVD, with the strongest association in COVID-positive individuals (OR "","" 16.9). Conclusions: In a relatively young, healthy adult population, mild COVID-19 infection was associated with mild elevations in cardiac and proinflammatory biomarkers within 4-8 weeks of mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in individuals with preexisting comorbidities, but not among individuals without comorbidities. For the general population of young adults, we did not find evidence of elevation of cardiac or proinflammatory biomarkers 4-8 weeks after COVID-19 infection. Clinical Perspective: This is a characterization of cardiac and proinflammatory biomarkers in ambulatory subjects following asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection. Young, ambulatory individuals did not have cardiac and proinflammatory biomarker elevation 4-8 weeks after mild COVID-19 infection. However, COVID19 infection was associated with biomarker elevations in select individuals with comorbidities. Clinical study number: H-47423.""",1.0,Coronavirus,True

18,"Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), the infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, presents as an upper respiratory tract infection, and can progress to pulmonary infection (i.e., pneumonia), acute respiratory distress syndrome or systemic infection in some subjects [1,2]. Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 has been documented [3] and can manifest in several ways [4,5]. Cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers have been reported to be elevated in acute COVID-19 infection, especially among individuals requiring hospitalization and intensive care unit [5,6].

120,"up to two months after COVID-19 infection despite normal heart func­ tion [19]. Moreover, echocardiographic evidence of reduced global longitudinal strain despite preserved ejection fraction has been reported among COVID-19 patients, indicating the presence of subclinical cardiac damage [20]. Myocardial damage can occur after COVID-19 infection due to several reasons: microthrombus formation, persistent systemic inflammation, cytokine-mediated pathologic cardiac hypertrophy [21], and direct viral infection. A study of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes demonstrated that troponin release is greatest when iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes are infected with COVID-19 in the presence versus absence of IL-6 and IL-1 [22]. The percentage of infected cells remained constant at 35 % regardless of the presence of ILs, indicating that direct infection likely does play a key role in myocardial damage relative to cytokine-mediated damage. Interest­ ingly, however, autopsies performed in ten patients who died of COVID19 infection failed to demonstrate appreciable evidence of lymphocytic myocarditis, but rather showed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with microthrombi [23]. It is important to note that these patients had severe (i.e., fatal) COVID-19 infection and may not be representative of the mildly symptomatic and/or asymptomatic patients in our study cohort. Altogether, it seems likely that direct COVID-19 infection of car­ diomyocytes plays a key role in COVID-19-related myocardial damage, but whether there is persistent viral infection within the myocardium remains elusive.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Indeed, post-COVID-19 CRP elevation have been reportedly to be greater in diabetics compared to non-diabetics [24]. The degree of CRP elevation has also been shown to predict COVID-19 outcomes [25]. However, it is important to note, due to small sample size, the single CRP cutoff of 5.0 mg/L used in this study was not adjusted for the potential confounding effects of sex (higher CRP in females), race (higher CRP in African Americans), and body mass index (higher in obese individuals) on CRP levels [26].",1.0,disease,True

Like CRP, ferritin is an acute phase reactant that reflects the degree of acute and chronic inflammation as well as monocyte/macrophage activation [27]. Studies have shown ferritin to be an independent predictor of COVID-19 severity [28] and a marker of COVID-19 renal involvement [29] and thromboembolism [30]. Our study demonstrates that the odds of elevated ferritin did not differ by COVID-19 status when measured 4-8 weeks after detection of COVID19. This could have been because the individuals in our study had mild COVID-19 infection and ferritin may be associated with severe COVID-19 infection [28]. Alternatively, ferritin, is an acute phase reactant and may have decreased back to normal levels by the time of sera collection 4-8 weeks later.",1.0,positive,True
123,"In our study, the percent of individuals with elevated IL-6 did not differ between COVID-19 cases and controls. While higher IL-6 has been shown to predict risk of mortality from acute COVID-19 infection [8], it is important to note that contrary to our subjects with mild disease, the subjects in former studies reporting this association were very sick (i.e., hospitalized, requiring ICU stay). Furthermore, like ferritin, IL-6 may have been elevated at the time of infection but may have had decreased back to normal by the time of sera collection 4-8 weeks post-infection. Indeed, IL-6 is secreted by macrophages at sites of infection and, like CRP and other acute phase reactants, decreases back to normal levels around one week after infection [31]. Our study used a cutoff of 25 pg/ mL, which has been shown to have prognostic value for mortality and intensive care unit admission in subjects with COVID-19 pneumonia [32]. In the same study, mild COVID-19 pneumonia had mean IL-6 of 7.7 pg/mL, moderate 35.5 pg/mL, and severe 321 pg/mL [32]. Thus, a cutoff of 25 pg/mL in a young, healthy adult population may have",1.0,COVID-19,True

We used a cutoff of 0.01 ng/ mL (rather than the clinical cutoff for myocardial ischemia of 0.03 ng/ mL) for troponin based on population-based screening studies [14]. It is important to note that other studies of COVID-19-related cardiac injury may have used the high-sensitivity, rather than standard, troponin assay, to predict myocardial damage [33]. Nonetheless, we did not find troponin elevations in young, healthy adults, 4-8 weeks after asymp­ tomatic or mild COVID-19 infection, even in those with pre-existing CVD. Elevations in troponin and NT-pro-BNP have been associated with COVID-19 mRNA vaccination-related myocarditis [34]. However, the time frame of our study (latter half of 2020) makes it unlikely that study subjects had received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, which were approved by the FDA on August 31, 2021 [35] and January 31, 2022 [36], respectively.""",1.0,positive,True
127,"Our study has several limitations. First, sera samples were collected 4-8 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. While we still found evidence of some biomarker elevations, these and other biomarkers could have been elevated had the sera been collected closer to the time of COVID-19 infection. Our ability to detect differences in proportion of elevated biomarkers by COVID-19 status was also likely hindered by the small sample sizes in our study, particularly the small proportion of in­ dividuals with elevated biomarkers, which is to be expected among young, healthy adults. Nevertheless, the biomarker elevations we did find to be elevated are likely true positives considering the relatively long time between COVID-19 testing and biomarker quantification. Second, our study was cross-sectional. A longitudinal study comparing biomarkers before and after COVID-19 infection would have helped account for the large inter-individual variation in circulating biomarker levels. Third, levels of cardiac troponin and CRP were not assessed using high sensitivity assays. Use of high sensitivity troponin portends greater prognostic utility compared to the conventional cardiac troponin assay [37,38]. Data is mixed for high sensitivity compared to standard CRP [39,40]. Nevertheless, use of standard assays may have precluded detection of more subtle increases in biomarkers below the limit of detection of conventional assays that may be more likely in a population of young, healthy adults. Finally, different cut-offs in biomarker levels, specific for sex, race, age could have resulted in different findings. Given the small sample size, we used a single cut-off for the biomarkers, which is another limitation of our study.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
