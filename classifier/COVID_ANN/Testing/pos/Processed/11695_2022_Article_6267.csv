5,"Abstract Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to a worldwide suspension of bariatric and metabolic surgery (BMS) services. The current study analyses data on patterns of service delivery, recovery of practices, and protective measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic by bariatric teams. Materials and Methods The current study is a subset analysis of the GENEVA study which was an international cohort study between 01/05/2020 and 31/10/2020. Data were specifically analysed regarding the timing of BMS suspension, patterns of service recovery, and precautionary measures deployed. Results A total of 527 surgeons from 439 hospitals in 64 countries submitted data regarding their practices and handling of the pandemic. Smaller hospitals (with less than 200 beds) were able to restart BMS programmes more rapidly (time to BMS restart 60.8±38.9 days) than larger institutions (over 2000 beds) (81.3±30.5 days) (p,""0.032). There was a significant difference in the time interval between cessation/reduction and restart of bariatric services between governmentfunded practices (97.1±76.2 days), combination practices (84.4±47.9 days), and private practices (58.5±38.3 days) (p<0.001). Precautionary measures adopted included patient segregation, utilisation of personal protective equipment, and preoperative testing. Following service recovery, 40% of the surgeons operated with a reduced capacity. Twenty-two percent gave priority to long waiters, 15.4% gave priority to uncontrolled diabetics, and 7.6% prioritised patients requiring organ transplantation. Conclusion This study provides global, real-world data regarding the recovery of BMS services following the COVID-19 pandemic.""",1.0,coronavirus,True

12,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on healthcare services worldwide. During the early stages of the pandemic, the majority of elective surgical services needed to be paused [1]. There was evidence that recent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) would significantly increase risks associated with surgery [2]. With regards to bariatric and metabolic surgery (BMS), the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorder recommended all nonemergency bariatric surgery be suspended during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. Studies confirm that BMS services were almost entirely paused during this phase of the pandemic [4, 5].",1.0,COVID-19,True

15,"The COVID-19 pandemic arrived on top of a worsening obesity pandemic [6]. Patients with obesity are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19-related disease, and the COVID-19 pandemic has had a further adverse impact on obesity rates due to the repeated periods of `lockdown' and disruption to both medical and surgical weight management services worldwide along with changes in lifestyle leading to less physical activity and more calorie consumption [7, 8].",1.0,COVID-19,True
16,"With the development of vaccines and improved medical therapeutics for COVID-19, we may have put the worst of the pandemic behind us but the critical question at this stage is what lessons can be learnt from the international response to the COVID-19 pandemic and how this may influence the strategic response to recovery of BMS services, further COVID-19 waves, or other global pandemics. Concerning BMS this should have a particular focus on how it will be possible to maintain services or recover swiftly in such eventualities.",1.0,vaccine,True

The GENEVA study was a global, multicentre, observational study of BMS (elective primary, elective revisional, and emergency) performed between 1/05/2020 and 31/10/2020 in the adult (18 years). Detailed methods have been published previously [9, 10]. This study was registered as a multinational audit at the host institution [blinded] with registration number 5197. The hospitallevel data collected detailed and anonymised information about surgeons, their respective bariatric surgical centres, the effect and handling of the pandemic at their centres, local perioperative COVID-19 safety protocols, and the timelines for the pandemic in their respective hospitals along with the chronology of the hospital response. Data for time points were collected to understand how different practices handled the pandemic. These time points included the first case diagnosed in the city, the first case admitted to the hospital, the peak in hospital admissions, stoppage, and subsequent restart of services. Only practices with all valid time points were considered for this part of the analysis. Data on these aspects were captured from participating surgeons through 28 questions (Appendix 1).",1.0,pandemic,True

111,"A further significant finding in this dataset was that privately funded institutions were able to resume BMS services more swiftly than government institutions. Again, the reasons for this are likely to be multifactorial and may vary globally. Many private institutions were also smaller (just under half of the private hospitals had less than 200 beds) and may have been influenced by the factors described above. Furthermore, in many healthcare systems such privately funded hospitals would not have been treating large numbers of COVID-19 patients. During the recovery phase many countries saw close collaboration between private providers and government institutions. In some areas, these private units were specifically utilised as the `green' sites described above to treat publicly funded patients that would otherwise have been treated in government institutions [15, 16]. This form of collaboration allowed for elective surgery to resume much more rapidly in many areas than relying upon government institutions alone.",1.0,flu,True

There were also major changes concerning how the whole range of weight management services was delivered including access to services and the increased use of telemedicine for care delivery [19].

Data were self-reported and not externally validated, therefore is reliant upon the accuracy of data input by individual collaborators. Due to the global nature of this study, there was significant variation in healthcare structure across participating centres (particularly the relationship between government and privately funded institutions). Data regarding screening and precautionary measures for COVID-19 was collected before the widespread introduction of rapid lateral flow tests for this purpose, and therefore data regarding their utilisation was not collected.
