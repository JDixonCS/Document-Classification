5,"Introduction: A key aspect of the public health response to COVID-19 in Scotland was enhanced community surveillance, including testing in dental settings. Across Scotland, dental settings offered patients over 5-years-old the opportunity to participate in community surveillance of COVID-19. Methods: A Health Inequalities Impact Assessment (HIIA) was conducted to understand the differential impacts the programme would have on the population and to improve the accessibility of the programme. HIIA is a tool to allow the assessment, understanding, and mitigation of impacts on people of a proposed policy or practice. It fulfils an organisational duty to meet the requirements of the Equality Act and Fairer Scotland Duty. The HIIA was conducted rapidly in parallel with the programme development. An action research approach included an online workshop, consultation, review of population data and a literature search. Results: Adjustments were required to improve the programme's accessibility. Stakeholders, including dental teams from across Scotland were involved in the consultation and brought their front-line experience in different settings. Common issues identified included digital literacy and access, language and cultural barriers to participation, and issues relating to the implications of a positive COVID-19 result. Literature indicated limited evidence on the acceptability, accessibility, and equity of asymptomatic COVID-19 surveillance. Conclusion: This HIIA was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. As an example of good practice in tackling inequalities in access to programmes it should represent the benchmark for other similar initiatives.",1.0,COVID-19,True

8,"Understanding how COVID-19 affected different groups in the population was a key aspect of the public health response and was crucial for informing public health measures and policy decisions. Public Health Scotland led this work under the banner of Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 in Scotland (ESoCiS) (Health Protection Scotland, 2020a). The work included data streams from community, secondary care, schools and also dental settings. Each stream aimed to gather evidence about prevalence, routes of transmission and symptoms.",1.0,COVID-19,True
9,"The COVID-19 Surveillance of Asymptomatic Patients in Dental Settings programme provided SARS-CoV-2 testing to patients screened as asymptomatic attending dental appointments from 3/8/20-1/4/21. Testing was initially offered to both children and adults attending Urgent Dental Care Centres (UDCCs) where the programme was active. Methods and early results are described by Conway et al. (2021).

The available literature concluded that selfswabs carried out for COVID-19 were well tolerated and viable.

41,Evidence from other diseases such as HIV concluded that; offering mouth swabs increased the uptake of testing compared to blood tests in young people; home testing by the user was generally favourable; an oral swab was more acceptable to the participants than a blood test; including further testing of the blood for other sexually transmitted infections led to increased acceptability. A paper related to influenza found that patients assessed collection of nasal swabs to be acceptable either by selfswab or carried out by healthcare workers.,1.0,disease,True

Children are a small proportion of the patients seen for emergency dental care and prioritisation of care over participation in the surveillance programme was often reported.

74,"Having a representative population involved in the surveillance programme was important, therefore specific attention was required to ensure coverage across remote, rural and island locations. The programme was able to reach across Scotland and had good coverage in most locations, including the islands. Other groups which may otherwise have struggled to access this type of testing were those experiencing homelessness and those involved in the criminal justice system. The Public Dental Service is the main provider of dental care for these individuals and therefore the programme could be extended to this population. However, it was noted that the implications of self-isolation for these individuals may have been more difficult to manage via existing pathways. Similar considerations were made for those with substance misuse and addictions issues, who may have been less likely to access care, and if they had accessed care, refusal to participate in asymptomatic testing was expected to have been higher.",1.0,self-isolation,True

It was therefore reasonable to assume that the potential negative impacts may have driven refusal to participate in the programme from those most at risk of these impacts, resulting in an unequal population representation in the data. Impacts were noted in ability to attend work, exclusion from education and recreation beyond the home, accessing healthcare being more difficult in the short term and an individual being excluded from social events for the isolation period. Some of these impacts may be mitigated through the support that was available in the Test and Protect system and Local Authority support measures.",1.0,positive,True
78,"Data from the 20-week report indicated that the programme was able to reach an even spread of participants across SIMD quintiles as shown in Table 2 (Public Health Scotland, 2021b). The decision to site the programme in UDCCs initially may be an explanation for this, as the need for urgent care is higher in lower socio-economic groups, therefore providing greater opportunity to participate for these individuals. This contrasts with routine, nonemergency care, where a socio-economic gradient would be more likely to occur (Public Health Scotland, 2021c).",1.0,spread,True

Although not directly part of the HIIA, a local quality improvement project ran in tandem and sought the views of the public and patients (Wemyss et al., 2022). The focus of that engagement was on understanding reasons for refusal to participate and findings were reported to the national steering group. It is essential, where possible, that the public viewpoint and lived experience of individuals are incorporated into impact assessments. This is a limitation of the HIIA, driven by the pace and available consultation methods at the time during a pandemic.",1.0,pandemic,True

Reports available on the Public Health Scotland website record difficulties engaging a wide range of patients or patient groups prior to the pandemic in more traditional ways (NHS Health Scotland, 2013a; NHS Health Scotland, 2013b). It is likely therefore that a variety of options for the public to engage will be more inclusive and might include a mix of face to face conversations, targeted use of social media, patient group websites, online focus group events and engaging patient advocacy groups.",1.0,pandemic,True
