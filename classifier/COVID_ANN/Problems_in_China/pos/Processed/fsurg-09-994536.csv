21,"Background: Traumatic spinal cord injuries (TSCIs) are worldwide public health problems that are difficult to cure and impose a substantial economic burden on society. There has been a lack of extensive multicenter review of TSCI epidemiology in northwest China during the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Method: A multicenter retrospective study of 14 selected hospitals in two provinces in northwest China was conducted on patients admitted for TSCI between 2017 and 2020. Variables assessed included patient demographics, etiology, segmental distribution, treatment, waiting time for treatment, and outcomes. Results: The number of patients with TSCI showed an increasing trend from 2017 to 2019, while there were 12.8% fewer patients in 2020 than in 2019. The male-to-female ratio was 3.67:1, and the mean age was 48 ± 14.9 years. The primary cause of TSCI was high falls (38.8%), slip falls/low falls (27.7%), traffic accidents (23.9%), sports (2.6%), and other factors (7.0%). The segmental distribution showed a bimodal pattern, peak segments were C6 and L1 vertebra, L1 (14.7%), T12 (8.2%), and C6 (8.2%) were the most frequently injured segments. In terms of severity, incomplete injury (72.8%) occurred more often than complete injury (27.2%). The American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale of most patients did not convert before and after treatment in the operational group (71.6%) or the conservative group (80.6%). A total of 975 patients (37.2%) from urban and 1,646 patients (62.8%) from rural areas were included; almost all urban residents could rush to get treatment after being injured immediately (<1 h), whereas most rural patients get the treatment needed 4-7 h after injury. The rough annual incidence from 2017 to 2020 is 112.4, 143.4, 152.2, and 132.6 per million people, calculated by the coverage rate of the population of the sampling hospital.",1.0,epidemiology,True

29,"Conclusion: The incidence of TSCI in northwest China is high and on the rise. However, due to pandemic policy reasons, the incidence of urban residents decreased in 2020. The promotion of online work may be an effective primary prevention measure for traumatic diseases. Also, because of the further distance from the good conditional hospital, rural patients need to spend more time there, and the timely treatment of patients from remote areas should be paid attention to.",1.0,pandemic,True

33,"Traumatic spinal cord injuries (TSCIs) can cause significant morbidity and mortality (1). These injuries are often caused by heavy injuries, traffic accidents, falling accidents, etc. and are centered in the labor age population and elderly population (2, 3). Despite the economic differences between countries or regions, this traumatic disease has caused a large loss of the working population, imposing a serious economic burden on patients and families, which leads to high health expenditure and economic losses (4, 5). Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for patients with TSCI--severe damage to the spinal cord usually means permanent impairment (4, 6, 7). Therefore, attention should be paid to primary prevention. Understanding injury risk factors, incidence, and demographic characteristics can better guide the promotion of preventive measures and the allocation of medical resources (8, 9).",1.0,disease,True
34,"The global incidence of TSCI was 10.5 cases per 100,000 persons, but the incidence of TSCI varies across countries and regions (1). China is a country with rapid industrial development and frequent traffic flow; this brings more injury-causing factors, and the spinal trauma caused by it increases yearly (10). Therefore, it is necessary to update Chinese TSCI incidence data in real time. However, most existing studies have focused on East China, while there has been a lack of extensive multicenter review of TSCI epidemiology in northwest China in recent years (6, 11-14). The level of economic development in northwest China is far behind that in East and mid-China regions, and their characteristics of injury factors should be different, so its epidemiological data cannot fully refer to the data in the East and mid-China regions.",1.0,case,True
35,"In this study, we aimed to discuss the epidemiological characteristics and risk factors of TSCI in northwest China. Thus, we used the multicenter retrospective data from 2017 to 2020 to expand the coverage area of previous studies and discuss the impact of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on society (15).",1.0,area,True

According to the age distribution, it was found that young adults aged 21-40 years make up half of the TSCI population (49.9%). Regarding the occupation, farmers and herdsmen from rural or pastoral areas account for more than half of the total patients (58.1%), and the patients from urban areas are mainly workers (11.8%), students (5.5%), and retirees (5.6%). The other occupational groups included government officers (1.0%), technicians (1.1%), enterprise managers (1.1%), serviceman (0.2%), and others consisting of freelancers, unemployed individuals, and selfemployed individuals who together accounted for 6.9% of the total patients. In addition, 8.7% of patients were unwilling to inform their occupational information for other reasons. Apparently, from 2017 to 2019, there were more patients each year than the previous year, while in 2020, there was a decrease of 12.9% compared with the number of patients in 2019 (Figure 2).",1.0,area,True

Other factors include falling objects, violent fights, and other collisions, accounting for 7.0%. Table 2 shows the etiological composition ratio of TSCI in different age groups, in which there is no apparent difference in etiological composition ratio between 20, 21-40, and 40-61 years old groups (P > 0.05). However, the proportion of low-energy injury factors (i.e., slip fall or low fall) was higher in patients 61 years than in other age groups (P < 0.01); nearly half (45.9%) of patients with TSCI over 60 years old are injured by this factor. Table 3 describes the etiological composition of patients of genders.

69,"As can be seen from the statistics in Figure 3, TSCI occurred at the cervical, thoracic, lumbosacral levels, and the proportions in these levels were 33.0%, 36.8%, and 30.2%, respectively. We counted the number of cases per injury vertebral segment, and there were 79.0 patients with singlelevel spinal fractures and 20.1% patients with multilevel (2 levels) spinal fractures. Figure 3 shows that the distribution of segmental injury cases showed a ""bimodal"" pattern; analysis of these data indicates that the two peak injury levels of TSCI were C6 and L1 vertebra. Overall, L1, T12, and C6 were the most frequently injured segments, accounting for 14.7%, 12.2%, and 8.2% of the total cases, respectively. Further, the injury types of each vertebral segment are divided into fracture dislocation, distractive flexion fracture (chance fracture), burst fracture, and compression fracture. Roughly analyzing, the most fracture type of TSCI patients due to cervical injury is fracture dislocation, which accounts for 59.1% of cervical injuries. Compression fractures are more common in TSCI patients due to thoracic injury (exclude T12), which accounts for 48.3% of thoracic injuries; the major fracture type of TSCI patients due to lumbosacral injury (include T12) is burst fracture, which accounts for 55.9% of thoracic injuries.",1.0,case,True

Most patients with TSCI present with IQ, accounting for 39.5%. The next is IP, accounting for 33.3%. Patients who suffered from complete injury included CQ and CP, accounting for 21.1% and 6.1%, respectively. Admission assessment results using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale system are shown in Figure 4B. From the pie chart of patients with TSCI patients, 26.8% of patients suffered from complete motor and sensory dysfunction (ASIA A), 11.2% suffered from complete motor dysfunction with some part of the sensory function retained (ASIA B), 24.2% had inefficient motor functions (myodynamia of most key muscles <3, ASIA C), and 37.7% had useful motor functions remain (myodynamia of key muscles >3, ASIA D).",0.0,,False

336,"Northwest China is an economically backward region in China with low coverage of health insurance and educational level, but it is still developing rapidly. Compared to eastern areas of China, such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangdong, northwest China has several unique characteristics. For example, the proportion of TSCI patients over 60 years in northwest China (24.9%) was higher than that in eastern regions. In addition, the proportion of farmers/nomads (58.1%) in the patients was apparently higher than that in the east (11, 16, 17). Many people are engaged in traditional manual labor or industrial production. Traffic factors and falls are both important injury factors for TSCI in the labor force (industry, agriculture, and husbandry). In the past, we have conducted single-center studies (15). However, despite its underdevelopment with low population density, the total area of five provinces in northwest China is nearly 3.08 million square kilometers, which is a vast area that covers about onethird of the land area of China. To get timely treatment, local patients usually choose a nearby medical center. Therefore, multicenter studies in multiple regions can better represent the whole region than single-center research. We collected the data of patients with TSCI admitted to 14 hospitals located in QH, SN-N, SN-C, and SN-S to understand the changes in the incidence of spinal cord injury patients before and after the emergence of COVID-19 (2017-2020). It can help optimize the allocation of medical resources and provide timely healthcare to the population of more areas.",1.0,area,True
337,"Annual count results demonstrated an increasing trend in TSCI patients from 2017 to 2019. This trend is consistent with previous research findings (6, 15, 18). Unusually, the patient count in 2020 was apparently lower than that in the previous year; there were 12.8% fewer patients in 2020 than in 2019. We speculate that this is due to the shutdown and some ""work-athome"" proposals implemented by the Chinese Government in the first two quarters of 2020 to prevent the COVID-19 epidemic. Recent studies on other traumatic diseases have reached similar conclusions (19-21). In addition, from the perspective of patients from urban or rural areas, the impact of these policies on the urban population is far greater than that on the rural population; the number of patients in the urban",1.0,COVID-19,True
338,"population in 2020 is only 53.3% of the last year, while the number of patients in rural areas in 2020 is still increasing compared with that in the previous year. We consider that this is related to the feasibility of shutdown policies and ""work-athome"" proposals. In cities, where there are more office workers and students, it is easier to work or study online, which largely shields them from exposure to many outdoor injury factors, while agricultural or livestock production is hard to move online. Another indication is that the proportion of patients aged over 60 years in 2020 shows an increase. Due to degenerative bone changes and hypofunction of sensory and motor, nontraffic and low-energy injury factors are more likely to cause TSCI in elderly people than young and middle-aged people (22, 23). Combined with the epidemic policy mentioned earlier, this evidence is consistent with our conclusions. Although the COVID-19 pandemic brings immeasurable economic losses and damages to human health, it also facilitates the development of online work and learning, which makes it possible for many jobs to be performed online from home for a long time. In our conclusion, promoting online office work and learning will make a lot of sense to reduce the incidence of traumatic diseases among people at labor age, especially for urban residents.",1.0,area,True
339,"In our investigation, the male-to-female ratio in patients with TSCI was 3.67:1, which is similar to the rate reported in other regions (6, 14, 24).

There are two age groups with high incidence. Such a ""bimodal"" trend seems to be different from the conclusions of previous studies. Most of the previous literature works described a ""unimodal"" trend with the highest age group around 40 ± 10 years old (6, 17, 25). This may be due to the difference in group spacing and the increased incidence of the elderly under the 2020 epidemic policy. The mean age of patients in our data was 48 (±14.9) years, which was higher than the domestic average age and global average age suggested by previous literature works (10, 26).

The distribution of injury segments showed a ""bimodal"" distribution with C6 and L1 as the centers, with 1-2 adjacent segments (25, 27). Overall, the T11-L3 segment had the highest proportion of injuries, totaling 1,397 cases, accounting for 42.6% of all injured patients.

350,"From the severity of the injury and the outcome of treatment, our results revealed a less optimistic condition after treatment. As a result of consensus, incomplete injury (72.8%) occurred more often than complete injury (27.2%).

The ASIA impairment scale of most patients did not change before and after treatment in both the operational group (71.6%) and the conservative group (80.6%). This illustrates the importance of prevention in improving tertiary prevention measures and rehabilitation techniques as an essential guarantee of improved treatment outcomes. Moreover, the patients who were treated operationally had a higher improvement rate (22.4%) and deterioration rate (0.5%) than the patients who were treated conservatively (improvement rate was 11.6%, deterioration rate was 0.0%). Therefore, improving surgical methods to reduce postoperative complications is also a strategy to improve the efficacy of TSCI.",1.0,area,True

In fact, some hospitals in developed areas are already using helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) to save treatment time for patients in remote areas (29). This kind of traffic measure is not restricted by the topography and is of great value for patients with various acute diseases in rural areas such as the Loess Plateau and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in northwest China. The problem is the high cost of HEMS, which also requires better allocation of resources and funding by the public health system.",1.0,area,True

The incidence of TSCI is difficult to calculate due to the unpredictability of the occurrence of trauma.
