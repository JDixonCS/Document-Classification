20,"Materials and methods: Demographic and psychological data were collected through a cross-sectional survey of 409 participants in a hospital from 20 January to 7 August 2020. COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into three periods owing to the time, place, and scale, including the national outbreak period (a nationwide pandemic period from 20 January to 8 April 2020), sporadic period (a stable period from 9 April to 10 June), and local epidemic period (a local pandemic in Beijing from 11 June to 7 August 2020).

21,"Results: A total of 206 FHWs and 203 SIPs completed the electronic questionnaire. Overall, the prevalence rates of anxiety and depression among SIPs were 3.9 and 19.4%, respectively, while significantly higher prevalence rates (17.7 and 25.1%) were found among FHWs, P-value < 0.05. Psychological status among SIPs did not differ significantly across the three periods. The FHWs were more vulnerable, as their SAS and SDS scores and almost all the dimension scores were significantly higher during the local epidemic period than during the national outbreak and sporadic periods (all P-values < 0.001). The prevalence of anxiety (34.41%) and depression (41.94%) was significantly higher during the local epidemic period (P < 0.001). Logistic and linear mixed models showed that age, sex, and doctor-patient ratio especially, independently influenced most dimension scores of SAS and SDS among FHWs (P < 0.05).",1.0,epidemic,True

31,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) currently represents an unprecedented threat to human health worldwide (1, 2). The first cases of this novel coronavirus (3, 4) were reported in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. Subsequently, the virus was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) by the World Health Organization. The disease has a very strong infectious ability, such that it rapidly spread within a few months and finally became a worldwide health threat. The World Health Organization announced that as of 30 March 2021, 126,372,442 cases had been diagnosed, and 2,769,696 persons had died from COVID-19 due to the high mortality rate and lack of effective treatment (5). The primary routes of transmission include short-distance person-to-person contact, respiratory droplets, and aerosols. The pandemic has relentlessly affected normal social order, caused social panic, and seriously influenced public mental health (6), especially for those frequently exposed to highrisk environments.",1.0,Coronavirus,True
32,"Frontline health care workers (FHWs) are the most important force in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and protecting public health (7). However, due to factors such as direct exposure to infectious individuals, a shortage of protective equipment, prolonged separation from family and friends, and even stigmatization (8), FHWs often experience acute psychological disorders (APDs), such as anxiety and depression (9-11). As early as May 2020, the International Council of Nurses reported that more than 90,000 medical workers had been infected with COVID-19. This figure is likely to be conservative because countries were busy combatting the pandemic. Studies (12, 13) have shown that during the outbreak of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), many frontline staff were infected in their workplaces, which often provoked their loss of emotional control and finally the emergence of APDs.",1.0,spread,True

34,"The effective control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan was followed by a short period of tranquility. However, the calm soon ended in June 2020 with a local outbreak in the Xinfadi Agricultural Wholesale Market in Fengtai District, Beijing. At this time, increasing numbers of medical staff devoted themselves to handling the drastically increasing number of suspected infected patients (SIPs). The state of the spread of COVID-19 worldwide is not positive. Such a serious situation requires not only effective treatment programs but also more medical staff on the frontlines to combat the pandemic. Although doctor-patient mental health is a concern among scholars, the periods covered in most studies are relatively short (3, 14). Therefore, this study investigated the dynamic changes in APDs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic among health care workers and inpatients over a relatively long period, with the main purpose of providing important evidence for psychological interventions.",1.0,COVID-19,True

SIPs were screened by throat swab nucleic acid tests at least twice with an interval of 24 h. The results were reviewed by the team of chief examiners.

The SAS and the SDS both include 20 items, with each item scored on a scale from 1 to 4, indicating none or a little of the time, some of the time, a good part of the time, and most or all of the time. The participants responded according to their psychological and physical symptoms within the past week. According to convention in China, the threshold score of anxiety on the selfreported scale is 50. Scores in the range of 50-59 indicate slight anxiety, scores from 60 to 69 indicate moderate anxiety, and scores above 70 indicate severe anxiety. For depression, the cutoff score is 53, with scores in the range of 53-62 implying slight depression, scores ranging from 63 to 72 indicating moderate depression, and scores above 73 indicating severe depression.",1.0,clinical,True

Therefore, when the experience of tension and danger goes beyond the body's short-term adaptive capability, neural circuits become blocked, which results in mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression (28).

In addition, an in-depth dimensional analysis was conducted to show the main symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, several limitations exist in this study. First, the mental changes experienced by FHWs before and after isolation could not be followed up on due to the cross-sectional survey design of this study.

Furthermore, the prevalence of anxiety and depression among SIPs remained relatively stable, while the prevalence among FHWs fluctuated drastically, with the highest incidence of anxiety and depression occurring during the local epidemic period. Analysis of the related risk factors proved that age, sex, and especially the doctor-patient ratio were independent risk factors for APDs. Our findings suggest that psychological assistance measures should be implemented not only in the anti-epidemic period but also before and after exposure to COVID-19. In addition, more concern and attention should be given to the workload of FHWs.",1.0,flu,True
