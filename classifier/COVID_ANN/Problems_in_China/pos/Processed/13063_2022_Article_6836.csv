6,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had major impacts in many different spheres, including mental health. Children and adolescents are especially vulnerable because their central nervous system is still in development and they have fewer coping resources than do adults. Increases in the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptomatology have been reported worldwide. However, access to mental health care is limited, especially for the paediatric population and in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we developed a brief internet-delivered cognitivebehavioural intervention for children and adolescents with symptoms of anxiety and depression. The aim of this proposed study is to test the efficacy of the intervention.",1.0,COVID-19,True
7,"Methods: We will conduct a two-arm, parallel randomised controlled trial involving children and adolescents (8-11 and 12-17 years of age, respectively) with symptoms of anxiety, depression or both, according to the 25-item Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (t-score>70). A total of 280 participants will be randomised to the intervention group or the active control group, in a 1:1 ratio. Those in the intervention group will receive five weekly sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy via teleconference. The sessions will focus on stress responses, family communication, diaphragmatic breathing, emotions, anger management, behavioural activation and cognitive restructuring. Participants in both groups will have access to 15 videos covering the same topics. Participant-guardian pairs will be expected to attend the sessions (intervention group), watch the videos (control group) or both (intervention group only). A blinded assessor will collect data on symptoms of anxiety, depression and irritability, at baseline, at the end of the intervention and 30 days thereafter. Adolescents with access to a smartphone will also be invited to participate in an ecological momentary assessment of emotional problems in the week before and the week after the intervention, as well as in passive data collection from existing smartphone sensors throughout the study.",1.0,trial,True

28,"Background and rationale {6a} The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had major impacts on many different aspects of health, including mental health [1]. Because their brains are still in development, children could present shortand long-term physiological, cognitive and behavioural changes related to overly challenging situations such as those produced by the pandemic [2]. Their routine suffered major changes due to the restrictions imposed on school and leisure activities, leading to an increase in sedentary behaviours and screen exposure, as well as a decrease in the number of opportunities to socialise with their peers [3]. That could result in loneliness, which is associated with worse mental health outcomes and damages that can persist for years [4]. Financial losses and unemployment can increase the level of stress, as well as the frequency of anxiety, depression, substance abuse and violent behaviour, among parents, which can have an indirect effect on the mental health of the children and adolescents in the home [5, 6].",1.0,coronavirus,True
29,"The emotional and behavioural effects that the pandemic has had on children and adolescents have been well documented [7-12]. Increases in the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptomatology have been reported in various countries, including China [13, 14], Germany [10], India [8] and the USA [15], as have increases in hyperactivity, social conflict, conduct disturbances and other behavioural changes [7, 10].",1.0,pandemic,True
30,"Brazil is one of the countries most severely affected by the pandemic. In May 2021, over one in four COVID19-related deaths occurred in Brazil [16]. It is also one of the countries in which schools were fully closed for an extended period of time [17]. It is estimated that approximately 4 million students dropped out of school during the pandemic in Brazil [18]. In a previous study conducted by our group [19], we found that, among children and adolescents in Brazil, one in three presented with clinical symptoms of anxiety or depression during the pandemic, and that number remained relatively stable from June 2020 to June 2021. In this context, it is vital to develop initiatives to mitigate the potential impact on this population. Some",1.0,pandemic,True

33,"interventions have been shown to reduce the severity of the psychopathology related to traumatic events, such interventions including trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), prolonged exposure for post-traumatic stress disorder and cognitive therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder [20]. In the paediatric population, CBT is a well-established therapy for anxiety and depression [21]. In a meta-analysis, Kramer and Landolt [22] suggested that trauma-focused interventions for children and adolescents should include psychoeducation, teaching of coping skills, parental involvement and some form of trauma exposure. The current scenario, however, presents challenges and obstacles to the implementation of such therapeutic strategies. Brazil is a country of continental proportions, with many remote areas and a limited number of mental health professionals, most of whom reside in the major metropolitan areas [23]. A huge number of children and adolescents are now in need of mental health care, which was already difficult to access before the pandemic [24, 25]. During the pandemic, fear of contamination aggravated that scenario, as did the social distancing mandates and the temporary closure of some supporting services. Fortunately, online access to mental health services has now become more common [26]. Even though most studies of telemental health care have involved adult patients, it has been shown to be applicable in the paediatric population as well [27]. Therefore, telepsychotherapy could be a valuable tool during the COVID-19 pandemic and in other contexts in the future.",1.0,area,True

Sleep quality will be assessed with an adapted version of the Single-item Sleep Quality Scale, which is comparable to other sleep scales such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [56].

Guardians will answer only the questions on the four-item composite version related to suicidal ideation (MFQ-SI), a topic that is not covered on the RCADS-25. - PedsQL--The PedsQL family impact module is a 36-item parent-report questionnaire that aims to assess the impact of chronic medical conditions on the quality of life of the family [49]. It has been adapted for use in Brazil [60]. We will use its fiveitem family relationships subscale to assess family dynamics. The subscale employs a 5-point Likert scale with responses ranging from ""never"" to ""almost always"" on topics such as ""lack of communication between people in my family"". - SDQ--The original SDQ is a 25-item questionnaire on child and adolescent psychopathology that has been adapted to many languages and used extensively in various countries, including Brazil [43], in its informant-report and self-report forms. There is an extended version of the SDQ [61] that includes a brief impact supplement (comprising five questions) designed to assess the potential burden related to the psychopathology of a child in areas such as home life and academic performance. For this study, we will use only the SDQ impact supplement, in order to assess the burden of the depressive and anxiety symptomatology. - ARI--The ARI is a seven-item irritability scale that includes six items related to symptoms related to irritability and one item related to the potential impact of irritability [62]. The ARI has been adapted for use in Brazil [45]. - TSQ [48]--Parental satisfaction with the telepsychotherapy sessions will be assessed (in the intervention group only) with an adapted version of the TSQ [48]. It is a 14-item questionnaire that assesses parameters such as difficulties in contacting the therapist and willingness to use telemedicine services again. - EMA of emotional problems--We will deliver an ESM protocol to assess mood, stress and emotion (Table 1).

It is estimated that three quarters of the Brazilian population has internet access, although the level of connectivity is not homogeneous, with some areas lacking stable connections [71]. These factors could therefore limit the access to the intervention to part of the population.
