53,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a serious global health problem that poses threats to both the physical and mental wellbeing. A meta-analysis found that the pooled prevalence of anxiety was 31.9% among the general population during the COVID19 pandemic (1). Another review indicated that anxiety level has increased 3-fold during the COVID-19 outbreak among the general population (2). The anxiety generated could be due to a multitude of reasons including the health risk posed by the virus on themselves and their families, the economic burden on themselves and the fallout at large (3), as well as the enforced social isolation during the pandemic (4). Anxiety is a natural response to stress. The symptoms of anxiety include nervousness, restlessness, fatigue and weakness, palpitations, trouble concentrating and insomnia (5-7). Significantly, studies have suggested that prolonged anxiety can reduce quality of life and weaken the immune system (8, 9) and as a result increases the risk of the SARS-Cov2 infection (10). Further, the restrictive measures imposed to curb the spread of the virus, and the associated changes in lifestyle and work arrangements, as well as the severe limitations in social and physical activities have exacted a heavy toll on people. Over an extended period of time, this could result in mental fatigue and stress. It is not surprising, therefore, that frequency of anxiety has been reported to be an increasing health problem arising out of the pandemic.",1.0,COVID-19,True
54,"The pandemic situation that the world is facing now is not new, albeit, it is much more serious in many aspects compared to outbreaks in the recent past. Likewise, many people affected by previous pandemics have experienced and endured similar situational threats and stress at the individual level. During previous outbreaks, many studies have been carried out to address the issue of mental health and anxiety arising therefrom, and how people handle such problems (11-13). In these studies, it was demonstrated that there is an association between anxiety levels, mental resilience and coping styles (14-16).",1.0,pandemic,True
55,"With regards to teaching and learning, the seriousness of the current pandemic has led most educational systems to adopt online teaching modes, especially in higher education institutions, with all its challenges to teaching and support staff and to students. Transitioning from traditional face-toface to online teaching-learning can be an entirely different experience and/or challenge for both the learners and the educators. Regardless, this is a change that they must adapt to within a short time frame in the face of limited alternatives. They are compelled to adopt online platforms that they may or may not prepared for, depending on the expertise and previous exposure to information and communications technology (ICT) (17). It was pointed out by Doucet A, et al. (18) that the readiness of the staff and students to adapt to these changes needs to be assessed to allow for appropriate implementation of supportive measures. In the same paper, it was also emphasized that there is no one uniform pedagogy that can be applied",1.0,pandemic,True
56,"across all online subjects which, understandably, will be quite varied each with its own unique requirements both in terms of presentation and delivery of the subject matter. All these issues could present a significant challenge and stress for the entire university community (17). Lastly, there is the issue of equity in higher education, an example in case is students from economically challenged background who may face problems of affording online learning devices and/or reliable internet services (19). Essentially, both staff and students alike have to adapt to the changes in operational, teaching and learning modes, and at the same time cope with the uncertainties related to the evolution of the SARS-Cov2 virus, the course of the pandemic and thus movement restriction as well as their own infection risk.",1.0,community,True
57,"As a result, questions on the psychological welfare of members of the teaching community has aroused the interest of the research community, hence, the numerous studies to address this issue. Islam et al. (20) reported that 18.1% (19) and Nayan et al. (21) reported 22% of university students from Bangladesh suffered from serious anxiety. Factors reported to be associated with COVID-19 related anxiety among Bangladeshi university students include lagging academic performance (19) and negative attitudes. A study on Middle-Eastern students from Jordan gave a similar prevalence of 21.5% (22); reported predictors of anxiety were chronic illness and, surprisingly, those with higher income. Yang et al. (23) reported that the prevalence of mild, moderate and severe anxiety among University students in Sichuan Province, China were 31.5, 8.1 and 5.8%, respectively, with medical students and those who paid more attention to pandemic information being more likely to be affected. Another study reported the prevalence of mild, moderate and severe anxiety among medical students in India were 41, 16 and 4%, respectively (24). A local study addressing the impact of COVID-19 related anxiety on mental health among Malaysian university students found that 30.5% experienced mild anxiety, 31.1% moderate anxiety and 26.1% severe anxiety; factors associated with anxiety included age over 20 years, Chinese ethnicity, decrease in family income, spending a lot of time watching COVID-19 related news and lastly, history of personal illness and of SARS-CoV-2 infection among friends and relatives (25).",1.0,community,True
58,"The next question that would be expected is how people facing the stress and anxiety posed by the pandemic cope, and in what way the coping strategies adopted relates to mental health. A study from the United Kingdom (United Kingdom) found that both adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies were used, including socializing with loved ones, exercising, keeping occupied with work or studies, meditating and keeping positive, avoiding negative news on COVID-19, gaming, and taking alcohol (26). An online survey to examine coping strategies used among netizens, nationalities unspecified, found that a large proportion (68.9%) reported that they just hoped for the best, over half (53.2%), just kept themselves busy while around",1.0,pandemic,True

63,"30 to 35% used religion, or share their concerns with others (15). Mental disengagement was found to be the most common coping method used by university students in China to handle their anxiety; this was followed by avoidance and seeking social support (27).",1.0,social,True
64,"With regards to the relationship between coping methods and anxiety, a study among nursing students showed that mental disengagement was predictive of moderate to severe anxiety and lack of humor predictive of severe anxiety (14). Another study done among Polish University students (28), reported that anxiety was significantly and inversely correlated with task-oriented coping style, while anxiety was significantly and positively correlated with emotion-oriented coping style and avoidance-oriented coping style.",1.0,positive,True
65,"From the above, it is apparent that literature on the relationship between coping methods and anxiety in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is generally lacking, both in numbers and coverage. Hence the attempt of the present study to provide some additional data on coping strategies used and their relationship with anxiety among the UTAR community of staff and students. We propose to determine baseline information on the frequency and level of anxiety in this study population, the predictors of COVID-19 anxiety, the frequency of different coping strategies adopted, and the association, if any, between coping strategy and anxiety. Indeed, to date, there has been only one study on anxiety and associated risk factors in Malaysian students (25), and none that address the question of coping strategies and their association with anxiety. Further, we observed that the WHO questionnaire (29) mentions multiple aspects which are deemed relevant and may have an association with anxiety levels, including compliance with preventive measures, satisfaction with support and resources, frequency of updating COVID-19 news, selfrisk perception, preparedness, and perceived self-efficacy, and unwanted behavior. Therefore, in the present study, we also explored these factors which are less often addressed in the literature, in comparison to questions on the associations with knowledge, attitude, and socio-demography.",1.0,COVID-19,True

The higher the score of each subscale, the greater the likelihood for use of that particular coping strategy by the respondent. The 14 subscales in Brief COPE can be classified as ""adaptive"" and ""maladaptive"" coping methods. Adaptive coping strategies comprises the first eight scales which consist of active coping, planning, positive reframing, acceptance, humor, religion, using emotional support and using instrumental support. Maladaptive coping comprises the latter six subscales which include self-distraction, denial, venting, substance use, behavioral disengagement and self-blame (34).

An online survey among Malaysian university students, conducted during the first wave of the infection in early 2020 found that 20.4 percent reported minimal to moderate anxiety symptoms, while 6.6 and 2.8% reported marked to severe and extreme levels of anxiety respectively (35). In another cross-sectional survey conducted in China among college students in the midst of the outbreak in Wuhan, the reported rate of anxiety was 11.0% (38). In comparison, we found that 41% of our students experienced mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety (score of 1-8; CAS) and only 0.6% (score 9) had dysfunctional anxiety.

164,"Our study was conducted almost 1 year into the pandemic, amidst the third wave of COVID-19 in Malaysia. We found that a large proportion of the respondents in this study either reported absence of anxiety symptoms (60.1%) or mild to moderate anxiety (39.0%); only 4 individuals (0.9%) had symptoms indicative of dysfunctional anxiety. There was no significant difference between staff and students overall; however, the proportion of dysfunctional anxiety was higher among staff (2.2%) compared to students (0.6%). These results cannot be compared directly with those quoted; our study subjects are staff and students from a single privately run university in the Klang Valley in Malaysia. Secondly, the tool used for evaluation of the anxiety state is variable across studies. Further, the present study involves people who have gone through the initial wave of COVID-19 as well as several cycles of movement restrictions. Hence, the circumstances were also quite different. In addition, the university in question (UTAR) had been very proactive and had instituted relevant measures to inform, instruct, advice and support students and staff alike throughout the course of the COVID-19 outbreak. This is reflected in the high level of satisfaction with supportive measures provided. Hence, the relatively low numbers who experience dysfunctional anxiety.

The subscales can be conveniently classified into 2 or 3 categories; in this study we divided them into adaptive and maladaptive approaches (36). The most frequent coping method used by the respondents was acceptance (70.5%), followed by active coping (45.9%) and positive reframing (38.7%), all of which are considered to be adaptive coping practices. These 3 subscales also fall into the approach coping category based on the approach-avoidant 2-factor model. Self-distraction, a maladaptive form of coping was also frequently used (33.9%); this, according to the approachavoidant model is an avoidant behavior. We note that the common models used for classification of coping styles are somewhat over-simplistic and that overlapping classification is frequent (39).",1.0,positive,True
190,"It is noteworthy that the proportion of respondents who frequently adopt maladaptive coping, with the exception of self-distraction, was quite low, ranging from 4.8% (substance use) to 10.4% (venting). In comparison, the proportion of respondents who use the various adaptive coping methods ranged from a low of 12.9% (humor) to a high of 70.5% (acceptance).

It is acknowledged that coping is a rather complex process that is influenced by multiple factors underlying both the situational and dispositional coping responses. In this study, the situation underlying the stress posed is the COVID-19 pandemic and all its associated negative impacts, existential, psychological, social and economic. Overall, we observe positive coping in a relatively larger proportion of the university community, which we believe is related partly to the fact that, at least among staff, a stable job with an assured income and partly to the support that staff and students received from the university throughout the entire duration of the local outbreak to date.""",1.0,positive,True

192,"Multiple linear regressions indicated that maladaptive coping and presence of comorbidities are the significant predictors of coronavirus-related anxiety in this study. It is hypothesized that maladaptive coping strategies would lead to development of more prominent or severe pandemicrelated psychological symptoms. This was confirmed in a study that demonstrated a strong association between the use of maladaptive coping strategies and anxiety symptoms in relation to the pandemic (40); in particular, self-blame was found to be related to more severe anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. In another study of the Australian population (41), low scores in the adaptive coping strategies, acceptance and instrumental support and high scores in the maladaptive coping strategies, behavioral disengagement and self-blame, were predictors of anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic. We did not find any significant association between adaptive coping and anxiety in this study. Some other studies have reported either the lack of or relatively weak association between adaptive coping strategies and anxiety (29-33). Interestingly, one of these studies (32) indicated that adaptive coping is associated with a higher level of subjective well-being, despite the presence of psychological disorders. However, we did not measure subjective well-being in this study, so we are unable to determine whether this is true in our case.",1.0,coronavirus,True
193,"The finding in this study that comorbidities is a predictor of coronavirus-related anxiety is in accordance with that of a previous study (42) which found that people with underlying comorbidities are more likely to have high anxiety score than those without.
