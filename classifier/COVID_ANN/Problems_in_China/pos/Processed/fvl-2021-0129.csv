4,"In December 2019, a new emerging virus causing mild-to-severe pneumonia was detected in China. The virus was described as a variant of SARS-CoV and was called SARS-CoV-2, then declared a pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020. Millions of people contracted the virus and presented with a symptomatology of variable severity, including upper respiratory tract symptoms, systemic symptoms and diarrhea. We herein report a rare skin presentation in a 33-year-old female that occurred both during COVID-19 infection and after receiving the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

7,"Background In December 2019, in the city of Wuhan, severe respiratory infections had been reported and seemed to develop into an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Identified in January 2020 and labeled as a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020, the virus became a global health issue and caused a worldwide sanitary crisis [1]. COVID19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus binding to type 2 alveolar cells in the lung with ACE 2 receptor by a surface spike protein. It can also interact with different cells in the GI tract, kidney, heart and endothelium causing multiorgan failure [2]. The ability of the virus to bind to different cells explains the broad range of symptoms that it can cause. Skin lesions have been reported as a possible symptom of COVID-19. The skin lesions related to this virus consist of five patterns: livedo or necrosis, maculopapular eruptions, urticarial lesions, vesicular eruptions and pseudo-chilblain lesions [3]. Here, we describe the case of a patient with an uncommon pattern of maculopapular eruption during SARS-CoV-2 infection and after receiving COVID-19 vaccine.",1.0,respiratory,True

The severe symptomatology started 24 h before presenting to the emergency department. She also noted having some chills and generalized fatigue within the previous 72 h. The patient was conscious and oriented in space, time and toward people. Blood pressure on admission was 140/80 mmHg, heart rate was 100 beats/min. Patient respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min and SPO2 was 94% on room oxygen. The patient had fever with a body temperature of 38.8C.",1.0,case,True

202,"The pattern of evolution of the lesions is identical, both after the infection and after the vaccine. The IgG value (>100) 5 days postvaccination shows that the patient had developed a strong and quick immune response against the vaccine, which is typical of the secondary immune response and rules out a re-infection. The primary immune response was developed after the patient contracted the virus, and the IgG value was 19 (test performed on 2 February 2021). The patient immune response to the vaccine is typical of a secondary immune response, which is more quick, intense, and durable than the primary immune response, which the patient had against the virus. Thus, a strong activation of the immune response may have caused the skin lesions to appear. Also, the lesions developed after the vaccine in the right forearm were more intense that those developed during the COVID-19 infection.

The most common signs of delayed-type reactions to vaccines are rashes (i.e., various morphologic forms of maculopapular eruptions) [8]. Our patient had a delayed allergic reaction to the vaccine and presented the most common symptom of this allergic reaction, with other associated symptoms preceding the rash (chills, fever, myalgia).",1.0,vaccine,True
210,"While there is precedent for the biological plausibility that certain subpopulations become susceptible to vaccineinduced reactions after multiple exposures [9], this may correlate with our patient's case where the repetitive exposure to the COVID-19 antigen (the first being after the infection and the second being after the vaccine) triggered an intense postvaccination allergic reaction. This may also predict a strong allergic reaction if the patient were to receive a second vaccine dose.",1.0,vaccine,True
211,"It was unlikely that the lesions were due to any kind of medication, noting that the cutaneous manifestations appeared simultaneously with the COVID-19 flu-like symptoms. The patient was not receiving any new medications before the vaccine. A concomitant infection is unlikely, especially that postvaccination CRP value was negative. The pattern similarity after COVID-19 infection and vaccine injection is strong reason to rule out iatrogenic or concomitant infectious causes.",1.0,COVID-19,True
212,"Given the importance of detecting COVID-19 in a global pandemic, it is essential to characterize dermatological manifestations and be aware of unusual lesions pattern that may be correlated or due to COVID-19 infection. It is also important to highlight the correlation between COVID-19 cutaneous manifestations and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine manifestations for patients with known dermatological reactions in COVID-19. In this case, we used corticosteroid and clindamycin intravenous therapy to reduce the dermatological reaction and we noted a complete remission in 1 week. Concerning the histopathology of COVID-19 related rashes, biopsy results from case studies performed by both Reymundo et al. and Mazzitelli et al. show perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the skin lesions of all patients [10,11].",1.0,COVID-19,True
213,"Since Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine triggers an immune response against the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus, it may be possible to predict some side effects that may be caused by the immune response against the vaccination, among patients who already contracted the virus prior to vaccination. The maculo-papular lesions that occurred in this case report are a type of symptom, but other specific or nonspecific symptoms caused by the COVID-19 infection among some patients may be caused after the vaccine dose injection.",1.0,vaccine,True
214,"It has been proven that atopy increases the risk of allergic manifestation after COVID-19 vaccine twofold compared with the population, while no correlation with drug allergy has been elucidated [12]. Knowing that the allergic reaction can be extremely painful and intolerable in some cases, a systemic prevention with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids in the absence of contraindications should be considered in some patients with history of severe allergy.",1.0,COVID-19,True
