6,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) teleprogramming may help reducing travel-related and other financial burdens for patients and maintaining DBS care in special situations. To determine travel-related burdens of DBS patients and explore effects of COVID-19 on DBS care. Travel- and visit-related data of 319 patients were retrospectively analyzed for the first year, five years, and ten years after initiating DBS. Frequencies of in-person and telemedicine visits over the 18-month periods just before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 in Hungary were also compared. Average travel distance during an in-person visit was 415.2±261.5 km, while average travel time was 342.1±199.4 min. Travel costs for the first year, five years, and ten years were 151.8±108.7, 461.4±374.6, and 922.7±749.1 Euros, respectively. Travel distance, age, and type and severity of disease could help identify patients who would particularly benefit from teleprogramming. We detected a significant decrease in the number of visits during COVID-19 pandemic (from 3.7±2.1 to 2.4±2.7; p<0.001) which mainly resulted from the decreased frequency of in-person visits (3.6±2.0 vs. 1.7±1.8; p<0.001). Our results support the introduction of DBS teleprogramming in Hungary which could save money and time for patients while maintaining a secure delivery of DBS.",1.0,COVID-19,True

8,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders (MD) resistant to ­pharmacotherapy1-3. Recently, DBS systems have undergone a remarkable technical evolution. Among several innovations, development of remotely programmable systems has been a considerable step towards resolving several issues of postoperative ­care4-10. First, neurostimulation therapy is usually available only in highly specialized, mostly tertiary MD centers. Therefore, many patients who are treated with DBS have to travel long distances to receive medical care which can impose high expenses and inconvenience on patients and take much of their time. Furthermore, long-distance travels may be challenging for patients with mobility issues and require the help of caregivers. However, especially after the initiation of the stimulation and as the disease progresses, reprogramming of the DBS device may be necessary from time to time. In many cases, the caregivers have to take a day off from their workplaces to be able to accompany the patients for these visits. Second, because of the long distance between the home of the patient and the center, the resolution of stimulation- and device-related problems may take a longer time than optimal. It is sometimes also difficult to keep to appointment times and patients, therefore, need to spend more time than planned at the clinic. Finally, some patients who would be eligible candidates for DBS treatment may refuse to undergo the surgery because of the long-distance, timeconsuming, and costly travels after the initiation of stimulation.",1.0,disease,True
9,"The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digitalization of the healthcare. Telemedicine has been introduced in many countries, also including Hungary.

As a result, for several patients, a greater part of time spent on an in-person visit is not related to the examinations rather to other activities such as travelling which may demotivate patients in visiting to DBS centers. Therefore, teleprogramming could also improve patient compliance at least with annual detailed status assessments--considering that almost all parts of the physical neurological examination and most of the scales used to measure severity of MDs can be performed via video-based consultation which is included in a teleprogramming session--but also with more frequent check-ups.

This tool is feasible for assessing all main motor symptoms of MDs with the exemption of muscle tone and postural s­ tability19,20. In addition, it has been found that patients also prefer video-based consultation over phone ­calls21,22. One reason for the wider use of phone calls compared to video-based consultation can be that the latter requires a more extensive technical background, therefore, its installations and maintenance are more expensive. Because video-based consultation is a fundamental part of the NeuroSphereTM DBS teleprogramming system, in countries where present neurological telemedicine practice is similar to the Hungarian one (e.g., in Norway)23, remote programming could also help to increase general efficacy of telecare.",0.0,,False

Travel distance negatively correlated with the number of in-person visits both on short and long term, however, just after the activation and as the disease progresses, more frequent DBS adjustments may be necessary to maintain desired symptomatic control and quality of l­ife24,25. We found that patients living further than 50 km from the DBS center could benefit from teleprogramming by having more regular DBS adjustments in the early post-activation period and during the disease course. These findings are in line with the results of another recent ­study26, however, it should be also noted that telemedicine usage does not necessarily correlate with travel distance according to other t­rials27, which might imply that independently of travel distance, all patients can derive benefit from improved access to healthcare due to telemedicine.

These results may be partly explained by the fact that only few centers provide dystonia care of which our unit is the main DBS center for dystonia in Hungary with an extensive referral network, therefore, a large portion of patients had to travel long distances to have DBS therapy regularly optimized. In addition, after adjustments of DBS of dystonia patients, immediate symptomatic response cannot often be observed and as a result, more frequent programming may be necessary. Considering that our finding supports the results of a previous survey that found the accessibility of dystonia experts difficult in several European c­ ountries28, teleprogramming could also help improving accessibility of DBS care for dystonia.",1.0,symptomatic,True
239,"In our study, patients aged over 65 years or having 33 points on the Motor Part of the MDS-UPDRS and 5 points on the BFDDS at DBS activation travelled less frequently to our unit over ten years. The main explanation for this may be that travelling can be challenging for these patients due to mobility problems resulting from higher age, more severe symptoms, and disease-related disability. However, closer follow-up and regular DBS adjustment would be essential mainly for this patient group. These subjects may on the one hand be more dependent on their caregivers, if they are available, in travelling to their medical appointments which can substantially increase caregiver burden. On the other hand, in case caregivers are lacking, patients may become unable to travel for in-person visits. Considering this, teleprogramming could be useful not just from economic perspectives, but could also help achieving better symptomatic control and higher quality of life and decreasing caregiver burden.",1.0,disease,True
240,"This analysis revealed that during COVID-19, on-site patient care significantly decreased compared to the period prior to the pandemic, however, there was an impressive increase in the requests for telemedicine care. Although telemedicine has had several advantages, DBS adjustments could not been performed remotely in Hungary. Thus, with the reduction in the number of in-person visits, there has been a risk for a decrease in the effectiveness of DBS treatment and as a result, a deterioration in the condition of ­patients29,30. Considering this, teleprogramming could also help maintaining a more secure delivery of DBS therapy. According to an ongoing survey at our center, a high portion of DBS patients surveyed thus far (63 subjects out of 75, 84.0%) would try remote programming independently of (n,""45, 71.4%) or due to (n"",""18, 28.6%) the COVID-19 pandemic. This is in line with the results of a recent survey by the Parkinson's Foundation and Abbott L­ abs26.""",1.0,COVID-19,True
241,"This study might have some limitations. First, because we analyzed data only on the Hungarian healthcare system, the outcomes should be used with caution in other countries. Second, the study might have also been limited by its single-center design and consequent effects of center-specific characteristics on the outcomes. For example, possible differences in the protocols of DBS care including remote strategies among centers may be present. In our practice, allowing amplitude modification and change between at least two different programming groups are standards of care, while in some other centers, patients may not be allowed any programming options. However, because our unit is a tertiary MD center, our patient pool covers the whole area of the country, therefore, we could collect and analyze data on the potential clinical and economic benefits of remote DBS programming on a nation-wide level. Another strength of this analysis can be the high number of included patients representing different types and severity of MDs. In addition, analyses were performed not just for the whole study population but also the main disorder subgroups, and we could analyze data from all waves of the COVID-19 pandemic period. At this point, it should also be mentioned that our unit is the main DBS center for dystonia, while DBS for ET is more equally available in Hungarian centers.

Possibly lower portion of patients with ET and higher portion of dystonia subjects relative to other units from other countries together with the fact that ET usually shows a good response to DBS treatment even after initial programming settings and less visits are therefore required for adjustments, should also be considered during the interpretation of our findings. options. During the interpretation of our findings, it should also be considered that Last but not least, because the cost per patient is a modeled estimate and not based on any actual data reported by patients, some costs that may occur for some patients (e.g., cost of accommodation for patients cannot travel to site and back to home on the same day due to the long travel distance) or possibility of public transport were not taken into account during the analyses which may also limit the universal applicability of our approach.",0.0,,False
248,"To conclude, by revealing several potential clinical and economic advantages of remote DBS programming, our study supports the introduction of teleprogramming in Hungary. With careful interpretation, our findings may be useful for other countries that also plan to introduce DBS remote programming. Patients who live further from the DBS center, are of older age, have dystonia or represent higher level of disease severity and disability could particularly benefit from this technical innovation. However, further analyses from other countries for which our study can be a good basis and data from clinical practice using remote programming could provide a more comprehensive picture of the role and value of DBS telemedicine.",1.0,clinical,True
