18,"Previous studies on the risk factors of mental health have mainly focused on individual characteristics and environment in the society, family, and school, with few investigating the effect of online courses. Online courses are one of the important education methods nowadays. Many universities around the world have implemented online courses for many years, and more and more children in primary and secondary school have also received online courses due to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although online courses provide more flexibilities in terms of place, time, and pace of learning, children may also face a lot of challenges which may affect children's mental health, such as unstable internet connection, lack of device, difficulties in catching up with online courses, and distraction in learning through a computer for a long time [7]. In this context, online courses could affect children's mental health. Previous studies suggested that online courses have a detrimental effect on mental health of students in the university [8-14]. However, there is no available epidemiological evidence regarding the effect of online courses on mental health of primary and secondary school students, who might be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of online courses.",1.0,Coronavirus,True

Students were selected in 9 cities of the eastern (Beijing, Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province and Dalian in Liaoning Province), central (Zhengzhou in Henan Province, Changchun in Jilin Province and Changzhi in Shanxi Province) and western region (Zhongwei in Ningxia Province, Tongliao in Inner Mongolia and Nanning in Guangxi Province) of China, according to the recommend of National Bureau of Statistics of China (http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/zxfb/201911/t2019 1119_1710340.html). The inclusion criteria were as follows: Firstly, children were chosen from the fifth to sixth grade in primary school or first to second grade in secondary school. Secondly, children whose schools were not reopened due to lockdown policy of COVID19. Thirdly, children and their parents agreed to participate in the survey. If children reported to have chronic diseases or disability, they were excluded. Finally, 540 children and their parents were included in our study.

Because students had online courses by using electronic device (i.e., computer, pad, or smart phone), we assumed that longer online course time (>4 h/day, about 7 classes with 35 min/class, or 6 classes with 40 min/class) could have a similar effect on children' mental health. By assuming that children with inappropriate characteristics of online course had 1.93 (95%CI: 1.16, 3.21) times higher risk of students' mental health problem, the prevalence of mental health problem was about 20% in the whole population [1], ,""0.05, and 1-"",""0.80, we calculated the sample size of 380.

The exact nonresponse rate was not clear, because the survey was an online voluntary investigation. However, most children's parents did not go to work and had much spare time during the survey period. Besides, the survey reached the required sample size quickly.

27,"Mental health measurement The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) [16] was used to assess Children's mental health problems in the study. SDQ is a self-report screening questionnaire that measures emotional and behavioral problems. It is composed of 25 items subdivided in five subscales with five items each: emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems, and prosocial behavior. Each item is scored on a three-point scale (0,""Not true, 1"",""Somewhat true, and 2"",""Certainly true). All subscales excluding the prosocial behavior can be summed to generate the total score, ranging from 0 to 40. The higher score indicates more severe emotional and behavioral problems. We applied the cut-off points of 16 and 20 to define the children's mental health status according to Goodman's standard (http://www.sdqinfo.com). Normal mental health status was defined as SDQ total difficulties score0 and15; borderline mental health status, SDQ total difficulties score16 and<20; abnormal mental health status, SDQ total difficulties score20 and40. We then divides children into borderline mental health problems (SDQ total difficulties score 16-40) vs normal mental health (SDQ total difficulties score 0-15) and mental health problems (SDQ total difficulties score 20-40) vs normal mental health (SDQ total difficulties score 0-15). The Chinese self-report version of the SDQ for 4-17-yearolds has been shown to have good psychometric properties [17].

In our study, we found that nearly one third of students had the difficulty in understanding the content of courses, especially the percentage is high of 43.7% in western region of China. Therefore, attention should be paid on whether children have the difficulty in understanding the content of online courses and supports should be provided for those who do have difficulties, especially in western region of China.

291,"We found that the associations between characteristics of online courses and mental health in primary school students and secondary school students were not significantly different. When stratified by school stage, the smaller sample size contributed to lower statistical power. However, we found that video-recorded online courses and longer online course time were significantly associated with higher SDQ total difficulties score in primary school students. Primary school students may be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of inappropriate characteristics of online courses, because they are younger than secondary school students and might have a lower adaptive capacity to the online courses. Therefore, more attention should be paid on mental health in primary school students when they have online courses.",0.0,,False
292,"Even though our results showed that online courses were not significantly associated with mental health problems (defined as SDQ total difficulties score>20), the increased risk of borderline mental health problems or merely increased SDQ total difficulties score can also reveal that online courses with inappropriate characteristics were associated with children's mental health. Interestingly, when we adjusted for the children's mood and the relationship between parents and children, the regression coefficients between online courses and children's mental health have decreased. Evidence suggested that the positive relationship between parents and children has protective effect on children's mental health [18, 30]. Therefore, parents should pay attention to children's mood and make efforts to improve the parent-children relationships, which may be an effective measure to mitigate the detrimental effect of online courses on the children's mental health.",1.0,positive,True

Although online courses has developed rapidly around the world and become an alternative or supplementary type of education, the shift to online courses is made at very short notice and large-scale online courses lack practical application scenarios, especially in primary and secondary school. It's suggested that deep investigations on the online education are required to provide evidence for appropriate online courses [31].

First, we surveyed the participants from 9 cities in the eastern, central, and western region of China, which facilitates us to obtain results from socioeconomically different regions. What's more, this was the first study to investigate the association between school's online courses and mental health of children. However, several limitations of the present study should be mentioned. First, given the cross-sectional design of our study, it is impossible to infer causality of the relationship between characteristics of online courses and children's mental health. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm the results obtained from our study in the future. Second, although we adjusted for several covariates, we cannot rule out the possibility of residual confounding factors. Third, our study selected limited participants in every city. Forth, even though we selected participants from 9 cities in the eastern, central, and western region of China, the schools were not selected randomly. The generalization of our finding may be limited. Therefore, further studies using random sampling with larger sample size are needed to investigate the association between online courses and children's mental health.",1.0,,True
