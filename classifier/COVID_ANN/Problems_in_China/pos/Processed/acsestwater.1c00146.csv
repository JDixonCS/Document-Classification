11,"ABSTRACT: A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has attracted global attention due to its highly infectious and pathogenic properties. Most of current studies focus on aerosols released from infected individuals, but the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater also should be examined. In this review, we used bibliometrics to statistically evaluate the importance of water-related issues in the context of COVID-19. The results show that the levels and transmission possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater are the main concerns, followed by potential secondary pollution by the intensive use of disinfectants, sludge disposal, and the personal safety of workers. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater requires more attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the most effective techniques, i.e., wastewater-based epidemiology and quantitative microbial risk assessment, for virus surveillance in wastewater are systematically analyzed. We further explicitly review and analyze the successful operation of a sewage treatment plant in Huoshenshan Hospital in China as an example and reference for other sewage treatment systems to properly ensure discharge safety and tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. This review offers deeper insight into the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 and similar viruses in the post-COVID19 era from a wastewater perspective.",1.0,coronavirus,True

This indicates that researchers have recognized the important roles of WBE in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in wastewater.

For the cities with superior water resources, often accompanied by high population densities, both water shortage and the possibility of viral transmission increase during the pandemic.12 More seriously, the regions with limited water resources may be troubled by more severe problems, including water pollution, poor sanitation, a lack of clean water, etc.30,31 The process of fetching water resources (such as the process of queuing or the contact of water containers) or washing with water resources that cannot meet the World Health Organization's sanitation standards will bring a greater risk of cross-infection.32,33 In addition, countries and regions with water scarcity are more likely to use wastewater for irrigation, which might increase the likelihood of accumulation of the virus in crops or soils.34,35 These potential risks in water",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

SARS-CoV-2 causes diarrhea and hampers the gastrointestinal function of humans.36 A large number of viruses in excreta may be discharged into the municipal sewage network and remain active in the sewage for a prolonged period of time, posing a risk of exposure to operators.37,38 During the COVIP-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials were widely detected in fecal wastewater.39-41 More precisely, septic tanks for wastewater (especially hospital wastewater) contain large amounts of fecal debris and suspended solids, which poses significant risks by releasing viruses from these organic solids.42 Considering the fact that 1.8 billion people worldwide still use cleaned fecalcontaminated water as drinking water, it is very important to take this transmission route into account.12,43",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
41,"Furthermore, it has been found that most fecally transmitted viruses are highly persistent in the aquatic environment. SARSCoV-2 is an enveloped virus and more likely to be inactivated than non-enveloped viruses.44-46 However, enveloped viruses have similar persistent rates compared to those of nonenveloped ones in dark water environments as determined by viral decay constants.47 Additionally, the persistence of SARSCoV-2 RNA is significantly longer than that of other closely related coronaviruses. For example, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is present in wastewater for 7 days, longer than human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E (2 days).47,48 The long persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in water leads to the nonneglectable significance of its potential transmission in water environments. Researchers have found that the time that SARS-CoV-2 persists is different in wastewater (>7 days) and groundwater (>10 weeks), indicating that SARS-CoV-2 is subject to environmental factors.49 Additionally, enveloped SARS-CoV-2 possibly has stronger mobility in the underground aquifer systems and viral adsorption on soil is crucially affected by pH, ion strength, and soil properties, posing challenges in virus detection and control.50 Consequently, the persistence, transmission, and risks of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater are affected by many factors, including viral load, viral activity, viral survival time, water type, and organic or microbial matter in water.44,51,52 Correspondingly, pertinent evaluation and detection methods should be adopted according to these real-world scenario, to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of water surveillance.53",1.0,coronavirus,True

In particular, the greatest risk arises in wastewater discharged from communities where COVID-19 patients, asymptomatic patients, and medical staff are concentrated.67,68 It is reported that the presence of coronaviruses in wastewater can be used to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the viral load in communities.24 To meet the needs of virus surveillance in wastewater, cost-effective and real-time monitoring protocols should be proposed. WBE, which can provide comprehensive assessments of the viral load in water environments, has been rapidly developed.64 In addition, as an optimized protocol for SARS-CoV-2 assessment, the quantitative microbial risk assessment is also limited for exploring a modeling-based approach.

53,"Waterborne viruses are the main cause of many diseases. They can be ingested through contaminated drinking water or food, inhaled through droplets or aerosols, or contagiously injested through contact mucosa or wounds, finally leading to infection. As the wastewater environment is reported to shield SARSCoV-2 over 7 days due to the rich organic matter,49 the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater or soil might pose remarkable risks to the surroundings. WBE is a method for analyzing the concentrations of target substances in the sewage of a specific area and then assessing its consumption within the region.69 It was first applied in the monitoring of illicit drugs since being introduced in 2001.70-72 Recently, researchers proposed WBE as a strong surveillance tool for monitoring waterborne viruses (such as osteomyelitis virus) and have achieved excellent performance.73",1.0,disease,True

56,"Recently, a WBE-based building sewage monitoring system was reported and successfully identified nine potential COVID-19 patients carrying SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong.78 During the entire wastewater monitoring process, they paid more attention to the sampling location, time, and frequency. First, the sampling point should be carefully chosen to locate the specific building clearly. Second, the sampling time is a key factor in WBE because appropriate sampling after discharge of feces can ensure a sufficient viral titer. Thus, the sampling time was 8:00 to 11:00 in the morning, and four samples were collected at hourly intervals. Subsequently, the 12 samples were mixed to be employed as a representative sample. Lastly, virus concentration and extraction are crucial to improve the accuracy of the results. In addition, the support and cooperation from government departments are significant to the success of WBE. As mentioned above, the application of WBE in Hong Kong successfully helped in the identification of COVID-19 patients and prevention of the spread of SARSCoV-2. This sewage monitoring system for buildings developed by the University of Hong Kong offered an excellent example to fight against COVID-19 with the aid of WBE and imply virus control in water environments. Accordingly, WBE is recommended as an initial warning tool, which can contribute to the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients and the measures for quick response strategies.46,83-85",1.0,COVID-19,True
57,"4.4.2. Effective Risk Assessment of QMRA. Microbial risk assessment is another method for risk analysis to protect public health. QMRA is a process for identifying and quantifying the adverse effects of exposure to certain microorganisms on human health by using the established scientific data and appropriate experimental methods, eventually providing a description of the risk characteristic.86 It mainly includes risk assessment, risk management, and risk information. On the basis of scientific evaluation, QMRA carries out hazard identification, hazard characterization, exposure assessment, and risk characterization.87 QMRA is a valuable tool for supporting water safety plans and could be used to assess human health risks associated with exposure to pathogens in different environmental matrices.88,89 Therefore, QMRA is suitable for addressing the following questions raised by the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) to identify the risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in different wastewaters by determining the diffusion mode and volatilization rate, (2) to determine the safe distance and areas regarding the outbreak of COVID-19, and (3) to evaluate the disinfection technology for inactivating SARS-CoV-2. Recently, QMRA in empirical mode has been proposed for virus assessment of virus, aiming at sewage from different sources,25,90,91 because QMRA can develop a scalable model for interpreting case reporting data and predicting the risk of spread of viruses.

Some experts have alleged that herd immunity to COVID-19 is probably impossible.98 Accordingly, before herd immunity can be achieved, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in water environments is significant in preventing the wide outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. WBE can be employed to monitor the spasmodic infection cases in real time.

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, China took timely and effective measures to prevent and control the initial spread in Wuhan.12,109-111 Two specialized emergency hospitals for COVID-19 patients were established in China (Leishenshan Hospital and Huoshenshan Hospital) and received more than 5000 COVID-19 patients. Strict treatment measures were employed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spillover or spread into the surrounding environment, including wastewater treatment processes. As the two hospitals have the same design capacity of the sewage treatment plant, the design and operation of the facilities for wastewater treatment in Huoshenshan Hospital are representative and described in detail to provide an example and reference for other operational problems of medical wastewater, which is also of great significance for the protection of public health.112",1.0,COVID-19,True

Subsequently, the wastewater is treated in the moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBR), which is designed in parallel with an HRT of 5.6 h. Sludge from MBBR is separated in the coagulation and sedimentation tanks, stored in the auxiliary sludge concentration tank, and then treated in the sludge thickener. A sodium hypochlorite solution is added to the sludge thickener by the metering pump for the sludge deactivation. After gravity concentration in a concentration tank, the supernatant is discharged back into the regulating reservoir. The concentrated sludge is transferred into the spiral dewatering machine by the sludge screw pump.

Accordingly, the waste gas requires a careful treatment for avoiding potential risks to the medical staffs and secondary air pollution in the surrounding area. The waste gas from the sewage treatment sector is discharged after the combination of activated carbon adsorption and UV photolysis oxidation. The waste gas from medical waste incineration is first cooled and then treated by desulfurization and deacidification. Afterward, the waste gas is collected using a polyether (PE) microporous dust collector and finally adsorbed by activated carbon.
