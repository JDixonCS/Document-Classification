19,INTRODUCTION,0.0,,False
20,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social communication deficits, restricted interests, repetitive behaviors, and with an estimated global prevalence of 1% (APA 2013). It is a complex condition that significantly affects everyday life as well as the quality of life of the patient himself and that of his/her caregiver. Symptomatology that is often a presentation of comorbid state is very often misunderstood in everyday clinical practice as part of ASD clinical presentation. Individuals with ASD commonly experience significantly higher prevalence of other mental disorders compared to typically developed individuals (Romero et al. 2016). These comorbidities often exacerbate their need for overall support. It is generally considered that persons with comorbidity will have more severe impairments as a result of having more than one disorder (De Filippis 2018). It is estimated that nearly 70% of people diagnosed with ASD have at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder, and approximately 40% of them may have two or more",1.0,social,True
21,"comorbid psychiatric disorders (Hossain et al. 2020). Common comorbidities in individuals with ASD are Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), mood alterations, sleeping and eating problems, mental retardation, behavioral problems, anxiety disorders, etc. (Lai et al. 2019). ASD continues to remain underdiagnosed in many countries (Elsabbagh et al. 2012). Serbia still does not have a national register of people with ASD8VLQJWKHVRFDOOHG³SURWHFWLYHGLDJQRVLV´LV common, avoiding the real, lifetime diagnosis of ASD. 0RUHRYHU ³JROG VWDQGDUG´ GLDJQRVWLF DVVHVVPHQW instruments, are rarely used, resulting in an inaccurate estimate of people diagnosed with ASD, which also includes the comorbid conditions (Lakic 2012, Stupar et al. 2015). The lack of exact diagnostic assessment hinders proper treatment, support, and total functioning improvement (Nik Adib et al. 2019).

250,"The presumption of our study was that altered living conditions and daily functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic could have a particular impact on the ASD and ADS+ populations.

251,"The results of our study show that in both groups, ASD and ASD+, there was a worsening of both autism symptoms and general behavioral problems. This result is consistent with the findings of other researchers who have dealt with behavioral changes in children with ASD during altered pandemic conditions, even with very similar results (Patel et al. 2020).",1.0,pandemic,True
252,"Our results also reveal that in both groups there was deterioration in repetitive behavior patterns (as much as 39.5%), acquired skills of daily self-care, social interaction and sensory problems, with additional difficulties in education. A natural course of social communication problems and sensory problems in people with ASD, has either improvement, or the condition has remained unchanged over the years (Hasen et al. 2014, Mazurek et al. 2012). Our findings of deterioration could represents a significant change and confirms the potential negative impact of the emerging pandemic conditions on this population. Also, our findings are consistent with a similar study, during the COVID-19 pandemic, where it was found that in their examined population of parents of children with ASD there was a worsening of problematic behavior patterns, problems with aggression, self-harm and sensory problems (Mutluer et al. 2020). In addition, participating caregivers report deterioration in social communication, increased stereotypes, sensory hypersensitivity and aggression during the COVID-19 pandemic (Mutluer et al. 2020). Research on this topic by other authors also reveals much more intense (in 35.5% of respondents) and much more frequent (in 41.5% of respondents) behavioral problems in the population with ASD whose parents participated in this study, compared to the period before the pandemic (Colizzi et al. 2020). Lifestyle changes during a pandemic can also be classified as a potentially traumatic experience, especially given that individual reactions of people with ASD to altered pandemic conditions are similar to symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Peterson et al. 2019). This view is based on the study of specific symptoms of PTSD in people with ASD (aggressive behavior, self-harm, sleep and concentration problems, common in people with ASD after trauma) (Storch et al. 2013). It can be observed that the main finding of PTSD symptoms in children with ASD, namely,",1.0,social,True

Therefore, it is important to keep in mind that the current, prolonged pandemic situation can cause such symptoms, and professionals who deal with the mental health of this population should notice the appearance of these symptoms on time, or their worsening, for a prompt therapeutic response (Narzisi 2020).",1.0,social,True
254,"The results show that the worsening of ASD symptoms and behavioral problems has occurred during the pandemic, however, the difference between the groups was not significant. This may indicate that the primary disorder (ASD) presents a major risk for symptom exacerbation of this vulnerable group rather than its comorbidities. Namely, prolonged time of confinement in the house and changes in daily routines with insufficient understanding of the resulting changes can affect these deteriorations. However, perhaps the factor that has the greatest impact on such worsening of symptoms and overall functioning is the lack of previous help from experts dealing with this population and changes in the school system (online teaching, termination of schooling and direct participation in previous school routines, which also affects the structure of daily functioning 2¶6XOOLYDQ HW DO  :H EHOLHYH WKDW WKLV IDFWRU should be especially considered in relation to planning future support for this population in the changed general conditions of functioning.
