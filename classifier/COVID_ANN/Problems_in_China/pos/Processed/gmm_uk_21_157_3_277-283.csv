6,"Introduction: Currently, the face mask represents an incomparable symbol whose value went from clinical work to impacting the containment of the spread of SARS-CoV-2, although it has become an element of discord in the general population. ­Objective: To establish the impact of face mask use policies on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Methods: Face mask use policy variables, obtained from the website of the #Masks4All scientific movement, were associated with the number of infections, deaths and flattening of the curve published by the Johns Hopkins University resource center and EndCoronavirus.org. Results: Face mask use policies were universal (required in shops, restaurants, public transport), partial (recommended, required in any public place) and absent. Associations of the face mask use policy with total cases (p ,"" 0.01), cases per million (p "", 0.04) and deaths per million population (p , 0.02) were statistically significant. Associations of the variables with the epidemiological curve trend were also statistically significant (p , 0.00). Conclusion: The recommendation for face mask widespread use is a measure with sufficient scientific support to reduce the number of COVID-19-related infections and deaths.",1.0,mask,True

25,"Stanley Ipkiss (""The Mask""): ""It's a power tie... It is supposed to make you feel powerful"". This cinematographic dialogue perfectly suits the prominence of face masks during current pandemic, which have become a synonym of authority, a valuable possession.1 The psychological symbolism of the mask is explained by the use of facial expressions to construct ideas about feelings and desires, and thus, the distortion caused by the mask favors an individual response that works in two forms: one that is controlled and another that is implicit.2",1.0,Mask,True
26,"The use of face mask in the clinical field dates back to 1700, with the miasmatic theory, which popularized the famous ""plague doctor"" or beak-shaped masks, described by Charles de Lorme.1 In one chapter of his operating theory, Martin Kirschner (18791942) referred to face masks as ""measures to fight infections"". In the 1920s, face masks were used for the first time in the surgical field in Germany and the United States.3",1.0,mask,True
27,"The use of protective equipment against respiratory infections within the clinical setting has no questioning regarding its usefulness.4,5 This has allowed this measure to be transferred to the general population, with a beneficial impact,5 which is why even face masks manufactured with rudimentary materials are considered a better alternative to an absence of protection.5,6 The most common face masks in the general population are made with surgical material with less filtration, as well as with daily use garments fabric,7,8 with filtration variations ranging from 9 to 98 %,7 which decreases with reuse and washing cycles.8",1.0,protective,True
28,"At the beginning of current pandemic, the general recommendation regarding the use of face masks was to ration them for use in the medical field, since it was considered that the evidence did not provide conclusive information for indicating widespread use;9 however, concerns of the scientific community generated a debate that led to the dissemination of multiple publications that supported its usefulness.10,11 After weighing the scientific data, the World Health Organization updated the standard for widespread use.12 A systematic review and meta-analysis published by The Lancet in June 2020 was the final endorsement in favor of the indication.13 Despite the above, not all countries considered making this measure a mandatory element for their citizens.",1.0,pandemic,True

Sociodemographic, geographic and environmental characteristics, as well as those diseases that are characteristic of each region, are going to be a determining element for these estimations.23 Although the policy on the use of face masks will not have all the weight in this impact, the fact that reducing the speed of transmission can optimize available resources for patient care cannot be overlooked; that was the lesson learned from the spread of COVID-19 through Asia and Europe.32,33 Finally, it should be borne in mind that, so far, there is no specific treatment for this disease, a fact that makes it essential for a model focused on prevention to be proposed.34",1.0,pandemic,True
