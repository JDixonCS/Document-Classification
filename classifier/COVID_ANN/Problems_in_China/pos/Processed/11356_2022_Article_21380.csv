5,"Abstract Numerous studies have been conducted to identify the effects of natural crises on supply chain performance. Conventional analysis methods are based on either manual filter methods or data-driven methods. The manual filter methods suffer from validation problems due to sampling limitations, and data-driven methods suffer from the nature of crisis data which are vague and complex. This study aims to present an intelligent analysis model to automatically identify the effects of natural crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic on the supply chain through metadata generated on social media. This paper presents a thematic analysis framework to extract knowledge under user steering. This framework uses a text-mining approach, including co-occurrence term analysis and knowledge map construction. As a case study to approve our proposed model, we retrieved, cleaned, and analyzed 1024 online textual reports on supply chain crises published during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019-2021. We conducted a thematic analysis of the collected data and achieved a knowledge map on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the supply chain. The resultant knowledge map consists of five main areas (and related sub-areas), including (1) food retail, (2) food services, (3) manufacturing, (4) consumers, and (5) logistics. We checked and validated the analytical results with some field experts. This experiment achieved 53 crisis knowledge propositions classified from 25,272 sentences with 631,799 terms and 31,864 unique terms using just three user-system interaction steps, which shows the model's high performance. The results lead us to conclude that the proposed model could be used effectively and efficiently as a decision support system, especially for crises in the supply chain analysis.",1.0,COVID-19,True

The extracted KUs are shown in the evaluated output in the figure. According to the KUs extracted based on a query, it is clear that the rapid spread of COVID-19 and its impact has led to an increase in food health-conscious behavior.

For this purpose, 975 online analytical reports on related topics were gathered and cleaned as a corpus. Then, data pre-processing operations were performed to prepare the data for further processing. And finally, using topic modeling, term frequency, and co-occurrence analysis, a set of analytical reports related to the effects of natural crises on the SC was analyzed. By textual analysis, 53 crisis knowledge propositions were extracted from 25,272 sentences in the corpus.

717,"This paper addresses two main research gaps. First, much research has been done to identify SC crises based on qualitative methods. These methods, in addition to sample limitations, are subject to human biases and judgments that cause results to be questionable. For example, survey data in research by Giannakis et al. (2016), based on human judgments, raise concerns about possible biases. Second, datadriven research has been conducted by analyzing large volumes of data to minimize the problem of data limitations and human judgments. These methods analyze the data using conventional text analysis methods, regardless of the nature of the risk (Wang and Ye 2018; Kara et al. 2020; Ganesh and Kalpana 2022). Risk data are ambiguous, complex, and have multiple meanings; thus, one risk term may fall into different sectors (Pai et al. 2003; Chiu and Choi 2016). Mere text analysis methods cannot make this distinction and require human steering (Jin et al. 2018; Chu et al. 2020).",1.0,,True

723,"SC crisis monitoring framework could be useful for both firms and governments. The firms could use this framework for their business continuity, and governments could use it for their effective policymaking (O'Rourke 2014). The current literature shows how specific decision-making processes before, during, and after a crisis can improve a company's SC performance (Dayton and Bernhardsdottir 2010). The development of information networks has enabled companies to access and analyze crisis information transparently. Companies can make decisions and take action using crisis data analysis instead of evidence-based speculation (Jin et al. 2018; McAfee et al. 2012). Data analysis is used for various operations such as procurement, service, production, warehousing, and demand management in SC management. For instance, Nguyen et al. discussed using metadata in SC management (Nguyen et al. 2015).",0.0,,False

Second, the subject was limited to social media reports for analysis in the data collection phase. This is just for the purpose of representing the operation of the proposed framework. Various automation systems such as enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management in companies collect very important applicable data related to financials, SC, operations, commerce, reporting, manufacturing, and human resource activities that should be considered in the analysis.",1.0,social,True
732,"Hence, future developments of this research could focus on two aspects. First, it could focus on the analysis of dependencies among various crisis factors. Understanding the relationship between different types of crises significantly improves supply chain crisis classification and management.

Secondly, for crisis analysis of various crisis data types such as automation systems, the future extension could focus on creating data analysis rules, identifying thresholds, and mapping the results to identify crisis factors in the supply chain.",1.0,,True
