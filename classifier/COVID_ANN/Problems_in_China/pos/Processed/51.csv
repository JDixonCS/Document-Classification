7,"Introduction: The Covid 19 pandemic was first officially noted in China in late 2019. After that, the virus spread globally. At that time it was a new virus and we did know nothing about the virus. So lock down or home confinement was the only option to control the spread of the virus (1). During that time children suffered the most as they were confined at home (2). During this period they showed various behavioural problems and when restrictions were withdrawn they still showed some behavioural issues.",1.0,pandemic,True
8,Methodology: We conducted a cross-sectional study using an English questionnaire. The questionnaire was validated by five independent psychiatrists who were finally excluded from the study. Responses from the parents of randomly selected 76 children were recorded. We included the children aged between 3 to 12 years and who previously used to go to school.,0.0,,False
9,"Results: 40.8 % of children were of 6 to 10 years of age and the male and females were almost equal in number in our study (M: F ,"" 40:36).

In most of the cases ( 61.8%) father is the only earning member followed by both parents working (34.2%) and in only 3.9% of cases, the mother is the only earning member of the family. About 76.3% of parents observed behavioural issues in their children. The problems were mostly observed in 6 to 10 yrs of age. Males showed the problem most often than females ( M:F "", 33:25). Children from urban areas showed behavioural problems more often.",1.0,case,True
10,"Discussion: Most of the parents reported that their children were having different sorts of problems during this period(3). The families of small children aged 6 to 10 yrs of age were facing various problems more often. The children of this age group showed problems more often as they were isolated at home.
