Under the external shocks to GICs, such as US trade frictions with China and the COVID-19 pandemic, China's traditional comparative advantages in manufacturing which include its labor force and costs are waning. This has manifested in a wave of industrial relocations from China to other countries as well as China's weakening international competitiveness. We took stock of the concepts and journey of GVCs and elaborated the intrinsic relationship between GVCs and the new development pattern of ""dual circulations"". We also analyzed the trends of GVCs, the current status and problems of China's industrial chains, and China's market heft, complete industrial chains and the digital economy as new strengths for industrial chain upgrade. In our conclusion, this paper put forth some policy recommendations for China's industrial chain upgrade in the context of dual circulations.",1.0,COVID-19,True

9,"Global value chains (GVCs) are a natural trend of the global division of labor and a result of the global allocation of resources by multinational corporations. Historically, global supply chains centered around Europe and North America as manufacturing hubs before evolving into a global supply chain system with Europe, North America, Germany and Japan at the first echelon and the Four Asian Tigers at the second echelon. Since the dawn of the 21st century, China has climbed up the GVC ladder and replaced Japan as Asia's trade hub. The United States, China and Germany have become three regional hubs of the GICs system. After nearly three decades of development, GVCs are faced with multifaceted challenges under the superimposed effects of China-US trade frictions and the COVID-19 pandemic. The fragility of modern supply chains is particularly evident in the context of changes in the world today unseen over the past century and exacerbated by COVID-19.

In this context, the CPC Central Committee has made an important, science-based assessment and strategic choice to ""create a new development pattern with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other"".1 Under the new development pattern, the coordination, efficiency and security of domestic and international value chains are China's top priority. Based on this analysis, this paper reviews relevant concepts and theories of GVCs, examines the trends of GVCs, and offers some policy recommendations on China's industrial competitiveness and industrial chain upgrade based on supply chain strengths in the context of the ""dual circulations"".",1.0,trial,True

25,"2.1 Concepts of Industrial, Supply and Value Chains The idea of industrial chains originated from British classical economist Adam Smith's discussions",1.0,trial,True
26,"on the division of labor. Early Western economists believed that industrial chains were primarily driven by internal activities within individual manufacturing companies. With the expansion of capitalist production, Alfred Marshall (1962), the founder of the neoclassical school of economics, extended the division of labor to one between firms, laying the foundation for the modern industrial chain theory (Marshall, 1962). Although the concept of industrial chains originates from Western neoclassical economic theories, Western academics have yet to systematically investigate industrial chains as an independent tier of economic organization (Zhang and Wu, 2011). Instead, they focus their researches on the manifestations of industrial chains (Shao and Li, 2007; Cheng, et al., 2008).",1.0,trial,True
27,"Overall, two intrinsic characteristics can be found in the definitions of industrial, value and supply chains: (i) The division of labor in production. From the perspective of economics, the division of labor is an intrinsic attribute of industrial, value and supply chains. The idea of industrial chains stems from British classical economist Adam Smith's statement on the division of labor and its economic growth effects. Baldwin (2013) believed that the division of labor in production had undergone two critical rounds of unbundling, i.e. the first round of division of labor that started with the Industrial Revolution driven by steam engines and the second round of division of labor driven by progress in information and communication technologies (ICTs). Each division has led to a further geographical diffusion of production. (ii) Production cycle. Industrial, value and supply chains are manifestations of economic circulation on the supply side. Industrial chains, value chains or supply chains embody a chain or network structure of R&D design, processing and manufacturing, and marketing. They comprise a production cycle and are the manifestations of economic circulation on the supply side. When such production cycle is confined to a country or region, a domestic value chain is formed and constitutes the bulk of a domestic circulation. When it is extended to the international division of labor, an international value chain comes into existence and becomes the core of an international circulation. In this sense, a ""dual circulations"" development pattern is manifested as GVCs on the supply side.",1.0,trial,True
28,"Yet, differences exist in the definitions of industrial, value and supply chains. The first difference is between materials and value. Supply chains provide goods and services and reflect the supply, demand and distribution of materials. Supply chain management aims to match supply with demand at the lowest cost and with the highest efficiency. Value chains transmit the value embodied in products or services and reflect value creation and profit distribution. The second difference is between macro and",1.0,trial,True

While supply chains have more to do with the management and decisionmaking at the firm level, government authorities make policies based on broader considerations of industrial and value chains. Moreover, industrial chains are the material basis of value chains and the vehicle for value realization as well as value addition.

Countries specialize in various production processes and intermediate inputs, such as parts and components, under a global production network.

Instances of trade in intermediate inputs are common in our economic life. Xing and Detert (2010) discovered from an anatomy of iPhone's value chain that value addition from assembly and processing in China accounted for less than 3.60 US dollars (3.60%) from each 100 US dollars' worth of an iPhone while the majority share of value addition was captured by Germany, Japan and the US.

The United States also launched attacks on China's high-tech industrial chains. In March 2016 and April 2018, the United States issued injunctions prohibiting US high-tech firms from supplying components, software, equipment and other technological products to ZTE, a Chinese telecom manufacturer. These attacks not only stifled ZTE but weakened China's telecom industry chain. Since then, the United States has also put Huawei, a telecommunications equipment company, on its trade blacklist, prohibiting global suppliers with US technology from shipping goods to Huawei.

Since joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, China has adjusted its policies to come to terms with international trade rules. By broadening openness, scaling down the negative list, and offering a conducive business climate, China has emerged as an attractive destination for multinational firms to set up factories and R&D centers, becoming the world's factory floor. China became the world's largest goods exporting nation in 2009 and the world's largest manufacturing nation in 2010. By the end of 2019, China's manufacturing value-added reached 3,901.96 billion US dollars, accounting for 27.20% of China's GDP. Since the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, China has contributed more than 30% of world economic growth and integrated into core processes of GVCs as a key participant.",1.0,negative,True
347,"5.1 Large Industrial Volumes and Complete Industrial Chains In embedding into value chains, China's manufacturing industry has ascended the GVC ladder and",1.0,trial,True
348,"formed incomparable industrial chains. After years of independent development, China has formed the longest, largest and relatively complete industrial chains. According to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, China is the only country with all manufacturing sectors and ranks high in the world in terms of the value-added of 22 manufacturing sectors. China ranks the first in terms of output of 230 out of 500 types of major industrial goods in the world. A complete modern industrial system ensures China's economic resiliency, allowing China to effectively maintain industrial and supply chain stability despite external shocks beyond its control.",1.0,trial,True
349,"5.2 New Comparative Advantages Are Taking Shape China's traditional advantages for resource endowment, such as labor cost and demographic",1.0,,True
350,"dividends, have diminished in recent years. However, China's new comparative advantages are emerging. In terms of production inputs, China's cost advantage for primary production factors, especially cheap labor, is giving way to strengths in advanced production factors such as digital technology. In the decade following the global financial crisis of 2008, China's manufacturing compensation per worker rose from 4,915 US dollars in 2009 to 9,061 US dollars in 2018. This 7% annual average growth rate exceeded not only the world average by close to six percentage points, but the growth rates of India, Indonesia and Mexico. As mentioned before, China has the second largest digital economy in the world. By integrating with the real economy, the digital economy will undoubtedly become a new cornerstone for China's manufacturing competitiveness.",1.0,,True
351,"In terms of technological innovations, China's exogenous innovation dividend based on technology transfer from the developed world is giving way to endogenous innovation supported by a large domestic economy. Since reform and opening up was launched in 1978, China has established a relatively complete innovation system through industrial transfer, technology importation, assimilation, integrated innovation, and strategic emulation. The problem is that multinational firms tend to retain core technologies in their home soil and transfer mature technologies to host countries. Their R&D in host countries is focused on adaptations to the local market needs. The dividends of such technology transfer have been more or less exhausted. China's large and multitiered market offers a broad and inclusive environment for businesses to thrive, giving rise to endogenous innovation led by independent, coordinated and integrated innovations.",1.0,trial,True

A new round of great transformations is sweeping across the world today. Amid in-depth adjustments in the international economic and political order, uncertainties and instabilities are on the rise.",1.0,trial,True
363,"In addition, China already has the basic conditions for domestic economic circulation. It has a large and diverse domestic consumer market and the world's largest middle-income group. Yet, the supply side of China's consumer market lacks sophistication compared with the international consumer market. Domestic demand for mid- and high-end goods and services has yet to be effectively satisfied by domestic supplies. China should propel household consumption upgrade from the supply side, increase the effective supply of goods and services in its mid- and high-end and emerging consumer markets, and vigorously introduce high-quality goods and services from the international market (Ni and Ji, 2020). From a supply-side perspective, China boasts the largest and most complete industrial system, and the economic foundation for the domestic circulation to play a dominant role.

365,"With its shocks to the world economy, the COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed GVC restructuring. China's success in pandemic control and economic recovery have won a window period to take an initiative in GVC restructuring. To some extent, the pandemic has slowed the migration of China's labor-intensive manufacturing to Southeast Asia. Amid rising factor cost and trade protectionism, China's industrial and supply chains have started to relocate elsewhere. The pandemic alarmed the developed world of the importance of supply chain security. Countries have vowed to re-shore strategic industries such as medical supplies and critical materials and localize the manufacturing of critical products. Yet those attempts to re-shore supply chains have been marred by the pandemic, thus delaying manufacturing relocation from China. This creates a rare window period for China to stabilize and upgrade its manufacturing industrial chains.

China's supply chain stability has become a key attraction to global capital backflows. Following this trend, China should enhance capabilities for central and western regions to serve as destinations for industrial relocation, create a group of world-class industrial zones, and combine the central and western regions' factor strengths, such as raw materials, land and energy, with the eastern region's strengths in capital and technology. The goal is to establish a domestic division of labor system with reasonable echelons, close ties and efficient coordination. While stabilizing domestic industrial chains, China should strive to bring industries back home, optimize industrial layout, and establish high-quality modern industrial clusters. China should stabilize manufacturing supply chains and prevent manufacturing relocation, focusing on key enterprises and processes of GICs. Firstly, we should establish core industrial zones led by key enterprises and encourage them to set up regional headquarters, R&D centers, and settlement centers. Secondly, we should step up business promotion, strengthen supply chains, develop industrial ecosystems, and foster ""implicit champions"" and ""niche champions"" that lead global or nationwide markets.

In addition, China should localize and diversify its supply chains. A national supply chain strategy and supply chain local substitution initiative should be implemented. In critical areas, upstream and downstream enterprises of domestic industrial chains should work together to create independent, secure and reliable domestic supply chain systems. China should strive to substitute high-value imported commodities with domestic replacements via R&D and product upgrades.

390,"Secondly, China should speed up the development of new special economic zones in the central and western regions. Unlike the balanced approach of establishing one national strategic economic zone in one province, we should create a group of new special economic zones in regional central cities of the central and western regions. In those special zones, we should implement integrated reform and policy measures, tolerate trials and errors, and offer more preferential policy incentives, tax breaks and customs arrangements referencing the policy practices of Southeast Asian countries for serving as destinations for industrial relocation. The special economic zones should be encouraged to attract populations and technologies and increase industrial capacity.",1.0,trial,True

China should set up a steering group for industrial relocation to China's central and western regions responsible for the policy-making, planning and supervision of industrial relocation. China should formulate a plan for industrial relocation to central and western regions and identify priorities to avoid disorderly competition and repetitive development. The central and western regions should host a group of world-class industrial projects to facilitate industrial clustering. A special fund of industrial relocation should be established to support local governments or enterprises to relocate industries. Provinces in central and western regions should be paired with tier-one cities in the eastern region, so that cities with GDP above 1 trillion yuan in China's eastern coastal region will assist sister central cities in the central and western regions.
