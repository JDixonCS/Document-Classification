6,"The novel coronavirus COVID-19 was initially found in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since then, the COVID-19 virus has rapidly spread throughout the world, causing the collapse of medical systems and economic depression. In addition to providing various relief programs, many countries have implemented various anti-epidemic measures to stop the continuous deterioration of the epidemic and maintain the stability of their economies. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency decision making and risk assessment is an important issue for guaranteeing the stable life of the people are considered emergency multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problems. The assessment information of the criteria simultaneously includes complete, incomplete and hesitant fuzzy linguistic information in emergency MCDM problems. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach can effectively process MCDM problems; however, the traditional AHP approach cannot handle the incomplete and hesitant fuzzy linguistic information of emergency MCDM problems. In order to overcome these issues, this paper proposed a novel flexible AHP method to solve emergency MCDM problems under the COVID-19 pandemic, and adopted a numerical case about public health emergency decision making and risk assessment under the COVID-19 pandemic to verify the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed flexible AHP method.",1.0,coronavirus,True

8,"Since late December 2019, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered, the COVID-19 coronavirus has rapidly spread throughout the world. On January 10, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined the new coronavirus as COVID-19, with `CO' meaning corona, `VI' meaning virus, `D' meaning disease, and `19' meaning the year it was discovered (Chen et al. 2021). The COVID-19 coronavirus spreads among people with frightening speed, posing a serious threat to life and causing a global pandemic (Hong et al. 2020). As of September 2021, 230 million people worldwide have been infected with COVID-19, and 4.77 million of them have died (WHO publication, 2021). In order to effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19, many scholars in various fields have conducted analysis and research on the epidemic situations related to COVID-19. For example, Chen et al. (2020) used news reports of COVID-19 as a simulation example and applied big textual data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the machine optimization process. The improved data analysis of Chen et al.'s (2020) method can remove functional and meaningless words quickly through machine processing and provide corpus data for decision makers in specific fields for further use. Wang et al. (2021) used the AHP method, brainstorming and literature research to establish a risk evaluation model for COVID-19 infection and provide management strategies to reduce COVID-19 infections. COVID-19 is no longer limited to medical issues, and various fields have taken great efforts to handle issues that are related to COVID-19, such as emergency logistics systems, supply chain risk management, travel, and tourism industry issues, medical issues, waste management, and so on (e.g., Baryannis et al. 2019; Bazan et al. 2021; Jiang et al. 2020; Skare et al. 2021; Van Fan et al. 2021).

10,"various fields, as well as effectively integrate, allocate, and utilize existing medical resources, are truly complex and difficult issues which can be categorized as emergency multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problems. On the other hand, due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, the collection of emergency data is an enormous challenge due to the lack of sufficient information about the disease and statistics on the number of infected people and medical resources, etc. There are many unknown, partially known, missing, or non-existent data in the process of collecting information, which leads to increased uncertainty and complexity in emergency support decision-making.",1.0,spread,True
11,"Saaty (1980) developed a mathematical tool composed of a hierarchical structure called the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, which based on the judgment of knowledgeable experts to conduct pairwise comparison for each criterion, rank criteria and evaluate alternatives from the total weighted score to obtain the solution characteristics of multi-level and hierarchical structures and to systematically solve problems that contain qualitative and quantitative elements. The AHP method is considered an effective approach for handling complex decisions and can help decision makers prioritize various attributes and make correct decisions. For example, Das et al. (2021) combined the decision-making experiment and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and AHP methods to evaluate the factors affecting supply chain networks under the environment of COVID-19. The results showed that the most important element is the optimization of cost. This research finding could help policy makers improve their operational capabilities and performance by developing a risk-resilient supply chain framework, as well as effectively eliminate the problems plaguing the supply chain during the epidemic. Hussain et al. (2021) used the AHP method to deal with group decision-making problems during the COVID-19 pandemic and emphasized energy management performance as a critical issue. The results showed that government measures and personal factors are the biggest influencing factors. The survey results also provided insights for government agencies as a reference for prioritizing workforce health and safety. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ortiz-Barrios et al. (2021) combined the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and AHP methods to improve the preparation level of sales departments and applied it to the electrical appliance sector. The results showed that this is a flexible methodology that can identify weaknesses that should be resolved to improve effectiveness under current market conditions. The AHP method has also been used extensively in other applications, such as driver safety (Moslem et al. 2020), group decision making (Lin et al. 2020), risk management (Lyu et al. 2020), supplier selection (Chang et al. 2016), and so on.",1.0,COVID-19,True
12,"In general, decision makers may not have sufficient confidence in their preferences, leading to an increased degree of uncertainty associated with their decisions. People also often make many ambiguous answers due to incomplete information. In order to represent uncertain evaluation information clearly, Zadeh (1965) presented the fuzzy set theory to solve these situations. However, human cognition not only has fuzzy uncertainty but may also contain hesitation uncertainty. Rodriguez et al. (2012) proposed the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS), which uses different terms to estimate a linguistic variable instead of a single term to solve the hesitant information of experts. Later, Liao et al. (2015) redefined HFLTS in mathematics and introduced elements of hesitation and fuzzy linguistic. In addition, numerous other researchers have used HFLTS to deal with MCDM problems. For example,",1.0,,True

14,"Samanlioglu and Kaya (2020) used country-level intervention strategies for COVID-19 to make pairwise comparisons using the hesitant fuzzy AHP method, determine the relative importance scores between intervention strategies, and assess the importance of alternative intervention strategies. The result showed that their method can provide flexibility in decision making for decision makers (policymakers, governors, and physicians). Sir and Sir (2021) combined the Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method and the hesitant AHP method to determine the ranking of various alternatives for the treatment of pain, so as to select the best alternative to alleviate the pain of COVID-19 patients. According to the results, paracetamol and interventional therapy are the first two preferred treatment options, which implied that high accurate methods are used to eliminate errors that caused by experts' subjective evaluation during the pain treatment process. HFLTS can deal with hesitant linguistic information effectively; therefore, it has been applied in various researches by many scholars, such as supplier selection (Chang 2015), strategic management (Liao et al. 2020), investments (Liao et al. 2019), and so on.",1.0,COVID-19,True
15,"To carry out uncertainties or nonexistent information that traditional method can not to handle, Molodtsov (1999) initialed the soft set, which was a new concept of generic mathematical tool that could be used to deal with undefined or uncertain objects and reduce bias in the process of solving decisionmaking problems. Today, it can be seen that this mathematical model continues to be developed with each passing day, and it has been successfully applied to several areas, such as operational research, game theory, and probability (Baskaran and Eswari 2021). In addition, many researchers have used soft sets to deal with different decision-making problems, such as supplier selection (Chang 2015), cloud datacenter selection strategies (Baskaran and Eswari 2021), decision making (Dalkilic 2021), COVID-19 vaccine preferences (Narayanamoorthy et al. 2021), and other various fields.",1.0,area,True

There are many claims about the origin of COVID-19, including that it was caused by the consumption of wild animals. When investigating the initial COVID-19 infectious disease case, scientists discovered that many patients had been to a wholesale seafood market in Huanan, where many carcasses of wild animals were sold (Singhal 2020; Yuan et al. 2020).

At present, the number of patients infected with COVID-19 is still continuously increasing. Based on the above situation, the novel coronavirus is severely and continuously affecting global political and economic systems. Many countries hope to control the COVID-19 epidemic effectively by adopting the method of blocking cities and closing borders, resulting in the cancellation of a large number of flights and travel itineraries and having a huge impact on aviation, transportation, tourism, and other industries. Most countries have banned public gatherings, suspended classes (moving to at-home classes or online learning), prohibiting eating out, forced people to wear masks, and required companies to allow their employees to work at home to reduce gatherings. This has caused a change in lifestyle and increased the use of cloud operations. Many companies have also stopped production lines while for the epidemic to ease.

588,"The typical AHP method can only handle exact information, moreover, the hesitant AHP method addressed only hesitant fuzzy information. If the experts provided information containing partially nonexistent information, the typical AHP method and hesitant AHP method would dismiss some available information, causing bias in the decision procedure. The proposed method was verified by numerical examples and found to be useful when encounter information containing unknown, partially known, missing, or non-existent information during the collection of COVID-19 data. The advantages of the proposed method are presented below.",1.0,COVID-19,True
589,"First, when collecting information to solve group MCDM problems, experts in various fields such as economics, medicine, and public health may be unfamiliar or unaware of certain professional knowledge and be unable to answer certain questions, causing certain information to be unavailable. Traditionally, due to research method limitations, the typical AHP method and hesitant AHP method have been unable to handle partially nonexistent information; therefore, the typical AHP method and hesitant AHP method will often neglect important information. In order to deal with incomplete information, this study used the concept of the soft set to deal with this situation and retain crucial questionnaire information. The proposed method could calculate all possible selection values for each object and supplement missing information by means of numerical averaging to overcome the aforementioned problem of partially nonexistent information. Therefore, all the questionnaire information could be presented authentically, considered fully, and applied widely.",1.0,,True
590,"Second, in practice, the typical AHP method can only handle exact values; when encountering hesitant fuzzy information, the available information will be ambiguous. Therefore, questionnaires containing hesitant fuzzy information will be considered invalid and deleted, causing valuable information to go missing and easily resulting in biased assessment results. The hesitant AHP method and the proposed flexible AHP method can deal with hesitant fuzzy information by applying a defuzzification method to determine the interval value of the evaluation data set and replacing this information with the mean value.

593,"Third, based on Table 4, it contained hesitant fuzzy information (Expert 3 and 4) and partially nonexistent information (Expert 5). Due to the hesitant AHP method being unable to handle partially nonexistent information, as shown in Table 13, the calculation result of the hesitant AHP method indicated that A4 (0.572) was ranked fifth and that A5 (0.573) was ranked fourth. The closeness of these values could cause errors in ranking. However, because of the proposed flexible AHP method being able to deal with unknown, partly-known, missing, inexistent, or hesitant fuzzy linguistic data, it could fully consider the available information and distinguish small numerical differences. The calculation result showed that A4 (0.576) was ranked fourth and A5 (0.574) was ranked fifth, which was the correct ranking.

613,"The outbreak and rapid spread of COVID-19 since December 2019 have severely affected the world's economic development and people's lives and survival. From the past experience of epidemic prevention in various countries, it can be understood that if correct epidemic prevention measures and medical planning are adopted in the early stage of an epidemic, the severity of the epidemic can be greatly reduced. How to properly allocate medical resources is a crucial issue for emergency MCDM problems related to COVID-19. Emergency MCDM problems involve many levels and factors and usually contain both qualitative and quantitative information and factors. Moreover, when giving assessment criteria scores for emergency MCDM problems, the experts may encounter problems due to time constraints or insufficient information, including incomplete and hesitant fuzzy information. These conditions will make it difficult for group decision makers to make correct decisions. In order to deal with the above situation, this study extended the AHP method to propose a flexible AHP method that was proved through a numerical analysis of PHEDM. It did not lose any expertise in providing important and useful information,",1.0,outbreak,True
614,Page 21/25,0.0,,False
615,"and it could overcome the challenges of emergency MCDM problems under uncertain and ambiguous environments. The advantages of the flexible AHP method are summarized as follows: (1) The proposed flexible AHP method can deal with partially nonexistent information in PHEDM for COVID-19. (2) The proposed flexible AHP method can address hesitant fuzzy linguistic information in PHEDM for COVID-19. (3) The proposed flexible AHP method can fully consider the available information. (4) The traditional AHP method (Ashraf and Abdullah 2020) is a special case of the proposed flexible AHP method. Due to the traditional AHP method usually supposed to be independent during criteria assessment, in the future, this article may be able to study in the direction of the correlation among criteria, and preferable to reflect the practical feasibility in the real world.",1.0,COVID-19,True
