If we deeply dive into the number, the pooled percentage of asymptomatic infections was 0.25% among the tested population and 40.50% among the population confirmed with COVID-19.1 Asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers refer to patients with no symptoms at screening point, which includes pre-symptomatic infections (infected people who have not developed symptoms yet, but go on to develop symptoms later), and true",1.0,case,True

Previous studies showed that admission period had negative effects on physical inactive, sleep quality and eating disorders4-5and 24% of participants reported deterioration in sleep quality.6 These negative changes varied from occupations, healthcare workers reported the highest rate of poor sleep quality.7 Apart from sleep problems, the uncertainty and isolation of COVID-19 pandemic also brought about mental health issues, including anxiety, stress and depression.5 A study investigated patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 in China, approximately 20.9% and 18.6% of them had anxiety and depression respectively.8 Furthermore, the risk factors of mental health include sex, age, education, occupation, sleep quality mainly in quarantined population.9-10 Therein, sleep quality is a critical contributing factor, in other words, better sleep quality decreases incidence of mental problems, which has been validated in university students,11 the elderly 12 and COVID-19 patients.13",1.0,asymptomatic,True
22,"Perceived social support refers to the emotional experience and satisfaction that individuals feel respected, supported, and understood from the society. It might be used to interpret the mechanism of psychological or mental health problems.14 Low levels of social support and sleep quality could lead to mental problems in college students and the elderly.15-16 Previous research has repeatedly emphasized the role of social support in the promotion of mental health.17 Although a substantial number of research found this strong relation can hold across a broad range of samples, such as the disabled, healthcare workers, patients with chronic kidney failure and so on,18-21 a handful of studies have presented different results. A meta-analysis has concluded that for the aged people, mental health was weakly or extremely weakly associated with social support.22 Likewise, it has been claimed that the social support is only related to mental health in females only, not in males.23",1.0,social,True
23,"This study included social support as a potential intervention factor and sleep quality as a trigger factor to construct a moderation model that examines the underlying mechanism of mental health among asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers (see Fig. 1).

280,"We examined the potential mechanism underlying the link between sleep quality and mental health in a large sample of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers collected in the Fangcang shelter hospitals. The results indicate that social support has a moderating effect on the relationship between sleep quality and mental health. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that clarifies the underlying moderation mechanism linking sleep quality to mental health in asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers in China.",1.0,asymptomatic,True
281,"The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that nearly 41.10% of the sampled asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers were found to be prone to bad mental health, which was lower than the ratio of psychological problems in other studies.31 For example, an observational, cross-sectional study of 129 patients with mild to moderate illness from Jiangxia Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan, China found that 49.6% of participants had depressive or anxiety symptoms.32A systematic review and meta-analysis on psychological and mental impact of COVID-19 among healthcare workers, the general population, and patients with higher COVID-19 risk published between 1 November 2019 to 25 May 2020. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was the highest among patients with pre-existing conditions and COVID-19 infection (56% [39%-73%] and 55% [48%-62%]).33 This finding was most likely because this study was a survey conducted in Shanghai after the third year of COVID-19 breakout, while other studies started several months or even a year after the COVID-19 occurred. And differences of results may be due to differences from different scales of psychological problems. In addition, asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers mostly have no relevant clinical symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore throat and other self-perceived or clinically recognized symptoms and son on, which could reduce people's mental stress.",1.0,asymptomatic,True
282,"In this study, results indicated that poor sleep quality was a risk factor for mental health for asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers in Fangcang shelter hospitals. A substantial body of literature has shown that stressful life events and outbreaks of infectious diseases, including COVID-19, can affect sleep quality,34-37and 34.3% of the participants suffered from poor sleep quality, which was higher than general population before the outbreak of COVID-19, the pooled prevalence of insomnia in general population was 15.0% in China according to a meta-analysis in 2017.38There is a large amount of data on the effects of sleep quality on mental health in other populations, such as healthcare workers,39 patients recovered from COVID-19, 40frontline nurses.41In addition, the present study demonstrated that patients who perceived lower social support were vulnerable to mental health. This supports prior findings documenting the importance of social support when managing enduring stressors that cannot be quickly and individually worked out.42Social support functions as a buffer for poor sleep quality and bad mental health. For example, those with poor sleep quality following COVID-19 may fail in recuperation and rejuvenation of the brain, which then leads to increased anxiety and depressive mood. Surprisingly, the moderating effect of perceived social support could provide help for patients in response to difficulties.",1.0,asymptomatic,True

284,Page 10/16,0.0,,False
285,"This study has several limitations worth noting. First, this was a cross-sectional study and a causal relationship between sleep quality and psychological distress could not be established. Second, this study adopted a self-rated questionnaire, we cannot exclude the possibility of response bias. In the future research, biological indicator or clinical diagnosis of sleep quality may be used to do evaluation objectively. Third, we could not adjust for other factors that could affect sleep quality and mental health, such as environment, comorbidities, which is good for improving sleep quality and promoting mental health.",1.0,clinical,True
286,"Despite these limitations, we believe that our results are valuable as they included a major sample of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers admitted in Fangcang shelter hospitals in China. It is also meaningful to help inform future public health intervention of the value of quality of sleep in preventing and addressing mental health problems.",1.0,asymptomatic,True
287,5. Conclusion,0.0,,False
288,"The study demonstrated that the significant impact of sleep quality on the mental health on asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers admitted in Fangcang shelter hospitals. Perceived social support was the protective factor of mental health problems. Hence, it is important for hospitals and health care institutions to provide psychosocial support and intervention for asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers to avoid further impact of the epidemic.",1.0,asymptomatic,True
