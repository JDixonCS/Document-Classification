9,"COVID-19, and efforts to mitigate its spread, are creating extensive mental health problems. Experts have speculated the mental, economic, behavioral, and psychosocial problems linked to the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to a rise in suicide behavior. However, a quantitative synthesis is needed to reach an overall conclusion regarding the pandemic-suicide link. In the most comprehensive test of the COVID-19--suicidality link to date, we meta-analyzed data from 308,596 participants across 54 studies. Our results suggested increased event rates for suicide ideation (10.81%), suicide attempts (4.68%), and self-harm (9.63%) during the COVID-19 pandemic when considered against event rates from pre-pandemic studies. Moderation analysis indicated younger people, women, and individuals from democratic countries are most susceptible to suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policymakers and helping professionals are advised that suicide behaviors are alarmingly common during the COVID-19 pandemic and vary based upon age, gender, and geopolitics. Strong protections from governments (e.g., implementing best practices in suicide prevention) are urgently needed to reduce suicide behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.",1.0,COVID-19,True

11,"The COVID-19 virus, and efforts to mitigate its spread, are creating serious mental health problems around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic is linked to alarming increases in depression and anxiety, isolation and loneliness, alcohol and cannabis misuse, and unemploy­ ment and other economic problems (e.g., Killgore et al., 2020b; Luo et al., 2020).",1.0,COVID-19,True
12,"Negative sequelae of the pandemic are also not equally or randomly distributed across people or places. Disadvantaged and marginalized people, such as those who are Black (e.g., Bray et al., 2020) or people with pre-existing mental health problems (e.g., Taylor and Asmundson, 2020), appear especially vulnerable to the pandemic's negative psy­ chosocial impacts.",1.0,Negative,True
13,"Many experts have voiced concerns that mental, economic, behav­ ioral, and psychosocial problems linked to the COVID-19 pandemic may contribute to a rise in suicide behaviors (e.g., McIntyre and Lee, 2020; Samson and Sherry, 2020). These include suggested increases in suicide ideation (thoughts about killing oneself), suicide attempts (non-fatal, potentially self-injurious behavior with intent to die), and self-harm",1.0,social,True

16,"Understanding of the pandemic-suicide link is limited at present. First, non-empirical narrative reviews on COVID-19 and suicide are abundant (e.g., Gunnell et al., 2020), but these reviews do not clarify, quantitatively, how strong an impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on suicide behaviors. Second, among empirical studies, there are notable inconsistencies in findings between studies, with some studies reporting suicide behaviors are higher (e.g., Zhang et al., 2020), and other studies reporting suicide behaviors are largely unchanged (e.g., Isumi et al., 2020). A rigorous quantitative synthesis is needed to resolve these in­ consistencies and reach an overall conclusion. Third, numerous studies on COVID-19 and suicide involve smaller samples (N ,"" < 250; e.g., Benatti et al., 2020), which suggests research on COVID-19 and suicide might be underpowered (see Button et al. (2013) and Ioannidis (2005) for overviews of how sample size affects power). Larger samples are needed to provide more stable estimates of the underlying population (e. g., Scho¨nbrodt and Perugini, 2013). Fourth, moderation analyses will""",1.0,pandemic,True

Age, sex, ethnicity, country of residence, and geopolitics (e.g., living under a democratic government or an authoritarian gov­ ernment) may potentially moderate the relationship between COVID-19 and suicide, clarifying who is more or less vulnerable to suicide be­ haviors during the COVID-19 pandemic and allowing for more targeted interventions.",1.0,pandemic,True
22,1.2. Present study: objectives and hypotheses,0.0,,False
23,"Our objective was to conduct the most comprehensive test of the pandemic-suicidality link to date. We addressed the above-mentioned limitations by conducting a meta-analysis that comprehensively and quantitatively synthesized extant research on COVID-19 and suicide behaviors. Such a rigorous synthesis will help to resolve inconsistencies observed between studies by correcting for distorting artifacts (e.g., small samples). Moreover, meta-analytic moderation will identify po­ tential groups differentially susceptible to suicide behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.",1.0,pandemic,True
24,"Some authors have acknowledged the possibility suicide rates may decrease during the COVID-19 pandemic, with suicide behaviors decreasing as people pull together amid shared pandemic-related ad­ versities (Reger et al., 2020). In contrast, experts have cautioned that mental health and behavioral problems, economic stressors, and psy­ chosocial upheaval linked to the pandemic may lead to a rise in suicide behavior (e.g., Gunnell et al., 2020). Consistent with the latter perspective, we hypothesized a serious increase in suicide behaviors has occurred during the pandemic, including increases in rates of suicide ideation, attempts, and self-harm (relative to event rates available from pre-pandemic studies). Our moderation analyses were exploratory, as there are insufficient data and theory to inform specific hypotheses.",1.0,COVID-19,True

27,"We developed our search strategy in consultation with a Research Data Management Librarian and conducted our search in eight data­ bases: PsycINFO, PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, Web of Science, ERIC, Embase, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. We used the following search terms: (TITLE (suicid*) OR ABS (suicid*)) AND (TITLE (COVID-19 OR ""2019 novel coronavirus disease"" OR ""COVID19 OR ""SARS-CoV-2 infection"" OR ""2019 novel coronavirus infection"" OR ""2019-nCoV infection"" OR ""coronavirus disease 2019 OR ""coronavirus disease-19 OR ""2019-nCoV disease"") OR ABS ((COVID-19) OR ""2019 novel coronavirus disease"" OR ""COVID19 OR ""SARS-CoV-2 infection"" OR ""2019 novel coronavirus infection"" OR ""2019-nCoV infection"" OR ""coronavirus disease 2019 OR ""coronavirus disease-19 OR ""2019-nCoV disease"")). We identified 1010 studies via this search. Two additional studies were identified from the reference sec­ tions of articles identified by our initial search. We terminated our literature search and began our study screening and data extraction on November 6, 2020. The first author and a trained research assistant used the following pre-determined criteria to identify studies eligible for in­ clusion in the current meta-analysis: (a) contained data on suicidal behavior (i.e., ideation, attempts, self-harm) that was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) reported information to calculate the proportion of participants that endorsed suicide behavior during COVID-19; (c) written in English. We did not restrict studies for inclu­ sion based on sample characteristics (e.g., age) or publication type. Agreement between coders on inclusion was 92.36%. We resolved dis­ crepancies in agreement through discussion among the research team until a consensus of 100% was reached. The final dataset was comprised of 54 studies with 62 samples (see Table 1 and Fig. 1).",1.0,COVID-19,True
28,2.2. Coding of studies,0.0,,False
29,"Studies were coded on the following variables: sample size, sample type, mean age, percentage female participants, percentage White par­ ticipants, study design, publication status, country, political regime and democracy index score (as per the Economist Intelligence Unit, 2020), and suicide behaviors (see Table 1). Suicide behavior included ideation, attempts, and self-harm. To calculate event rates of suicide behaviors, behaviors that were assessed on continuous scales were converted to dichotomous values (i.e., to indicate the presence or absence of a given suicide behavior). Dichotomization of continuous variables was completed because many studies included in our analyses had assessed suicide behaviors on a binary scale (e.g., Ammerman et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2020; Every-Palmer et al., 2020).",0.0,,False
30,2.3. Meta-Analysis,0.0,,False
31,"We used Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (Borenstein et al., 2005) to calculate overall effects using random-effect models. For studies with measurement occasions occurring in both the pre-pandemic and the pandemic periods, we extracted data collected during the pandemic period, as there were not enough studies to analyze pre- to post-pandemic changes in our suicide behavior variables. For studies that assessed suicide behavior at multiple time-points during the pandemic period, we averaged the prevalence of these behaviors across measurement occasions to derive a more reliable estimate (see Card, 2016).",1.0,pandemic,True
32,"Homogeneity was assessed by determining the total heterogeneity of weighted mean effects (QT) and the total variation across studies attributable to heterogeneity (I2). When QT was significant, and when there was sufficient content coverage (five or more studies for contin­ uous moderators and three or more samples per subgroup for categorical moderators), random-effect meta-regressions with maximum likelihood estimation were used to test the moderating effect of three continuous and four categorical variables: sex (mean percentage of females), age (mean age), democracy index score (where a higher score indicates a greater level of democracy), sample type (clinical, community, and frontline), COVID-19 restriction type (various restrictions, lockdown, and quarantine), region (North America, Western Europe, and AsiaAustralasia), and study design (case-control, cross-sectional, and longi­ tudinal) on observed event rates. We refer to these analysis as ""moder­ ation"" (e.g., Schmidt and Hunter, 2015; p. 317) because we tested whether point estimates for suicide behavior event rates depended on levels of the different study variables that we coded for. Eight models were tested for each suicide behavior event rate. These models included the following predictors: sex; age; sample type; democracy index score; COVID-19 restriction type; region; study design; and sex, age, sample type, democracy index score, COVID-19 restriction type, region, and study design simultaneously (Supplemental Material A).

We addressed these limitations by conducting a rigorous meta-analytic re­ view of suicide behavior rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings derived from 308,596 participants and 54 studies suggested suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and self-harm have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic (relative to event rates from pre-pandemic studies), with younger people, women, and individuals from democratic coun­ tries appearing most vulnerable to suicide ideation.",1.0,COVID-19,True

457,"Consistent with hypotheses, our meta-analysis suggested increased event rates for suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic. These event rates are high in relation to prepandemic studies; for example, Liu et al. (2020) in their pre-pandemic meta-analysis of nine studies and 40,292 participants, concluded: ""approximately one in 20 individuals in the general population experi­ ence passive ideation in any given year"" (p. 374). However, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 11.84% of community members are experiencing suicide ideation (see Table 2). This suggests that during the COVID-19 pandemic 2.37 in 20 individuals in the general population are experiencing suicide ideation. Put differently, whereas Lui et al.'s (2020) 12-month rate of suicide ideation was 5.81% for community members, our observed rate of suicide ideation for a similar group was 11.84% during the COVID-19 pandemic.",1.0,COVID-19,True
458,"The magnitude of the difference between suicide behaviors before and during the COVID-19 pandemic will depend, in part, on the com­ parison made. Such comparisons also are much less rigorous than lon­ gitudinal data, which we did not cover in the current study due to insufficient data. Thus, pre- to post-pandemic comparisons should be interpreted with great caution. That said, in examining several prepandemic meta-analyses of suicide behaviors (e.g., Castillejos et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020), our observed event rates for suicide ideation, suicide attempts and self-harm stand out as elevated and point toward a serious crisis in suicide behaviors occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic. As most participants in our study reported on their suicide behaviors for a relatively brief time period (i.e., the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic as opposed to reporting on their suicide behaviors for a full 12-months of the pandemic), it is also possible a longer reporting time period would capture an even higher prevalence of sui­ cide behaviors.",1.0,COVID-19,True
459,"We also brought greater specificity to understanding the pan­ demic-suicidality link, with our moderation analyses suggesting younger individuals, women, and those residing in democratic countries are more vulnerable to suicide behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This complements a wider literature suggesting COVID-19s negative impacts are felt disproportionately by some people or in some places (e.g., Bray et al., 2020). In a pandemic where so many are in need, these findings can inform more targeted interventions. Finally, the de­ gree to which a country is democratic appears pivotal in understanding the pandemic-suicide link, with suicide ideation increasing and suicide attempts and self-harm decreasing as democracy increases. There is much to learn about how political systems, public health measures, healthcare, media, and perceived or actual loss of control and freedom influence how suicide behaviors manifest during the COVID-19 pandemic.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Finally, reliable data regarding deaths by suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic were scarce at the time of writing and are therefore absent from our analyses.

467,"Both policymakers and helping professionals are advised that suicide behaviors are rising during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is challenging to identify (Franklin et al., 2017) and to treat (Fox et al., 2020) an indi­ vidual who is likely to die by suicide, perhaps especially during a pandemic that can monopolize healthcare resources and that can discourage help-seeking (e.g., due to COVID-19 contamination fears or lockdown conditions). Despite the difficulty in doing so, population-wide, evidence-based public health interventions designed to prevent suicide should be implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as limiting access to lethal means (e.g., guns) and to suicide-linked substances (e.g., alcohol; see Gunnell et al., 2020). Strong and continued protections from governments against economic stressors (e.g., protections against unemployment or loss of income) are also needed to reduce suicide behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic (see Norstro¨m & Gro¨nqvist, 2015). Consistent with Wang et al. (2021), we believe our findings speak to the importance of adopting measures to mitigate the psychological burden of living amidst a pandemic. These measures include psychoeducation about the impact of individual be­ haviors on mental health (e.g., media consumption; Burhamah et al., 2020), increased access to mental health supports and effective pre­ vention programs that reduce suicidal ideation for vulnerable groups (e. g., Kelly et al., 2020), and normalizing help-seeking behavior (Schwartz et al., 2020)",1.0,COVID-19,True
468,4.3. Conclusions,0.0,,False
469,"Our meta-analysis provides the most comprehensive test of the pandemic-suicide ideation link to date. COVID-19, and efforts to miti­ gate its spread, are linked to a rise in suicide behavior, including increased event rates for suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and selfharm. In particular, our results suggest younger people, women, and individuals from democratic countries are most vulnerable to suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study also aligns with theory and research indicating that the mental, economic, behavioral, and psychosocial problems linked to the COVID-19 pandemic are tied to a rise in suicide behaviors relative to event rates from pre-pandemic meta-analyses.",1.0,pandemic,True
