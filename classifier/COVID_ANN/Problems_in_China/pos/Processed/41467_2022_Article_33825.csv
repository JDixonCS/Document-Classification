7,"We report the first long-term follow-up of a randomized trial (NCT04978259) addressing the effects of remdesivir on recovery (primary outcome) and other patient-important outcomes one year after hospitalization resulting from COVID-19. Of the 208 patients recruited from 11 Finnish hospitals, 198 survived, of whom 181 (92%) completed follow-up. At one year, self-reported recovery occurred in 85% in remdesivir and 86% in standard of care (SoC) (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.47-1.90). We infer no convincing difference between remdesivir and SoC in quality of life or symptom outcomes (p > 0.05). Of the 21 potential long-COVID symptoms, patients reported moderate/major bother from fatigue (26%), joint pain (22%), and problems with memory (19%) and attention/ concentration (18%).

First, we recruited one in four potentially eligible patients treated in our hospitals during the study period to our randomized trial8,9; this enhances the generalizability of the results.

108,"The major limitation of our study is the small sample size. Adequately powered studies (with short follow-up) have earlier demonstrated that remdesivir can prevent the progression to severe disease if given in the early phase of the infection9,10. A fifth of our patients were not receiving oxygen at hospital admission. As the short-term benefits of remdesivir seem larger in non-severe patients9, this could be the subpopulation of hospitalized patients who might achieve long-term benefits as well. Patients experienced much lower in-hospital mortality rates in Finland (2.4%) than in the global trial (15.0%) and were therefore a potentially more suitable patient population (likely earlier phase of the disease) for an antiviral drug8,11. However, our subgroup of patients in this phase was too small to inform this hypothesis. We hope that other COVID-19 treatment RCTs, especially the large trials--such as the RECOVERY and PANORAMIC, will also extend their follow-up to evaluate the potential long-term effects of acute-phase treatment both in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients12-14. Finally, we did not have information regarding potential treatments post-discharge. However, as no specific treatment has been proved effective for longCOVID, this may not be a major limitation.",1.0,disease,True

At 1-year follow-up among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, about one in four patients reported substantial bother from fatigue, and one in six felt their recovery from COVID-19 was incomplete. We could not detect any effect of remdesivir on long-term recovery, quality of life, or long-COVID symptoms, but confidence intervals are wide, including substantial benefit and harm.
