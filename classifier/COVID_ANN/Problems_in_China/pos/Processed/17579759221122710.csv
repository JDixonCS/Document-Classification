5,"COVID-19 continues to challenge all countries around the globe. The pandemic has clearly exposed pre-existing weaknesses in our social, economic and health systems. The wicked problems that the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) called on all nations to comprehensively address are the very issues that have put many people at greater risk for contracting, dying or now contending with the consequences of long COVID19. The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda also pledges to ""Leave no one behind"" (1). To do so requires explicit attention to dismantling systems of oppression such as sexism, heterosexism, ableism, classism and ageism that continue to socially reproduce racial, gender, health, and other inequities.",1.0,COVID-19,True
6,"Mental health is one of the many issues that the pandemic has further highlighted. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), ""mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community"" (2). The promotion of mental health is foundational to personal, community and socioeconomic development. The social and economic consequences of ill mental health affect the fabric of entire societies (3). While not new, the pandemic has accelerated attention to the importance of mental health and related inequities, but will this attention be maintained and translated into sustainable action?",1.0,pandemic,True
7,"The achievement of global mental well-being requires interdisciplinary, intersectoral and intersectional approaches. Mental health clearly aligns with SDG3 (good health and well-being); however, it is influenced by several other SDGs, and this is where the emphasis needs to be - at the intersections of multiple SDGs rather than perpetuating siloed approaches to mental wellbeing. As a health promotion community, we are",1.0,flu,True
8,"well-positioned to co-design, implement and evaluate intersectoral policy and program initiatives that tackle the individual, social, structural, and environmental determinants of mental health inequities. For example, the realization of mental health and well-being is very much related to SDG5 (to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls) and SDG8 (to ""promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all"") (1). Women's mental health has been deeply affected by the pandemic, but they are also crucial to recovery efforts. They make up more than 70% of the global health and care workforce (4). They are also more likely to perform unpaid care and domestic work which UN Women estimates to be between 10% and 39% of the Gross Domestic Product. Yet much of this labor is not formally accounted for, continues to remain invisible and its mental health impacts have not been adequately assessed (5).",1.0,social,True
9,"Unpaid care work is a gendered phenomenon. It represents a critical but undervalued dimension of economic activity, with important dividends for the well-being of individuals, families and whole societies. This work can involve caring for children, older adults and people with disabilities. SDG5 (target 5.4) underscores its importance by calling on all countries to better ""recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of public services and social protection policies..."" (1).",1.0,social,True
10,"Social protection measures do exist and consist of policies and programs designed to reduce poverty and vulnerability by promoting efficient labor markets. These measures can include income security, child and family health care, and human right efforts advocating for progressive policy and legislative changes.

17,"Labour Organization (ILO), 71% of the global population does not have access to social protection, which also includes two billion workers in the informal economy. This means that only 29% of the world's population has access to comprehensive social security (6) and the situation has most likely worsened during the pandemic. COVID-19 has taken more than 6.3m lives and also contributed to what the ILO has called an ""unprecedented loss of jobs and livelihoods"" (7).",1.0,social,True
18,"Social protection is directly related to efforts to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) (SDG3). Of note, one of the key pillars for UHC is financial protection from catastrophic health expenditures. Lack of access to social protection can force people to go to work even when they are sick. We have countless examples of this during COVID-19. Those who do not have the privilege to self-isolate or stay at home because they do not have access to paid sick leave due to their precarious employment status cannot easily adhere to public health advice. If they get too sick, this can result in social exclusion, loss of income, which increases the risk of poverty for workers and their families - all with lasting mental health effects (7). We need to better characterize who is made vulnerable by precarious working conditions in all their various forms, and to document the health and gender implications on mental health and well-being and to evaluate existing social, health and economic policies that otherwise continue to fall short of protecting those in need (8).",1.0,Social,True
19,"As we build back better and more resilient systems, no one discipline, or sector, can tackle complex issues like mental health and its underlying determinants. It cannot be effectively addressed if sectors including the health sector continue to work in silos.
