4,"Abstract: The evolution of the Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus pandemic has revealed that the problems of social inequality, poverty, public and private health systems guided by controversial public policies are much more complex than was conceived before the pandemic. Therefore, understanding how COVID-19 evolves in society and looking at the infection spread is a critical task to support efficient epidemiological actions capable of suppressing the rates of infections and deaths. In this article, we analyze daily COVID-19 infection data with two objectives: (i) to test the predictive power of a Recurrent Neural Network - Long Short Term Memory (RNN-LSTM) on the daily stochastic fluctuation in different scenarios, and (ii) analyze, through adaptive linear regression, possible anomalies in the reported data to provide a more realistic and reliable scenario to support epidemic control actions. Our results show that the approach is even more suitable for countries, states or cities where the rate of testing, diagnosis and prevention were low during the virus dissemination. In this sense, we focused on investigating countries and regions where the disease evolved in a severe and poorly controlled way, as in Brazil, highlighting the favelas in Rio de Janeiro as a regional scenario.

6,"The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19), has severely affected humanity in various segments, such as the public health, economy, and political sectors. Moreover, the disease raises severe infections and has a high spreading capability, which makes it lethal in many cases. By August 2021, about 200 million cases have been counted, with approximately 4.5 million deaths, and as indicated by various studies the normality recovery, even with the available vaccines (Sinovac, Pfizer, Astrazeneca, Moderna, Janssen), will be slow and difficult (Tian et al. 2020, Lauer et al. 2020, Anjos 2020, The Lancet 2020, Sharma et al. 2021).",1.0,pandemic,True
7,"Thus, actions to monitor and control the virus spreading play a fundamental role in reducing the number of infected people and, consequently, the number of related deaths. In this sense, this work brings two complementary machine learning approaches to understanding the stochastic nature of COVID-19. Firstly, we test a prediction strategy for COVID-19 based on Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model.

Such a deep learning model is able to learn intrinsic information in time series data, allowing learning and inferring predictions with good accuracy and precision1. The concept of Deep Learning (DL) corresponds to techniques directed at artificial neural networks to explore and amplify the power of nonlinear data analysis using a large number of intermediate layers (Deng et al. 2014, Goodfellow et al. 2016, Vasilev et al. 2019).

12,"We consider COVID-19 infection reported daily from January to August 2020 (Voz das Comunidades 2020, Worldometer 2020), analyzing the daily transmission fluctuation in a period where the main suppression factor would be social isolation (about six months before vaccination starts). In this study, we focus on observing the evolution of confirmed cases in some countries, especially in Brazil, including data related to favelas in Rio de Janeiro. Such scenarios allow us to infer how robust the LSTM models are to improve the understanding, monitoring and prediction of the infection transmission rate. Therefore, we have applied LSTM models based on specific cause and effect criteria, strictly related to each COVID-19 time series behavior, verifying the effectiveness of these criteria on its fluctuation and evolution in different scenarios. We provide a background of events in the countries that had their first contact with the virus and how the authorities and society have dealt with the pandemic. We looked at certain criteria linked to the disease's behavior and its impacts, such as how symptoms occur, the average time to diagnosis, time to treatment, and the effects of epidemiological control interventions made by the authorities, such as lockdown actions (Tian et al. 2020, Lauer et al. 2020, Zhou et al. 2020, Chen & Yu 2020).",1.0,COVID-19,True
13,"We have analysed data from 12 different countries on a grid of parameters resulting in about 288 predictive time series models. The application of these models in specific regional scenario, as Rio's favelas, helps to identify how the disease evolves in communities that lack basic health structure and conditions that make both social distance and lockdown actions extremely difficult (Voz das Comunidades 2020, Worldometer 2020). In most of these virus transmission scenarios an important aspect to be discussed is the quality of data collection, subject to outliers such as underreporting. Therefore, as a complementary approach we use Adaptive Linear Regression to detect data anomalies (outliers) in the daily cases of COVID-19 infections. This approach allows the data to be treated with more confidence by getting closer to the actual pandemic behavior after removing the outliers values. In this way, the models can come closer to identifying the actual scenario caused by human influence on pandemic control (Taylor & Letham 2017). At this stage, the anomaly detection approach was focused on two specific countries, Brazil and the USA, which, in addition to presenting the anomalies in accounting for daily infection cases, have the worst scenarios related to a large number of infected people and deaths.",1.0,disease,True

The main result achieved for this study was the best forecast model concerning real data on the number of cases in Tianjin, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Italy. The novelty method proposed, uses Fully connected layers to emulate the disease incubation period combined with an LSTM model to find factors that influence potential cases. The authors pointed out that their approach can better handle multiple characteristics, such as the number of cumulative diagnoses, the number of deaths, city lockdown, the number of new diagnoses, the growth rate of deaths, etc. On the other hand, the authors point out that the logistic regression model loses its performance when there are multiple features in the model.

The elimination of upper peaks is necessary as they influence the determination of the expected variation in the data. Figure 12 shows results about outliers identification on Brazil's daily cases of COVID using MAD. For outliers related to lags on cases notification (upper peaks), the method applies a rolling window on data (red curve) with 10 days and median + 3 * MAD as a threshold (blue curve), the data values above this curve are labeled as outliers (black dots) (Figure 12(a)). It is important to mention that the threshold can only be computed until the final centralized window. For all data after this final window, the last computed threshold is used, that is why the blue curve is flat between xlast-5 and xlast. After the identification of peaks, these anomalies points were modified using a median in a centered window with 15 days to correct the weekday trend and permit detect the points of underreporting cases. For outliers related to underreporting daily cases, the rolling window applied has 10 days and median + 0.5 * MAD as a threshold enable detecting valleys points (Lower Outliers) for all values below the blue curve (Figure 12b). It is important to note that this approach seeks to determine the bulk of the data in a way that is not influenced by any outliers, where the tuning of parameters (threshold and window) aims to identify how much deviation from the mass of the data should be considered an anomaly and how far in time should one look to characterize points that not fit well with the data.

While univariate time series (one attribute) use the inter-time correlations. An univariate time series can be defined as a sequence of single observations o1, o2, o3, ..., on on at successive points in time t1, t2, t3, ..., tn.

Important to note that both prediction and smoothing depend on parameters which model stochastic behavior of variables have been estimated, these parameters called hyperparameters, are also based on the Kalman filter. The reason for this is that the prediction errors expressed in terms of one-step-ahead predictions from the likelihood function emerge as a by-product of the filter.

This denial view, partially imposed by low-quality data analysis, contributes to the growth of fatal cases as well as economic and geopolitical crises.
