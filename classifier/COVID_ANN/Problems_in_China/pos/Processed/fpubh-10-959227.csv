81,"Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been more than 516 million documented cases worldwide and over 6 million deaths with a large proportion in the WHO European region (217,646,171 confirmed cases and 1,999,825 reported deaths; data as of 13/05/2022) . People infected with SARS-CoV2 can present with a range of symptoms at different severity levels. In addition to the risk of serious illness and mortality, COVID-19 also poses potential long-term consequences for some individuals, such as prolonged respiratory, neurological, and cognitive symptoms (1-4). Alongside these risks, the health of population has been potentially affected as an indirect result of varied public health measures implemented by the countries to control the pandemic, such as social distancing and lockdowns, which have led to disruptions to routine medical care and management of non-communicable diseases, and increased risks for mental health (5-8).",1.0,COVID-19,True
82,Vaccination strategies against COVID-,0.0,,False
83,"Vaccination has been an essential strategy in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the first vaccine was approved for use in December 2020 by the European Medicines Agency over one billion doses (1,577,389,178; data as of 13/05/2022) have been administered in the WHO European Region . The initial vaccination roll-out was focused on delivering complete primary vaccination series to health and social care professionals and individuals with underlying disease conditions, which progressively was extended to other nonpriority population groups. As multiple COVID-19 vaccines became available at the end of 2020 and start of 2021, health systems worldwide struggled with varying challenges in implementing their vaccination strategies. Many countries continue to face repeated waves of COVID-19 and there have been ongoing fears of variants of concern; for example, in November 2021 the WHO designated Omicron as a variant of concern and, although little was known about the variant at that time, research subsequently showed that it is transmitted much more rapidly than other variants of SARS-CoV-2 (9).

These points underline the vital need to continue to plan and implement vaccinations with short- medium-, and, long-term perspectives. Each country faces different challenges; identifying these difficulties and sharing the methods they used to overcome them are essential. Countries with smaller populations might have specific characteristics that affect them, such as differences in infrastructures or flexibility within their health systems.

The overall objective is to provide a commentary on the data and information about vaccine roll-outs in the SCI countries and discuss the perspectives of people involved in the process, including the key barriers that prevented vaccines from being as widely and quickly administered as possible. Specifically, we aim to describe the challenges that SCI countries faced in procuring vaccines, setting up vaccination sites, and administrating vaccines to different priority groups; describe the systems used for vaccine registration and vaccination efforts for the general population as well as for vulnerable groups; and share the methods that the countries used to address problems. General challenges will be discussed as well as issues faced by specific countries.

When individuals from a higher priority group were unavailable or canceled a booking in Latvia, vaccination staff were instructed to administer excess doses to people from lower priority groups.

Estonia observed a particularly low uptake in older individuals in one county. In response, the authorities launched a ""1 + 1 campaign"" in April 2021, where younger persons would receive a vaccine if they accompanied an older relative, friend, or neighbor to the vaccine site (at that point in time, the younger age group were not eligible to receive vaccines). Latvia observed lower vaccination coverage amongst older individuals (over 88 years of age), possibly due to vaccine hesitancy and reduced access to information from national authorities.

In addition to public health measures, vaccination has been an essential element to control the COVID19 pandemic, and the subsequent introduction of vaccine certificates in the EU and elsewhere helped to open countries up and allow people to travel with reduced COVID-19 risks. Nevertheless, there are substantial challenges in terms of short-, medium-, and long-term planning. Most countries have now faced multiple waves of COVID-19 and several variants of concern have raised new threats. Many countries worldwide are now vaccinating younger age groups but in order to have a wider impact with the available vaccines, it is prudent that the focus should remain on the high-risk vulnerable population groups",1.0,vaccine,True

238,"The strength of the current study is that we were able to interview country focal points via video conferencing to gain first-hand perspectives on examples of good practice as well as challenges in the vaccine roll-outs in the SCI countries. This, combined with details of specific aspects of the rollsout and strategies undertaken by each country, provides a relevant description of the challenges that small countries faced during the initial stages, and these are in line with findings from other studies in the literature that have compared small states and islands in Europe. One paper comparing the impact of COVID-19 in six European microstates (Andorra, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City) discussed how vaccination roll-outs were key in containing the pandemic, and described how all countries except Malta (which benefitted from the EU joint procurement) had to find different ways to procure vaccines from adjacent nations or directly from manufacturers (11). Another article comparing different vaccination roll-out speeds between Cyprus and Malta (12) highlighted that, although the two islands share similar demographic characteristics, formed part of the EU advanced vaccination purchase agreement, and had similar vaccine strategies, there was a slower roll out in Cyprus that may have been due to vaccine hesitancy, differences in the vaccine registration systems, and the fact that individuals could choose which vaccine brand to take. Low vaccination hesitancy and high vaccine doses have been proposed as the major factors underlying Malta's rapid vaccination roll-out (13). However, despite this, Malta experienced higher COVID-19 infection and mortality rates during the second waves, compared to other European island states with small populations (Cyprus and Iceland), emphasizing that vaccine roll-out is not the only factor needed to contain the pandemic, as restrictive measures and governance approaches also play an important role (14).",1.0,vaccine,True
239,"Some limitations deserve mention. First, this paper provides a description of how the SCI countries rolled out their vaccines in the initial stages and does not reflect on the subsequent phases such as the planning for booster dose administration.

241,"In conjunction with planning the practical aspects of ongoing and future vaccination strategies, it is essential to develop interventions to increase vaccination uptake in specific population groups who are hesitant and to assess the effectiveness of such initiatives. Within the SCI, we further plan to establish whether there have been geographical limitations due to land mass or population density in the small countries, particularly any challenges related to urban vs. rural locations. It is also relevant to understand how effective digital tools have been in vaccination monitoring, allocation, and booking in the small countries as well as which population groups need alternative non-digital booking and monitoring systems and how they can be adapted to suit their needs. The SCI will continue to examine such questions during the upcoming months within the domain of the ongoing threat of the COVID19 pandemic.",1.0,pandemic,True
