10,"Objective. The purpose of the study was to ascertain Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQOL) and evaluate oralhygiene practices in patients visiting a dental institution during COVID-19 time. Materials and methods. Face-to face interviews were conducted using a semi-structured close-ended questionnaire,assessing oral hygiene practices and self-reported oral problems perceived in last 6 months, using both Hindi and English version of Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) Questionnaire. Frequency distribution of oral hygiene practices were obtained, and Descriptive statistics computed the scores of OHIP-14. Kruskal-wallis test and Independent t-test were used to match the association of OHIP-14 with demographic variables. Multiple linear regression",1.0,COVID-19,True

Subjective evaluation of OHRQOL (Oral Health Related Quality of Life) using OHIP-14 Porforma resulted in high score for physical pain and psychological discomfort but subjects expressed less discomfort in connection to functional limitation, physical disability, psychological discomfort, social disability and handicap domains of OHIP-14. With progressive increase in age OHRQOL worsened. Females had poor OHRQOL, with significant difference as compared to males. Gender and marital status observed variance in OHIP-14 with statistically significant difference (P <0.000). Conclusion.

14,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) constituted unparalleled challenge to the humanity. WHO asserted COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern on 30th January 2020 and on 11th March 2020 it was announced pandemic. The pandemic has left an ineradicable mark impacting people's life physically, mentally, socially and economically [1]. To break the chain of transmission people were commanded to stay at home by dictating a countrywide lockdown on 24th March 2020 which lasted for more than 8 weeks [2]. The lockdown prohibited people from moving out of their dwellings. Work from home culture was adopted and nearly all educational institutions were closed. Few reports dawned on ramifications of COVID-19 on oral health [3]. The fright of succumbing to COVID-19 heightened during pandemic and as a result many people might have delayed their routine dental care. The medications and therapies used for treating coronavirus disease might have affected oral health resulting in xerostomia, stomatitis and mouth ulcers because of impaired immune system [3]. Since COVID-19 restricted physical movement this evolved in accumulation of dental problems for instance dental sensitivity, pain, bleeding from gums, onset of oral ulcers, salty sensation in mouth, oral malador, need for restoration, need of",1.0,Coronavirus,True
15,"artificial prosthesis and need for removal of teeth [4]. Those affected with COVID-19 could be at danger of contracting oral lesions such as white-hairy tongue, necrotic lesions, reddish macules and haemorrhagic ulcerations. Further poor compromised oral hygiene may cause aspiration of bacteria in oral cavity leading in inflammation of respiratory tract [5]. The earlier notion of Health defined by WHO `Health being a state of complete physical, mental and social well being and not merely absence of disease or infirmity' [6] has changed over the course of time, now health is intermingledwith general health and people's quality of life (QOL) [7]. Now a robust approach has been conceived called Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQOL) that estimates accordingly oral conditions influencing individual's attitude and social functioning [6]. US Department of Health and Human Services defines OHRQOL as a multidimensional constructwhich ponders upon people's comfort when eating, sleeping and engaging in social interaction; their pride; and their contentment with respect to their oral health. OHRQOL also deals with functional factors, psychological factors, social factors, and experience of pain [8, 9] Dental disturbances profoundly influence our social quality of life affecting mentally, emotionally and physically [1013] An estimated 3.5 billion people are believed to be disturbed due to oral disease.

The participants were interviewed face-to-face for OHRQOL, using Oral Health Impact Profile-14 questionnaire (OHIP-14) and oral hygiene practices were evaluated using a semi-structured questionnaire. OHIP-14 is based on theoretical model developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and calculates social impact of oral disorders. OHIP-14 focuses on 7 dimensions which consist of functional limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability and handicap. It gives more prominence to behavioural and psychological impact and is preferred in identifying psychological impact among individuals. The Responses were obtained using 5-point likert scale. Scores ranged from 0 to 56 and were obtained by adding the ordinal values for the 14 items. Higher OHIP-14 scores coincides to poor OHRQOL and lesser scores predict better OHRQOL. For an expected population size of 29,911, the sample size of 391 was determined using online sample size calculator [15] with confidence level set at 0.95 and margin of error at 5%. Thus, 391 subjects reporting to OPD were enquired for OHRQOL and oral hygiene practices using close-ended questionnaire. The respondents were interviewed, how often they felt oral problems over past 6 months using a validated English and Hindi version of OHIP-14.

Nearly half of the subjects occasionally were unable to eat food because of difficulty with their teeth which could be associated with nutritional imbalance [12].

Notably the marital status influenced the OHRQOL which is line with earlier explorations [17, 19]. Gender and marital status observed significant variance in OHIP-14 and a similar association was predicted in a study done on occupational workers [23]. The inference that can be drawn from these points is that married people in general ignore their oral health and need to prioritize this aspect of their life.

293,"Limitations Cross-sectional pattern of this study had certain constraints, such as the subjects might have experienced difficulty in recalling oral problems and this resulted in underestimation of oral problems. No correlation was conducted between OHRQOL and clinical parameters, for instance dental caries and periodontal disease. Social desirability bias could also be one of the contributing factor yielding low scores of OHIP-14, because the participants might have shown inhibition in discussing their oral health during COVID-19. We did not estimate the OHRQOL in subjects who were wearing artificial prosthesis and in those who were completely edentulous.",1.0,clinical,True

295,COVID-19 instilled fear among the general public resulting in delayed approach to seek dental treatment which was responsible for physical pain and psychological discomfort in context to oral problems perceived by the patients.
