72,"SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in Poland on 4 March 2020. As of that date, medical personnel found themselves in a new and uncertain reality that posed numerous challenges. Physicians, nurses, and emergency medical services came into direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Medical technologists and other laboratory personnel were tasked with analyzing biological specimens to identify patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
73,"The pandemic elicited strong emotions in the medical community. Medical professionals were highly motivated to fight the new enemy, help patients and save lives, but at the same time, they were afraid of becoming infected and transmitting the disease to their families. In addition to psychological stress, medical personnel had to deal with a deficiency of personal protective equipment (PPE), staff shortages, overwhelming fatigue and disinformation. Medical professionals are exposed to pathogens on a daily basis, and they are particularly susceptible to infections. Advanced PPE is needed to create a safe and effective work environment for medical personnel (3). However, according to the official data published by the Polish Ministry of Health, 81,844 nurses, 32,872 physicians, 13,410 physiotherapists, 8,416 midwives, 4,616 pharmacists, 4,116 paramedics, 3,986 dentists, and 3,146 laboratory scientists became infected with SARS-CoV-2, whereas 251 physicians, 201 nurses, 24 midwives, 22 pharmacists, seven physiotherapists, seven paramedics, and five laboratory scientists died due to COVID-19 between the beginning of the pandemic and 5 December 2021, despite the fact that strict protective measures had been put into place (4).",1.0,pandemic,True
74,"Medical laboratory scientists also bore the brunt of the health disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Until recently, this relatively small group of medical professionals has been largely neglected in public discourse. Medical technologists performing laboratory analyses remain largely anonymous, and very few people are aware that the results of diagnostic tests influence more than 70% of medical decisions (5). During the pandemic, this group of healthcare workers stepped out of the shadow because medical laboratories were tasked with performing thousands of PCR tests to confirm SARS-CoV2 infections. The public and the authorities became aware that laboratory personnel play a crucial role in healthcare. Special guidelines were issued for dealing with specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing, as well as all biological samples collected from patients with confirmed or suspected COVID19. Similarly to other medical personnel, laboratory scientists became overwhelmed by the immense burden of COVID-19 and rigorous sanitary measures, but they rose to the challenge. This study had been conducted before pandemic restrictions were lifted, but by that time, medical workers' emotional responses to the health crisis clearly differed from their attitudes at the beginning of the pandemic (5, 6).",1.0,COVID-19,True
