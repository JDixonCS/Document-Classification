Orbital/facial edema was the most common presenting symptom (25.7%) as well as sign (28.57%). 68.5% patients were stage 3 (involvement of orbit) at presentation; 33.3% showed medial wall involvement. Treatment included intravenous Amphotericin and oral Posaconazole in all patients, paranasal sinus (PNS) debridement in 94.2%, orbital exenteration was done in 8 patients. Adjuvant retrobulbar Amphotericin B injection was administered in 12 patients with radiological resolution seen in 50% after 1 cycle. In patients with Stage 4 disease who underwent exenteration along with PNS debridement, survival rate was 100% at 30 days, and disease reduction occurred in 87.5% patients (P<0.01). Overall, 68.5% responded to therapy, 8.5% showed progression and mortality rate was 22.85%, at a mean follow up period of 59.5 days.

In addition, in the latest systematic review published by Pal et al., wherein they identified 30 case reports/case series by pooling data retrieved from 99 patients with CAM, most cases were reported from India (72%) [5]. The sudden upsurge of mucormycosis cases in India shows a close link between mucormycosis and COVID -19. The non - judicious use of corticosteroids and oxygen in patients with COVID-19, worsening of blood sugar control and viral-induced lymphopenia have been implicated as probable causal factors [5, 6]. Furthermore, with the cytokine storm in COVID, the resultant endothelial damage and lymphopenia makes the patient more prone to infection with Mucor [7]. The fungal hyphae invades blood vessels causing infarction and necrosis of host tissue. In addition, due to the rapid onset and progression, delay in diagnosis doubles the mortality rate from 35 to 66%; prompting the need for early diagnosis and treatment [4]. Due to the sudden upheaval of the fungal infection challenging the already overburdened healthcare system, it is the need of hour to assess and devise a better management algorithm for prevention, early detection detection and management of the disease for better morbidity and mortality rates.",1.0,case,True

189,"In our study, majority of ROCM affected patients were middle aged men with mean age group of 40.45±6 years, a decade younger than in the latest largest retrospective study (COSMIC report) conducted by Sen M et al.

The major highlight that came forward in our study was that CAM did not affect healthy individuals and all the people affected were predisposed to the disease, with the most common risk factors being steroid usage and uncontrolled diabetes. Out of the 35 patients enrolled, 51.4% had history of steroid intake and 65.7% had diabetes mellitus. These findings are consistent with a systematic review conducted by John et al. in 41 confirmed cases of CAM where 93% were diabetics and 88% had a history of corticosteroid intake [10]. and by Singh et al. [6] which revealed 80% patients were diabetics and 76.3% had history of corticosteroid use. Moorthy et al. [11] recently reported the association of COVID-19 infection with uncontrolled DM and usage of corticosteroids. Furthermore, the incidence of mucormycosis, in our study, was more in people with mild to moderate COVID who were managed under home isolation with unregulated or self-prescribed use of steroid, with average duration of treatment lasting>2 weeks. This led to upstaging of the disease to severe COVID and resultant hospitalization in 65.8% of cases where oxygen supplementation and steroid therapy became the key management. In the pre COVID era, diabetes mellitus has been identified as an independent risk factor for mucormycosis [1, 4] as has been prolonged (>3 weeks) of high-dose systemic corticosteroid [9]; however, there is paucity of literature to state a causal effect relationship with reference to oxygen supplementation, steroid and immunosuppressive drug therapy in COVID-19 patients.",1.0,COVID-19,True

191,"The mode of infection of mucor is usually by inhalation of fungal sporangiospores in the paranasal sinus which upon germination, actively spread into the adjacent spaces-inferiorly to palate, posteriorly to sphenoid sinus, laterally to the cavernous sinus and orbit, and cranially to the brain through orbital apex or cribriform fossa [12, 13]. Most of the patients that presented to us were ROCM stage 3 or beyond at the time of first presentation. It might be due to relatively late presentation for the primary ophthalmic symptoms of the disease entity when fungus has further spread beyond the paranasal sinus and orbit. The onset of first symptom suggestive of mucormycosis was, 70% of the times, within 6 weeks of recovery from COVID infection, the median time duration being 21.5 days from the day of negative RT-PCR report. Our study determined orbital/facial swelling as the most common presenting feature followed by orbital/facial pain, orbital/facial discoloration, dental pain, and ptosis. The most common presenting signs were periocular/facial edema followed by ptosis, periocular/facial discolouration, and hypoesthesia.

Identification of broad non-septate or sparsely septate fungal hyphae with associated tissue damage/ angioinvasion/ necrosis was characteristic of the disease. Contrast enhanced MRI has been proved to be a superior imaging technique over Contrast enhanced CT [9]. MRI was the preferred modality to monitor the extent of the disease.

In addition, 1 ml of retrobulbar Amphotericin B-deoxycholate in the dose of 3.5 mg/dl was injected for stages 3A-3B, on alternate days for 3 days followed by 1 day off before the next cycle. Quadrant was decided based on route of spread as determined on Gd-MRI. The most common side effects noted included chemosis (85%), pain (60%), and proptosis (15%). In the recent reports published on CAM, retrobulbar Amphotericin was given in one patient in the recent study by Dave et al., [15] and they reported radiological resolution with uneventful follow up at 6 months of follow up. Although there is paucity of literature on the safety and efficacy profile of the treatment method, we found that retrobulbar Amphotericin injection, when indicated, caused radiological resolution in atleast 50% patients after 1 cycle of therapy and in 65% patients after 2 cycles. However, larger studies with a non COVID control group is needed to prove the efficacy of the same. Overall, the treatment success rates of their study and the current study were 60% and 68.5%, respectively (p,0.2).",1.0,Clinical,True
195,"Orbital exenteration is done in cases with no visual potential, with diffuse orbital involvement, but with the disease limited to the orbit without or minimal extension beyond cavernous sinus [9]. Few studies have even highlighted orbital exenteration in cases with CNS involvement to be detrimental to survival. In our study, orbital exenteration along with PNS debridement was done in 22.8% patients. (FIGURE 5). With the mean follow up being at least 30 days, 100% of the patients with stage 4 ROCM who had undergone orbital exenteration survived and 87.5% showed regression of disease burden (P<0.01). This was in comparison to 100% mortality seen in those who did not undergo exenteration. Thus, contrary to current belief, surgery in such patients may drastically improve survival, though larger studies are",1.0,case,True
