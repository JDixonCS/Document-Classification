9,"Emergency Life-Saving Drugs (ELSDs) are among the highest-priority healthcare necessities since they must be administered immediately to save patient lives and prevent complications in the most critical conditions. Due to this reason, it is vital to ensure a continuous and undisrupted supply chain (SC) network for ELSDs throughout the country. However, the SC network of ELSDs is very complex and unpredictable, requiring many stages and processes and involving many parties. The recent COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war have increased these SC disruptions even to a greater extent. Due to the associated complexities and uncertainties, the efficient management of ELSDs SC is usually very challenging. Consequently, proper identification and evaluation of ELSDs SC disruption risks are crucial, of which few studies have concentrated yet, especially from an emerging economy perspective. This study aimed to identify and analyze the most impactful risk factors (RFs) that disrupt the ELSDs SC, particularly in a developing country context, to address this research gap. The study identified 14 key RFs to the ELSDs SC from relevant literature and expert feedback. Then, a combination of the Grey theory and the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method was utilized in this study to assess and prioritize the RFs and show the interrelationships among them. The findings suggested that financial and economic risk, non-availability of critical raw material, an influx of infectious disease, and sudden natural disasters pose the greatest threats to the ELSDs SC. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted afterward to evaluate the robustness of the proposed framework. This research is expected to aid the managers of ELSDs SC in maintaining a continuous and undisrupted availability of these essential medicines to save the lives of millions of patients under critical care.",1.0,COVID-19,True

11,"Disruption has a significant impact on all parties involved in any SC. SC risks significantly influence business functions by fluctuating supply and demand [1]. It can potentially disrupt the movement of materials from the production facilities to the end users and thus the flow of money. Hence, organizations are now focusing on better understanding and managing SC risk due to the expenses associated with SC disruptions and consequently, many researchers are now focusing on studying SC disruption risk factors (RFs) in many industrial domains. Bangladesh's emergency life-saving drugs (ELSD) industry primarily depends on imported active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) [2], and the country's SC was severely disrupted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the current Russia-Ukraine conflict has made supplying various goods and raw materials to various industries around this region difficult, significantly impacting the global SC network [3]. This SC disruption has contributed to the slowdown of overall drug",1.0,flu,True

13,"Due to the rising frequency of pandemics, wars, and natural and man-made disasters, there has been an enormous increase in interest among practitioners in studies related to SC disruption in recent years [5]. Risk identification is the initial phase of risk management, in which the risk manager identifies the risk occurrences that need to be investigated further [6]. Unfortunately, the sources of the risks are usually hidden until the consequences are felt. These risks can result in serious financial issues and a significant loss of revenue. Since the severity of disruption consequences depends on their early discovery, businesses must use risk identification to precisely identify the sources of SC risks [7]. To help industries better understand the risks and focus on overcoming the resultant disruptions, exploring the causal link between identified risk variables is essential in mitigating those disruptions. Hence, it is vital for the ELSD industry of emerging economy countries like Bangladesh to identify and assess the risks of SC",1.0,pandemic,True

Since there is no significant research on this context to date, this study, therefore, aims to assess the RFs that may significantly influence the SC performance of ELSD industry. Based on the antecedent discussion, this research tried to answer the following research questions (RQs):",1.0,flu,True

21,This research proposes the following research objectives (ROs) to address the abovementioned RQs to minimize SC disruptions:,0.0,,False
22,"RO1: To identify the RFs that cause disruptions in ELSDs SC. RO2: To rank the identified RFs and then explore the causal relationships between the RFs for mitigating disruption in ELSDs SC. To achieve these ROs, the RFs were first identified through structured literature analysis and then validated with the help of subject matter experts. Then, a combination of the Grey theory and the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method was utilized in this study to investigate the ranking and the causal relationships among the RFs. The traditional DEMATEL technique can aid in discovering structural relationships between RFs by analyzing related digraphs; nevertheless, it is susceptible to data ambiguity [8]. The perspective of a real-life event may be skewed owing to uncertainty and bias in human subjective judgment and lack of awareness [9]. Both fuzzy theory and grey theory can overcome such issues and increase the accuracy of the decision-makers judgment [10]; [11]. However, the key benefits of using the grey sets over fuzzy sets are the simplified calculation method and the ability to provide more reliable results [12]. Grey DEMATEL provides significant advantages in the case of analysis of complicated systems compared to other decision-making techniques. For instance, methods like analytic hierarchy process (AHP), best-worst method (BWM), or step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) can rank the factors but cannot evaluate the causal relationships among them. Moreover, method like interpretive structural modeling (ISM) can only assess relationships when one factor directly influences another but cannot examine indirect correlations. In that sense, grey DEMATEL is more effective than ISM, AHP, BWM, or SWARA techniques, as it acknowledges the overall relationships among the factors [13]. To examine the priority or the ranking of the factors, Garg [14] also found grey DEMATEL to be a superior method compared to the other multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches like TOPSIS, VIKOR, AHP, BWM, and so on. Therefore, this study utilizes a grey DEMATEL-based framework to investigate the complex issues that disrupt ELSD SC and the interrelationships among the identified RFs. The remainder of the paper is structured into the following sections: Section 2 provides a systematic literature review in the context of the ELSD sector. Section 3 provides an overview of the study framework and implemented methodology.

28,"In Bangladesh, ELSD industry is one of the most significant sources of foreign currency since Bangladesh not only produces ELSD for itself but exports a substantial amount to many developed nations, including the USA, Canada, and other various European countries [20]. Local companies supply over 98% of the country's requirement for pharmaceutical goods, with only 2% of those items coming from overseas markets [21]. However, Bangladesh is highly reliant on other foreign countries like China, India, and Russia to import various chemicals and other necessary raw materials for this sector [22]. Due to this reliance, a dynamic and efficient SC between the supplier and the end customer is required to avoid any disruption. However, pandemics, natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, hurricanes, or other geological phenomena, as well as man-made calamities like terrorism, political instability, and other disasters, can have a significant impact on the raw material import, production, and transportation of ELSDs to the end users. These may increase the price of both raw materials and ELSDs. Some studies performed in the related field are presented in Table 1.",1.0,pandemic,True

30,"Healthcare organizations are increasingly touched by various external factors over which they have little control. Table 1 demonstrates that academics and practitioners have sought to assess the risk associated with the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry. Interestingly, all of the previous studies were conducted focusing on either vaccine distribution or the pharmaceutical sector in general, and none concentrated on ELSD SC. The fact that ELSDs help save lives on an emergency basis and disruption of their SC can cause an increase in the emergency room's mortality rate makes it a very important healthcarerelated sector that needs to be explored extensively. However, to date, there has been no strategic analysis of the risk variables affecting the disruption of the ELSD SC in any emerging economy country.",1.0,vaccine,True
31,"Numerous studies have investigated SC RFs in various industrial sectors. For instance, Queiroz et al. [32] conducted a simulation experiment to see how the COVID-19 outbreak might affect SC performance and found that the pandemic epidemic affects companies' supply, demand, and logistics infrastructures, resulting in severe SC instability. Ishola et al. [33] identified and assessed critical disruption risks of a petroleum refinery process unit using a robust fuzzy linguistic assessment methodology. Moreover, Paul et al. [34] studied transportation disruption risk in the pharmaceutical sector using the Bayesian Belief Network (BNN) approach. Simchi-Levi et al. [35] identified risks and mitigating disruptions in the automotive SC. Zhao et al. [36] analyzed the risk of agri-food SC using total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) and Fuzzy MICMAC. Pareto assessment and the best-worst method (BWM) were utilized by Moktadir et al. [37] to evaluate the RFs in sustainable SC operations in the leather sector. However, no research has yet examined the RFs for the SC disruption of the ELSDs sector.

The inability to properly manage such calamitous situations causes severe supply chain disruptions and service quality disruptions, resulting in the loss of human lives [57]. To prevent the interruption of ELSD SC in this instance, prior preparedness for the pandemic and demand management is necessary. Therefore, the company must give this RF the proper amount of attention. The 4th most significant RF is the `transportation and other logistics risk (A3)'. ELSD supply chain disruption may occur due to any disturbance in the transportation network, which can influence the whole chain and result in serious issues, including suspended operations, lost revenues, delayed deliveries, and reputational damage [34]. The government and businesses must take the necessary precautions to minimize such interruptions. `Sudden natural disasters (A1)' is the 5th most influential RF.

Hazardous incidents may disrupt business operations and harm the supply chain system by causing delays, financial losses, and damage to the company's reputation [60]. The 4th and 5th ranked RFs in the cause group are `political instability (A2)' and `information delay (A9)', respectively. `Political instability (A2)' in any region of the globe can severely impact SCs' operational performance [61]. `Information delay (A9)' pauses the flow of information and increases internal uncertainty that may lead to supply chain disruptions [46]. The 6th and 7th RFs of causal group are `transportation and other logistics risk (A3)' and `forecasting errors (A8)'.

Again, `risk from bullwhip effect (A10)' refers to a situation in the supply chain system where a minor change in end-customer demand causes a substantial change in the orders that the upstream suppliers obtain. This phenomenon has a very severe impact on the efficiency of the supply chain [66]. This RF is often impacted by cause group RFs like `forecasting errors (A8)' and `Information delay (A9)'. `Lead time variation risks (A13)' and the `nonavailability of critical raw material (A7)' are the effect group RFs that are also severely impacted by various cause group RFs.",1.0,flu,True

Finally, Fig. 8 illustrates that, with minor variations, the patterns of all the RFs are identical across all the cases. It suggests that the results obtained from this study are robust and, thereby, reliable. Again, Table 10 presents a comparison among the RF ranking obtained from this study (which uses the grey DEMATEL method) with two other popular factor ranking methods, namely SWARA and BWM. Table 10 shows that the rankings from SWARA and BWM are pretty close to the ranking obtained from the grey DEMATEL method, which validates the proposed framework's ranking. However, since the processes used to get the factor weights in SWARA or BWM are not the same as grey DEMATEL, a slight variation among the rankings is observed, even though the same group of experts participated for all three methods (grey DEMATEL, SWARA, and BWM).

They found changing customer preferences, ineffective effluent treatment, and incorrect solid waste disposal to be the three most essential RFs. Again, Sakib et al.

This study aims to increase awareness about the evaluated RFs among individuals who want to or are now working on improving the ELSDs SC. Proactive planning and appropriate preparations can help attain a better achievement level. A manager tasked with preventing disruptions in the ELSDs SC must make extensive efforts to limit the losses caused by natural disasters, erroneous capacity planning, and forecasting errors.

586,"ELSDs are usually administered very quickly after or during a medical emergency. As a strategic product, the availability of these life-saving medications is an important priority for every healthcare system. Multiple risks affect various parts of the ELSDs SC. Due to the critical nature of ELSD SC, it is vital to analyze the associated risks and take proactive measures to mitigate them. This research is one of the first contributions to the literature on identifying and assessing the SC disruption risks in the ELSD industry of an emerging economy like Bangladesh. We applied a Grey theory-based DEMATEL framework to evaluate the RFs since it allows us to get acceptable results despite the ambiguity and errors in human judgment. This analysis reveals that `financial and economic risk (A6)', `non-Availability of critical raw material (A7)', `an influx of infectious disease (A5)', and `sudden natural disaster (A1)' are the top four most crucial RFs responsible for disrupting the ELSDs SC. Again, enhancing the performance of ELSD's SC demands substantial administrative attention, to which the top management of the relevant sectors should pay more attention too. The results obtained from this research were later communicated and validated by the experts, SC managers in the healthcare industries and academia to ensure its proper applicability. The study findings might assist other developing nations in analyzing the potential risks in their ELSD SC to overcome their vulnerabilities and improve overall operational resilience.",1.0,flu,True
587,"The study has some limitations that can be overcome in future research attempts. Even though the grey-based DEMATEL is a highly effective tool for analyzing the contextual relationships between RFs in an uncertain environment, this system relies heavily on expert feedback. Therefore, it is advisable that the feedback from the experts should be gathered with more caution. Again, a larger number of experts should be engaged in future research to reduce the possibility of opinion bias in the obtained results. Moreover, this study only examined fourteen RFs for the SC disruption, which is not an exhaustive list. In the future, more significant RFs can be explored and included into the existing framework. Future researchers can also utilize this framework to analyze SC disruptions in other sectors, such as the construction, manufacturing, chemical, and service industries of different country perspectives.",0.0,,False
