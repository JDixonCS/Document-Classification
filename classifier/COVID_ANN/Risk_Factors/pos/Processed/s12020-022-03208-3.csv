6,"Abstract Background This paper reports results from the 5th International Conference ""Controversies in Vitamin D"" that was held in Stresa, Italy, 15-18 September 2021. The conference is part of this series that started in 2017 and has been conducted annually since. The objective of these conferences is to identify timely and controversial topics related to Vitamin D. Dissemination of the results of the conference through publications in peer-reviewed journals is an important means by which the most up to date information can be shared with physicians, investigators, and other health care professionals. Vitamin D and aging, the subject of this paper was featured at the conference. Methods Participants were selected to review available literature on assigned topics related to vitamin D and aging and to present their findings with illustrative material, the intent of which was to stimulate discussion and to arrive at a consensus. The presentations were directed towards the following areas: impact of aging on vitamin D production and levels; skeletal effects of vitamin D deficiency in the older population; falls and vitamin D in the aging; potential extra skeletal effects of vitamin D; and strategies to prevent vitamin D deficiency. A final topic was related to how vitamin D might influence the efficacy of vaccines for Covid-19. Results Hypovitaminosis D can lead to several skeletal and extra-skeletal outcomes. Older adults are at risk for vitamin D deficiency as both production and metabolism of vitamin D change with aging due to factors, such as reduced sun exposure and reduced production capacity of the skin. Skeletal consequences of these age-related changes can include reduced bone mineral density, osteomalacia and fractures. Potential extra-skeletal effects can include added risks for falls, reduced muscle strength, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Strategies to avoid these vitamin D deficiency-related negative outcomes include sun exposure, food fortification, and supplementation. While aging does not diminish sufficient reserve capacity for cutaneous vitamin D production, concerns about skin cancers and practical matters for the institutionalized elderly limit this option. Supplementation with vitamin D is the best option either pharmacologically or through food fortification. Regardless of treatment strategies, interventions to restore sufficient vitamin D status will show positive results only in those who are truly deficient. Thus, treatment goals should focus on avoiding 25(OH)D serum levels <30 nmol/l, with a goal to reach levels >50 nmol/l. Conclusions The results of this conference has led to consensus on several issues. Vitamin D supplementation should be combined with calcium to reduce fractures in the older population. The goal for adequate Vitamin D status should be to reach a serum level of 25(OH)D >50 nmol/l. It appears that daily low-dose vitamin D regimens reduce the risk of falling, especially in the elderly, compared with infrequent, large bolus doses that may increase it. The role of Vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength remains to be clarified. On the other hand, supplementation decreases the risk of progression to T2D from prediabetes among those who are Vitamin Ddeficient. Of three possible strategies to establish vitamin D sufficiency - sunshine exposure, food fortification, and supplementation - the latter seems to be the most effective and practical in the aging population.",1.0,area,True

13,"of this series that started in 2017 [1-7]. The objective of this conference, which featured international experts and leaders, was to review and discuss controversial topics regarding vitamin D. Four sessions addressed different major aspects of vitamin D: aging, gastrointestinal system, guidelines, and COVID-19. Before the event, participants reviewed the available literature on their assigned topic and presented their findings at the time of the conference. After each presentation, open sessions enabled full discussion to reach a consensus. A separate document was prepared for each component of the conference.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Randomized clinical trials were given preference; when these were not available, observational, experimental, or opinion studies were also considered. Finally, although it is rather difficult to define the terms ""older population"" or ""older subjects"" as age cut-offs vary within the studies and can range from >65 years to >75 years, in general many studies define it as >65 years.",1.0,clinical,True

16,"Both the production and metabolism of vitamin D change with aging. Causes include decreased sun exposure and reduced capacity of the skin to produce vitamin D.

18,"concentration of 7-dehydrocholesterol decreases by more than 50% from ages 20 to 80 years. Moreover, isolated, aged skin produces approximately 40% less vitamin D than younger skin [8, 9]. A more recent study by Chalcraft and colleagues calculated an age-related reduction in vitamin D production of 13% per decade, demonstrating production at 70 years to be half of that at 20 years (Fig. 1) [10].",0.0,,False
19,"These issues are even more apparent in the housebound elderly and nursing home residents [11]. Additional factors accounting for the risk of vitamin D deficiency in the older population relate to relative vitamin D resistance to stimulating calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and age-related renal function reduction. The aging kidney is also less able to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D from 25hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) [12].",1.0,,True
20,"Despite issues related to aging, a single 15-minute sun exposure (>40% body area) results in considerable vitamin D production in the skin, not only in younger volunteers but also in older ones [10]. The authors concluded that age accounts only for 20% of the variation in D3 production. Thus, while aging may reduce cutaneous synthesis, sunlight exposure is still a significant source of vitamin D3 [10]. Other studies in nursing home residents support this conclusion. It has been demonstrated that irradiation with artificial UV light with half the minimal erythematous dose three-times per week on a surface of 1000 cm2 of the back increased mean serum 25(OH)D from 25 nmol/l to 60 nmol/ l within 3 months, similar to daily oral vitamin D3 400 IU supplementation [13]. This observation suggests that under those conditions, 1000 cm2 exposure of skin every day may result in an increase of serum 25(OH)D comparable to daily supplementation of about 800 IU of vitamin D, such as daily recommendations for those >70 years. As the skin surface amounts to more than 15,000 cm2, the theoretical amount of vitamin D that could be produced in the skin is potentially high. For example, in another study from the same center, eight psychogeriatric vitamin D-deficient patients underwent half-body UV irradiation once a week with half of the minimal erythematous dose (2 min) for 8 weeks. The median serum 25(OH)D increased from 26.5 nmol/l (range 12-58) at baseline to 43.5 nmol/l (range 36-71) [14]. Thus, UV exposure effectively triggers cutaneous vitamin D synthesis even in older patients.",1.0,area,True
21,"The potential of vitamin D production in the skin depends, of course, on a series of well-known factors that can facilitate or mitigate this process.

Fat content persists as a variable even after adjustment for age, season, and smoking in men and women. The two mechanisms appear to be reduced production and higher distribution volume of vitamin D [18]. As the aging population is experiencing a worldwide increase in BMI, especially in rural areas [19], obesity looms large as an increasingly important factor to account for reduced levels of 25(OH)D. Along with the increase in BMI, trends from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) also show a secular decrease in physical activity in men and women, which may be another factor [20]. Indeed, physical activity is positively related to serum 25(OH)D levels [21, 22]. With regard to gender, it is well known that vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in men than in women in the general population. This is true also in older populations [23-25], although the difference between older men and women seems to become of smaller magnitude [23].",1.0,area,True
33,"In summary, despite the reduction in vitamin D production with aging, cutaneous reserve capacity for production should be ample. It is, therefore, possible that most older people can produce sufficient vitamin D from the sun. Nonetheless, meeting vitamin D requirements for housebound and institutionalized people almost always requires vitamin D supplementation. Factors that might restrict the availability of vitamin D should be avoided, particularly in older individuals.",1.0,,True

36,"effects of milder degrees of vitamin D deficiency have recently come under question. Milder degrees of vitamin D deficiency contribute to the development of osteoporosis, but supplementation with vitamin D alone does not appear to reduce fractures. In this regard, it is worth noting that vitamin D is a threshold nutrient. Skeletal benefits in the elderly will not likely be seen in those who are mildly vitamin D deficient and certainly not in those whose serum 25(OH)D is above the threshold value. On the other hand, in severely vitamin D-deficient individuals, the beneficial effects of vitamin D to reduce fracture risk are more likely to be appreciated. The best example of this expectation comes from the pivotal trial of Chapuy et al. [26]. Daily supplementation with vitamin D (800 IU) and calcium (1200 mg) of older, ambulatory French nursing home and apartment-dwelling women resulted in a reduction of hip and other non-vertebral fractures by 43% and 32%, respectively, over 18 months [26]. In this population, the mean baseline serum 25(OH) D concentration was only 36 nmol/L. However, tests were conducted with an old competitive protein binding assay with 80% higher values than high-performance liquid chromatography. Cross-calibration with highperformance liquid chromatography confirmed this and yielded even lower concentrations, mean value around 20 nmol/L, clearly indicating that most participants had moderate or severe vitamin D deficiency [27].",1.0,trial,True
37,"Another contributory factor that places severely vitamin D-deficient individuals at risk is vitamin D deficiencyrelated increases in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. This secondary hyperparathyroidism could contribute, at least in part, to the pathophysiology of bone loss and fracture risk among severely vitamin D-deficient individuals.",1.0,,True
38,"Two older studies have provided insight into a possible threshold value for 25(OH)D below which PTH levels are likely to rise. In the MORE trial [28], serum PTH was higher in two groups of women with different degrees of vitamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH)D < 25 nmol/L and",1.0,trial,True

Both groups showed a significant decrease in serum PTH after vitamin D treatment, while serum PTH did not decrease after vitamin D treatment in the group with serum 25(OH)D > 50 nmol/L. A study based on data collected within the LASA [29] found a 25(OH)D threshold value ranging from 40 to 60 nmol/l. In another study in osteoporotic postmenopausal women [30], the threshold for a secondary increase in PTH also appeared to be at a serum 25(OH)D concentration around 50 nmol/L.",0.0,,False
41,"Some controversy continues to exist about the precise 25(OH)D level below which PTH levels increase. If such a threshold could be clearly identified, one might define the extent of vitamin D deficiency by the extent of the secondary hyperparathyroidism induced by vitamin D deficiency. However, this threshold may also depend on other factors, such as calcium intake and physical activity.",1.0,,True

43,"Attempts to define a threshold have been recently published. A sub-study of the New Zealand Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) study of older community-dwelling men and women showed that monthly dosing of 100,000 IU vitamin D for 2 years did not prevent bone loss from the femoral neck and hip [31]. However, mean baseline serum 25(OH)D levels were 55 nmol/L, indicating a non-deficient population. A pre-planned exploratory analysis showed clinically meaningful reductions in bone loss at the spine, femoral neck and total hip, which were statistically significant at the spine and femoral neck, in participants with a baseline serum 25(OH)D < 30 nmol/L. By contrast, smaller reductions in bone loss at the total hip alone were seen in those with baseline serum 25(OH)D > 30 nmol/L. PTH levels were not measured in this study. In the entire cohort of the ViDA study, with a mean baseline serum 25(OH)D concentration of 66 nmol/L and an adequate calcium intake, vitamin D3 supplementation over 3.3 years did not reduce the incidence of fractures [32].",1.0,community,True
44,"In the second study, the Aberdeen study [33], recruited 305 postmenopausal women in late winter and randomized them to receive vitamin D 400 IU/day or 1000 IU/day, or placebo over 1 year. A post-hoc analysis showed significant beneficial effects of vitamin D 1000 IU/day on both spine and hip BMD in those with baseline 25(OH)D  30 nmol/L, but no significant effects in those with baseline 25(OH)D above this level. These studies support the notion that adverse skeletal effects are most likely in older individuals with serum 25(OH)D levels <30 nmol/L, in whom supplementation with vitamin D would have the most definitive skeletal benefits.",0.0,,False

46,"Dietary sources of vitamin D are scarce. Most frail older individuals following a western diet have a low dietary intake (i.e., around 150 IU) of vitamin D each day [34-36]. As noted above, they are limited in their sun exposure and capacity for cutaneous vitamin D synthesis [8-10]. They also may consume insufficient amounts of calciumcontaining foods [37]. Older adults, thus, are likely to be at risk for both vitamin D deficiency and insufficient dietary calcium intake. Therefore, most older individuals should benefit from vitamin D and calcium supplementation. Metaanalyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that vitamin D, when combined with calcium and a compliance rate of >80%, decreases the incidence of hip fractures and other non-vertebral fractures by 16% and 14%, respectively. The effect on fractures is greater in 70to >80-year-olds compared with 60-70-year-olds and in institutionalized rather than in the community-dwelling older population [38, 39]. A more recent meta-analysis by Yao and colleagues resulted in a similar conclusion, with vitamin D showing a 6% reduction in risk of any fracture and a 16% reduction in risk of hip fracture, but only if taken with concomitant calcium supplementation [40].",1.0,trial,True
47,"Based upon our current knowledge, there is general agreement that serum 25(OH)D < 30 nmol/L in the older population should be avoided, as skeletal effects of vitamin D deficiency, such as a decrease in BMD, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and mineralization defects (osteomalacia) appear to be most evident, and are most likely to occur, below this threshold. Treatment goals should focus on avoiding 25(OH)D serum levels <30 nmol/l, with a goal to reach levels >50 nmol/ to ensure that the adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency are avoided.

It is worth noting that the intra-study mean serum 25(OH)D level in a subset of participants in the placebo group was 77.5 nmol/L, reflecting a vitamin D-sufficient state. The mean serum 25(OH)D was 114.8 nmol/L in a subset of treated participants.

These variables make it difficult to determine the relationship between vitamin D status and fall risk and which population segments may benefit from supplementation.

Previous meta-analyses suggested that vitamin D supplementation slightly improved muscle strength [48]. However, several intervention studies have been withdrawn [43]. A novel meta-analysis excluding such data and including more recent studies revealed that vitamin D supplementation did not have beneficial effects on various aspects of muscle strength and had a negative impact in some cases [43].",1.0,negative,True
73,"Muscle strength is important in the older population since it can influence falls (see above). While the relationship between falls and vitamin D deficiency has been explored above, adjunctive factors, like muscle strength, might be important. Classically, we consider vitamin D deficiency as affecting two distinct musculoskeletal pathways, one involving effects on neuromuscular tissue leading to falls and fractures and the other through decreased calcium absorption, leading to increased levels of PTH, increased bone resorption, and bone loss also leading to increased fracture risk. A related possibility is that the increased circulating PTH levels, seen in vitamin D and calcium deficiency, have a direct untoward dysfunctional effect on muscle. Preclinical and clinical evidence for a direct effect of PTH on muscle exists. Intact, bovine PTH and the synthetic 1-34 fragment of PTH increased muscle degradation and release of newly synthesized alanine and glutamine from skeletal muscle in rats [49]. Clinically, neuromuscular signs and symptoms and muscle weakness have been described in patients with advanced primary hyperparathyroidism, with muscle weakness reversing soon after successful parathyroid surgery [50, 51]. Two groups of older women with similar clinical characteristics and low 25(OH)D levels but different PTH levels (above or within range) performed differently in several muscle strength and function tests. The group with higher PTH levels had lower knee flexion strength, lower maximal muscle force production and reduced postural stability. In contrast, several other muscle strength and balance measures did not differ in the two groups [52]. One small observational study examined the role of PTH in falls in 83 nursing home residents with a mean age of 84 years, a mean 25(OH)D level of 27 nmol/L and a median PTH level of 5.2 pmol/L (reference range 1-6.5 pmol/L), during which 33 participants fell at least once [53]. Those who fell had lower 25(OH)D levels and higher PTH levels, whereas the 1,25(OH)2D levels in the two groups did not differ significantly. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the PTH level was an independent determinant of falling [53].

Moreover, two other trials [67-69], specifically designed to prevent diabetes, showed that vitamin D supplementation, compared with placebo, reduced the risk of developing diabetes by 10-13% in persons with prediabetes not selected for vitamin D deficiency [70]. This is in line with two recent meta-analyses concluding that vitamin D supplementation decreased the risk of progress to T2D by about 10%, especially when using doses above 1000 IU/day and in nonobese subjects [71, 72].

It should be noted that vitamin D exerts a variety of favorable effects on neural and endothelial dysfunctions, which could potentially explain a protective role against neurodegenerative processes [75, 76]. Placebo controlled trials seem to confirm these findings. Vitamin D supplementation in older subjects with dementia or mild cognitive impairment was shown to improve cognitive functions measured with full scale intelligence quotient, and information, digit span, vocabulary, block design, and picture arrangement scores compared to placebo, even after adjustment for confounding factors [77-80]. Moreover, supplementation was able to reduce amyloid -related biomarkers in patients with Alzheimer disease [78]. Finally, vitamin D seems to have differential effects on domain-specific cognitive measures and that a higher dose may negatively affect reaction time. Participants taking 2000 IU/day performed better in learning and memory tests compared to other regimens, yet dosages of 4000 IU/day resulted in slower reaction time compared to the 600 IU/d group [79]. Larger and longer trials taking into account various dosage regimens and the different cognitive domains will help clarify the role of vitamin D in tackling cognitive impairments.",1.0,protective,True

104,"Improving vitamin D status with higher UV exposure is controversial. The World Health Organization assumes that the health threats caused by UV exposure might outweigh the health risks induced by vitamin D deficiency. Nonmelanoma skin cancer accounts for one-third of all cancers worldwide and is present mainly in the older population, with UV exposure being their main cause [82]. Although this strategy is debated, it should be recognized clearly that there is a worldwide seasonal variation of serum 25(OH)D levels, increasing after summer. Sunny countries have better vitamin D status, with a lower prevalence of rickets and osteomalacia. Therefore, the amount of local UV radiation is relevant to providing a greater supply of vitamin D from nature. Older skin is well capable of producing vitamin D, as already discussed [82].",1.0,,True
105,"Consistent with this, in a study performed in Sao Paulo, Brazil (latitude 23oS), 110 adults older than 55 years (mean ± SD: 67.6 ± 5.4 years), and regularly registered in an outdoor physical activity program, had an average serum 25(OH)D levels of 78.9 ± 31 nmol/l during winter, which improved to 91.6 ± 32 nmol/l in summer, without supplementation [83]. Severe vitamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH) D < 25 nmol/L) was seen in less than 4% of subjects, and only during winter, but no summer improvement was seen in women, in those older than 70 years old and black individuals. On the other hand, at the same time and city, 177 Brazilians living in nursing homes had much lower serum levels of 25(OH)D even after summer (42.1 ± 26 nmol/l), with 50% of them with levels <25 nmol/l [83].",0.0,,False

108,"Age and sunlight exposure are important factors that influence serum 25(OH)D levels. The outdoor activity could be considered a reasonable measure to prevent severe vitamin D deficiency and improve other health and wellbeing outcomes. However, the population must be educated about the risks of excessive sun exposure to avoid sunburn, about the use of sunscreen, and how to identify cancerous skin lesions early. Despite these considerations, a change in lifestyle as already known from other chronic conditions, such as obesity, is difficult to be persistently achieved and rarely finds adequate space in medical consultations.",1.0,flu,True

111,"In the last 3 years, two important statements have been published, one from the 2nd Rank Prize Funds Forum on vitamin D [36] and one from the European Calcified Tissue Society [88]. These highlighted the public health aim to decrease the risk of rickets and osteomalacia and avoid serum 25(OH)D levels below 25 nmol/L. These two documents concluded that fortification of foods is an urgent, tobe-implemented strategy, especially for groups at risk for severe vitamin D deficiency, such as children and adolescents, ethnic minority groups, and the institutionalized elderly. There are two very good examples supporting this strategy. In Finland, milk products were fortified with vitamin D from 2003 onwards. In 2000-2011, this public health policy increased serum 25(OH)D from 49.7 to 66.3 nmol/l in people aged 65-74 years, and similarly from 43.0 to 65.1 nmol/l in people of 75 years of age or older [89, 90]. This improvement was uniform across seasons, educational status, smoking status and BMI [90].

117,"Considering these options, vitamin D supplementation seems to be the easiest way to achieve vitamin D sufficiency in an efficient manner, especially for older and institutionalized populations [7]. Most of the various regimens that have been tested demonstrate a dose-dependent increase in serum 25(OH)D levels, but there is great individual variability. As some studies using intermittent high-dose vitamin D supplementation have described an increased risk of falls and fractures, daily or weekly doses are preferred. However, the ViDA study that administered 100,000 IU of vitamin D monthly did not report an increase in fractures or falls [91].",1.0,,True
118,"To further shed light on vitamin D supplementation, Cashman and colleagues calculated the daily dose to reach the target serum 25(OH)D level in the blood, based on a meta-regression analysis of individual participants from seven winter-based RCTs, including 882 patients aged from 4 to 90 years [92]. They concluded that the daily dose to avoid severe deficiency (i.e., reaching 25 nmol/l in 97.5% of the individuals) is 400 IU. In comparison, 1000 IU daily is needed to reach the safer level of 50 nmol/l; however, 1000 IU daily is a higher dose than earlier recommended by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and other regulatory agencies.",0.0,,False
119,"While vitamin D supplementation is the best option for the institutionalized (as they are likely to get it freely), in the general population, especially in the lower-income and culturally and linguistically diverse groups, including migrants and refugees, supplementation may be challenging, even with free distribution. In contrast, food fortification will increase vitamin D status over the population as a whole, preventing severe deficiency and avoiding rickets and osteomalacia in large populations, especially for high latitude countries or in groups at high risk. Ideally, a combination of fortification and supplementation is required to tackle vitamin D deficiency and raise serum 25(OH)D levels to 50 nmol/L throughout the entire population.",1.0,,True

Indeed, low vitamin D levels have been associated with increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and increased COVID-19 clinical impact (Fig. 3) [94, 95]. Moreover, vitamin D supplementation was shown to boost antigenspecific immunity in older adults with suboptimal vitamin D status [96], and to decrease the severity of COVID-19, as demonstrated by a reduced need for intensive care and decreased mortality risks [97]. To this point, vitamin D might be helpful, specifically in areas, such as southern Europe, where hypovitaminosis D is prevalent. If vitamin D is to be utilized to improve the host response to COVID-19 vaccination, this may present a unique opportunity to address the widespread prevalence of hypovitaminosis D. Repleting populations that are being immunized against COVID-19 with vitamin D may address the double pandemic of COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency [98].",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

125,"Vitamin D production decreases with age, but the aging skin can produce sufficient vitamin D when exposed to UV light. However, this remains a challenge, especially in the institutionalized. Vitamin D supplementation should be combined with calcium to reduce fractures in the older population. The goal for adequate vitamin D status should be to reach a serum level of 25(OH)D > 50 nmol/l. It appears that daily low-dose vitamin D regimens reduce the risk of falling, especially in the elderly, compared with infrequent, large bolus doses that may increase it. The role of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength remains to be clarified. On the other hand, supplementation decreases the risk of progression to T2D from prediabetes among those who are vitamin D deficient. Finally, of the three possible strategies to gain vitamin D sufficiency-- sunshine exposure, food fortification, and supplementation --the latter seems to be the most effective and practical.
