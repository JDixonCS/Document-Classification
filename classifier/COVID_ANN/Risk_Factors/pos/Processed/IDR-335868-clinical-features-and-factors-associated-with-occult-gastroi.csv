11,"Background: There has been an increasing number of COVID-19 patients around the world. Since some patients developed with gastrointestinal bleeding, our study focused on the clinical features and gastroscopic findings of these patients, and factors associated with occult gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients and Methods: In this retrospective, observational study, we collected 368 COVID-19 patients who performed fecal or gastric occult blood from Wuhan Tongji Hospital, Jin Yin-tan Hospital, and Wuhan Union Hospital between February 1, 2020 and March 6, 2020. Clinical features were compared between patients with or without occult gastrointestinal bleeding, and gastroscopic findings of seven patients were described. Logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the factors associated with occult gastrointestinal bleeding. Results: In total, 43 (11.7%) patients presented occult gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas 35 (81.4%) of severe cases. CRP level, prothrombin time and D-dimer were higher, while lymphocyte count and albumin levels were decreased in patients with occult gastrointestinal bleeding. Gastroscopy in seven COVID-19 patients showed mucosal congestion, erosion or scattered bleeding at different sites. Albumin levels (OR, 0.856 [95% CI 0.793-0.924]; p < 0.001), prothrombin time (OR, 1.267 [1.089-1.475]; p ,"" 0.002) on admission and severe disease (OR, 4.157 [1.765-9.791]; p "","" 0.001) were independent factors associated with GIB in COVID-19 patients, while antiviral drugs and glucocorticoid therapy were not associated with it. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients with occult gastrointestinal bleeding suffered from worse prognosis. Patients with decreased serum albumin levels or prolonged prothrombin time, and severe cases were at higher risk of occult gastrointestinal bleeding.

Therefore, disease severity, antiviral therapy, glucocorticoid therapy, albumin level and prothrombin time were entered into logistic regression models.

Serum albumin is one of the most important proteins in human plasma, the function of which is to maintain stabilization of blood colloid osmotic pressure and nutri­ tion. In animal experiments, it was proved that serum albumin has protective effects, including improving arter­ ial hyporeactivity in patients with endotoxemia, reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury, and exerting antiinflammatory effects.15-17 Hypoalbuminemia is asso­ ciated with poor prognosis in many diseases and patients with hypoalbuminemia had higher mortality rate and longer length of hospital stay.18 Low serum albumin levels may cause mucosal edema through decreasing the plasma colloid osmotic pressure, which may exacerbate mucosal damage caused by stress or other factors. Previous study has demonstrated that serum albumin is a significant predictor of short-term mortality in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and intravenous infusion of albumin shortens the duration of hospitaliza­ tion for patients with peptic ulcer bleeding complicated with hypoalbuminemia.19",1.0,disease,True
285,"Based on our results, the risk for occult gastrointest­ inal bleeding was much higher in severe patients, which was possibly because of stress-related mucosal disease (SRMD) in critical cases. SRMD may be caused by hypotension, hypovolaemia, high levels of catechola­ mines, release of proinflammatory cytokine or vasoconstriction.20 In our study, seven critically ill patients showed SRMD under gastroscopy.

Moreover, the proportions of organ injury and mechanical ventilation were remarkably higher in cases with occult GIB.

Previously, coagulopathy has been reported as a risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding, prolonged PT may aggra­ vate gastrointestinal bleeding caused by mucosal damage.14 Inflammatory response and coagulation are two important host defense mechanisms, and the response will increase with the severity of the disease, which may cause potential damage to the host.24 Coagulation abnormality is associated with an increased risk of death in patients with COVID-19. Autopsy results of COVID-19 patients show typical platelet-rich throm­ bus deposits in the small vessels of the lungs and other organs. It suggests that coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 is the combination of low-grade disseminated intravascular coagula­ tion and localised pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy, which may have a significant impact on organ dysfunction.25 In critically ill patients, cytokine storm characterized by high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines can be observed, and the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-",1.0,COVID-19,True
