10,"Objectives: Laryngeal complications have been reported after endotracheal intubation and prone positioning in patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but their association is unclear. In this study, we investigated the rate of laryngeal complications in patients with COVID-19 compared to an alternative condition (control group). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 40 patients who underwent endotracheal intubation for either COVID-19 or an alternative condition (control group). Data on age, sex, body mass index (BMI), cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, use of prone therapy, duration of endotracheal intubation, and duration from extubation/tracheostomy to laryngeal evaluation were collected from medical records. Results: There were no significant differences in BMI, frequency of CVD risk factors, duration of endotracheal intubation, or duration from extubation/tracheostomy to laryngeal evaluation between the two groups. In the COVID-19 group, all patients adopted the prone position. In comparison, only one patient in the control group adopted the prone position. Significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding the incidence of vocal fold immobility and laryngeal granuloma. Conclusion: Laryngeal complications were more common in the COVID-19 group than in the control group. Prone positioning may be a risk factor for these complications.

20,"At the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19 were classed as critical, requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.1,2 Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be highly effective for COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 is rare among individuals who have a complete vaccination record, with a severity rate is 0.015%.3 However, because of factors such as virus mutations, the number of infected individuals remains high, and there are still many patients at any one time with severe COVID-19 in Japan.4 COVID-19 causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in approximately 20% of hospitalized patients.2 Because prone positioning improves outcomes in patients with ARDS by reducing lung compression and improving lung perfusion, it has been widely used in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS.5,6 However, laryngeal complications, including vocal fold immobility, laryngeal/tracheal stenosis, and laryngeal granuloma after endotracheal intubation, have been reported after intubation and prone positioning in patients with COVID-19,7-13 and it has been suggested that prolonged intubation with prone positioning is associated with these laryngeal complications.7 However, little is known about the laryngeal complications that occur after intubation and prone positioning in patients with severe COVID-19.

In our study, the rate of UVFI after intubation was",1.0,COVID-19,True

CVD risk factors, including BMI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, did not differ between the two groups. The duration of intubation and the size of the endotracheal tube also did not differ between the two groups. Prone positioning was a factor that was significantly different between the two groups. It has been suggested that UVFI after endotracheal intubation is caused by recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis (RLNP) due to compressive neural injury or arytenoid dislocation/subluxation.14,20,21 It was difficult to differentiate between these two diseases because we did not perform laryngeal electromyography.

In our cohort, a shorter duration of intubation was associated with the incidence of laryngeal granulation in COVID-19 group.

The mechanism of laryngeal complications caused by prone positioning is unclear. Rotation of the neck during prone positioning may exacerbate the pressure on the larynx due to the endotracheal tube or may dislocate the endotracheal tube and cause arytenoid dislocation. In addition, disturbance of mucosal microcirculation and nerve injury because of SARS-CoV-2 are potential causes of UVFI. It has been reported that early intervention for patients with postintubation laryngeal injury is associated with a favorable outcome compared with late intervention.27 Otolaryngologists should be aware of these laryngeal complications after endotracheal intubation and prone positioning and should intervene earlier.",1.0,COVID-19,True

UVFI and laryngeal granulation can be treated conservatively, while laryngeal and tracheal stenosis require surgical procedures. Therefore, timely tracheostomy is important when intubation and prone positioning are prolonged.",1.0,COVID-19,True
111,"There are several limitations in this study that should be noted. First, this study was retrospective, and the number of included patients was small. In a power analysis comparing laryngeal complications between the COVID-19 group and the control group, the power (1 À ) was 0.58. In addition, the number of included patients was too small in which to perform other statistical tests such as multivariate regression. A larger-scale, prospective study will be needed to clarify our observations. Second, because we could not assess the larynx using a flexible endoscope in all patients in the COVID-19 group, there was a risk of bias that the patients were enriched for those with laryngeal pathologies, and thus there is a possibility that the patients with COVID-19 in our cohort were not necessarily representative of the general population. However, some patients could not be evaluated with this approach because they were transferred to another hospital or because there was a lack of testing equipment, and thus this was not related to their symptoms. We could also not assess the larynx in all patients in the control group; therefore, there was also a risk of bias in this group. However, most prolonged intubated patients underwent larynx evaluation by flexible endoscopy before oral intake. Third, we could not follow up all patients with UVFI or laryngeal granuloma. Further studies on the outcomes of UVFI and laryngeal granuloma after endotracheal intubation in patients with severe COVID-19 are needed. In addition, laryngeal and tracheal stenosis were not",1.0,COVID-19,True

Fourth, the influence of laryngeal inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown. In this cohort, all patients in the COVID-19 group were treated by prone positioning therapy, while only one patient in the control group was treated using prone positioning therapy. Comparisons between the COVID-19 group and the control group without prone positioning are required to investigate the influence of laryngeal inflammation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, because the proportion that required prone positioning differed between the COVID-19 group and control group, we should consider the possibility that systemic differences between COVID-19 and other diseases were involved.",1.0,flu,True
