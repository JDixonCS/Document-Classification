12,"Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with adverse clinical outcomes and high mortality in patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 is known to be bidirectional. Aim: To analyze the rate of new-onset diabetes in COVID-19 patients and assess the clinical outcomes of new-onset diabetes and hyperglycemia among COVID-19 patients Methods: This cross sectional study has enrolled those individuals admitted with COVID-19 and has newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. (DM; based on laboratory diagnoses). Results: Analysis showed that 13.7% (84/610) of COVID-19 patients had newly diagnosed DM. Majority of the newly diagnosed diabetic patient was male (58.3%), most of them (33.3%) were 51-60 year age group. Higher incidence of DM was reported in urban population (54.8%). The significant risk factors of diabetes were found family history of diabetes, (53.6%) and obesity (72.6%). Hypertension was the most common (61.7%) comorbidity associated with the DM. Conclusions: Diabetes diagnosed at COVID-19 presentation is associated with lower glucose but higher inflammatory markers and ICU admission, suggesting stress hyperglycemia as a major physiologic mechanism.",1.0,clinical,True

15,"Diabetes is a common chronic metabolic disease, and one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality, which leads to huge health and financial burden worldwide. Patients with diabetes have an increased risk of severe complications, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and multi-organ failure [1].
