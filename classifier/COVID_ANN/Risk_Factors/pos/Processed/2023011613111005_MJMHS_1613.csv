10,"Introduction: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with psychological distress following the COVID-19 pandemic among medical students at one of the public universities in Malaysia. Method: From August to October 2020, a web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate medical students at a public university. DASS-21, Brief Resilience Scale and WHOQOL-Bref questionnaires were used in this study. Results: The prevalence of depression was 40.5%, anxiety 46.0% and stress 30.9%. Based on multivariate logistic regression, a higher quality of life score is associated with a lower likelihood of depression (AOR,""0.583, p<0.001), anxiety (AOR"",""0.726, p<0.001), and stress, (AOR"",""0.702, p<0.001) respectively. Likewise, a higher resilience score is less likely to be associated with depression (AOR"",""0.880, p"",""0.002), anxiety (AOR"",""0.880, p"",""0.002), and stress (AOR"",""0.850, p<0.001). Older age (OR"",""0.700, p"",0.020) was associated with less stress and being on campus (OR,""3.436, p"",""0.021) was at risk of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Our results suggest that medical students with higher quality of life and resilience scores had less depression, anxiety and stress. Older age was associated with less stress, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, being on campus was at risk of stress. Various stakeholders need to keep these findings in mind and identify those who are at risk for developing depression, anxiety, and stress in order to take further action to improve their quality of life and resilience Malaysian Journal of Medicine and Health Sciences (2023) 19(1):31-39. doi:10.47836/mjmhs19.1.6""",1.0,COVID-19,True

There are evidences of high rates of medical students experiencing poor mental health (5, 6). However, the impact may differ due to unequal sociocultural, physical health, and family financial circumstances. Emotional resilience may affect the expression of detrimental mental health symptoms.

21,"On an individual level, some adults are more psychologically resilient than others. Therefore, their vulnerability to mental health crises varies (7). Resilience is an indication of positive mental health; where resilience is described as a person's ability to remain healthy and adapt to life's challenges after exposure to an adverse event (8). Resilience relies on functioning, supportive and meaningful social networks and positive attachments (9). Several studies have reported that resilience plays either a mediating or a protective role, cushioning the impact of mental health problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including psychological distress and poor quality of life (10-13).",1.0,positive,True

Cao et al reported a significant prevalence of the psychological effects of COVID-19 among medical students, affecting 24.9% of the 7143 medical students in China (14). As future medical professionals, such adverse effects will affect these students' careers and their ability to provide better medical care to patients. High level of psychological anxiety or stress will also reduce academic performance (15). Symptoms of anxiety and depression are also the main denominators associated with suicidal ideation in medical students (16).

176,"This study reported that more than two-fifths of medical students (40.5%) suffered from depressive symptoms. Our finding therefore reported a lower prevalence of depression as compared to a recent study in which the prevalence of depression among medical students in Egypt during a pandemic was 75.2%(24). However, this prevalence was higher than in other studies from Indonesia (18.6%) (25), the United States (24.3%) (26), China (9.6%-31.9%) (27, 28) and India (10.8%-33.2%) (29, 30). The prevalence of depressive symptoms varied from study to study and this may be due to different populations and study locations. This study also reported that medical students who were more resilient were less prone to depression. This is consistent with another study that reported that resilience was negatively associated with depression (31). A possible explanation could be that those who are more resilient are able to adapt to the online learning method, even though the university workload has increased after the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, they are less worried or depressed about not being able to successfully complete the academic year successfully due to the COVID-19 pandemic (32). Medical students with a good quality of life are also less likely to develop depression (33). This is consistent with another study that reported that quality of life was negatively associated with depression. A possible explanation could be that people with better quality of life are less afraid of COVID-19 and at the same time their family member is not severely affected by COVID-19 (33), but these variables were not examined in this study.

The literature also reports that medical students with underlying depression also tend to underperform in their undergraduate studies, have higher dropout rates, and also exhibit long-term impairments in their work performance and career development (35). Therefore, medical schools and public health officials should closely monitor outcomes and engage those at risk of depression in activities to improve psychological resilience and quality of life.",1.0,,True
290,"Our study showed that 46% of the medical students experienced symptoms of anxiety. This prevalence is similar to another study in Indonesia (47.8%) (25) but relatively higher than a study among university students in Malaysia at 29.8% (36). However, compared to values from another study conducted in Turkey (62.5%), the results were significantly lower (37). The determinants of anxiety found in this study were psychological resilience and quality of life and the possible explanation was outlined above. These results differed from a study conducted in Turkey because the presence of chronic diseases was associated with a higher prevalence of anxiety. (37) Increased anxiety has been associated with families of students having a lower household incomes (37), being left alone (36), and again, which was not found to be associated with anxiety in this study.",1.0,disease,True
291,"Our study showed that 30.9% of the medical students suffered from stress symptoms. This prevalence is lower than in another study in Indonesia (44.6%) (25). Our study showed that 30.9% of the medical students suffered from stress symptoms. This finding is lower than in a study in Indonesia (44.6%) (25) but higher than the ones conducted at Wannan Medical College in Anhui Province, China (14.6%) (28), at Shri M. P. Shah Government Medical College in India (15.6%) (30) and a medical college for treatment of COVID-19 in India (20.7%) (29). Our study showed that older students (OR,""0.700, p"",""0.020) experienced less stress. The likelihood of increased stress among the younger participants could be due to the timing of data collection, which coincided with the first-year students preparing for the examination amid the era of this global pandemic. Another explanation could be that older students had a better knowledge about COVID-19, and its prevention measures than the younger ones, which may additionally protect them from unjustified fear of COVID-19 infection (38). Older students tend to be more health literate in accessing and evaluating healthrelated information from reliable scientific sources, although young medical students may rely more heavily on social media to gather any information (38). In this study, medical students who stayed in campus were more likely to be affected by stress than those who stayed at home. Social isolation on campus due to the movement control order and a lack of direct family support may explain such important findings (39). The results point to the central role of family and social""",1.0,COVID-19,True
292,"support in reducing the risk of psychological distress among students (40, 41). Those who stayed at home during the pandemic were likely to receive support from parents and siblings, which has been shown to reduce the likelihood of psychological distress (40-42). Other stressors that may have impacted the psychological well-being of university students (including medical students) during the pandemic include financial constraints (personal or family), the more demanding expectations of distance learning, and the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, and concerns about the future employment status (36, 43, 44).",1.0,pandemic,True
293,"In this study, better quality of life was associated with a lower likelihood of stress. Sleep-wake cycle patterns and eating habits can change significantly during a pandemic, and may affect the mental well-being (37, 43). One study showed that exercise can promote better sleep efficiency and duration (45), and a specific diet can lead to shorter sleep duration and a poorer sleep quality (46). Exercise that can be done indoors, and a healthy diet improves mental health, which should be recommended for people, including the medical students, who find themselves socially isolated during lockdowns (43, 47). Other strategies for maintaining a healthy state of mind included remote chatting and hobbies such as indoor exercise, reading books or magazines, and also gardening. (44). Villanueva EW et al. reported that better quality of life resulted from a greater life resilience (43). In this study, a higher resilience score was associated with a lower risk of stress among the medical students. Young adults with high levels of resilience are less likely to suffer from mental health problems, interpersonal conflicts, behavioral problems, and poor academic performance than those with a low level of resilience (48).",1.0,pandemic,True
294,"This study showed that the mental health of medical students is deteriorating during the pandemic. In the postMCO era and subsequently living with the COVID-19 infection, the findings serve to alert the medical school leaders, educators, and the medical community to create a better support system for the cohort of medical students who are vulnerable to be significantly affected by the pandemic. Medical curriculum developers should be aware and implement measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the well-being of medical students. In particular, the current assessment modalities should be tailored to address the nuances and challenges faced by medical students during their clinical training in the midst of this pandemic.",1.0,pandemic,True

Those who stayed on campus experienced more stress than those who stayed at home.
