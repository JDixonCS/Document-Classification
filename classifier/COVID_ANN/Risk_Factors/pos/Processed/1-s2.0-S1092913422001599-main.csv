9,"Pre-existing Alzheimer's disease is a risk factor for severe/fatal COVID-19 and infection by SARS-CoV2 virus has been associated with an increased incidence of un-masked Alzheimer's disease. The molecular basis whereby SARS-CoV2 may amplify Alzheimer's disease is not well understood. This study analyzed the molecular changes in autopsy brain tissues from people with pre-existing dementia who died of COVID-19 (n , 5) which was compared to equivalent tissues of people who died of COVID-19 with no history of dementia (n ,"" 8), Alzheimer's disease pre-COVID-19 (n "", 10) and aged matched controls (n ,"" 10) in a blinded fashion. Immunohistochemistry analyses for hyperphosphorylated tau protein, -synuclein, and -amyloid-42 confirmed the diagnoses of Alz­ heimer's disease (n "","" 4), and Lewy body dementia (n "","" 1) in the COVID-19 group. The brain tissues from patients who died of COVID-19 with no history of dementia showed a diffuse microangiopathy marked by endocytosis of spike subunit S1 and S2 in primarily CD31+ endothelia with strong co-localization with ACE2, Caspase-3, IL6, TNF, and Complement component 6 that was not associated with SARS-CoV2 RNA. Microglial activation marked by increased TMEM119 and MCP1 protein expression closely paralleled the endocytosed spike protein. The COVID-19 tissues from people with no pre-existing dementia showed, compared to controls, 5-10× fold increases in expression of neuronal NOS and NMDAR2 as well as a marked decrease in the expression of proteins whose loss is associated with worsening Alzheimer's disease: MFSD2a, SHIP1, BCL6, BCL10, and BACH1. In COVID-19 tissues from people with dementia the widespread spike-induced microencephalitis with the concomitant microglial activation co-existed in the same areas where neurons had hyperphosphorylated tau protein suggesting that the already dysfunctional neurons were additionally stressed by the SARS-CoV2 induced microangiopathy. ACE2+ human brain endothelial cells treated with high dose (but not vaccine equivalent low dose) spike S1 protein demonstrated each of the molecular changes noted in the in vivo COVID-19 and COVID19/Alzheimer's disease brain tissues. It is concluded that fatal COVID-19 induces a diffuse microencephalitis and microglial activation in the brain due to endocytosis of circulating viral spike protein that amplifies pre-existing dementia in at least two ways: 1) modulates the expression of proteins that may worsen Alzheimer's disease and 2) stresses the already dysfunctional neurons by causing an acute proinflammatory/hypercoagulable/hypoxic microenvironment in areas with abundant hyperphosphorylated tau protein and/or A-42.""",1.0,disease,True

19,"was responsible for non-pulmonary manifestations of severe COVID-19, it is now clear that infectious virus is rarely identified in the blood or organs besides the lung or nasopharyx [7-10]. Indeed, many in­ vestigators have documented that SARS-CoV2 spike protein per se, either in vitro, or in vivo in mouse models, can elicit the cytokine storm and direct CNS and cardiac damage typical of severe COVID-19 [11-19]. Importantly circulating levels of spike protein post vaccination (50-200 pg/ml) are not associated with disease in these models [20]. Rather spike protein levels of 20,000 to 30,000 pg/ml, as have been found in the sera of people with severe COVID-19 [14], are associated with severe disease in these in vitro and in vivo models. The source of such high circulating levels of SARS-CoV2 spike protein likely is the degeneration of the extremely high viral load in the lung due to the widespread complement mediated microangiopathy [7,21].",1.0,COVID-19,True
20,"It is well documented that there are strong links between Alzheimer's disease and COVID-19 [22-29]. COVID-19 can unmask pre-clinical de­ mentia and people with pre-existing Alzheimer's disease are more likely to get severe COVID-19. The molecular bases of these strong clinical correlates are not well understood. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) have each been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. nNOS is overexpressed in GABA producing neurons in Alzheimer's disease which has, in in vitro models of the disease, led to increased neuronal death and, in turn, increased NMDAR-based excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmis­ sion [30-34]. The latter has also been associated with neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease. The reduction of other proteins, including Src ho­ mology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHIP1) [35,36], BTB Domain And CNC Homolog 1 (BACH1) [37,38], BCL6 Transcription Repressor (BCL6) [39], BCL10 Immune Signaling Adaptor (BCL10) [40,41], and Major Facilitator Superfamily Domain Containing 2A (MFSD2A) [42,43], have each been linked to progressive Alzheimer's dis­ ease. It has been shown in in vivo mouse models of COVID-19 that high circulating levels of spike protein can modulate some of these proteins in the brain and we have previously reported altered expression of NMDAR2, nNOS, SHIP1, and MFSD2A in the brains of people who died of COVID-19 who did not have a history of pre-existing dementia [11].",1.0,disease,True
21,"Another clinical link between Alzheimer's disease and COVID-19 is that obesity and type II diabetes have been associated with each disease [1,2]. It has been postulated that the pro-inflammatory state charac­ teristic of each disease, including increased IL6 expression, may be one of the molecular links [44]. Also, obesity has been associated with increased ACE2 and Furin expression, each of which may facilitate spike protein cell entry [26,45,46]. Further, the hypercoagulable state, both in terms of microthrombi and large vessel thrombi, have been extensively reported in both severe COVID-1 and obesity [21,47].",1.0,clinical,True
22,The purpose of this study was to examine brain tissues from 13 people who either died of COVID-19 with no evidence of dementia or had pre-existing dementia and compare the molecular/histologic/viral findings in a blinded fashion to 10 pre-COVID normal controls and 10 pre-COVID-19 Alzheimer's disease to better define the mechanism(s) whereby SARS-CoV2 can induce or amplify the brain disease in people with pre-existing dementia.

Although there was a tendency for higher spike/cytokine density in the hyperphosphorylated tau protein + areas, it did not reach statistical significance (spike density in areas that stained positive for hyper­ phosphorylated tau protein was 25.5 % of microvessels with SEM of 5.1 versus 22.9 % of microvessels with SEM of 6.1 in sections with minimal hyperphosphorylated tau protein).

92,"A central question in the central nervous system (CNS) manifesta­ tions of COVID-19 is the molecular basis of the disease. Although it is logical to assume there is more than one molecular mechanism, it was initially hypothesized that systemic spread of SARS-CoV2 infection from the lung and nasopharynx to the brain was the primary mechanism. However, many studies have documented that SARS-CoV2 RNA is rarely found in the bloodstream even in fatal COVID-19 and, importantly, the viral RNA is not detected in the brain in such cases [7-10]. As examples, qRT-PCR assays failed to detect SARS-CoV2 RNA in the CSF of COVID-19 patients with neurological complications [51], and a larger study also indicated that viral RNA was not present in the brain in fatal COVID-19 cases, despite the widespread microvascular damage [52]. A key dis­ covery in understanding the pathogenesis of CNS disease in COVID-19",1.0,COVID-19,True
93,"was the demonstration by many groups, including ours, that spike protein per se when injected into mice or when incubated in vitro with different cell cultures can recapitulate the main pathologic and molec­ ular findings in the brain/brain cells in fatal COVID-19 before any antibody response can be mounted [11-19]. The data in this paper supports the hypothesis that the endocytosis of circulating spike protein in the ACE-2-expressing endothelial cells of microvessels in the CNS plays a major role in the CNS disease of COVID-19. This is not to say that other factors, such as the cytokine storm and antibody-antigen com­ plexes in the microvessels, do not also play a role. However, it is now clear that endocytosed spike protein in the microvessels of the CNS or in vitro can induce the pro-inflammatory microenvironment and hyperco­ agulable state well described in the brain for fatal COVID-19 before a systemic cytokine storm or antibody response would be mounted [12,15,17].",1.0,COVID-19,True
94,"The source of the circulating spike protein is logically the naso­ pharynx [53] and, more probably, the lung since the microangiopathy described in the latter [21] leads to marked viral degeneration which could release high concentrations of the spike protein into the circula­ tion. An important finding in this study is that these levels of circulating spike protein induce the same molecular damage in the human brain endothelial cells in vitro. Importantly, however, the spike levels associ­ ated with the mRNA vaccines, where the circulating amounts have been reported to be 100-200 pg/ml [20], did not induce any significant molecular changes in the HBEC, underscoring the safety of the vaccine. An interesting part of this study, which corroborated work by others, is that the primary cell type responding to the microangiopathy in the brain is the endogenous microglia cell and, as shown by others, astro­ cytes [7,8,52] and not exogenous inflammatory cells entering the CNS. This immunologically ""protected"" status of the CNS has been well described and also reported at other sites, such as the placenta [49]. The microglial activation data in this regard was interesting. As shown in a recent report, microglial activation is a prominent feature of the path­ ophysiology of COVID-19 brain disease [52]. MCP1 is reported to be a specific marker of microglial activation [54-56]. Although we did note increased MCP1 expression in the brain tissues in all COVID-19 cases relative to the controls, both neurons as well as microglia expressed this protein. MCP1 expression in neurons has been associated with neuronal damage in many diseases including ALS, viral infections, and Alz­ heimer's disease [54-56]. Thus, the MCP1 expression in neurons in the COVID-19 brain tissues is consistent with indirect neuronal damage",1.0,vaccine,True

100,"COVID-19 is well documented, including the observation that people with minimal cognitive disorder may develop Alzheimer's disease after contracting COVID-19 [22-29]. The data in this paper offers possible in vivo molecular mechanisms that may explain this clinical correlation. First, the diffuse microencephalitis involves areas where hyper­ phosphorylated tau protein is prominent. Thus, the dysfunctional neu­ rons in these areas will be additionally stressed by the strong proinflammatory and hypercoagulable state given the importance of the microvasculature unit to neuronal functioning. Second, COVID-19 brain-associated molecular changes included the reduced expression of proteins that has been implicated to worsening Alzheimer's disease. These include BCL6, BCL10, BACH1, SHIP 1 and, importantly, MFSD2A. Reduction of the latter protein, a key player in the blood brain barrier, has been proposed as a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease per se even in the absence of COVID-19 [42]. BCL6, BACH1, SHIP1, and BCL10 were chosen for study as each are targets of miR-155, which we have shown is increased in the cells after the endocytosis of SARS-CoV2 spike protein [9]. Further, though miR-155 is not dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease, there was a relative decrease in BCL6 and BCL10 in the Alzheimer's disease brains versus controls [57] although the decrease was more pronounced in the COVID-19 brain tissues. Proteins such as nNOS and NMDAR2 have been shown to play a direct role in the neuronal dysfunction typical of Alzheimer's disease [30-34] and, as we showed previously, these are also increased in fatal COVID-19 in the brain [7] though in this study we confirmed that these observations also were observed in the brain of people who died of COVID-19 with pre-existing Alzheimer's disease and that these proteins show a strong co-localization with spike protein.",1.0,COVID-19,True
101,"The increased Furin expression in fatal COVID-19 is interesting and also was seen in the fatal COVID cases with pre-existing Alzheimer's disease. Furin is involved in spike cleavage, and thus, it may facilitate spike endocytosis in the endothelia of the microvessels where both S1 and S2 were detected. With regards to ACE-2, it was not surprising that it was much more highly expressed in the microvessels of the brains of people who had pre-existing obesity versus people without obesity given that other investigators have documented this result [58,59].

103,"A key study by Lee et al documented that microvascular disease, microthrombi, complement deposition, microglial activation, and endothelial cell damage are essential features of brain damage in COVID-19. Critically, these data were not associated with viral RNA [52]. The results in this study are consistent with their data although they ascribe the changes to antigen-antibody complexes or autoanti­ bodies whereas this study demonstrated that these findings strongly colocalized with endocytosed spike protein. Antigen-antibody com­ plexes typically involve a neutrophil-based response with joint and/or renal involvement [7,60]. A large study of auto-antibody encephalitis demonstrated a strong CD3 (93 % of cases) and CD20 response (67 % of cases) and it involved the parenchyma, and not the perivascular area, in 29 % of cases which is not consistent with the pathology findings in the brain in fatal COVID-19 [61].

105,"The main conclusion of this work that analyzed molecular differ­ ences in the brain of COVID-19 patients including those with dementia is that the endocytosis of SARS-CoV2 spike protein may be a major factor in the CNS disease associated with COVID-19, including long-haul COVID-19. CNS disease in fatal COVID-19 is marked by a dramatic endocytosis of spike protein in the microvascular ACE2+ endothelia and, if one assumes it may persist for months if the disease is not fatal, may also explain long-haul COVID-19. These data suggest that blocking the endocytosis of the spike protein by endothelial cells using antibodies directed against spike may be an effective way of reducing the severity of neurological complications in COVID-19 patients. Once the spike protein has been endocytosed, it is clear that many deleterious pathways are activated which in sum would be difficult to abrogate. The data also offer a likely explanation as to why pre-existing Alzheimer's disease is a risk factor for severe/fatal COVID-19 and why the infection by SARSCoV-2 is associated with an increased incidence of Alzheimer's dis­ ease.
