10,"Introduction: Arbaeen is a religious ceremony held annually with the participation of a large number of pilgrims. During the pandemic of Covid-19, a mass gathering of Arbaeen pilgrims can strengthen the transmission of this disease and put more pressure on the health care system of countries. The aim of the study is to evaluate the risk of Arbaeen ceremony in the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021. Materials and methods: A mixed method was performed to perform the study using qualitative and quantitative methods. A national risk assessment tool was used that consisted of hazard identification and assessment, scenario development, exposure assessment, vulnerability assessment and risk estimation. The national risk assessment tool was completed through a focused group discussion and the opinions of 20 representatives of the health system and the level of risks were estimated. Data were collected, analyzed, and integrated by the research team. Results: Based on the results of risk matrix analysis, factors such as the increase in the number of new cases of COVID-19, the probability of exposure to a new variant of COVID-19, the probability of arrival of a new variant of COVID-19 to the country, the probability of increasing referrals to healthcare facilities (score 16), the probability of getting respiratory diseases, and the environmental contamination (score 12) occupied the red area of the matrix and were found to have the highest risk (unbearable risk), that needs immediate action. Conclusion: Preparing for a mass gathering such as Arbaeen is very important in order to reduce the risk of communicable disease, and the first step in improving preparedness is risk assessment and its continuity in the various stages of the ceremony. Therefore, policy makers and planners of such events should conduct risk assessments with the participation of local and national public health authorities regularly.",1.0,pandemic,True

12,"The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mass gatherings as the gathering of a certain number of people in a specific place, for a specific purpose in a specific period, so that communities need more effort and double planning and action to provide services and responses [1]. Arbaeen is a religious ceremony held annually in Iraq with the participation of 17-20 million people from many countries of the world [2], and the gathering place is in Iraq for about two weeks. Pilgrims from different countries such as Iran, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, the Republic of Azerbaijan, Turkey, Lebanon, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, etc. are present in this ceremony, and they walk to the city of Karbala, south of Baghdad, to gather at the end of the 40-days following Ashura, for the commemoration of the martyrdom of the third Shia Muslim Imam, Hossein ibn Ali's. The mourning ceremony of Arbaeen is the world's largest public mass gathering.",0.0,,False
13,"In Arbaeen, due to the large population of pilgrims' journey and Variability of the time of the ceremony, public health managers must be prepared to manage the excess pressures on the country's health system [3]. On the other hand, ensuring the safety and health of the participants in this event is one of the most important parameters in successful mass gatherings management [4]. In this type of ceremony, which participants attend from different nations, regions, and cultures, the exposure, occurrence, and spread of infectious diseases is very important and varies depending on the type and location of mass gathering [5]. People attending the Arbaeen event may be threatened by communicable diseases such as water & food borne diseases, injuries, terrorism, and bioterrorism, in addition, noncommunicable diseases and accidents are worrying [6].",1.0,spread,True

18,"puts more pressure on the health care system of countries [1]. On the other hand, participants in the Arbaeen ceremony may not believe in the health risks of this religious ceremony. Therefore, the mass gathering of Arbaeen and its related effects is considered a serious threat to health, and ignoring this issue can have unfortunate health consequences [8,9], and it is necessary to take preparedness measures to manage and control infectious diseases such as Covid-19. Since understanding the risks associated with mass gatherings is the first step in policy-making and planning for public health managers, it is necessary to consider the potential risks before the ceremony according to the type of ceremony, the number of participants, time, and place, hence the risk reduction is possible through effective planning [10].",1.0,infectious,True

Available data included the number of cases, deaths, recovered ones, the ratio of death to the total number of patients, and demographic characteristics. To predict the amount of exposure, we needed a foresight scenarios.

Participants included 20 key individuals who were representatives of different departments of the Ministry of Health, the Deputy of Treatment, the Deputy of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Emergency Medical Service organization, and the universities of medical sciences in the border provinces.

89,"The results of the risk assessment of Arbaeen ceremony during the Covid-19 pandemic showed that holding the ceremony in the form of a caravan and completely controlled and with regard to health protocols can reduce the risk of disease. On the other hand, limited resources and equipment, fatigue, and burnout of manpower have created conditions for health systems that holding ceremonies in a limited and controlled manner can reduce the risk of increasing in new cases and demand for receiving health services, and can prevent the increase of the burden of disease on health systems [15]. Therefore, in line with other studies, the results of the present study emphasize preventive measures taken by health systems such as supply and distribution of COVID-19 diagnostic tests, mandatory submission of negative PCR test results, the need for vaccination, and continuous monitoring of pilgrims in terms of getting COVID-19 [2].",1.0,pandemic,True

Also, performing some religious customs such as shaking hands after prayers, touching and kissing holy places in shrines, washing graves by hands, using common prayer tools such as Mohr, Beads, Mat, and praying chador, and distributing food as charity should be abolished [13]. Standard hygiene measures depend on available resources and how protective equipment is used, therefore, health education are very important [2]. Therefore, educational planning as one of the important programs of the preparedness phase should be done before holding the Arbaeen ceremony, taking into account the educational content and target groups [18]. In this regard, the result of this study showed that In line with the principles of risk communication, the training should be understandable to the audience to be observed its impact on people's behavior. Another way to encourage people to comply with health requirements is to use the capacity of religious leaders. Religious missionaries according to their mission can strengthen people's morale, manage stress and promote adherence to hygienic principles by creating hope, inner peace and increasing acceptance [13].",1.0,personal,True
92,"The results of the study showed that environmental contamination due to improper collection and disposal of waste and poor condition of toilets is one of the public health risks in mass gatherings [19]. For this purpose, it is necessary to develop health protocols and guides for the health of pilgrims which focus on environmental health requirements in food distribution places and resting places, disinfection of places and surfaces exposed to pilgrims, sanitary disposal of waste to be considered by environmental health experts and supervisors. Natural and proper ventilation of the shrines, resorts and food distribution areas, and toilets by opening windows, doors, and entrances of spaces, and planning to observe physical distancing in these places are other important issues that should be considered [2]. Based on the results of the risk assessment in present study, the possibility of getting water- & food-borne diseases is another related risk in holding the Arbaeen ceremony during the Covid19 pandemic. The results of studies have shown that the safety and health of food, drink, and water are important public health challenges in the Arbaeen ceremony.
