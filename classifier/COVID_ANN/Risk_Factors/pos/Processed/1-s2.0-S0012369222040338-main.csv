Study Design and Methods: This observational cohort study included non-hospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from November 2020-October 2021, using electronic health records from a statewide health system plus state-level vaccine and mortality data. Using propensity matching, we selected approximately 2.5 patients not receiving mAbs for each patient who received mAb treatment under emergency use authorization. The primary outcome was 28day hospitalization; secondary outcomes included mortality and hospitalization severity. Results: Of 36,077 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2,675 receiving mAbs were matched to 6,677 not receiving mAbs. Compared to mAb-untreated patients, mAb-treated patients had lower all-cause hospitalization (4.0% vs 7.7%; adjusted OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.38-0.60) and all-cause mortality (0.1% vs. 0.9%; adjusted OR 0.11, 95%CI 0.03-0.29) to day 28; differences persisted to day 90. Among hospitalized patients, mAb-treated patients had shorter hospital length of stay (5.8 vs. 8.5 days) and lower risk of mechanical ventilation (4.6% vs. 16.6%). Results were similar for preventing hospitalizations during the Delta variant phase (adjusted OR 0.35, 95%CI 0.25-0.50) and across subgroups. Number-needed-to-treat (NNT) to prevent hospitalization was lower for subgroups with higher baseline risk of hospitalization--e.g., multiple comorbidities (NNT,17) and not fully vaccinated (NNT,24) vs. no comorbidities (NNT,88) and fully vaccinated (NNT,81).",1.0,pandemic,True

The mean time from positive SARS-CoV-2 test to receipt of mAb treatment was 3.7 days (SD 2.5).

Overall, severity of hospitalization was lower across the illness continuum for mAb-treated patients (Figure 2). Subgroup Analyses The relative benefit of mAb therapy on reducing 28-day hospital admissions among key demographic and clinical subgroups was broadly similar across all subgroups (Figure 3). Of note, the association between mAb treatment and prevention of hospitalizations was at least as high during the Delta phase (OR 0.35; 95%CI: 0.25-0.50), compared to the Alpha phase (OR 0.67; 95%CI: 0.46-0.98).

78,"There have also been critical gaps in understanding the effects of mAbs on important subgroups of patients, such as those with older age, comorbid conditions, and prior SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. With our large sample size, we demonstrated clinical benefits of mAb administration among virtually all subgroups examined, with similar relative benefits in terms of reduced odds of hospitalizations across all subgroups. These subgroup findings highlight the need to interpret relative benefits in light of highly variable absolute hospitalization rates, because the NNT to avert one hospitalization depends on both mAb effectiveness and baseline rates of hospitalization. For example, we found a similar relative effect size for vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, but the NNT to avert one hospitalization among unvaccinated patients is 24, while the NNT for vaccinated patients is 81. These results are of practical importance for policymakers and clinicians because there have been shortages of mAb supplies and infusion capacity.11,12 Specifically, our findings suggest the most efficient use of limited mAb infusion capacity to alleviate strain on hospitals is to preferentially administer mAbs to patients at highest baseline risk for hospitalization, including those who are older, not fully vaccinated, or with multiple comorbid conditions. Notably, 28-day hospitalization among mAb-treated but not fully vaccinated patients was almost 3-fold higher (5.2%) than for mAb-treated patients who were",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

81,Journal Pre-proof This study has several limitations. The setting was a single health system; while large and,0.0,,False
82,"representing both urban and rural settings and community and academic hospitals, it is geographically limited to one US state. Our sample had relatively low racial and ethnic minority representation, limiting our ability to detect differences across these key subgroups. While we used statewide data for mortality and vaccination status, hospitalizations were collected only within this single health system. If mAb-untreated patients were also less likely to be seen in the health system for other services (hence, more likely to be hospitalized elsewhere), this may bias our results toward the null. We also relied on EHR data, including manual chart reviews, which may have missing or inaccurate information about the presence of chronic conditions.21 These factors might have limited our ability to detect the impact of mAb treatment, especially between subgroups. Our EHR data does not contain information on SARS-CoV-2 variants at the patient level, so variant phases are presented chronologically. However, during Colorado's Delta phase more than 99% of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 was Delta variant.22 Our large sample size allowed the detection of meaningful benefits of mAb therapy for most subgroups, but the study could not detect potentially relevant differences between subgroups.

To preserve sample size, the variables race and ethnicity were combined and categorized into non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other. In the subgroup analysis race/ethnicity is binarized into non-Hispanic white and other to allow for a large enough sample size for subgroup analyses. Continuous body mass index (BMI in kg/m2) was categorized into 4 categories: underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9), obese (30.0). The number of comorbid medical conditions was calculated using obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, pulmonary disease, and renal disease, and was categorized into none, one, or two or more. Immunocompromised status was categorized separately. All individual comorbid conditions were considered as binary variables with either evidence of the comorbid condition or no evidence of the comorbid condition in the EHR.
