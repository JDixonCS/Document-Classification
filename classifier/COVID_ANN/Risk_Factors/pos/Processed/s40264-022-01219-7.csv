Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study in the pediatric ward IV at Ibn Sina Children's Hospital in Rabat (HER) with children treated for chronic rheumatic and inflammatory diseases for the period from February 2021 to June 2021. Data collection was carried using an excel datasheet from the pediatric department register, the record of pediatric rheumatology consultations and patient records. The data extracted concerned the socio-demographic data of patients, also the evolution of pathology, effectiveness of biotherapy used based on Giannini score.

56,"Introduction: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are novel biological agents with proven efficacy for several types of cancers. However, ICIs have also been associated with the onset of cardiac immune-related adverse events, which are rare but associated with high morbidity and mortality [1,2]. Moreover, these events are highly arrhythmogenic despite their related clinical manifestations are still poorly understood [3]. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias related to ICIs by analyzing European Pharmacovigilance data. Methods: Individual case safety reports (ICSRs) on ICI-associated cardiac arrhythmias were retrieved from the website of suspected adverse drug reactions of the European pharmacovigilance database (Eudravigilance), available at www.adrreports.eu. Data were retrieved from the date of the marketing authorization of each ICI (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, ipilimumab, durvalumab, avelumab, cemiplimab, and dostarlimab) to 30 April 2022. ICSRs were classified based on the ICI. If more than one ICI was reported, the ICSR was classified as a combination of ICIs. To assess the reporting frequency of cardiac arrhythmias for each ICI/combination of ICIs compared to all other ICIs, the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were computed. The RORs and 95% CI were also computed for comparing ICIs' drug classes: antiPD1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, cemiplimab, dostarlimab), antiPDL1 (atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab), and anti-CTLA4 (ipilimumab). Finally, RORs and 95% CI were computed for the three most reported events of cardiac arrhythmias. Results: A total of 1,262 ICSRs related to an ICI and an event of cardiac arrhythmia were retrieved from Eudravigilance, of which 147 (11.6%) were related to combinations of ICIs. The most reported combination was nivolumab/ipilimumab (N , 140; 95.2%). The three most reported single ICIs were pembrolizumab (N ,"" 456; 36.1%), nivolumab (N "","" 433; 34.3%), and atezolizumab (N "","" 74; 5.9%). A total of 1,426 events of cardiac arrhythmias were identified, of which 1,187 were serious (83.2%) and 429 had a fatal outcome (30.1%). The three most reported events were atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, and cardiac arrest. The ROR of ipilimumab was compared to all other ICIs was 0.71 (95% CI 0.55-0.92; p "","" 0.009). In the comparison between ICIs' drug classes, anti-PD1 were associated with a higher reporting frequency of cardiac arrhythmias compared to anti-CTLA4 (ROR 1.47, 95% CI 1.14-1.90; p "","" 0.003). In the analyses of the three most reported events, no statistically significant difference was observed for all comparisons. Conclusion: The anti-CTLA4 ipilimumab was the only ICI associated with a reduced reporting frequency of cardiac arrhythmias. Further specific high-quality studies are needed on this topic.

66,"Introduction: A medicine is considered potentially inappropriate (PIM) when the potential risk of it in the older population exceeds the potential benefit, and for which there are safer alternatives [1]. This is highly prevalent in their medication therapy [1,2], enhancing adverse reactions. PIM are already identified from various tools developed, being the most common ones the explicit Beers criteria [3], the START/STOPP, which requires additional patient data [4] and in Europe the EU-7-PIM list [5]. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify suspected medicines classified as PIM in the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) reports received by the Portuguese Pharmacovigilance System of the National Authority of Medicines and Health Products (INFARMED, I.P.) in older adults, analysing in dept the reports including PIM as suspected medication. Methods: A retrospective study was designed including all ADR reports received by INFARMED, IP., between January and December 2019 in 65 and more year-old patients. ADR were characterized according with MedDRA System Organs Classes (SOC), seriousness, and medication according with the Anatomical Therapeutical Classification. PIM were identified in the report's suspected medication applying the operationalization for the Portuguese reality of the EU (7) PIM list [5] as well as the Beers criteria from 2019 [3]. Results: Beers and EU (7) PIM criteria were applied in 2337 reports. PIM were found in 299 (12,8%). From the 3170 suspected medicines identified, 337 (10.6%) were classified as PIM. From the 299 reports including PIM as suspected medication, the population showed a mean age of 73.0 ± 6.6 years, being 56.5% (n , 169) female. 45.2% (n ,"" 135) were reported by physicians. 71,4% (n "","" 215) of the reports were classified as serious, and hospitalization was the most common seriousness criteria identified (35.1%/n "","" 105). ``Nervous System disorders'' was the most common SOC criteria reported (49,1%/ n "", 147). Amiodarone (C01BD01) was the most frequent PIM identified by the criteria (n ,"" 34/10.1%), followed by dabigatran""",1.0,,True
67,"etexilat (B01AE07), (7.1%/n , 24) and Rivaroxaban (B01AF01) (6.2%/n , 21). Reports including PIM in suspected medicines had a significant higher number of ADR (p , 0.025) and number of suspected medicines per report (p \ 0.001). Seriousness of the ADR report classification (p ,"" 0.005) and hospitalization (p \ 0.001) were more associated in reports including PIM. Conclusion: These results reinforce the importance of improving medication appropriateness in older adults and promote the development and use of clinical decision support systems to avoid inappropriate prescriptions and, therefore, severe adverse reactions.

Objective: Aim of this study is to describe medication errors and identify causes of medication errors in children and adolescents spontaneously reported to HALMED, in order to propose and implement appropriate risk minimisation measures. Methods: We performed a search of HALMED's adverse drug reaction database using Standardised MedDRA Query (SMQ): Medication errors (Broad) with data lock point April 30th 2022. Cases in which medication errors occurred in patients up to 18 years of age were analysed according to the patient's age and gender, Preferred Terms (PTs) reported and root causes of medication errors. Results: Out of 8603 cases in patients up to 18 years of age, 1684 cases included terms pertaining to SMQ: Medication errors (Broad). Medication errors were most frequently reported for male patients (54%) and in the age group 2-11 years (67%). The most commonly reported PTs for medication errors were Accidental exposure to product by child (65%) and Accidental overdose (19%).

Identified root causes for medication errors were the following: misinterpretation of prescribed dosage due to very small volume resulting in 10 times higher administered dose (e.g. 3 ml instead of 0.3 ml) for salbutamol; confusion between units millilitres and milligrams resulting in overdose for paracetamol; interchange between medicinal products due to primary package similarities resulting in overdose for cholecalciferol (e.g. swapping with simethicone, dimetindene, bromhexidine); interchange between oral solution and syrup resulting in overdose for valproate. Conclusion: Medication errors were reported in 20% of all cases in patients up to 18 years of age, which highlights the importance of medication errors prevention in children and adolescents. Review of root causes for medication errors led to implementation of further risk minimisation measures, namely notifications for healthcare professionals (salbutamol and valproate), additional risk minimisation measures i.e. poster and dosage card (paracetamol) and workshops for healthcare professionals (salbutamol, valproate, paracetamol, cholecalciferol).

87,"Introduction: Digital features such as videos and infographics are used to make scientific literature more understandable and accessible to a wider audience [1, 2]. Plain language summaries and graphical abstracts are fast becoming the norm in complementing scientific publications across disciplines, including pharmacovigilance. However, the use of video explainers is limited, and the usefulness of such features is not well known. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of an animated explainer video in communicating a statistical method in pharmacovigilance. Methods: An animated explainer video [3] previously created to complement an earlier scientific publication [4] and improve communication of UMC's novel clustering method vigiGroup was used as a digital feature in this study. Communication specialists and data scientists collaborated to create the video, focusing on identifying key elements of the method and how to best illustrate its application in a visual narrative. A survey of 10 multiple choice and rating scale questions was used to assess comprehension, perceived effectiveness",1.0,cluster,True
88,"of communication, enjoyment, and desire to learn more. The survey was disseminated across 3 of UMC's social media channels (approx. 50,000 followers), including Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, to an audience of predominantly pharmacovigilance professionals. Subsequently, responses were collected and analysed. Results: Fifty-four individuals from 30 countries participated in the survey. Forty-four (81%) of the participants worked in a pharmacovigilance-related field and 30 (56%) had 5 or more years of professional experience. Over 80% of participants answered all comprehension questions correctly, demonstrating a good level of understanding. Additionally, most participants (see Table 1 for detailed results) found the video to be an enjoyable and helpful way to learn about vigiGroup; agreed that an animated explainer video could be a useful alternative to reading a scientific paper and an effective way to visualise scientific methods; and would like to see more scientific methods presented in this way.",1.0,social,True
89,"Conclusion: The vigiGroup animated explainer video was effective in communicating cluster analysis of adverse event reports to an audience of both pharmacovigilance and non-pharmacovigilance professionals. Increasing the use of such videos, to complement scientific literature, could be an effective way of building knowledge of complex statistical methodology and scientific developments more broadly.

One challenge is the need to contextualize safety when individual subjects have different exposure times (rolling enrollment). Such issues resolve at the end of the study. However, during the study, visualizations add considerable value to the multidisciplinary discussion of incoming safety data. Objective: To develop an interactive dashboard (ABRA-CTV) to display patient safety data in a concise manner, identifying potential adverse event (AE) patterns across exposures (drug/dose) and time periods (exposure length). Methods: The underlying data, used for various analytics and reporting purposes, were drawn from an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Redshift database and conformed to a standard data model via an extract, transform, and load (ETL) process using Enterprise Data Lake Services. For a study, the user selects AEs of interest (filtered by intensity/grade, seriousness, and relatedness) and sets maximum exposure time of interest and risk period beyond last dose. The tool produces a column (x-axis) for each subject with a height (y-axis) corresponding to exposed time. Subjects are grouped by exposure (in open-label or completed studies), and AEs are displayed relative to start of exposure by symbols on each subject-column. The entire population can be displayed, or the display can be limited to the patients with the event(s) of interest. This allows viewing of AEs in the context of total study population (number of columns) and total exposed time (area of the graph as a whole), or to narrow the focus to affected patients. Results: The pilot version of ABRA-CTV has been found most useful: (1) to display multiple events (overlap among subjects, relative timing), (2) to visually compare monotherapy and combination therapy (drug A, drug B, drug A?B), and (3) to compare results from ongoing and completed trials where the display of information from the completed trial is limited to an exposed time similar to the ongoing trial. Although the tool is capable of calculating AE incidence rates, its real value for the assessment of ongoing studies lies in the ability to display events and patient time in an adaptive and intuitive way that allows for meaningful discussion of safety data. Conclusion: Interactive data visualizations can enhance internal risk communication and clinical decision-making during ongoing clinical trials.

105,"Introduction: In 2018, European pregnancy prevention program for oral retinoids, i.e., isotretinoin (acne), acitretin (psoriasis) and alitretinoin (eczema) was updated as part of additional risk minimization measures (RMM) [1, 2] to prevent major congenital anomalies in new-borns whose mothers were exposed to these drugs [3, 4]. Objective: To measure the impact of the 2018 RMMs on utilization patterns of oral retinoids, alternative medications, contraceptives, and on rates of pregnancies occurring concurrently with retinoid prescriptions. Methods: Retrospective cohort study between Jan-2010 and Dec2020 in females of childbearing age (12-55 years) derived from six electronic healthcare record data sources in the Netherlands (PHARMO), Spain (BIFAP and VID-Valencia), Italy (Caserta and ARS-Tuscany), and Denmark (Danish National Registries-DNR). Information from data sources was transformed into the ConcePTION Common Data Model [5]. Common analysis scripts were implemented by study sites. Monthly utilization patterns of isotretinoin, alitretinoin and acitretin (incidence/1000 person-months, prevalence/ 1000 persons, and percentage of discontinuers) were estimated. An interrupted time series analysis was performed to assess immediate changes after the implementation (level change) and over time (trend change). Contraceptive use (percentage) and concurrent pregnancies during retinoid treatment episodes (rates/1000 users) were calculated as well. Results: The study population comprised 11,570,047 females of childbearing age (12-55 years), 88,992 persons used an oral retinoid at any point during the study period. Monthly incidence and prevalence rates showed that retinoid prescriptions have a strong seasonal pattern with peaks of use in winter months. No significant (p \ 0.05) level and trend changes were seen after the implementation of RMMs in August 2018 for incidence, prevalence, and discontinuation rates in any of the study sites. The low level of recording of pregnancy tests did not allow for trend analysis. Contraceptive use could not be measured in ARS and DNR, and was very low in Caserta; in PHARMO, recorded contraceptive use in retinoid users was far below 100%, in VID and BIFAP, recorded contraceptive use increased over time. In BIFAP, there was a significant trend increase after 2018 RMMs in the utilization of contraceptives before the initiation of an oral retinoid treatment, but still far below 100% (15% maximum). Pregnancy rates varied between 0.1 and 0.4 per 1000 retinoid users and occurred in all study sites pre- and post-intervention. Conclusion: Based on the findings, there is very limited measurable impact of the 2018 RMMs among females of childbearing age in the included databases. Moreover, pregnancies still happen during oral retinoid treatment after the implementation. References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,Case,True

117,"Introduction: During the recent covid-19 vaccination campaign, the number of ICSRs reported by patients and professionals has dramatically increased, reaching up to almost 1 M declarations only in Europe (EMA numbers). To deal with such growing amount of data, Synapse Medicine“, in collaboration with The French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM), have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) tool, the Medication Shield, which, based on a natural language processing algorithm, is able to detect ADRs from patients' reports and to code them into an appropriate MedDRA preferred term (PT). Before the covid-19 pandemic, this system was successful in detecting ADRs from the patient reports declared through the French web national reporting system (1, 2). However, how it behaves in conditions of higher reporting flow rate is unknown at present. Objective: To evaluate the performance of the Medication Shield in detecting vaccine-related ADRs from patients' ICSRs declared across the covid-19 vaccination campaign. Methods: A machine learning (ML) pipeline composed by a light Gradient Boosting Machine ensemble model was employed to detect and code covid-19 vaccine-related ADRs from patients' ICSRs declared through the web reporting system during the vaccination campaign (Jan 2021-Apr 2022). The encoding of regional pharmacovigilance centers was employed as the reference ground truth to train the algorithm in a supervised manner. Moreover, a panel of three pharmacologists, with significant experience in ADRs encoding, was set-up to perform a case-by-case analysis of 200 hundreds reports for which the algorithm provided improper encoding. Results: Overall, 65.191 ICSRs were extracted and used to train our ML algorithm. Of this, 54.987 were employed to validate the system. Importantly, almost 86% of the ICSRs were related to covid vaccines. Because the percentage of newly reported ADRs increased over time and was higher for vaccine than not-vaccine related reports, we split the training and validation sets in batches with similar ADRs distribution. Performance evaluation is currently under process. Initial feedbacks from the analysis performed by the experts are showing an uneven distribution of false positive and false negative across samples. Results from the other experts are needed to confirm this finding. Conclusion: The core findings of this study will be gathered in the forthcoming weeks and be ready for the ISoP meeting in September.

124,"Introduction: The analysis of spontaneous reporting systems aims to identify potential adverse drug reactions in a timely and cost-effective manner. For their apparent simplicity, disproportionality analyses assessing the disproportionate presence of single drug-adverse event associations in spontaneous reports are rapidly expanding as a source of safety evidence complementary to clinical trials. However, the world (and spontaneous reports) is more complex than that: events occur in syndromes, drugs are taken in polytherapy, and patients are mosaics of multiple comorbidities. Network science is one of the most promising approaches to tackle such complexity. Objective: To investigate the applications and promises of network science to spontaneous reporting data. Methods: We identified four key examples to highlight the potentiality of network approaches to pharmacosurveillance: multiple drug intake in suicidal attempts, iatrogenic syndromes (i.e., adversome) in Covid-19 and immunotherapy, psychosocial adverse reactions to oxycodone. We used data collected by the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. Entities (e.g., drugs, events, indications) were represented as nodes, and co-reporting relations as links. Depending on the aim, links' weights were estimated in two ways. We used coreporting frequencies to describe cooccurrence patterns for example, polytherapy and iatrogenic syndromes. We used marginal and partial correlations to investigate the associations between entities and their direction: for example, to identify biases and secondary adverse events. We used multilevel algorithms to identify clusters of interest, and network measures to identify trends of co-reporting. Results: The multiple drug intake network showed paracetamol at the center, as a drug of choice both alone and in combinations, and common combinations separated by therapeutic area, plausibly because of availability The Covid-19 adversome identified a cluster of drug-induced hepatic injury and arrhythmia, and a disease-related cluster with Covid-19 infection and respiratory conditions (1). The immunotherapy adversome identified not only the known overlap syndrome (cooccurrence of myocarditis, myasthenia, and myositis), but also another cluster with hepatitis, colitis and thyroiditis. Finally, investigating reactions to oxycodone, we observed that the reporting of crime and psychosocial reactions was secondary to the reporting of drug dependence.

133,"Introduction: The spontaneous reporting system (SRS) has proven to be a cornerstone in the early and cost-effective detection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) [1-3]. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are relatively untapped sources of real-world information that can be used in order to facilitate signal detection in pharmacovigilance (PV). EHRs are a rich source of information on (pharmaco)therapies, diagnoses, laboratory test results, and physicians' notes. However, utilizing the EHR for PV involves a number of critical challenges including the efficient extraction of valuable pieces of information from unstructured bulk of free-text. Objective: To explore whether targeted searches in structured and unstructured fields in EHRs can be used as a method to detect possible cases in addition to spontaneous reports to strenghten a (potential) safety signal. Methods: Searches were performed in the EHRs of the Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC) in NL, to identify potential cases for two established and two suspected ADRs generated by signal detection of the SRS of Lareb. Suspected ADRs refer to potential signals based on the analysis of spontaneous reports with insufficient evidence insight into a possible relationship between the ADR and the drug.

These patients had either died, had been transferred to another hospital, or were still inpatients when the study ended. There were 31.5% of patients using MDS and 68.5 % of patients not using MDS. Of the total MDS using patient journeys, 99.2% needed hospital pharmacist interventions and were ranked by Eadon Scale; 3 (34.7%), 4 (32.2%) and 5 (33.1%). Of the total non-MDS using patient journeys, 50.9% needed hospital pharmacist interventions and were ranked by Eadon Scale ; 3 (41.5%), 4 (52.2%) and 5 (5.9%). The median time in minutes for pharmacist workforce activity based on RSPWC was 160.9 minutes for MDS using patients, and 99.5 minutes for non-MDS using patients. Conclusion: This study has identified that the use of MDS increase the burden to pharmacist workforce input. It is evident from the findings, that interventions may be needed for the majority of MDS using patients.

Methods: We performed a disproportionality analysis using data on spontaneous reports recorded in VigiBase“. Data have been extract on May 8th, 2022. We calculated reporting odds ratio (ROR) as a measure of disproportionality for hypertension defined by the Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) query (SMQ) narrow. ROR was estimated for all reports including the MedDRA preferred term (PT) ``hypertension'', ``blood pressure increased'' and ``hypertensive crisis'' (cases). All other reports have been defined as non-cases. All reports in which the suspected causative agent was a COVID-19 vaccine were used as index reports and all other reports as reference. A signal was defined by at least three reports of the PT of interest and ROR025 [ 1. We reviewed the medical literature using MEDLINE from January 2021 to May 2022 using ``COVID-19 vaccines'' AND ``hypertension'' as a search terms to check for evidence from observational studies. Results: As of May 8th, 2022, VigiBase“ included 3,746,090 reports of adverse events following immunization for COVID-19 vaccines and 87,653 de-duplicated reports of hypertension define by the SMQ. We identified 34,955 reports of ``hypertension'' (ROR:1.3; ROR025:1.2), 47,733 reports of ``blood pressure increased'' (ROR:2.6; ROR025:2.6) and 3,741 reports of ``hypertensive crisis'' (ROR:4.0; ROR025:3.8) in which a COVID-19 vaccine was indicated as suspected causative agent.

A meta-analysis of observational studies that includes 357,387 individuals reported 13,444 events of blood pressure abnormal or increased2. These events have been often described as short periods of hypertensive response and often observed in patients with risk factors. Conclusion: Our results confirmed a signal of risk of events of elevated blood pressure following immunization with COVID-19 vaccines. However, there is no evidence that these episodes could result in serious complication typically associated with hypertension, such as stroke, aneurysms, heart failure, myocardial infarction and chronic kidney disease.

174,"Introduction: Intravitreal drugs such as bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept are widely used to treat a wide range of retinal diseases. Several studies suggest that repeated injections of these drugs may lead to a sustained rising of intraocular pressure increasing risk for glaucoma. To date, a comparative safety study of these three drugs with respect to the incidence of glaucoma diagnosis has not been done. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of glaucoma diagnosis compared among new users of bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept in Tuscany. Methods: A retrospective cohort study using the Tuscan regional administrative database was conducted. Subjects with a first intravitreal injection (index date) between January 2011-June 2020 were identified and followed to the first occurrence of glaucoma diagnosis. Patients with less than a five-year look-back period, those with less than one year of follow-up, and those with previous use of intravitreal dexamethasone, diagnosis of diabetes or glaucoma were excluded. We also excluded patients for whom we could not track the first injection to bevacizumab, ranibizumab or aflibercept. Glaucoma diagnosis was identified from exemptions, diagnosis in hospital discharge records or drug dispensations. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted to analyze risk of glaucoma diagnosis between the three drugs. A Cox model was constructed to compute hazard ratios adjusting for age, sex comorbidities, corticosteroid use and binocularity. To control for retinal vein occlusion, a potential confounder for this question, a stratification by use of anticoagulants in the six months prior/after cohort entry was performed. Results: A total of 6593 new users were included in the analysis (Aflibercept ,"" 1749, Bevacizumab "","" 1115, Ranibizumab "","" 3729). Women made up 60% of the cohort with a mean age of 73 years (± 12.3 years). Overall, the incidence of a glaucoma diagnosis was 2%, 5.3% and 5.9% in the aflibercept, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab group, respectively. The risk of incident glaucoma diagnosis compared to aflibercept was significantly higher among non-anticoagulant users who had received ranibizumab (HR 2.55; CI 95% 1.77-3.66) and bevacizumab (HR 3.07; CI 95% 2.03-4.66). Among anticoagulant users no statistically significant difference was observed. Conclusion: Our study reported an incidence of glaucoma diagnosis of approximately 5% in patients treated with anti-VEGF drugs. Moreover, we found an increase in the risk of glaucoma with ranibizumab and bevacizumab compared to aflibercept among nonanticoagulant users. A time dependent exposure analysis is ongoing to confirm these results. References/Further Sources of Information Not applicable.""",1.0,disease,True

Objective: Objective was to revise the original method so that it is less sensitive to small differences and test it on two covid-19 vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna). Methods: The revised method used only the most predictive measure [3] of the two Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests originally designed: the p-value of the KS test of the TTO distribution of a given event post a given vaccine against the TTO distribution of the same event post other vaccines. A threshold on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, that can have values between 0 and 1-0 for no difference between time-to-onset distributions and 1 for extreme differences-- was set at 0.2. A threshold on the p-value of the KS test was set at 0.05. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System was prospectively frozen every week of the first quarter 2021 and the revised TTO signal detection method was prospectively applied on the two covid-19 vaccines.",1.0,vaccine,True
180,"The performance in detecting events that were posteriori determined as causally related to the exposure of the covid-19 vaccines, namely Pericarditis and Myocarditis, was retrospectively assessed. Results: Pericarditis post Pfizer/BioNTech covid-19 vaccine emerged as a significant TTO signal as early as 15JAN21 (N: 4, distance: 0.80, p-value: 0.012). Myocarditis post Pfizer/BioNTech covid-19 vaccine emerged as a significant TTO signal as early as 29JAN21 (N:5, distance: 0.59, p-value: 0.031). Pericarditis post Moderna covid-19 vaccine emerged as a significant TTO signal as early as 12FEB21 (N: 13, distance: 0.55, p-value: 0.00093). Myocarditis post Moderna covid-19 vaccine emerged as a significant TTO signal as early as 05FEB2021 (N:7, distance: 0.73, p-value: 0.0014). Conclusion: The revised TTO method allowed early detection of unexpected TTO patterns post exposure to covid-19 vaccines by controlling both the level of significance and the magnitude of difference between the TTO distributions in a context of mass vaccination where individual case review is challenging.

189,"Introduction: As of April 3, 2022, 31 COVID-19 vaccines had received approval for use globally (1). With the fast-tracked development and concurrent introduction of vaccines in all countries, there is a need for equitable safety surveillance to monitor adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) in high-income and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Objective: To profile the AEFIs to COVID-19 vaccines, explore the difference in reported AEs between Africa and the rest of the world (RoW), and understand the policy considerations that inform the decision by funding organizations to strengthen safety surveillance systems in LMICs. Methods: We used a convergent mixed methods design involving secondary analysis of 14,671,586 AEFIs to COVID-19 vaccines reported to VigiBasea^ by countries in the WHO Africa Region and the RoW between December 2020 and March 2022. The qualitative component consisted of 12 in-depth interviews with key policymakers from some donor/funding organizations. Results: With 87,351 out of 14,671,586 total reported AEFIs to COVID-19 vaccines (0.6%) Africa had the second-lowest crude AEFI reporting rate of 180 AEs per 1million administered doses. Reports from females made up 73.6% of reports from African and RoW compared to 24.4% for males. The highest number of reports came from persons 18-44 years. 26.0% of the reports were serious, with death being the reason for seriousness in 5% of the reports. Statistically significant differences in AEFI reporting by gender, age group, and serious AEs were found between Africa and the RoW. AstraZeneca, PfizerBioNtech, and Janssen vaccines were the most frequently associated with AEFIs in terms of the absolute number of AEs for Africa and RoW. Sputnik V contributed the highest percentage of AEs per vaccine for Africa. Headache, pyrexia, injection site pain, dizziness, and chills were the top 5 reported AEs for Africa and RoW. Qualitative findings revealed decisions of many funding organizations to fund safety surveillance in LMICs were influenced by considerations about country priorities, the perceived utility of the evidence generated for local decision making, and the contributions to global health by safety surveillance systems. Conclusion: Countries in Africa reported fewer AEFIs to COVID-19 vaccines in VigiBase relative to the RoW, with statistically significant differences in reporting of key parameters that warrant further investigation. Funding decisions by donor organizations were influenced by country priorities and the perceived value added by data generated from safety surveillance systems in LMICs to local and global decision making.

The study analyzed the factors associated with hospital death of patients admitted to UHS with ADE. Objective: To describe patients with ADE identified in the SIH-SUS in Brazil over a ten-year period and to analyze the factors associated with in-hospital death in this study population. Methods: This study is reported following the STROBE guideline. This is a case-control type study, with the original information from the administrative data from the hospital information system of the public health system in Brazil-SIH-SUS, in the period from 2011 to 2020. Results: A total of 116,084,449 Authorization for Hospital Admissions (AHA) in SIH-SUS were evaluated, related to 112,882,404 hospitalizations paid by UHS in the period 2011-2020. After applying the exclusion criteria, 600,944 hospital admissions associated with at least one ADE were included in the study. 659,754 ADEs were reported,with an average of 1.1 ADE/inpatient and an ADE identification rate of 5.7 per 1,000 admissions. The proportion of patients with ADE in hospitalizations was 0.53%, and the risk of death among them was 1.8%. Among people with inpatient ADE, those with higher chances of in-hospital death were: women and older people; people living in more unequal and less developed municipalities--measured by the Gini index and HDI--; patients admitted to hospitals with larger size (number of beds) and medium complexity; patients who presented severity markers of the event that led to admission--shorter hospital stay (up to seven days), use of ICU and admission for urgent/ emergency care. The main drugs involved were antineoplastics and immunomodulators (OR , 2.2; 95% CI ,"" 1.6 to 2.9), causing mainly hepatobiliary (OR "", 7.7; 95% CI , 6.8 to 8.7) or cardiac (OR , 3.7; 95% CI , 3.0 to 4.5) disorders. Drug intoxication (OR , 6.6; 95% CI , 3.5 to 12.4;) and drug abuse were the EADs most associated with increased risk of death (OR , 3.9; 95% CI ,"" 2.0 to 7.6). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that patients with ADE who are female, older, of black/purple and yellow race/color, living in municipalities with lower human development and more unequal, who use antineoplastic and immunomodulatory drugs have a higher risk for in-hospital death. Drug poisoning and drug abuse are the adverse event classes most associated with increased risk of death. This study, confirm that the SIH-SUS is a robust source of data for the field of pharmacovigilance, enabling the identification of risk factors for death and facilitating the monitoring of ADEs in the hospital environment.

209,"Introduction: Transplant recipients are chronically ill patients, who require lifelong drug therapies to prevent reject and graft loss. Maintenance therapy usually involves calcineurin inhibitors, tacrolimus (TAC) or cyclosporine (CsA), combined with mycophenolate (MMF) or mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). To date, there is no consensus on the optimal immunosuppressive strategy [1-4]. Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of maintenance immunosuppressive drug therapies in kidney transplant. Methods: A retrospective multicentre observational study, involving 4 Italian regions, was conducted based on the national transplant Information system and regional healthcare claims data. Specifically, the regional analytical datasets regarding incident patients underwent to kidney transplant in the years 2009-19 were created using an opensource tool for distributed analysis. In the first step, patients in CsA and TAC-based therapy were matched by propensity score 1:1 considering donor/receipt demographical and clinical characteristics. The effectiveness (mortality or reject/graft failure) and safety (incidence of severe infections, cancer and diabetes) of treatments were estimated comparing outcomes between the two groups by a Cox proportional hazard model (HR; CI95%). Analyses were replicated comparing mTOR vs MMF treatment within patients in TAC therapy. Results: Overall, 3,622 kidney recipients were considered, of which 21.7% treated with CsA-based therapy. Among patients in TACbased therapy (N ,"" 2,835), 69.8% and 19.7% were in combination with MMF and mTOR, respectively. During a median follow-up period of 4.0 years mortality and reject/graft failure incidence rates were equal to 1.9 and 2.1 per 100 patient-years (p-y), respectively. Among safety outcomes, serious infections had the highest incidence (9.4 per 100 p-y) followed by diabetes (3.6 per 100 p-y), and cancer (2.4 per 100 p-y). The first comparison showed that patients treated with CsA had higher risk of reject/graft loss (1.69; 1.16-2.46) and incidence of severe infections (1.25; 1.00-1.55) and a lower risk of diabetes (0.66; 0.47-0.91) respect those treated with TAC. While,""",1.0,clinical,True
210,"among TAC users, patients with mTOR had a lower risk of severe infections (0.81; 0.63-1.06) respect those with MMF. Conclusion: In clinical practice, a significantly better benefit profile has been demonstrated for kidney recipients treated with TAC compared to CsA. In particular, the combination of TAC and mTOR appears to be the optimal strategy reducing the incidence of severe infections. Our findings on long term risk-benefit profile of immunosuppressive therapy may be helpful to define the optimal drug therapy in kidney recipients.

Methods: In 5-17 years old vaccinees, and up to April 21, 2022, we explored the COVID-19 vaccine safety using prospectively collected data from the ``Covid Vaccine Monitor'' (CVM) project [1]. CVM comprises several safety assessment approaches amongst which an active surveillance project of COVID-19 vaccines in Europe through web-based baseline ? 6 follow-up questionnaires filled by vaccinees (or their parents). We measured the frequency of local/systemic solicited, and serious adverse reactions following COVID-19 vaccination (first and second doses). The results were compared with findings of pivotal trials in children/adolescents. Results: Overall, 1,033 children/adolescents (5-11 years old: 32.9%; 12-17 years old: 67.1%) who received a first/second dose of vaccine (mostly Comirnaty: 98.2%) were enrolled in the study. Of them, only 658 (63.7 %) filled baseline and at least one follow-up questionnaire and were included in the CVM analysis. Overall, 293 (44.5%) reported at least one AEFI following first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, with injection site pain being the most frequently reported local solicited AEFI (N , 192; 29.2%) in both age groups.

245,"Introduction: Skin lightening agents (SLA) have been commonly self-used by African females to make their skin color lighter for cultural/social perception that equates beauty with fairer skin (1, 2). Skin lightening products contain high concentrations of harmful ingredients such as hydroquinone, mercurials, and corticosteroids, and are reported to cause serious complications such as hyperpigmentation, exogenous ochronosis, wound dehiscence, nephropathy, steroid addiction syndrome, predisposition to infections, and other endocrinologic complications. Despite all these public health risks, they have been used in many countries without regulation and consultation of healthcare professionals (3). Similarly, in Eritrea, there is uncontrolled marketing and use of SLAs even those with banned harmful ingredients. Objective: This study was conducted to assess the perception and utilization of SLAs among females of Asmara, the capital city of Eritrea. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in representative samples of all beauty salons available in Asmara between May and July 2021. The study participants were selected using twostage stratified cluster sampling technique. The data collected through face-to-face interview was entered and analyzed using CSPro 7.3 and SPSS ver. 26, respectively. Results: The study enrolled 721 females. The majority of the respondents agreed that SLAs can make someone white (84.4%), look beautiful (67.8%), trendy and fashionable (55.0%), and had the perception that white skin is more attractive than dark skin (58.8%). About two-third (64.2%) of the participants reported that they have ever used SLAs, mainly influenced by friends (60.6%). Of those who ever used SLAs, 46.4% were current users while 53.6% stopped it due to serious adverse effects, fear of adverse effects, and/or ineffectiveness of products. About half of the respondents (51.7%) used SLAs on a daily basis and the mean duration of use was 4 years (SD , 5.6; range ,"" 0 to 38). With the use of SLAs, 43.7% experienced at least one adverse effect and 66.5% were satisfied with its use. Employed females (AOR: 1.68, CI 1.16, 2.43; p "","" 0.006) were more likely to be current users of SLAs compared to the unemployed and females who had favorable attitude against the use of SLAs were less likely to be current users (AOR: 0.96, CI 0.93-0.98; p "", 0.001). Conclusion: Utilization of SLAs among females was prevalent. They were satisfied with its use despite experiencing adverse effects which urges coordinated efforts in tightening the regulation of cosmetics in general and establishment of cosmetovigilance systems in particular.

253,"Introduction: Drug therapy in paediatrics is often associated with uncertainties due to lack of data from clinical trials. 42-90% of hospitalised children and adolescents are therefore treated with medication outside their product licence, in the outpatient setting 46-64% of patients are affected [1,2]. Due to this off-label use, missing paediatric dosage forms and complex dose calculations, medication errors (ME) occur up to three times more frequently compared to adults [3]. In addition, it can be assumed that 3-5% of admissions to paediatric hospitals are due to an adverse drug reaction (ADR) [4,5]. Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the nature, characteristics and preventability of drug-related hospital admissions in paediatrics. Methods: Within the study, all patients aged 0 to \ 18 years, admitted non-electively to one of the 12 participating children's hospitals in Germany between 07/2018 and 06/2020, were screened for drug-related hospitalisations. A screening tool was used to systematically identify suspected ADRs and MEs. If parents had given consent for data transfer and further analysis, the suspected ADRs resp. MEs were subsequently validated by a blinded, independent expert team [6]. All ADRs and MEs were assessed with regard to their nature, preventability, severity and drug association. Results: Of 41.829 patients admitted to these paediatric hospitals, 54.7% (22.875) had at least one drug administration before hospitalisation. Consent for further analysis was obtained for 9.732 (42.5%) of the patients with medication. Through the use of the screening tool, almost 40% (38.6%, 3.753) of these were suspected to be drug-related. 615 (16.4%) suspected cases were positively validated as drug(s) being the reason for hospital admission; the remaining cases in question were unlikely to be drug-related or suspected in error. 346 ADRs and 269 MEs were identified. Allergic conditions, seizures (incl. subtypes) and respiratory tract infections associated with the administration of immunosuppressants, viral vaccines and antiepileptic drugs were the main reasons for hospitalisation due to ADRs. Treatment noncompliance, accidental exposure to product and dosing problems (mainly underdosing) were primarily identified as MEs in connection with the use of antiepileptic drugs, insulins and analogues and other beta-lactam-antibacterials. 47.3% (291) of drugrelated hospital admissions were preventable. Conclusion: Drug-related hospital admissions play a significant role in paediatrics. Moreover, almost half of them are considered preventable and therefore result in unnecessary harm and treatment costs. Dosing databases, training, and systematic screening for ADRs and MEs have great potential to increase the safety of drug therapy in children.",1.0,clinical,True

The lack of staff trained in PV is one of the most serious limiting factors affecting the development of PV in resource-constrained settings. Previous experiences suggest that blending learning programmes can be implemented in resource-limited countries to train health care professionals (HCP) with remarkable gains in terms of knowledge acquisition. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of our blended learning training programme Methods: We developed the blended-courses integrated with a Train of Trainers scheme [1]. Two e-learning courses were made available on a web-based application, together with a manual on how to combine the e-learning courses together with face-to-face interactions. The blended course were given in Tanzania, Eswatini and Nigeria. We compared the participants pre- and post course test results (Students t-test evaluation), assessed the participants' satisfaction and changes in attitudes towards PV (questionnaires survey) and the total number of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) submitted to each National PV Agency twelve months before and after the training, although we did not match the reporters to the participants that took the courses.",1.0,Case,True

Objective: The three main objectives were to identify the elements necessary for the diagnosis of an adverse drug reaction, report an adverse drug reaction and perform drug causality assessment. Methods: The training was organized in 3 stages. First, students practiced clinical reasoning (CRS) by conducting fictive pharmacovigilance telehealth consultations. Second, students wrote a medical letter summarizing the telehealth consultation and analyzing the drug causality assessment. This letter was sent to the teacher for a graded evaluation. In the third stage was a debriefing course with all the students. Results: Of the 293 third-year medical students enrolled in this course, 274 participated in the distance learning CRS. The evaluation received feedback from 195 students, with an average score of 8.85 out of 10. The qualitative evaluation had only positive feedback. The students appreciated the different format of the teaching, with the possibility to be active. Conclusion: Through distance CRS of pharmacovigilance, medical students' competences to identify and report adverse drug reactions were tested. The students experienced the pharmacovigilance skills necessary to detect adverse drug reactions in a manner directly relevant to patient care. The overall evaluation of the students is in favor of this type of method. References/Further Sources of Information Not applicable.",1.0,clinical,True

282,"Introduction: Herbal medicinal products (HMP's) are commonly believed by consumers to be safe. In contrary to that believe, HMP's can cause adverse drug reactions (ADR's) and/or interactions with conventional medicines (CM). HMP's often do not have the same legal status as CM, but are often on the market as food supplements. To ensure the safety of the HMP's and to protect consumers, optimal pharmacovigilance (PV) practices must be in place. Objective: To create an overview of the current state of herbal pharmacovigilance and to give recommendations about the best practices of PV of HMP's based on a study with interviews held with experts in herbal PV from different countries across the world. Methods: This research used a qualitative inductive methodology through thematic analysis. The first step was to identify, through a literature review, current practices for herbal pharmacovigilance. Based on the findings a semi-structured interview guide was designed, and purposive sampling was used to recruit the interview participants. Through two different networks, the ISoP-Herbal & Traditional Medicines Special Interest Group (SIG) and the Nutrivigilance netwerk, 46 experts in herbal pharmacovigilance were invited via e-mail to participate in an interview.

Follow-up ended due to either MC discontinuation, loss to follow-up, 3 years follow-up, or end of data collection (May 2019, 6 months after the last patient in). Data were collected at inclusion and at follow-up visits every 3 months for the first 2 years, then at least once per year in the third year. MC mode of administration (ingestion, inhalation, other), and cannabinoid content ratio (tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)dominant, cannabidiol (CBD)-dominant, or balanced) were documented. AEs occurring since the last follow-up visit were recorded and coded using MedDRA preferred terms (PTs). Results: 2,991 patients were enrolled in the registry (mean age 50.9 years, 50.2% females) and the most frequent primary indications for MC were pain (77.5%), anxiety (9.7%), and insomnia (4.8%). Over follow-up, 108 (3.6%) patients experienced moderate or severe AEs, yielding 111 AE reports (3 patients had 2 reports), of which 9 were certainly/probably related to MC and met the regulatory criteria of seriousness (5 required intervention, 3 disability [transient according to case narratives], 1 hospitalization prolongation). Reports included a total of 214 AEs (average 1.9 AEs per report). The most common PTs were dizziness (12.9%), nausea (11.3%), somnolence (9.7%), and vomiting (8.1%) for ingested MC, and headache (13.0%) for inhaled MC. Dizziness and somnolence were the most frequent PTs associated with THC-dominant MC (12.0% each); for CBD-dominant products, vomiting (19.0%) was most common; and dizziness (17.5%), nausea (14.0%), somnolence (10.5%), and headache (8.8%) were the most frequent for balanced content. Conclusion: There were no new safety concerns identified in the Registry, although notable differences in AE profile between modes of administration and cannabinoid content ratios should be considered by health professionals. Further work identifying and managing risk factors for AEs is warranted to maintain a favorable risk-benefit ratio for MC. References/Further Sources of Information Not applicable.",1.0,case,True

301,"Introduction: Dengue is one of top ten global health threats and is a serious burden in the Philippines. Dengvaxia immunization program was launched on April 2016 for children 9-14-year-olds in three regions with high statistics of dengue, hospitalization, and deaths. This was coincidentally the campaign period for national elections. Use of vaccine, once available, was part of a strategy to control epidemic. Current measures were inadequate. On the 30 November 2017, Sanofi announced an advisory that vaccine should not be used in those who are dengue na®ive otherwise they will have risk for severe dengue and additional hospitalization. What started as vaccine-vigilance information sparked a public outcry. This led to a series of parliamentary investigations, traditional and social media misinformation and disinformation vilifying the health decision makers and the company, and criminal charges filed against over 20 individuals by the state over alleged unproven vaccine caused deaths. Despite attempts to correct these narratives by a few health professionals, the damage to institution, the program, the product, and individuals have been done. The consequences of such actions of emotional approach without understanding the science have resulted",1.0,vaccine,True
302,"in creating general vaccine rejection, hesitancy, other outbreaks such as measles, lowered confidence even with recent COVID vaccines. Objective: This abstract aim to describe the situation at that time in the Philippines and extract lessons that will inform better risk communications during crisis. Methods: Literature analysis and environmental scans were undertaken. Results: Some of the important lessons learned are in risk management and communications. Adverse health product information should be announced with circumspect considering the level of health literacy and risk appreciation in a country. Partisan politics interfered with poorly understood science, fueled by imprudent comments by officials and health professionals who spoke out of turn, amplified by the media and created chaos. The fear was so palpable that enlightened health professionals refused to provide countervailing facts. While the vaccine is listed as part of WHO EML and used in many countries, Philippines has imposed a ban on the product. Reinstating the vaccine would be perceived as the government had back-pedaled on a mistake. In the meantime, the drama contributed to vaccination hesitancy and outbreaks. Conclusion: Public health decisions are policy and regulatory decisions anchored in ethical and utilitarian principles. Pharmacovigilance plays an important role in public health decisions but only if approached in a scientific and objective manner and in the context of a country's culture.

347,"Introduction: Vaccines are vital tools to control epidemic and pandemic diseases, such as COVID-19, demonstrating safety and effectiveness. However, rare adverse events of special interest (AESIs) following vaccination arise with every new emerging pathogen vaccine program. The mechanisms underlying AESIs such as myopericarditis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are not known. Adversomics, a set of technologies that measure the inventory of molecules (e.g., DNA, RNAs, proteins, inflamatory mediators) in a given sample collected during and after an adverse reaction, has potential to uncover the etiologies of AESIs. The International Network of Special Immunization Services (INSIS) brings together vaccine safety, public health, and systems biology experts in middleand high-income countries to investigate the causes of, and identify strategies to mitigate AESIs following vaccination (insisvaccine.org). Objective: INSIS aims apply an `adversomics' approach to identify molecular signatures and biomarker risk factors associated with AESIs to inform vaccine development and risk-benefit of assessment of vaccines for pandemic and epidemic diseases, with scalability to respond to new safety signals anywhere in the world. Methods: INSIS-led studies will employ a case-control design. Wellcharacterized cases with AESIs post-vaccination, starting with thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) following COVID-19 viral vector vaccines and myopericarditis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, will be matched to controls. Brighton Collaboration case definitions and harmonized protocols will be employed to collect detailed clinical data and serial blood samples suitable for adversomics (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, flow-based immunophenotyping) analysis. A central database and centralized sample processing at INSIS-affiliated multi-OMICs labs will ensure internal validity. Integration of clinical and biological data will enable comparisons of analyte levels and immune responses within groups over time and between cases and controls. Global collaboration across five continents will ensure adequate sample size. Results: The INSIS approach and its reach as a global network will enable characterization of molecular signatures and biomarkers associated with post-vaccination AESIs. Conclusion: INSIS-led studies will provide insight into pathways triggered in these AESIs and susceptible populations to inform vaccine development strategies to reduce the potential to trigger pathways involved in AESIs, risk-benefit assessment, and personalized vaccination strategies. Through global collaboration, INSIS aims to reduce the potential for AESIs in the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

369,"Introduction: Pharmacovigilance has traditionally been a reactive science with a significant dependence on spontaneous adverse event reporting. The pandemic on the other hand has accelerated application of novel technologies and approaches to engaging with the patient, remote connected care at their home and dependence on technologies to supplement regular communication channels. Telemedicine is evolving rapidly and playing a key role in clinical interventions Objective: Digital Health and novel technologies offer a significant opportunity to enhance pharmacovigilance thru proactive patient monitoring, risk communication, personalized care plans and access to real world data. Leveraging such approaches will not only lead to early detection of risks but also to personalized interventions and improved patient outcomes. Methods: Digital devices can monitor vitals for the patient while AI/ ML methods could identify patterns within the data which indicate clinical changes as well as personalize thresholds for individual patients. Educational material which is more interactive, visual and multi-dimensional can replace paper or text based risk communication material. Results: Embedding digital health approaches as well as AI/ML technologies along with enhanced analytics with RWD help monitor the patients changing state and indicate clinically significant events. This could provide early signal detection in individual patients and enable proactive patient level pharmacovigilance. Educational and risk related material can be dynamically updated based on patient preferences, interactions and profiles. Machine learning approaches which link material with outcome can enhance impact of pharmacovigilance methods and tools. Conclusion: Digital Health, AI/ML and RWD have created opportunities to enhance and personalize pharmacovigilance. In order to utilize the full potential of such options it is critical that the regulatory framework is updated to enable such approaches which complement traditional PV and can drive efficiencies and higher effectiveness in the risk communication process. Collaboration within the network of industry and regulators is essential to further such research and maximize the impact on value for patients, HCPs and sponsors.

373,"Introduction: Large amounts of data associated with safety issues are generated along the entire lifetime of drugs, from its infancy as preclinical leads, through its adolescence as clinical candidates, all the way up to its adulthood as marketed drugs exposed to the human population. Across the different stages in the life of a drug, some of the data collected initially may be confirmed and consolidated with data at an advanced stage, whereas other data may not be translated, and in some cases may even contradict, those safety signals that are ultimately observed in the human population. Collecting and properly integrating such an heterogenous pool of data is a complex and tedious task. But even if one manages to put all data together, the construction of useful models to anticipate and detect drug safety signals remains a challenge. Objective: The presentation will cover our efforts to connect data from in vitro safety pharmacology, preclinical toxicology, clinical safety and post-marketing spontaneous reports for over 9,000 small molecule drugs, combination drugs, and biologics. A novel consensus approach using various statistical and machine learning methods to anticipate side effects of potential safety concern, detect adverse drug reaction signals and perform pharmacovigilance analyses will be introduced. Use case application examples to individual drugs and drug classes will be discussed. Methods: Our consensus approach to post-marketing surveillance integrates four different methodologies based on detection of prior safety markers, identification of class reactions, statistical projection of disproportionalities based on reporting frequencies and velocities, and machine learning models of translational safety data. Results: Results on the validation of our approach to anticipating adverse drug reactions of safety concern to the population at the postmarketing stage based on (i) in vitro safety pharmacology data, (ii) preclinical toxicology data, (iii) clinical safety data and (iv) the first sample of 25 postmarketing spontaneous reports will be presented. Based on data available in each case, the performance of the different methods varies for different drugs, drug classes, and side effects. A discussion on performances in selected use cases will be included. As an example, the analysis of long-term PARP inhibition on circadian patterns and its dependence on the reporting bias by consumers will be discussed. Conclusion: Integration and modelling of the large amount of translational safety data currently available from all phases of drug discovery, development and post-marketing to anticipate and follow adverse drug reactions opens an avenue to a whole new perspective in pharmacovigilance.

381,"Objective: We aim to examine the online information-seeking behavior concerning the most popular psychedelics, including cannabis--a quasi-psychedelic--in the European Union (EU) members of interest and the UK before and during the pandemic. Methods: We designed a ``dictionary'' of terms to extract online search data from Google Trends concerning psychedelics and cannabis from 01-Jan-2017 to 1-Jan-2022. We conducted a triple (HoltWinters) exponential smoothing--additive model--for time series analysis to infer seasonality [4, 5]. We utilized hierarchical clustering--an unsupervised machine learning method--to explore clusters of countries concerning the spatial (geographic) mapping of these chemicals. We also implemented--a t-test--for comparing the slope difference of two trends (before versus during the pandemic). Results: There was an evident seasonal pattern for cannabis, NBOMe, and psilocybin in almost all nations of interest. In Italy, cannabis had a quarterly seasonality (p-value \ 0.0177), while NBOMe and psilocybin exhibited a half-yearly and an annual seasonality, respectively (p , 0.0007 and p ,"" 0.0126) (Table 1). Similar patterns existed in France and the UK, while those in Germany, Sweden, and Romania had relatively shorter periodicity.

391,"Introduction: Continuous monitoring of the safety profile of drugs is one of the critical processes of pharmacovigilance. As medical literature might be valuable source of safety data, especially for rare, unlisted, serious cases, all MAHs are obliged to medical literature monitoring (MLM) in all marketing countries [1]. Current state of local MLM is manual reading ``from cover to cover'' without any automation. This approach can be changed through modern automation techniques. Objective: To develop and test a tool for automated monitoring of local literature and enhance drug safety data identification. Methods: Modern programming approaches were used to create PV platform, intended for automated literature screening. GAMP 5 recommendations were used to prove the validation status. Results: We developed a tool--DrugCard PV platform which screens local medical sources for updates on a weekly basis. Till May 2022 we added around 150 local journals originated from 10 countries that cover different therapeutic areas. Our tool automatically searches for defined keywords (drug trade names, active substances) in published articles. Different file formats can be screened including text, pdfs, images etc. In case a new issue of a journal is published--a PV specialist will receive an email notification. The mandatory features of a validated computerized system, like audit trail, logs, reports are also present here. Instead of manual reading of the whole journal issue the user only should read a separate article, analyze whether there is a valuable safety data and label it depending on the content. PV specialists may work together inside the platform and provide a quality check for labeled articles. Our pilot study of how a new tool may improve the efficiency revealed interesting results. We found out that around 12 times less time is needed for literature screening with automated approach vs traditional approach (average 24 hours/week vs 2 hours/week). This was calculated with the list of journals in Ukraine (n , 100) and portfolio of popular drugs (k ,"" 50). Despite the dramatically decreased amount of time needed, the number of identified ICRSs from literature increased. During the abovementioned pilot study of automated local literature monitoring lasting 2 months, 31 safety cases were identified (valid and non-valid ICSRs). This is much more than usual rate of safety cases finding. Conclusion: Automated local medical literature monitoring is current technological approach which should be widespread among PV departments of MAHs and CROs. It offers increasing efficiency in safety information identification with less time spent on routine activities. References/Further Sources of Information""",1.0,case,True

400,"Introduction: A plethora of pharmacovigilance studies have recently described the spectrum, kinetics and other features of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) [1], including rare but potentially fatal irAEs such as overlap syndrome (myocarditis with myositis/myasthenia gravis) [2]. Hyperacute toxicity is a recent newly described entity, albeit incompletely characterized [3]. Objective: To describe pharmacological and clinical features of hyperacute toxicities reported to the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) through a network-based approach (the Immune-Adversome). Methods: We collected adverse events to ICIs (including antiCTLA4/PD-1/PD-L1 agents) recorded in FAERS up to December 2021. We selected reports with available information to calculate a plausible time-to-onset. Events of interest were classified into fulminant (within 7 days) and hyper-acute cases (within 21 days, i.e., during the first infusion cycle). Cases were described in terms of demographic and clinical features: age, gender, anticancer regimen (combination vs monotherapy), therapeutic indications, seriousness (hospitalization), case fatality rate (CFR, namely the proportion of cases where death was reported as outcome), co-reported symptoms, co-reported irAEs. The Immune-Adversome was estimated considering events as nodes and co-reporting as links. Analyses were performed using the ``R'' software (v. 4.1.2). Results: Out of 11,798,098 FAERS reports, ICIs were recorded in 64,112 cases (59,022 had plausible time to onset). Hyperacute cases (18,691) represented 31.7% of total ICI reports, and were mainly reported in males (62.7%), from Asia (34.8%), by clinicians (46%). No significant differences emerged with regard to seriousness between hyperacute and other cases (onset [21 days), namely hospitalization (42.9% vs 49.8%), death (27.9% vs 23.21%) and CFR (15.6% vs 13%; 16% for fulminant cases). Monotherapy was reported in the majority of cases (88.6%), mainly pembrolizumab (5,687). Pyrexia, diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea were the most frequently reported symptoms. Hyperacute myocarditis was reported in 34.7% of cases with specified time-to-onset (862 over 1,583 total cases), with a CFR of 46.5%. Among fulminant cases, most frequent irAEs were interstitial lung disease (624), colitis (450), hypothyroidism (369), and myocarditis (234). The Immune-Adversome identified different hyperacute multisystem irAEs, including overlap syndrome (median onset 10 days, CFR 37%).

408,"Introduction: The prolongation of the QT interval is a serious and potentially fatal adverse reaction that has led to the discontinuation of many drugs (including some opioids). Data mining on pharmacovigilance databases can detect signals that identify early the risk associated with some drugs. Objective: To examine the association between opioids and risk of QT prolongation in reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) between 2004 and 2021. Methods: Relevant reports in the FAERS were identified and analyzed. The reporting odds ratio (ROR ± IC95), Proportional ADR reporting ratio (PRR ± IC95), Chi square (Yates' correction), and Yule's Q (Q ± IC95) was used to detect spontaneous report signals, calculated using the case/non-case method. Cases were identified using Standard Medical Querry (SMQ) for QT Prolongation defined by MedDRA 21.0 in which opiods (Meperidine, Tramadol, Dextropropoxyphene, Methadone, Fentanyl, Morphine, Hydromorphone, Oxycodone, Buprenorphine, and/or Nalbuphine) were the suspected drug. Results: A total of 36239 drug-reaction pairs was found in 580261 opioid reports. Significant Signal (ROR, PRR, Chi2, Q) were found for whole opioid group: ROR 1.28 (1.26-1.29), PPR 1.27 (1.25-1.29), Yule's Q 0.14 (0.12-0.16) and Chi2 With Yate's Correction: \ 0.00001.

Conclusion: Analysis of the FAERS database showed significant signals for QT prolongation with opioid treatments. Underlying mechanism is unknown, but it seems to be linked to hERG channel blocking. We propose the evaluation of the trend of change in the confidence intervals of the disproportionality parameters as a measure that can predict the occurrence of clinical events at the population level and a posible usefull strategy to minimize adverse reactions.

416,"Introduction: Language and speech are increasingly debated as potential markers for diagnosing and monitoring patients with affective and psychotic disorders (1-3). However, many neglected factors may confound communicative atypicalities. A comprehensive list of potential confounding drugs will support the design of robust communicative marker studies. Objective: We aim at identifying a list of drugs potentially associated with speech and language disorders, within psychotic and affective disorders. Methods: We identified terms from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) inherent to speech and language Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) and segregated them into clusters of overlapping terms to structure a search on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS, updated to June 2021). Within the FAERS, we considered separately 3 populations (psychotic, affective and non-neuropsychiatric disorders), to account for the confounding role of different underlying conditions. We calculated the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) for individual drugs with a Bonferroni correction. Associations which were not already reported in the SIDER database of labelled ADRs, were further stratified based on expected biases (using Directed Acyclic Graph). Robustness analyses were performed to account for the biases. Results: We identified a list of 291 potential expected and 91 unexpected confounding medications for the identification of communication markers of affective and psychotic disorders (e.g.,",1.0,cluster,True

Conclusion: We provided a list of medications to be accounted for in future studies of communicative bio-behavioral markers in affective and psychotic disorders. The methodological procedure we developed does not simply facilitate future investigations of communicative biomarkers in other conditions, more crucially it provides a casestudy in more rigorous procedures for digital phenotyping in general.

424,"Introduction: The comparison of safety profiles for products recently on the market is difficult. There is a lack of methodology for quantifying the potential differences between products that have the same indication. Objective: Provide the tools to quantify the differences in spontaneous reporting between two products Methods: Under the null assumption that two products have the same safety profile, the scatterplot of the Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) measured for the different MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs) post Product A (axis x) and post Product B (axis y) should follow the diagonal line. An Euclidian distance from the EBGM to the diagonal line measures the deviation from what would have been expected under the null assumption of similar safety profiles. As the deviation does not capture the statistical uncertainty around the estimate, we propose as measure of the deviation the minimal distance of the four Euclidian distances calculated from each of the credibility intervals around the EBGM post Product A and Product B.

431,"Introduction: The application of text mining approaches to identify adverse events (AEs) from electronic health records (EHRs) is a growing area of interest in pharmacovigilance research. In veterinary medicine, the majority of EHRs consist of unstructured clinical narratives, hence the development of appropriate methods for identifying AEs of interest is an important step in the research process. Identifying renal disease poses a specific challenge as the event may be described in narrative form or implied by reported test results or the use of renal disease specific medications. In this study we developed regular expressions (regexes) to identify relevant mentions of renal disease in veterinary free text clinical narratives. Objective: To develop a method for identifying veterinary patients with renal disease in free text clinical narratives. Methods: Using VeDDRA terminology as a starting point, we used an iterative approach to develop a series of regexes which were then applied to a random sample of 10,000 clinical narratives. In order to measure precision, clinical narratives containing a match to the regexes were reviewed against a case definition by two independent reviewers and disagreement was settled by consensus. Terms in the final regex were derived from three sources--VeDDRA, a word embedding model and expert opinion. To determine recall, the final regex was applied to a sample of consults where the main presenting complaint was deemed to be renal disease by a veterinary clinician. Results: The regex containing only VeDDRA terms had a poor positive predictive value (PPV) (0.17). Expanding this terminology using a word embedding model improved the PPV to 0.27. Following changes suggested by a veterinary expert, the PPV of the final regex was improved to 0.43. When the regex was divided into three components, the PPV for these individual portions was mentions of renal disease (0.35), mentions of test results (0.44) and mentions of renal disease treatment (0.8). When compared against the veterinary clinician validated sample of renal disease consults recall was 0.07 for the VeDDRA regex, 0.52 for the word embedding model expanded regex and 0.68 for the final regex. Conclusion: The developed regex can be used to identify animals with renal disease, with mentions of renal disease treatment being the most specific indicator of clinical disease. This method can be employed to filter potential cases of interest from large datasets for use in observational studies.",1.0,area,True

Will having the regulators use the same AI make us more comfortable or will legislation be necessary to drive us forward? Objective: Explore why PV has lagged behind with AI technology that is commonplace in other parts of our lives and business. Aspects of AI, such as machine learning, are used in areas such as early disease prediction, clinical diagnosis, outcome prediction and prognosis evaluation, personalized treatments, drug discovery, manufacturing, clinical trial research, and more. In our personal lives, services like Amazon and Google use AI to understand and target their customers and we accept that as normal. The objective of this presentation is to explore the reluctance of accepting AI in PV and how we can move towards overcoming those obstacles. Methods: This presentation is based on the presenters' experience of working in PV for 20? years from an industry, consulting, technology vendor and regulatory authority perspective. We will look at some real-life practical examples where AI in PV has worked and what it took to get there. Results: N/A.

440,"Introduction: Access to case narratives during signal assessment is crucial to provide a more complete picture of the cases [1], however patient confidentiality needs to be considered. Sharing of narratives while preserving privacy requires de-identification--the removal or replacement of personal identifiers. Automating this task can help with increasing data load. To ensure patient confidentiality throughout the full pharmacovigilance process, the narratives should be deidentified early in the process. Person names--one of the more common identifiers in case narratives--can lead to (in-)direct identification of patients but are challenging to recognise in free text. Objective: To develop and evaluate a method for automated deidentification of names in case narratives. Methods: We use an ensemble of BERT [2]--a state-of-the-art language model using deep-neural network--combined with handengineered rules for detecting names. Our model is trained on i2b2 2014 deidentification challenge data [3] combined with unprocessed data from the Yellow Card system[4] provided by the MHRA. Because names are rare in the Yellow Card data, the training dataset is prepared using active learning through an independent model. Model testing is done on a separate, manually annotated dataset. Evaluation of the deidentification is guided by: (1) how often clinically relevant information is removed and (2) how identifiable the narratives that the model fails to completely de-identify are.

Results: Out of the 71 narratives with names and initials, only 12 contained occurrences missed by the system. Manual evaluation found only one directly and one indirectly identifiable narrative due to leaks. It should be noted that the leaked direct identifier was a foreign, non-English name. Automated de-identification only affected 7% of all narratives and only 1% were assessed as missing clinically relevant information after de-identification. A single narrative may contain multiple occurrences of names, the table presents results per occurrence.",1.0,clinical,True
445,Conclusion: Automated de-identification of names is possible without compromising clinically relevant information. Our method can recognise and mask a vast majority of names and most initials while leaving most of the information untouched.

Methods: This case was reported in February 2022 to The National Centre of Pharmacovigilance and evaluated according to the updated French method of causality assessment. Results: A 70-year-old male patient with a past medical history of chronic viral hepatitis B treated with entecavir since 2006, presented to the surgery department with an acute onset of a severe epigastric pain radiating through to the back associated with hepatic colic with nausea and vomiting. Symptoms started 7 days after initiation of metronidazole given by the patient's dentist for treatment of a periodontal abscess. Metronidazole was prescribed twice under two different trade names Birodogyl“ (spiramycine, metronidazole) and Tamizol“(metronidazole) medications. On exam, he had severe epigastric tenderness. Biochemical analysis showed lipase 632 U/L (6N), and amylase 322 U/L (3N). The abdominal CT scan showed an aspect of acute oedemato-interstitial pancreatitis stage B (CSTI 1). Relative negatives in the history included, no lithiasis, no known drug allergies, and no alcohol consumption. Patient symptoms and lipase improved within 3 days after metronidazole withdrawl and initiation of supportive care. Conclusion: The likelihood of metronidazole as the incriminating agent was likely in front of a suggestive delay and favorable outcome after the drug withdrawl. It was suggested a the possible dose-response mechanism between metronidazole use and occurrence of pancreatitis, and this case draw attention to the possible acute pancreatitis associated with metronidazole due to a prescription error.

Patients with a clinical symptom value (CS) C 4/7 were considered relevant. Results: In 34 patients, the total number of drugs prescribed was 290 with an average of 8.5 drugs per patient. The main classes of ATC prescribed are N06 (psychoanaleptics) 8%, B03 (antiemetics) 12%, N05 (psycholeptics) 16%. Five patients with a critical ACB score C 5 were identified. In these patients, the major drugs responsible for elevated ACB were quetiapine, chlorpromazine, and paroxetine, all three with a value of 3. The 5 patients also showed clinical signs of ACB. Three patients had CS C 4/7 and two of them experienced clinical improvement following therapy modification. Conclusion: Computerized determination of CBA was helpful in preventing adverse reactions, identifying which drugs are responsible for adverse reactions and modifying therapy to avoid the occurrence of adverse events. Drug therapy analysis is useful in conjunction with clinical evaluation and can be a valuable tool used in conjunction with tools such as Mini Mental Status.

Unfortunately, many of the existing electronic health records (EHRs) were designed for purposes of medical billing rather than for medical care, resulting in challenges for using the recorded data for safety data capturing. Moreover, commercially available electronic prescribing and computerized physician order entry systems are cost-prohibitive for many health organization, especially non-profit ones. In a previous research project, Egypt Chapter of International Society of Pharmacovigilance (ISoP) was engaged in developing such system in the hospital of Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in Cairo to support identifying MEs that were experienced by refugees through remodeling and adding new features to the existing hospital management system. The developed system was used as the ``intervention'' in this research. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of introducing internally low-cost electronic prescription system in reducing the frequency of MEs of different types. Methods: A pre- and post-intervention study was conducted to compare the frequency of MEs before and after replacing the traditionally used paper-based system with an internal electronic-based system in hospital setting. MEs were collected by reviewing randomized medical records at base line and after one year of introducing this electronic-based system. More focus was given to medical records of elderly patients and emergency ward. The prescribing errors, transcribing errors, dispensing errors, administration errors were investigated. Results: We analyzed 314 paper-based prescriptions at baseline and 416 paper-based and electronic prescriptions at one year of follow-up. The total prescribing errors (before-after %) in elderly were (66-16%) while in the emergency wards they were (71-33%). The errors were (86.9-13.8%) due to a wrong or incomplete transfer of the information from the prescription. Regarding dispensing errors, it was shown that the content errors were (78-33%) and the labeling errors were (68-28%). There were (65-12%) dosing errors during administration. Conclusion: The adoption of internal electronic prescription systems was effective in markedly reducing the frequency of MEs compared to the paper-based system in a low-resource setting where the expense on complex commercial electronic solutions are burden for institutions.

524,"analgesic standard doses of paracetamol has demonstrated its grade of toxicity, at the maximum prescribed dose [3]. Objective: A knowledge assessment on paracetamol management among health professionals can rise new inputs for the risk/benefit ratio of this old molecule [4,5]. Methods: A survey of 7 questions on standard dosage, dose adjustment and antidotes to paracetamol overdose was submitted to 36 health professionals (nurses, pharmacists, oncologists, hematologists, surgeons) in the Cancer Institute of Bari. The answers were collected and charted in diagrams, in order to soon identify critical evidences. Results: The correct answers to the 7 questions were distributed as follows: up to 30-33% to 4, 70% to 2 and 89% to 1 questions, respectively. The lowest value of correct answers (11%) was reported for the question on the minimum time interval among successive administrations, while the highest (89%) was related to the volume of drug solution per administration. About 30-33% of correct responses were given to both questions on the maximum doses in patients with or without additional risks (kidney and/or liver comorbility), respectively, highlighting the lack of knowledge on the need to personalize therapy. The 70% value of correct answers regards the maximum consented daily doses and the antidote N-acetilcysteine. Conclusion: The collecting data have demonstrated the clinical need to manage accurately old and apparently well-known drugs to grant a controlled clinical risk in hospitals. The implementation of Recommendation n∞ 7 by Italian Ministry of Health and precise indications on medical reports of doses and timing in therapy are possible solutions to avoid bad interpretation on prescription and accidental paracetamol overdoses. Pharmacovigilance is a duty for health professionals and the awareness that also old drugs can be causes of toxicity is a substantial starting point for safety of care.

536,"Introduction: High interest in the last two years was globally put by Health Authorities on the recording, coding, and reporting of medication errors to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the use of medicines and to provide reliable information to healthcare professionals and patients. Medical coding is a prerequisite for efficient, effective, and reproducible data outputs. Objective: Not applicable. Methods: A sample of medication error coding results was assessed for accuracy and consistency of MedDRA coding and identification of main types of coding errors. It included 1500 coded reported terms for COVID-19 vaccines medication errors, assigned to MedDRA codes by national regulatory authorities or pharmacovigilance centers and drawn from the Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) VigiBase through August 25, 2021. Results: One-third of the records could not be assessed due to incomplete or unclear verbatims. In one-third, code assignments were correct, but another third of the sample was not adequately coded. Most frequent coding errors corresponded to vague PT assignments, while more detailed information was available for a more precise coding. This observation is similar to the EudraVigilance database, where some of the most assigned MedDRA terms for medication errors also represent vague concepts. Conclusion: These findings indicate that understanding of medication error documentation and assessment and of MedDRA content and coding guidelines need to be reinforced. The MedDRA Maintenance and Support Services Organization (MSSO) offers several MedDRA coding trainings, including coding of medication errors. The authors provide valuable references to the latter, to the applicable ICHEndorsed Guides for MedDRA Users, and to relevant EMA guidance.

In Italy 56% of intoxications affect the age group between 0 and 19 years, 39% of which are consequent to drug exposure [3]. Data collection and systematic analysis of intoxication cases is of fundamental importance to gain a greater knowledge of toxic domestic, environmental and pharmacological agents [4-5]. Objective: To analyze pediatric intoxication cases managed by Liguria's major pediatric Hospital in the absence of a regional Poison Center. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study of the intoxication cases managed by the Emergency Department of the IRCCS G. Gaslini for the period from January 2017 to December 2019.

Records from patients aged [ 19 years old and from those whose ICD9 did not match a poisoning diagnosis were excluded. Included records were then categorized into four main types of intoxication: from drugs, alcohol, carbon monoxide (CO) and fumes, food/other substance. Descriptive statistics were undertaken. Results: Over a 3 year-period 172 intoxication cases, of which 28 with no available data, were treated by the Emergency Department of the IRCCS G. Gaslini. Our analysis included therefore 144 poisoned patient cases, 70 were from females and 74 from males, with a median age of 3 years old. Out of the total of accesses, 38.9% of cases were attributed to drug intoxication in which the agents most involved were analgesics and sedative-hypnotic drugs, 29.9% to carbon monoxide (CO) and fumes poisoning, 24.3% to food/other substance intoxication and 6.9% to alcohol intoxication. Poisoning severity and the need for hospitalization have also been investigated. Conclusion: Implementation of high-performance data collection systems in the Emergency Department could be decisive in guiding clinical choices. This study has gathered data on pediatric poisonings in a regional reality in the absence of a Poison Center. Although preliminary, these findings may guide for the improvement of the surveillance system of intoxications in pediatrics. References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,case,True

Objective: To develop an algorithm to identify possible ADRs in free text of Dutch hospital EHR with a TM tool. Methods: In phase I, the previous rule-based algorithm was translated to a R-algorithm and improved it with the help of previous mentioned issues. In phase II, the terms of MedDRA and SNOMED-CT were added to identify ADRs and in phase III R-scripts were used to improve the R-algorithm. Results: In phase I, the R-algorithm identified 97% (n ,"" 174) of the EHR notes containing possible ADRs identified by the rule-based algorithm. Five ADRs were missed compared to the rule-based algorithm, because of typo's and a EHR conversion. The last PDCA cycle compared to the golden standard achieved a sensitivity of 93%, a PPV of 11% and an F-measure of 0.2. For the potentially serious ADRs a sensitivity of 95% was achieved. There were 64 more EHR notes containing possible ADRs identified, by the R-algorithm. In phase II, there were 105 ADRs identified with the R-algorithm using MedDRA, SNOMED-CT and synonyms. In phase III, the R-algorithm improved the PPV, sensitivity and F-measure. Conclusion: The developed R-algorithm identified ADRs, however further research is required to extrapolate the algorithm and to combine it with clinical decision support systems to bring the data back to the physician to increase ADR registration.

560,"Objective: To analyse hospital admissions due to DRPs and association with MDS. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on four hundred and eighty-seven adult patients' hospital admission episodes. The retrospective analysis took place at the Royal Victoria Hospital, a large general teaching hospital in the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust (BHSCT), over a four month period from July 1st to October 31st, 2021. Each episode was analysed for DRPs and MDS causation using the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe (PCNE)-DRP classification validation V 9.1 system (3) and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code classification system (4). Results: Of the four hundred and eighty-seven admissions included, 155 patients (32%) were using MDS, 43 admissions (9%) related to DRPs, out of these 43 admissions with DRPs; 26 patients (60.5%) were using MDS with DRPs, and three patients (7%) had an MDS related DRP. Medications most frequently implicated were antidepressants, ACE inhibitors, analgesics, and antipsychotics. Conclusion: From this study, MDS have been identified as a cause of hospital admissions due to DRPs. The study highlights that inline with published evidence (5), the cohort of patients more at risk of DRPs are the older population. Older patients frequently use MDS and are already at risk of DRPs as they frequently have multi-morbidities and polypharmacy (6). This study has highlighted that ongoing measures should be considered to reduce DRPs such as deprescribing and regular medication reviews. It also highlights the importance of engaging with patients and carers to increase medication education and awareness. References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,Social,True

Objective: To describe the pharmaceutical interventions (PIs) carried out by a clinical pharmacist and to evaluate their clinical impact. Methods: A prospective observational study was performed in a 16-bed, university-affiliated, COVID-19 ICU in Morocco. Drugs were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification code system. PIs were registered by the pharmacist using the French Society of Clinical Pharmacy's PI sheet, and their clinical impact was assessed using Hatoum scale (0-to-3). Data of a two-month period, from October 2020 to December 2020, were analyzed using Excel. Results: 201 PIs were generated by the clinical pharmacist and concerned 58 COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure. A median age of 64.5 years [IQR 58.25-69.75] was found and 83% of patients were male. The main drug-related problems were dosage error (37%), non-conformity to guidelines (24%), drug omission (18%), and drug interactions (7%). 58% of the interventions were performed after the medical prescription and consisted mainly of dosage adjustment (47%), followed by drug discontinuation (16%) and treatment reminder (13%). Drugs that belong to J, B, and P ATC groups accounted for 32%, 16% and 15% of PIs, respectively. Study results show an acceptance rate of 89%. 88% of the PIs had a clinical impact of 1 and 12% had a clinical impact of 2. Conclusion: The active role of clinical pharmacists in the ICU is well established in the literature. Our study underlines the necessity of clinical pharmacy services in the COVID-19 ICU, which helps in preventing drug errors and providing optimal care to this sensitive population.

581,"Objective: To establish the number of medication errors reported due to look-alike Antiretroviral Therapy amongst adult clients over a 12month period at Mbagathi Hospital Comprehensive Care Center Pharmacy. Methods: A survey was carried out over a 12month period between January 2021 and January 2022 to establish the number of medication errors reported due to look-alike Antiretroviral Therapy amongst Adult clients. The results of the study were captured in the medication error reporting forms at the Comprehensive Care Center Pharmacy and in a table indicating the error. Results: Over the 12month period, 2 medication errors were reported due to look-alike Antiretroviral Therapy. The medication errors reported occurred after two adult clients were dispensed with the wrong medication due to look-alike medications that were stored next to each other on the dispensing shelf. The medications were Abacavir/ Lamivudine (120/60 mg) instead of Tenofovir/Emtricitabine (300/ 200 mg) and Abacavir/Lamivudine (600/300 mg) instead of Zidovudine/Lamivudine (300/150 mg) respectively. Conclusion: Medication errors were found to have occurred over the 12month survey period. The study was able to confirm that medication errors can occur when staff lack proper training on how to store and dispense look-alike medications. It is therefore important to continuously train staff on appropriate storage and dispensing practices to avoid these medication errors and to have standard operating procedures on how to store and dispense look-alike medications. After the medication error incident we proceeded to rearranged all the look-alike medications ensuring that they were not stored in close proximity to each other and we also printed bold labels for all the medications on the shelves.

596,"Methods: We performed a literature search on PubMed and EMBASE, from inception till May 2022, to identify cases of NMDs where paracetamol was associated with liver injury. Exclusion criteria were overdose, risk factors, and liver disease. Case reports were critically appraised [4]. Association was assessed using Bradford Hill criteria [5]. Case definition, severity grading and causality assessment were done using the RUCAM scale and criteria set by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences [6]. Results: Eight case reports qualified: 6 males, 2 females; 6 had muscular dystrophies, 2 spinal muscular atrophies; median (Q1-Q3) age 18.5 years (13-29); weight 47.5 kg (43-55). Paracetamol consumption was 3 g/day (2.1-3.5), or 50 mg/kg/day (42.9-72.5) for 4 days (4-5.8). Time to onset of clinical manifestations and abnormal liver function tests (LFT) was 4.5 days (4-5.8). LFT values, compared to upper limits or baseline, were: AST 161.7 times (66.6-243.5), ALT 49 times (30.3-167), total bilirubin 5 times (1.9-8) and INR 4.5 times (3.6-6). Paracetamol serum level was 273.3 lmol/L (140.6-505.2). After stopping paracetamol 6 patients recovered (5 with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), 1 without). Two patients died, both had been treated with NAC. Liver injury in all cases was severe and direct (intrinsic). Association was causal and probable. Though we cannot exclude a possible role of concomitant drugs, the causality between paracetamol and liver injury appears probable. Conclusion: Patients with NMDs are at increased risk of toxic serum levels and severe liver injury following therapeutic doses of paracetamol. Vigilance and personalised medicine based on pharmacogenomics can prevent this medication error. Therapeutic recommendations need to be revised.

606,"Introduction: Intoxications by ingestion is the second most common domestic accident in children after traumas. They constitute a serious problem in pediatrics, because of their frequency and difficulties of management. Objective: The aim of our study is to determine the incidence of voluntary intoxications in children, as well as the different toxic agents involved and the morbidity and mortality related to these intoxications. Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study of voluntary intoxications (suicide attempts) admitted to the emergency department and managed at the Rabat Children's Hospital over a period of 5 months, from November 1, 2020 to April 1, 2021. An operating sheet have been established and filled using the epidemiological data and the elements of management of these types of intoxications based on the diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic levels, contained in the patient's files. Results: During the study period, 79 children were admitted to the emergency department for ingestion of toxic products, 18.9% of recorded intoxications were voluntary (suicide attempts), while 81.1% were accidental.

621,"Introduction: Medication Errors (MEs) have been assessed by the criterion of whether they caused adverse drug reactions (ADR) which could have been prevented [1-5]. Typically, several questions are asked like ``interaction involved?'' and in case of any ``yes'', the ADR is considered preventable, and an ME identified. There are problems with this approach. ADRs are assessed when many parameters of the preceding medication are known. In retrospect, it is always possible to conclude that the ADR could have been prevented had certain actions been different. Also, questions about ``preventability'' are used with a binary meaning, i.e., a ``yes-'' or ``no-'' answer is expected instead of a sensibly graded assessment. Objective: To explore how the ME-criterion preventability could be replaced by a more appropriate criterion and which additional aspects of MEs should be assessed. Methods: Literature review and proposal of a new approach with relevant examples of ADR cases. Results: ``Faulty'' regarding the medication was considered as alternative to ``preventable'' with respect to an ADR, since it moves the assessor to the time of medication before the ADR occurred. Also, ``faultiness'' can be graded. Some more suggestions were made: First, to distinguish errors in deciding about a medication from errors in implementing the decision. Second, to distinguish between extent and seriousness of an ME: Aspects of ME-seriousness are how severe an ADR following the ME was, how much more severe or likely--compared to the typical severity or expected frequency--the ADR became, how far the medication deviated from established standards and which options were available to anticipate and minimise the risk. Third, to classify MEs according to whether their faultiness is continuous or binary. Fourth, if an ME preceded an ADR, to ask if--and to what extent--the ME caused or contributed to the ADR. A scheme to classify MEs and cases are presented. Conclusion: In assessing possible MEs as causes of ADRs it is recommended a) to replace the binary hindsight-criterion ``preventable'' for ADRs by the term ``faulty'' for medications, b) to distinguish errors in deciding about a medication from errors in implementing the decision, c) to distinguish between the extent of a deviation from standard and the seriousness of the error, d) to distinguish between MEs by type of faultiness which is either binary or continuous, e) to grade the latter on a scale, and f) to assess the extent to which an ME actually caused the ADR.

630,"Introduction: Since March 13, 2021, Tunisia has started its vaccination campaign. In addition, the Ministry of Health has organized national mass vaccination days to accelerate the vaccination process. The National Centre of Pharmacovigilance, in collaboration with the Primary Health Care Direction, is charged with monitoring and managing adverse events following immunization (AEFI) that included vaccination errors. Objective: Our work aims to describe the type and the frequency of these errors in order to prevent their occurrence. Methods: We conducted an observational study from the onset of the vaccination campaign on March 13, 2021, to September 29, 2021. We collected vaccine errors through the different notification sources used by the National Centre of Pharmacovigilance in Tunisia. We have listed vaccine errors through Vigibase national reports. We categorized the error reports on the basis of the vaccine error type described by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Results: During this period, a total of 8.031297 doses were administered. We counted 153 COVID-19 vaccine errors out of 2609 AEFI (5.86%). Reports were related to wrong doses in 70% (Table 1). Conclusion: Most vaccination misuses are related to technical errors. The enhanced pharmacovigilance reporting system is important for detecting and managing these errors to prevent recurrence during further vaccination campaigns [1]. Moreover, health care providers involved in the COVID-19 vaccine supply chain should anticipate and report COVID-19 vaccine-related errors to promote shared learning opportunities and make every dose of vaccine count.

647,"Introduction: The use of opioids has increased in the general population by 150% from 2006 to 2017 in France. At the same time, an increasing number of intoxications and deaths related to opioid use have been documented [1]. In addition, cases of fatal paediatric accidental intoxication have recently been reported to the National Agency for the safety of Health Products (ANSM) [2]. Objective: In this study, we will analyse pharmacovigilance cases of opioid overdose in children. Methods: A search for French cases of overdose in children aged 0-15 years with opioid drugs, of all galenic forms, was carried out on the European pharmacovigilance database ``Eudravigilance'', from 2001 to April 2022. The substances selected were: morphine, tramadol, fentanyl, methadone, codeine, oxycodone, loperamide, buprenorphine and hydromorphone. The preferred terms associated with the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified with the MedDRA 25.0 dictionary were: ``accidental overdose'', ``extra dose administered'', ``incorrect dosage administered'' and ``incorrect dose administered''. Results: Over the 17-year period, 63 cases of paediatric overdose were collected. The average age of the children was 4 years (median: 3 years, range: 1; 15 years). 91% (n , 57) of the cases were medically confirmed and 65% are related to oral administration (60% capsules/ tablets and 5% syrup). 97% (n , 61) of the cases were serious including 6% (n ,"" 4) death, 38% (n "","" 24) life-threatening, 30% (n "", 19) hospitalisation and 20% (n , 12) unspecified criteria.",1.0,case,True

Conclusion: This analysis confirms the seriousness of opioid overdose in the paediatric population. ANSM raised awareness to the general public and the healthcare professionals about the rules of proper use, the need of the availability of the emergency therapy for opioid overdose, naloxone [3, 4] and moreover the absolute need to keep the treatment out of the reach and sight of children following the two recent cases of death while taking methadone [2].

691,"Introduction: Fluoropyrimidines (FP), including 5-FU and capecitabine, are antimetabolites commonly used to treat solid tumours. Several toxicities limit FPs treatments, including myelosuppression, Hand-Foot Syndrome (HFS) and diarrhoea. Drug-drug and supplement-drug interactions can cause or worsen FP-related toxicity but they are often overlooked. Objective: To perform a systematic recognition of drugs and other compounds used in patients receiving FP-based therapy to identify potential adverse events associated to drug-drug and supplement-drug interactions. Methods: Pharmacological anamnesis was recorded in 43 patients receiving FP-based therapy. This recognition was performed besides pharmacogenetic testing, routinely performed to identify congenital dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficit associated to severe FP-related toxicity. All drugs and supplements were recorded and several drug-interaction checkers were consulted (Drugs.com, Drugbank, Medscape, WEBMD and Lexicomp. Last access 23 05th, 2022). Results: A careful recognition of oncological and non-oncological drugs and supplements was carried out by analyzing the records related to 43 patients submitted to clinical monitoring for at least 4 cycles of therapy. Of them, 35 were treated with 5-FU (4 were carriers of DPYD polymorphisms) and 8 with capecitabine. Patients carrying DPYD polymorphisms associated with DPD deficit were excluded from the analysis. Two out of 7 patients received a dosage of capecitabine of more than 2000 mg/m2 per day, which represents the maximum tolerated dose in case of a concomitant folate-based supplementation. Both patients experienced severe HFS and diarrhoea. In one case, capecitabine dosage reduction was executed and statin/ ezetimibe treatment was discontinued, while the folate supplementation was not suspended. In the other case, capecitabine and folate supplements were stopped and capecitabine was restarted after a month. Following these changes, severe toxicities were resolved.

703,"Introduction: Radical cystectomy (RC) is the standard of care for certain stages of bladder cancer (BC) [1]. Acute kidney injury (AKI), a complication of RC, is associated with increased mortality, largely due to chronic kidney disease and disease recurrence [2, 3]. In one study, 38.2% of BC patients developed AKI after RC [4]. Furthermore, AKI may preclude patients from anti-cancer therapy, potentially accelerating the rate of recurrence [5]. Objective: In this retrospective cohort analysis, two large US-based claims databases were used to assess the risk of AKI in BC patients who underwent RC. Methods: IBM MarketScan and IQVIA PharMetrics Plus claims data from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2020 were used to examine the occurrence of AKI in BC patients who had undergone RC. ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes were used to identify diagnoses and procedures. Patients were included if they: (1) had BC; (2) had a RC after their BC diagnosis; (3) were at least 18 years of age, and (4) had continuous enrollment (medical and pharmacy claims) of 12 months before the index date. The index date was defined as the date of RC. AKI occurrence after RC was identified from all inpatient claim records. Panalgo's Instant Health Data (IHD) healthcare analytics software was used to conduct the analysis.

Conclusion: In this retrospective study, both incidence and prevalence rates generated from the two databases were similar.

Objective: To assess the post-marketing safety profile of biological drugs approved in IMIDs using the Italian VALORE database network [5] and the national SRS database. Methods: Suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to biologics approved in IMIDs from four Italian regions (Veneto, Lazio, Emilia-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia-Giulia) were retrieved from the SRS database between 2010-2020. Safety Outcomes of Interest (SOI) related to the same biologics and person-years (py) of exposure were identified from the VALORE database in the same period and regions. Suspected ADRs were analysed at High Level Term (HLT) of MedDRA“ and stratified by drug class [TNF-a-inhibitors, interleukin (IL) inhibitors, and selective immunosuppressants]. ADR Spontaneous Reporting Rates (SRR) and SOI incidence rate (IR) were estimated using the total number of suspected ADRs and SOI as numerator and the exposure to biologics as denominator (among 100,000py). Results: A total of 2,675 ADRs reports were identified in the SRS database: 2,042 involved TNF-a-inhibitors (76%), 478 IL-inhibitors (18%) and 155 immunosuppressants (6%). Biologics users from the VALORE database were 74,046: 176,039py for TNF-a-inhibitors (72%), 35,666py for IL-inhibitors (20%), 13,039py for immunosuppressants (8%).",0.0,,False

744,"Introduction: The biological treatment which is the most effective type of therapy for inflammatory rheumatic diseases, has become part of a standard clinical rheumatology practice in recent years. Thousands of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, different forms of spondyloarthritides and with psoriatic arthritis are now successfully treated in this way (1), however they may be associated with a new spectrum of adverse drug effects (ADEs). Objective: identify the ADEs related to the use of biological drugs for inflammatory rheumatic diseases and also the impact of these ADEs on the treatment. Methods: This was a prospective descriptive, monocentric study of patients suffering from chronic inflammatory rheumatism, receiving biotherapy treatment and collected in the rheumatology departments. The data collection included the socio-demographic characteristics, the pathological profile of the patients, the treatment of the biotherapy received and the study of the adverse effects that appeared during or after administration of the biotherapy. Results: In total, 321 patients were identified between June 1 and August 31 2021, most of these received infliximab (27.4%), rituximab (17.4%), secukinumab (15.5%), golimumab (14.3%), adalimumab (12.4%), etanercept (7.1%), tocilizumab (3.4%). Of the 268 patients, 16 (4.3%) experienced one or more adverse effects related to biological agents. A total of 62.5% of the cases corresponded to women. Most of the adverse effects were classified as type B (58.2%) and A (18.7%), and 37.5% were serious cases. The most frequently reported ADEs were administration site reactions and skin effects (31.5%), nervous and gastro-intestinal system were also affected (25%), followed by cardiovascular disorders (12.5%). The drugs related to the significant number of ADEs were infliximab (37.5%) and rituximab (25%). Half of the patients who suffered from adverse effects switched to another biologic (50%), 43.75% of patients maintained the previous treatment, and 6.25% discontinued treatment. Conclusion: The adverse effects observed in this study had no impact on the functional or vital prognosis of the patient. This type of study can support decision makers in ways that benefit patient safety and interaction with health systems (2). References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,disease,True

756,"Introduction: Omalizumab is a humanized anti-IgE monoclonal antibody indicated for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria, IgE-mediated allergic asthma, and nasal polyps1. Despite its overall safety, a disproportionate analysis (case/non-case study) within VigiBase indicated that omalizumab might be associated with a significantly higher risk of malignancies (3) from 1,380 reports of neoplasms associated with omalizumab.2 The disproportionality signal was significant and positive, with a reporting odds ratio (ROR) of 1.65 which was particularly strong in breast and lung cancers. Objective: Therefore, we aimed to analyze the frequency of primary malignancy in omalizumab-treated patients in a real-world clinical setting through propensity score matching (PSM). Methods: We performed a retrospective case-control study in a single tertiary hospital to identify patients diagnosed with cancer after omalizumab treatment and a matching ratio of 1:4 was used to select omalizumab-untreated controls. Results: A total of 2,340 patients (468 patients in the omalizumab group and 1,872 in the omalizumab-untreated control group) were included in our study. Baseline serum IgE before starting omalizumab treatment was significantly higher in the omalizumab group than in the control group (Table 1). The morbidity rates of malignancy did not differ between the omalizumab group and the control group (2.35% and 2.94%, respectively). This difference remained insignificant after dividing the number of patients with malignancy by observation time to calculate cases per 1,000 person-years. Omalizumab treatment did not show any association with any type of primary malignancy.

765,"Introduction: Primary hypercholesterolemia, which is not adequately controlled with the continued use of statins at the maximum allowed dose is a serious problem in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events1. The new monoclonal antibodies alirocumab (Praluent ”) and evolocumab (Repatha ”) represent a further therapeutic option with demonstrated superiority over placebo and/or ezetimibe, in reducing LDL levels. Considering the potential chronicity of the treatment, dedicated pharmacovigilance studies are essential to define the longterm safety profile of these drugs. Objective: The aim of the study was to collect safety data, track adherence to therapy and identify specific drug interactions by paying closer attention to adverse reactions (ADRs) detection. Methods: The study included a 3-month enrollment phase, followed by a 6-month follow-up/monitoring period. Specifically, the Authorized Prescribing Centers identified the patients with prior informed consent, which were contacted by telephone within 15 days and then contacted again in the first month and at 3 and 6 months. All observed ADRs were included in the National Pharmacovigilance Network. In addition, the Morisky questionnaire was used to assess adherence to the therapy of the patients and the data were compared with the analysis of the therapeutic plans. The DIPS questionnaire was used to identify the interactions. Results: Overall, 79 patients (48 males and 31 females, mean age of 65.4 years) with a diagnosis of familial mixed hyperlipidemia (3.8%, 3), familial hyperlipidemia (29.1%, 23) and pure or common hyperlipidemia (67%, 53) have been enrolled.

Pre-recorded lectures are provided by leaders in the field of vaccinology while the weekly one-hour virtual discussion sessions are led by a trained facilitator. Results: Two sessions of the course have been successfully completed and a third is now in progress. Almost all enrollees have successfully completed the course with 29 graduates thus far and 15 enrolled in the current session. Surveys of participants have rated the course very highly in terms of content and relevance to their future work. Participants have also stated the course has provided them with increased confidence in becoming future DSMB members. Conclusion: It is possible to develop and conduct a hybrid virtual and live interactive course to train future DSMB members for vaccine trials conducted in LMIC.

800,"Introduction: In Argentina, a public institute produces and distributes biological substances that include different antivenoms based on equine F(ab')2 fragments for the treatment of accidents with snakes (bothrops, chrotalus, elapids) and arthropods (Loxosceles, Latrodectus, Phoneutria and Tityus). Currently, it has implemented a pharmacovigilance program that uses different sources of information and integrates them into a database to improve product safety analysis. Objective: To describe the particular methodology of the integration of information sources in a public producer of biological medicines. Methods: The institute integrates information from notifications of adverse reactions made directly to the institute (from patients, professionals, health coordinators and local health ministries), and forms of epidemiological report of accidents with poisonous animals. The different sources, available data fields and results of data integration are described. Results: Through the use of relational tables, concordance can be found between the epidemiological reports and the adverse reactions reports (using geographical area, date and type of accident reported). The integration of the databases makes it possible to quantify the frequency of adverse reactions and their individual case analysis allows the classification of reactions by seriousness, preventability, and to compare these data between regions. The cases of adverse reactions show a prevalence of 7.05 ± 1.3 (6.1-8.3)% over the total of patients treated with antisera, with slight variations between years and geographical areas. The description of the type of event allows classifying them as early reactions in 85% (nausea, vomiting, local reactions), and late reactions in 15% (serum sickness). Non-serious",1.0,area,True
801,"adverse reactions counted for 89%, being predictable in 87%, preventable in 94% and requiring medical treatment in 15% of cases. All of them evolved with ad-integrum restitution. Conclusion: Joining data using relational databases can allow the collection of additional information that allows not only to quantify the frequency of adverse reactions more reliably, but also to describe other factors that may be associated with changes in effectiveness and/or safety. The correlation with geographic areas and times between the occurrence of the accident and the administration of the product could serve to optimize the distribution process. This strategy helps to generate new information that is superior to the mere sum of the individual data. References/Further Sources of Information Beninger P. Pharmacovigilance: An Overview.

805,"Introduction: Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease that encompasses several clinical phenotypes and for which there has been much progress over the past 30 years in understanding the pathogenesis but for which there is currently no curative treatment [1]. Despite the frequency of switches in clinical practice, it is unclear which drugs are most frequently switched to and no clinical recommendations are available in this regard. Objective: Our study aims at providing evidence on patterns of biologic drugs use for psoriasis in Tuscany, Italy. Methods: We conducted a drug-utilization study based on administrative databanks of Tuscany (EUPAS45365). We selected new-users of etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, ustekinumab, or secukinumab between January 1st, 2011 and December 31st, 2016. We considered subjects with psoriasis and followed subjects until end of study period (three years), or patient's death, whichever came first. We censored subjects for pregnancy or neoplasia. For each subject, we defined the state as the weekly coverage of one of biologic drugs of interest. We then defined the switch as the change from a state to another one. Results: A total of 7062 subjects with a first dispensation of PSObio drug in the inclusion period was identified. We included 1839 psoriatic patients (52.9% females, 51.6 mean age), resident in Tuscany, with one year of observation before the first biologic dispensation, and three years of observation after the first biologic dispensation. Among new users of adalimumab (N ,"" 770, 41.9%), one third showed a continuous behaviour, the others moved to etanercept and ustekinumab.

814,"Introduction: Biosimilars are biological medicines of rigorous pharmaceutical standard quality, that can provide benefits for patients in terms of safety, efficacy and quality, for healthcare systems as well in increasing treatment alternatives, access and cost competitiveness [1]. Objective: To evaluate the safety reports of subcutaneous biosimilars of adalimumab (ADA) and etanercept (ETN), the two biological pillars of rheumatology, by considering the patients therapies and safety signals collected in the local center. Methods: A three years period analysis was considered after the introduction of the first biosimilar of ADA (2019) and ETN (2017): the safety reports occurred in this period were analyzed after being reported in the AIFA National Pharmacovigilance Network (RNF) database [2]. Patients biological scheme assessments were defined by using an internal accounting system of provided drugs to outpatient and home regimen patients. Results: Etanercept was the first biosimilar subcutaneous anti-TNFa introduced in the rheumatological center: the switching practice was embraced for the 23.1% of patients (n , 93) and the biosimilar prescription was adopted for the 26.2% na®ive patients (n ,"" 105). The safety signal rate of ETN biosimilar/originator (0.6) was in favor of the biosimilar; 25% of the events were considered serious, with no difference between biosimilar and originator. Drug ineffectiveness was recorded both for originator and biosimilar with different rate (60% and 41.7% respectively), proving that the poor control of the disease should be independent by the drug formulation itself. The second generation biosimilars of adalimumab were introduced into the clinical practice much more incisively, thanks to the raising physician confidence acquired with ETN. The 37.7% of patients (n "", 283) in ADA originator were switched to biosimilar and the 47.7% (n , 358) received biosimilars as first-line therapy.

Conclusion: From what emerges from the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the adverse reactions reported in the RNF, there are no specific safety concerns or clinically meaningful differences in the use of biosimilars [3]. Indeed, doctors are increasingly supporting biosimilarity/interchangeability, combined with an appropriate level of communication with patients, that can enhance the biosimilars contribution to sustainability and patient therapy access [4].

861,"Introduction: Polydactyly is the most common congenital anomaly of hand and foot. It is characterized by extra fingers or toes and it can occur as part of a syndrome or as a separate event [1]. Objective: To report a case of congenital polydactyly in a baby born from a mother affected by multiple sclerosis (MS) in therapy with ocrelizumab. Methods: We performed a prospective analysis of the relationship between the use of drugs modifying the course of MS, and the risk of serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The case was reported in the Italian National Pharmacovigilance Network (RNF) as serious event [2]. We performed an analysis of the number of ADRs occurred to pregnant women receiving ocrelizumab, through a comparison between the RNF and the Eudravigilance database [3]. Results: The mother is a 42-years-old Senegalese woman, affected by MS since 2014. She also suffers from bronchial asthma, atopic eczematous dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, obesity. On 2016 the woman delivered a healthy baby; during her first pregnancy she didn't receive any SM therapy. After 2 years of treatment with fingolimod, on January 2019 doctors switched to ocrelizumab (intravenous infusion, 600 mg every 6 months). The last infusion was in November 2020, and in January 2021 she got pregnant again. Therapy was discontinued and the baby was born in good health by vaginal birth on Oct. 2021 but had polydactyly in his hands and feet. Doctors are now considering amputation surgery. From the year of ocrelizumab authorization (2018) to date (30/04/2022), 5 other ADRs regarding ``congenital, family and genetic diseases'' and ``pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal disorders'' have been reported in the RNF [2] and 57 ADR in Eudravigilance [3]. According to an EMA Assessment report, 46 patients receiving ocrelizumab became pregnant during clinical study participation. Among these, 11 cases reported a spontaneous fetal loss and 9 cases reported premature delivery and/or an abnormal finding in a live born baby [4]. Conclusion: Pre-clinical studies do not indicate teratogenic effects of ocrelizumab, but there is some evidence of these effects in humans. Ocrelizumab Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) indicates to adopt a contraceptive method during the treatment and for 12 months after the end of therapy. Naranjo's algorithm did not exclude the causal relationship between the adverse event reported in this abstract and the therapy with ocrelizumab, defining it as ``doubt''.

870,"Introduction: The rising incidence of Crohn's Disease (CD) led to a significant increase in biologics therapy. Due to their recent development, the long-term risk/benefit profile of these therapies is still not completely defined. Therefore, pharmacovigilance activities become essential to monitor their safety. Objective: The purpose of this prospective pharmacovigilance study was to evaluate safety of biologics for the treatment of CD. Methods: All patients treated with at least one biologic drug in gastroenterology centers located in Calabria between January 2019 to April 2021, were enrolled, including both biona®ive and previous biologics exposed patients. Demographic and clinical characteristics including age, sex, diagnosis, comorbidities, type of drugs used, discontinuation or switch/swap to another biologic and AEs were collected. Each patient was monitored for 6 months at least, since the date of enrollment (follow-up period). AEs were analyzed through mapping with the PT (Preferred Term) and SOC (System Organ Class) codes of MedDRA dictionary. The most common AEs were detected and reported. Results: A total of 163 patients were enrolled, of which 116 (71.2%) were biona®ive: mean age (± SD) was 39.7 (± 13.6) years; 58.3% were males. At the index data, infliximab (IFX) was the most and widely used in study population (44.8% of patients), followed by: adalimumab (ADA) (38.7%), vedolizumab (VED) (11.0%), ustekinumab (UST) (5.5%). During the follow-up, the 15.3% of patients reported at least one AEs related to biologics administration (Total AEs reported: 35). The most common AEs were ``general disorders and administration site conditions'' (34.3% of total AEs); mainly, asthenia in patients treated with IFX (7 patients) and ADA (1). Injection site reaction (1), flushing (2), oedema (1) were also reported in patients treated with IFX. ``Nervous system disorders'' occurred in 17.1% of cases, which included: 3 reports of headache (2 IFX, 1 ADA), 2 of somnolence (1 IFX, 1 UST) and 1 of confusional state (IFX). We also detected 5``musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders'', such as arthralgia, in patients treated with IFX. In all cases, the most common AEs, belonging to three different SOC, occurred in the hours immediately after administration and resolved within 24/48 hours. Only one patient treated with IFX reported persistent headache that requires further neurological examination. Conclusion: Results showed that the highest incidence of AEs was related to infusion reactions. Indeed, the majority of AEs resolved within a maximum of 2 days after administration of biologics. However, further studies are needed to address the questions about the long-term safety of biologics. References/Further Sources of Information Not applicable.",1.0,Disease,True

875,"Introduction: Biological drugs have made important advances in the treatment of many inflammatory diseases. With their increasing use in real life, post-marketing activities became crucial for evidence on their long-term safety. Objective: Aim of this active pharmacovigilance study was to evaluate the safety of biologics in bio-na®ive patients affected by psoriasis (Pso), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and atopic dermatitis (AD). Methods: A prospective analysis of patients with dermatological diseases, na®ive to biologics, in the period 2019-2022 was carried out. All bio-na®ive patients treated with at least one biologic drug in dermatology centers located in Calabria were enrolled. Demographic and clinical data have been collected for each enrolled patient: age, sex, diagnosis, disease duration, current biologic drugs, biosimilar drugs, other treatments, relevant comorbidities, switch/swap, potential failure, and adverse events (AEs) onset. Results: The study sample consisted of 521 patients: 47% with PsA, 49.5% with Ps, and 3.5% with an AD. Mean age (± SD) was 54.5 ± 13.4 years and 59.1% were male. Mean age at diagnosis was 45.6 ±15.4 and the mean disease duration was 11.8 ± 9.1 years. The most prescribed drug was Adalimumab (ADA) 36.6% of which the 6% were biosimilar drugs, followed by etanercept (ETN) 22.3% which the 12.8% were biosimilar drugs, ustekinumab (UST) 15.9%, secukinumab (SEC) 10.7%, golimumab (GOL) 4%, dupilumab (DPL) 2.6%, infliximab (IFX) 2.5%, ixekizumab (IXE) 2.4%, tildrakizumab (TIL) 0.9%, guselkumab (GUS) 0.7%, risankizumab (RZE) 0.7%, brodalumab (BRO) 0.5%, tocilizumab (TCZ) 0.1%, and abatacept (ABT) 0.1%. Regarding safety, overall, 417 patients (80%) not reported AEs, whereas patients 20% experienced at least one AE, mostly due to ADA (39.4%). The most frequent identified AEs were general disorders, in particular: asthenia (26%), injection site reactions (14.4%), headache (13.4%), skin disorders and gastrointestinal disorders (6.7%); all the AEs observed were expected. Conclusion: Considering the low rate of AEs reported, our data seems to confirm a good safety profile of biologics. The reported AEs have been generally mild to moderate and mostly related to general disorders and administration.

This oral treatment has demonstrated significant clinical advantages, but rapid tumor debulking can lead to a treatment-related risk of the acute condition known as tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), caused by the abrupt release of cellular components into the bloodstream [2].",1.0,clinical,True
883,"A warning has been issued by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) and Italian Medicine Agency (AIFA) regarding the risk of TLS in patients treated with venetoclax [3]. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate whether a disproportionally elevated signal of developing TLS may be detected in patients treated with venetoclax as compared to those treated with other drugs. Methods: A retrospective analysis of spontaneously reported cases of TLS contained in the free and publicly available FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database was conducted in the period January 2015-December 2020 [4]. We calculated, as a signal of disproportionality, the reporting odds ratio (ROR), and the relative 95% confidence interval (CI), of TLS in patients treated with venetoclax. The signal was considered significant when the ROR lower limit of the 95% CI was [ 1. Results: A total of 11.800.647 FAERS reports were identified during the study period; 15.933 (0.13%) reports mentioned venetocalx.

Potential psychiatric adverse events have been described only in few cases. Objective: To investigate the relationship between the onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms and the use of anti-TNF alpha drugs. Methods: We describe the case of a patient with no history of psychiatric disorders that experienced secondary depression on anti-TNF alpha with positive rechallenge. Results: A 57-year-old woman was diagnosed with axial ankylosing spondylitis associated with psoriasis and started on etanercept, which was stopped for paradoxical uveitis and substituted with adalimumab, one injection every 15 days. She presented 15 days after the fourth adalimumab infusion, mood disorders with black ideas, negative thoughts, neglect of her appearance and insomnia. These symptoms resolved within 20 days of stopping treatment. She was put under infliximab, and had presented from the first day a recurrence of the depressive syndrome with auditory hallucinations that have disappeared 15 days after stopping this drug.

897,"Introduction: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) is characterized by a type 2 pattern of inflammation resulting in the production of some cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL5, and IL13. Options for treatment-resistant CRSwNP include aspirin desensitization, recurrent topic and systemic corticosteroid use, and functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). However, frequent relapses after medical and surgical treatment have been observed. Thus, dupilumab, a human recombinant monoclonal IgG4 antibody, changes radically the treatment of CRSwNP because of its binding effects on major drivers of human type 2 inflammatory processes [1-",0.0,,False

Objective: The aim of this study was to describe better adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to dupilumab in the treatment of CRSwNP analyzing all individual case safety reports (ICSRs) collected into the European Spontaneous Reporting System (SRS) database. Methods: All ICSRs recorded starting from the drug approval up to 31 December 2021 with dupilumab reported as suspected and having the specific indication of CRSwNP were considered. A descriptive analysis was conducted to assess demographic characteristics and dupilumab-related variables. Results: Out of 10,400 ICSRs related to dupilumab, only 481 (4.6%) had CRSwNP indication, of which 68.2% were related to adults and 54.3% to females. The 68.4% were serious; however, ICSRs mainly led to a completely or partial recovering (25.4%) and 8 cases were fatal (1.7%). The time to onset (TTO) of ADRs was 25 (1-84.75) days while the time to resolution (TTR) was 5 (1.75-15.75) days. Analyzing ADRs by System Organ Classes (SOCs), the most reported were general and administration site conditions (36.4%) followed by injuries (21.6%), infections (21.2%), respiratory (19.1%), skin (16.6%), and nervous system disorders (16.4%). Looking at Preferred Terms (PTs), arthralgia (7.3%), eosinophilia (6.9%), COVID-19 (6.0%), pyrexia (5.8%), asthenia (5.6%), rash (5.4%), and dyspnoea (5.2%) were the most reported. The 7.5% of ICSRs described an aggravated condition with persistent nasal polyps: in 4 cases (0.8%) a nasal polypectomy was required. Considering fatal ICSRs, two cases were related to progression of COVID-19, one to road traffic accident, one to accidental death and the others were not fully specified. Conclusion: These results showed that dupilumab-related ICSRs are not commonly reported in CRSwNP. However, given the good treatment response and the minimal adverse effects observed, clinicians should consider treating CRSwNP with dupilumab. Moreover, additional analyses are necessary to better outline the safety profile of dupilumab in this particular setting. References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,case,True

As suggested by AIFA, for the last 8 reports, additional information was requested. In 5/8 cases, through additional information, 4/5 reports were evaluated like disease progression attributable to the drug itself. For Apremilast, by the clinical information, the progression of the disease was not attributable to the drug, rather to its physiological progression. Therefore, the report was sent to the AIC Holder, and not recorded in the RNF, like AIFA document. In 2022, up to 30 April, 3 reports were received for ineffectiveness (2 biosimilar Adalimumab;1 Guselkumab),supported by the reporters information.

MUE is a systematic and interdisciplinary performance improvement method with an overarching goal of optimizing patient outcomes via ongoing evaluation and improvement of medication utilization (5). Methods: The electronic health record identified of patients who received Lenvatinib between January 2020 and November 2021 were reviewed. Results: A total of 28 patients were identified. Most of the patients used the Lenvatinib as a first or second line. Lenvatinib was used as monotherapy in 10 cases while as combination therapy in 18 cases: with pembrolizumab, everolimus or nivolumab.

Three patients received Lenvatinib for non-FDA/non-EMA approved indications, including cholangiocarcinoma and metastatic melanoma (in combination with Nivolumab). Oncologists chose to start with lower doses than approved ones in 57 % of patients. Despite that, nearly 90 % of patients had multiple-dose reductions due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) development. 60% of the patients were still alive during the review period; 82 % of them (14 out of 17) still receiving Lenvatinib while 18 % (3 out of 17) progressed. Unfortunately, 22% (6 out of 28) deceased while 18 % lost follow-up. Mortality was within less than or equal to 30 days post Lenvatinib initiation in one patient with HCC. A total number of 26 ADRs were identified. All ADRs were documented by Clinical pharmacists. The most-reported ADRs were cardiovascular and dermatological followed by endocrine ADRs.

949,"Introduction: Several drugs such as lithium, beta-blockers, adrenergic antagonists, and interferons can aggravate pre-existing psoriasis or cause de novo psoriasis. Few cases of psoriasis were described with interferon be^ta-1b. Objective: Herein we report a rare case of interferon be^ta-1b induced nummular psoriasis that occurred in a multiple sclerosis patient with positive rechallenge. Methods: This case was reported in August 2020 and evaluated according to the French imputation method of causality assessment. Results: A 39-year-old woman with no medical history of skin diseases has started interferon be^ta-1b for her multiple sclerosis. After one month of daily use, she presented a generalized erythroderma and secondary diffuse erythemato-squamous coin-sized lesions evocative of nummular psoriasis. The patient denied any recent infection or stress. The evolution was favorable 20 days after drug withdrawal with corticosteroids treatment. After full recovery the rechallenge was attempted and the same symptomatology recurred one month later after the onset. Conclusion: We suspected that interferon was the causative agent in the induction of psoriasis. The imputation score was likely due to the evocative delay of psoriasis occurrence, the favorable outcome after drug withdrawal, and the positive rechallenge. Activation of psoriasis is an uncommon side effect of drugs and could mimic other cutaneous diseases in its rare features [1]. Physicians taking care of sclerosis patients should be aware of this affection which need careful evaluation of an added morbidity. References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,case,True

She was initially put on ciclosporin and methotrexate without improvement. Treatment with etanercept at a dose of 50 mg/week was then initiated with good cutaneous and articular evolution. After 15 months of treatment, the patient presented an amputation of the left temporal visual field with, on ophthalmological examination, a visual acuity of 8/10, a fundus examination without abnormality with no signs of papillary edema on angiography and a present and symmetrical photomotor reflex. The visual evoked potential, cerebral-medullary MRI, lumbar puncture and the immunological and infectious work-up were without abnormalities. The diagnosis of optic neuritis was retained, etanercept was stopped and evolution was marked by the recurrence of the cutaneous and articular symptomatology with resolution of the visual disorders (visual acuity at 10/10). Later reintroduction of etanercept was marked by reappearance of visual disorders. Conclusion: Optic neuritis remains a serious visual complication. Therefore, a visual field test before and during etanercept treatment is recommended. References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,infectious,True

1009,"Introduction: A drug-related problem (DRP) is defined as ``an event or circumstance involving drug therapy that actually or potentially interferes with desired health outcomes''.[1] Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are more susceptible to DRPs due to comorbidities and polypharmacy.[2,3] Objective: This study aimed to investigate the types, characteristics, severity, causes, most common involved drug classes, and risk factors for DRPs in hospitalised patients with CKD. Methods: A prospective follow up study was conducted in one of the largest teaching hospital trusts in England examining adults C 18 years with a diagnosis of CKD (stage 1-4) hospitalised in medical and renal wards from November 2021 to April 2022. This study reviewed patients' records, prescriptions, laboratory tests' results to identify DRPs. Identified DRPs were classified according to Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe (PCNE) v 9.0 classification system and assessed by an expert panel for severity and preventability. Potential risk factors of DRPs were tested using logistic regression statistical analysis. Results: Three hundred and seventy-eight patients were included in this study with a mean age of 74.1 and a median of 78 (IQR 67-87). Females represented 54% of the sample, with polypharmacy present in 86% of patients. A total of 375 DRPs were identified in 240 patients (64%) with an average prevalence of 1.56 per patient.

1017,"Introduction: Experiencing adverse drug reactions (ADRs) may impact the patient's well-being and attitude towards their therapy with medicines. It has been demonstrated that the majority of patients who discontinued drugs reported a very high burden of ADRs [1]. How patients experience the burden of ADRs may be explained by several factors. Insight in these factors can help healthcare professionals (HCPs) to optimize the guidance of patients through their drug therapy. Objective: To explore factors that are associated with a high, or low to moderate patient-experienced burden of ADRs. Methods: A web-based prospective cohort design was used to collect information on patient characteristics and their experienced ADRs on non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) through four questionnaires. The experienced burden of ADRs was asked using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not burdensome) to 5 (extremely burdensome). Burden scores 1 to 3 were considered as low to moderate burden, and burden scores 4 and 5 as high burden. To identify associated factors for the burden of ADRs, we performed backward stepwise selection to create a logistic regression model. Factors included in the analysis were: gender, age (\ 70 or C 70 years), type of NOAC, previous vitamin K antagonist use, self-managing NOAC use, consulting a HCP, (considering) withdrawing the NOAC, hospitalisation, haemorrhagic ADRs, the amount of ADRs (\ 4 or C 4), and outcome of the ADR.

Along with aspirin, it represents the mainstay in the management of patients suffering from myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and atrial fibrillation [2]. However, clopidogrel therapy is not always efficient or safe since the possible outcomes range from complete resistance to treatment to major bleeding events [3]. Objective: The aim of this study was to provide the analysis of genetic and non-genetic factors that influence clopidogrel efficacy and safety in cardiology patients. Methods: We have conducted a prospective study in 200 hospitalized patients. CYP2C19 genetic testing was conducted, and the PREDICT score was calculated in 102 out of 200 patients treated with clopidogrel in order to determine the influence of genetic and non-genetic factors on outcomes of interest.

1036,"Introduction: The treatment of head and neck cancer (HNC) currently recommended consists of chemotherapy with cisplatin concomitant with radiotherapy. However, cisplatin treatment is frequently associated with renal adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (1), impacting patients' quality of life; besides, as traditional biomarkers have low sensitivity and specificity (2,3), there is currently a search for new ones. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate miRNAs as possible biomarkers of cisplatin-induced renal ADRs in HNC patients. Methods: Massive sequencing was performed using urinary miRNAs from HNC patients, collected 5 days after cisplatin chemotherapy. To assess the expression of miRNAs, a comparison was made between the case and control groups (6 patients with nephrotoxicity and 6 without nephrotoxicity, respectively); differential expression was analyzed by GeneGlobe (Qiagen) and normalized by DESeq2. Based on the results of sequencing and analysis of the current literature, 6 miRNAs were selected (hsa-miR-6729-5p, hsa-miR-1238-5p, hsamiR-4706, hsa-miR-6805-5p, hsa-miR-4322 and hsa-miR-21-5p) to",1.0,case,True

In this validation stage, the expression profile of these miRNAs was compared between the case and control groups (composed, respectively, of 24 participants with renal ADRs and 25 participants without); the relative expressions were evaluated by the 2-DCT method. Results: The results obtained in the validation stage showed that, except hsa-miR-6729-5p, all other miRNAs showed a tendency to be upregulated in the control group before and after chemotherapy when compared to the case group. Some miRNAs resulted in remarkably high fold regulation (FR) values (1. hsa-miR-6729-5p--baseline: FR ,"" 11.8, p "", 0.5958; D5: FR ,"" 4.1, p "", 0.6306; 2. hsa-miR4706--baseline: FR ,"" - 1.3, p "", 0.4843; D5: FR ,"" - 26.7, p "", 0.8623) and others were smaller but still relevant (3. hsa-miR1238-5p--baseline: FR ,"" - 2.4, p "","" 0.1170). However, although a difference in expression was found between the groups for all miRNAs, this difference was not significant. Conclusion: Renal ADRs are still an obstacle to the effective therapy and quality of life of patients treated with cisplatin. The preliminary results of this work show that some miRNAs tend to be elevated in patients without ADRs, therefore they could be protecting against the induction of renal injury; however, in order to possibly help the clinician in the evaluation/choice of chemotherapy treatment for these patients, further studies are still needed and in a larger number of patients.

Results: A total of 85 patients with NSCLC, treated at Clinics of Hospital Unicamp, the most with an average age of 63 years, men (55%), Caucasians (85%), accentuated smokers (35%), abstainer (35%), with performance status (KPS) at 100% (88%) and with adenocarcinoma (63%). Observed that 72% of patients had an hematological ADRs, grade 1 anemia was the most prevalent. 61% had a grade 1 gastrointestinal ADRs: nausea (25%), vomit (8%) and diarrhea (18%). Hepatic ADRs (59%) grade 1 hepatic ADRs was observed in 59%. Renal ADRs grade 1 was observed in 74%, the most prevalent were: reduced creatinine clearance (28%), Hyponatremia (24%), and Hypocalcemia (18%). In the gene ABCC2, was observed heterozygosity (CT) in 56%, 28% homozygous CC and 15% homozygous TT in the population studied, those with genotype CC had more hematological (54%) and renal (44%) ADRs when compared to the others genotypes, the polymorphism were in the HardyWeinberg equilibrium. Conclusion: Patients in this study has a high prevalence of hematological and renal ADRs. The finding suggests that patients who are homozygous (CC) for the gene ABCC2 (rs717620) are at increased risk for hematologic and renal ADRs if compared to the other genotypes (CT ? TT).

1073,"Introduction: Older patients, representing a frail population, are at a high risk of falling because of age-related changes in multiple physiological systems. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths in elderly individuals [1]. Cardiac arrhythmias affect a large proportion of the world's population and are frequent within the older population [2]. Amiodarone is one of the most effective and commonly prescribed antiarrhythmic drugs. It has a very long plasma half-life and undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism via several CYP enzymes [3]. Its toxicity profile is broad, potentially affecting various organs. Amiodarone may interact with other clinically important drugs. The mechanisms of its drug interactions could be the change of pharmacokinetics (mainly by inhibition of hepatic metabolism), or pharmacodynamics of co-administered drugs [4]. Objective: To review the risk of falling with amiodarone in older patients. Methods: A quantitative analysis of data in VigiBase, the WHO global database of suspected adverse reactions of medicinal products. Results: As of 3 May 2022, VigiBase included 378 cases reporting the MedDRA preferred term ``Fall'' and the substance amiodarone as suspected or interacting agent. After de-duplication and removal of irrelevant reports, 279 reports remained for analysis. Most reports (n ,"" 270; 97%) concerned patients aged 60 years or older. The patients' median age was 81 years, ranging from 60 to 96. In 108 cases (39%), amiodarone was reported as the only suspected drug. Most patients received more than one drug with a median of two drugs being administered concomitantly, ranging from one to fifteen medicinal products. The event ``Fall'' was reported to occur in median six months after start with amiodarone treatment, with a wide range between days to years. However, information about the time-to-onset was reported only in a limited number of cases. A subgroup analysis comparing patients with and without polypharmacy was performed (see Table 1). Median time-to-onset was remarkably shorter and fatality was higher in patients receiving more than five drugs.""",1.0,clinical,True

Lipids ADRs was determined using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Genomic DNA was extracted and purified from peripheral blood using a Wizard“ Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The CYP genetic variation were studied with Taqman“ (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA), determined by rt-PCR. The project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (83192918.9.0000.5404). Results: Thirty-nine patients aged 29.7 ± 10.0 years were enrolled in the study, mostly men (64.1%), Caucasians (82.1%), and single (64.0%).

Several factors including malnutrition, fasting, HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, dose size, pharmacogenetic polymorphisms, hepatic cirrhosis, and substandard medicinal products alter Moxifloxacin exposure and/or efficacy Results: Renal impairment has no significant influence on Moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics when dosed at 800 mg/day. The mean maximum concentration of drug in serum and the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24 h) is 3.2 mg¡L-1 and 29.2 mg h¡L-1 maximum (peak) concentration is an independent predictor of sterilizing activity and therapeutic drug monitoring at 6, 12, and 18 h post-dose may aid in optimizing dosing to achieve the recommended moxifloxacin concentration of C 29 mg/L. A higher Moxifloxacin Cmax is required for severe forms TB such as TB meningitis, with Cmax C 35 mg/L and area under the concentration- time curve (AUC) from time zero to 6 h (AUC6) C 7 mg¡h/L associated with reduced mortality. Conclusion: Further studies are needed to confirm whether doses achieving exposures higher than the current standard dosage could translate into faster sputum conversion, higher cure rates, lower relapse rates, and less mortality. It is interesting to discover that daily Moxifloxacin dose of up to 800 mg/ 70kg were found to be safe and well-tolerated over a period of 3 months. Higher -dose Moxifloxacin may be considered in future studies when examining potentially and shorter regimens and markers of efficacy like AUC/MIC (Minimum inhibitory Concentration) and AUC/MIC should equally be examined.

1121,"Objective: To verify a relation between circulating miRNAs and hematologic adverse reactions caused by treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel in lung cancer patients. Methods: This study was approved by the ethics committee no. 83196318.8.0000.5404. Blood was collected from patients before and 15 days after chemotherapy, for hematological adverse reactions analysis, for MicroArray and for qPCR validation. Adverse reactions were classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 [4]. The MicroArray was performed with plasma from 6 patients without and 6 patients with hematological adverse reactions. Three miRNAs identified by MicroArray were validated via qPCR using 20 patients without and 26 with hematological adverse reactions. Bioinformatics analyses were performed by miRwalk, DAVID and GeneMani. Results: Patients with lung cancer treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel are mostly white, with a mean age of 63.50 years, retired, with low schooling, heavy smokers, not eligible for surgical resection, with histopathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and stage 4. We observed a high prevalence of grades above 0 for anemia (44%). The MicroArray of patients with and without hematological toxicity verified 9 differently expressed plasma miRNAs among these patients. Of these 3 were chosen for validation being miR-1273g-3p, miR3613-5p and miR-455-3p. Only miR-455-3p showed a significant expression reduction (p ,"" 0.04) between the groups, before chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. The bioinformatics analysis of hsa-miR-455-3p showed an important relationship of this miRNA with the hematopoiesis pathway, especially with action on the RUNX1 and TAL1 genes. Conclusion: The most prevalent adverse reactions in lung cancer patients treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel were hematological, especially anemia. This adverse reaction, caused by a dysfunction of the hematopoietic system, can be explained by a possible relation between important genes in this system, RUNX1 and TAL1, and hsamiR-455-3p.

1130,"Introduction: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death worldwide [1]. Gefitinib is a first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that has consistent clinical benefit in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with the activating mutations of the EGFR gene. However, dermatological adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are common in patients receiving gefitinib [2,3]. ABCB1 gene variants may be associated with skin rashes [3,4]. Objective: To investigate associations between ABCB1 transporter allelic variants with dermatological ADRs in patients treated with gefitinib. Methods: This is a cohort study that included patients with NSCLC receiving oral geftinib (250 mg/day). DNA was isolated from whole blood samples. Genotyping was performed by TaqMan“ using realtime PCR. For the ABCB1 gene, dbSNP-ID rs1045642 (C3435T) and rs1128503 (1236T[C) were studied. Dermatological ADRs (cutaneous rash, maculopapular rash, and hyperpigmentation) were evaluated after 8 weeks of TKI use and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. Results: Eighteen patients were included with a mean age of 63.0 ± 11.0 years, mostly women (55.5%), Caucasian (83.2%), and nonsmokers (66.6%). Stage IVA (50.0%) was the most observed. Moreover, 72.2% had EGFR exon 19 deletion and 27.7% had EGFR exon 21 mutation. The two ABCB1 variants studied were in HardyWeinberg equilibrium. For rs1045642, AG heterozygous was observed in most patients (41.1%); 29.4% of patients showed GG and AA homozygous genotypes. For rs1128503, AG alleles were also predominant (64.7%); AA and GG homozygous genotypes were observed in 17.6% of patients. The most observed ADR was hyperpigmentation (grade 1: 44.4%; grade 2: 11.1%). Also, 33.3% and 11.1% of patients showed grade 1 and grade 2 cutaneous rash, respectively. For rs1045642, AA homozygous individuals showed a higher prevalence of cutaneous rash (80%) when compared to AG ? GG genotypes (25%), similar to that observed for rs1128503. For rs1045642, maculopapular rash was more frequent in AA homozygous individuals (60%) than in AG ? GG group (33.3%), similar to that observed for rs1128503. Only for rs1128503, it was possible to observe a higher prevalence of hyperpigmentation in the AG ? GG group (57.1%) when compared to the AA homozygous patients (33.33%). Conclusion: This study suggests the possibility of a association between AA genotype and the presence of rashes, for both dbSNP-ID in ABCB1 gene.

1141,"Introduction: Multiple comorbidities and altered pharmacokinetics are common in patients with CKD, which can have long-lasting consequences on quality of life.[1,2] Understanding the nature of medication prescribed for co-morbidities, and the monitoring they require, is essential for safe prescribing practice and to avoid drugrelated problems (DRPs) in CKD. Objective: This study aims to describe the drug utilisation patterns of in-hospital CKD patients, with reference to the World Health Organisation (WHO) drug use indicators.[3] Methods: An observational follow up study on the drug utilisation pattern was conducted in hospitalised CKD patients over five months (November 2021 to April 2022) in a large teaching hospital in England. The study included hospitalised patients C 18 years with CKD and followed them until discharge. WHO core drug use indicators were evaluated. Prescribed drugs for each patient were recorded on a data collection tool prepared for the purpose of this study and all drugs were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System. Polypharmacy (C 6 drugs) risk factors were assessed with univariable and multivariable logistic regression using STATA 17 Software. Results: During the study period, 387 patients were included in this study, with mean (SD) age of 75 (± 15.5). Over half were female (n ,"" 208 54%). The mean (SD) number of drugs per patient was 11 (± 4.9), the percentage of patients requiring a prescription of an antibiotic was 61.8%, the percentage of patients requiring a prescription of an injection was 93.5%, the percentage of drugs prescribed by generic name was 90.2%, and the percentage of drugs prescribed from essential drugs list or formulary was 88.9%. The most frequent drug groups prescribed were: Alimentary tract and metabolism (22%), Cardiovascular system (18.7%), and Blood and blood forming organs (17%). Longer hospital stay (P\0.001), admission to a renal ward (P "", 0.02) and number of comorbidities (P \ 0.001) were independently associated with polypharmacy.",1.0,,True
1142,"Conclusion: In this cohort of CKD patients, we found mixed compliance with the WHO drug use indicators. There was relatively good compliance with drug formulary use and with generic prescribing, but a high number of drugs prescribed. As might be expected more complex patients with longer stays, and multiple co-morbidities had a higher chance of polypharmacy with the potential for increased DRPs. Further work should investigate prescribers' views on prescribing in CKD patients. References/Further Sources of Information",0.0,,False

Treatment of locally advanced HNC is based on radiotherapy concomitant with high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy, which is limited by the occurrence of severe toxicities [1,2]. Regarding cisplatin-induced adverse reactions, mainly in the kidney, there are considerable interindividual differences. Several aspects are considered to explain the different grades of adverse reactions and outcomes of the same treatment, and in this scenario, pharmacogenetics stands out. Genetic factors may include polymorphisms that affect the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin [3,4].

Blood samples were collected from patients with HNC treated at the Clinical Oncology Outpatient Clinic of a tertiary teaching hospital in Brazil, before (baseline) and after cisplatin administration (80-100 mg/m2). Ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four transporter genes ABCB1 (rs1045642, rs1128503, rs2032582 C[A, and rs2032582 C[T), ABCC2 (rs717620, rs2273697, and rs3740066), OCT2 (rs316003 and rs316019), and MATE1 (rs2289669) were selected to investigate their associations with renal adverse reactions. Genotyping was conducted by quantitative PCR using TaqMan probes. Renal adverse reactions were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0. Multivariate Logistic Regression analyses were performed with SPSS v.27 and a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (number 69402017.1.0000.5404). Results: Ninety-five patients were enrolled in this study, with a mean age of 58.00 ± 7.71 years; most patients were male (90.5%). A low creatinine clearance was observed after the first cycle of cisplatin, affecting 40.0% of patients in grades C 2 (4.44% with grades 3 and 4), accompanied by ionic imbalances, even after prophylactic intravenous hydration. Associations were observed between the SNPs of the ABCB1 (rs2032582 C[A) and ABCC2 (rs3740066) genes with cisplatin-mediated renal adverse reactions. ABCB1 rs2032582 C[A wild type allele was significantly associated with hyponatremia in grades [ 1 (P ,"" 0.045, OR "", 3.398). ABCC2 rs3740066 wild type allele was significantly associated with increase in serum creatinine in grades [ 1 (P ,"" 0.010, OR "", 31.18). The other SNPs were not associated with renal adverse drug events. Conclusion: ABCB1 rs2032582 C[A and ABCC2 rs3740066 might be potential clinical markers for predicting cisplatin-induced renal adverse reactions.

1163,"Introduction: The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) utilises various AEFI reporting tools to monitor vaccine safety in the country. In 2020, SAHPRA in collaboration with the National Department of Health's (NDoH) Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI), joined the African Union Smart Safety Surveillance programme, as one of four pilot countries, to introduce an electronic adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) reporting system (Med Safety App) for healthcare professionals and consumers [1]. On 17/05/2021, the NDoH introduced its national COVID-19 vaccination programme. SAHPRA launched a microsite during 2021, to provide feedback to the public on AEFI with the COVID-19 vaccines. Objective: To provide an overview of COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance and describe causality assessment outcomes for serious AEFI reported during the first year of COVID-19 vaccine administration. Methods: All severe and/or serious AEFI are investigated by provincial EPI surveillance teams, followed by causality assessment conducted by the National Immunisation Safety Expert Committee (NISEC), using the World Health Organization (WHO) methodology [2]. Causality assessment outcomes are classified based on the final diagnoses determined during the assessment by NISEC according to WHO categories, seriousness, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class and patient demographics. Data were collected retrospectively from the SAHPRA COVID-19 AEFI microsite and the EPI national AEFI database. Results: By 01/04/2022, 33,063,221 COVID-19 vaccine doses had been administered, with 5 815 spontaneous AEFI reports (0.0173%) submitted. Of these, 2,571 (0.008%) were reported as serious. Spontaneous reporting of AEFI increased significantly compared to pre-COVID-19 vaccine introduction. The most frequently reported AEFIs were side effects already listed in the product information. No safety concerns were raised based on causality assessment outcomes for 273 serious cases analysed by 01/04/2022.

1175,"SSNHL (trauma, infections,...), the range and the month of vaccination, the delay of onset of SSNHL, associated symptoms (dizziness and tinnitus), the degree of hearing loss and the outcome. Audiogramm and/or medical reports were requested in order to guarantee a better informativeness of data. All cases were reviewed by a staff including two pharmacologists and two otorhinolaryngologists. All cases with a delay onset[30 days were excluded. Cases were split in ``well completed'' and (non completed) based on the availability of audiogram and medical reports. Results: A total of 250 cases were recorded during this period for the 2 vaccines (60 Spikevax/190) (23 cases excluded because of other reasons or missed data). 226 cases were analyzed and will described according to over mentioned criteria, corresponding to 151 cases classed as ``well completed'' (31 Spikevax/120 Comirnaty). The estimated incidence of SSNHL was estimated as 0.18/100000 for serious cases for Comirnaty and 0.27/100000 for both serious and non serious cases for Spikevax. For Spikevax, the median age was 50 years with a sex ratio of 0.9, the half of cases occurred after D1, 5 cases of positive rechallenge and hearing loss was associated with tinnitus in 50% and dizziness in 21.6%. For Comirnaty, the median age was 56 years with a sex ratio of 0.8, 76% of cases occurred after D1, 1 case of positive rechallenge, associated with tinnitus in 84% and dizziness in 39% of cases. Conclusion: In our knowledge, it is the first study analysing all cases of mRNA vaccines-induced SSNHL supporting by audiogram analysis. This adverse effect remains rare but should be considered in patients with audio-vestibular risk factors. Other studies would be necessary in order to understand the mechanism which remains unclear.

It was designed to ensure infrastructure for effective monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines. The Croatian Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices (HALMED) saw this as an opportunity to upgrade existing ADR e-reporting system (OPeN) and set up post-marketing active surveillance of adverse drug reactions (ADRs).

1185,"Methods: For the purpose of data collection defined by the ACCESS protocol, OPeN system has been upgraded to incorporate an informed consent, survey tool, survey data report, direct reporting of AEFI reports, when applicable, and their transmission to EudraVigilance.To participate in the study an user account needs to created and consent given. Study participants access the system via the appropriate link. The system is protected by a firewall and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. Data protection has been established for both internal and external users. Results: The first phase of the OPeN upgrade started in November 2020 and finished in February 2021. The inclusion of participants in the Croatian study began on 12 February 2021. In the first phase, only healthcare professionals could participate, but the variation in protocol allowed that from April 2021 all vaccinated people could be included. With second phase of upgrade, we were able to include additional questions on relevant medical history, pregnancy, 3rd and booster vaccine dose. 374 vaccinees were recruited in the period from start until the end of April 2022. Almost all vaccinees were adults. Majority were female (77%), and average age was 38 years-old (SD 10, CI ± 1). Total of 303 AEFI reports were collected, of which 97% were non-serious. Conclusion: The OPeN system has shown a wide upgradeability and HALMED was able to establish a system of post-marketing active surveillance in very short time frame as addition to our routine pharmacovigilance activities. However, throughout this process we have identified several issues: time consuming multi-step registration process, not enough user friendly interface and insufficient promotion of the OPeN system. Nevertheless, since this was the first time HALMED performed prospective safety monitoring by using a webbased tool we find results encouraging for future activities.

It is characterized by well-defined, erythematous, indurated scaly plaques, with predilection of extensor surfaces, the scalp and the nails. It may be caused by drug, infection, stress, physical trauma, and vaccination. COVID 19 vaccines have recently been linked to worsening of pre-existing psoriasis. Objective: We report an exceptional case of new onset of psoriasis following COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: This case was reported in February 2022 to The National Centre of Pharmacovigilance and evaluated according to the updated French method of causality assessment. Results: A 58-year-old female patient with a past medical history of hypothyroidism treated by sodiclevothyroxin received on 07 August 2021 her first dose of VAXZEVERIA COVID-19vaccine.

1194,"Introduction: Although the mechanism of neurological complications after COVID-19 vaccination has not been precisely explained, it could be attributed to the inflammatory state triggered by COVID-19 vaccine as in the course of COVID-19 viral infection. This condition induces disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in combination with vascular endothelial dysfunction, leading to stroke of the large vessels. This hypothesis may be the main cause of DIC, especially in mRNA-based vaccines, whose mechanism involves delivery of the mRNA code of the spike protein to human cells. Cellular synthesis of the spike protein stimulates the immune system to recognize and store it for future attack. Based on this hypothesis, the inflammatory state triggered by the vaccine can be considered the main pathway for neurological complications of COVID-19 vaccine. Objective: The aim of this work is to analyse the incidence of ischaemic stroke risk following administration of the ComirnatyTM vaccine in ASST GOM Niguarda, an Italian hospital based in Milan, and to compare it with data from FAERS database. Methods: The Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) was calculated in order to evaluate a possible correlation between the risk of ischaemic stroke and ComirnatyTM vaccine administration in the period of JanuaryDecember 2021. For this purpose, we consulted FAERS public domain database that allows you to search information relating to adverse events reported to the FDA. Results: From reports of adverse events of ComirnatyTM vaccinated patients at ASST GOM Niguarda hospital, it was observed that after administration of this vaccine there is a correlation with the risk of developing ischaemic stroke mainly in over 65 years old patients (OR , 1.26; 95% CI 0.17-9.13; z , 0.230; p value , 0.8182) when comparing the data with other vaccines.

1212,"Introduction: Although the International and National Regulatory Authorities encourage COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women [12], the scientific evidence supporting maternal exposure to COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy is still limited and further studies are needed to monitor their safety profile in order to evaluate the potential consequences in both mother and child. Objective: We aimed to investigate Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) with COVID-19 vaccines that occurred after maternal exposure during pregnancy. Methods: We retrieved Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) following maternal exposure to COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy from the EudraVigilance database of the European Medicines Agency during the year 2021. We investigated outcomes related to the mother and child age groups (defined as fetus, infant, and neonate). The Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) was computed to compare the reporting probability of spontaneous abortion between each COVID-19 vaccine and all other COVID-19 vaccines. Results: During the study period (1 January 2021-31 December 2021), among 1,315,315 ICSRs related to COVID-19 vaccines, we retrieved 3,252 (0.25%) reports of AEFI that occurred after maternal exposure during pregnancy.

We also observed that 5.8% (n "","" 188) of cases reported a fatal outcome, 17 of them were clearly associated with the mother, while 171 with the child. Conclusion: We did not observe any strong insight into any unknown adverse events associated with COVID-19 vaccination. However, we analyzed data related to only one year of the vaccination program. Therefore, our experience also highlights the need for continuing to monitor the safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines and to identify longterm adverse events following immunization.

Methods: Clinical records of those patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 at the Emergency Room in Rebagliati Hospital in Lima, Peru, during March 2021, were carefully revised. To establish diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and causality assessment, the criteria of DILI-Expert Working Group and the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences/Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (CIOMS/RUCAM), respectively, were used Results: Out of 327 patients identified, 38 took ivermectin as selfmedication (11%); of those 38, five were diagnosed with liver injury presumably related to that medication (13.2%). The mean age of those patients who developed the condition was 49.3 (12.3) [men, 4; woman, 1]. The mean (standard deviation) of Tomographic Severity Score (TSS), C-reactive protein, ferritin levels, Lymphocyte count and D-dimer were 52.2% (22.6), 13.8 (12.2) mg/dl, 1325.375 (239.7072) ng/ml, 2.0 (2.0) K/ll and 0.9 (0.7) lg/ml. The patients had no identified risk factors, but two; one patient had type I diabetes mellitus, and other, obesity. Mean daily ivermectin dose, duration, and total ivermectin dose were 32.9 (21.8) mg/day, 2.6 (0.6) days, and 89.6 (71.4) mg, respectively.

1271,"Introduction: The Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant vaccination programme has seen greatly increased discussion of adverse drug reactions (ADR) and how to report them, and non-healthcare professions have submitted many more ADR reports. Various barriers have been proposed to influence the reporting by patients [1, 2] and patients' motives to report have also been discussed [3]. We investigated differences in COVID-19 vaccine ADR reporting rates within this region to identify factors that may influence the number of reports received from patients. Objective: To identify factors which may influence the number of reports received from patients Methods: The West Midands Centre for ADRs receives data from Yellow Card reports that are generated in the Midlands NHS region (population 6.6 million) in the UK. We compared the rates of ADR reporting by patients with COVID-19 vaccination rates and indices of deprivation [4] in the 12 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs)-- areas with populations ranging from 0.13 to 1.38 million. We ranked CCGs by number of patient reports to COVID-19 vaccines and",1.0,pandemic,True
1272,"compared these with the rankings of the number of vaccines received and each of the domains of deprivation using Spearman's rank correlation. Results: In the period 9/12/20 to 31/12/21 there were 30,874 patient reports from the region (83% of all COVID-19 vaccine reports). Reporting rates per CCG ranged from 167 to 307 (mean 240) per 100,000 vaccinations administered, with a mean of 2.00 (range 1.69 to 2.14) vaccines per person--the UK at this stage was part way through the booster campaign with only adults routinely vaccinated.

1273,"Conclusion: ADR reporting rates had, perhaps unsurprisingly, a strong correlation with high vaccination rates. However, higher deprivation, lower education levels, and more unemployment were all negatively correlated with patient ADR reporting to COVID-19 vaccinations, echoing similar findings in professionals ADR reports from deprived areas. [5] The experiences of adverse effects that patients from lower socio-economic groups have are likely to have been less well recorded than those of more wealthy and educated groups. This may have implications for the design and availability of ADR reporting forms and for the assessment of ADRs more generally. References/Further Sources of Information 1.

1281,"Introduction: Digital media are integrated in our daily routine, play a critical role in the dissemination of health information and disease prevention guidelines and are becoming more impacting in pharmacompanies activities, with an increasing trend after the pandemic period. They pose pharmacovigilance challenges for application of PV rules. a structured approach is needed for pharmacovigilance departments in the new digital scenario. Objective: The SIMeF pharmacovigilance working group worked on digital topic since two years, addressing it in a structured way: from a a specific survey (1), to proposals for addressing the needs underlined, to seminars and events for capability building and discussions among experts. SIMEF group also worked on a proposal guideline for supporting PV departments (6), suggesting a framework for managing sponsored digital activities with potential collection of adverse events, to provide useful operative suggestions on PV requirements management. Methods: A research on the regulation in force and the current status of digital media was conducted, with a focus on pharmacovigilance, privacy and quality aspects. The guideline was written considering the expertise of the authors in the management of pharmacovigilance activities. Seminars were done to favour discussions among experts. Results: All healthcare sectors are impacted by digital media: scientific societies, academic institutions, patients' associations, hospitals and healthcare institutions are increasing their online presence 2,3. Social media are used by patients to compare health data, collect treatment information and discuss with physicians, with an increasing active role. Digital media should be considered as a potential source of AEs by pharmacompanies, when managing sponsored activities. PV aspects of digital activities are currently described, although not in details, in different regulations by EMA, FDA and MHRA. Management digital projects by pharmacompanies is complex and require a structured multifunctional process, to guarantee a holistic approach to regulatory and legal requirements. Many aspects should be considered for compliance and efficiency. SIMeF work pose considerations on the importance of crossfunctional work, early pharmacovigilance advice, tracking system, execution of risk-based assessment, escalation to quality, SOPs presence, personnel trainings (including vendors) and a Quality System covering PV. New skills and capability will be crucial for PV departments in future. Conclusion: Digital media are powerful instrument to increase patients and physicians involvement and to support disease knowledge. The rising amount of safety data generated through digital opens a challenge for pharmacompanies. This work is a starting point to trigger broader discussions around PV quality system for digital activities.",1.0,disease,True

1293,"Introduction: One of the known adverse reactions among long-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) users, especially the elderly, is that it increases the risk of community-acquired pneumonia [1]. The probable mechanism is that the increase in gastric pH produces a decrease in elimination or an increase in colonization of bacteria; PPIs promote the proliferation of bacteria in the mouth and oropharynx and would increase in this manner the risk of pneumonia [2]. In COVID-19, lungs are particularly at risk. Currently, there is a great interest in establishing the relationship between the severity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients using PPIs [3]. Objective: To explore the relationship between the previous use of PPIs and mortality due to COVID-19 Methods: A retrospective observational study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital in Lima, Peru.

1305,"If we want to maintain this vaccine coverage ratio, we must verify whether parents agree to vaccinate their children because they are convinced of the efficacy and safety of vaccines, or because it is mandatory? Objective: To determine the prevalence of hesitancy among Egyptian parents towards routine immunization for their children by using the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Vaccine Hesitancy Survey Tool [2]. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 410 of parents between December 2021 and April 2022 in Cairo, Egypt. A WHO validated questionnaire was used consists of 13 questions designed to measure parents' hesitation towards vaccinations. Results: Of 410 families screened, No parent had ever refused a vaccination, and only 4 parents (0.97%) had been reluctant or hesitated to get a vaccination for their children. Parents either with higher or moderate educational levels were strongly agree that childhood vaccination is important for child health (p \ 0.001). No doubts or concerns related to vaccine safety have been reported and this has been mainly due to the presidential national immunization initiatives to increase Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) coverage. Its worth to mention, Egypt announced that it was completely free of polio in 2006, and this was due to these presidential campaigns, which gave greater confidence in the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Conclusion: To maintain high levels of immunization, healthcare professionals should be kept on the same level of awareness with vaccine safety and vaccine risk communication to keep the trust of the population with the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Because when high immunization rates are reached and sustained in the population they generate herd immunity to protect communities. In addition, the mass media played an active role as it has covered the results of these presidential campaigns, which has increased parents' confidence in these vaccinations. Finally, Egypt must continue with this successful approach of encouraging the vaccination. References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,vaccine,True

Data was collected via a telephonic survey and additional clinical information was provided by the health institution Unisalud. Description of the AEFIs in the population and the characteristics of the people with adverse events was analyzed. Results: A total of 3,764 persons were included, 35.73% reported AEFIs from which around 8.55% (115/1,345) experienced them 5 days after immunization. AEFIs tended to have low or medium intensity (70% on a 5 Likert scale, from very low to very high) and a duration between 1 and 3 days (65.1%). The vaccine with fewer AEFIs was Sinovac and was statistically different from Pfizer and AstraZeneca (using Tukey HSD and 95% confidence). Conclusion: The percentage of AEFIs is consistent with findings in active monitoring programs. Risk factors coincide with other studies. This study demonstrates high rates of AEFIs in the population differing by brand. Serious events were rare. This study contributes to the knowledge of AEFIs for vaccines only used in middle and lowincome countries. The active monitoring program of UNAL gives very relevant and reliable information.

1322,"Introduction: Falsified medical products may contain no active ingredient, the wrong active ingredient, or the wrong amount of the correct active ingredient [1]. The prevalence of falsified medicines spans from 1% in developed settings to 10% in the Global South [2]. Due to broken supply chains, strong demand for medicines and limited capacities of law enforcement, the COVID-19 pandemic created the optimal conditions for the falsified medicines' market to expand. Objective: Aim of this abstract is to present evidence about the surge in counterfeit medicines amid the COVID-19 crisis. Methods: This review examines the existing published scientific literature and peer-to-peer networks, grey literature as well as briefs and policy reports on counterfeit medicines amid COVID-19 pandemic. Results: According to EOCD, People's Republic of China and India are the primary producers of counterfeit medicines, with the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Hong Kong (China) serving as transit economies [3].

1323,"COVID-19-reated medicines, due to the medical supply restrictions related to the pandemic. These restrictions have been introduced by local authorities (e.g. supply restriction for Chloroquine and Azithromycin) or occurred because of air traffic reduction. Over 60 countries have implemented export restrictions and 25% of restricted products were medicines [4]; (ii) E-commerce as a relevant platform for substandard medicines. For instance, advertisements of illicit COVD-19-related medical products have been reported on social media platforms, such as Instagram. According to the industry, online distribution becomes predominant and about 50% of purchases of illicit medicines are done on-line [5]; (iii) weak regulatory frameworks, including insufficient technical capacity, constrained access and ineffective over-sight to address substandard and falsified medical products. WHO reports that 30 per cent of national regulatory authorities do not have full effective capacity to perform their functions [6]. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic has increased the vulnerability to counterfeit medicines, leading to serious damage to the health of individuals or failure to treat their medical needs adequately. The abstract identifies three relevant governance gaps (increased demand, E-commerce and weak regulatory frameworks) to be further addressed in dedicated fora.

1344,"Introduction: During the strengthened Covid-19 vaccine safety surveillance, the Moroccan pharmacovigilance center has collected a higher number of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) reports. More than half of the Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) collected in the National pharmacovigilance database since its creation are linked to Covid-19 vaccines [1]. Objective: To assess the impact of the inclusion of the AEFI related to Covid-19 vaccines on the measures of disproportionality in the National pharmacovigilance database. Methods: Measurement of disproportionality by the calculation of the Reporting odds ratio (ROR) [2] for the ``Drug-Effect'' pairs collected at the National pharmacovigilance database (data from March 16, 2022) with and without inclusion of Covid-19 vaccines. Using ``VigiLyze'' (Uppsala Monitoring Center) we calculated the RORs and exported to ``Excel'' the list of ``Drug-Effect'' pairs for which the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of the ROR is greater than 1. Then, on the list obtained, we recalculated by Excel the RORs after excluding the Covid-19 vaccines from the database. Results: Among the 69,814 cases of adverse effects recorded in the National pharmacovigilance database from March 16, 2022, 36,541 cases (52.6%) concerned Covid-19 vaccines (Table 1). The measurement of the disproportionality showed that 88% of the RORs increased and 5% decreased after inclusion of Covid-19 vaccines in database. The median of the ROR change factor following this inclusion (RORCovid vaccines included/RORCovid vaccines excluded) was 2.1 (1.8-2.1); this can be explained by the higher proportion of Covid-19 vaccines cases (half of the database). Also, the degree of this influence depends on the frequency of AEFI to Covid-19 vaccines. Thus, the ROR had decreased with inclusion of cases of covid-19 vaccines for most common reactions and had been multiplied by a factor more than 2 for the low-reported reactions with Covid-19 vaccines.",1.0,vaccine,True

1355,"Introduction: Several neurobiological mechanisms have been proposed to support the hypothesis of a higher COVID-19 risk in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) [1]. Since the end of 2020 EMA and FDA, among others Agencies, issued Emergency Use Authorization for COVID-19 vaccines, approved for prevention of COVID-19 disease [2]. Safety of these vaccines are monitored in all countries. In USA, spontaneous reports are collected in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), that is freely accessible [3]. This continuous and intense safety monitoring is needed to enable a timely evaluation of the benefit/risk profile of COVID-19 vaccines to ensure the benefit of vaccination continues to outweigh risks. Objective: To evaluate suspected adverse reactions following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines in persons with ASD reported to VAERS. Methods: This study analyzed VAERS reports of suspected adverse reactions following vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen COVID-19 vaccines until 04/Mar/2022 in children, adolescents and adults with ASD. Reports were analysed by age, sex, seriousness, type of vaccine (manufacturer), dose, onset interval, length of hospitalisation and outcome. Results: Eighty-seven reports have been retrieved from VAERS. The most affected age group is between 18-29 years with a higher percentage distribution in males than in females. Seventy-six (76%) reports were related to non-serious events, thus, he most frequent reactions reported were expected: fever, pain at the injection site and headache. Other adverse reactions are rare and unexpected including febrile seizure and eye rolling. Two cases of amonorrhea were also observed. Among the 11 serious cases, 6 (6.90%) were hospitalized; 2 (2.30%) were reported as life-threatening and 2(2.30%) caused permanent disability. Death was reported in one case, occurrin few hours after the vaccination. At the time of the reporting, the patients presented concomitant medical conditions, treated with various product medications, who contributed, therefore, to the onset of events. Conclusion: The number of cases reported to VAERS and related to suspected adverse reactions in individuals with ASD does not suggest a safety concern attributable to authorized COVID-19 vaccines at this time in this special population.",1.0,COVID-19,True

These antisera were developed by the National Institute for the production of Biologicals (ANLIS-Malbra¥n) and distributed free of charge in public hospitals in the country. Objective: The aims of this study (NCT04913779) is to analyze the efficacy and safety of a passive immunotherapy strategy using hyperimmune equine serum known as Anti-SARS-CoV-2 elaborated by the National Institute for the Production of Biologicals (ANLISMalbra¥n) as an addition to the standard therapeutic approach for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Neutralizing activity in plasma was correlated with drug concentration. Daily controls were carried out including physical examination, questioning in relation to symptoms presented, and blood extraction for routine laboratory control. No patient reported symptoms consistent with adverse reactions. Although some patients presented mild laboratory alterations (hepatogram, urea, creatinine), in all cases they were alterations that existed prior to the administration of the research product and that improved after treatment. Conclusion: Despite the small number of patients studied initially, and the possible masking of an adverse event due to the underlying disease (COVID-19), no significant adverse reactions were evidenced during treatment with the research product. There were no serious reactions and the pharmacokinetic characteristics appear to show a long-acting profile correlated with neutralizing activity in vitro.

In the context of COVID-19 healthcare emergency, self-medication is likely to have been increased for prevention or treatment of perceived infection. Objective: To assess self-medication in general and in the context of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among Romanian patients during December 2020-March 2021. Participants were recruited through patients' associations (email, Facebook groups). Those who agreed to participate to the study were directed to an online questionnaire. The in-house developed questionnaire was anonymous, consisting of 42 questions assessing knowledge, attitudes (using Likert scale) and practice regarding self-medication and it was pretested for adjustments in a community pharmacy in 14 patients. Results: A total of 398 participants (77.1% female), with most (64.8%) in the age category of 35-64, responded to the survey. The majority were urban residents (84.9%), having under and postgraduate studies (63.1%). More than half (57.3%) reported having chronic disease.

Objective: To study the common systemic AEFIs and factors influencing them, using self-reported data by Iraqi consumers vaccinated with different COVID-19 vaccine types. Methods: As a part of the national plan for COVID-19 vaccines safety surveillance, an online self-assessment form was designed by the national pharmacovigilance center for the public consumers across the country. The form was quadrilingual and captures the necessary information for a valid AEFI report. Demographic data, contact details, vaccination details, adverse event information, and medical history were collected. To facilitate the filling process and standardize the answers, a list of predefined common short-term AEFIs were included as a checklist, in addition to a free text for other unlisted AEFIs. A retrospective cross-sectional study using the collected responses from April, 2021 until April, 2022 was performed. Data was validated and cleaned.

1387,"Introduction: Covid-19 pandemic has impacted all areas of human society worldwide, including drug regulatory authorities. Enormous public interest and seriousness of the disease resulted in boom of new medicines for treatment and prevention of Covid-19. Patients and healthcare professionals (HCP) concerns on safety of these new medicines resulted in the highest increase in the reporting rate of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the history of the Czech Republic (CZ). Objective: To present how the PV processes were affected by Covid19 pandemic. To present the impact of increased reporting rate and related workload on the national PV system in Czech regulatory authority (SUKL) and the influence on awareness of ADRs reporting in the Czech public. Methods: In 2020, the total number of ADRs (n ,"" 2904) reported to SUKL was the lowest in the past 5 years (2016-2020). The probable cause may be the Covid-19 pandemic, including the lack of time for HCP to report ADRs. Results: On the contrary, in 2021 (1) with the entry of the treatment and prevention of Covid-19 into the clinical practice, there was a massive increase in reported ADRs in CZ. Of the total number of reported cases (n "","" 13 759), 81.10 % (n "", 11 159) were vaccinerelated (all types of vaccines). Of these vaccine-related ADRs 95.27 % (n ,"" 10 631) were reported for Covid-19 vaccines only. Considerable interest in vaccine safety in CZ is evident, resulting in high number of suspected ADRs reported following vaccine administration. Conclusion: Due to the significant increase in the ADRs reported, the national PV system had to be adapted. A system of triage of case reports was set including pre-assessment of seriousness by PV assessors. More staff had to be hired and trained to assist with the case processing, including receipt of the report, HCP confirmation of patient reports, follow-up and hospital records requests. To satisfy an extensive media attention and to increase transparency of vaccine safety, SUKL published an overview of reported ADRs on weekly basis (2) and communicated the most serious concerns online, together with EMA recommendations. Czech PV assessors were deeply involved in all European procedures related to Covid-19 treatment (e.g., remdesivir) and prevention (vaccines). The Czech public became more aware of the possibility of reporting ADRs, the number of reports will be presented. Based on reporters  suggestions the online reporting form for ADRs was re-designed. This experience has been challenging and brought new approaches and improvements to the national PV system. References/Further Sources of Information""",1.0,pandemic,True

It is generally accepted that the world will not return to the pre-pandemic normally situation until safe and effective vaccines become available. However, the rare and unknown adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) are not usually detected in the clinical trials. Thus, monitoring the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in real-world population is essential. Objective: To perform a post-marketing safety surveillance of AEFIs of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: A prospective cohort study conducted and followed subjects who received COVID-19 vaccines from the first day of vaccination for seven days after the first and second doses, then biweekly for three months. All vaccinee demographic information, vaccine type, co-morbidities, concomitant medications and AEFIs were collected by phone through a standardized online questionnaire. Baseline characteristics and AEFIs were analyzed descriptively by SPSS software. AEFIs were classified according to medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Results: 544 subjects of 8867 agreed to be part of the study. Among them 218 subjects completed the study, of them 110 individual were male (50.5%) and 108 (49.5%) were female; the median age was 33 year.

1402,"Introduction: Remdesivir, has been evaluated in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in several clinical trials, then it has been used in routine care since the European approval in this indication. Objective: The main objective of the RESPIR'Nantes study was to describe the clinical outcome and safety of patients treated with remdesivir in real life. We chose here to focus on safety outcomes. Methods: To describe the safety, we considered adverse events (AEs), based on those reported to date in the Summary of Product Characteristics and potential post-marketing signals from the international pharmacovigilance database Vigilyze“. AEs were classified according to the System Organ Class (SOC) of the Medical Dictionary of Adverse Events terminology. The AEs of SOC ``hepatobiliary disorders'' and ``renal and urinary disorders'' being the most reported to date, a detailed analysis was performed Results: A total of 76 patients were included in the study from March 13 to December 31, 2020. The most common AEs were metabolism and nutrition disorders, hepatobiliary disorders, gastrointestinal disorders and renal and urinary disorders. Patients with hepatobiliary disorders had mainly include transaminases increases and 60% had pre-existing hepatobiliary disease that worsened during treatment. The median time to onset or worsening of hepatobiliary disease was one day [1-2]. It led to discontinuation of treatment in one case. Among patients with renal and urinary disorders, 50% had increased blood creatinine levels prior therapy initiation. The median time to onset or worsening of renal and urinary disorders was one day [0-16]. It led to discontinuation of treatment in two cases. Conclusion: A potential signal of pharmacovigilance has been identified for liver and renal disorders in Vigilyze“ and we have reported the expected remdesivir Aes. However, it is difficult to suspect remdesivir only without considering the pathology itself, but remdesevir appears to have favorable safety profile in patients who require minimal supplemental oxygen.

The rate of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) following Covid-19 vaccination categorized as ``serious'' by the reporters is approximately 35% in Switzerland and thus significantly higher than e.g. in the US (6.6%), while rates of reports with fatal outcome are comparable (1.4% vs. 1.3%) (1). A high proportion of the cases labelled as ``serious'' in Switzerland was classified based on the category ``medically important''. Since this criterion is used very commonly but is less distinct than the other seriousness criteria, we aimed to analyze whether it is used correctly by the reporters and whether differences between healthcare professionals and patients/consumer can be identified. Objective: To evaluate the appropriate usage of the seriousness criterion ``medically important'' in spontaneous ADR reports submitted by health care professionals compared to non-health care professionals following immunization with a Covid-19 vaccine. Methods: All serious ADR reports received between the 1st of January 2021 and 31st of December 2021 following immunization with a Covid-19 vaccine were extracted from the Swiss database. Cases categorized as ``medically important'' were further analyzed. We extracted the preferred terms (PT) according to the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) (2) of the reported ADRs and matched them with the important medical event terms list (IME list) (3). Results: From a total of 11,115 ADR reports, 4,125 (37.1%) were classified as ``serious''. 2,773 (67.2%) of the serious cases were reported by HCPs and 1,352 (32.8%) by non-HCPs. In 2,260 (55%) reports, the seriousness was based solely on the criterion ``medically important''. 755 (33.4%) of these reports would also be classified as ``serious'' according to the IME List. 498 (39%) reports by HCP and 257 (26%) by non-HCP match with the IME list. The proportion of correctly categorized ADRs is significantly higher (p \ 0.0001) in reports from HCPs compared to non-HCPs. Conclusion: Only approximately one third of the cases, which were classified as ``medically important'' and thus reported as ``serious'', would also be classified as such according to the IME list. The proportion of correctly categorized ADRs is significantly higher in reports from HCPs. Additional information and training for HCPs appears necessary to achieve a higher rate of appropriate seriousness categorization in ADR reports. The usage of the category ``medically important'' in reports by patients/consumers requires general revision. References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,case,True

1418,"Introduction: In the face of the global health emergency due to SARS-CoV-2, Ivermectin has been, among other drugs, repurposed in some Latin American countries to treat COVID-19 [1]. Studies are needed on the safety of Ivermectin for this new indication. VigiBase is the WHO pharmacovigilance database that registers all Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) from more than 130 countries. Objective: To review in VigiBase the reports of serious hepatic disorders in adults associated with the use of Ivermectin for COVID19. Methods: We extracted, in men or women aged C 18 years between 1 January 2020 and 7 march 2021, all ICSRs registered as ``serious'' associated with the use of ivermectin, and established the prevalence of serious hepatic disorders when Ivermectin was indicated for COVID-19 Results: During the study period, there were 1,393 ICSRs in VigiBase associated with Ivermectin, of which 60 (4.3%) were registered as ``serious''; in 25 of those, Ivermectin had been used for COVID-19. Out of those 25, five reported serious cases of hepatic disorders (hepatitis, hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, increased alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, abnormal liver function test). Three patients were male and overall mean age was 59.2 ± 9.7 years. Ivermectin was administered during a mean of 2.5 ± 2.4 days, and the mean daily dose was 14.3 ± 2.9 mg. Two patients simultaneously received other drugs (Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin). Two patients had concurrent conditions (strongyloidiasis, diabetes mellitus). Only in 2 patients liver enzyme data were reported. In all patients the evolution was favorable after stopping the drug (de-challenge), and no patient was re-exposed (rechallenge). Causality analysis was reported in 3 cases, qualifying as possible or probable. Conclusion: The safety of the use of Ivermectin should be studied more exhaustively, especially as regards the probability of hepatic disorders when used for COVID-19 References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

Objective: To evaluate the implementation of strengthened monitoring of vaccines and therapeutics used in COVID-19. Methods: Potential signals detected on vaccines and drugs used in COVID-19 following the implementation of new pharmacovigilance tools and methods were analysed. Results: As of March 31th, 2022, more than 140 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines administered with more than 150,000 adverse reactions reports, 45 monitoring committees held and 43 potential signals of COVID-19 vaccines have been transmitted by ANSM to European authorities to reinforce or initiate a signal. As of January 26, 2022, more than 2 300 adverse reactions reports collected for treatment used for patients with COVID-19, 21 monitoring committees held and 3 signals were identified. Conclusion: The use of tools and methods in COVID-19 vaccines and medicines monitoring have allowed for early detection of signals and implementation of appropriate risk minimisation measures. This has been made possible thanks to the whole organization of strengthened surveillance which remains agile along the pandemic crisis. Furthermore, facilitation was given to accelerate evaluation, methods to prioritize a large volume of spontaneous reports, and different channels to communicate transparently in order to build trust among stakeholders. There are still challenges to build a new era of surveillance concerning the management of a large number of adverse drug reports, expertise and communication in a daily routine.

1435,"Introduction: Pericarditis and myocarditis have been recognized as rare adverse drug reactions of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines of Pfizer and Moderna [1,2]. Most cases are observed in young males within 5 days following the 2nd dose and the course is often mild. The estimated excess risk is about 1-3 per 100,000 vaccinated persons, whereas the risk ratios following Sars-CoV-2 infection are 5-18 for myocarditis and pericarditis respectively [3]. Few studies indicate an increased risk of myocarditis with the 1st dose of the vector vaccine of AstraZeneca [4]. General incidence of myocarditis is 10-20 per 100,000 personyears and young men are at increased risk. Incidencerates of pericarditis are not exactly known, since the condition is often self-limiting and underdiagnosed [5]. Objective: We evaluated the use of Standardised Morbidity Rates (SMR) to compare spontaneously reported cases of myocarditis and pericarditis with COVID-19 vaccines with stratified Dutch background incidence rates from 2019 in the vaccine exposed population. Methods: SMRs are calculated by dividing the reported as observed (O) cases by the expected (E) number within risk windows of 5/14 days following each dose and vaccine. SMR [ 1 indicates that more cases were reported than expected [6]. Results: Until January 2022, 373 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis were received. The majority of the cases was reported following an mRNA vaccination (85%), mostly following the second dose (47%). The mean age for men and women was 34.7-45.1 years for myocarditis and 45.2-46.6 years for pericarditis. The mean times to onset (TTO) for myocarditis and pericarditis with the 1st and 2nd doses are about three weeks, with a wide range. Median TTO show a latency of 5 days for myocarditis and 9-14 days for pericarditis. Six patients died following myocarditis or pericarditis. In the table, SMRs for myocarditis within 5 days are summarized, stratified for vaccine, dose, sex and age. For pericarditis, SMRs show a similar pattern, and more reports were received than expected in men and women \ 40 years with all doses of Pfizer, in men \ 40 with Moderna, in men \ 40 and women [ 40 with the first dose of AstraZeneca and in men who received the Janssen vaccine.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Lareb managed to monitor TTS cases closely by a fast triage of relevant reports and strong collaboration with external specialists. Objective: Spontaneously reported cases of TTS in The Netherlands are described. Methods: We used CDC classification criteria combined with Dutch guidelines to determine confirmed and strongly suspected cases. CDC classification recognizes `tier 1' with thrombosis at unusual sites not requiring tests and `tier 2' with common types of thrombosis and requiring confirmatory tests [6]. Results: In total, 75 cases of thrombocytopenia with any kind of thrombosis were reported. Only 26 reports met criteria of TTS, concerning 19 AstraZeneca, 5 Janssen and 2 mRNA vaccines. The majority (23; 89%) of the cases was reported following the first dose. Reporting rates for AstraZeneca and Janssen were 7.7 and 5.7 per million vaccinations in total, respectively, and 13.4 per million vaccinations of the first dose with AstraZeneca.

1483,"Introduction: Undertaking effective drug safety monitoring can be particularly challenging in low-resource settings due to a lack of infrastructure, weak regulatory systems and poor access to training and education [1]. Given the continued impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having upon health systems globally, it is essential to ensure that pharmacovigilance systems in these vulnerable settings have the capacity to address both the exacerbated pre-existing and novel challenges that they now face [2]. This project seeks to harness the membership of an online pharmacovigilance platform, globalpharmacovigilance.org (GPV) to work together in a `community of practice' (CoP) on specific challenges facing pharmacovigilance during the pandemic [3, 4]. Objective: To gather consensus on pharmacovigilance priorities in low-resource settings during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide resources to address them using a CoP model. Methods: This project has built on a consensus-gathering methodology developed by The Global Health Network that has been implemented successfully during the pandemic to address wider COVID-19 research priorities. An online survey of GPV members was used to identify highly-ranked areas for pharmacovigilance improvement in low-resource settings during the pandemic. A virtual workshop was then hosted to invite further discussion on the survey results and reach consensus on the highest priorities. Members of the CoP were next invited to form virtual working groups, each focussing on one of the top 3 priorities identified. These groups are being supported by GPV to work together and facilitate the development (or provision, if pre-existing) of pharmacovigilance resources to address the priorities identified. Results: Of the 43 pharmacovigilance `themes' that were presented to the CoP membership in the initial survey, 3 topics were identified as the highest priorities at that point in the COVID-19 pandemic, where support, training and guidance are needed; `The safety of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy', `The safety of COVID-19 vaccination in children/adolescents' and `Analysis of COVID-19 vaccine safety data'.

Conclusion: A CoP model represents an effective method of consensus gathering amongst pharmacovigilance stakeholders at a global level, and allows rapid identification of healthcare priorities during public health emergencies. It is anticipated that working groups outputs will include the provision of resources designed to address the priorities identified. References/Further Sources of Information",0.0,,False

Pharmacists have a suitable position in the process of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reporting of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. Objective: To assess the engagement of pharmacists in the pharmacovigilance process related to the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: A systematic search of the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar was carried out for relevant articles published between December 2020- April 2022, reporting the engagement of community, clinical and hospital pharmacists in the ADRs reporting process during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this systematic review the following keywords were used: ``COVID-19'', ``pharmacists'', ''drug safety'', ``pharmacovigilance'' ``ADRs''. The inclusion criteria were full text articles. Results: A total of 18 articles matched our inclusion criteria. In the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic drug-repurposing was used as a treatment strategy. Chinese clinical pharmacists were involved in close monitoring, documentation and reporting of ADRs. Some European countries (Italy, Belgium, Switzerland and Serbia) actively involved hospital pharmacists in the safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines. In Australia a national vaccine safety surveillance program (AusVaxSafety) was launched with the active engagement of community pharmacists. The goal of this new pharmacists-led pharmacovigilance system is to provide critically significant safety data regarding potential ADRs following vaccination.

The overall aim was that of an agile preparedness with ability to replan and reprioritize activities to fulfil pharmacovigilance obligations of a national competent authority, while continuing NoMAs tradition of transparency towards the public. Results: NoMA experienced a tenfold increase in ICSRs from healthcare professionals and consumers during COVID-19 vaccination. Compared to normal vaccine reporting the increase was even higher. Case processing, signal detection and signal management procedures were stretched thin. Still, several international signals were detected and managed early.

1512,"Introduction: Nocebo effect is the negative counterpart of the placebo phenomenon.1 It refers to the adverse effects that occur in clinical or laboratory medical contexts, respectively, after administration of an inert treatment or as part of active treatments, due to mechanisms such as expectancies of the patient.2 The nocebo responses are extremely common in medical practice and multiple factors contribute to it including risk communication statergies.3 Objective: To summarize the existing literature on nocebo responses reported in relation to COVID-19 safety, factors which might contribute to the same and its implications. Methods: Concerns on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines contributed by various sources including social and mass media, and other members in the public have contributed to the significant minority of people who were hesitant to receive the vaccine.3,4 Here lies the importance of appropriate modes and process of risk communication. Nocebo responses observed by COVID-19 vaccine recipients by virtue of expectations on the potential adverse effects might have had an impact of public's decision on receiving the vaccine. In a systematic review carried out by Amazio et al, rates of solicited adverse events in the active and placebo groups of SARSCoV-2 vaccines were compared. 5 It was reported that a substantial proportion of solicited AEs are not a result of the vaccine per se but are, in fact, nocebo effects. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the frequency and magnitude of nocebo responses in COVID-19 vaccine trials based on the data from four RCTs with a total of 119,110 participants. The frequency and magnitude of nocebo responses were 16.4% and 0.3%, respectively.6 Results: It is important to understand the factors which contribute to the nocebo responses noticed by the recipients of the COVID-19 vaccines. Methods to prevent or tackle these responses should be identified and discussed to reduce the vaccine hesitancy. For the present and future vaccination campaigns, there should be prevention strategies for nocebo effects to promote a possible greater adherence to the vaccination campaign. Raising awareness of nocebo effects by media and health care professionals and positive framing of the side effect information can help to reduce nocebo effects.5. Conclusion: The role and responsibilities of various stake holders including patients, patient organisations, health professionals, media, pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies in this regard should be identified and delineated. Risk communication strategies should be tailored to the need of the situation and focused on avoiding any negative impact.",1.0,negative,True

Objective: The Pharmacy unit created a digital form in order to collect information on the incidence of the adverse events after the anti-covid vaccination. Methods: The Pharmacy Unit created a simplified digital form including a set of questions about the occurrence of adverse events. To improve the adherence to this pharmacovigilance program, the digital form was uploaded on the hospital website and all the employees received a remainder about this vaccine adverse event reporting system via e-email regularly. The data collected from the electronic spreadsheet were analyzed by the Health Department in order to produce a report in the dedicated national website (Vigifarmaco). Results: From January 2021 to April 2022 1076 employees received the first dose, 965 received the second dose, and 1019 received the third dose. 323 adverse events reporting forms have been collected after the first dose (30% of those who received it). 291 forms (30%) were collected after the second dose. 12 forms (1.2%) were collected after the third dose. The most reported adverse events after the first dose were: local pain (38% of reported adverse events), muscle pain 15%; asthenia 12%, headache 11%.

As of March 26th, 2022, 134,361 adverse events following immunization have been collected in the National Pharmacovigilance Database, 69% of them concern women [1]. Regarding the Sardinian region, as of May 12th, 2022, there are 3043 total reports, 63.4% involve women. In July 2021, the French Drug Agency issued an alert about reports concerning menstrual alterations [2]. PRAC, since new studies have been published, recently decided to further investigate [3]. A cohort study conducted in the US comparing cycle length in a vaccinated cohort vs. an unvaccinated cohort, showed a statistically significant difference [4]. A British case-control study found that 20% of the population included reported menstrual changes, with a higher incidence in individuals with a history of Covid infection [5]. A Norwegian study showed similar results [6]. Objective: To describe the adverse events regarding menstrual disorders in the Sardinian population vaccinated against Covid-19. Methods: We analyzed reports of suspected adverse reactions in the National Pharmacovigilance Database regarding the region of Sardinia, from December 27th, 2020 to April 30th, 2022, we extracted those concerning menstrual cycle alterations after Covid-19 vaccine administration. Results: A total of 78 reports referring to all three scheduled administrations were collected. The majority concerned Comirnaty, with 56 reports: 51 were non-serious, concerning abnormal menstrual cycles in lenght and flow, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea; five cases were considered serious, but there were other adverse events associated (hypersensitivity reactions, autoimmune disorders, myocarditis in one case). Six reports were related to Vaxevria, with similar manifestations as for Comirnaty; in one case the patient was treated with Tamoxifen. Sixteen cases were reported for Spikevax, with one reporting an episode of bleeding in a three-year menopausal patient. In one case, the patient (IUD carrier) reported menstrual disturbances following all three vaccine administrations (two Comirnaty, one Spikevax). Conclusion: The different distribution of reports among the vaccines can be explained by the increased administration of Comirnaty in the general population and the phasing out of Vaxzevria.

During 2021, the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA) received a record total of more than 100.000 ICSRs on SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. At the same time, MPA implemented a record-linkage study using data from several nation-wide health registers to monitor the safety of said vaccinations [1]. Objective: To estimate the degree of under-reporting of myocarditis to the MPA ADR-database in 2021 through January 2022. Methods: We compared the number of ICSRs on suspected myocarditis submitted to the MPA with the number of cases of the same condition identified in the Swedish National Patient Register (SNPR). Dates of vaccination(s) were collected from the National Vaccination Register. A main diagnosis in SNPR within 28 days of any SARSCoV-2 vaccination was considered an exposed case.

1631,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on several sectors of the society. Whether it has disrupted drug safety monitoring is yet to be determined. Objective: To investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the proportions of spontaneous reports (SRs) of serious and unexpected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Methods: SRs received by the Coimbra Pharmacovigilance Unit (UFC) between January 2017 and December 2021 were included, except for those containing COVID-19 vaccines as suspected medicines. The SRs were categorized into two groups: pre-pandemic (2017-2019); and post-pandemic (2020-2021). The SRs were classified as serious or non-serious, and expected or unexpected, depending on the seriousness and expectedness of the suspected ADRs, according to the WHO criteria and the Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC] of each suspected medicine, respectively [1,2]. To study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the patterns of spontaneous reporting of suspected ADRs, two null hypotheses were proposed to test whether (i) the seriousness, and (ii) the expectedness were independent of the pandemic (i.e., if the pandemic has had no impact, then the proportions of SRs containing (i) serious and (ii) unexpected ADRs were expected to be the same in both periods). The qui-square test was used to test the hypotheses; p-values \ 0.001 were considered statistically significant. Microsoft Excel“ was used for the statistical analyses.",1.0,COVID-19,True
1632,"Results: A total of 1,311 and 657 SRs were received in the prepandemic and post-pandemic periods, respectively. Of the 1,311 SRs received in the three pre-pandemic years, 1,012 (77%) were serious and 657 (13%) contained unexpected ADRs; of the 657 SR received during the two post-pandemic years, 434 (66%) were serious and 133 (20%) contained unexpected ADRs. The changes from pre- to postpandemic on both proportions of SRs containing serious (an absolute decrease of 11%; p , 0.01) or unexpected ADRs (an absolute increase of 7%; p , 0.01) were not statistically significant. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has had not a significant impact on the proportions of SRs of serious or unexpected ADRs in the Central Region of Portugal. Further research should be carried out in other pharmacovigilance databases to understand if the present conclusions are applicable to other geographic regions.

1638,"Introduction: Although vaccines against COVID-19 are strongly recommended as safe and effective at alleviating the morbidity and mortality, different types of ocular complications have been reported after COVID-19 vaccination, including oculomotor nerve palsy, episcleritis, anterior uveitis, multifocal choroiditis, reactivation of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, acute macular neuroretinopathy and central serous retinopathy(1).Acute angle closure glaucoma (AACG) is an ophthalmic emergency that can be drug induced. If not promptly identified and treated, it can cause irreversible blindness. Objective: To describe an exceptional case of bilateral AACG that occurred within 4 hours following COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: This case was notified to the pharmacovigilance department in February 2022. Results: A 38-year-old woman with a history of high myopia experienced stabbing pain in her left eye 4 hours after she received the second recombinant mRNA vaccine (Pfizer)injection. Few hours later, periorbital headache appeared in left side and the eye pain became much more severe. She took paracetamol by self-medication and stayed in the darkness. The following morning, she complained of sudden loss of vision in both eyes. She consulted an ophtalmologist, where elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) was noted in her left eye (60mm of mercury). Visual acuity examination showed results of 0.5 and 0.3 for right and left eyes, respectively. Goldman visual field test revealed a nasal field defect in her left eye. The angles of both eyes were closed on optical coherence tomography. Anterior segment examination demonstrated areflexic mydriasis. The patient was diagnosed with bilateral AACG. Topical instillation of pilocarpine was provided and the IOP decreased to 45 mm Hg in left eye. Then, the patient was prescribed systemic acetazolamide, and a fixed combination of bimatoprost-timolol. On follow-up after 24 hours,",1.0,vaccine,True

Two months after onset, the visual acuity was completely restored but the areflexic mydriasis was permanent. There was no recurrence of her glaucoma during a 3-month follow-up period. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case to describe AACG following COVID-19 vaccination. The onset of ocular symptoms suggests a possible correlation between this complication and COVID-19 vaccination. However, the presence of other risk factors mainly high myopia puts this cause and effect relationship into question. References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,case,True

1658,"Introduction: With the massive widespread impact of COVID-19 [1, 2], before the accelerated development timelines for vaccines, one of the options to help mitigate disease impact was in repurposing already approved drugs [3-6]. In the race to discover/implement an already approved agent, which may also be effective in treating COVID-19, we have learned lessons to form a pharmacovigilance perspective that is central to the conscientious approach one is required to employ to ensure patient safety and continued assessment. This work was written under the umbrella of NASoP and represents learnings/recommendations for safety monitoring relating to off-label use in future pandemics or other emergency scenarios after an appropriate benefitrisk assessment, it does not represent an official view of our respective companies/institutions. Objective: Within the lens of optimizing pharmacovigilance through both the planning and the implementation phases of drug repurposing, we outline a strategy and provide suggestions to ensure optimal drug rollout and patient safety. Methods: An international, multi-institutional expert panel provides a review of lessons learned through a descriptive narrative. Results: All drug repurposing should be pursued through a systems approach insuring institutional/regional collaboration, innovation, and data-driven decision making. The roll-out of any repurposed drug should occur in two phases: the planning and implementation. Institutional responses in drug repurposing requires identification of key stakeholders, establishment of local expert working groups tasked with continuous assessment and critical review of emerging literature. The off-label use is at the discretion of the healthcare provider, in collaboration with institutional/regional authorities after an appropriate benefit-risk assessment, and we are not recommending or promoting off-label use. A shared decision making strategy is central to ensure patient involvement and understanding of not just the available evidence, but the rationale and acceptance of the repurposed drug. Pharmacovigilance plays a crucial role in the expedient evaluation of new uses for existing therapies and can rely on already established institutional monitoring modalities.

1672,"Introduction: Like many countries in the world, the first wave of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic in Morocco was marked by an overload of infected patients and unprecedented challenges. This, combined with the unknown nature of the disease, has compelled clinicians to prescribe a wide range of medicines, including experimental drugs as well as symptomatic therapies. These practices were associated with an increase in the incidence of adverse drug events (ADEs), which were reported to be higher in the COVID19 population [1]. Among front-line health workers, pharmacists were assigned various roles such as active and passive pharmacovigilance in order to ensure the safe use of drugs [2]. This was the case of our hospital, where some pharmacists participate in medical rounds to provide pharmaceutical care near patients. Objective: To demonstrate the importance of a clinical pharmacist in the reporting of ADEs in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: An observational study was conducted between September 2020 and January 2021 at a university hospital in Rabat. Only one of",1.0,COVID-19,True
1673,"five COVID-19 units had a pharmacist as a full time member of the medical team. The notification of ADEs are made on a sheet designed by the National Pharmacovigilance Center. After assessing the collected ADE's, the pharmacist compared them to all ADE's that were reported from other COVID-19 units during the study period. Data were subsequently analyzed using Excel. Results: A total of 42 ADEs in 35 patients were notified by the pharmacist (population size ,"" 120). Experimental drugs used for the viral treatment (hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin) were the most commonly recorded medications with ADEs (30%), 27% were anticoagulants and 13,5% were corticosteroids. Regarding ADEs, 26% consisted of QT interval prolongation, followed by hyperkalemia (26%), hyperglycemia (19%), bleeding (7%), and hepatic cytolysis (5%). In comparison, only 3 ADEs were notified from other COVID19 units of the hospital. Conclusion: Results of our study suggests that the presence of a pharmacist in a multidisciplinary team is crucial to enhance patient care and safety, particularly in these times of crisis. Our study has also shed light on the poor reporting rate of ADEs in the hospitalized patients, which was previously mentioned to be common in the developing world [3].

Reports of AHA have been systematically reviewed all the selected cases to check for clinical plausibility Results: In Vigibase, we identified 150 cases of suspected AHA associated with COVID-19 vaccines (146 included the PT ``acquired haemophilia''). Only three vaccine products have been reported as suspected causative agents for AHA. The disproportionality analysis showed a significant IC for the Preferred term ``Acquired haemophilia'' associated with all COVID-19 vaccines (IC: 1.3; IC025: 1.1) and with the vaccine product BNT162b2 (IC: 1.9; IC025: 1.6). After the integration with data available on VAERS and on the medical literature, and after the elimination of duplicates, 96 unique cases of AHA following COVID-19 vaccines (mostly mRNA vaccines) have been reviewed. Overall, about 22% of cases occurred in patients B 65 and no case associated with pregnancy was reported. Patients with at least one pre-existing condition that can be considered a risk factor for AHA (history of AHA, cancer, autoimmune disorder) were 20 (21%). A pre-existing condition predisposing to AHA was excluded in 57 (59%) of cases and not reported in 19 (20%) cases. The outcome was death in 10 (11%) patients and complete resolution or recovering in 39 (41%) patients with a single resolution without specific AHA treatment. Median time from last vaccine dose to diagnosis was 18 days and 40% of cases documented the occurrence after the second dose. Conclusion: Our disproportionality analysis confirmed a reporting risk for AHA associated with COVID-19 vaccines. The case review analysis identified several good-quality reports of AHA for which no alternative causes other than COVID-19 immunization can be considered. Although detection bias should be considered to explain the unexpected frequency of AHA in the population, the signal identified is robust and deserves further investigation.

1727,"Introduction: During large-scale vaccination campaign against COVID-19, the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) in collaboration with the Regional Centres of Pharmacovigilance have carried out a closely monitoring of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) about Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFIs) related to COVID19 vaccines and have assured a constant communication through public monthly reports1. During the first months of the vaccination campaign, a signal of rare events of thrombosis associated with thrombocytopenia2, particularly in young women, was detected by health authorities associated with the viral vector vaccines ChAdOx1S and Ad26.COV2-S. Objective: To present a comprehensive assessment of thrombotic and thromboembolic events associated with thrombocytopenia following COVID-19 immunisation with viral vector vaccines recorded in the Italian National Pharmacovigilance Network database Methods: We selected all ICSRs reported from 27 December 2020 to 26 December 2021 containing Preferred Terms (PT) related to platelet count reduction associated with PT related to thrombotic and thromboembolic events (clinical symptoms and/or diagnostic tests). All cases of thrombotic and thromboembolic events reporting thrombocytopenia in the narrative description of the report were also reviewed. The selected ICRSs were submitted to the independent evaluation of three pharmacovigilance experts who blindly classified into 5 levels of diagnostic certainty, according to the definition provided by the Brighton Collaboration Group (BCG)3. Disagreement were resolved by plenary discussion. Results: 12,166,236 doses of ChAdOx1-S and 1,500,746 of Ad26.COV2-S have been administered in Italy during the considered interval with overall 23,358/117,947 ICSRs related to ChAdOx1-S (19.8 %) and 1,580/117,947 related to Ad26.COV2-S (1.3 %). A total of 134 reports after vaccination with adenoviral vaccines were identified according to the inclusion criteria, of which 107 cases were defined as thrombotic thrombocytopenia (95 following ChAdOx1-S and 12 after Ad26.COV2-S). 27 reports were defined as ``not case'' (level 5, Brighton) on the basis of clinical examination or investigation, or because of the presence of heparin as a concomitant drug. Furthermore, 3 reports were excluded because of a hereditary thrombophilia or a previous history of other thrombotic episodes. Seventy-seven cases were classifiable as BCG levels 1, 2, and 3 (definite, probable and possible cases, respectively) with an overall reporting rate at about 1 case per approximately 200,000 doses administered. Women aged 30 to 49 years showed the highest reporting rates. Conclusion: In Italy, the rates of thrombotic thrombocytopenia following COVID-19 immunisation with viral vector vaccines are in line with those reported in other Countries.

Following the emergency rollout of the vaccines against COVID-19, combined with a global focus on monitoring their safety, UMC saw a sharp increase in the volume of reports of suspected side effects of the vaccines. UMC sometimes receives multiple reports corresponding to the same suspected adverse event. This can have undesirable effects when it comes to both statistical signal detection and manual review of cases. Duplicate detection of vaccines has historically been especially challenging, due to homogeneity of patients. However, the extreme quantity of COVID-19 vaccine reports has highlighted the necessity for automated duplicate detection to be performant for them.",1.0,vaccine,True
1738,"Detecting duplicate reports is a non-trivial problem. Since reports do not always contain the same level of detail, and data errors can lead to different values in corresponding fields for duplicate reports, reports cannot simply be compared field by field. Several methods have been proposed for detecting duplicates based on information provided in structured form (sex, age, date of onset etc) (1,2). In our study we additionally incorporate free text information into a duplicate detection model. Objective: To leverage the free text information in suspected adverse event reports to identify duplicate reports which are referring to the same adverse event. Methods: Our method ensembles state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Narratives are placed in a space where a smaller distance between two narratives conveys higher semantic similarity. This is done with vector embeddings using the SapBERT model, fine-tuned on a set of known duplicate reports (3). Two reports are then compared using the cosine similarity between the vector embeddings for the two narratives. This similarity is combined with representations of the structured information used in other methods in a gradient boosted decision tree model, calibrated by a logistic regression model to fine tune the probability output (4).",1.0,,True

Signal detection of vaccines, annual reports on vaccine surveillance and supporting documents for pharmacovigilance activity are the main core of the group activities (2). During pandemic, enhanced surveillance was conducted to better characterize safety profile of the new antiCOVID-19 vaccines. Objective: We reported the enhanced surveillance for anti-COVID19 vaccines, managed by the AIFA in collaboration with ISS, MH, PVRC and RP. Methods: Actions implemented for the enhanced surveillance: daily control of the RNF and follow-up requests, periodic publication of reports, interactive graphs on web site updated monthly, meetings of signal detection for anti-COVID-19 vaccines on a monthly basis. Results: From the first month of the vaccination campaign (27/12/ 2020-26/01/2021) a report on the course of safety surveillance was made publicly available (3). Until 26/09/2022 the report was published on a monthly basis, then, considering the downward trend in report submission and the greater knowledge of the vaccine safety profile, we moved to a quarterly frequency.

1780,"Introduction: After the primary infection, the reactivation of both Herpes Simplex viruses (HSV) and Varicella Zoster virus (VZV) is mainly triggered by a secondary immunodeficiency state, either agerelated or iatrogenic, or due to concomitant diseases (e.g., HIV, cancer), especially in the elderly population [1-3]. Indeed, Herpes reactivation has not been commonly associated with immunization and only few cases are described in literature [4]. To date, HSV/VZV reactivation is listed in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) of only one COVID-19 mRNA vaccine [5]. However, even if limited, evidence on a potential correlation between vaccines expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and Herpes reactivation is increasing [6]. In Italy, elderly patients represent a population of particular interest for this specific adverse event (AE) since they are currently involved in the 4th booster campaign (which may not be the last one).

All reports were classified by age group, by system organ class and Preferred Term according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Terminology and degree of seriousness. We identified the educational sessions held where: possible adverse events were described, channels of support and reporting were shared and, monitored the trend in reporting of AEFIs over the period of roll out of the first dose of vaccine. Results: From the 11,773 vaccinations administered to healthcare workers during the period,328 AEFI reports were received all but 1 were categorized as non-serious AEFI events. The trend in AEFI events reported reduced markedly from 236 reported in first 2 weeks of campaign to 5 reports after 8 weeks of campaign. The weekly education sessions on COVID vaccines and vaccine vigilance reported attendance of 800 healthcare workers on average. The uptake of vaccines was reported to be high among healthcare workers as misinformation and concerns with regards to AEFIs was addressed. Conclusion: Institutional initiatives for vaccine pharmaco-vigilance coupled with educational sessions, in a season where vaccine hesitancy was high, enable risk management for early COVID vaccine rollout in Kenya.

We extracted the data using VigiLyze“ software with the English version 25 of MedDRA to identify features of COVID-19 vaccine-associated GBS. In addition, we evaluated vaccine causality using the updated French causality assessment method [2]. Results: Overall, we retrieved 8 patients with GBS post COVID-19 vaccination: Men were representing 62.5% (5/3) of cases. The median age of affected patients was 59 (range: 41; 80) years. The most frequently reported vaccine type was followed in order by Comirnaty“ Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (n ,"" 3 reports [37.5%]), Vaxzevria“ AstraZeneca vaccine (n "", 3 [37.5%]) and Janssen“ vaccine (n ,"" 2 [25%]). The mean time interval from vaccination to symptom onset was 15.3 days (range 7-30 days). Four patients developed GBS after receiving the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, three after the second dose and one after the third dose. Clinical manifestations were different with varying severity: classical GBS [1] (progressive ascending limb weakness associated with reduced or absent reflexes) in 5 cases, and GBS with unilateral facial palsy in 3. In all cases, electromyography (EMG) studies were consistent with the demyelinating pathology of GBS. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed albuminocytologic dissociation in 3 cases, was normal in 3 and not done in 2. Five patients were treated with a course of intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) for five days and one patient received a total of 2 sessions of plasma exchange. In 2 patients the nature of the treatment was unknown. Six patients reported clinical improvement within 7-10 days while two showed treatment-related fluctuations (TRF). Conclusion: Our observations suggest that COVID-19 vaccines may be associated with GBS. Continuous surveillance and further studies are warranted to assess the significance of the association.

Study period started on the date of availability of vaccines in each country until 24 December 2021 (VAERS) and 31 August 2021 (Canada Vigilance), last available updates. A rapid review was conducted to identify major communications on COVID-19 vaccine safety. The dates and contents of communications were compared to time trends in reporting rates, without making causal inferences. Results: In the US, the risk of thrombosis associated with viral vector vaccines was covered by 5 major communications [13 April 2021, 2 warnings, 20 April 2021, 30 April 2021, 16 December 2021], which was followed by an increase in reporting rate of thrombotic events of 529.6% within 1 week after the first communication. There were 2 communications on thrombosis in Canada (16 March 2021, 13 May 2021) as well as 1 warning on capillary leak syndrome (29 June 2021). In Canada Vigilance, an increase in reporting rate of 452.5% was found almost 3 weeks prior to the publication of the first communication, which coincides with the date of release of the communication in the US. There was 1 major communication on the risk of pericarditis and myocarditis associated with mRNA vaccines in the US (24 June 2021) where an increase in reporting rate of 33.6% was observed less than 1 week before the warning. There were 2 communications in Canada (both on 30 June 2021) where the reporting rate of pericarditis and myocarditis for mRNA vaccines increased by 47.8% within 1 week following the communications. Changes in reporting rates were not observed for AEFIs not covered in communications. Observed trends were the same for reports submitted by health care providers and consumers. Conclusion: The dramatic increase in reporting rate immediately after, or sometimes just before, the release of communications was likely due notoriety bias. There was no spillover effect to other AEFIs. References/Further Sources of Information Not applicable.",1.0,vaccine,True

Despite of this properties presents several immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory characteristics [1,2]. In 2020, with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers used existing drugs with potential for the treatment of COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine, which ended up being used off-label [3,4]. From the clinical trials hydroxychloroquine has many adverse effects that can increase risk for the SARS-COV-2 patients health. Common adverse effects are related to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems, neurotoxicity and retinopathy [2,5]. Objective: The objective of this research was to describe the adverse effects profile of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients and to characterize the risks associated with off-label use of hydroxychloroquine.",1.0,COVID-19,True
1836,"Methods: An observational, retrospective and descriptive study was conducted. Information collected from the ``Eudravigilance'' database was analyzed using descriptive statistics with R Studio“ software. Information about the source of reporting, patient sex, serious adverse reactions, deaths and off-label cases and their outcome, were evaluated and compared in the pre- and post-pandemic period. Results: The number of reports of adverse reactions to hydroxychloroquine increased significantly during the pandemic period (increase of 310.3%), with health professionals (92.0%) and woman (2020: 64%; 2021: 81%) reporting the most. The analysis of age groups allowed us to conclude that the 18-64 age group has the highest number of reported patients (2020: 49%; 2021: 53%). The offlabel use of hydroxychloroquine was also an important aspect to consider in this study: in the period of 2020-2021, a total of 29.8% of suspected ADR have been caused by hydroxychloroquine in off-label use, with an important percentage of those being associated with COVID utilization (20.0%). Finally, deaths associated with the use of hydroxychloroquine were also evaluated, of which 67.0% are described in off-label use. Conclusion: The number of reports of adverse reactions to hydroxychloroquine increased significantly during the pandemic. The potential for harm increased as off-label administration of hydroxychloroquine was associated with an increased incidence and severity of adverse reactions. However, associated with other drugs, this drug may potentiate certain adverse reactions, such as QT interval prolongation, nausea, dizziness, hypoglycaemia, heart failure, among others. Regarding outcomes, there seems to be an increase in the number of deaths associated with hydroxychloroquine, however causality has not been established for the observed data. Hydroxychloroquine presented varied adverse reactions in the observed data, and its off-label use during the pandemic showed an increase in its incidence.

Objective: To assess reports of GBS reported in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following COVID-19 vaccination and to evaluate if a COVID-19 vaccine has a lower/higher probability of reporting Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) with GBS in a direct comparison with all other COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: After selecting all ICRSs of GBS following vaccination reported in VAERS from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021, we assessed them through the case definition and classification of the Brighton Collaboration (BC). We performed a descriptive analysis. Finally, we used the Reporting Odds Ratio with a 95% of Confidence Interval to investigate disproportional reporting of GBS among the vaccines included in the analysis. Results: 774 ICSRs of GBS have been reported in VAERS, and 279 of them met the BC Case Definition: 30 (10.7%) have been evaluated as Definitive, 56 (20.0%) as Probable, and 193 (69.3%) as Possible. COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech was the most commonly vaccine reported (N , 118; 42.3%) followed by COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna (N , 82; 29.4%) and COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (N , 79; 28.3%). GBS was more commonly reported for male subjects (N , 143; 51.3%) aged between 12 and 20 years (N ,"" 59; 21.1%). GBS mainly occurred between the 1st and 12th day following the first dose administration of mRNA vaccines and between the 4th and the 15th day following COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen.

1867,"Introduction: COVID-19 is a complex disease with several clinical phases of progression, affecting many organs apart from the respiratory tract that has shown a worst prognosis in both patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus [1]. Based on these considerations, the vaccination for COVID-19 is a priority for this subpopulation [2]. However, few data have been published on the effects of impaired glucose metabolism induced by COVID-19 vaccines. Objective: We decided to perform a study to describe Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) of impaired glucose metabolism events reported in the European database (Eudravigilance, EV). Methods: ICSRs were retrieved for the period from January 1st, 2021 to December 11th, 2021. An ICSR related to events of impaired glucose metabolism was identified by using selected preferred terms (PTs) from Standardized MedDRA Queries ``Hyperglycaemia/new onset diabetes mellitus'' and ``Hypoglycaemia''. Impaired glucose metabolism events were described and analyzed based on the Diabetologists' classification into nine groups: ``diabetes in pregnancy'', ``acute complications of diabetes'', ``pre-diabetes'', ``type 1 diabetes mellitus'', ``type 2 diabetes mellitus'', ``high glucose levels'', ``diabetes mellitus inadequate control'', ``diabetes melli-tus not specified'', and ``hypoglycaemia''. The reporting odds ratios were computed to assess the reporting frequency for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines compared to COVID-19 viral vector-based vaccines. Results: During the study period, 3,917 ICSRs with a COVID-19 vaccine as suspected and at least an event of impaired glucose metabolism were retrieved from the EV, of which 2,027 (51.75%) referred to Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 586 (14.96%) to Moderna vaccine, 1,163 (29.70%) to Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and 141 (3.59%) to Janssen vaccine. From 3,917 ICSRs, we observed 4,275 impaired glucose metabolism events (1.09 adverse events per ICSR). Most adverse events were classified as serious (2,694; 63.02%), and the most reported events were related to ``high glucose levels'' (2,012; 47.06%). The mRNA vaccines were associated with an increased reporting frequency of ``type 1 diabetes mellitus'' (ROR 1.86; 95% CI 1.33-2.60), ``type 2 diabetes mellitus'' (ROR 1.58; 95% CI 1.03-2.42), ``high glucose levels'' (ROR 1.16; 95% CI 1.06-1.27), ``diabetes mellitus inadequate control'' (ROR 1.63; 95% CI 1.25-2.11), and ``hypoglycemia'' (ROR 1.62; 95% CI 1.41-1.86) compared to viral vector-based vaccines. The highest reporting rate per 100,000 was observed for Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (1.87; 95% CI 1.77-1.97). Conclusion: In conclusion, mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were associated with an increased reporting frequency of alterations of glucose homeostasis compared to viral-vector COVID-19 vaccines. Clinicians should be aware of these events to better manage glycaemic perturbations. Larger nationwide studies are warranted to verify these findings.

Analysis of pharmacovigilance database allows to extrapolate important information to identify possible safety signals. Objective: Our pharmacovigilance study aims to describe and evaluate the onset of adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in the pediatric population. Methods: We retrieved all pediatric Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) collected in the European pharmacovigilance database, Eudravigilance from the 01/01/2021 to 4/03/2022 related to Spikevax and Comirnaty. We carried out a disproportionality analysis (Reporting Odds Ratio-95% CI) to compare the reporting probability of some AEFIs of interest (seizure, pericarditis, myocarditis, multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS), menstrual disorders, failure and anaphylactic shock) between Comirnaty and Spikevax. Results: We retrieved in Eudravigilance 25.019 ICSR related to Comirnaty describing a total of 75.040 AEFIs and 1.862 ICSRs referred to Spikevax reporting overall 5.361 AEFIs occurred in pediatric population. Majority of ICSRs reported well-known general disorders (headache, pyrexia, fatigue and nausea) for both mRNA vaccines. ICSRs were more frequently referred the adolescent patients (Comirnaty, 86.2%; Spikevax, 86.4%). We found a slight prevalence of female gender for both mRNA vaccine (Spikevax, 52.6 %; Comirnaty 53.9%). Reproductive system disorders were more frequently referred to females. In particular, these events included menstrual disorders (N ,"" 609, Comirnaty; N "","" 23, Spikevax), amenorrhoea (N "","" 408, Comirnaty; N "","" 16, Spikevax) or intermenstrual bleeding (N "","" 169, Comirnaty; N "","" 10, Spikevax), polymenorrhoea (N "","" 172, Comirnaty; N "","" 10, Spikevax).

From disproportionality analysis emerged a statistically significant ROR for menstrual disorders (ROR 1.72, 95% CI 1.43-2.10; p \ 0.05), failure (ROR 8.11, 95% CI 5.05-13.97; p \ 0.05) and seizure (ROR 1.54, 95% CI 1.03-2.41; p "","" 0.037) when compared Comirnaty versus Spikevax. Conclusion: Majority of pediatric AEFIs are mild and with a positive outcome, supporting the role of ongoing COVID-19 vaccination campaign in this population as a critical public health tool for disease prevention and control of pandemic. Further investigations are needed in this population. References/Further Sources of Information Kamidani S, Rostad CA, Anderson EJ. COVID-19 vaccine development: a pediatric perspective.

1880,"Introduction: Patient reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) could supplement the existing reporting system of the Moroccan Pharmacovigilance Poison Control Center (CAPM) and contribute to the early detection of ADRs, which are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Objective: This study is considered the first study in the region it was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitude, notification, and practice of pharmacovigilance among patients during the COVID-19 period, through pharmacists of the DRAA-TAFILALET region in Morocco. In order to model the impact of Good Pharmacovigilance Practices over the COVID-19 period on pharmacist's reactivity to pharmacovigilance. Methods: It was a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study devoted to 120 pharmacists in the DRAA-TAFILALET region. Using latent variable structural modeling by the partial least squares (PLS) method via the XLSTAT software (version 2017). Results: A total of 120 pharmacists completed and returned the questionnaire. The reliability of the measurement was [ 0.7, which allows us to test the internal and external validity of our conceptual model. Nine hypotheses were validated, against two invalid derivative hypotheses. The results obtained allow us to propose areas for improvement and action plans to be taken into account by the Moroccan strategy of pharmacovigilance. Conclusion: Spontaneous ADRs reporting is the cornerstone of any pharmacovigilance system to maintain patient safety. Indeed, it is necessary first to initiate all healthcare professionals to report through training and secondly to inform the general public of the availability of a national pharmacovigilance center where they can report an ADR, in order to keep the culture of ADR reporting perennial.

1888,"Introduction: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome is a multisystem condition with chronic, bilateral, non-necrotizing, granulomatous panuveitis and exudative retinal detachment (1). It is a very rare adverse event of vaccination, and cases of VKH disease following Covid-19 vaccine have rarely been reported so far [1-3]. Objective: Herein, we report a case of VKH disease following mRNA-1273 (SpikeVax“) COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: This case was notified in November 2021 to the National Centre of Pharmacovigilance and evaluated according to the updated French method of causality assessment. Results: A 33-year-old female patient with a medical history of renal failure and without any history of ophthalmic disease, received her second dose of SpikeVax“ on August 20, 2021. Four days later, she experienced headache and fatigue and subsequently developed bilateral blurred vision seven days following the vaccination. The evolution was marked by the persistence of symptoms and a decreased bilateral visual acuity a week later. Ophthalmologic examination showed an aqueous flare, keratic precipitates, iris nodules and cells in the anterior vitreous in both eyes work up ruled out systemic infection or autoimmune disease. ANCA were negative. ACE levels were normal. Serology test for HBV, HIV, syphilis and mycobacterium tuberculosis were also negative. A VKH syndrome was diagnosed. One month after treatment with oral prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil, the evolution was favorable without any sequels. Conclusion: Although there is a chronological relation between the onset of VKH and the SpikeVax“, the role of vaccination couldn't be certainly assessed.

1918,"Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected healthcare systems, as well as everyday life worldwide [1,2]. Pharmacovigilance has definitely had a central role in this context of emergency, for both new and old molecules being investigated as potential treatments for COVID-19, but above all for the monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines [3]. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate how COVID-19 pandemic has changed the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reporting at the University Hospital of Catania. Methods: We performed a descriptive analysis of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) collected in the Italian National Pharmacovigilance Network by the University Hospital of Catania from January 2019 to December 2021. Data were compared in terms of number of reports per year, patient characteristics, treatments, severity of reactions, and type of reporter. Results: Overall, the number of ICSRs collected was 1,664, 463 in 2019, 590 in 2020 and 611 in 2021 (Figure 1). In the majority of cases, ADRs have involved female subjects in the 18-65 years age group (mean age 49 years). Most cases were classified as not serious (81%); nevertheless, reports of serious ADRs progressively raised from 13.2% in 2019 to 16.6% in 2020 and 25% in 2021. In 2019 and 2020 almost all ICSRs were spontaneously sent by physicians, while in 2021 a greater reporting by citizens (13.9%), pharmacists (11.1%) and other health care professionals (3.8%) has been observed. Adalimumab represented the most frequently reported suspected drug in 2019 and 2020, with the highest number of ICSRs concerning lack of therapeutic response (77% and 92.5%, respectively). In 2021 the number of ADRs caused by vaccines has dramatically risen, from zero in 2019-2020 to 251 in 2021, as a consequence of COVID-19 vaccination campaign (tozinameran 32.6%).

Objective: The aim of this study is to analyse and characterise ADRs associated with anti-infective agents reported to the NPC within the SFDA between the years 2018 and 2020. Methods: A retrospective review was carried out of all ADRs involved with anti-infective agents submitted to the NPC between 2018 and 2020. A descriptive analysis was undertaken to determine the number of ADRs, and then to characterise them according to their Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification, age and gender of patients involved, as well as seriousness and type of anti-infective class(es) involved. The SFDA's Ethics Committee has exempted this study from formal ethical approval. Results: A total of 12,567 ADRs were included, of which 53.78% occurred in males. Among all age groups, adults between the age of 45 and 64 were the ones most reported (10.89%). The most reported ADRs were classified according to the MedDRA in terms of investigations (26.76%), gastrointestinal disorders (22.76%), as well as skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (14.88%). The level of seriousness was not specified in 91.47% of the reports. Almost two percent of ADRs were reported to require intervention to prevent permanent damage followed by ADRs that resulted in prolonged hospitalisation (1%). Antibacterials were commonly reported (83.5%), followed by antiviral (10.9%), and antifungal medications (3.8%). Conclusion: This is the first study to characterise ADRs associated with anti-infective agents.

Objective: A post-marketing evaluation of the safety of onasemnogene abeparvovec and nusinersen through the analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database with a focus on the pediatric population (0-17 years). Methods: Data on Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) reported in children (0-17 years) were retrieved from the FAERS database for the period January 2017-December 2021. A descriptive analysis was performed, and characteristics of all ICSRs, including the reported drugs and events, were described and stratified by drugs and age groups. Moreover, cases with fatal outcomes were investigated as a sub-analysis. All data manipulation and statistical analysis were performed using R Statistical Software. Results: We included 2,263 pediatric ICSRs (48.0% females and 68.1% from United States). The median age was 3.0 years. 59.8% was submitted through expedited (15-days) (65%) or periodic reporting (39.4%) and 0.8% by non-manufacturers. A total of 63.2% of all ICSRs were serious and 10.2% had a fatal outcome. The most frequent reported System Organ Classes (SOCs) were ``Infections and Infestations'' (N ,"" 572), ``General disorders'' (N "","" 542), and ``Investigations'' (N "", 511). The most commonly Preferred Terms (PT) were pyrexia (N ,"" 214), vomiting (N "","" 169), and headache (N "","" 132).

1956,"Introduction: Olanzapine is atypical antipsychotic. The drug's mechanism of action is not fully understood. It mainly mediates its antipsychotic action via dopamine and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism [1]. Congestive Cardiomyopathy (a.k.a. Dilated Cardiomyopathy) is a type of cardiomyopathy characterized by structural modifications of myocardium. Due to these modifications, abnormal stretching and dilation of heart chambers results in reduced pumping activity of heart muscle. Patients with Congestive Cardiomyopathy may remain symptom-free for unspecified period of time and then experience sharp deterioration in cardiac functions suddenly [2]. Objective: The aim of this review is to evaluate the risk of Congestive Cardiomyopathy associated with the use of Olanzapine and to suggest regulatory recommendations if required. Methods: Signal Detection team at SFDA performed a signal review using National Pharmacovigilance Center (NPC) database, and World Health Organization (WHO) database, VigiBase, with literature screening to retrieve all related information to assess the causality between congestive cardiomyopathy and olanzapine use. The search conducted on August 26th, 2021. Results: Case Review: Signal detection team at SFDA have searched Saudi national database and WHO database to find individual case safety reports (ICSRs) of congestive cardiomyopathy associated with olanzapine. While the search resulted in zero reported local cases, the search in the WHO database resulted in 20 global case-reports. The authors used signal detection tool (Vigilyze) to retrieve all reported cases [3]. Authors also applied WHO-UMC causality assessment criteria on ICSRs with completeness score (0.5) and above (n ,"" 9). Among them, 6 cases of congestive cardiomyopathy were possibly linked to olanzapine. Literature: A scientific literature search was performed for olanzapine and risk of congestive cardiomyopathy. We found a case of 28-year-old male patient with bipolar disorder suffered congestive cardiomyopathy after taking olanzapine for 10 years was published in 2016 [4]. Datamining: The disproportionality of the observed and the expected reporting rate for drug/adverse drug reaction pair is estimated using information component (IC), a tool developed by WHO-UMC to measure the reporting ratio. Positive IC reflects higher statistical association while negative values indicates less statistical association, considering the null value equal to zero. The results of (IC "","" 1.4) revealed a positive statistical association for the drug/ADR combination. Conclusion: The weighted cumulative evidence identified from local and global cases is sufficient to suggest causal association between olanzapine and congestive cardiomyopathy. Despite the need for a more thorough review of safety data to confirm the risk, health care professionals should be aware of the potential risk in drug recipients.

1967,"Introduction: Isotretinoin is a form of vitamin A used to treat acne. It is the only therapy that has an impact on all of the major etiological factors implicated in acne [1]. Adults with growth hormone deficiency (which may result from problems with the pituitary gland or hypothalamus) may have symptoms including: poor bone density and osteoporosis, reduced muscle mass, fatigue, depression, and poor memory [2]. Objective: To assess the risk of blood growth hormone decrease associated with isotretinoin and, if necessary, make regulatory recommendations Methods: The Signal Detection team at SFDA performed a signal review using the National Pharmacovigilance Center (NPC) database and the WHO database, VigiBase, with literature screening to retrieve all related information to assess the causality between blood growth hormone decrease and isotretinoin use. The search was conducted on November 11th, 2021. The disproportionality of the observed and the expected reporting rates for drug/adverse drug reaction pair was estimated using an information component (IC), a tool developed by WHO-UMC to measure the reporting ratio. Positive IC reflects higher statistical association, while negative values indicate less statistical association. Results: Case Review: A search in the NPC database and WHO database (Vigibase) was conducted to retrieve all reported cases. There were five global ICSRs found, but no local ICSRs. The Signal Detection team applied the WHO-UMC causality assessment tool to all cases. 1 case was found supportive of the association, and 4 cases lacked the necessary information to assess causality. Datamining: The results of (IC ,"" 2.7) revealed a positive statistical association for the drug/ADR combination. Literature: In 2015, a pre-and post-exposure study was published. The effects of various isotretinoin dosing regimens on pituitary hormones in drug recipients were studied. Blood samples were taken before the start of treatment and three months later. Growth hormone levels were found to be significantly lower (p "","" 0.002) [3]. Conclusion: The weighted cumulative evidence identified from global cases, literature and datamining is sufficient to suggest a causal association between isotretinoin and a decrease in blood growth hormone. Despite the need for a more thorough review of safety data to confirm the risk, health care professionals should be aware of the potential risk in drug recipients and monitor signs of blood growth hormone decrease.

Olfactory hallucination is a condition in which a person perceives odors that aren't present. Some might notice the odor in just one nostril, while others have it in both [2]. Objective: The purpose of this review is to assess the risk of olfactory hallucinations from the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine and, if necessary, make regulatory recommendations. Methods: The Signal Detection (SD) team at SFDA performed a signal review using the National Pharmacovigilance Center (NPC) database and World WHO database, VigiBase, with literature screening to retrieve all related information to assess the causality between olfactory hallucinations and Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine use.

1986,"Introduction: In 2011, the US Food and Drug administration informed on the dose dependent QTc-prolonging effect of citalopram1. In Germany, direct healthcare professional communication letters (DHPC) were sent out to inform on the cardiac risk associated with citalopram and escitalopram administration. As regulatory measures the maximum daily dose of citalopram and escitalopram was restricted, in the summary of product characteristics QTc-prolonging co-medication was stated as contraindicated2,3. Objective: To analyze the effect of the DHPC in inpatients with the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder by using data from the project ``Arzneimittelsicherheit in der Psychiatrie e.V.'' (AMSP). Methods: AMSP is a multicenter pharmacovigilance project in which adverse drug reactions of psychotropic drugs are documented. Data on drug utilization is recorded in participating psychiatric hospitals on two days per year (reference dates)4. Data from 2004-2010 (preDHPC) and 2013-2017 (post-DHPC) were used to examine whether both (1) the proportion of patients treated with a higher than the newly recommended maximum daily dose of citalopram or escitalopram and (2) the proportion of patients with QTc-prolonging co-medication (according to the German SPC) declined post-DHPC. Adult inpatients with anxiety disorders treated with citalopram or escitalopram were included in this analysis. Dose levels and co-medication were screened.

1987,"Results: From 1993 to 2017, data of 67.000 patients in total were recorded on reference dates. In this analysis, 364 patients with anxiety disorders treated with citalopram or escitalopram were identified preDHPC, 262 post-DHPC. Demographic data pre- and post-DHPC did not differ. The proportion of patients exceeding the recommended daily dose decreased from 10.7 to 5.4 % (p ,"" 0.019). The proportion of patients with QTc-prolonging co-medication remained unchanged (54.7 vs. 51.5 %, p "","" 0.437). Conclusion: As in previous studies on different patient populations, the proportion of patients with anxiety disorders exceeding the newly recommended maximum daily dose declined significantly while the proportion of patients with QTc-prolonging co-medication remained unchanged. Precise instructions such as recommendations regarding the reduced maximum daily dose are obviously easier to implement than the introduction of a contraindication with regard to the simultaneous administration of any, but not specified, QTc-prolonging drug. In conclusion, information on drug risks should be precise and formulated clearly. As far as possible, advice for specific clinical situations should be given. This could facilitate the appropriate implementation of regulatory guidance on drug use in clinical practice.

1999,"The recommended therapeutic DXM dosage is 15-30 mg every 4 hours. The four dose-dependent levels of abuse are described: feelings of stimulation (100-200 mg), hallucinations, euphoria (200-400 mg), impaired motoric functions (400-600 mg) and strong dissociative effects (over 600 mg). (1,2) Objective: To describe the national regulatory action in 2017 based on reported cases of DXM misuse and its update. Methods: Due to active pharmacovigilance and intensive co-operation in field, a total of 113 serious reports of misuse were captured within few months (May-July 2017). Reports identified two risk groups-adolescents and young adults (mainly 12-24 years) and psychiatric patients. To decrease the risk of DXM abuse, urgent action was required. After thorough assessment, switch of solid forms of monocomponent DXM products from OTC to Rx mode (prescription only) was considered the most appropriate regulatory action. DXM monocomponent syrups and polycomponent tablets and syrups for cough treatment remained OTC available with request for periodic safety reports from MAHs (6monthly, annually, with 3-years period). Following Rx switch in August 2017, intensive communication was initiated including: DHPC (3), web announcement (4), ADR bulletin (5), scientific publication (6), participation at local psychiatrists' conferences. Results: Update in 2022: Rx switch led to withdrawal of both solid monocomponent DXM products authorised in CZ. Moreover, 2 polycomponent syrups were withdrawn, out of 12 DXM products authorised in 2017. The analysis of reports in Q2 2017-Q1 2022 (n , 47) showed listed ADRs in therapeutic doses of DXM (n ,"" 11), unintended exposure to children (n "","" 4), historical literature cases (n "", 6) and cases of misuse reported retrospectively from TIS (n , 26). Few comments from DXM abusers of syrup followed by gastrointestinal ADRs with no or little psychogenic effect were identified in non-scientific discussions (2). The public exposure to DXM has been successfully limited and no new reports of misuse were identified in SUKL database. Conclusion: This topic shows the importance of spontaneous reporting to the authority which enables strict regulatory action and thus provided useful feedback to HCP to enhance the reporting of ADRs. Rx switch led to desired effect on significant decrease in DXM misuse. References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,case,True

2027,"Introduction: In the Sardinia region, over the years, several awareness-raising programs have been launched to promote reports of adverse reactions (ADRs). Despite this, there are low numbers of spontaneous reports of adverse reactions annually [1-3]. Objective: A survey was developed and administered to all health professionals (e.g. doctors, pharmacists, nurses and socio-health workers) with the aim of evaluating their knowledge on pharmacovigilance and identifying targeted intervention actions to compensate for any lack of information and lead to an implementation of the number and quality of reports. Methods: The survey, consisting of 11 questions, was sent electronically to healthcare professionals in Sardinia. The answers were recorded from 02/25/2022 to 05/10/2022. In the first part, general information on the profession and workplace was collected, in the second part questions on pharmacovigilance were asked. Results: 113 people responded to the survey, 51% doctors, 25% pharmacists, 13% nurses and 11% other health workers. 77% of the participants said they observed at least 1 adverse reaction, but of these 40% said they never reported ADRs. The main reasons for not reporting include: the adverse reaction was already known, i.e. present in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) (34%), the adverse reaction was not serious (29%), it was not sure that the adverse reaction was caused by the medicine, the reporting methods take too long (12%). The 57% of the participants said they were unaware of the existence of drugs subjected to additional monitoring and the 30% after seeing the additional monitoring symbol and its explanation said they did not understand its meaning. Conclusion: In order to promote pharmacovigilance activity, a poster will be distributed to clarify to healthcare professionals that they must report all adverse reactions of which they become aware, both those already known and present in the SmPC and those that are not serious. It will be clarified that each report sent constitutes suspicion of an adverse reaction and that only thanks to the large collection of specific reports for a particular drug is it possible to trace the causal link between the drug administered and the observed ADR. Therefore, they are all encouraged to report to increase data flow. The significance and importance of additional drug monitoring will also be explained.

2040,"Introduction: Cross-reactivity (CR) has been reported among anticonvulsant drugs, known to cause cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADR). However, inconsistent results among studies evaluating patch-testing usefulness for cross-reactivity are frequently reported. Objective: To investigate the risk of cross-reactions documented through patch test (PT) among antiepileptic drugs (AED) based on a review of the literature. Methods: Research was carried out to find data on PT performance in patients who had presented cADR after AED exposition. Articles matching keyword search ``cross-reactivity'' AND ``antiepileptics'' and ``Patch-Test'' AND ``antiepileptics'' were retrieved. From 609 references matching keyword search, 84 articles were included for preliminary analysis; of these, 31 were excluded for absence of individual data for a total of 51 articles (n , 340 patients): 37 publications included only PT results for the initial suspect (IS) of cADR and 14 publications included patch testing for the IS and other AED. Results: Carbamazepine (CBZ) was the IS in 88% (n ,"" 301) of patients. For publications that tested only patients for the IS, 52% of the PT were positive; for publications testing other drugs than the IS, the patch tests were 50% positive (n "","" 63) for the IS. Data on cross reactivity explored by patch tests included 113 patients; among them, CBZ PT, which was the IS, was positive for 57% of them.

2047,"Introduction: Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) is an acute toxidermia characterized by abrupt destruction of the superficial skin layer and mucous membranes [1]. With the exception of some idiopathic cases, Stevens-Johnson syndrome is usually triggered by drugs or associated with infections [2]. In this report, we present a first case notified at the University Hospital of Libreville as a serious adverse reaction during a prospective study on the monitoring of serious adverse reactions at the University Hospital of Libreville. This is the first study of its kind on Pharmacovigilance in Gabon. It reports the case of a patient who developed SJS after taking lidocaine hydrochloride. Objective: To study the occurrence of SJS as an adverse event and to identify the cost of its treatment/management. Methods: The patient is a 28-year-old man who was hospitalized after the development of cheilitis and non-pruritic erythematous papules on the plantar surface of the feet and on the palm of the hands compatible with SJS. His case was monitored for a period of 8 days at the Dermatology Department of the University Hospital of Libreville, Gabon. Medication management consisted of dexchlorpheniramine pantoprazole tramadol, demiconazole, fusidic acid and lidocaine. Results: Complete blood count (CBC), red blood cells (RBC) , 8130/mm3 (Norm ,"" 4500 to 11,000 per microliter and therefore normal); Hemoglobin (HB) in men "", 17.1 g/dl (Standard , 14 to 17 g) and therefore normal; Platelet ,"" 108,000/mm3 (Norm "","" 140,000 to 250,000 ll explaining the bleeding disorder without anemia or leukopenia; CRP "","" 100 mg (norm, lower than 6) and therefore an inflammation instead of an infection and that it is an SJS. We note that the reaction was acute and severe, with the appearance of the first signs of pain and redness a few hours after taking the Lidocaine. The global direct medical cost during his hospitalization was 341,22 Euro. Conclusion: Stevens-Johnson syndrome may also be a Type B adverse effect caused by lidocaine.

2066,"Introduction: Our hospital operated a population vaccination centre (CVP) in Verona between March and August 2021, administering an average of 2000-2500 anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations per day. Risk communication offers a methodology for assessing the risk perception of vaccines; managing high volumes of activity may need to consider the ways and processes of communicating the risk of adverse events [1-2]. Objective: What to improve for better risk communication in CVP during a mass-vaccination campaign; compare the differences between reports detected by hospital, regional, and national pharmacovigilance. Methods: A fact sheet was produced based on the guidance of the ministry of health and the drug agency. It was possible to look up information regarding vaccine adverse events during online booking. Multiple videowall were installed before the medical check. Healthcare workers were trained on adverse event risk communication and reporting methods: an online dataset was collected and share online to physicians involved in the vaccination campaign. Moreover through a surveillance conducted between March and August 2021, we asked users about their level of satisfaction with the information they received regarding to clarity, completeness of information received, and informed consent form. We collected adverse event reports from the Verona hospital through 2021; we collected data from regional reports and from AIFA reports. We compared the hospital data with regional and national data. Results: Survey collected 3871 answers; about information area 71.10% were ``extremely satisfied''. Who were dissatisfied request for more information materials at each stage of vaccination: before (information about vaccines), during (information about procedures and side effects) and after the vaccination session (more complete information on how to report adverse events). Staff area (medical and nurse) collected 88.40% ``extremely satisfied''. AOVR collected 392 reports of adverse events (356 [99.82%] non serious and 36 [9.18%] serious); Veneto collected 15.982 (14.513 [90.82%] non serious and 1.468 [9.18%] serious); National data were 97.846 (83.967 [85.93%] non serious and 13.741 [14.06%] serious) [3-5]. Conclusion: The management of risk communication during the operation of a population centre (CVP) was perceived with satisfaction by the users. The values of adverse event reports received by AOVR's pharmacovigilance system are comparable with regional data and serious events are lower than national data.

Since March 2021, it has intensified the implementation of risk communication strategies like the publication of alerts and notices, the promotion of online events open to the general public. Objective: Check whether the greater interest in pharmacovigilance topics on the internet and Anvisa's risk communication had an impact on the increase in ICSRs. Methods: This study where were compared the interest on the internet for searching the terms like ``VigiMed'', ``report of adverse event'', ``how to report'' and ``adverse reaction'' (terms in Portuguese) and the impact on the number ICSRs forwarded to the Agency, collected through Google Trends (terms), VigiMed (notifications) and Anvisa's website (risk communication actions). The study period was from 1st March to 15 June 2021. It was considered as an impact the increase of ICSRs above the average after up to 72 hours of the risk communication actions or interest in the terms related above. Results: After the 19 risk communication actions in the period evaluated, there were an increase in ICSRs in 15 (79%). In 13 actions, categorized as alerts and communications, an increase in reports from health professionals and pharmaceutical companies was identified. In the other two actions, consumers were the main reporters and seem to have been impacted by online open events and in interviews with mass media--the two actions that had the greatest impact.

The term ``how to report'' was the most interesting in the period evaluated, with 25 peaks, which coincided with 18 risk communication actions and with 11 peaks of increased ICSRs. Conclusion: Despite being a preliminary study and with the possibility of bias from other actions such as the dissemination of objects related by the media, there is a coincidence between the interest of internet users in topics related to pharmacovigilance and the increase in ICSRs sent to the Anvisa. Another importance of the study is knowing the terms of interest can support the language to be used in risk communication. References/Further Sources of Information Not applicable.",1.0,,True

2084,"Introduction: Routine risk minimization measures (rRMM) are implemented for all pharmaceutical products, aiming to provide Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) and patients with information on a product's risks and benefits [1, 2]. However, some products may also require additional risk minimization measures (aRMM), which cover major risks and describe actions that should be taken upon risk occurrence [1, 2]. Such aRMM are usually distributed in a paperbased form to HCPs, which has its limitations. Therefore, digital versions of these aRMM have been under discussion in many pharmaceutical companies. An exploratory study by Da Silva-Tillmann et al [3] showed that HCPs and patients in 6 countries were open to the idea of digital tools for aRMM, and we sought to gain an initial impression of whether this would apply to HCPs in Egypt. Objective: This study aims to understand reactions of Egyptian HCPs to the idea of using digital tools for aRMMs along with or instead of paper tools. Methods: A digital aRMM tool was presented to Egyptian physicians, through a short video and tool demonstration. A questionnaire, distributed through social media platforms, was then used to gather HCP feedback. Results: The majority of responders were physicians from a variety of specialties (88%) and 12% were pharmacists. 90.9% of the HCPs who took the questionnaire thought that they would benefit from digital aRMM. Regarding the usefulness of the proposed features, 94% of respondents felt that information on safety concerns was useful, with 84% supporting inclusion of a prescribing guide, 79% finding emergency treatment information useful and 64% seeing benefit from a section on ``information to discuss with your patients''. In terms of whether a digital tool would be used instead of or alongside paper, 48.5% of respondents preferred a combined approach, with 51.5% supporting the use of digital alone. Nearly two-thirds of the HCPs surveyed would prefer to access a digital tool through a website and a mobile application, with only 3% preferring a website alone and 33% favoring an app-led approach. Sixty-six percent of respondents",1.0,social,True

Conclusion: Digital tools are widely used in healthcare and beyond, and may offer opportunities to improve HCP and patient engagement with key safety information.

Risk communication largely depends on active human interaction to be effective.1 The purpose of communicating drug safety information for healthcare providers (HCP) and the patient is to ensure the safe and effective use of medications postmarketing, which is one of duties of the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA). Objective: To share the Drug Safety and Risk Management Department (DSRM) initiatives for improving risk communication about medicines targeting healthcare providers (HCP) and the patients. Methods: We included all initiatives targeted HCPs and patients that were performed in 2021 to improve risk communication about medicines such as; scientific activities, short messages, training programs, publishing articles, animated videos as well as short videos. Results: DSRM at SFDA performed in 2021 many scientific activities directed to HCP such as; 36 educational lectures about pharmacovigilance and risk communication, 4 workshops conducted by local and international speakers in topics about vaccine safety, additional risk minimization measures (aRMMs) and risk communication, safe use of medications during pregnancy and drug interactions).

2102,"Introduction: Risk communication can be defined as the open, two way exchange of information and opinion about the harm and benefits. In the pharmaceutical industry in Ghana, one major way of communicating risks and benefits associated with a drug product to patients is through the patient information leaflet. This patient information leaflet (PIL) seeks to address the actual risk, the perceived risk as well as to explain why it matters to the patient or individual taking the drug product. However, several factors tend to interfere with the effectiveness of this approach. Notable among these factors are literacy, age, poverty. In view of this, effective communication supports the optimal use of medicinal products Objective: To develop principles to guide consistent and easily understood patient information leaflets to patients. Methods: Questionnaires were administered to randomly selected patients. A total number of 100 patients were involved in the study. The questionnaire sought to identify: 1. Patients who read the Patient Information leaflet 2. Patients who read and understand the Patient information Leaflet 3. Patients who read and understand the Patient Information Leaflet and adhere to the details provided in them. Results: The results showed that, out of the 100 patients who participated in the study, 56 of the patients could not read and understand the Patient Information Leaflet, 44 of the patients could read the Patient Information Leaflet.

2107,"Introduction: In the European Union (EU), a new Regulation for clinical trials of medicinal products came into effect 1st February 2022 specifying new requirements and timelines for important and urgent safety concerns (IUSCs) [1]. Also, globally, the requirements and guidance on IUSCs continue to evolve for clinical trials (CTs) and the post marketing (PM) setting, requiring a global and standardized approach. Objective: A decision tree was developed to improve harmonisation of safety concern assessment and classification, thus reducing the possibility of inconsistent global submissions to Health Authorities (HAs). Methods: The decision tree distinguishes between CT and PM scenarios. As active substances can have a marketing authorization while still being used in clinical trials, both paths may need to be followed. In the CT setting, if the safety signal has a potential impact on the benefit-risk balance or the overall conduct of a CT, it is important to decide if prompt notification and/or action is required. If it is, the IUSC can be classified as follows: (1) Urgent safety measure (reportable within 72 hours, EU within 7 days), (2) Unexpected event (reportable within 15 days), or (3) Temporary halt/early termination (reportable within 15 days). If the safety signal does not require prompt notification or action, an ``other concerns'' classification is followed: (1) Temporary halt in accordance with the protocol (reportable prior to restart), (2) Early termination (e.g., due to low recruitment/end of development; reportable within 15 days), or (3) Change in conduct of CT (e.g., increased monitoring measures; reportable as a substantial amendment in accordance with internal timelines). In the PM setting, IUSCs are classified as follows: (1) Emergent safety issue/significant safety issue (reportable within 72 hours, EU 3 business days), (2) Dear Health Care Professional Letter (as agreed with HA), or (3) Urgent safety restriction triggered by the marketing authorization holder (notification within 24 hours followed by a variation submission within 15 days). Other safety concerns are classified as follows: (1) Important risk (submitted within 3 months) or (2) Non-important risk (submitted within 6 months). Results: The IUSC decision tree streamlined and harmonized the implementation of global regulatory requirements, allowing the marketing authorization holder to provide a consistent classification of safety concerns and timely information to all impacted HAs. Conclusion: The enhanced tool supported teams in decision making regarding the classification of safety concerns and minimized intercountry variability in interpretation.

Methods: The oversight role of the Qualified Person for Pharmacovigilance (QPPV) in European Union (EU) was expanded to play an active role in the harmonized signal communication to HAs. Upon receipt of an MAH- or HA-identified signal or a HA-imposed safety action in the scope of the process (Day 0), a ``QPPV Notification'' is drafted by the QPPV Office. This draft is subsequently reviewed by subject matter experts, who are the MAH`s pharmacovigilance (PV) and regulatory professionals (Day 1). The decision to disseminate is made by the EU QPPV and is communicated to the MAH affiliates on Day 2. Country PV and regulatory personnel determine the appropriateness of notification to the country HA. This notification is performed in accordance with local regulatory requirements using the standard scientific wording provided in the QPPV Notification, ensuring that HAs worldwide receive the same information (Day 3). In the case of country-specific requirements, such as additional data (information, documents, etc.), these are provided to the HA as appropriate. The HA notification decision is independent of any subsequent regulatory activities. All HA notifications worldwide are internally tracked using the same unique identifier/code, provided by the QPPV Office to enable end-to-end oversight, from receipt (input) until notification (output) at the country level. Results: The implementation of the streamlined process ensures global regulatory requirements (e.g., EU [1], UK [2], Switzerland [3], Saudi Arabia, [4], and Australia [5]), are met and the MAH provides consistent and concise signal information to all HAs. Conclusion: The active role of the QPPV Office and the re-defined global process has been demonstrated to be effective in providing timely and consistent safety information to HAs around the world.

2122,"Introduction: Riluzole is a drug indicated to improve survival and time free from invasive mechanical ventilation (or tracheostomy) in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ASL). Riluzole is contraindicated in the presence of renal and/or hepatic impairment, after tracheostomy, or in patients with an ALS history of more than 5 years, and during pregnancy and breastfeeding [1-2]. Objective: This brief analysis aims to describe the use of riluzole in ALS individuals with contraindications and the off-label use for subjects with other motor neuron diseases (o-MND) in three Italian regions. Methods: A cohort of adults diagnosed with ALS and incident users of riluzole during the years 2016-2019 was enrolled from administrative databases of Latium, Tuscany and Umbria, excluding subjects with o-MND in the preceding 5 years. Being affected by ALS for more than 5 years, presence of tracheostomy, renal or hepatic failure were considered as contraindications to riluzole use. A cohort of adults affected by o-MND was enrolled in 2016-2019, for whom offlabel use of riluzole was retrieved, analysing over the time differences related to sex and Italian region. Results: Among 206 ALS individuals prescribed with riluzole in Latium, 336 in Tuscany and 60 in Umbria, less than 1% were diagnosed with ALS for more than 5 years. Less than 2% had undergone tracheostomy or were affected by hepatic failure. Renal failure was documented for 1.9%, 2.7%, and 5.0% of ALS individuals in Latium, Tuscany and Umbria. The o-MND cohort comprised 264 subjects in Latium, 222 in Tuscany, and 66 in Umbria. Non-negligible off-label riluzole use was observed: 8.5%, 33.0%, and 4.2% in females, and 19.9%, 26.5% and 2.4% in males in Latium, Tuscany and Umbria.",1.0,disease,True

2132,"Introduction: Immunisation against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella can be achieved with two different strategies: the combination of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine (available in Italy since the early 1990s) at the same time with the varicella vaccine (V) since 2005, or the use of the combined measles-mumps-rubellarubella-varicella vaccine (MMRV) available in the Veneto region since 2007. Several studies have compared the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and side effects of the two strategies since the introduction of MMRV [1-3]. There is evidence that shows a potential increased risk of febrile convulsions with the first dose of MMRV vaccine: several post-marketing surveillance studies have shown an approximately 2-fold increase for MMRV [4-5] Objective: To compare the safety profile of MMR ? V and MMRV by analysing data from the Italian spontaneous reporting system in Veneto region. Methods: All reports coming from the Veneto Region related to MMRV or MMR?V vaccines and sent to the national pharmacovigilance database up to the end of March 2022 were included. Among each vaccine group the proportion of reporting AEFI and the proportion of serious events were compared. Adverse events were grouped according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Results: A total of 5662 reports related to MMRV and 3848 reports related to MMR ? V were retrieved and analysed. A high number of these reports was collected within an active surveillance project on the safety profile of the first doses of both schedules. Most of the reports referred to infants (1 month to\ 2 years 94.5% of total reports for MMRV versus 99% for MMR ? V) and children (2-11 years 5.3% for MMRV versus 0.6% for MMR ? V). Proportion of serious reports was 19.7% (1116/5662) for MMRV and 9.7% (375/3848) for MMR ? V. Preferred terms (PT) most frequently reported were pyrexia (45.5% for MMRV versus 29,5% for MMR ? V), morbilliform rash (10.3% vs 12%) and post-vaccinal irritability (7.8% vs 14%). Among serious events the most frequent was hyperpyrexia (9% vs 3.7%, on the total PT reported). Febrile convulsions were 157 for MMRV (2.8%) and 43 for MMR ? V (1.1%) 140 febrile convulsions were reported in 1% of MMRV reports and 0.4% of MMR?V.",1.0,vaccine,True

Integrating both EPI and Iraqi pharmacovigilance center (IPC) systems at different levels to enforce the documentation, share COVID-19 adverse events following immunization (AEFIs), and effectively communicate safety information was crucial. Objective: Describe the steps taken to introduce a third level of the VigiFlow“ network at the level of hospitals and public health districts (PHDs). Methods: The VigiFlow“ network was expanded to include not only the 18 regional centers, but also the hospitals where the COVID-19 vaccines were deployed and the PHDs that are connected to the PPHCs. In order to integrate the proposed system for monitoring AEFIs of COVID-19 vaccines; the EPI manager at each Directorate of Health, granted access to the regional center database (VigiFlow“). Likewise, national EPI representatives would also have access to the national database at the ministry level (IPC). At the IPC level, the pool of data from all over the country will be available for analysis, signal detection, and decision-making. Induction training program was performed in collaboration with the WHO and EPI. An Arabic manual for using VigiFlow“ for AEFIs was distributed to users. UMC educational videos on how to use the VigiFlow“ were translated into Arabic and shared with all participants to facilitate the use of the VigiFlow“. A special guideline document was created with simple and comprehensive explanations of the AEFI reporting form(s) and how to transfer the information from the paper form to the VigiFlow“ system. pharmacovigilance officer at the national center was assigned the mission of supporting all the VigiFlow“ users across the country. Results: The results showed that 56% of the total COVID-19 vaccine VigiFlow“ AEFI reports were received through 3rd level VigiFlow“ organization users.

2184,"Introduction: Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that originate in endocrine tissues throughout the body characterized by an overexpression of somatostatin subtype 2 receptor, with an increasing incidence [1]. On September 2017 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide (Lutathera) through the centralized procedure based on the pivotal study Netter-1 [2]. This medicine was designated as an orphan drug and an additional monitoring was decided [3]. Lutathera was launched on the Italian market on October 2018 (class C non-negotiated) and on May 2019, the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) classified it in reimbursement's class ``H'' and its therapeutic innovation was recognized [4,5]. Related to the increased use of Lutathera in the real-world setting, important safety signals have emerged that require further investigations. Objective: This study aims to analyse adverse events (AEs) associated with Lutathera using real life data stored in the Eudra-Vigilance (EV) database over the last 12 months (up to 30/04/2022) and to compare them with data reported in the pivotal study [6]. Methods: AEs for Lutathera from April 2021 to April 2022 were extracted from EV database and processed with Microsoft Excel“; statistical tests were performed using Graphpad Prism“. Data are expressed in number and percentage (referred to all AEs on Lutathera reported in the EV database and in the Netter-1 trial, respectively) and classified per System Organ Class category. Real-world data and those of the pivotal trial were compared using chi-squared test (v2; CI 95%; p-value \ 0.05). Results: Data are reported considering the most clinically relevant categories based on the EPAR's Risk Management Plan (RMP). Reallife data confirmed that the most frequent AEs in patients treated with Lutathera were blood and lymphatic system, general, hepatobiliary, renal and urinary disorders and neoplasm as already stated in the RMP. Particularly, data from EV database show that patients treated with Lutathera have statistically significant higher risk of blood and lymphatic system (v2 , 14.62; P ,"" 0.0001), general (v2 "","" 26.94; P \ 0.0001), hepatobiliary (v2 "","" 17.04; P \ 0.0001), renal and urinary disorders (v2 "", 5.195; P\0.0226) and neoplasm (v2 ,"" 47.22; P \ 0.0001), when compared to patients included in Netter-1 trial (Table 1).""",1.0,trial,True

The outcomes include the rate and percentage of events associated with hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization, the age group and gender of patients in these reports, and the five most frequently reported events and medications related to hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization. All the findings were summarized using descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 44719 ADR were reviewed, of which 1649 (3.68%) met the inclusion criteria, in which 547 (1.23%) caused hospitalization, and 1102 (2.45%) prolonged it. Amongst these reports, the majority concerned males with 932 (56.52%), and the rest were females. Regarding age groups, 590 (35.77%) reports were adults and 92 concerned the pediatric population (5.60%), and the rest were not specified. The most frequently reported medications associated with hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization were; Heparin (6.36%), Lopinavir; Ritonavir (5.21%), warfarin (4.7%), Vancomycin (4.18%), and Favipiravir (2.66%). The most frequently reported events associated with hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization were; hepatotoxicity (136, 8.25%), allergic reaction (103, 6.2%), Prolonged Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) (72, 4.36%), increased International Normalized Ratio (INR) (65, 3.94%), and acute kidney injury (48, 2.91%). Conclusion: Although the percentage of ADEs associated with hospitalization remains relatively low, recommendations to achieve absolute medication safety should be placed. Future plans include increased efforts to promote awareness regarding medications frequently related to hospitalization and the implementation of future studies analyzing specific medications and events related to hospitalization.

2203,"Introduction: During the current pandemic, Covid-19 vaccination has become an indispensable solution for what used to be a normal life. Several side effects commonly reported with Covid-19 vaccination are injection site reactions, fatigue, and fever. Although not common, there have been some reports of hormonal disturbances such as menstrual irregularities and hair loss. A reasonable explanation of menstrual changes includes the effect of immune response activation on menstrual cycle driving hormones. Similarly, hair loss could be explained by the interrelation of the immune response with vaccination (1,2). Objective: To determine the rate and seriousness of menstrual disturbance and hair loss events following COVID-19 vaccine administration in Saudi Arabia using the Saudi Food and Drug Authority's (SFDA) spontaneous reporting system. Methods: a cross-sectional retrospective study measured the rate of spontaneous reports of hormonal change, including menstrual disorder and hormonal hair loss events, after the COVID-19 vaccine was received on SFDA electronic system from January 2021 to December 2021.

The study examines the rate and seriousness of the hormonal changes post-vaccination, specifically menstrual irregularities & hair loss (AEFI), for all covid-19 reports received from any stakeholders during 2021 and for all types of COVID-19 registered vaccines in Saudi Arabia including Pfizer (BNT162 vaccine), AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1-S) and Moderna (mRNA embedded in SM-102 lipid nanoparticles) vaccines. Results: During the study period, a total of 280,000 Adverse events Following Immunization (AEFI) reports with COVID-19 vaccines were received. Of all reports, 58 reports concerning menstrual disturbance and 20 reports concerning hair loss were identified. The majority of reported hair loss cases were female (95%). By vaccines, BioNTech BNT162 (14), AstraZeneca (5), Moderna (1). On the other hand, (76%) of menstrual disturbance cases occurred after administering BioNTech BNT162, followed by (17%) AstraZeneca, and a minor percentage was with Moderna at (7%). Regarding seriousness, from the total number of cases reported, 97% were non-serious. Conclusion: The association between hormonal disturbances and COVID-19 vaccines remains uncertain. Hence, further studies are warranted to investigate our observation. In conclusion, the key recommendation generated from the study is the implementation of awareness campaigns to promote an ADR reporting culture to correlate rare events occurrences with the use of COVID-19 vaccines.

Methods: Design: Cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the post marketing experience of Drug Ineffectiveness (DI) reports received by the Saudi Vigilance System (SFDA spontaneous reporting system) from January 2018 to December 2021. Setting: The SFDA manages the Vigilance reporting System, which receives spontaneous reports from healthcare providers, Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs), and patients directly. Outcomes: The study will be focus on which drugs are reported as being therapeutic ineffectiveness, what age group and gender chiefly report therapeutic ineffectiveness, and who is primarily reporting the therapeutic ineffectiveness (HCPs, MAHs, or patients). Results: A total of 2716 DI reports were included, in which the majority of them were reported from Health Care Providers (HCPs). Of all reports, 92% of the DI reports were classified as non-serious events and 8% of the DI reports were classified as serious events. Additionally, the study was found the percentage of males who experienced DI was higher than females. Conclusion: Reports of unexpected ineffectiveness can provide important information about Drug Ineffectiveness (DI). As such, unexpected or unexplained ineffectiveness can be potentially vital reportable event in pharmacovigilance. Additionally, Drug Ineffectiveness can occur as a result of different situations and can be contributed to different mechanisms. Therefore, an extensive research should be conducted to address inappropriate use, interactions or metabolic abnormalities and other factors that might contribute to Drug Ineffectiveness.

2221,"Methods: The reports from UK and Germany in the period JanuaryDecember 2021 were analyzed in VigiBase, the WHO global database of reported potential side effects of medicinal products, developed and maintained by Uppsala Monitoring Centre. Reports from the Apps were identified through the national country code. Reports in Veneto Region were analyzed in the regional database in the period February-December 2021. Reports sent from the Veneto vaccination registry through a direct link to spontaneous reporting database were excluded. Results: In 2021 UK submitted 450,819 AEFIs (56% serious, 85% from patients) to VigiBase, out of which 13,834 (3%) via the App (56% serious). In the same period Germany submitted 176,063 AEFIs (18% serious, 94% from patients) to VigiBase, 13,043 (7%) of which were sent via SafeVac (6% serious). Patients also contributed to Appreporting (86% in the UK vs 85% on the global level and 100% vs 94% on the global level) in UK and Germany, respectively.

Methods: A retrospective study was designed including all ADR reports received by INFARMED, IP., between January and December 2019 occurred in 65 and more year-old patients. Patients were characterized by age, gender, and notifier of the ADR. ADR were characterized according to MedDRA System Organs Classes (SOC), and seriousness, and medication according with the Anatomical Therapeutical Classification. Results: 2337 valid ADR reports occurred in older adults were considered. The population had a mean age of 74.6 ± 6.8 years old, up to a maximum of 97 years, with females representing 54.3% (n , 1189). Almost half of the reports were sent by physician (n ,"" 1137/48.7%), and users and non-health professionals participated in 14.4% (n "", 337) of the reports. 64.7% (n ,"" 1512) of the ADR reports were classified as serious. 600 older adults were hospitalized (25.7%) and 114 died (4.9%). It was possible to identify 6617 ADR, each report having an average of 2.83 ± 2.89 (min. 1; max 36) ADR. ``General Disorders and administration site conditions'' was the most frequent SOC, identified in 28.7% (n "","" 671) of reports, followed by ``Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders'', in 21.9% (n "","" 512). 3170 suspected medicines were identified, representing an average of 1.36 ± 1.07 drugs identified per report.

Although preclinical studies showed that immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) increased the risk of spontaneous abortion [2], whereby their use in pregnant women as well as in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception is not recommended [3], clinical cases of maternal exposure to ICIs reported in the literature to date showed successful pregnancy outcomes [4-6]. Objective: To provide further insight into ICI safety in pregnancy by querying VigiBase“, the World Health Organization's global pharmacovigilance database of safety reports of suspected adverse drug reactions. Methods: Pharmacovigilance study in VigiBase“ with disproportionality analysis using the reporting odds ratio (ROR). Safety reports concerning pregnancy-related outcomes reported in association with ICIs and gathered in VigiBase from its inception through August 17th 2020 were retrieved. Disproportionality analyses were performed for pregnancy-related outcomes reported in at least five safety reports associated with ICIs and compared to either the full database, other antineoplastic drugs (analysis by therapeutic area), or other antineoplastic drugs starting from 2011 (when the first-in-class ICI, ipilimumab, received marketing authorization). Results: Of 80 safety reports included in the study, median age was 32 years (interquartile range 28-35 years, n ,"" 35), and 77 (96.3%) were in females. Reporting of safety reports with ICIs in relation to pregnancy peaked in 2019 (25, 31.2%), and was mostly from health professionals (68, 85.0%). Exposure to ICIs occurred during pregnancy in 68 (85.0%) safety reports, more often to treat malignant melanoma (23, 28.8%). 41 (51.3%) safety reports reported only ICI exposure, 39 (48.7%) reported ICI exposure and additional adverse events related to pregnancy. The most frequently reported adverse events related to pregnancy were spontaneous abortion, foetal growth restriction, and premature delivery (in 5, 6, and 18 safety reports respectively), for which no signals of disproportionate reporting with ICIs emerged. Conclusion: This pharmacovigilance study showed that spontaneous abortion, foetal growth restriction, and premature delivery were not disproportionally more frequently reported with ICIs in VigiBase“. However, as signal detection depends on the number of safety reports, a signal of disproportionate reporting might be detected on larger samples, thus disproportionality analysis should be reassessed at regular intervals for confirmation or rejection.

2254,"Introduction: Initially, vaccination against Covid-19 was not recommended during pregnancy due to the lack of data. With the benefit of hindsight, it has become recommended. This decision followed the reassuring results from pregnant women who voluntarily or inadvertently received Covid-19 vaccines, especially with mRNA vaccines [1]. In Tunisia, from May 2021, pregnant women have been prioritized in the national vaccination program with the recommendation of the messenger RNA platform. Objective: To follow-up Covid-19 vaccinated pregnant and/or breastfeeding women in Tunisia. Methods: We have started a pilot study (from September 2021 to April 2022) for monitoring pregnant and/or breastfeeding women. Data collection was carried out via telephone calls. We excluded women who were unreachable after two phone calls. The data collected concerned the course as well as the outcome of the pregnancy and the health status of newborns. In addition, women were asked about the possible occurrence of adverse effects following immunization. Results: Our study included 1253 women. Seventeen percent of them were previously infected with Covid-19. The vaccination schedule was complete (two doses) in 83% of cases. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (PBV) was used in 73% of cases (11% of cases in the first trimester, 42% in the second trimester and 19% in the third trimester) and Moderna vaccine in 26%. Coronavac vaccine was used in 1% of cases. Vaccination was performed during pregnancy in 74 % of cases and breastfeeding in 11% of cases. Fifteen percent of women received the first dose during pregnancy and the second dose after childbirth.

2260,"Introduction: Antiepileptic drugs (AED) are widely used in pediatric population (PP). They are mainly indicated in the treatment of epilepsy and some psychiatric pathologies and behavioral disorders. AED are among the drugs most frequently associated with cutaneous adverse reactions (CAR) in children. These CAR are usually mild and disappear spontaneously after the AED withdrawal. However, severe life-threatening reactions can sometimes occur [1]. Objective: To study the epidemiological and clinical features of CAR occurring in PP and to identify the most implicated AED. Methods: We conducted a descriptive retrospective study over a period of seven years from January 2014 to December 2020 about CAR of AED in PP (aged under or equal to 16 years-old) notified to The Tunisian National Center of Pharmacovigilance. All cases were analyzed according to the updated French method of imputability [2]. Results: We collected 41 cases of CAR associated to AED.

2288,"Introduction: The post-marketing surveillance of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines revealed that urticarial reactions could occur with a delayed time course following both primary vaccinations [1-4] and the booster vaccinations [5,6]. While delayed urticarial reactions following COVID-19 primary vaccinations resolve in general with a median of 2-4 days, delayed urticaria after booster vaccination can show a prolonged and intermittent clinical course requiring treatment for several weeks [5,6]. Shortly after the booster vaccination campaign began in Switzerland in December 2021, an increasing number of delayed urticarial reactions in association with Spikevax“ was reported to Swissmedic, whereby a safety signal was opened. Objective: To characterize cases of delayed urticarial reactions reported in Switzerland following booster vaccination with Spikevax“. Methods: Case-by-case assessment of spontaneously reported delayed urticarial reactions following booster vaccination with Spikevax“ recorded in the Swiss national pharmacovigilance database up to February 8th, 2022. Results: There were 107 cases of delayed urticaria following booster vaccination with Spikevax“. Of these, 79 (73.8%) were reported by consumers/non-health professionals. Women were more frequently affected (55, 51.4%) and median age was 38 years (interquartile range, IQR, 34-44 years). Urticaria developed a median of 10 days after booster vaccination (IQR 9-11.5 days). In 55 (51.4%) cases, urticaria was the solely reported adverse event, whilst 52 (48.6%) cases reported urticaria with additional adverse events, including pruritus (n , 27) and angioedema (n ,"" 7). In 81 (75.7%) cases, delayed urticaria had not serious consequences (i.e. did not require/ prolonged hospitalisation, was not disabling/incapacitating, did not determine other clinically relevant conditions). In 69 (64.5%) cases the outcome of urticaria was not recovered at the time of reporting, which occurred a median of 14 days after booster administration (IQR 6-21 days). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first case series to date of delayed urticaria following booster vaccination with Spikevax“, showing that these reactions were more frequently not self-limiting and with a prolonged course in contrast to delayed urticaria developed after COVID-19 mRNA primary vaccinations. Although these reactions should not discourage from subsequent COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations, further investigations with regard to additional booster vaccinations seem necessary.

2295,"Introduction: Initial knowledge on the COVID-19 vaccines' safety from randomised clinical trials was limited and concerned mostly common adverse events related to vaccine immunogenicity occurring rapidly after vaccination [1,2]. Since these vaccines have been approved and used in large scale, the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products Swissmedic has been conducting an intensive surveillance activity on their safety, based on the collection and analysis of spontaneous reports from healthcare professionals and patients. Objective: Signal detection in spontaneous reports associated with COVID-19 vaccines first relies on a case-by-case analysis by clinically qualified assessors who take into account detailed information provided by reporters. However, with the number of reports increasing, the clinical review could benefit from the use of statistical methods for signal detection, such as disproportionality analysis [3]. Methods: In light of this, the Institute of Pharmacological Sciences of Southern Switzerland, in close collaboration with Swissmedic, set up and routinely perform a signal detection activity by disproportionality analysis in VigiBase“, the global database of the World Health Organization (WHO) Programme for International Drug Monitoring, using spontaneous reports originating from Switzerland and concerning adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) associated with the Moderna (Spikevax“) and Pfizer/BioNTech (Comirnaty“) COVID-19 vaccines. These included the measurement of the reporting odds ratios (RORs) for COVID-19 vaccine/AEFI combinations meeting two predefined statistical signal detection criteria, namely a minimum of 5 reports concerning a COVID-19 vaccine/AEFI combination and a ROR lower limit of the 95% confidence interval [ 1.

Results: Since the start of the signal detection activity in August 2021, an early signal of disproportionate reporting in VigiBase“ for paraesthesia with the Moderna (Spikevax“) vaccine was detected in Switzerland. This occurred a few months before the same signal was assessed and validated by the European Medicines Agency, which ultimately added paraesthesia to the European summary of product characteristics for the Moderna (Spikevax“) vaccine [4]. Conclusion: Disproportionality analysis has some limitations such as lack of information about incidence rate of the adverse event in the population, and the existence of reporting biases. Nevertheless, continued research on newly identified safety signals can provide valuable information to support public health, guide regulatory decisions and design specific follow-up confirmatory studies.

2307,"Introduction: The role of vitamin D on cardiovascular toxicity is a long-debated issue and some recent studies have associated its supplementation with adverse cardiovascular outcomes [1]. Its underlying mechanism probably involves an increased secretion of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) induced by calcitriol [2]. Indeed, FGF23 is a relevant biomarker of cardiovascular risk: while it physiologically inhibits phosphate renal tubular reabsorption, it seems to have a direct role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy,",1.0,,True
2308,"fibrosis and dysfunction [3]. This issue is particularly relevant in patients affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD), who have a higher cardiac failure risk compared to the general population, caused by a systemic inflammatory state that contributes to vascular and myocardial remodelling, calcification and senescence [4]. Furthermore, CKD patients typically develop hyperparathyroidism, have increased FGF23 concentrations and require vitamin D supplementation, which is due to the inability to activate 25-OH-calciferol into calcitriol and to the reduction of calcitriol concentrations induced by FGF23 [5]. All these factors concur in further increasing the risk of cardiovascular mortality in CKD, supporting the need for a thorough investigation of the toxic effects of vitamin D. Objective: To estimate the risk of reporting cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) triggered by the administration of vitamin D in a reallife context through the investigation of a comprehensive spontaneous reporting system database. Methods: We retrieved all Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) submitted to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) between 2010 and 2021 reporting vitamin D or its analogues as suspected in the AE occurrence. After a systematic process of data cleaning, we carried out a case-level clinical review of all ICSRs reporting CKD as indication of vitamin D use by analysing patient characteristics and the details concerning the AEs, coded by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Results: We identified 10,840 ICSRs reporting vitamin D as suspect drug, among which CKD was reported as its indication of use in 575 cases, which were retrieved and analysed: details on administered dose and frequency were provided in 192 cases, patients had a mean age of 61 ± 15 years and a 47% female prevalence. Cardiovascular disorders were reported in 203 cases and, based on their clinical outcome, over 90% AEs resulted of serious nature. Complete results are underway. Conclusion: Patients requiring vitamin D supplementation should be closely monitored and a careful benefit/risk ratio should be implemented in clinical practice.

2319,"Introduction: SFN is a relatively rare condition related to finer fibers of peripheral nervous system. A specific diagnostic procedure is necessary to reach a correct diagnosis.The most frequently reported symptoms are: pain (described as burning or a sensation of intense heat, as ``aching cold``, ''pinpricks``, ''electric shocks),paraesthesia (spontaneous sensations of tingling,numbness,itching),dysesthesia and allodynia. Some published papers hypothesized a correlation between SFN and anticovid vaccine. Objective: Study target was to analyze the adverse events following immunization (AEFI) reported in our ASL (resident population 1,221,857,  regional population) potentially linked to the SFN symptoms. Methods: Data relating to AEFI were extrapolated from the National Pharmacovigilance Network (NPN), while data referring to administered doses were extracted from the ASL QlinkView platform. Results: From 27 December 2020 to 26 April 2022, 624 reports, relating to vaccines anticovid AEFI, were received and recorded in the NPN. 2.109 AEFI were described in these reports. Administered vaccines: Comirnaty (346/624 sheets; 1.164/2.109AEFI; 2.092.042/ 3.028.781 total administered doses), the most reported AEFI were related to general pathologies: pain, wheal or erythema at the injection site, headache, fever, asthenia, nausea, malaise, tachycardia, muscle pain, fatigue, joint pain (25% of 1.164 AEFI). Other described symptoms: other pains, burning, itching, paraesthesia, tingling, numbness, allodynia, potentially linked to SFN (17.3% of 1.164 AEFI); Spikevax (112/624 sheets; 392/2.109 AEFI; 607.626/ 3.028.781 doses),the most reported AEFI, like Comirnaty, were related to the injection site (26% of 392 AEFI), while the potentially symptoms related to SFN were the 20.2% of 392 AEFI; Vaxzevria (146/624 sheets; 512/2.109 AEFI; 298.188/3.028.781 doses), the most reported AEFI, related to general pathologies, were the 33% of 512 AEFI, while potentially symptoms related to SFN were the 18.8%. Finally, as regards the Janssen vaccine (10/624 sheets; 32/2.109 AEFI; 30.702/3.028.781 doses), the most described events, related to general pathologies, are the 47% of the 32 AEFI, while 31% are potentially linked to the of SFN symptoms. No AEFI was reported related to the 223 doses about Novavax vaccine. The causality assessment was defined correlatable about 37 records (6% of 624 records). 12/37 records describe potentially linked to SFN symptoms (6 Vaxzevria (1%), 3 Comirnaty (0.5%) and 3 Spikevax (0.5%)). Conclusion: The analysis about AEFI reported in our ASL related to anticovid vaccines underlined the existence of symptoms potentially linked to SFN, although only in a few cases it was evaluated a causality assessment to vaccination. Just a specific diagnostic procedure can confirm the diagnosis and the correlation. Therefore, the correlation between SFN and vaccine needs larger-scale studies and insights for a correct evaluation. References/Further Sources of Information Waqar Waheed MD, Magalie E.

2324,"Introduction: After many months from the COVID-19 pandemic beginning, several anti-spike monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and, more recently, other antiviral drugs for COVID-19 treatment in nonhospitalized patients have been marketed. Specifically, those drugs are indicated for SARS-CoV-2 infection early treatment in outpatient adults at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 [1]. Objective: To evaluate the post-marketing safety profile of antivirals drugs used for early COVID-19 treatment, using the World Health Organization global spontaneous reporting database (VigiBase). Methods: From VigiBase we identified all the individual case safety reports (ICSRs) of marketed mAbs (regdanvimab, sotrovimab, casirivimab/imdevimab, bamlanivimab/etesevimab and, specifically for COVID-19 prevention in immunocompromised patients, tixagevimab/cilgavimab) and other antiviral therapies for COVID-19 early treatment (remdesivir, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, molnupiravir). We performed a descriptive analysis of ICSRs recorded in VigiBase of patients' demographics (age, sex, continent of origin) type of reporter, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (Preferred Term level) and the Important Medical Events (IMEs), from their marketing date to May 4, 2022. In addition, we conducted a disproportional analysis using Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), by comparing the frequency of ADRs (System Organ Class level) for each drug of interest with distribution of all ADRs from the whole database, excluding vaccines, reported in the same period. Results: Overall, up to 4th May,2022, 15,437 ICSRs of anti-spike mAbs (casirivimab/imdevimab: 27.2%; bamlanivimab/etesevimab: 7.3%; sotrovimab 3.3%; tixagevimab/cilgavimab 2.7% regdanvimab: 0.2%) and other antivirals (remdesivir: 54.5%; nirmatrelvir/ritonavir: 4.3%; molnupiravir 0.5%) from VigiBase were retrieved. ICSRs mainly involved females and 45-64 years old. The percentage of ICSRs that included IMEs was 32.4%. Overall, the most frequently reported ADRs were infusion-related reaction for both casirivimab/ imdevimab (20.1%) and bamlanivimab/etesevimab (19.3%), pyrexia for regdanvimab (30.0%) and sotrovimab (8.1%), increased alanine aminotransferase for remdesivir (13.3%), dysgeusia for nirmatrelvir/ ritonavir (39.5%), and diarrhoea for molnupiravir (18.8%). Overall, statistically significant RORs were observed for ``Investigations'' with remdesivir (N ,"" 3163; ROR: 5.56; 95% CI 5.32-5.81), ``Gastrointestinal disorders'' for molnupiravir (N "", 178; ROR: 3.43; 95% CI 2.82-4.17) and ``Vascular disorders'' for sotrovimab (N , 51; ROR: 2.07; 95% CI 1.55-2.76). Conclusion: This study shows that the safety profile of anti-spike mAbs and other newly marketed antiviral therapies for the early treatment of COVID-19 is overall favourable. The most frequently reported ADRs in VigiBase are in line with those reported in the pivotal trials and Summary of Product Characteristics for all investigated antiviral drugs. The disproportional analysis identified some potential signals requiring further investigation. References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,COVID-19,True

2332,"Introduction: Idarucizumab is a specific reversal agent for dabigatran that was approved in 2015 to restore coagulation. The drug is administered only during inpatient or emergency care: in such settings, its use is poorly captured by most real-world databases. Objective: To retrieve individual level information on idarucizumab use from an Italian record-linkage claims database to describe main characteristics of users. Methods: All person-years (PYs) exposed to dabigatran from January 2015 to December 2020 were calculated from record-linkage claims database, using defined daily doses to estimate the duration of each dispensation. Idarucizumab use was identified from inpatients and/or emergency care, and incidence rate was calculated over PYs of dabigatran use. To identify patients treated with idarucizumab, emergency visits and hospital discharge records were probabilistically linked to dabigatran users, matching date and ward of admission. A further selection was made by a manual assessment of diagnoses and indications of idarucizumab use. The hierarchical criteria used to match each idarucizumab record to a single patient were: (a) date of dabigatran initiation; (b) clinical outcome; (c) diagnosis. Subsequently, each association between idarucizumab administration and hospitalization/emergency visit was ranked as (1) probable, (2) possible, (3) incompatible, (4) non assessable. Linked users were described in terms of indication and followed-up for 30 days to assess mortality. Results: During the study period, 49,134 PYs of dabigatran use were observed, and 249 administrations of idarucizumab were recorded, corresponding to 5.1 (95% CI 4.5-5.7) per 1,000 PYs. At the end of the manual assessment 158 (69.0%) administrations were defined as probable (N , 103) or possible (N ,"" 55). Overall, 230 idarucizumab administrations (92.4%) were linked to at least one patient. Each administration was associated with a median number of 8 hospitalization/emergency visits (interquartile range: 3-14). Hospitalizations/ emergency visits referred to 126 patients: 109 (86.5%) with one administration of idarucizumab, 11 (8.7%) with two administrations, 5 (4.0%) with three administrations, and 1 (0.8%) with four. Most of them were men (62.7%), with a median age of 79.1 years. Indications were emergency surgical procedures and life-threatening bleeding in 43 (34.1%) and in 83 (65.9%) patients, respectively. Overall, 30-days mortality was 23.0% (N "", 29). Conclusion: This drug utilization study highlights the potential of the Tuscany administrative database in retrieving patient-level information on idarucizumab use and sets the stage for post-marketing surveillance on its safety profile in a real-world setting.

2342,"Introduction: In 2004, the European Medicines Agency issued a first warning on the increased risk of stroke and all-cause mortality associated with the use of olanzapine and risperidone, extending this warning in 2009 to all antipsychotics (APs) employed in individuals with dementia. In addition, the use of APs appears to be associated also with an increased risk of pneumonia. Objective: As part of ANTIGONE (ANTIpsychotics General pOpulatioN safEty study), a regional project financed by AIFA, the Italian Medicines Agency, a study with the aim to evaluate the use of APs in the population resident in the territory of the Central Tuscany Healthcare Authority (Tuscany, Italy) was conducted. Methods: A descriptive analysis using information contained in the dataset of drug dispensing records, which are coded using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical drug classification system adopted by the World Health Organization, was carried out in order to estimate prevalent users. A record-linkage was done deterministically by means of the universal anonymous identifier, which is adopted within all the electronic health records of the Regional Health System of Tuscany, between drug dispensing records, the dataset of hospital discharge records, with one main and five secondary diagnoses coded using the International Classification of Diseases, the emergency department dataset and mortality data. Results: From 2014 to 2018 prevalent users in the territory ranged among 23,828 in 2016 (1.5 per 100 residents) and 20,539 in 2018 (1.3 per 100 residents), while the median age ranged from 65 in 2014 to 61",1.0,Disease,True

APs use among patients[64 years was 55% among women and 34.2% among men in 2018. Among AP users, 0.7% had a diagnosis of dementia. Around 1/3 of prevalent cases each year was admitted to the emergency department and/or hospitalised for any cause. Each year 2.5% of prevalent users were hospitalised with a diagnosis of a cerebro- or cardiovascular disease, and 2% were hospitalised with a primary diagnosis of pneumonia. Conclusion: Considering these preliminary findings, the risks associated with APs use will be assessed among incidence users one year after the start of therapy. Particular attention will be paid to the risk of emergency department admission or hospitalisation for cerebro- and cardiovascular diseases and pneumonia, and a specific analysis on patients suffering from dementia will be conducted.

Objective: We aim to describe cytolytic hepatitis following administration of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Methods: We report a case of cytolytic hepatitis following administration of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine notified to the National Center of Pharmacovigilance. Results: A 37-year-old man with no notable medical history was incidentally diagnosed with cytolytic hepatitis during his preoperative lab tests for acute appendicitis. Liver transaminases were thrice the upper limit. He had received his two doses of mRNA vaccine Moderna“ two months before getting his lab tests. His serum immunoglobulins G, A, and M levels were within the normal range, and his immune lab tests were normal. Hepatitis serologies were negative. The abdominal ultrasound didn't demonstrate any abnormalities. The liver biopsy has revealed chronic active hepatitis lesions classified as F1A2. The patient had recovered spontaneously and had a normal liver transaminase level within 10 days. This case was scored I3 according to the french imputability updated method.

2371,"Introduction: Myocarditis was observed after the commercialization of mRNA vaccines and was not initially described in the safety data of these vaccines [1,2]. Lately, it was considered an adverse effect of mRNA vaccines and mentioned in the summary of product characteristics. Objective: In this work, we aim to present the cases of myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination reported during the vaccination campaign. Methods: We present the cases of myocarditis reported to the pharmacovigilance national center after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Data were collected retrospectively. All cases were defined according to Brighton's case definition of myocarditis. The vaccine causality assessment was estimated by the French imputability updated method of Be¥gaud et al. [3]. Results: A total of six patients were included in this study. The sex ratio (M/F) was 0.5. The mean age was 31 years ranging from 18 to 41 years. All patients had no notable cardiovascular history and did not report any significant past medical history. The mean onset delay was 10 days post-vaccination. The predominant reported symptoms are chest pain and dyspnea in the six cases. Five patients have received an mRNA vaccine and one patient a viral vector vaccine. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the myocarditis diagnosis in five patients (not performed for one patient). All patients presented a troponin serum level elevation. The ejection fraction was reduced for five patients and conserved for one patient. All cases were classified as definitive cases according to the Brighton case definition of myocarditis. One patient required hospitalization in a cardiac intensive care unit. All the patients have recovered from acute myocarditis within a few days. Five cases were scored I2 and one case I1 according to the French updated imputability method.

2378,"Introduction: TreeScan and associated techniques have been successfully applied to Real-World Data (RWD) such as administrative claims and electronic health records (EHR) to identify associations within large datasets [1,2,3]. FDA is commonly implementing TreeScan for signal detection and the use of RWD in support of pharmacovigilance (PV) is increasing [4,5]. TreeScan can be employed using an exposure-based approach or an outcome-based approach [6]. Gaining access to curated and harmonized global RWD, let alone federated data, remains challenging and additional research must be performed with these data so that the PV community may leverage them in the future. Objective: To investigate using TreeScan on a federated EHR network by implementing an exposure-based and an outcome-based analysis focusing on previously identified associations: COX-2 inhibitors and increased CV events and increased risk of suicide to Benzodiazepine [7,8,9,10]. Methods: Using the TriNetX Network, we created two cohorts for exposure-based comparison (COX-2/NSAIDS) and 2 for outcomebased comparison (suicide/non-suicide). The NSAIDS cohort included patients exposed to ibuprofen and the COX-2 cohort included patients exposed to valdecoxib, celecoxib, or rofecoxib. Both cohorts included patients exposed from 1999-2004 to reflect prior investigations and ensure COX-2 exposures. Suicide was defined using ICD10-CM codes T14.91, R45.851 and X71-X83. These cohorts included patients from 2014-2019. Data from 26 healthcare organizations were curated to a common terminology. We focused on executing these methods across a federated network of EHR data and limited signal assessment to several known associations. The federated TriNetX Platform was used to calculate diagnosis and medication hierarchies for the exposure and outcome analyses respectively. TreeScan v1.4 was used to calculate statistics. Results: 27,579 NSAIDs and 16,285 COX-2 patients were identified. CV disease signaled at the top of the hierarchy along with arterial disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, and pulmonary heart disease. The relative risk of myocardial infarction was 1.63 [Unspecified: 1.97; NSTEMI: 1.70; STEMI: 1.56] p-value 0.001 in the COX-2 cohort as compared to the NSAIDs cohort. 10,636 first suicide and 382,277 non-suicide patients were identified. As expected, Benzodiazepine derivatives were associated to the first suicide cohort with a relative risk of 2.17 [Clonazepam: 2.56; Lorazepam: 3.34] p-value 0.001.",1.0,community,True

In the past two years, VAC4EU has proven preparedness and efficiency in designing post-authorization monitoring for COVID-19 vaccines responding to the requests of both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and vaccine manufacturers Objective: To describe the VAC4EU organization, data, tools and the accomplishments made towards the generation of real-world evidence on vaccine benefit-risk evaluation. Methods: Not applicable. Results: Since its creation in October 2019, VAC4EU has established a large research network composed of 24 institutions from 9 European countries (BE, DE, DK, FR, IT, NL, NO, ES, UK) providing access to different health care data sources covering more than 150 million European citizens. VAC4EU has implemented a research infrastructure including a catalogue, a codemapper tool, a sharepoint, Github, digital research environment (DRE), a phenotype library of more than 100 variables with definitions and a Zenodo community to facilitate collaboration, transparency, and federated data analysis. VAC4EU has adopted the ConcePTION common data model as a basis for the structural harmonization of electronic health data, but it also allows for primary data collection. VAC4EU has consolidated its governance structure for implementation of pharmacovigilance studies on vaccines and successfully participated in four public tenders regarding vaccines safety and effectiveness launched by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [1-3] as well as four required post-authorization safety studies on COVID-19 vaccines sponsored by vaccine manufacturers [4-8], and other studies promoted by the Global Vaccine Data Network. All protocols developed within VAC4EU are registered in the EU PAS register, and results are published in the open science VAC4EU Zenodo community. Conclusion: We know already from the H1N1 pandemic that collaboration is needed to study vaccine effects. This collaboration was designed and tested in the IMI-ADVANCE project and implemented in VAC4EU. VAC4EU has demonstrated readiness of its research framework making a key difference in COVID-19 vaccine monitoring in Europe. Research and public health organizations can join the initiative.

2427,"Introduction: According to WHO, the path towards cervical cancer elimination includes to fully vaccinate 90% of all girls by the age of 15 by 2030. Moreover, in order to eradicate worldwide even others HPV related cancers (i.e. head and neck region, anal and genital cancers) efforts need to be implemented to extend vaccination also in male population [1-2]. In Veneto Region HPV vaccine is actively offered to 12 years old females since 2008, and to 12 years old males since 2015. Since 2018, the Veneto Region started offering the 9vHPV vaccine, which is currently administered for routine immunization. Objective: To describe and compare the safety profile of 4vHPV and 9vHPV in the Veneto Region, according to spontaneous reporting Methods: All AEFIs referred to HPV, collected in the Veneto Region and inserted in the Italian Spontaneous reporting database up to March 31th 2022, were analysed. Adverse events are classified according to MedDRA terminology. Results: In the study period, 638 cases and 1320 reactions associated to HPV vaccination were received: 470 cases referred to 4vHPV (74%) and 168 to 9vHPV (26%). Serious reactions were 49 (10.4%) for 4vHPV and 22 (13.1%) for 9vHPV. Reports in female subjects were 89% in 4vHPV (9.3% serious) and 67% in 9vHPV (11.6% serious). Reports in male subjects were 11% in 4vHPV (20.8% serious) and 33% in 9vHPV (16.7% serious). The most reported systemic reactions were headache (114 reports, 18% of 4vHPV and 17% of 9vHPV reports), hyperpyrexia (65 reports, 9% of 4vHPV and 13% of 9vHPV reports), fever (64 reports, 11% of 4vHPV and 8% of 9vHPV reports) and urticaria (56 reports, 10% of 4vHPV and 6% of 9vHPV reports). Hyperpyrexia was present in almost half of serious reports.

Since then, community pharmacists dispense medicinal cannabis to patients, alongside related finished medicinal products or cannabis extracts. In terms of suspected quality and safety issues, German pharmacists are obliged to report adverse drug reactions (ADR) and quality defects (QD) to the Drug Commission of German Pharmacists (AMK). Objective: Analyses of spontaneously reported ADR and QD of medicinal cannabis (formulations). Methods: The AMK database was analyzed between January 1, 2014 and March 31, 2022 for reports of QD and ADR related to cannabis flowers, cannabinoid-containing finished medicinal products, and other cannabis extracts. Various cannabis medicines were clustered: (i) finished products (Sativex“, Canemes“, Epidyolex“); (ii) cannabidiol formulations; (iii) dronabinol formulations; (iv) cannabis flowers, and (v) cannabis extract. These clusters were examined for number of reports received, frequency and types of QD and ADR, as well as patient characteristics.

The goal of the guidance is for all parties to focus on reporting of suspected adverse reactions that are serious and unexpected. A wealth of adverse event data are available in the ClinicalTrials.gov website. These data are not standardized and require processing but once available in a standard format and dashboard can be used effectively as part of a safety surveillance plan. Objective: The objective of this project was to collect, standardize and visualize adverse event data from ClinicalTrials.gov website in a dashboard. The dashboard will enable safety teams to more effectively identify potential anticipated events in clinical research. Methods: A direct connection to the clinicaltrials.gov database was established to extract all relevant data. Preliminary processing steps were necessary to ingest the data in a standard process. Due to the volume of data available a limited number of cancer indications were selected by filters included in the clinicaltrials.gov database, manually reviewed and standardized. All Adverse event terms were extracted and will be reviewed and standardized. A dashboard was created utilizing Tableau (version 2021.3.6) in order to visualize the data. Results: The dashboard allows for the easy filtering and selection by several parameters. The user can select the condition, study ID, study arm, therapy, trial phase, age group, gender, AE term or event seriousness. The results of all trials describing the number of studies and subjects included is displayed along with the count and frequency of all adverse event reported across studies if no filter is applied for adverse events. Additional features including statistical measures that will summarize the cohorts under study will be included as future enhancements. Conclusion: Visualization of adverse event data from the clinicaltrials.gov database will provide a useful way to establish background rates of adverse events in various patient populations that will assist in interpretation and contextualization of events that are observed in clinical studies. Using these data will improve a sponsor's ability to focus on reporting of suspected adverse reactions that are serious and unexpected.

2457,"Introduction: Docetaxel is a chemotherapeutic medication used to treat several types of neoplasms, such as lung, breast, prostate, bladder, head, neck and gastroesophageal cancer. It is available on the pharmaceutical market in the trihydrate (reference medicine) and anhydrous forms (generic). Few studies has compared pathological responses among oncology outpatients who used different pseudopolymorphic forms of this medication [1-5]. Objective: To compare the pathological response of trihydrate and anhydrous forms of docetaxel 80 mg among patients assisted in an oncology outpatient clinic in Brazil. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in an oncology outpatient clinic located in Sa~o Paulo, Brazil. Patients aged over 18 years old assisted in the clinic from 2018 to 2020, whose chemotherapy regimens included doxetacel as monotherapy or in combination with other cytotoxic drugs were included. Chart review was carried out to collected data related to demographic characteristics, clinical history and pathological response of participants. Pathologic complete response (pCR) was defined as no invasive and no in situ residuals in tissue samples after chemotherapy [6]. Results: Of the 503 patients who met the inclusion criteria, most were female (78.7%). The mean age of patients was 56.7 years old (SD 12.4). Breast cancer (74.3%), II (34.6%) and III (37.2%) clinical stages of cancer, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (42.1%) were the most common characteristics observed. Trihydrate docetaxel was used by 55.1% patients, anhydrous form by 23.1%; both forms by 21.8%. pCR were observed, respectively, in 62.9%; 25.7% and 11.4%. Conclusion: Most patients used the trihydrate form of docetaxel, the pseudopolymorphic that presented the best result for pathologic complete response. However, to ensure that the reference drug is more effective, more studies need to be carried out evaluating not only the effectiveness, but also the safety of the drug.

2468,"Introduction: Promethazine, a first-generation antihistamine, was initially developed for allergies. However, promethazine is today primarily used as a sedative and hypnotic. Promethazine has been approved in Sweden since the 1950s in children over 2 years of age and restricted to prescription only. In recent years, the prescribing of promethazine has increased considerably in Sweden. Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivate and overdose can result in severe intoxication potentially leading to CNS depression, respiratory depression, and even fatalities (1). Objective: We aimed to investigate if the increased use of promethazine was related to increased number of intoxications. Methods: We compared the number of patients per year that were prescribed promethazine with the number of calls to the poison centre concerning promethazine, and with deaths where promethazine was assessed during forensic autopsy as a direct contributor to the death. Prescription data were collected from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register (SPDR), number of consultative calls about acute poisonings were collected from the Swedish Poison Information Centre (SPIC), and number of deaths were collected from the Swedish National Board of Forensic Medicine. Data were collected between 2016 and 2021. Results: Statistics from the SPDR show that the total prescribing of promethazine increased from 88,568 patients in 2016 to 185,419 in 2021 (109 % increase). This increase can be seen in all age groups except the youngest (0-4 years) and the oldest (85? years). In 2021, 68 % of those filling prescriptions for promethazine were women. The number of calls to the SPIC increased from 1,133 calls in 2016 to 2,073 calls in 2021 (83 % increase). Most calls concerned intentional overdose. Between 2016 and 2021, promethazine was assessed during forensic autopsy as directly contributing to the death in about 20 cases per year (16, 14, 18, 27, 22, and 22, respectively). Most of the cases (58 %) were considered suicides and 68 % of the deaths occurred in women. Conclusion: The increased number of intoxications as measured by calls to the poison centre seems to be related to the increased prescribing of promethazine. Similarly, deaths confirmed by forensic autopsy show a slight increase during the study period. Calls to the poison centre as well as deaths mainly involved intentional overdose/suicide. When prescribing promethazine it is important to consider the risks of severe intoxication in case of overdose and to prescribe the minimal possible amount.

2477,"Introduction: The prevalence of cannabis preparations utilization has increased worldwide (1,2). The evidence on their risk-benefit profile remains unclear (3). Post-marketing surveillance plays a crucial role in generating evidence on the safety of these formulations. Objective: This study aimed to characterize post-marketing adverse drug events (ADEs) related to the use of cannabidiol (CBD), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and nabilone reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: We used the FAERS quarterly data from January 2004 to December 2021 to identify cannabis products (CBD, THC, and nabilone). Sociodemographic characteristics of the patients reporting cannabis-related ADEs were described. The reporting odds ratios (ROR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for important medical events to detect signals of disproportionate reporting for the three different products. Product labels were used to highlight unexpected signals. Results: We retrieved 27,868 cases of cannabis-related ADEs, of which 40.1% involved CBD, 24.0 % THC, and 3.2% nabilone. Patients with CBD-related ADEs were younger (median: 46 years; IQR: 23-61) than those with THC (56; 42-67) and nabilone (51; 37-61). Reports involved more often women (60.5% of CBD, 48.8% of THC, and 67.1% of nabilone ADEs). For CBD, the ADE outcomes were more often non-serious (54.6%), with life-threatening or death events reported, respectively, in 1.1% and 4.6% of ADEs. Nevertheless, CBD was considered as primary suspect of the ADE in 72.1% of reports. THC and nabilone were more often recorded as concomitant therapy and not as the real cause of ADE (84.0% and 83.0%, respectively) and associated with more serious outcomes (death: 19.2% for THC and 8.5% for nabilone; hospitalization: 32.2% for THC and 31.4% for nabilone). The analysis of important medical events revealed mostly known events such as drug abuse for CHT (ROR ,"" 3.84; 95% CI 3.11-4.70), or events possibly related to indication bias, such as seizure for CBD (31.89; 30.53-33.35), failure to thrive for THC (25.11; 18.95-32.64), and rheumatoid arthritis for nabilone (14.26; 10.85-18.43). New signals emerged for THC, such as febrile neutropenia (4.81; 3.92-5.84), pancytopenia (3.56; 2.8-4.5), thrombocytopenia (2.54; 2.07-3.09), renal failure (2.21, 1.83-2.65), chronic kidney disease (3.66, 3.01-4.41), and deep vein thrombosis (2.62, 2.05-3.30). For CBD, new signals were pneumonia (1.29, 1.14-1.46) and pneumonia aspiration (4.10, 3.16-5.24). Conclusion: Cannabis preparations seem to have, in general, a safe profile. Nevertheless, cytopenia, kidney-related conditions, and thrombosis were reported with THC and pneumonia with CBD.

2484,"Introduction: The use of cannabis for recreational purposes is associated with an increased risk of psychotic disorders (1,2). However, the risk of psychosis is not well characterized for patients using cannabis for medical purposes. Objective: Thus, this study assessed the risk of emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalization for psychotic disorders among adult patients authorised by their healthcare providers to use cannabis to treat a health condition in Ontario, Canada, from 2014 to 2020. Methods: This was a longitudinal retrospective cohort study of patients who received medical cannabis authorization and followedup in cannabis clinics, matched by high dimensional propensity scores to population-based controls (with a ratio of patients in cannabis clinics to controls of 1:3). Clinical and health administrative data were used. The primary outcome was an ED visit or hospitalization with a primary diagnosis reason (ICD-10 codes) related to psychotic disorder. Conditional Cox proportional hazards regressions accounting for the matching were used to assess the risk. Results: A total of 60,414 cannabis patients were matched to 180,397 controls. Less than half of the patients (42%) were aged B 50 years, and 54% were female. Incidence rates for psychotic disorders were 2.25/1000 person-years (95% CI 2.02-2.51) in the cannabis group and 1.56/1000 person-years (95% CI 1.45-1.68) in the control group. The hazard ratio (HR) based on the conditional Cox model further adjusted for age, sex, and history of psychotic disorders was 1.25 (95% CI 1.05-1.36). Among patients without a history of psychotic disorders, the HR was 1.25 (95% CI 1.07-1.46). Conclusion: Medical cannabis authorization was associated with an increased risk of ED visits or hospitalization for psychotic disorders. Careful benefit-risk assessment is needed before medical cannabis authorization. References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,Clinical,True

2493,"Introduction: Lassa fever (LF) is endemic over most of West Africa and a third of LF survivors develop sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Multiple LF vaccine candidates are in the development pipeline. In February 2020, the Brighton Collaboration Safety Platform for Emergency vACcines (SPEAC) project has developed a case definition to assess SNHL as an adverse event of special interest for LF vaccines [1,2]. Objective: To assess the applicability of this SNHL case definition to data collected in routine clinical care settings at a tertiary hospital in Ghana. Methods: The study subjects were patients aged 18-59 years who attended the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Department at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital between 1 January 2007 and 30 June 2020. We used the keywords ``hearing loss'', ``sensorineural hearing loss'', or ``SNHL'' to retrospectively identify eligible patients from electronic (EMR) and paper medical records. We applied the Brighton Collaboration criteria for level of diagnostic certainty (LOC) ascertainment to up to 300 potential SNHL cases, by date from the most recent patient backwards. The following parameters were assessed: (1) completeness to obtain information on each criterion of the case definition; (2) ability to assign LOC up to level 3, and what LOC was ascertainable; (3) ability to achieve the same LOC for the same case by different assessors; and (4) reasons for being unable to classify cases. Results: Overall, 860 eligible cases were identified; data from 42 EMR and 258 paper case records were abstracted (median age 43 years, 55% male). Most SNHL cases were assessable (85.0%) and assigned level 1 LOC (84.3%); missing information on otoscopy (86.7%) was the main reason for being unable to classify cases. Consistency of LOC classification between assessors was 99.3%. Completeness on the recorded evidence of otoscopy (38.1% vs 93.7%, p \ 0.001), tympanometry (38.1% vs 93.4%, p \ 0.001), and audiometry (30.9% vs 93.0%, p \ 0.001) was lower in EMRs than in paper records. Other diagnostic tools, including Tuning fork exam, auditory brainstem response test, otoacoustic emissions test, behavioral or neurodevelopmental assessment, and remote screening were rarely documented. Conclusion: The Brighton Collaboration SNHL case definition would be applicable to retrospectively ascertain and classify cases in resource-limited settings. Developing an EMR template to document otoscopy results may improve the feasibility at this hospital to ascertain SNHL in the context of an LF vaccine trial or postintroduction.

2499,"Introduction: The first description of a medical use of DMF dates back to 1959, when biochemist Schweckendiek highlighted the benefits on psoriasis [1]. In 1994, DMF was approved in Germany under the trade name Fumaderm“ for the treatment of psoriasis [2]. Subsequently, several new therapeutic uses were proposed, like the treatment of multiple sclerosis [3]. Currently in Europe, DMF is available as Tecfidera“, approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2013 for the treatment of multiple sclerosis [4] and Skilaren“, approved in 2017 for the treatment of psoriasis [5]. The side effects most frequently associated with DMF are those of flushing and gastrointestinal complaints. Less frequent side effects include a reduction in the number of lymphocytes and liver disorders [6]. Objective: To evaluate the trend of reports of adverse reactions from DMF in the region of Sardinia. Methods: An analysis on the National Pharmacovigilance Network database has been conducted up to May 4th, 2022 and for the Region of Sardinia alone, including both approved medicinal products. Various percentage frequencies were calculated on the reports found. Results: There were found 26 reports, of which, 22 were from health professionals, 4 from patients/citizens, 22 reports were non-serious, and 4 reports were serious. In 16 out of 26 (61%) reports, the time-toonset (TTO) was less than one month. 8 out of 26 (31%) patients were younger than 35 years old, 7 out of 26 patients (27%) were older than 50, 19 patients were female (73%) and 7 male (27%). 9 out of 26 (34%) reactions were characterized by hypersensitivity reactions, 7 out of 26 (27%) were gastrointestinal reactions, one reaction (4%) of lymphocytopenia, one reaction with increased transaminases (4%), one reaction of alopecia (4%). 10 of the reports (38%) were submitted by November 2018, 16 reports (62%) were submitted from August 2020 through May 4th, 2022. Conclusion: The reported adverse reactions are divided into 3 main subgroups, in line with literature data, and cases of liver damage and alopecia were also reported. Adverse reactions predominantly affect the female sex, and most reactions did not require hospitalization. The time gap of reporting between the end of year 2018 and mid 2020 could get further investigation to clarify whether it's related to the Pharmacovigilance signals that led the European regulatory authority to re-establish the risk-benefit ratio for this drug in the year 2018.

Objective: To investigate adverse events potentially associated with the use of the four anti-CGRP mAbs (erenumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab, eptinezumab) captured in the real-world setting by using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: We performed a case/non-case pharmacovigilance study with disproportionality analysis on FAERS reports submitted over the 2004-2021 period. Reports with any suspect anti-CGRP mAb were selected as cases and compared with all the reports not recording antiCGRPs. Descriptive analyses were performed to investigate the demographic and reporting characteristics associated with cases relative to non-cases, testing for significant differences. Both raw and adjusted (on sex and age) Reporting Odds Ratios (RORs) were calculated as a measure of disproportionate reporting across medical dictionary for regulatory activity (MedDRA) hierarchy, namely from system organ class (SOC) to preferred term (PT) level. Results were prioritized using Bonferroni and focusing on Important Medical Events. Results: FAERS database contains 39,878 reports with an anti-CGRP listed among suspect drugs.

2517,"Introduction: Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody, Programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, currently approved for the treatment of a wide range of malignancies. This immunotherapy has a favorable efficacy/safety profile even though it could be related to very serious and sometimes fatal adverse events [1]. In particular, pembrolizumab use has been associated with several life-threatening immune-related adverse events. Among them, Myasthenia Gravis (MG) induced by pembrolizumab was rarely reported previously in the medical literature [2]. Objective: To present a clinical case report concerning a patient with possible pembolizumab-induced MG treated at our university hospital. Methods: Starting from a report of an adverse drug reaction (ADR) received by our Local Responsible for Pharmacovigilance (LRPV) and included in the National Pharmacovigilance Network, we retrospectively collected information about the drug therapy taken by the patient and his clinical history. Results: A 74-years-old Caucasian man with a diagnosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) since 2012, with more recent finding of additional pancreatic and pulmonary localizations, entered the emergency room in September 2021 with a suspected MG and deep bulbar involvement. Since July 2021, the patient has been treated according to the standard of care (SoC) with intravenous pembrolizumab and axitinib. Just a month later, he complained of general malaise, fatigue and a sense of heaviness in the neck with drooping of the head. The symptoms have worsened in dysphagia associated with marked dysarthria, hypophonia, difficulty in raising the upper limbs and walking. Episodes of diplopia were also reported. The clinical scenario suggests the indication for urgent hospitalization for appropriate clinical investigations. From the first results, a picture compatible with MG emerged. Immediately, the patient underwent appropriate treatment (such as intravenous immunoglobulins and high-dose corticosteroid therapy) followed by five consecutive plasmapheresis sessions.

2527,"Introduction: Disproportionality analyses aim to identify potential adverse drug reactions from spontaneous reporting systems in a timely and cost-effective manner. For their apparent simplicity, their use is rapidly expanding as a source of safety evidence complementary to clinical trials. In fact, most disproportions in reporting are not robust enough to identify a safety signal, and strategies used to assess robustness are heterogeneous and inconsistently used (1-4). Documenting these strategies would move forward harmonization in pharmacovigilance studies and simplify signals prioritization for regulatory interventions. Objective: To describe the approaches used in the last two decades to assess the robustness of disproportions. Methods: One hundred studies were randomly selected through a systematic literature search performed on Medline to identify all published disproportionality analyses since inception up to January 1, 2020 (search terms: ``case-non case'', ``disproportionality analysis'', ``pharmacovigilance analysis'', ``pharmacovigilance study''). We designed an extraction table to gather, for each article, general information, disproportionality techniques, other new clinical data, integration with other sources, and literature support (see Picture 1). A pilot analysis was performed to train 3 operators (MF, MI, ER). Disagreements were solved through discussion and consensus.",1.0,clinical,True
2528,"Results: This pilot study was based on 35 articles, of which 20% used more than 1 database, 26% employed a Bayesian method, and 54% used standardized or ad hoc queries for a more sensitive case retrieval. Techniques used to increase the robustness of the disproportionality were adjustment (29%), consistency on subpopulations (17%), positive and negative controls (26 and 20%), disproportionality time-trend (14%). Clinical elements of the reporting systems were investigated in a minority of studies: time to onset (34%), dose (14%), dechallenge/rechallenge (11%). Only 14% performed a causality assessment and 31% of the studies accounted for at least one bias (11% indication, 9% comedication, and 9% notoriety bias). Drug utilization data and systematic reviews were used to support robustness only in 1 study each. Most studies stemmed from regulatory reasons (51%) or case series (43%) as rationale. The main literature support presented in the discussion came from clinical trials (34%). Biological plausibility was discussed by 60% of the studies, but only 11% employed a dedicated pharmacokinetic-pharmacovigilance approach. Conclusion: We found a wide heterogeneity in the use of approaches to assess the robustness of disproportions.

2558,"cases meeting the diagnostic criteria of AP [4] and whose drug imputation was retained by the pharmacovigilance investigation evaluated according to the French method of Begaud et al [5]. Results: We collected 41 cases in which 48 drugs (33 active ingredients) were incriminated. The median age of the patients was 42.3 years (15 to 78 years). The sex ratio F/H was 1.05. The notifying physicians were gastrologists in 34% and surgeons in 27% of cases. Chronic pathologies were present in 37/41 patients where IBD represents 27% of cases. Scannographic stage was B in 27% of cases. Stages D and E were found in 27% of cases. The onset delay varied from one day to 12 years. In 46% of the cases, it was more than one month. Immunosuppressants, antihypertensive, and intestinal antiinflammatory drugs were incriminated in 12% of cases each, followed by glucocorticoids and antibiotics (10% of cases each). Among the immunosuppressants, azathioprine was found in 12% of cases. Among antihypertensive drugs, captopril was incriminated in 7% of cases. The drug-induced pancreatitis cases were mostly moderate with a favorable outcome after discontinuation of the drug in 98% of cases. Positive re-challenge occurred in one case with captopril. The imputation score was plausible (I2) in 51% of cases. Conclusion: Our study showed a predominance of DIAP in young adults with a slight female predominance. The delay of onset is essentially more than 1 month with a favorable evolution in almost all cases. The incriminated drugs belonged essentially to the classes of immunosuppressants, antihypertensives, and intestinal anti-inflammatories. Up-to-date knowledge of drugs that can cause PA can help clinicians be aware of this infrequent etiology and facilitate rapid discontinuation of the causative agent, thus reducing complications.

Methods: A retrospective study of adolescents with acute poisoning in 2016-2019 period hospitalized in the Regional Children's Clinical Hospital. The exclusion criterion was the presence of concomitant pathology. Statistical processing included evaluation of descriptive statistics parameters. Results: Use of various substances was widespread among the adolescents (n ,"" 57): psychoactive substances (61.4%), drug combinations (8.8%), antipsychotic (5.3%) and anxiolytic (5.3%) drugs, and other drugs (19.2%). For patients with acute poisoning with psychoactive substances the main syndromes were: impaired consciousness (96%), tachycardia (78%), psychomotor agitation and ataxia (70%), depression of consciousness (56%), miosis (45%), arterial hypertension (42%), mydriasis (30%), visual and auditory hallucinations, disorientation (25%). In 70% of cases it was not possible to determine the exact name of the substance that caused acute poisoning, the diagnosis was made according to the main clinical syndrome (toxidrome). The identification of the main syndromes: cholinergic, opioid, sympathomimic and anticholinergic allows to assume the toxic substance and choose an individual therapy scheme. Conclusion: The study revealed the need to develop a personalized approach for acute poisoning with psychoactive substances based on the main toxidrome to ensure prompt diagnosis and effective therapy.

2595,"Introduction: Patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) are more susceptible to adverse drug events (ADE) due to the severity of their illnesses, which often require administration of drugs with a high potential to cause harm [1,2]. The Global Trigger Tool (GTT) [3] is an efficient easy-to-use method to identify ADE and to measure their prevalence rates, and its implementation does not require high levels of technological or financial resources [4]. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of ADE in adult patients admitted to an ICU and assess the efficiency of defined triggers in detecting ADE. Methods: We performed a retrospective descriptive study based on the analysis of medical records of adult patients admitted to an ICU at Sumare¥ State Hospital--Brazil, for the period from January to December 2020. The GTT was adapted considering the reality of the study setting. Twenty-nine triggers were used, 15 of them were medication, 10 were abnormal laboratory results, and 4 related to care. The efficiency of the triggers was defined as the ability to identify an ADE, and its positive predictive value (PPV) calculated by the ratio between the number of ADE identified by a trigger and the number of trigger per medical record. The data will be presented under descriptive analysis of the absolute and percentage frequencies of the variables. Results: Of the 60 medical records reviewed, 37 had at least one ADE (62%). Fifty-seven ADE were identified, 43 of them (75%) due to established triggers. Only 5 ADE were detected using spontaneous reporting in the same period. A total of 447 triggers were identified. The most found triggers were: glucose \ 50 mg/dl (90.0/100 medical records), abrupt medication stop (70.0/100 medical records), and hydrocortisone (68.3/100 medical records). The most efficient triggers for ADE detection were INR [ 3 (PPV 70.9), abrupt medication stop (PPV 47.6), and platelets \ 50,000 (PPV 33.3). Conclusion: With the data collected so far, we were able to identify a number of ADE almost 10 times greater than the number reported in the same period via spontaneous notification. The results found show the efficiency of using GTT in the detection of ADE, which can contribute to optimizing the pharmacovigilance actions performed at the Sumare¥ State Hospital References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,positive,True

2607,"Introduction: The trafficking of falsified and substandard medicinal products is a global socio-economic problem, which poses a serious threat to economy and health of populations of most countries [1]. World Health Organization (WHO) press department issued a press release with the bold headline: ``1 in 10 medical products in developing countries is substandard or falsified'' [2]. Objective: Detection of the unusual appearance of monitored ADRs. Methods: A cluster of 8 reports for Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) have been received by the pharmacovigilance department at the Medical Union Pharmaceuticals co (MUP) regarding its products, Unictam “ 1500 mg (Ampicillin/Sulbactam). Shortly after, more 3 similar cases have been received. The reported ADRs were uncommonly to be related to Ampicillin/Sulbactam, not to mention the sudden trending in their reporting. At this stage, an underlying counterfeit had been suspected by the company's pharmacovigilance department. In a timely manner, serious cases were notified to the regulatory authority with a highlight of potential counterfeit. Meanwhile, a multidisciplinary investigation has been initiated within the company including; analysis of product's collected samples from the cases' reporters, in-depth literature review about the suspected product in relation to the reported ADRs, more active social media screening to capture any similar posted cases, establishing published electronic-based product questionnaire for healthcare professionals and the public to support data collection. Results: Visual inspection of the samples showed differences compared to the original pack of Unictam “ 1500 mg in the outer pack, powder color, flowability and quantity. Samples analysis has confirmed a product counterfeit. During the period February to April 2022, a total of 48 cases were collected for this product compared to 0 and 3 reports in 2021 and 2020 respectively. Which represent a noted trend attributed to the product counterfeit. 59% of the reported cases for this counterfeit product were serious. The reported ADRs which were characterized as important and cannot be explained by the product pharmacology included; Blood pressure increased, Syncope, Mydriasis, Vomiting blood, EGC signs of Myocardial infarction and Myocardial infarction. Other reported expected ADRs included Anaphylaxis, Vomiting and hypotension. Conclusion: Counterfeit products can be detected from cases initially reported as ADRs. An effective Pharmacovigilance system at pharmaceutical companies can play an important role in detecting and investigating such counterfeit, in particular, those associated with ADRs. Companies seeking such responsibilities attain public trust in the company as a whole. References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,cluster,True

2625,"Introduction: Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Oxford/AstraZeneca (chAdOx1-S) COVID-19 vaccines were approved for emergency use. Clinical trials of both vaccines reported no safety concerns other than a few local and systemic reactions that resolved in few days for both vaccines. Cutaneous reactions to COVID-19 vaccination are generally minor and self-limited. The most common cutaneous reaction reported was a local injection-site reaction. Objective: Here we present 3 cases of erythema multiform following COVID-19 vaccination with positive rechallenge in 2 cases. Methods: Not applicable. Results: Case 1: A 51 year old woman with no past medical history presented with a macular, erythematous, round-shaped itchy rash on the hands, knees and soles. She denied having a neither recent illness nor sick contact. However, she received the first dose of the mRNA Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2), 3 days earlier. Lesions disappeared in 7 days with local corticosteroid treatment. One month later and two days after receiving the second shot of the same vaccine, lesions reappeared and extended to upper members. Skin biopsy was compatible with erythema polymorph. Case 2: A 55 year old man with a past medical history of hypertension, presented 6 days following the 2nd shot of the mRNA Pfizer/ BioNTech (BNT162b2), vesicular eruptions on the upper and lower members. The outcome was favorable within 2 weeks under local corticosteroid. The patient reported that he had the same skin lesions in ankles and soles few days following the 1st shot of the same vaccine. Histological findings revealed an erythema polymorph. Case 3: A 57 year old woman with a medical history of hypertension and anxiety disorder presented with a worsening rash and fever for 6 days. The patient reported that she experienced fever, polyarthralgia and that she had received the second shot of Oxford/AstraZeneca (chAdOx1-S), the day before these symptoms appeared. On the physical examination, she had targetoid skin lesions over the trunk, on the ear, upper and lower members. Otherwise she had oral and genital mucosal ulcerations. A thoracic CT scan was performed because of the persistent fever and showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes, a layer of pericardial and plural effusion.",1.0,COVID-19,True
2626,A favorable outcome was observed in 3 weeks. Conclusion: Erythema multiform remains an exceptional COVID 19 vaccine adverse effect. Health care workers must be aware of this potential adverse effect or its recurrence and advise patients accordingly. Benefits of receiving a COVID 19 vaccine remains more important.

2650,"Introduction: Frailty is a geriatric syndrome associated with decreased physiological systems, increased vulnerability to adverse drug effects, and unfavorable clinical outcomes (1). Medication management in patients with frailty remains an understudied challenge (2). Existing clinical guidelines rarely provide interventions specific to frail people with multiple co-morbidities and treatments (3). Deprescribing, a process of dose reduction or withdrawal of inappropriate medication that no longer has benefit, is a proposed intervention in the care of older adults living with frailty (4,5). Objective: To evaluate safety, clinical impact, and long-term outcomes of deprescribing services in frail patients, including the barriers and enablers of deprescribing services in such settings. Methods: A systematic review was performed in Scopus, CINAHL PLUS (EBSCO), MEDLINE (OVID and EMBASE) and Cochrane library. Interventional studies with any design about deprescribing services in frail patients were included. Search terms included deprescribing, frailty, safety, and efficacy. The Mixed Methods Appraisal tool (MMAT) was used for appraising the methodological quality of the included papers (6). Studies were selected after title, abstract, and full text screening, with independent review. Data",1.0,clinical,True
2651,"extraction for the selected studies included study aims, setting, location, study design, duration, participants, sample size, methods of frailty assessment, method of analysis, results, description of deprescribing services, and gaps of deprescribing interventions. Thematic analysis was used for analysing data from the selected articles. Results: 590 unique titles were identified, with 9 (6 trials, 1 interview, 1 survey, and 1 designed-delay study) meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria. Five main descriptive themes have been identified: barriers, enablers, deprescribing services in frailty, safety management and deprescribing outcomes. Conclusion: This systematic review provides limited evidence that deprescribing services in frail patients are effective in reducing the number of potentially inappropriate medications and medication costs. A full understanding of frailty, barriers, enablers, and deprescribing long-term outcomes are critical to improve medication safety. To further improve deprescribing in frailty, clinicians should consider a customised safety plan and benefit/risk assessment for each patient. High-quality clinical trials with larger sample size and longer duration are needed to demonstrate the safety and long-term effectiveness of deprescribing in frail people.

Objective: To investigate whether an EHR-based data network can be used in PV investigations to calculate background rates of anemia in NSCLC patients. Methods: Using the TriNetX Dataworks USA EHR Network, the rate of anemia was assessed among patients with NSCLC between 2018 and 2020 using ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes and laboratory values for hemoglobin (Hgb). Any occurrence of anemia within one year after NSCLC diagnosis was included. NSCLC was defined using ICD-10CM diagnosis code C34 (Malignant neoplasm of bronchus and lung) and North American Association of Central Cancer Registries ICD-O morphology code 8046 for non-small cell carcinoma [2]. Anemia was assessed based on laboratory results by severity grade using definitions from CTCAE version 5.0, as follows: Grade (G)1, \ LLN to 10.0 g/dL; G2, \ 10.0 to B 8.0 g/dL; G3, \ 8.0 g/dL [3]. The Hgb lower limit of normal (LLN) was set as 13.8 g/dL for males and 11.3 g/dL for females [4]. G3 was also evaluated by assessing patients that received packed red cells or whole blood transfusion procedures. Results: 15,727 newly diagnosed NSCLC patients were identified between 2018 and 2020. Of those patients, 3,238 (20.6%) experienced anemia in the year following diagnosis based on anemia diagnosis codes and 8,689 (55.2%) experienced anemia based on CTCAE G1G3 [G1: 7,545 patients (48.0%); G2: 4,804 (30.5%); G3: 2,528 (16.1%)]. Conclusion: Real-World background rates of anemia in NSCLC, including G1, 2, and 3, based on laboratory findings and transfusion data, were calculated using the TriNetX EHR querying platform. This type of real-time interactive querying tool combined with deep clinical data can be effectively utilized by pharmacovigilance teams to quickly assess background rates to compare to observed potential signals seen with drug-event pairs in the clinical trial or post-market reporting.",1.0,clinical,True

2674,"Introduction: Atypical antipsychotics are increasingly prescribed because their relative reduced extrapyramidal adverse effects (AE). Risperidone (RSP) is an atypical antipsychotic that has a strong affinity to serotonin type-2 (5-HT2A), dopamine D2, a1-and a2adrenergic, and histamine H1 receptors causing antagonism at these receptors [1]. It has proven to be effective in several psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders and childhood and adolescence behavioural disorders [2]. Weight gain and sedation are among the most commonly reported AE with this drug [3]. However localised edema is uncommon with RSP. Objective: To report a rarely AE with RSP. Methods: These cases were notified in the Tunisian National Centre of Pharmacovigilance and were evaluated according to the updated French method of imputability [4]. Results: Case reports: Case 1: A 14-year-old teenager started a treatment with RSP (2 mg/day) and lorazepam (2 mg/day) for behavioral disorders since March 2019. Two months later, she developed an edema in the lower limbs which has been gradually progressive since then. Physical examination excluded any other pathology and laboratory tests were normal. RSP treatment was stopped and the edema gradually regressed. Case 2: A 23-year-old woman, with past medical history of schizophrenia, was initiated on RSP (2 mg/day) and lorazepam (1.25 mg/day) since January 2022. After 45 days'follow-up, she presented a facial edema that led her to voluntarily interrupt her treatment. The swelling resolved completely 5 days after the drug withdrawal. In both cases, the role of lorazepam in inducing the edema was ruled out since its resumption without incident. Conclusion: Edema associated with RSP, is a rare but increasingly reported AE. Many theories have been suggested to explain the mechanism by which RSP lead to edema. Also available data suggest that this AE may be dose-dependent and can occur at any time during therapy [5].

Objective: To quantify disproportionate reporting (Disp-Rep) (2-4) for the risk of drug-associated MG for 29 clinically approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in 2 groups: (1) Anti-angiogenic (AA) TKIs (14 drugs); (2) Non-anti-angiogenic (NAA) TKIs (15 drugs). Methods: We used the AERS and VigiBase databases, with data up to Dec 2020 and Mar 2021 for analysis respectively.

2714,"Introduction: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a rare disorder of coagulation with different etiologies, including treatments with drug [1]. On December 2020, during a scheduled periodic assessment meeting, the Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco (AIFA) evaluated four individual case safety reports (ICSRs) reporting obinutuzumab and non-overt DIC [2] as new possible signal. Objective: We reported the process of signal detection for obinutuzumab-associated non-overt DIC. Methods: Periodic assessments of signal detection for drugs are conducted by AIFA in collaboration with the Italian Regional Centers of Pharmacovigilance. Reporting odds ratio (ROR) is calculated for each drug-event pair as measure of disproportionality. A signal is generated when the number of ICSRs is C 3 and the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of ROR is C 1. Priority is given to unexpected and important medical events. Possible signals are presented and discussed in the light of information reported in medical literature. Eudravigilance is also checked for similar ICSRs. When a signal is considered enough robust, an assessment report is submitted to the rapporteur country for a possible evaluation by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) at the European Medicine Agency. Results: During routine signal evaluation meetings in December 2020, 4 cases of obinutuzumab-associated non-overt DIC meet the criteria for signal definition (ROR 213.6 and IC025 77). At that time, the Italian database of ICSRs, contained about 150.000 ICSRs. The patients (2 men and 2 women, age 67-77) received obinutuzumab for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Patients received drug for the treatment of age-related diseases. A subclinical DIC was detected within 48 hours from obinutuzumab administration. After the exclusion of alternative causes, the hematologists decided to report all the 4 cases as suspected adverse drug reactions to obinutuzumab. The DIC spontaneously resolved in all cases. Three more ICRSs were reported in Eudravigilance database. Medical literature reported only one case-",1.0,case,True
2715,"report on a woman who developed a DIC following obinutuzumab administration was published [3]. Other authors showed that the administration of the drug induced a pro-inflammatory response with the increase of interleukins and tumor necrosis factor [4, 5]. The DIC is a rare adverse reaction also for rituximab, another anti-CD20 and a rare class effect cannot be excluded [3]. The evidence was robust enough to present the signal to the PRAC. Conclusion: The PRAC identified non-overt DIC as an uncommon adverse reaction to obinutuzumab, and recommended to update the summary of product characteristics (SPC) of obinutuzumab.

2741,"Introduction: Fenofibrate may cause adverse skin reactions, such as photosensitivity. Sun protection measures are generally sufficient to reduce it, especially if it is a phototoxicity reaction. However, in certain situations, the only way to reduce symptoms, is to stop the causative drug. Objective: We report a case of photoallergic eczema caused by fenofibrate with regression only upon treatment withdrawal. Methods: This case was notified to the National Center of Pharmacovigilance and was analyzed according to the Naranjo causality scale method [1]. Results: A 66-year-old woman was put on glicazide for type 2 diabetes, ibesartan-hydrochlorothiazide for arterial hypertension and fenofibrate 160 mg for hypertriglyceridemia. Two months after the start of this last, she presented with edematous erythema of the forehead and the back of the hands, concomitant with prolonged sun exposure. Despite several cutaneous topicals and physical sun protection measures, there was an exacerbation of the edema and appearance of vesicular elements. The diagnosis of photoallergic eczema was made and discontinuation of fenofibrate was recommended. The symptoms regressed then, in 10 days. Conclusion: Drug photosensitivity, a trivialized and under-reported drug event, can be serious and even life-threatening. This risk is all the more important in sunny areas, such as African continent, where physical sun protection measures, seem ineffective and only stopping the causative drug improves the symptomatology. Hence the importance of making practitioners aware of this adverse event induced by fenofibrate. References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,case,True

2757,"Introduction: Off-label drugs can be an alternative clinical tool to authorised therapies that have failed. However, their use raises several concerns about efficacy and patients' safety due to the lack of highlevel clinical evidence [1]. More information is therefore needed to assess if such treatments are related to an increased risk for patients to develop adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Objective: To analyse the frequency of ADRs after off-label drugs use in a cancer patients' cohort and to compare it to ADRs reported in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of the administered medicines. Methods: performed a retrospective observational study of the ADRs reported by clinicians in the electronic health records of adult patients undergoing an off-label treatment at the Istituto Oncologico Veneto in Padua, Italy. The study period was from January 1st, 2014 to August 31st, 2021. After having collected ADRs, we evaluated their severity according to the CTCAE [2]. In the end, a comparison between these results and the ADRs reported in the SmPC was carried out. Results: 310 Patients (183 M) were considered, with 37 different offlabel treatments. The median age was 60 years and ECOG/status 0-1 were mostly registered. In 165 patients were reported 423 ADRs, of which 43 (10.2%) were classified G3 and only 3 (0.7%) were classified G4. Moreover, 98 (23%) of them were classified as Important Medical Events, mainly thrombocytopenia (n ,"" 28), neutropenia (n "", 23) and hyperbilirubinemia (n ,"" 14). The comparison between the obtained ADRs and those reported in the SmPC proved that only 17 (4.0%) of them were absent and 387 (91. 5%) were classified as very common or common ADRs. Considering the most used drug regorafenib (a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor or TKI), a comparative analysis between the type and frequency of ADRs found in this study and similar ADRs reported in the SmPC was also performed. A minor percentage of ADRs in the patients of this observational study was reported.

2765,"Introduction: Psoriasis is an erythematous dermatosis with unclear etiology. Several drugs such as lithium, beta-blockers, adrenergic antagonists, and interferons can aggravate pre-existing psoriasis or cause de novo psoriasis. Few cases of psoriasis were described with interferon-b. Objective: Herein we report a case of interferon-b induced nummular psoriasis occurring in a multiple sclerosis patient with positive rechallenge. Methods: This case was reported in August 2020 and evaluated according to the French imputation method of causality assessment. Results: A 39-year-female patient with no medical history of psoriasis has started interferon beta 1b for her multiple sclerosis. After one month, she presented general erythroderma and secondary diffuse erythemato-squamous coin-sized lesions evocative of nummular psoriasis. The evolution was favorable 20 days after drug withdrawal and with symptomatic treatment. This same symptomatology recurred one month after the rechallenge. We suspected that interferon was the causative agent in the induction of psoriasis. Conclusion: The imputation score was likely (I3) due to the evocative delay (30 days) of psoriasis occurrence, the favorable outcome after drug withdrawal, and the positive rechallenge. Activation of psoriasis is an uncommon side effect of drugs and could mimic other cutaneous diseases in its rare features that need careful evaluation of an added morbidity.

2772,"Introduction: Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic and a spasmolytic drug used as a therapeutic option in patients with overactive detrusor function-either idiopathic detrusor instability or detrusor hyperreflexia. The most common ocular side effects of oxybutynin include reduced lacrimation and cycloplegia. Blindness has exceptionally been reported with this drug (1). Objective: Herein, we report an exceptional case of sudden onset of bilateral blindness in a child following oxybutynin prescription. Methods: This case was notified in April 2022 to the National Centre of Pharmacovigilance and evaluated according to the updated French method of causality assessment. Results: A 5-year-old female child with a past medical history of Asthma since the age of 8 months treated with cortis and aerol and of a recurrent urinary tract infection since the age of 4years, started oxybutynin for an overactive detrusor function. One month later, she complained of blurry vision. The evolution was marked by the rapidly progressive aggravation of the symptomatology leading the parents to consult. An examination revealed decrease in visual acuity limited to seeing the hand move with anormal fundus and a normal ocular tone. The brain CT scan and the magnetic resonance revealed no abnormalities and the EPI showed an axonal left optic neuropathy. Serology test for EBV, HIV, CMV, HBV, HCV, mump virus, adenovirus and measles virus were also negative. The evolution was marked by the persistence of the ocular symptoms one month after drug withdrawl. We suspected that oxybutynin was the causative agent in induction of blindness with an imputation score of I2 mainly because of the negative investigations and the compatible delay of occurrence after the drug intake. Conclusion: The mechanism involved would be an inhibition of the M3 receptor which is located on the ciliary body, the iris sphincter muscles and the lacrimal gland. When this receptor is blocked, a cascade of blurred vision occurs due to mild mydriasis, cycloplegia and/or dryness of the ocular surface. This effect tends to occur for high initial doses of oxybutynin (C 10 mg) (1). References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,case,True

2779,"Introduction: In Lombardy and Piedmont (Northern Italy, about 14 million people) the GRESIF pharmacovigilance network project, aimed to collect, assess, treat and prevent severe systemic drug reactions was activated in 2021, supported by the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). GRESIF involves regional and hospital pharmacovigilance centers, and several hospital wards: burn, dermatology, allergology, internal medicine, infectivology and intensive care departments. The registry collects in the National Pharmacovigilance Network all reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) concerning Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP). Objective: The specific objectives of the study are to early detect severe systemic ADRs, evaluate their incidence, morbidity and mortality rates, focus on new generation drugs such as RNA antivirals and oncological drugs, implement and optimize guidelines, manage long-term sequelae by follow-up and create a consultable web-based database. Methods: We have drawn up the guidelines [1,2], through a multidisciplinary approach in order to improve the management of very complex patients even in facilities that are not habitually involved in the treatment of these pathologies. This document aims to support professionals in standardizing diagnostic criteria and methods of therapeutic approach. It's useful to inform the general practitioner about responsible drugs and give some information about risk /benefit on the riexposure. Results: In 2021, 27 cases of SJS/TEN, 18 cases of DRESS and no cases of AGEP were collected. There is a female prevalence (25 cases out 44); the age range is from 20 to 93 years. The median age of patients in Lombardy and in Piedmont is respectively 55 and 66 for females, 47 and 63 for males. The total mortality for cases of SJS/ TEN is about 19% and for DRESS we have no deaths. More frequent suspected drugs are antibiotics, followed by allopurinol and anticonvulsants. Noteworthy is the presence of 4 cases of severe ADR related to anti Covid19 RNA vaccines. In all cases, according to the guidelines, the timely discontinuation of the responsible drug was fundamental as the general management. Furthermore we started a study for the HLA typing of these patients. We enrolled 18 cases and the results showed that 6 patients who received allopurinol were all positive to HLA B 58:01. Conclusion: Despite being extremely rare but serious reactions, the absolute need to implement shared diagnostic and therapeutic protocols to be applied promptly is highlighted, in order to reduce both patient mortality and long-term sequelae.

2797,"Introduction: Carbamazepine is the drug of choice for the treatment of focal epilepsy. Despite its widely proven efficacy, its use can be complicated with severe and life-threatening adverse drug reactions up to 10% (1). Besides, carbamazepine is also subject to interactions changing its serum concentration and exposing the patient to the risk of toxicity or inefficacy Objective: To describe a case of concomitant use of carbamazepine and acetazolamide, with a highly relevant interaction that requires attention. Methods: This is a 27-year-old male with a past history of facial traumatism, complicated with osteomeningeal breach for which he was treated with acetazolamide. He was hospitalized for a five-day history of vomiting, rhinorrhea, and neck pain. On admission, physical findings were limited to positive Kernig or Brudzinski signs. The patient's Laboratory data indicated a biological inflammatory syndrome. A lumbar puncture revealed a colourless cerebrospinal fluid with a normal cell. With a diagnosis of aseptic cerebral meningitis, and taking into consideration the high risk of contracting Streptococcus pneumonia with his prior head injury, cefotaxime (2g 9 6/day) was initiated as a prophylactic treatment. Unfortunately, the patient developed a focal seizure. Laboratory investigation ruled out any metabolic disorder and neuroimaging were normal. Carbamazepine, then, was started at 200 mg twice a day in addition to ongoing cefotaxime and acetazolamide. Routine check-up analysis objected,5 days later, severe hepatic cytolysis (ASAT , 11 ULN and ALAT ,"" 22ULN), was associated with a normal prothrombin index. Systemic research of classical causes of acute hepatitis was performed: The patient denied any use of alcohol and Viral serologies for hepatitis A, B, C, E, CMV, and EBV were negative, serology for Epstein-Barr virus revealed signs of past infection, autoimmune serological antibodies and liver biopsy were not performed. An abdominal ultrasound examination showed an intact liver and a normal-sized spleen. Carbamazepine was immediately discontinued. ASAT and ALAT levels decrease 3 days after the discontinuation of carbamazepine achieving 3ULN and 7ULN, respectively and total recovery of perturbed hepatic enzymes was obtained 20 days later. Results: With a score of 6, this interaction is `probably' the cause of this liver injury (2). Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor may increase the serum concentration and the risk of toxicity of carbamazepine. Hepatoxicity related to carbamazepine, ranging from a benign increase of liver enzymes to rare cases of hepatic failure has been reported and is usually reversible with stopping treatment. Conclusion: We hypothesize that concomitant use of acetazolamide increases carbamazepine serum level. References/Further Sources of Information""",1.0,case,True

2805,"Introduction: The dispersion of chemicals in water ecosystems nowadays is a serious threat to wildlife animals, plants and can cause damage also to humans. Studies confirmed the presence of pharmaceuticals, namely NSAIDs and hormones, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and pesticides in small amounts in a wide variety of ecosystems, including rivers, lakes, and seas. As regards the pharmaceuticals class, NSAIDs and hormones have been detected in concentrations ranging from ng/L to lg/L [1]. Exposure to these compounds could damage the central nervous system, altering behavior and cognitive capacities. Among NSAIDs, ibuprofen and diclofenac were proven to be the most harmful for freshwater fish, also acting in a concerted fashion [2]. As for the hormones, 17-alphaethinylestradiol and 17-beta-estradiol are the ones most present in the environment and contributed [ 97% to the total potential estrogenicity of the waters of Venice lagoon [3]. Many studies investigated the occurrence of human pharmaceuticals in the environment [4], although very limited knowledge is available on the effects of those drugs on non-target organisms (polychaetes, crustaceans, mollusks, fish, and others) in the aquatic environment [5]. Objective: Evaluate the neurodegenerative effects that the chronic exposure of adult zebrafish to diclofenac, ibuprofen, 17-alphaethinylestradiol, and 17-beta-estradiol at levels encountered in the environment. Methods: Animals are exposed for four weeks to 4 ascending concentrations of each pharmaceutical. Behavioral trials are carried out before and after the treatment. Novel tank test is performed to evaluate anxiety-like, stress and locomotion parameters, T-maze for assessing damages in spatial memory and olfactory preference test for the recognition of the insurgence of anosmia--i.e. the impairment of the sense of smell. Immediately after these trials, fishes are euthanized and included in paraffin. Immunohistochemistry studies are focused on the detection of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), markers of dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. TH? and ChAT? neurons are expected to be reduced by the treatment. Results: Ongoing studies prove that chronic exposure to diclofenac, ibuprofen, 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol, and 17-beta-estradiol alter cognitive and motor performance in line with neuroanatomical rearrangement.

2816,"Introduction: An inter-disciplinary `one health' effort is required to contain antibiotic resistance. Surveillance is a key tool in containing ABR [1], and there has been considerable progress, but gaps remain [2]. International pharmacovigilance databases may be a useful tool in antibiotic resistance surveillance, particularly where laboratory capacity is limited [3]. Objective: This project aims to explore the current use and possible areas of improvement of pharmacovigilance systems as a source of surveillance of antibiotic resistance from a `one-health' perspective. Methods: The project comprises of three sub-studies, all of which will focus on the `one health' aspect of ABR through describing human, animal, and environmental health. The first sub-study will describe international pharmacovigilance databases and how antibiotic resistance is reported within in these databases. Thus far, the planned databases for inclusion are VigiBase, the WHO global database of reported potential side effects of medicinal products, and Veterinary EudraVigilance, which is maintained by the European Medicines Agency. While no suitable international eco-pharmacovigilance database has been identified so far, efforts will be made to highlight the relevant reports within the other databases. The primary outcome will be the case characteristics of reports identified using ``ATC:J01-Antibacterials for systemic use'' and an adapted MedDRA SMQ ``Lack of efficacy/effect'' and the VeDDRA equivalent. The second sub-study will use similar methodology and databases but compare this reporting to that of specialised antibiotic resistance databases, with a focus on geographic distribution.

2820,"study will be a mixed-methods follow-up cross-sectional survey that follows focus group discussions of pharmacovigilance experts to establish attitudes to the reporting of ABR in pharmacovigilance and to explore the possibilities to improve reporting. Results: As of 03/05/22 there are 22,853 reports in VigiBase for ``ATC:J01--Antibacterials for systemic use'', in combination with the SMQ ``Lack of efficacy/effect''. The number of reports and other baseline characteristics are not yet available for the other databases. Conclusion: This project has the potential to increase the knowledge of how international pharmacovigilance systems can be beneficial to ABR surveillance. There is potential for the project to highlight areas of benefit from expanding or improving current pharmacovigilance practices in general, but it can also highlight the valuable information within pre-existing databases and how utilisation of the current systems can benefit those working within containment of global AMR.

2827,"Introduction: Human milk is considered the ideal nutrition for infants. Despite the increased attention for breastfeeding, information about drug use by breastfeeding women is scarce [1-2]. Objective: to evaluate the prevalence of medications use while breastfeeding and the associated factors. Methods: Women who gave birth at the study hospital and stayed with their newborns were asked to participate in a structured interview. The questions included social status, health problems, breastfeeding status, prescribed medications, personal attitude to medications use during breastfeeding and related informational sources. Results: By the time of the analysis 50 questionnaires were evaluated. Forty eight women had babies younger than 1 month. Mean age was 32±5 years (17 to 44). 37 (74%) had higher education. Three women were not breastfeeding due to the medications: cyclosporine, antithymocyte globulin; amitriptyline, chlorprothixene, sulpiride; ciprofloxacin. Among those breastfeeding the prevalence of medications use was 76%; 15 women (30%) received 1 medication; 23 (46%)--2 to 7 medications. These were: oxytocin (11 (22%)); heparins (9 (18%)); ferrous preparations (8 (16%)); vaginal antiinfectives (8 (16%)); methyldopa (7 (14%)); antibiotics (6 (12%)); warfarin, ketoprofen, nifedipine, perindopril, torasemide, spironolactone, herbal urinary antiseptic, sotalol and metoprolol were used by 1 woman each.",1.0,social,True
2828,"Thirty-six (72%) women considered breastfeeding necessary for the baby; seven (14%) believed it can easily be stopped. All women agreed that there are safe medications during breastfeeding while three of them believed the medications shouldn't be used; 31 women (62%) stated that even doctors don't know if it is safe to take medications while breastfeeding. The respondents told they would receive information from doctors (23-46%); Internet (11-22%); other women (10-20%); pharmacist (2-4%); family members (2-4%); professional associations (2-4%); 43 (86%) women reported that they can't get information about medications safety in breastfeeding. Conclusion: During the early postpartum period, almost all women in our cohort were breastfeeding. No unnecessary interruption due to the medications was noted. 14% of the women were negative towards breastfeeding in general, but not due to possible need for medications. Despite general readiness to use medications while breastfeeding, most women noted lack of information about their safety, and less than half of them showed trust in doctor's advice. Although our cohort may not represent the general population, the results highlight high prevalence of medications use during breastfeeding and the clear lack of safety information.

Methods: A retrospective, case-control study was carried out using the electronic database of OB/GYN Hospital ``Dr. Shterev'', Sofia, Bulgaria. We analyzed the medical records of 110 women diagnosed with GDM, who gave birth in the period between January 2017- January 2019. Patients were divided into two groups, depending on the treatment plan--metformin group (n , 70) and insulin group (n ,"" 40). We compared maternal characteristics, including fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), measured at diagnosis of GDM, and at the end of pregnancy. A comparative analysis of the maternal and neonatal outcomes between the two groups was also performed. Results: The mean FPG levels at diagnosis of GDM were significantly lower in the metformin-treated group compared to women receiving insulin therapy (5.72 vs. 6.69 mmol/L, p \ 0.001). The same results were found when the baseline HbA1c levels were compared (5.61% vs. 6.29%, p \ 0.001). There was no difference between the metformin-treated group and the insulin-treated group regarding the mode of conception, mode of delivery, gestational weeks at delivery, and incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia. The neonates of the mothers treated with metformin were with significantly lower mean birthweight comparing those in the insulin group (3154 vs. 3421 g, p "", 0.03). The incidence of macrosomia was higher in the insulin group than in the metformin group (p \ 0.01). There were no differences between the groups regarding Apgar scores and small-for-gestational-age neonates. Conclusion: The results of this retrospective study suggest that metformin could be a safe and effective alternative to insulin in the treatment of GDM. No short-term complications have been observed in neonates born from women treated with metformin. References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,case,True

[2, 3] In addition, this may raise questions about the safety of commonly used medications during breastfeeding. Objective: To assess Bulgarian breastfeeding women's knowledge and experience regarding spontaneous reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Methods: A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was performed between June 2021 and September 2021. A pre-validated, anonymous questionnaire was distributed among breastfeeding women using a web-based platform. Data on demographics of participants, knowledge, and factors that may influence spontaneous reporting of ADRs were collected. Descriptive statistics and a chisquare test were used to analyze the data. Results: A total of 96 breastfeeding women completed the survey. The overall mean age was 29.3 years ranging from 24 to 43. The majority of breastfeeding women reported a lack of knowledge regarding the ADRs reporting process. Only 25% of survey participants were aware of the possibility of reporting ADRs directly to the Bulgarian Drug Agency and this was significantly associated with education level (P\0.001). ADRs reporting rate during breastfeeding was poor (12.5%.) For the majority of women, the primary source of information about drug safety during breastfeeding were the health care professionals (92.7%) followed by a package leaflet (53.1%) and social media, e.g., discussion forums (47.9%). The majority of surveyed women (84.4%) reported the need for additional information on drug safety during breastfeeding. Conclusion: The results from this suggest that Bulgarian breastfeeding women have insufficient knowledge regarding spontaneous ADRs reporting. Educational campaigns and additional information are needed to increase breastfeeding women's awareness of drug safety, self-medication and the ADRs reporting process.

It is extensively metabolized by the liver and no signal of hepatotoxicity was identified before marketing authorization (MA).

2860,"Methods: We conducted a retrospective search of EudraVigilance using 27 preferred terms (PT) associated with DILI in two time frames: from MA of ulipristal in February 2012 up to September 2017, when the safety issue was raised, and from that point up until 31/12/2021. In the analysis of the first time frame, for those which fulfilled biochemical criteria for DILI, we used the RUCAM score (2) for causality assessment. Results: We found 24 individual case safety reports (ICSR) with DILI related PT, with 7 of them including either the PT ``drug-induced liver injury'' or ``hepatotoxicity''. Of these 24 ICSR, 4 did not have enough data to assess criteria fulfillment, 7 did not fulfill biochemical criteria. From the remaining 13 ICSR, 3 corresponded to the transplants. Of these 10 remaining ICSR, 2 had a RUCAM score of, at least, ``Possible'' and other 2 were auto-immune hepatitis but had no information regarding corticosteroid therapy or tapering. In the second time frame, after the safety issue was raised, we found 449 ISCR which included PT associated with DILI and 13 including either the PT ``drug-induced liver injury'' or ``hepatotoxicity''. Conclusion: Medicines such as ulipristal, metabolized by the liver, require careful monitoring for DILI. The use of DILI related terms can be used as sentinel in the attempt of anticipating possible liver injury. In this research we found that there are not many therapeutic options for patients with uterine fibroids who cannot undergo surgery or embolization. Regardless of RMM, this work highlights the need for safer treatment alternatives for patients with uterine fibroids. References/Further Sources of Information 1.

It has been also suggested that people treated with SSRI are at an increased risk of ischemic stroke and having a stroke with unfavorable outcomes [3]. Objective: To investigate sex differences in the incidence of stroke and SSRI use. Methods: A retrospective case-non-case observational study of ADRs reported to the World Health Organization Vigibase database from March 1988 to March 2022. Cases were defined as all ``Central nervous system hemorrhages and cerebrovascular conditions'' using the Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ), while all other severe ADRs were included as non-cases. Cases were then divided into ischemic or hemorrhagic cerebrovascular conditions. Studied drugs were: citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine. Age-adjusted reporting odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (aROR, 95% CI) were calculated for each condition and sex, and ratios of aROR (RROR) were used for investigating gender differences in stroke incidence related to SSRI use. I2 and Cochran Q were used to investigate the heterogeneity between drugs aROR and RROR.

2884,"Introduction: Infertility can be nominated as the modern ``beast of burden'' of the 21st century. Between 50 and 70 million couples1 worldwide suffer from inability to conceive, with a steady trend in increasing the number of newly diagnosed cases of sterility. Yet patient engagement in pharmacovigilance surveillance systems still needs to be fully explored.2 Objective: The current study aims to evaluate the type, incidence and severity of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Patients' awareness of the System for spontaneous reporting of ADRs has been tested. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study, based on results generated through a direct interview with 659 patients for a study period of 14 months. Statistical analysis of data, generated by the completion of a validated questionnaire has been performed. The following statistical analyses have been applied: Pearson's chi-square analysis (when investigating relationships between descriptive data with two or more categories), Student's T-test (for comparison of two groups of observations), Mann-Whitney test (to compare quantitative variables between two groups) and Kruskal-Wallis test (for quantitative analysis of variables among three different groups. Results: Almost 40 % of participants reported a suspected ADR as a consequence of stimulation hormone application. The mean number of reported ADRs per patient is 1.27. As far as patients who reported an ADR are concerned, 213 respondents (82.2%) have indicated a direct causal relationship between the application of a particular stimulation preparation and a specific adverse effect. In 90% of cases of an experienced ADR, participants would evaluate the adverse effect as mild. Suspected ADRs have led to therapy termination in 3.8 % of investigated cases in the study. More than 2/3 of experienced ADRs are associated with local injection site reaction (63.1%), followed by reports of headache (9.8%), gastro-intestinal discomfort (5.8%) and nausea (4.7%). Women who underwent therapy for assisted reproduction are not well aware of the functional principles of the System for spontaneous ADR reporting and are not motivated enough to directly report a suspected ADR.

2894,"Introduction: The quality of herbal medicines (HM) is one of the main challenges to the pharmacovigilance of HM [1]. The best example is the substitution of the target or marked species by another species and the addition of species along with the target or marked species [2]. These substitutions and additions are driven by the growing demand for herbs and the limited supply of many wildharvested species [3]. When the demand for a specific herb exceeds the supply, there is an increased likelihood that adulterants or poor quality material will be used [4]. Recent developments in the molecular identification of plants using DNA sequence data allow accurate identification of plant species from medicinal plants using defined DNA markers [5]. Identification of multiple constituent species of compounded medicinal plant products using an amplicon metabarcode allows verification of labeled ingredients and detection of substituted, adulterated, and added species [6]. Objective: To investigate and detect the substitution on the market of several samples of Crocus sativus L. available on the Moroccan market. Methods: A molecular and bioinformatics study was carried out to differentiate 7 saffron (Crocus sativus L.) samples collected in 7 different cities in Morocco and to assess their authenticity using DNA barcoding. Three candidate markers were amplified using genomic DNA and gene sequencing of these markers. Results: The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of samples using the three primers gave promising results. They were able to distinguish different accessions from analyzed samples. In all the phylogenetic trees, four samples were clearly grouped in a clade with high bootstrap values while the samples from three cities were classified in another distinct clade and these have been identified as containing non-authentic Crocus sativus L. and all of them were positive for Carthamus. Conclusion: Non-authentic products may cause potential risks to consumers, induce adverse reactions, and further reduce the apparent effectiveness of saffron as an herbal remedy or spice.

Thus, they are widely used as food supplements to prevent various ailments in both adults and children [1,3,4]. Beehive products are characterized by a highly variable composition, depending on honeybee and botanical sources [1,2], which could be implicated into quality and safety characteristics. Moreover, also allergenic components can be present (e.g., bee venom and 1,1-dimethylallyl caffeic acid ester) and implicated in the adverse reactions (ARs) observed during years, particularly in atopic subjects [5,6]. Objective: To evaluate the suspected ARs associated with the consumption of products containing, among others, beehive ingredients to monitor their safety profile. Methods: We analysed all spontaneous reports of ARs to beehive products gathered within the Italian Phytovigilance System (IPS), which deals with collecting and evaluating reactions to botanicals products (e.g food supplements). ARs can be reported online by health professionals, companies, and citizens on the website www. vigierbe.it. The ARs were coded according to the Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Results: From April 2002 to March 2022, 54 spontaneous reports of suspected ARs related to beehive products were collected. A previous analysis included 18 cases was published [6]. The median age of patients who experienced ARs was 37 years (Inter Quartile Range ,"" 10-55 years); women were involved in 26 cases, men in 25 while in 3 cases the information was lacking.

At the same time, feedback on the assessment is given to the patient, and personalized information is provided through interviews and dedicated informational materials. Sharing relevant information with the oncologist is done through discussion and implementation of the patient's medical record. Results: The active surveillance program has detected 293 near misses. In particular, 242 possible interactions between drugs and natural products were identified. In 180 cases, consumption of these products was discouraged, and in 62 cases, monitoring of clinical parameters and side effects was suggested. Inappropriate use was found for 51 supplements or other products. Finally, the number of suspected adverse reactions reported in VigiErbe was 4 (50% serious and 50% non-serious). Conclusion: Through active detection and personalized information, the PCD offers patients an assessment of the safety of CAM associated with conventional anticancer therapies. This service allows identifying near misses, contributing to increased safety of therapies and patient empowerment.

Unfortunately during Covid-19 a lack of training and staff awareness significantly reduced spontaneous incident reporting. Objective: Aim of the present study is analyze PMS data and organize hospital staff training to increase PMS and spontaneous incident reporting. Methods: Over the years Pharmacy and Risk Management keep a database for recording and monitoring data on MD adverse events. The Cross-check analysis of databases allows to intercept all incident or failure occurred. Results: From 2019, recorded data show a decrease of 30% related to MD incidents or failures (2019: N , 120; 2020: N , 67; 2021: N ,"" 45) and some Operating Units are less likely to reporting. In 2021 the clinical risk manager received 56 incident reports and only 45 of these to Pharmacy too. 22 were filled in by surgical departments, of which 4 by pediatricians and 18 by adult specialists. The total number of reports shows that 80% have reached the pharmacy office, while the percentage ratio between the two sectors is expected to be 100%. Conclusion: The PMS management in AOUI requires a strong collaboration of all figures involved in this process. For this reason, training and awareness-raising must be carried out in a widespread and continuous way. In AOUI Hospitals we are organizing training meetings to sharing information between various professional skills so that any problems arising are quickly identified. One target for 2022 is a participation to training events for at least one doctor and nurse for each hospital unit. References/Further Sources of Information""",1.0,clinical,True

Methods: We analyzed current regulatory guidelines throughout the lifecycle of combination products and compared old and new approaches to risk-based quality and safety management for current good manufacturing practices and during pre-clinical and clinical phases of combination products development. Cause-effect analysis for major risk categories in clinical trials with combination products was performed. Results: The results of our analysis are based on observations from 25 clinical trials, which were conducted with combination products. Based on our findings, we proposed practical recommendations for the development of KRIs to improve conduct and ensure safety of research subjects in trials with combination products by utilizing riskbased quality and safety management approach. Conclusion: Combination products, due to their specific nature, can increase risks while being tested in clinical trials. Metrics critical to risk-based quality and safety management should be linked to particular processes within development program for combination products.

2969,"Introduction: The Dutch Reporting and Expertise Centre for Adverse Effects of Medical Implants (MEBI) was established in 2017 to facilitate early detection of adverse effects related to medical implants. In March 2021 MEBI issued an alert about possible health complaints when using the copper intrauterine device (IUD) IUBTM Ballerine“ MIDI after a relatively high number of reports were received about this copper IUD, mainly from healthcare professionals. In that alert MEBI called on healthcare professionals and the public to report problems associated with the use of copper IUDs [1]. Objective: To identify potential associations between the use of copper IUDs and health complaints. Methods: Reports were submitted via online questionnaire and analyzed by a multidisciplinary expert team. Additional data were collected about potential risk factors for IUD dislocation, expulsion or uterine perforation. Results: Between January 2020 and July 2021 MEBI received 253 reports about IUBTM Ballerine“ and 110 reports about other copper IUDs. Health complaints related to IUBTM Ballerine“ were more frequently related to a reduced functioning of the IUD, such as a (partial) expulsion or an unplanned pregnancy (see table 1) [2]. Conclusion: The nature of the complaints about IUBTM Ballerine“ were different from those of other copper IUD's. To ascertain whether certain problems are more commonly associated with a certain IUD, their frequency needs to be calculated in relation to the total number of IUDs placed and eventually compared to other types of IUDs. Such analyses are not yet possible as no national data are available about IUD implantations.. MEBI strives to provide insight and transparency into all received reports about IUBTM Ballerine“ and other copper IUDs, and therefore published an update to the alert in November 2021 [2].",1.0,,True

The plan entailed a workflow network connecting vaccination sites, health directorates with the ministry of health. Engaging the consumers in safety surveillance was unprecedented in Iraq due to multiple challenges. Objective: To establish a feasible route to receive AEFI reports directly from the consumers. Methods: A self-assessment form was developed to collect the necessary information for a valid AEFI report in four languages (Arabic, English, Kurdish, and Turkish). It was validated internally and externally. An instructional video was embedded within the form. The Iraqi pharmacovigilance center's WhatsApp account was used to disseminate this form. When the consumer messages the number, an automatic message will appear containing the form link.

2994,"Introduction: In August 2020, the new Law on Medicines was adopted in Montenegro, which for the first time allows patients to report suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) directly to the Institute for Medicines and Medical Devices (CInMED) [1]. According to the experience of many countries, patient reports are an important source of information on the safety of medicines [2, 3, 4]. Objective: Analyze reports submitted to CInMED by patients Methods: A retrospective analysis of reports submitted by patients from August 2020 to May 2022 was performed. Reported ADRs were coded using the appropriate Lowest Level Term (LLT) of the MedDRA. Results were analised at MedDRA Preferred Term (PT) level. Important Medical Events (IME) list was used in assessing seriousness of cases. Descriptive statistics were used. Results: All reports submitted by patients were valid. In the mentioned period, patients submitted 45 reports, which contained 200 reactions (4.4 reactions per report). Of these, 40 reports (88.9%) were related to adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) with COVID-19 vaccines. This represents 9.1% of the total number of reported AEFIs for COVID-19 vaccines in Montenegro. The majority of patient reports (32; 71.1%) were submitted via the eReporting module for VigiFlow [5]. Women submitted 28 (62.2%) reports, and men 17 (37.8%). Reports were mostly submitted by adult patients, 18-64 years old (34; 75.5%). A total of 8 (17.8%) reports described serious adverse reactions.

3006,"``Patient Safety Council'' is a successful example of collaboration between PAs and Pharma Industry. The initiative, supported by Roche, involves 5 PAs, representing patients affected by major pathologies, with the aim to promote patient engagement on PV, increase the awareness on PV topics and the dialogue between patients and HCPs on safety & tolerability. Methods: Patient Safety Council addressed the topic of awareness of PV processes in a structured way: from a specific survey [4], to initiatives for addressing the unmet need underlined, to events for raising discussion among experts, patients and institutional stakeholders. Results: The Patient Safety Council set up projects like information material for patients, educational webinar with PV experts for patients and PAs members, communication of real PV examples, in order to overcome language and technical barriers in healthcare and to address some of the needs identified and stimulate patient engagement. The future goal is to identify new safety needs related to healthcare models in development (e.g. home treatments, telemedicine). Conclusion: Bringing PV stakeholders and PAs together could create a ``culture'' of PV. It is important to establish a trustful and transparent environment where patients can become advocates and advisors, providing scientifically reliable, objective, comprehensive information on medicines research and development. The evolution of PV lies in becoming multidisciplinary, not limited to clinical experts, finding solutions of mutual value for patients with Regulatory Authorities, PAs and key players of the Health System.

Objective: To investigate Romanian patients' attitudes toward deprescribing using the revised Patients' Attitudes Towards Deprescribing (rPATD) questionnaire. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients 65 years and older with at least one chronic condition and one chronic medication referred to two Internal Medicine departments in a large University hospital. We applied a survey that contained questions on participant demographic characteristics, the rPATD questionnaire, and the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) specific concerns section. The rPATD was translated/back-translated into Romanian and cross-culturally adapted for the study. It consists of 22 questions grouped into 4 factors: perceived burden of medication, concerns about stopping medications, involvement in decisions about medications, and appropriateness of medications (each scored 1-5) and two global questions. A higher factor score indicates a greater perceived burden, concerns about stopping, involvement and appropriateness. The BMQ specific concerns questionnaire, previously validated in Romanian is scored 5-25 with higher scores indicating stronger concerns about the medication's potential adverse consequences. Results: Most (217, 99%) of the 219 participants were retired, with a mean age of 72 years (standard deviation [SD] ,"" 5.51). The majority were women (58%), living with family (72%) and from urban residency (62%). Participants reported a median of 6 (interquartile range [IQR] 4-7.5) chronic conditions and 7 (IQR 5-9) chronic medications. The highest scores were for the involvement in decisions about medications factor (median 4.6, IQR 4.2-5), followed by the appropriateness (median 3.4, IQR 2.8-4), burden (median 2.6, IQR 1.6-3.6), and concerns about stopping (median 2.4, IQR 1.8-2.8) factors. 84% of the patients responded ``strongly agree'' to the question ``If my doctor said it was possible, I would be willing to stop one or more of my regular medicines'', and 68.95% of the patients responded ``strongly agree'' to ``I am satisfied with my current medication''. The mean BMQ-specific concerns scale score was 11. Conclusion: The great majority of patients would be willing to stop their medication if their doctor said it was possible. However, participants generally felt that their medications were appropriate, and the majority felt satisfied with their current medication. These findings may inform future research into how to best engage Romanian patients in the deprescribing process. Psychometric properties of the Romanian version of rPATD will be further evaluated.

3022,"Introduction: African populations are the largest global recipients of antiretroviral therapy (ART) yet contribute less than 1% of post licensing adverse event (AE) reports to the WHO PV database VigiBase TM(1, 2). Dolutegravir (DTG) was rolled out for use in African ART programmes, however there's a paucity of studies providing AE information from those populations. Direct reporting by patients to the national regulator has not been widely adopted in African countries but has improved reporting and detection of new signals elsewhere (3, 4). Use of mobile phone systems has also been proposed as an intervention to improve reporting (5, 6). Objective: To determine whether an intervention of clinicians and patients using toll-free phone systems results in improved reporting of AEs compared to clinicians using standard paper-based reporting methods. Methods: We conducted a quasi-experiment study between MayNovember 2021 at three health centers in Kampala, Uganda with similar baseline reporting rates. We trained clinicians working in the HIV clinic with a standard package on pharmacovigilance and DTG AEs, at one health center (HC1) and also provided details of the tollfree number based at the National Drug Authority. In the second center (HC2) we provided the same training to patients on DTG-based regimens and the toll-free number. In the third center (control) we trained clinicians and encouraged use of existing paper-based reporting methods (HC3). We compared the monthly reporting rates from the two intervention centers to the control using 2-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We summarized the AEs to DTG reported and compared them with the manufacturer's drug information label for new signals. Results: We trained four clinicians in HC1 and another four in HC3. In HC2, 493 patients were enrolled with the majority female (430/ 493,87%) and of median age 32 years (IQR 27-39). Monthly reporting rates were significantly higher in HC2 (138 reports received) compared to HC3 (0 reports) (p , 0.003). While reports in HC1 (3 reports received) were not significantly different compared to HC3 (p ,"" 0.317). HC2 reports were made by 137 patients (87% female) of median age 34 years (IQR 28-40). Patients reported a total of 346 AEs with a median number of 2 AEs per patient (IQR 2-4). New signals emerging reported by patients included forgetfulness (5), loss of libido (8) and menstrual cycle changes (10). One report of forgetfulness was received from HC1. Conclusion: Patients engagement in AE reporting in Uganda using toll-free phone systems can significantly increase reporting rates to the regulator with new signals emerging.

In recent years a new trend has established worldwide, allowing patients to directly report ADRs to national pharmacovigilance authorities [2]. A consumer, defined as a nonhealthcare professional, is now also considered as a source of information on the safety of a medicinal product [3]. Objective: To identify numerosity and level of the involvement of citizens in ADR reporting in Sardinia. Methods: We extracted data using Vigisegn platform from the Sardinian Region, from 2013 to 2021, for ADRs, stratified by year and qualification of the signaler. ADRs were also analyzed by severity, outcome, SOC (System Organ Classification) and ATC2 (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System, level 2). Results: In Sardinia, from 2013 to 2021, 6.591 ADR reports were recorded, 1093 (17%) of which were by citizens. Among those reports, 75% were classified as ``not serious'' and 37% had resolved completely. From 2013 to 2021, citizen participation in ADR reporting changed significantly, from 1 to 26% (Table).",0.0,,False
3033,"In this period, most SOCs reported by citizens were ``General pathologies and conditions related to site of administration'' (596), ``Pathologies of nervous system'' (421), ``Pathologies of musculoskeletal system and connective tissue'' (328). As for SOC ``Pathologies of reproductive system and breast'', a significant increase in reporting was recorded: from 0% in 2013 to 73% in 2021. In this period, citizen reporting of pathologies of reproductive system and breast constituted 49% of the total reports. In absolute terms, the ATC J07 Vaccine was the most reported by citizens with 799 reports (2737 in 2021). Reports by citizens for homeostatic calcium drugs (H05) account for 81% (48 ADRs) of the total reports for this ATC. Conclusion: Increase in citizen reporting in 2017 and 2021 can be traced back to the information activities of the Regional Center following the introduction of mandatory vaccination and the awareness campaign for Covid-19 vaccines. Such increase reflects the growing importance of pharmacovigilance among citizens, meaning that an increasing number of citizens have now acquired the necessary tools to ADR reporting, thus becoming a significant source of information on the safety of drugs and vaccines.

Objective: To assess safety profile of cytisine treatment on a hospital setting; the efficacy and compliance have been also assessed. Methods: A monocentric, observational, prospective study in smoking patients hospitalized in the medical school hospital of Verona (AOUI) treated with cytisine. For each patient, eligibility for treatment with cytisine and subsequently eligibility for the observational study is assessed. The smoker is asked to sign the informed consent form and the therapeutic plan is defined by the physician. The galenic cytisine preparation is prepared by AOUI Verona pharmacy. The primary endpoint is the number of adverse events and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the 12-month time period following start of treatment (quit day). ADRs are characterized by type of reaction, day of onset, severity and outcome. Results: In total, 300 subjects will be enrolled. In the first six months of recruitment, 94 smoking patients with relevant comorbidities hospitalized in different departments of AOUI Verona (including cardiology, rheumatology, nephrology) were enrolled. From preliminary data analysis, the safety profile of cytisine is consistent with literature data. The most common ADR is nausea, followed by initial insomnia and sleep disorder. Most cases occurred within 3 days from the quit day. No serious ADRs have been reported. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first observational study with cytisine in a hospital setting. Findings from this study support the safety profile of cytisine, and preliminary data confirm the efficacy of the cytisine in this treatment context.

3052,"Methods: A single-arm clinical trial was carried out in the 10-bed palliative care ward of a secondary hospital in Sa~o Paulo, Brazil. All patients admitted to the ward from October 2021 to March 2022 were screened for eligibility (i.e., age [ 18 years, hospitalization [ 48 hours). To identify, solve and avoid DRPs, patients' pharmacotherapy was assessed by a clinical pharmacist according to Cipolle et al. (2004), and pharmaceutical care interventions were made towards the healthcare team, patients and caregivers. [3,4] The impact of interventions was evaluated by the application of the Palliative Performance Scale (PPS), Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), Palliative Prognostic Index (PPI), and Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) in hospital admission and discharge. The present study was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeira~o Preto (protocol number 5.306.657). Results: During the 6-month period, 120 patients were included. Most patients were female (n ,"" 68; 56.7%), had a mean age of 71.0 years (19-97) with most (n "","" 69; 20.5%) experiencing neoplasms. Overall, 170 DRPs were identified in 68.3% (n "","" 82) of patients (median 2 DRPs/patient). After assessing DRPs, the pharmacist directly intervened 361 times and was successful in 78.1% (n "","" 282) interventions. Each patient received an average of 3.8 interventions (0-15), where the most common were adjustment of medication dose and suspension of drug therapy. An increase in the median scores of PPS and KPS scores was noticed, from 30% to 40% in hospital admission and discharge, respectively. When assessing disease severity, an improvement of survival prediction was observed--average PPI score from 5.4 to 2.9. In addition, the consultation in hospital discharge revealed a decrease in the report of all ESAS symptoms. Conclusion: Pharmaceutical interventions helped to identify clinically relevant DRPs and resulted in optimized drug therapy, which had positive effects on palliative care performance, survival prediction and symptom control. Thus, the care of palliative patients by pharmacists may be interpreted as a promotion of drug therapy safety by reducing drug risks. References/Further Sources of Information""",1.0,clinical,True

Healthcare is evolving and it is recognised that patient empowerment is a vital component in the success of treatment (4). Research in the use of MDS, from the patient and carer perspective appears to be sparse. Objective: The aims of this study was to explore the perspectives of patients or their carers, regarding the use of MDS. Methods: Qualitative research with semi-structured interviews was carried out with patients or their carers from the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust (BHSCT). The study occurred over a four month period from July 1st to October 31st, 2021. The overall objective of the interviews was to allow for patients or their carers an opportunity to talk freely about their experiences with their use of MDS. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using NVivo “ and thematic analysis (5). Results: A total of 14 interviews (8 patients and 6 carers) took place during the study period. From the analysis the main theme that emerged from both patients and carers was positivity regarding MDS use. In the patient cohort this ranged from 0.30 to 4.40% coverage. Patients' comments included examples such as, ``Think they are the best thing ever''. In the carer's cohort, positive comments regarding MDS use ranged from 0.84% to 7.82% and comments included, `` I think it's brilliant''. Many other themes emerged, and the analysis identified high coverage of negativity towards original pack use in both groups. Conclusion: The study identified that for those patients or carers who use MDS, continuation of care is very much dependent on MDS. The study has highlighted that MDS play a vital role in medicines management and safety. All the participants spoke about how MDS have transformed their lives. Enabling patients and carers to speak about their use has strengthened the case that MDS should not be stopped without established alternatives which offer equal or superior support.

Objective: Analyze the possibility for patients to report suspected adverse drug reactions through the Pharmaceutical Industry websites and assess how it facilitates the reporting. Methods: An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted through a search on the websites of 80 pharmaceutical companies (60 at European level and 20 outside Europe). Industries from following countries were selected: Ireland, Spain, USA, UK, Canada, Germany, France and Portugal. It was applied an auto-fill questionnaire for assessment of 10 items. Results: Comparison between brand and generic industries shown that only 30,4% of the branded industries and 25% of the generic industries surveyed present a reporting form and 23.2% and 16.7 % have contact of regulatory agencies present in their website. Only 31,7% of European industries and 20% of non-European industries have a reporting form and a total of 21.7% of and 20.0% have the information about the contact of national regulatory agencies, respectively. The option to use a research field appeared in 90% of European industries and 85% of non-European industries. Regarding the direct contact for pharmacovigilance (phone or email) to report a problem 73.3% of European industries and 85.0% of non-European industries have direct contact with pharmacovigilance. Conclusion: In general, the pharmaceutical industries websites have contact for patients to report ADRs, however it was possible to acknowledge that a significant percentage of industries didn't provide reporting form that allows patients to report suspected ADRs or a direct contact to the National Regulatory Agency. Thus, industries must improve these parameters in order to facilitate and improve the reporting of ADRs. This was a exploratory study in the field that should be deepen with a higher number of industries and different parameters between industries.

3083,"centers can access the SIAVr (Sistema Informativo Anagrafe Vaccinale regionale), a web-based platform for the registration of vaccinations that includes a section where adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) can be recorded. Up to 2018 AEFI reports collected in vaccination centers in Veneto had to be forwarded to the Local Pharmacovigilance Authority and then manually entered by pharmacovigilance officers into the National Pharmacovigilance Network (Rete Nazionale di Farmacovigilanza, RNF), the national pharmacovigilance database. Since 2019 AEFI reports are directly transferred from the SIAVr to the RNF through an API software, thus facilitating reporting by HCPs. Objective: To assess the impact that the direct transfer of AEFI reports from the SIAVr to the RNF had on spontaneous reporting in Veneto up to April 2022. Methods: Spontaneous reports of vaccines collected in Veneto were extracted from the RNF and those that originated from the SIAVr were identified. Reports associated with COVID-19 vaccines were not included in the assessment. Results: 1,738, 1,950 and 1,594 AEFI reports were collected in Veneto in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. During this period, Veneto accounted for 28% of total Italian AEFI reports. AEFI reports collected in Veneto were 1,923 in 2019 (? 21% compared with the previous year), 1,202 in 2020 (- 37%) and 1,410 in 2021 (? 17%). The percentage of reports originated from the SIAVr and then submitted through an API software was 71% in 2019, 82% in 2020, 93% in 2021 and 93% in the first 4 months of 2022. Conclusion: Data show that the implementation of an API-mediated link between the SIAVr and the RNF has proved incredibly useful since the very beginning. To date, more than 90% of AEFI reports in Veneto are submitted through this powerful tool. Compared with national data, the spontaneous reporting rate for non-COVID-19 vaccines in Veneto has been starkly high in recent years, showing a more limited effect of COVID-19 pandemic on spontaneous reporting in 2020.

3119,"Introduction: Spontaneous reporting of suspected Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) by healthcare professionals is a key activity for patient safety. All professionals involved in care and drug administration should play a proactive role in spontaneous reporting to create a more robust pharmacovigilance (PV) and Phytovigilance (PhyV) culture [1, 2]. Nurses are a potentially valuable source of ADR and Natural Products Adverse Reactions (NPAR) reports, because they administer drugs and are often present when an ADR/NPAR occurs [3]. Underreporting of ADRs among nurses could be mainly due to lack of knowledge and to heath care settings that do not support them in this activity [4]. Objective: To describe the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) of MSc nursing student about the spontaneous reporting of suspected adverse ADRs and NPARs. Methods: A descriptive observational study with an online anonymous KAP survey was carried out. The questionnaire was administered during March 2022 to the MSc nursing students of the University of ``Tor Vergata''. Results: Preliminary data was collected in May 2022 on a sample of 56 students. The respondents' age ranged from 23 to 58 years (mean , 33.8; SD , 9.52; median ,"" 30.5), 71.4% were female and the area of nursing practice was medical (23; 41%), emergency (10; 17.8%), surgical (7; 12.5%), obstetrics and gynaecology (5; 8.9%), domiciliary care (5; 8.9%) and other (6; 8.9%). Knowledge was measured through 16 multiple-choice questions and only 23.2% (13) scored more than 65% correct answers. The 33.9% (19) of respondents considers that ``ADR reporting is a bureaucratic process'', only 17.8% (10) thinks that they ``don't have time to report ADR'' and only 3.5% (2) that ``the data collected through the reporting system have little utility''. Only 8.9% (5) considers that ``the report of ADR is an exclusive duty of the physician''. The 73.2% (41) of responders declared that they were aware of PV system but only 28.5% (16) know the PhyV system. Furthermore, 32.1% (18) know where to find the reporting form; 32.1% (18) how fill it in; 33.9%, (19) to whom and how to send the reporting form; 25% (14) who is the contact person of PV in their hospital. The majority (92,8%; 52), declared to be interested in training programs on PV and PhyV.""",1.0,area,True

3128,"Introduction: The Children Pill School (PS) was developed at a UK paediatric hospital and was designed to support children aged 3-18 years in switching from oral liquids to pills (tablets/capsules) following a single swallowing training session using candies; [ 90% of trained children successfully switched to pills [1]. Objective: To explore views and recommendations of healthcare professionals (HCPs), from secondary and primary settings, on implementing PS as a health care service provided to children as part of standard care. Methods: A virtual focus group (FG) was conducted with purposive sampling of HCPs (doctors, nurses, and pharmacists) using a topic guide derived from the previous study [1]. The FG discussed HCPs views of the PS initiative and explored any concerns they might have regarding the rollout of the PS across the different clinical areas in the hospital. The FG was recorded and transcribed verbatim. Anonymised transcript was analysed using a content analysis approach to identify themes. Results: Eight HCPs participated in the FG, seven from secondarycare settings [hospital doctors (n , 2); pharmacists (n , 2); nurses (n ,"" 3)] and one from primary-care setting, a general practitioner. Three main themes were identified: (1) impact of PS initiative on child's health; (2) potential barriers that might prevent PS service working effectively; (3) recommendations to overcome barriers and promote PS. All participants shared a common view on the direct benefits of the PS on a child's health outcomes, e.g., overcome taste issues of oral liquids, improve child's adherence, improve dosing accuracy, and quality-of-life of children and their families.""",1.0,clinical,True

The disease requires early management in an intensive care unit, at best in a burn resuscitation unit. Objective: To describe the clinical, paraclinical, therapeutic, evolutionary data of patients hospitalized in the burn resuscitation department and establish the imputability of drugs in the occurrence of this adverse event. Methods: Our work is a retrospective descriptive study over a twoyear period from January 2020 to March 2022. All our cases were reported to the National Pharmacovigilance Center of Morocco and were the subject of an evaluation of the causal link between the appearance of Lyell syndrome and the drugs taken by patients according to the French method of study of imputability of adverse drug reactions in its updated version. Results: Out of 500 patients admitted to the service, 05 cases of NET were identified, an incidence of 01%. The notion of drug intake was present in all our patients. The drugs incriminated were Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim, paracetamol, rivaroxaban, a specialty anti-cold combining (Paracetamol ? ChlorphenamineMaleate ? Salicylamide ?

3145,"Introduction: Among the Canadian provinces, Quebec showed one of the highest trends in increased diagnostic rates of attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) between 2000 and 2012 (1). Recent prevalence estimates of ADHD are 6.6%, 18.9%, and 15.5% for those aged B 11, 12-17, and 18-24 years, respectively (2). Prescription rates for ADHD medications in Quebec have increased from 1.9 to 7.7% between 2000 and 2020 (3). The comorbidity and health outcomes of individuals using ADHD medications have not been described in Quebec. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of comorbidity, trauma-related events and mortality according to ADHD medication use. Methods: Data were drawn from the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System of the National Public Health Institute of Quebec (4) between 2000 and 2020. The cohort included residents covered under the public drug insurance plan between April 1st, 2000, and March 31st, 2020. Individuals between 1 and 24 years entered the cohort at either a first physician claim, hospital diagnosis of ADHD, or an ADHD medication claim. Medications included amphetaminederivatives, methylphenidate-based psychostimulants and non-psychostimulants (5).

We estimated prevalence rates of psychiatric comorbidities, trauma-related events (ambulatory records), and mortality rates (all-cause; trauma-related without suicide) according to the presence of ADHD medication and ADHD diagnosis. Differences were based on 99% confidence intervals (CIs) around estimates. Results: The prevalence of lifetime psychiatric comorbidities in individuals with ADHD medication only, diagnosis only and both medication and diagnosis were 78.5%, 65.8%, and 79.3%, respectively. Traumatic-related events were present in 48.3% of individuals with ADHD medication only, 49.4% of those with ADHD diagnosis only, and 59.0% of those with both. The prevalence of all-cause mortality was higher in those with ADHD diagnosis only (0.33% vs 0.19% in ADHD medication only, and 0.17% in both diagnosis and medication). Similar results among groups were found for traumarelated mortality, being 0.06% among individuals with ADHD medications, 0.05% among those with diagnosis only, and 0.07% among those with both. Conclusion: Differences exist in the psychiatric comorbidities, traumatic-related events and mortality between individuals using ADHD medications and those who do not. Within-subject analyses are underway and will allow for assessing the association between ADHD medication use, suicide behaviours, trauma and mortality.

3159,"Introduction: Delirium is a syndrome characterized by acute impairment of consciousness, attention and cognitive functions [1]. The occurrence of delirium in patients is multifactorial, which includes polypharmacy, clinical conditions and procedures [2]. Furthermore, medication-induced delirium is one of the most frequent adverse drug reactions in older hospitalized patients [3]. However, there is no consensus in the literature on how polypharmacy and medication with anticholinergic activity contribute to this syndrome [3,4,5]. Objective: Identify medication-induced delirium among older people hospitalized in general wards care. Methods: This systematic review was based on the Cochrane manual and the search for articles was performed in the LILACS, PUBMED, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane and Angeline Cochrane databases, without restriction of publication date. Two independent reviewers performed the selection of articles and the extraction of interest variables: medication, drug-related problems, time of hospitalization, and clinical outcomes. Results: The initial search retrieved 10,461 studies. After eligibility assessment, only five met the inclusion criteria and were further included for the qualitative analysis. A total of 1,435 participants were assessed in the studies, of which 839 (58.5%) were women. Most studies (n ,"" 3) were conducted in North America. The incidence of medication-induced delirium ranged between 7% and 19.7%. Four studies used the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) scale, and no study reported the delirium subtype neither its gravity. Regarding clinical outcomes, three studies identified an increase in length of hospitalization, one study reported reduction of functional impairment after hospital discharge, and one study revealed an increase in mortality. The main pharmacological classes reported were: narcotic, antihistamine, anticonvulsant, benzodiazepine, sedatives, antibiotics, antihypertensives and anticholinergic. The most drug-related problems that contributed to delirium were of necessity (unnecessary polypharmacy and untreated health condition) and safety (anticholinergic drug load and adverse drug reaction). Furthermore, it was possible to observe that the modifiable risk factors for the occurrence of delirium related to pharmacotherapy were poorly described in the studies (e.g., dosage, route of administration, number of drugs used), as well as the instruments used to assess causality. Conclusion: The lack of harmonization in the report of clinical outcomes, pharmacotherapy and the delirium characteristics impaired the causal imputation and identification of drug-related problems related to the syndrome. However, safe and necessity drug problems might have precipitated delirium. Narcotics were the most recurrent pharmacological class in the occurrence of the syndrome, which may increased length of hospitalization, disabilities and death among older people.

It is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor. A signal of Pembrolizumab and facial paralysis was found in the medical literature. Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) has conducted this safety review based on that. Objective: The purpose of this review is to evaluate the risk of facial paralysis in association with Pembrolizumab use Methods: SFDA performed a search of the national ADRs database, World Health Organization (WHO) global ADRs database, and literature screening in order to review all related information to investigate the causality of drug-event combination Results: Local Cases: The search in the National Pharmacovigilance Center (NPC) database resulted in zero cases. Global Cases: A search in the World Health Organization (WHO) database (Vigibase) was conducted to retrieve all reported cases between 2015 and 2021 via signal detection tool (Vigilyze). The search resulted in 28 Individualized Case Safety Reports (ICSRs). The author applied the WHO causality assessment, resulting in one case with probable association, six cases with the possible association, and five cases with unlikely association. Sixteen cases were unassessable due to a lack of information. Data mining: Information Component (IC) value was measured using the method for disproportionality analysis developed by Uppsala Monitoring Center (UMC). Zero value for spontaneous reporting suggests that the reported cases of facial paralysis have been observed equally with Pembrolizumab when compared to other medications in the WHO database. Literature: Upon conducting a literature search, two relevant studies were found. This signal was detected from a phase 3 double-blind trial entitled (Adjuvant Pembrolizumab after Nephrectomy in Renal-Cell Carcinoma). Facial paralysis was one of the identified serious adverse events (4). A case report of a 44-year-old male patient was diagnosed with extensivestage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). 6 months after receiving pembrolizumab, he developed facial paralysis and facial numbness. Pembrolizumab was stopped (5). Conclusion: The weighted cumulative evidence identified from the causality assessment of the reported cases, and literature are sufficient",1.0,Case,True

3236,"Introduction: Sexual dysfunction may be a symptom of major depression. Moreover, sexual disorders occurring in association with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) therapy is well-known but underreported. In pharmacovigilance, the phenomenon of underreporting is known, but reporting rates depend amongst other things, on the frequency with which adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occur. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine and compare the reporting rate of sexual disorders in association with SSRIs. Methods: The data were extracted from the WHO pharmacovigilance database, Vigibase, from 1967 to December 2021. Sexual disorders were identified and extracted from the database using the standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) ``sexual dysfunction''. First of all, we analyzed data. We calculated the rate of reported sexual disorders as a percentage of the total adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for each drug. We performed a disproportionality analysis through the calculation of reporting odds ratio (ROR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: A total of 337 832 ADRs with the SMQ sexual dysfunction were reported during the period of which 12 963 with SSRIs. The medication with the most frequently ADRs were paroxetine (n ,"" 3937), sertraline (n "", 3418) and fluoxetine (n ,"" 2763). The most frequently ADRs reported were libido decreased and erectile dysfunction. The physicians reported only 25% of cases. All the SSRIs have a ROR statistically significant. The highest ROR were observed with paroxetine (ROR 4.00, 95% CI 3.88-4.13), sertraline (ROR 3.27, 95% CI 3.16-3.38) and escitalopram (ROR 2.86, 95% CI 2.71-3.02). Conclusion: Sexual disorders occurring with SSRIs therapy are known but underestimated. Sexual side effect have sexual, psychological and social consequences. Physicians must report this type of ADR and improve the clinical management. References/Further Sources of Information Not applicable.""",1.0,flu,True

3243,"Introduction: In 2000, the Da-Vinci surgical robot was first introduced, revolutionizing how precision surgery, difficult positional surgery is conducted. Since then, there have been major advances in the role of technology, devices and digital in healthcare. The real-time streaming and sharing of RWD has enabled a patience centric connected care approach where wearables, diagnostic devices, EHR and laboratory findings can be consolidated, interrogated rapidly to assist clinical decisions. Novel therapies are often combination of biologics, devices and wellness. Objective: Approaches to pharmacovigilance and risk management needs to evolve with the advent of novel therapeutics from a medical pharmacological approach to a multidisciplinary approach where medical, scientific, technology and community play a significant role. Integrated therapeutic solutions may include gaming, AR/VR, 3D printing, devices/SaMDs and digital solutions. Pharmacovigilance can play a key role in redesign of such solutions to maximize benefit-risk and optimize outcomes. Methods: Pharmacovigilance processes like adverse event processing, signal detection, aggregate analysis and risk management needs to be re-evaluated for these novel therapeutics, and new sources of knowledge needs to be leveraged. On the other hand, there is also an opportunity to re-think risk management of drugs where digital devices/approaches could help early detection of safety risks, continuous monitoring and prevent serious outcomes. Results: Digital and technological advances present opportunities for novel approaches to drug pharmacovigilance, personalized healthcare and optimization of benefit-risk-outcome. As some of these digital solutions are approved as SaMDs, there are also challenges in redefining the PV processes for such digital health products. Predictive science and use of AI/ML methodologies could also transform patient profiling, risk assessment, clinical decisions and safety analysis. Conclusion: It is important to consider healthcare stakeholders beyond pharmaceuticals/biotech/regulators to also include technology startups, SaMD providers, wellness companies, healthcare education and include them in refining pharmacovigilance processes for digital solutions so that safety principles are embedded in the design process. Cross-industry collaboration and engagement with regulators is essential to prepare for these digital advances, and the future is now. There is a potential to transform healthcare and benefit patients, HCPs and wider society by leveraging these advances while managing the uncertainties these new approaches may bring.

3259,"Introduction: As part of its mission to elevate pharmacovigilance career, the Institute of Pharmacovigilance, a non-profit non-governmental organization (NGO), is developing a Global Pharmacovigilance Professional Certification system (GPPC) for ISoP. Objective: The goal of GPPC is to elevate the pharmacovigilance profession by defining roles & competencies, and testing against them. Methods: The process begins with defining standards for various seniority levels and roles within the field of pharmacovigilance. These standards include prerequisites, expected knowledge and its depth, required skills, and desired personality traits for a given role. All mandatory prerequisites are checked prior to the admission to the certification process and then the candidate's knowledge is evaluated via an online, AI proctored multiple-choice test. For specific roles, the required skills are tested on a real-life scenario, which presents the candidates with a task they need to address followed by an oral examination. Once the candidates pass the complete examination process, they will be issued a certificate. The whole process is managed by the Institute of Pharmacovigilance with the contribution of recognized experts serving as members of the GPPC Examination Boards, and newly established ISoP Scientific Board overseeing the project. Results: The GPPC is planned to be deployed by June 2022 via pilot programs. One of the crucial steps was setting up the framework for role standards in cooperation with ISoP Special Interest Group on Career Framework in Pharmacovigilance. At the same time, over 1,000 items (multiple-choice questions) have been generated and are to be validated by GPPC Examination board(s) and ISoP Scientific board. An online testing platform, including AI proctoring solution, has been selected and adapted to the needs of GPPC. Future development will focus on completing competency standards for a wider range of roles and identifying areas of knowledge for testing. As soon as a new role competency standard is defined, this role can be easily added to the portfolio for testing.",1.0,personal,True
3260,"The other stream of development is spreading across different countries and regions. The system is designed bearing in mind the possible need for localization and offering certification in local languages. The global recognition of GPPC will also be supported by a strong marketing campaign and outreach activities. Conclusion: GPPC is on the course to contribute to the goal of elevating pharmacovigilance profession as well as providing benchmarks for individual roles. In the future, the certification will be accepted as the new pharmacovigilance qualification standard all over the world.

3267,"Introduction: A core mission of the Institute of Pharmacovigilance (IPV), a non-profit non-governmental organization (NGO), is to develop a Global Pharmacovigilance Professional Certification (GPPC) which, when fully developed, will be using a pool of 5000 questions reflecting the wide scope of pharmacovigilance knowledge. A key component of the knowledge to be covered is safety regulatory compliance. To gather the relevant information with a global scope, the comprehensive global pharmacovigilance requirements profiling tool (PVReg-profiler) described in this paper was developed. Objective: The purpose of the PVReg-profiler includes: (a) Constitute a core element of the Knowlege Management System supporting the GPPC; (b) Master the evolution of the diverse global safety regulatory environment; (c) Measure the impact of regulatory strengthening policies, serving the needs of Regional and National Regulatory Authorities, International Public Health Stakeholders and Market Authorisation Holders. Methods: The concept was designed for collecting any compliancecritical pharmacovigilance-relevant requirement from any national or regional regulatory system, and to be able to evolve as regulatory frameworks are rapidly strengthening. Questions were formulated in order to serve as basis for generating multiple choice questions and standardised country safety requirement profiles for making comparative analyses across countries. A unique item numbering system was developed to allow for comparing items across versions. An initial set of 350 questions was created involving a panel of pilot experts invited to test it and provide feedback. The main challenge faced during the development phase was to address the actual diversity of requirement across countries by capturing compliance relevant details without inflating the number of items to be assessed. This was resolved by allowing for structured comments. Results: The PVReg-profiler has entered its production phase including (i) the collection by appointed country experts of the relevant information, (ii) the validation of the profile by the National Regulatory Authority, (iii) the use of the information by item makers, (iv) the use of the available profiles by stakeholders interested such as holders of medicinal product licenses and public health stakeholders involved in regulatory convergence and strengthening. Conclusion: Beyond its primary utility as a source of safety regulatory knowledge for the GPPC, this key component of IPV's ecosystem is intended to be used by Public Health stakeholders to facilitate identifying priorities for regulatory convergence and strengthening and monitor its progress.

3276,"Introduction: The context of rapid and diversified regulatory strengthening [1] makes increasingly necessary to create a comprehensive global repository of pharmacovigilance-relevant regulations including laws, ordinances, good vigilance practice documents, and guidelines. No such repository had been developed before our initiative to launch the PVRegulations repository subsequently incorporated into the PVReg ecosystem developed by the Institute of Pharmacovigilance (IPV), a not-for-profit non-governmental organisation establishing a Global Pharmacovigilance Professional Certification (GPPC). Objective: In addition to constituting a resource of knowledge backing the GPPC, the PVReg-repository is of interest for public health and Industry stakeholders, as well as for academic institutions involved in regulatory science and research. National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and National Pharmacovigilance Centres (NPVCs) are welcome to access the PVReg-repository by reaching PVRegulations@outlook.com. Dialogue between IPV and NRA/ NPVCs is welcome especially in countries where documents are issued in national language when format issues make challenging to generate English translation Methods: The PVReg-repository was designed according to a consistent architecture aimed at providing rapid and easy access to targeted documents without the need for specific training. To reach this goal, a consistent, informative, and intuitive document naming system was developed. Besides the document architecture, methods were developed for overcoming the multiple issues resulting from the diversity of the formats of the document released by NRAs from all over the world, Different translation software applications were evaluated for generating English translations. The PVReg-repository was launched on a dedicated MS365 Standard Business platform making it accessible via OneDrive/SharePoint, pending access via the IPV website. The next step will consist in migrating the current folder architecture to a document management system making possible to associate metadata to the documents in order to enable advance search. Results: The repository is populated and maintained taking advantage from multiple sources including systematic screening of NRA websites, input from IPV's network, and direct collaboration with NRAs. Currently, the PVReg-repository includes more than 2000 documents. Whilst the primary focus consists in pharmacovigilance regulations, the scope is being extended to regulations relative to Clinical Trials, Medical Devices, and Medical App. Conclusion: We believe using the PVReg-repository combined with profiles generated by the global pharmacovigilance requirement profiling tool will become the most resource-efficient way for Public Health stakeholders as well as holders of medicinal product licenses to monitor the change of the safety regulatory environment.

Pulmonary eosinophilia results from the infiltration of the lung tissue by eosinophils. It is a rare disease with a prevalence of less than 2.5% of interstitial lung disease reported cases (2). Objective: This research aims to evaluate the association between sertraline use and the potential risk of pulmonary eosinophilia as a part of the proactive monitoring program adopted by the SFDA. Methods: First, a systematic literature search was conducted from inception until January 2022, using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane library and we also searched in Adis Insight database to include English publications and studies on humans that reported the targeted adverse event with the use of sertraline. In addition to that, searching the local adverse drug reactions database and World Health Organization (WHO) database was performed on April 2022 via signal detection tool (Vigilyze) using the terms sertraline (substance (WHO Drug) [AND] `` pulmonary eosinophilia'' (reaction preferred term (PT) (MedDRA).

We then calculated and compared the ratio of the reporting odds ratios (ROR) as well as the ratio of 5% and 95% CI ROR values for cases versus non-cases in relation to the concurrent exposure to GLP-1 functional agonists (ATC codes: A10BJ and A10BH). Using the ratio of the 5% CI ROR value for non-cases and the 95% ROR CI value for cases is an adaptation of the Interaction Signal Score which represents interaction strength as the ratio of the 5% CI value of the disproportionality score for an event occurring with a pair of interacting drugs and the 95% CI value of the disproportionality score for the same event with the corresponding individual drugs [5]. Results: The results showed that the difference between cases and non-cases with respect to their association with antidiabetic drugs can be considered statistically significant (non-overlapping 90% confidence intervals of ROR values of non-cases compared to cases) for both drug classes.

This adverse drug reaction (ADRs) has been described with 5-fluorouracil and docetaxel. The drug ocular toxicity is poorly documented, in particular canaliculitis. Objective: The objective of the study is to investigate the association between drug and canaliculitis and to determine drugs implicated. Methods: We used the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database (Vigibase) comprising more than 29 millions of ADRs to identify canaliculitis related to drug exposure. Reported ADRs are coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Cases of canaliculitis were selected by using the following Preferred Term (PT) ``Dacryocanaliculitis'' until December 2021. The association between drug and canaliculitis was evaluated. We performed a disproportionality analysis through the calculation of reporting odds ratio (ROR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A ROR was defined positive when the number of cases is more than 3. Results: Of 29,758,968 reports, 94 reports corresponded to the PT.

Conclusion: Our study first describes the occurrence of canaliculitis after drug treatment. Canaliculitis is most often of bacterial origin. The limitation of the study is the number of reports. However, disproportionality analysis on Vigibase has proven its capacity in detecting increased risk of ADRs. This study still confirms the risk of infection by using Anti-Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa). These findings should activate healthcare professionals to report ocular toxicity.

3322,"Introduction: In the post-marketing phase of a drug it is important to monitor the safety in the general population. Besides the spontaneous reporting system (SRS), the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb has a Cohort Event Monitoring (CEM) system to collect realworld information about adverse drug reactions (ADRs). For the SRS, ADRs are reported at one moment in time by healthcare professionals and patients. In the CEM system, patients are followed for a period of time in which they complete several questionnaires about their experienced ADRs. Data from both systems can be used for signal detection. There is however a gap in knowledge in type and quality of information collected by both systems. Objective: To analyse the differences in type and quality of information collected by the SRS and CEM system and determine their usefulness for signal detection of possible ADRs of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Methods: A retrospective comparative study was performed using information of ADRs of NOACs collected by the Dutch SRS and CEM system between March 2017 and October 2019. Reported information was compared on type and quality; patient characteristics (gender and age) and ADR information (type of ADR, outcome and burden of ADR, and action taken on the NOAC). Chi-square test or fisher-exact test were performed with a significance level of \ 0.05, using RStudio with R version 4.1.3. Results: A total of 1630 ADRs were reported through the SRS and 1149 ADRs in the CEM system (Table 1). For SRS, the median age of patients and the frequency of haemorrhagic ADRs were higher. For CEM, the number of male reporters, non-haemorrhagic ADRs listed in the Summary of Product Characteristics, and patients that recovered or were recovering from the ADR without discontinuing the NOAC was higher compared to SRS. Also, more burden scores and outcomes of ADRs were reported in CEM. Reporters experienced a higher burden of ADRs in the SRS than in CEM.",0.0,,False
3323,"Conclusion: This study demonstrated that both systems provide different type and quality of information about ADRs. The SRS included a higher amount of ADRs, while the CEM system provided more specific information about the time course and burden. Both systems are unique in their methodologies and combining data collected by both systems would strengthen signal detection in pharmacovigilance.

3327,"Introduction: Adverse events (AEs) following mass administration of praziquantel, used as preventive chemotherapy for schistosomiasis, are generally mild and transient with rare serious problems [1,2]. Serious AEs are less likely to be tolerated by the general public as the product is usually administered to healthy individuals. Moreover, coincidental events may be falsely attributed to praziquantel. If such AEs are left uninvestigated, they could compromise public confidence and endanger the success of public health programs. Objective: This report shares Eritrea's experience in safety monitoring of praziquantel used in mass drug administration (MDA) and provides a summary profile of the AEs associated with praziquantel by analyzing data retrieved from VigiBase, the WHO global database. Methods: Brainstorming and desk review of existing documents and tools were exercised to clearly understand the strategies employed, limitations/challenges, areas of improvement, and lessons learned during praziquantel mass administration. Moreover, data mining on VigiBase was carried out with search criteria `praziquantel' as a drug substance and `Eritrea' as a reporting country on May 01, 2022. Results: Integration of pharmacovigilance activities into the neglected tropical diseases (NTD) control program was initiated in 2017. Under the umbrella of integrated systems, the introduction of a stimulated passive surveillance system during campaigns was the main strategy used to monitor AEs related to the mass administration of praziquantel.

The most commonly reported AEs, according to MedDRA, were gastrointestinal (71.5%) and nervous system (33.19%) disorders and some of these AEs were either undocumented or poorly documented. Conclusion: Integrating pharmacovigilance into the NTD control program along with some surveillance strategies resulted in a surge of AE reports, the majority of which were non-serious reflecting the product was generally tolerable in the Eritrean population. The integration was also helpful in identifying some AEs of praziquantel that seemed to be previously undocumented or poorly documented thus; triggering signal assessment. The few serious AEs were all left uninvestigated and thus, it was unknown whether they were related to praziquantel, administration error, and/or other alternative causes. Future campaigns are recommended to investigate cases of interest at the earliest possible time to prevent further harm and address false blame from coincidental events.

BA inhibits adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase, expressed primarily in the liver and not in skeletal muscle, thus making myopathy less likely to occur. In pivotal studies, an increase in serum uric acid, liver enzymes, creatine phosphokinase, and creatinine emerged as adverse events of special interest (AESI) [2].

Disproportionality analysis was carried out by calculating the Reporting Odds Ratio, using the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval [ 1 as the threshold for statistical significance (Bonferroni correction). Three groups were identified for comparison: all drugs in FAERS, other lipid-lowering agents, and statins. Results: Over the 21-month post-marketing period, 460 adverse events to BA were identified (out of 157,433 with other lipid-lowering agents), almost exclusively as suspect (94.6%), with large contribution from females (62.66% vs 52.94% for other lipid-lowering drugs), subjects aged C 65 years (63.89% vs 62.09%), clinicians (53.38% vs 25.04%), North America (92.61% vs 75.53%). Cardiovascular agents (56.09%) and ezetimibe (40.7%) were the most frequently reported co-medications. Hospitalization and death were recorded in 22.35% and 1.18% of the cases, respectively (vs 40.76% and 12.71% with other lipid-lowering drugs). Discontinuation was reported in 33% of the cases. A disproportionality signal, consistent across analyses, was found for 16 adverse events and different AESI, including musculoskeletal events (arthralgia, tendon rupture, myalgia, muscle spasms) and gout/hyperuricemia, with highly variable onset [median 9 days for gout (N , 13; IQR ,"" 1-31) and 96 days for arthralgia (39; 1-238)]. Conclusion: While no new safety issues emerged with BA, the considerable discontinuation rate and variegate latency of AESI, including musculoskeletal events, underline the need to pursue proactive and regular monitoring by clinicians and pharmacovigilance experts.

3378,"Introduction: Elderly patients respond differently than adults to many medications because of age-related physiological pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic changes. As people grow older, their gastric pH and body fat increase while their body mass, gastrointestinal tract motility, serum albumin, and total body water decrease.1 Furthermore, the elderly are characterized by a reduction in liver mass, hepatic perfusion, and hepatic clearance.1 Most importantly, with aging, creatinine clearance decreases up to nearly 50%. In the elderly, receptor sensitivity, second messenger response, and cellular response can cause an alteration of the pharmacodynamic response.2 Aging is characterized by increased comorbidities and, consequently, polypharmacy. Therefore, also drug-disease and drug-drug interactions increase the risk of experiencing adverse reactions. Benzodiazepines (BZDs) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are examples of drugs that can bear an increased risk of adverse reactions in the elderly. Objective: The sensitivity of BZD receptors increases as people get older. Because of elderlies' increased body fat and decreased body water, intermediate and long-acting BZDs are more likely to accumulate and remain in the body longer, resulting in prolonged sedation.3 Long-acting BZDs have shown to have hangover effects that impair postural control and cognitive function, resulting in more falls as compared to short-acting BZDs.3 Methods: NSAIDs are another example of drugs to which elderly patients respond differently as compared to adults. NSAIDs are bound to plasma proteins and are metabolized in the liver before being renally excreted. They accumulate more quickly in the elderly than in the adults because of lower-body water, less protein binding, decreased volume distribution, and reduced renal function.1 NSAIDs cause renal vasoconstriction and reduced renal functionality. In addition, considering that diseases common in the elderly such as hypertension and atherosclerosis also contribute to reduced renal function, it is not surprising that NSAIDs intake in these patients is associated with an increased risk of renal impairment.1 Results: Not applicable. Conclusion: Geriatric patients, especially frail and polymorbid, are still underrepresented in clinical trials despite responding differently to drugs than adults and being the subpopulation that consumes more medicines.2 Therefore, unfortunately, due to lack of data, a thorough drug benefit-risk assessment cannot always be performed in this patient subpopulation. The primary goal of the ISoP Geriatric Pharmacovigilance Special Interest Group is to promote safer use of medications in the elderly by raising awareness of why geriatric patients respond differently to drugs as compared to adults, stimulating more research in this area, and fostering a tailored use of medications in the elderly.

3388,"Introduction: The concept of community health workers (CHWs) is not new, it dates back to the early 1920's in China. Their roles and responsibilities have evolved globally. The WHO encouraged taskshifting with the introduction of CHWs to alleviate overstretched health systems [1] and low-and middle-income countries incorporated CHWs to assist and integrate HIV care at the primary healthcare level [2]. The role of CHWs in southern African health systems is crucial with regard to health promotion, supporting primary health care services and as vehicles of community participation within their own settings [1,3]. However, despite the important monitoring roles they play with patients on relatively new treatments, especially antiretroviral and tuberculosis medicines, they have almost no training in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and little material is available on this topic for this level of health worker. Objective: To develop a pilot training presentation on ADR reporting for CHWs and to receive feedback from the attendees to amend and improve the training material for CHWs. Methods: Pilot training material was developed and peer reviewed internally by facilitators and partners from Strengthening pharmacovigilance and regulatory capacities in four Southern African countries (SPaRCS) project funded by EDCTP-2 in collaboration with the non-profit organization, TB HIV Care in Cape Town. The training day session included: an introduction to the CHWs, an ice-breaker session on real-world experiences and ADR reporting in their communities. Completion of a pre-test prior to the presentation with a roleplay scenario midway through the training. A question and answer session and a post-test followed. Feedback on a Likert-type scale questionnaire (n , 14) as well as fill-in questions (n ,"" 3) pertaining specifically to the content of the training material, handouts and presentation were included. Results: Ten CHW volunteers from across the Cape Town Metropole and two training managers attended the training session on 26 January 2022 in Cape Town. 81.8% (9/11) indicated that they had experience of a home-care patient with a suspected ADR. There was an improvement in the marks for 63.6% (7/11) of the attendees (pre-test vs post-test). 83.3% (10/12) fully agreed that the objectives of the training presentation were achieved and that adequate information was included on the slides. Everyone (12/12) fully agreed that the information on the slides were easy to understand. Conclusion: The general feedback from the CHWs was positive and appreciative They were eager to learn and requested follow-up sessions and more training material on ADR reporting.

3395,"Introduction: The paucity of pediatric clinical trials has led to many medicines frequently prescribed to children without a license for use in pediatrics [1-3], resulting in an increased risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) [4,5]. Pharmacovigilance databases remain, among others, a valuable tool for evaluating pediatric drug safety in the reallife setting [6]. Objective: To characterize pediatric ADR reports sent to the Italian Pharmacovigilance Database (RNF, Rete Nazionale di Farmacovigilanza) by Calabria Region (Southern Italy) over 10-year period and to compare them to ADR reports in adults. Methods: The RNF was screened for all suspected ADR reports concerning individuals aged 0-17 years, as registered in the database coming from Calabria Region during the period 2010-2019. Adult reports (C 18 years) were also extracted for comparison. After exclusion of duplicates, vaccines and reports with missing age data, pediatric reports were analyzed with respect to time, sex, ADR seriousness and outcome, type of reporter, suspected drug [by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification] and category of ADR [by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA“)]. Main analyses were stratified according the following age groups: newborns (B 27 days), infants (28 days-23 months), children (2-11 years) and adolescents (12-17 years). A case-by-case clinical evaluation of pediatric reports was also performed to identify possible ADRs resulting from off-label/unlicensed drug use. Results: Among 6529 selected reports, 395 pediatric reports corresponding to 556 ADRs were analyzed. From 2010 to 2015 an increasing number of pediatric reports were observed, but the reporting rate declined after 2015. The highest proportion of the reports concerned children and adolescents. Around 47% of reports involved girls: trend observed in all age groups excluding newborns. Sixty reports were serious and among them, 75% required hospitalization. Improvement was the most commonly reported outcome (57.7%). Most of reports were issued by physicians (64.1%). Antiinfectives for systemic use (38.5%) was the most frequently reported drug group in children. In adults, the most frequently implicated drugs belonged to the Nervous system ATC group.

3421,"Introduction: As in other areas of health management, in Pharmacovigilance it is essential to know the results of interventions carried out and evaluate their impact on decision-making. In this regard, the World Health Organization (WHO) has published references to key performance indicators (KPIs) for Pharmacovigilance systems [1,2]. In Brazil, the Pharmacovigilance Office (GFARM) of the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa) published, in 2020, a Brazilian standard on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP) that are in line with the world's leading regulatory agencies. Objective: To evaluate the impact of the change in Brazilian Pharmacovigilance regulations on the demand for post-marketing monitoring of drugs at the Anvisa. Methods: This is a before-and-after descriptive, retrospective, documentary analysis study. In it, the impact of Resolution RDC 406/20, a new standard for GVP published in July 2020, was evaluated using a set of seven KPIs focused on the internal demands of GFARM/ Anvisa. The analyzed period was divided into a before (from July 2019 to June 2020-nb) and an after (from August 2020 to July 2021- na). Results: In the comparison, it was possible to observe an increase in all the KPIs analyzed: 10.0% for the number of risk communications made (nb , 20; na ,"" 22), 85.5% for the number of Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) received (nb "", 30035; na ,"" 55723), 38.0% for the number of non-serious ADR (nb "", 24257; na ,"" 33476), 285.0% for the number of severe ADR (nb "", 5778; na ,"" 22247), 84.1% for the number of notifications of ADR per million inhabitants (nb "", 142.4; na ,"" 262.2), 26.0% for the number of technical processes (nb "", 998; na ,"" 1257), and 9.5% for the number of technical documents generated (nb "", 483; na ,"" 529). Furthermore, when analyzing the number of professionals involved in the demands in each period, a reduction of 10.3% in the average number of GFARM professionals was confirmed (nb "", 14.5; na ,"" 13). Conclusion: Although there was a reduction in the team, there was an increase in the demand from GFARM/Anvisa with the change in Pharmacovigilance regulations. This may have occurred because of rules in line with the world's leading standards, but also because of the demand of the Covid-19 pandemic. Once implemented, management through KPIs must be ongoing to qualify the management process and the area's decision-making. References/Further Sources of Information""",1.0,area,True

3428,"Introduction: Non-fatal self-harm (SH) is a major risk factor for latelife suicide. Research on use of psychotropic medications in older adults who self-harmed is sparse. Objective: To assess psychotropic drug use during the year before and after non-fatal SH in a cohort of Swedish older adults aged 75?. Methods: Adults aged C 75 years who visited healthcare settings for an episode of SH between 2007 and 2016 were identified from the regional register VEGA. Their data were linked with several national population registers using their unique personal identity number. Redeemed psychotropic drugs were retrieved from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register and their use was assessed during the year before and after the index SH episode. Results: There were 659 older adults who self-harmed. Drug overdose was the main method of self-harm. The overall use of psychotropic medications was high; about eight out of ten used at least one psychotropic medication before the index episode, and this proportion remained unchanged during the year that followed the SH episode in both genders and across age groups (75-84/85?). The most frequently prescribed type of psychotropic medication was hypnotics, used by about six of ten older adults who subsequently self-harmed. Antidepressants were used by four out of ten before SH and increased to 60% after the SH episode. Use of antipsychotics increased after the SH episode. Less than 5% of those who selfharmed used medications to treat substance/alcohol use disorders or mood stabilisers (including lithium). Conclusion: Our research contributes to inform healthcare professionals on the clinical management of older adults with non-fatal selfharm, in order to enhance the safe use of medicines in both primary and specialised care. The high use of hypnotics, known to be associated with increased risk of SH and suicide should be reviewed and reduced when possible. Since drug poisoning is the main method of self-harm, our findings advocate the need for medication reviews for older adults with depression and/or suicidal behavior, for the consideration of the benefit-risk balance as well as safer medication alternatives when possible.

Methods: A survey was conducted using Survey Monkey, from January to May 2020 asking about current state of participant organizations on structured BR assessment (sBRA) practices and areas for future opportunities. Each company was asked to complete a single survey based on the input and understanding across key company representatives involved in benefit-risk assessment. Results: A total of 26 companies were included in analysis respondent group. About 80% of respondent companies are conducting structured benefit-risk-assessment (sBRAs). About 67% of companies use the FDA Framework. Five companies have created their own `internal' or `company framework' which includes their unique elements. Most (86%) of the responding companies that conduct sBRAs have a dedicated benefit-risk (management) group or designated specialist(s) who lead the sBRA effort. Most (80-85%) companies have document templates, sBRA training and dedicated team meetings in place to assist with sBRA. Most companies use sBRAs for decision-making and discussion with internal safety/benefit-risk committees and regulators. Feedback received from the survey indicates the need for more detailed guidance from guidelines such as ICH M4E on benefit-risk assessment, reasonable expectation for related discussion between regulators and sponsors before regulatory submission, guidance on how and when to use sBRA and/or quantitative approaches to demonstrate the value of a medical product and guidance on how benefit-risk trade-off can inform pre & post-approval strategic decisions.

Data selection, extraction, management and extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. Data synthesis were presented as tables, including the information of population of the study, main results, described adverse effects and extract type used. Results: The results of this review are based on the efficacy and safety of cannabis-based drugs in several chronic pathologies, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia and schizophrenia. Most of the products are constituted by THC and CBD extracts, used in different pharmaceutical dosage forms as capsules, spray, inhalers and solutions. Throughout the study, each drug's adverse effects were described to understand what their benefit/risk ratio through the evaluation of the pharmaceutical form, type of extract, administration, and therapeutic indication. Most frequent described adverse effects were dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, spasticity, mental confusion, dyspnoea and vomiting. Conclusion: With this review, it was possible to verify that cannabis presented a favourable benefit/risk ratio in the studies analysed, despite of the symptoms described. Those symptoms were not as severe as the symptoms of treated pathologies and cannabis when using drugs with compounds from this plant for the diseases to which its use is approved.

Objective: To assess in clinical practice the rate of ADRs and risk factors associated with their development, and to relate them to Cmin values. Methods: Patients (in- and outpatients) undergoing linezolid therapy were enrolled from 2 hospitals (May 2021-March 2022 [still ongoing study]). They were prospectively followed over time to monitor the development of ADRs. Cmin values were measured (4) every 7 days for inpatients and at follow-up visits for outpatients. Causality assessment was performed using the Naranjo probability scale (5). Results: We report here an interim analysis on 19 patients. They received 600 mg linezolid BID orally or intravenously. 11 patients developed at least 1 ADR (for a total of 23 ADRs) during their treatment (4 patients--1 ADR, 4 patients--2 ADRs, 1 patient--3 ADRs, 2 patients--4 ADRs). 16/23 ADRs were probably associated and 7, possibly associated to linezolid based on Naranjo scores. 4 patients stopped their treatment due to toxicity (1 paresthesia, 3 medullar toxicities--including thrombocytopenia). The Table shows the most frequent and serious ADRs, with values of parameters identified as possible risk factors. Median treatment duration was longer and Cmin higher (except for paresthesia) for patients with an ADR (although the difference was not always significant due to the small number of patients). Renal function tended to be reduced in patients experiencing metallic taste or blood counts abnormalities. The median Buzele¥ score was C 7 for all patients.",1.0,clinical,True
3454,Conclusion: These preliminary data suggest that ADRs are much frequent in clinical practice than reported in the SmPC (6) and occur more often in patients with long treatment duration and high Cmin. The analysis of the full sample (100 patients) will help to confirm these trends as well as the potential interest of therapeutic drug monitoring and follow-up of blood counts and renal function to help preventing ADRs or detecting at-risk patients.

3464,"Introduction: Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) has been offering onsite pharmacovigilance (PV) courses since 1993 and in 2017 also launched online theoretical self-paced courses to increase global access to PV training [1]. In response to requests from the self-paced courses and increased PV needs due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the UMC developed instructor-led online training to assist national and regional PV centre staff to advance from theory to practice in various topics including signal detection and causality assessment. Objective: To deliver instructor-led online courses focusing on applying concepts of signal detection and causality assessment followed by evaluation of their relevance. Methods: Courses were delivered using Matrix Learning Management System in English and Spanish [2]. These were organized as instructor-led two-weeks of part-time study. National and regional PV centre staff that had completed the required theoretical UMC online courses could participate. The courses consisted of short videos and quizzes, individual assignments, and live discussions. All course elements except the discussion meetings were asynchronous. Individual assignments were the core with personal feedback from instructors to help reach the expected standard. Each course centred around analysis of a drug-ADR combination from VigiBase, the WHO global database of reported potential side effects of medicinal products [3]. The analytical process followed accepted structured approaches and used relevant functionalities in VigiLyze [4] and Bradford Hill criteria [5], resources which participants could re-apply to analysis of their national data analyses after the course. Evaluation of the course by the participants followed the Kirkpatrick evaluation model [6]. Results: Three courses focusing on signal detection and causality assessment were delivered during 2021. Fifty-nine participants from 35 countries completed either the English courses or the Spanish course. The course quality was rated as excellent by 94% of participants. The responses from all participants showed that the instructorled parts, i.e., the individual assignments where each person needed to apply the theory and obtain personal guidance during the learning process, provided high educational value. The same applied to live sessions that provided an opportunity for participants and instructors to discuss the assignments, focusing on difficulties and possible conclusions (Table 1). Furthermore, the individual asynchronous tasks allowed more flexibility compared to scheduled group workshops.",1.0,pandemic,True

3490,"Introduction: Spices were introduced in ancient times to improve the smell, taste and color of food, and some of them have made a huge contribution to cancer prevention and treatment (1). Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women with four principal therapies surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy. Although there has been a multidrug resistance, studies are being developed for new chemotherapeutic agents (2). Piperine, a pungent alkaloid, has many therapeutic actions, such as anti-cancer activities and has been reported to inhibit the proliferation and survival of many types of cancer cells through its influence on the activation of apoptotic signaling and inhibition of cell cycle progression (3). Piperine plays a role in different enzymes and transcription factors, inhibiting invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis (3). Because it is a potent inhibitor of p-glycoprotein, it reverses the resistance of cancer cells, acting as an enabler for chemotherapy (3). Preclinical research indicated that PP has the potential to become an anti-cancer agent (4). Objective: Highlight the state-of-the-art of the potential effect of piperine in the prevention of breast cancer. Methods: This literature review was performed on ``PubMed'' and ``Science Direct'', using as keywords ``Piperine'', ``Breast Cancer'', and ``Chemotherapy'', which led us to choose eleven full articles published between 2011 and 2020. Results: Studies on piperine concerning breast cancer have discovered the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in various types of cancer cells (1,3,5).

At the molecular level, piperine can influence many effector proteins engaged in the apoptotic process. It can activate both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis (3) and inhibit tumor growth by inducing cell apoptosis and cell cycle blockage (6). Piperine also induced apoptosis in triple-negative breast cancer cells via the mitochondrial pathway (1). Piperine has the potential for inhibiting cancer stem cells (CSCs) self-renewal (3). Another study investigated the synergy effect between piperine and piperlongumine, proving these two natural alkaloids show better anticancer potential (4). Conclusion: In short, piperine seems to have potential effectiveness in treating breast cancer. The role in apoptotic processes is confirmed in different studies highlighting the potential for breast cancer treatment. The synergism between piperine and piperlongumine shows a more effective approach than monotherapy. References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,flu,True

3504,"Introduction: Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease that mainly affects the elderly inducing gradual cognitive deficits and progressive amnesic dementia (1). The first and perhaps the best example of the interaction between nutrition and dementia is related to thiamine, an essential micronutrient playing a major role in energy metabolism (2). Thiamine-dependent enzymes are important components in glucose metabolism (3) that are reduced in the brains of Alzheimer's patients who also have thiamine deficiency (4). Therefore, its decline may be responsible for reducing this metabolism and thus reducing the cognitive deficits associated with Alzheimer's (4). Objective: To understand the relationship, and the effect, between thiamine deficiency and Alzheimer's disease, as both are associated",1.0,disease,True
3505,"with cognitive deficits and reductions in cerebral glucose metabolism and what are their possible causes. Methods: This literature review was accomplished on the Pubmed and ScienceDirect during the period between 2011 to 2018, using the keywords ``thiamine'', ``Alzheimer's disease'', ``cognitive deficits'', and ``thiamine deficiency'' for inclusion criteria. Ten full papers were considered for this review. Results: Several studies have been conducted to analyze the possibility of delaying this pathology with thiamine enrichment (2,4,5). It has been shown that the effects of thiamine administered orally had a mild beneficial effect on the disease (4), but if it is long term, there are no effects recorded in slowing their progression. Despite improving cognitive function (3), oral thiamine supplementation did not lead to substantial changes in brain thiamine (4). On the other hand, if treatment is given early enough, deficits related to thiamine deficiency can be reversed (4). Thiamine deficiency depresses glucose utilization by the brain. However, with the administration of thiamine, there is an induction of an improvement in the capacity to use glucose, the decrease in neuritic plaques, phosphorylation of TAU protein and the reversal of memory deficit (1). Conclusion: Further studies are needed to determine the benefits of using parenteral thiamine as a possible therapy for treating Alzheimer's disease. In short, a diet rich in nutrients that modulate degenerative processes with appropriate pharmacological therapy can increase well-being and health through a possible delay of Alzheimer's in the patient or even as an adjunct in the prevention of this pathology.

Objective: Description of the frequency and characteristics of the ADRs that led to access to the ER and detection of the drugs most involved through an online system. Methods: We conducted an experimental project of ADRs reported to the Italian Medicines Agency through the National Pharmacovigilance Network in the period from April 2021 to March 2022. The data and ADRs were extrapolated from the corporate IT platform PS Web, were analyzed in collaboration with the working group and included in the National Pharmacovigilance Network. All clinical events and types of ADR, diagnoses and symptoms were analyzed and grouped by SOC (System Organ Class) and PT (Preferred Term), subsequently entered a database. All ADRs that led to hospitalization, an observation period of at least 4 hours (starting from the first PS visit and not from triage assignment) and which led to at least one parenteral drug administration were considered as ``serious''. For all the reports made, the consequences of the adverse event were reported, as well as the outcome, and follow-up. Descriptive statistics were performed through elaborations and formulas with Microsoft Excel. Results: The number of reactions entered by our healthcare company in the period considered is equal to 214; of these 199 (93%) were intercepted thanks to the project. The results showed: 73,1% referred to serious ADRs (n ,"" 141). Most of these serious adverse reactions were caused by drugs belonging to the ATC M (22%), J (40%) and N (20%) and other class drugs (17%) groups. Of the serious ADRs, the causal link was evaluated with the Naranjo algorithm. The relationship between serious adverse reactions, demographics, patient gender and corporate health expenditure of ADRs was also explored. Conclusion: With this project and the creation of a direct relationship between pharmacist and doctor of the ER, it has made it possible to find useful information for the purpose of reporting, significantly improving the quality of the reports.

Objective: The goal was to state of the art and highlight the research on new therapeutic alternatives, pharmacological ones, that promote greater adherence and effectiveness in Celiac Disease. Methods: This literature review was performed through scientific databases such as Pubmed and ScienceDirect. In this review were included 10 full papers. Articles were selected out of the last decade, using the following keywords Celiac Disease; Novel Treatments; Pharmacological Treatments, Intraluminal Therapies, Gluten-sequestering polymers. Results: Several new promising pharmacological therapies have been discovered and developed for the treatment of this disease, namely, therapies based on the modification of gluten; modulation of intestinal permeability (1,3,6,7); modulation of the adaptive immune response (1); Intraluminal therapies; Immunomodulation and gluten tolerance (5). However, our focus will be on Intraluminal Therapies: Glutensequestering polymers (BL-7010) (5) and antibodies that neutralize gluten or the use of polyphenols to protect against Celiac disease (7). At this point, questions remain to be answered. It is not yet clear why only 5 to 10% of predisposing HLA patients will develop glutenspecific CD4? T cells and tissue damage (2). Conclusion: Steps on new treatments are on the road to be available for the Celiac disease patients, improving is quality of life. As the development of a novel medication for Celiac disease is still under preclinical and clinical phases, the conventional dietary treatment will hold its place for the time being. As an endpoint, in the long run, it is expected that novel therapies provide the possibility to include gluten in Celiac disease patients' diets.

3540,"Introduction: Outsourcing in Pharmacovigilance has grown in the last decade. However, standards and references are lacking in this area, both for initiating and maintaining a long term outsource relationship (1). The worldwide pharmacovigilance outsourcing market is anticipated to surpass US $7.5 billion by 2024, according to the latest research available at Market Study Report LLC, the report provides extensive data on market share, growth, trends and forecasts for the period 2018-2024 (2). Pharmacovigilance has received much attention in Arab countries recently due to the development of new regulations. However, there are differences in the progression of pharmacovigilance systems by regulatory agencies in these countries because only some can meet the requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance activities. Objective: The aim of this research was to provide an overview of the current pharmacovigilance outsourcing regulations in Arab countries. As well, recommending a draft guideline for good PV outsourcing practices that can be used as a starting point for the preparation of pharmacovigilance outsourcing process standard. Methods: The study was an observational study conducted during the period of from 1st of April 2020 to 31st July 2020 on twenty-two countries which are considered members of Arab league. Regulatory Authorities websites were used as source of information regarding the Pharmacovigilance guidelines Several documents were reviewed including the Arab guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP). version 2, guidelines for countries that have their discrete guidelines (e.g., Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Algeria, Tunisia, Iraq, Oman and Morocco). Additionally, a list of questions was designed and then approaching different Arab health authorities with questions regarding their current guidelines about Pharmacovigilance outsourcing. Results: Of the twenty-two Arab countries, eleven countries have pharmacovigilance guidelines, of which eight countries have pharmacovigilance guidelines with outsourcing sections.The Arab League guideline and Saudi Food and Drug Authority Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices contain seven modules with outsourcing sections mentioned while other Arab guidelines for Iraq, Algeria and Tunisia contain only one module with outsourcing section mentioned. Conclusion: Based on our results and conclusions from other articles, we concluded the need for a unified guideline for Pharmacovigilance outsourcing not only in Arab countries but also in other parts of the world.

3547,"Introduction: With the Brazilian Pharmacovigilance legislation update in 2020, companies have increased pharmacovigilance activities outsourcing, pursuing better compliance with growing work demands in the department [1]. Several factors lead companies to outsource Pharmacovigilance activities such as cost savings, lack of internal resources, and flexibility to deal with high workloads [2, 3]. A research was conducted to demonstrate data on outsourcing of Pharmacovigilance services in Brazil. Objective: To present data on the outsourcing of Pharmacovigilance activities by pharmaceutical industries in Brazil Methods: A survey with 53 pharmaceutical companies operating in Brazil was conducted in April 2022 to investigate data on outsourcing of Pharmacovigilance activities. The research was performed through an online questionnaire sent to companies associated with an union representing pharmaceutical industries in Sa~o Paulo (Brazil). The questionnaire included 9 questions, referring to data on outsourced Pharmacovigilance activities and important requirements when selecting Pharmacovigilance service providers. To protect the confidentiality of the survey data, names of companies and respondents' contact details were not accessed. Results: Results showed that of all participant companies, 70% outsource some or all of the Pharmacovigilance activities, with the most outsourced activities being case processing (63%; 19 of 30 respondents), literature screening (53%; 16 of 30 respondents) and regulatory submissions of reports (23%; 7 of 30 respondents). It was observed that 60% of respondents have outsourced Pharmacovigilance activities for more than 5 years. For companies that do not outsource activities (n ,"" 16), the main reasons being work demand are absorbed internally (36%), low volume of activities (29%), and company policy (21%). Companies outsource Pharmacovigilance activities especially to optimize resources for the internal team to work on strategic actions (30%; 9 of 30) and due to increased work volume (23%; 7 of 30). Amongst the important requirements when selecting a vendor are expertise in 67% (20 of 30), compliance in 30% (9 of 30) and quality in 23% (7 of 30). Good communication, flexibility and price were also mentioned. The main advantage observed (60% of respondents) when outsourcing Pharmacovigilance activities was the increased availability of the Pharmacovigilance team for strategic activities (signal detection and benefit-risk analysis). Conclusion: Outsourcing Pharmacovigilance activities is shown to be a beneficial alternative to the pharmaceutical industries in Brazil, demonstrating reduction of the routine activities burden for the team, thus allowing Marketing Authorisation Holders to focus on products safety profile analysis and risk management, directly impacting patient well-being and safety.

3557,"Introduction: Cancer is a clinical condition which can benefit from anti-angiogenic drugs (AADs). Given the low prevalence and the heterogeneity of childhood cancers, information about safety of these drugs in pediatric patients is only partially assessed. Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of AADs in pediatric patients with solid tumors. Methods: Using PRISMA guidelines we conducted a systematic review of the literature, and a protocol was registered in PROSPERO website. Clinical trials and observational studies reporting information on the severity/seriousness of adverse events in pediatric patients with solid tumors in treatment with AADs were searched in PubMed, ISI Web of Science and clinicaltrials.gov. Two authors screened all titles and abstracts of the references retrieved. For each included study, quality will be assessed (Risk of Bias tool, MINORS tool or New-Ottawa scale tool). Subgroup analysis will be performed by type AAD, combination regimens and type of tumors. Results: Fifty-six studies (forty-nine published articles and seven clinical studies with published results) were retrieved. Most part were phase I trials (22 out of 56), and only five observational studies were found. Twenty studies reported the number of adverse events of antiangiogenic drugs used as monotherapy, twenty-eight in combination with standard chemotherapy and eight in combination with different regimens (e.g., target therapies). Forty-five studies were included for the evaluation of severity, while twenty-six for the evaluation of seriousness of adverse events. The quality assessment of the included studies is ongoing. Conclusion: The high number of studies included in this systematic review will allow the assessment of the incidence of adverse events and will clarify the safety of AAD drugs in pediatric patients.

In our healthcare facility, the pharmacist was responsible for catalysing the process of reporting suspected ADRs by doctors and healthcare workers operating in Emergency and Acceptance Department. Since such adverse drugs and vaccines reactions could potentially have caused the patient to access the emergency department, they were responsible for a part of the requests in charge of the emergency system. Objective: The aim of this paper is to analyse the reports of adverse drugs and vaccines reactions (ADRs) that caused patients to enter the emergency department of our facility during the last 10 months. Methods: Suspected ADRs were identified by the analysis of emergency room reports written by clinicians at Careggi University Hospital during the period from May 2021 to February 2022. ADRs reports were loaded into the Italian National Pharmacovigilance Network and were subsequently analysed according to the reported drug/vaccine, the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC) class and the severity of the reaction, as well as stratified according to patients' sex and age. Results: The total number of ADRs reports collected during the analysed period and entered in the Pharmacovigilance Network was 76, of which 38 (50%) related to drugs, 35 (46%) to vaccines used for immunisation against Sars-CoV-2, and 3 (4%) to contrast media for diagnostic use. In terms of severity, only 17 ADRs were classified as serious (22,4 %). Most ADRs were detected in female patients and in adults aged between 30 and 60 years. Conclusion: The active pharmacovigilance project called FARO enabled to intercept a good number of ADRs causing patients to access the emergency department, increasing the quantity and quality of reports entered into the Italian National Pharmacovigilance Network. In the period May 2021-February 2022, almost half of the intercepted ADRs concerned vaccines for immunisation against SARS-CoV-2. However, ADRs from drugs remained prevalent, and concerned molecules belonging to various ATC classes, in particular the class of drugs affecting the nervous and cardiovascular systems. The majority of ADRs were classified as non-serious (77.6%), indicating that many emergency room admissions were inappropriate. This highlights the need of strengthening territorial medicine and continuity of care services, which should ensure adequate care of patients with mild problems.

Objective: Describing the use of 25 drugs prescribed to patients with renal failure before and after starting chronic dialysis. Methods: From RRDTL, patients initiating dialysis between 2008-2020 and in charge of a dialysis centre were enrolled (day of dialysis initiation ,"" index date). Cases with renal transplantation before the index date, those who stopped dialysis within three months after the index date, and those who died in the first year after the index date were excluded. The drugs of interest are the 25 drugs registered in the RRDTL (1). For each patient information on drug use in the year before and after the index date was retrieved from the regional drug claims register. The proportion of patients using any of the 25 drugs in the year before and after the index date was calculated. Results: A cohort of 10,334 dialytic patients was obtained. In the year before dialysis, more than 50% of subjects prescribed with drugs for the cardiovascular system (diuretics, ACEIs/ARBs, Ca-antagonists), antiinfectives, and drugs for blood and blood forming organs (antithrombotics, erythropoietins). After initiating dialysis, a considerable increase in the number of drugs was observed respect to the year before (mean number increased significantly from 8.5 (95% CI 8.4-8.5) to 10.3 (95% CI 10.3-10.4)). The most evident increases in proportions of drug use after initiating dialysis were observed for vitamin B (from 0.05 to 0.9%), anti-parathyroid agents (cinalcalcet from 0.6 to 7.9%, paricalcitol from 6.0 to 29.3%, etelcalcetide from 0 to 2.5%, authorised in 2017), iron preparations (from 29.6 to 65.2%), treatment of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia (from 26.8 to 58.4%), calcium (from 13.4 to 23.4%) and erythropoietins (from 53.6 to 82.6%). Conclusion: Starting dialysis is associated with an increase in drug consumption and often requests specific drug therapy. In the ETELDIA project we will further investigate drug patterns and perform a comparative effectiveness and safety study of etelcalcetide and cinacalcet. This will provide useful information to health policies. References/Further Sources of Information""",1.0,Case,True

Data format: to be compliant to ICHE2B (R3) and IDMP standards As of 30 June 2022, use of the ISO Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) standard based on the ICH E2B (R3) modalities will be mandatory for ICSR reporting to/from EudraVigilance [1, 2]. Moreover, the ISO standard terminology for pharmaceutical forms and route of administration will become mandatory at the same time as a further step toward standardization in all ISO countries of structure and terminology of marketed medicinal products [3]. Data location: cloud computing services GxP companies are subjected to extensive regulatory oversight and are required to analyze all risks thoroughly before adopting any new technology. Nevertheless, industries are compelled to streamline their business process and reduce costs. One way to optimize complex processes has been the adoption of cloud computing services. Potential benefits of this technology include for example cost savings, flexibility, multi-redundant sites to support business continuity and disaster recovery. On the other side, some risks may exist, e.g. lack of oversight on the software maintenance and data center governance, and cybersecurity risks. Data migration for M&A and safety upgrades Pharmaceutical companies are moving towards mergers and acquisition for potential business expansion in various countries. This implies large amount of data (PV data included) needs to be transferred from one company to another. Data migration activity becomes a challenge-based approach with many iterative phases. Main factors can lead to migration failure, e.g. inappropriate data migration planning, or inadequate data checking & validation. Objective: Not applicable. Methods: Not applicable.

Off-label use of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI) has been inevitable since their first FDA approval a decade ago. The evaluation of efficacy and safety of ICI in off-label indications is lacking. In this study, we will address this gap in literature. Objective: Evaluate the implications of off-label use of ICIs in terms of efficacy and safety in real-world practice. Primary objective is to evaluate efficacy: Complete response (CR), Partial response (PR), Progression disease (PD), Stable disease (SD), and safety: number of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) (Quantitative) and severity of irAEs (Qualitative). Methods: Retrospective cohort study. Our population included all adult patients who received one or more of the ICIs (Atezolizumab, Avelumab, Durvalumab, Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab) without an approved indication between 01/01/2017 and 30/06/2021. Data were collected through electronic medical records, pooled in data collection sheet, and analyzed using SPSS. Results: Over the study period, 836 cycles of ICI were evaluated for 103 patients. The most frequent identified indications were colorectal cancer (12.6%), hepatocellular carcinoma (12.6%) and breast cancer (11.7%). Pembrolizumab was the most prescribed ICI with (47.6%). Clinical response reported as 4 patients CR (3.88%), 14 patients PR (13.59%), 13 patients SD (12.62%); 57 patients progressed (55.33%). Safety data showed that 35 patients experienced 38 irAEs, of which 19 patients (48.7%) were treated with Nivolumab. Severity of irAEs were as follows; 19 severe (50%), 17 moderate (44.74%), 2 mild (5.26%). The most common irAEs were hepatic toxicities (23.68%), thyroid toxicities (15.78%) and hematological toxicities (10.53%). Conclusion: ICI might be efficacious in more indications yet to be approved in cancer management. However, the use of ICI out of the approved indications might not be as safe considering increased potential of irAEs. Further studies on extended use of ICI are needed.

3596,"Introduction: The growth of pharmacovigilance (PV) in resource limited settings (RLS) in Africa has been slow. It is yet to achieve the maturity required to ensure safety of medicines deployed in the setting. One of the key factors highlighted as hindering this growth is the inadequacy of funding [1,2]. Objective: This paper presents the result of a survey assessing the prevailing pharmacovigilance funding landscape in African countries, including factors hindering and measures likely to improve sustainable funding. Methods: A standardized questionnaire was developed in English with French and Portuguese translations and effectively distributed to 35 African countries during the period July 2020 to October 2021. The information sought related to features and operation of the PV system, sources of and factors impacting on PV funding. Suggestions were solicited in free text format on hindrances and measures to improve sustainable PV financing. The information was requested from the Head of the National Pharmacovigilance Centres (NPC). The data collected were handled qualitatively, analysed and presented descriptively. Values were expressed as range and median. A thematic synthesis was carried out to aggregate the free text responses. Results: The questionnaire was completed by NPCs in 24 African countries (response rate of 68.6%); with National Medicines Regulatory Agency (NMRA) and NPC in 22/24 (91.7%) and 20/24 (83.3%) countries respectively. Again, 20/24 (83.3%) countries are in the WHO Programme for International Monitoring (PIDM). Number of staff/NPC was 5 with staff ratio NPC:NMRA of 1:11. PV activities were funded mainly by Governments and donor agencies. The mode of support was by cash grants, technical and other logistics channeled mainly through the NMRA and Public Health Programmes (PHP). Few countries 9/23 (39.1%) had a clear budget line within government budgets and 85.7% had their funding linked to the NMRA. Factors identified as hindering PV funding included--lack of awareness of the importance of PV and poor prioritisation in the national scheme, unfavourable legal environment, non-generation of revenue, poor budgetary allocation, diversion of funds etc. Measures suggested to improve PV financing include adequate prioritisation and political goodwill, improved legal environment with increased annual budgetary allocation, revenue generating activities etc. Conclusion: In all, funding of pharmacovigilance in Africa is inadequate, seemingly arbitrary. lacking legislative provisions and tied to the NMRA with significant donor funding channelled through the NMRA and PHP. There is need for PV financing to be backed by statute which will ensure sustainable funding and implementation of measures likely to improve funding References/Further Sources of Information",1.0,,True

Objective: In patients without cancer who initiate a prescription opioid, to estimate the incidence of progressing to long-term use and to identify associated factors. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Medline and Embase electronic databases were searched from 01 January 2009 to 15 January 2020. Additional sources were sought through pragmatic searches. Observational studies on long-term prescription opioid use in the non-cancer population of all ages, community-dwelling or institutionalized, and reporting a definition for long-term use of prescription opioids (LTPO), incidence estimates and/or associated factors were eligible. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, with conflicts resolved by a third author. Data were extracted by one author and validated by a second author. Methodological quality of individual studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. For potential risk factors investigated in at least two studies, a meta-analysis of adjusted measures of association was conducted using a random effect model, and expressed as an odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical heterogeneity of estimates was assessed using the I2 statistics. Results: A total of 64 observational studies including from 96 to 1,353,902 opioid users without cancer were included in the review. Among prescription opioid users, the incidence of progressing to long-term use ranged from 0.2 to 703.4 per 10,000 person-years (median: 41.6), with the highest incidence found in the post-surgical setting. Factors associated with long-term use were: obesity (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.23-1.42), tobacco use (1.60; 1.42-1.80), anxiety (1.36; 1.14-1.61) and prescription for ``any pain'' (1.64; 1.39-1.95), with no evidence of statistical heterogeneity across studies. In a subgroup analysis based on sociodemographic characteristics, LTPO definition and quality assessment, the following associated factors were also found: male sex, concomitant psychiatric disorder, pre-existing substance use disorder and back pain indication. Conclusion: This review demonstrated that long-term prescription opioid use is frequent, especially in post-surgical patients. Tangible",1.0,community,True

3610,"Introduction: Innovative drugs represent the most advanced pharmacological treatment available for patients since these drugs are characterised by a benefit and a therapeutic need compared to other marketed medicines [1]. In the context of innovative drugs, Pembrolizumab increased its authorised innovative indications during the years 2020-2021. Pembrolizumab is subject to additional monitoring in order to increase and improve the post-marketing vigilance phase. Therefore, pharmacovigilance [2] is fundamental for detecting any changes in the efficacy/safety balance since in the real world drugs are used in a larger number of patients compared to clinical trials. Objective: The aim of this work is to assess the safety of treatment with Pembrolizumab, in a high-level hospital, through the analysis of suspected ADR (Adverse Drug Reaction) reports received by the local pharmacovigilance office. Methods: The list of innovative therapeutic indications of Pembrolizumab for the years 2020-2021 was consulted on official sources [4]. For the mentioned period, all ADRs entered in the Italian National Pharmacovigilance Network (RNF) were analysed. By using company software, it was also possible to trace the total number of patients enrolled in chemotherapy protocols including Pembrolizumab with both innovative and non-innovative indications. Results: Because of the expansion of Pembrolizumab innovative therapeutic indications, the number of patients treated in our University Hospital increased from 193 in 2020 to 317 in 2021. The 14 ADRs reports about Pembrolizumab (7 of which related to 2020 and 7 to 2021) involved patients with an average age of 68 years; 79% of patients were male, whereas 21% were female. In addition, 4 of reported ADRs were classified as non-serious (29%) and 10 as serious (71%). The serious ADRs resulted in the hospitalization of patients and, in one case, in the patient's death. In contrast, the 4 non-serious ADRs recovered and completely resolved. Conclusion: The present analysis showed that the number of Pembrolizumab related ADRs remained constant over the period analysed even though the number of patients treated with Pembrolizumab increased. Therefore, the drug safety profile has maintained unchanged despite the expansion of innovative therapeutic indications and the consequent increase in Pembrolizumab-based treatments.

3618,"Introduction: In an efficient pharmacovigilance system (FV) [1], reports of suspected adverse drugs reactions (ADRs) play a fundamental role in highly specialized hospitals: indeed, in these structures, the most innovative and recently marketed drugs are prescribed, needing an implementation of post-marketing efficacy and safety data. Objective: The purpose of this work is to analyse reports of suspected ADRs in a University Hospital, collected by the Italian National Pharmacovigilance Network (RNF) [2], in 2021 according to the following criteria: the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification, the severity of ADRs, patient's sex and reporter's qualification. Methods: During the period under study, all ADRs forms collected by the Qualified Person for FV were analysed through an Excel database including the following information: RNF code, date of reporting, date of ADR onset, patient's sex, severity of ADR, outcome of ADR, suspected and/or concomitant drug and respective therapeutic indications, route of administration, ADR information and reporter's qualification. Moreover, in order to encourage healthcare operators to report ADRs, the VigiFarmaco platform link was indicated directly on the Excel folder. Results: The total number of ADRs reports collected by RNF in 2021 was 383. The majority of the above-mentioned ADRs were not serious (74%), while among severe ADRs (26%) there were 28 reactions, which caused or lengthened patients' hospitalization. Most of the ADRs reports concerned drugs belonging to the following ATC classes: J class (anti-infective drugs for systemic use) with 234 reported ADRs, followed by L class (antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents) with 66 reported ADRs. ADRs reports were mainly about female patients (69%) and were made almost completely by physicians (92%), others healthcare operators (7%) and pharmacists (1%). Conclusion: Most of the ADRs reports collected by the University Hospital in 2021 concerned drugs belonging to the ATC J class, followed by the L class. Hospital physicians were responsible for the majority of ADRs reports, also thanks to the introduction of the Vigifarmaco link in the Excel folder. However, considering the importance of post-marketing drugs surveillance, it is necessary to encourage also other healthcare operators of highly specialized hospitals to report suspected ADRs.

3623,"Introduction: Pharmacovigilance plays a crucial role in improving patient care and safety associated with medicine use. However, the pharmacovigilance system of Nepal seems to be ineffective owing to the limited number of adverse drug reaction (ADR) cases reported so far. To address the current reporting gap, it is necessary to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of Health Care Professionals on pharmacovigilance which has an impact on reporting. In Nepal, such studies on the wider population are limited [1,2]. Objective: To assess knowledge, attitude, and practice of pharmacovigilance among Health Care Professionals of Nepal. Methods: A cross-sectional baseline survey was conducted among the health care professionals of 26 centers (12 Regional pharmacovigilance centers and 14 non-regional pharmacovigilance centers) in Nepal. The study sites were selected purposively and the study participants were selected conveniently from all the study sites. The sample size for this study was 2109. Data was obtained using semistructured self-administered questionnaires as well as online Google forms. The descriptive and analytical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22. Results: The result showed that out of 2017 participants, the majority (87.80%) correctly answered 50% of knowledge questions. While, 3.37% of participants could answer all the questions related to knowledge on pharmacovigilance correctly; 0.15% could not answer any of the questions correctly. The attitude score showed that 66.52% (out of 2055) participants were inclined towards a poor attitude regarding the pharmacovigilance system. Moreover, out of 865 participants who observed ADR, only 12.31% reported to a pharmacovigilance center during their professional practice. Health Care Professionals of regional pharmacovigilance centers were found to have more knowledge along with a better attitude regarding pharmacovigilance than Health Care Professionals of non-regional pharmacovigilance centers. Conclusion: Although the knowledge of pharmacovigilance was found to be good among health care professionals, the majority of the participants had a poor attitude towards the pharmacovigilance system. The reporting was lacking even when adverse drug reactions were identified. Thus, immediate actions are necessary to improve the pharmacovigilance system in Nepal.

3632,"Introduction: India is the largest developing country manufacturer of vaccines [1]. The Universal Immunization Program (UIP) of India, targets more than 26 million children and the national Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) Surveillance Program within it receives reporting of AEFIs from both the government as well as private sector health care facilities [2]. Post marketing surveillance of vaccine safety, encompassing AEFI surveillance is one of the criteria for benchmarking a country's National Regulatory Authority [3]. The Indian AEFI Surveillance program initiated the development and implementation of a roadmap for quality management system (QMS) across the chain of AEFI processes--notification, reporting, investigation and causality assessment, management, feedback and action [2]. Objective: Quality in healthcare is defined as activities and programs intended to assure or improve the quality of care in a defined medical setting or program [4]. Though clinical healthcare delivery services have benefited comprehensively from application of QualityImprovement (QI) techniques for accrediting quality of services, public health care delivery programs have lagged behind [5,6]. We aimed to establish this Quality Management System for AEFI program at different administrative levels and understand the challenges during the implementation process. Methods: Considering the niche area of AEFI surveillance, and a lack of existing benchmarks for AEFI tasks the National QMS committee was established, and dedicated human resources were hired and leveraged for the task. Core and support quality processes in AEFI surveillance were outlined and benchmarked against global or regional standards. Further, a Standards Formulation committee was established with representatives from national, sub-national and field level with expertise on program management, immunization, surveillance, vaccine safety communication and clinical practice. A pragmatic approach for a phased implementation plan from nationalfield level with as-is mapping and quality audit was planned at national level. Results: AEFI reporting, investigation and causality assessment processes improved substantially during the establishment of QMS program. Precise benchmarks for performance assessment were developed as National Standards for the AEFI surveillance program at national, sub-national and field level were recommended.

3642,"Introduction: Kidneys have crucial roles in maintaining homeostasis. If there is deterioration in their roles due to drugs or their metabolites, drug-induced acute kidney injury (DIAKI) is observed. Once DIAKI is observed, the causality between the drug and the effect should be evaluated. Causality is assessed by causality assessment tools (CAT) which could be nonspecific or organ-specific. Although there are successfully used liver-specific CAT, there is no kidney-specific causality assessment tool (KSCAT). Furthermore, current nonspecific CATs lack the assessment of DIAKI and don't cover the recently expanded adverse drug reactions (ADR) definition by European Medicine Agency (EMA). We recently published an editorial letter addressing the need for developing KSCAT (1). Objective: To suggest the possible required parameters and outline the path for developing KSCAT. Methods: We performed a screening of previously published articles on nonspecific and liver-specific causality assessment tools to define possible parameters of KSCAT. Results: According to our screening, CATs fall into 3 categories: expert judgment; algorithms; probabilistic methods. We suggest KSCAT parameters in 3 categories: (1) drug-related; (2) kidney-related; and (3) terminology. We created a tri-polar method that consists of definitive ADRs, terminology, and without ADRs so the new KSCAT be efficient, specific, user friendly, and less time-consuming. Finally, we suggest a pyramid model to offer the perspectives of experts in the fields of pharmacovigilance, pharmacoepidemiology, and nephrology, as well as decision makers, while developing a KSCAT.",1.0,epidemiology,True

3646,"Conclusion: Relating causality between drug(s) and DIAKI may be difficult and may not be assessed appropriately with the use of nonspecific tools or approaches. We reiterate the need for KSCAT development and propose the associated steps by stating the main principles: namely, the definition of ADR, suggested parameters to be included in the KSCAT, and integration of technology. An interdisciplinary consortium of selected experts from the leading organizations EMA, ISoP, ISPE, and KDIGO, and technology will be created, meeting regularly as the initial step for the development of KSCAT. The tool should then be tested for its usability, specificity, and practicality. Finally, it should be used in real-life pharmacovigilance practices, as well as in research by health authorities, regulators, decision-makers, scientists, and clinicians. A standardized KSCAT would support providing reliable and reproducible measures of the relationship likelihood in suspected cases of ADR to overcome uncertainty and provide a standardized approach.

3654,"Introduction: Monitoring safety of vaccines during mass immunization campaigns is challenging. Immunization programs usually focus on vaccination coverages and seldom invest time and effort in identifying and managing immunization-related safety issues. The safety surveillance initiatives taken by the Eritrean Pharmacovigilance Centre (EPC) following its integration into the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in late 2016 involved tactics that evolved with the deployment of newer vaccines over the years. Currently, Eritrea's experience collectively enabled the country to operate in a higher level of proactivity, implementing strategies that go in line with principles of the latest concept of Smart Safety Surveillance (3S). Objective: This report shares Eritrea's experience in monitoring adverse events following immunization (AEFI) during mass campaigns in 3S approach, presenting a lesson that can be learned for COVID-19 vaccine deployment. Methods: Tools, principles, AEFI-line lists, integration progresses, practices, and strategies used in Eritrea for AEFI surveillance during immunization campaigns were reviewed. The evolution of the AEFI surveillance system in Eritrea was tracked to observe the changes that the EPC introduced in every growth stage of its system. Moreover,",1.0,vaccine,True
3655,"search was made on VigiBase to demonstrate trends of AEFIs reporting overtime. Results: In the kickoff, the EPC started small in harnessing its integration with the EPI. In the first two years following integration, the center received only a few tens of AEFI reports through an entirely passive approach of spontaneous reporting. In 2018, the center opted for a more ambitious plan and implemented an active surveillance of newly introduced measles and rubella vaccine. Although it collected 916 AEFIs in a few days, serious cases warranting investigation were left uninvestigated. In 2019, in another highly ambitious turn, the EPC optimized its system to a more proactive approach that employs principles of 3S. Through the 3S approach, the EPC implemented strategies that enabled prevention and management of AEFIs more efficiently. Following investigation, several serious cases that would otherwise have compromised the immunization program were found to be coincidental. Of the more than 3600 AEFIs received following meningococcal-A vaccination campaign, several serious cases were successfully investigated and timely communicated. The reports represent about 80% of all the globally reported cases to the vaccine in VigiBase. Conclusion: 3S approach was found to be effective in monitoring and mitigating immunization campaign-related problems in Eritrea. Considering Eritrea's strategies might be helpful for countries having similar setting in establishing a robust vaccine safety surveillance system during COVID-19 vaccine deployment.

Objective: Estimate the incidence rates (IR), rate differences (RD) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) of myocarditis and pericarditis before and after each dose of mRNA (Pfizer and Moderna) and adenovirusplatform (AstraZeneca and Janssen) COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort design with nested self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) study. Participants were followed from 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2021. Data were derived from healthcare data from five population-based data sources in four European countries: Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (UK), and Spain. The main outcome was first occurrence of myocarditis or pericarditis. RD and IR before COVID-19 disease and after each COVID-19 vaccine dose in those without COVID-19 were calculated. The SCRI calculated IRR with 60-day control period prior to vaccination and 28-day risk windows, with adjustment for seasonality. All analyses were stratified by age (\30 and C 30 years) and in the cohorts refined age-bands for \ 30 were utilised. Results: The study cohort comprised 35,365,669 persons with median age between 39-49 years, 57.4% received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose and 77.6% of these received two. Myocarditis background rates were highest in persons 18-29 years (IR 2.8, 95% CI [1.5-4.1] to 6.4 [3.8-9.0] across UK, the Netherlands and Spain, and for 12-17 years in Italy (IR ,"" 9.9 [5.3-14.4]). Pericarditis rates were higher in persons [ 30 years (standardised IR from 11.6 [10.9-12.4] to 29.7 [19.8-22.1] across databases). RD of myocarditis were significantly elevated after Moderna dose 2 in persons between 18-29 years in Italy. Significantly reduced RD of pericarditis in the age group above 30 years was seen for Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. The SCRI showed significantly higher myocarditis IRR after dose 1 of Pfizer (IRR "","" 3.3 [1.2-9.4]), and also after dose 2 of Pfizer and Moderna in persons 12-29 years (IRR of 7.8 [2.6-23.5] and 6.1 [1.1-33.5], respectively). No association was observed between COVID-19 vaccination and pericarditis in the SCRI. In a sensitivity analysis, occasional significant association was seen for AstraZeneca dose 2 and myocarditis. Conclusion: Myocarditis is rare, but rates were increased significantly after both doses of Pfizer and the second dose of Moderna vaccines in persons below 30 years of age.

3674,"Introduction: Since the WHO declared the COVID-19 global pandemic in March 2020, vaccines to prevent severe SARS-CoV-2 infection have been developed at unprecedented speed. Several vaccines have been conditionally authorized by regulators in December 2020 already. The large-scale vaccination campaigns have undeniably raised the importance of post-authorization evaluations not only through spontaneous reporting but also by cohort event monitoring to obtain more in-depth vaccine safety information, rapidly after launch. Objective: To monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety and estimate the frequency of solicited and non-solicited, non-serious and serious reactions. Methods: We designed a prospective cohort event monitoring (CEM) study as part of the Covid-Vaccine-Monitor (CVM) project. The CEM collects baseline data, adverse reactions (ADRs) of authorized COVID-19 vaccines in the general and special populations (pregnant and lactating women, children, and adolescents, immunocompromised, allergic, and prior COVID-19 infection people) in twelve countries (Germany, Croatia, Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Slovakia, Romania, Switzerland, and UK). The current results comprise data from February 2021-February 2022. Depending on the dose and cohort, two data collection platforms are used: the Lareb-managed Intensive Monitoring (LIM) and the UMC Utrecht Research Online (RO). Germany and Croatia used their national tools. Participants meet local age criteria, have a first vaccination cycle or a booster dose within 48 hours, and are followed up for 6 months. Data are pooled, stratified by special cohorts, and analyzed. Results: We included more than 30,000 general population participants data from Belgium, Croatia, France, Italy, Netherlands, and UK, and more than 520,000 from Germany with the first vaccinations. Across different vaccines, 0.2-0.3% reported at least one serious ADR after receiving the first doses. More than 7,400 special cohorts vaccinees participated. 0.2% and 0.4% reported at least one serious ADR and adverse event of special interest (AESI), respectively, after the first vaccinations. The most-reported ADRs among vaccines were injection site pain, locally, and fatigue, headache, malaise, and myalgia, systemically. Serious ADRs and AESIs were uncommon. More than 11,100 vaccinees from general and special cohorts receiving a booster dose were also included. Among different cohorts, children/adolescents reported the lowest number of ADRs, while lactating women reported the highest.",1.0,COVID-19,True

3684,"Introduction: The rapid development and deployment of SARSCoV-2 vaccines elevated reliance on pharmacovigilance to inform benefit-risk assessments and national vaccine policy recommendations. During the mass vaccination program against pandemic coronavirus, the VAERS received an unprecedented number of adverse event reports. The VAERS database doubled in size in 2021 and accumulated 856,340 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine reports (54.3% of all VAERS reports) as of May 6, 2022 (HHS 2022). This publicly available resource has been heavily relied upon to inform US vaccine policy. Objective: To understand how VAERS has been used to study the safety of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Methods: Publications containing the terms ``Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System'' or VAERS and COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 were identified from PubMed. Non-research articles, publications that did not use VAERS or did not study SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and withdrawn publications were excluded. Key data fields were abstracted from the remaining articles and summarized through descriptive statistics. Results: 88 publications were identified with 27 excluded upon review; 1 was withdrawn, 9 were commentaries/editorials, and the remainder did not study SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in VAERS. Approximately one-half of the 61 included publications focused on one or more Adverse Events of Special Interest (e.g., anaphylaxis, facial nerve palsy, Guillain-Barre¥ syndrome, myocarditis/pericarditis, etc.) or death rather than all events or signal detection. Several special populations were studied including children, adolescents, and ``pregnant persons.'' Methods ranged from constructing a case series for clinical review to modeling. Adverse event reporting rates were calculated in 36 studies (58%). Denominators were derived from state or national vaccine administration data (CDC 2022), and included estimates of doses administered, number of persons vaccinated, and person-years. In more than one-third of the publications that calculated adverse event reporting rates, these values were misreported or",1.0,vaccine,True
3685,"misinterpreted by the study authors as estimates of incidence rates or cumulative incidence (risk). Conclusion: The rapid nationwide SARS-CoV-2 vaccine rollout resulted in an unprecedented volume of VAERS reports, which have been relied upon to investigate rare adverse events and inform vaccination policy. The methods and scientific rigor of vaccine adverse event studies varied considerably. Despite the inability to calculate incidence or risk using voluntary adverse event reports, these terms were frequently used instead of, or interchangeably with, reporting rate. Where a causal relationship exists, relying on reporting rates as a proxy for incidence may substantially distort estimates of harms (Weiss 2022).

Since their release, they have proven to be an effective strategy to prevent hospitalizations. Although clinical trials granted their efficacy and safety, real-life data on the possible effect of these drugs are lacking [1,2]. Objective: To evaluate the real-life safety of oral antivirals for COVID-19 by retrospectively assessing the number and type of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) detected in clinical practice. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of patients referred to the outpatient clinic for the early treatment of COVID-19 at the Infectious Diseases Unit of the University Hospital of Padua. Patients' clinical data and ADRs were collected. Each ADR was recorded in the National Pharmacovigilance Network. Data were anonymized and subsequently analyzed through R software. Qualitative variables were expressed as absolute numbers and percentages and compared using the Chi-square test. Quantitative variables were expressed as mean or median and compared by T-test or MannWhitney test whenever it was more appropriate. Results: 109 consecutive patients with a median age of 73 years were included. 49 were male and 15 were unvaccinated for COVID-19. 74 (67.9%, Group1) patients received nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 35 (32.1%,) molnupiravir (Group2). Median age was significantly higher for group2. Regarding ADRs analysis, a total of 49 (44.9%) patients reported at least one adverse event, of which 7 belonged to Group 2 and 42 to Group 1 (p \ 0.01).

Little information is available on cohorts with specific comorbidities. Few studies evaluate the safety in allergic subjects, in particular as related to the anaphylaxis risk. Objective: To investigate the association between anaphylaxis after Covid-19 vaccines and the history of hypersensitivity reactions to the most common allergens. Methods: The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS, January 2020-December 2021) was downloaded and cleaned. We focused on reports of Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs) following COVID-19 vaccination in subjects [ 12 years old with history of allergy. We performed a descriptive analysis and calculated the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) to identify demographic characteristics and allergic histories disproportionally reported with anaphylaxis for each Covid-19 vaccine and the most recorded allergens. Results: We retrieved 183,860 AEFI reports recording any allergic history (864 anaphylaxis reports among cases vs 6,162 in Covid-19 reports without history of allergy). They concerned mostly women (81.3%) and adults (74.0%). Almost all reports were submitted in the US (99.7%) and 38.3% of them resulted in hospitalization. Covid-19 vaccines administered were Spikevax (49.3%), Comirnaty (42.1%), and Janssen (8.4%). The antigens most recorded as allergens were penicillins (49,407), sulfa drugs (37,365), opioids (26,398), seafood (12,039), latex (11,442), NSAIDs (11,319), cephalosporins (8,379), quinolones (8,023), macrolides (7,586). Seafood allergy resulted associated with anaphylaxis for Comirnaty (ROR ,"" 2.80; 95% CI 2.20-3.56), Spikevax (2.57; 1.88-3.51), and Janssen (2.67; 1.39-5.11). Latex allergy was associated with anaphylaxis for Comirnaty (ROR "","" 1.92; 95% CI 1.45-2.55). Conclusion: We gathered evidence pointing towards a preferential development of anaphylaxis in patients with an history of hypersensitivity to seafood (for all Covid-19 vaccines) or latex (restricted to Comirnaty). Whether confirmed by further studies, this knowledge may drive a more practical anamnesis and a prompt management of anaphylactic reactions.

Because a large population is vaccinated in a short period of time and the fact that venous (VTE) and arterial thrombosis (ATE) are quite common conditions, the number of reports should be compared with background incidence rates as part of signal detection. Objective: We evaluated the use of Standardised Morbidity Rates (SMR) to compare spontaneously reported cases of thromboembolism with COVID-19 vaccines with stratified Dutch background incidence rates from 2019 in the vaccine exposed population. Methods: SMRs are calculated by dividing the reported as observed (O) cases by the expected (E) number within risk windows of 14/28 days following each dose and vaccine. SMR [1 indicates that more cases were reported than expected [6]. Results: Until 9 December 2021, 2080 reports were received concerning at least one thromboembolic event with 24 million administered COVID-19 vaccines. These concerned 1000 of VTE, 956 of ATE, 19 of CVST and 134 reports of miscellaneous forms of thrombosis. Cases of VITT (TTS) were excluded. In the table the main results are summarized and highlighted. For AstraZeneca, SMRs reach or exceed 1 for VTE, ATE and CVST, especially in people aged \ 60 years. With the second dose of mRNA vaccines more cases of the rare condition CVST were observed in men, although absolute numbers are low; n , 3 for men with 2nd dose of Pfizer (14 days) and n , 1 for men with 2nd dose of Moderna (28 days).",1.0,vaccine,True
3711,"Conclusion: SMRs can be used when the exposed population is defined, stratified background incidence rates are available and the reporting rate is substantial. The rate of underreporting is unknown, differs in population subgroups, and is influenced by media attention. Therefore, SMRs near 1 are also considered to be `high'. Our data cannot confirm nor exclude a potential signal of other types of thromboembolism with COVID-19 vaccines. But the potential signal initiated further epidemiological research to confirm and quantify a potential increased risk of thromboembolism with COVID-19 vaccines.

To offset real or perceived safety issues, it is critical to be prepared to respond quickly, especially when dealing with adverse events of special interest (AESIs) as defined by World Health Organization WHO. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS is a passive reporting system, which means that it relies on people to report their experiences to the CDC and FDA. Objective: This study aims identify AESIs in children aged 5 years old to less than 18 years old who were vaccinated with Pfizer Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine in the United States according to VAERS database. Methods: VAERS data on the Pfizer Biontech COVID-19 vaccine in children (aged 5 years old and less than 18 years old) were identified and saved. We retrieved all reports from 2020 to May 13, 2022. The analysis excluded reports with incomplete event details, age, or duplicate reports. The World Health Organization's COVID-19 vaccines safety surveillance manual, 2nd edition, was used to define AESIs. The frequency of AESIs was calculated as a percentage of the total number of reported adverse events in the database. The chisquare test was used to assess correlations between other reported demographic information. Statistical significance is defined as a P-value of less than 0.05. Results: A total of 33,101 (50.4% males, 47.2% females) unique VAERS ID pediatric primary cases aged 5 years old and less than 18 years old were identified taking Pfizer Biontech COVID-19 vaccine and included in the final analysis.

3729,"Introduction: One use of healthcare utilization data is for ``near realtime'' sequential postmarket safety surveillance of medical products. Sequential Database Surveillance (SDS) assesses evidence of association with respect to exposure-outcome pair. During surveillance, the incidence rate of the exposure-outcome pair is continuously compared with a historical, concurrent, or self-control population as data accrue. If a statistical signal of excess risk is identified, the null hypothesis of ``no excess risk'' is rejected. If not, the SDS ends at a predetermined stopping point while failing to reject the null. Any detected statistical signal is followed by confirmatory assessments to validate or refute the finding. Objective: To identify which is the more optimal configuration of healthcare databases for obtaining a surveillance system for postmarket safety surveillance of medical products in Lombardy Methods: A SDS has been performed in Lombardy (10 million inhabitants) by investigators of the Regional Epidemiologic Observatory and the University of Milano-Bicocca. Optimal design and analysis aspects of postmarket SDS are less developed than sequentially monitored clinical trials.The key difference is that clinical trials typically prioritize power and sample size whereas postmarket SDS places a high priority on power and the time to detect a signal. This attention to the calendar time to detect a signal is important because of potential harm to the general population from delayed detection of a safety problem. Results: The postmarket SDS has been performed in our observational setting, where the investigator has no control over information accrual within each data source. Investigators must select how many observational healthcare databases to monitor and the duration of monitoring. First, the investigator must consider each database's contribution to sample size, which depends on the size of the population of interest. Secondary attributes, such as delays and misclassification errors in data capture, also are important. Finally, the database-specific cost may increase considerably if medical chart validation accompanies surveillance.",1.0,clinical,True
3730,"To illustrate these design choices, our research group wished to detect a given incidence rate ratio of myocarditis among citizens who received mRNA vaccine with 80% power, which required a given amount of person-years of exposure to vaccine. Conclusion: This pilot project will attempt to answer to the question: ``which is the more optimal configuration of healthcare databases for obtaining a surveillance system for postmarket safety surveillance of medical products of Lombardy?`` To support quick detection, SDS analyses depend on amassing sufficient information (sample size) to reach a stopping point, either by rejecting the null or ending surveillance.

ADRs and drug intoxications were the most identified events in all systems. Women were the most affected by ADE in Notivisa, while men were more affected by severe ADE. The age group most identified with ADE was 30-59 years. The vast majority of ADE reported in Notivisa originated from Sentinel Hospitals (55.6%), while in SIH and SIM the vast majority were from data from ``Other hospitals''. Conclusion: The list of triggers prepared for this study proved to be an applicable, simple and low-cost approach that allows the screening of ADE in any health database, using the ICD-10 as the diagnostic classification system. of diseases. The results of this study are important in this moment of strengthening the patient safety culture, together with the growth of computer technology applied to electronic health records, which can facilitate the management of these events in the hospital environment and contribute to the capture of relevant information for the WHO drug monitoring program and strengthening pharmacovigilance in Brazil.

3774,"Introduction: COVID-19 vaccines were rapidly authorized leaving many questions and the need to monitor safety intensively. Objective: Multi-national collaboration was established with the aim to monitor the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines through prospective cohort event monitoring in Europe. Methods: A prospective cohort event monitoring study was conducted with primary consented data collection in seven countries between December 2020 and November 2021. Participants in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands and United Kingdom registered using the LIM web app and received follow-up questionnaires for six months. Participants from Croatia and Germany registered with the OPeN and SafeVac2.0 apps respectively. Rates of self-reported reactions were described by type (solicited, non-solicited), adverse event of special interest (AESI), seriousness, and stratified by vaccine brand. The rate of self-reported adverse reaction was calculated after dose 1 and prior to dose 2 among all subjects who responded with at least one questionnaire. Results: 117,791 participants were included and responded to the first questionnaires after baseline: 88,196 from Germany, 27,588 from the Netherlands, 984 from France, 570 from Italy, 326 from Croatia, 89 from the United Kingdom and 38 from Belgium. 89,377 respondents received AstraZeneca, 14,658 BioNTech/Pfizer, 11,266 Moderna and 2490 Janssen. Reporting included all vaccine brands from all countries, except Germany which only included data on Moderna until May 2021 and AstraZeneca until September 2021. Median time to completion was 8 days for the first questionnaire after dose 1 (Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, France, United Kingdom) and 3 days in Croatia. Median age category was 40-49 for all vaccine exposed groups except for BioNtech/Pfizer where median age was 70-79. Fatigue and headache were the most commonly reported solicited systemic adverse reactions, injection site reactions the most common solicited local reaction. AESIs were very rare (\ 0.1%) and serious adverse reactions were uncommon (\ 1%) across all vaccine brands. Conclusion: This study that collated self-reported data from more than 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine recipients, demonstrated feasibility of setting up and conducting cohort event monitoring across multiple European countries to collect safety data on novel vaccines that are rolled out at scale in populations which may not have been included in pivotal trials. Different vaccination schedules in countries and different web applications resulted in some heterogeneity. The study confirmed the safety information in the product labels: reactogenic reactions, related to immunogenic response, and local injection site reactions were very common across all vaccines, whereas serious reactions or AESIs were (very) rare.

3781,"Introduction: Marketed COVID-19 vaccines showed an overall favourable safety profile in pivotal trials. However, those trials did not include high risk/fragile patient categories; hence, close monitoring of COVID-19 vaccine safety in those special cohorts in real-world setting is needed. The European Medicines Agency-funded ``CovidVaccine-Monitor'' project was set up to prospectively measure the incidence of solicited/unsolicited adverse events following COVID19 vaccination in several European Countries as reported by vaccinees through web-based questionnaires. Italy is one of the Countries participating in the project as a large network named ``ilmiovaccinocovid19 collaborating group''. Objective: To measure the incidence of vaccinee-reported adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) with marketed COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant and lactating women, pediatrics, immunocompromised, people with history of allergy and people with prior SARSCoV-2 infection in Italy. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study of the abovementioned categories of vaccinees, who were recruited at multiple vaccination centers within 48 hours from either the first or booster COVID-19 vaccine dose administration. After providing informed consent and get registered into the web-app, vaccinees were asked to fill in an electronic baseline questionnaire and 6 follow-up questionnaires at different time points, within 6-month from vaccine administration, in which information on potential vaccine-related AEFIs were collected. We explored and compared the frequency of local and systemic solicited adverse events following first or booster dose for each special cohort and vaccine brands. Results: Overall, 1,331 vaccinees (40.4% first dose and 59.6% booster dose) were included in the analysis. Of these, 8.4% were immunocompromised, 32.0% had history of allergy, 25.5% had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, 23.4% were children/adolescents, 6.2% were pregnant and 4.6% were lactating women (non-mutually exclusive cohorts). Of subjects belonging to at least one cohort, 52.3% reported at least one AEFI following either the first or booster dose. Among all special cohorts, injection site pain was the most frequently reported solicited local AEFI, after both the first (37.5%) and booster (39.5%) dose. As solicited systemic AEFIs, headache (19.0%) was the most frequently reported after the first dose, while malaise (23.7%) and fatigue (23.7%) after the booster dose. The frequency of severe AEFIs was very low following both first dose (0.8%) and booster dose (0.6%).

This included assessment of patients' potential to become pregnant, pregnancy testing, contraceptive use and annual review of ongoing treatment. Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of the 2018 RMMs in five European countries/regions. Methods: An observational pharmacoepidemiological times-series study of females of childbearing age (12-55 years) was conducted using electronic healthcare databases from five countries/regions (Jan. 2010-Dec. 2020): Denmark (DNR), Italy (ARS Tuscany), the Netherlands (PHARMO), Spain (BIFAP), and the UK (CPRD). Clinical and demographic information from each source was transformed to the ConcePTION common data model [3], quality checks were conducted and a distributed analysis was performed using common analysis scripts. Incidence and prevalence rates of valproate use, proportion of valproate discontinuers and switchers to alternative medicine, frequency of pregnancy testing and contraception prior to and after valproate use, and occurrence of pregnancies during valproate exposure were estimated per month. Interrupted time series analyses were conducted to estimate the level or trend change in the mentioned outcome measures. Results: There were 69,533 valproate users out of 9,699,371 female subjects of childbearing age from the five participating centres (median follow-up 3.5-10.0 years, mean age at baseline C 30 years). We observed a statistically significant decline in prevalent use of valproates in all countries/regions, but no significant decreasing trend in incident use after the 2018 RMMs compared to the period before. The monthly proportion of compliant valproate prescriptions/dispensings with a contraceptive coverage was low (ranged between 0.5-25%), without an increasing trend after the 2018 RMMs across the studied databases.

3791,"The only significant increase in trend in switching rates from valproates to alternative medicine after the 2018 RMMs was observed in ARS Tuscany. There was a substantial number of concurrent pregnancies during valproate exposure, but with a declining rate after the 2018 RMMs in ARS Tuscany (0.70 per 1000 valproate users pre- and 0.27 post-intervention), BIFAP (0.48 and 0.13) and PHARMO (0.34 and 0.00), and an increasing rate in CPRD (1.13 and 5.07). Conclusion: There was a small impact of the 2018 RMMs on valproate use in the studied European countries/regions. Despite the declining rates of concurrent pregnancies with valproate use after the 2018 intervention, the occurrence of a substantial number of such events warrants a careful monitoring of the existing policies and regulations on valproate use in Europe.

3798,"Introduction: Since the legalization of cannabis for non-medical purposes in Canada on October 17, 2018, there have been changes in the landscape including increasing availability of legal cannabis products, ongoing public knowledge and education on cannabis, an outbreak of vaping-associated lung illness and the covid-19 pandemic. These shifting contexts may have influenced cannabis use behaviours, and the number and type of cannabis adverse reactions (ARs) reported since legalization. Health Canada's (HC) Vigilance Framework for Cannabis Products allows for the monitoring, detection, assessment and risk management of ARs to support regulatory decision-making, knowledge translation and public communication of the safety of cannabis products. Objective: The objective of this presentation is to provide an interyear comparison of ARs associated with legal cannabis products reported to HC during the first year (October 17, 2018-December 31, 2019), second year (January 1, 2020-December 31, 2020) and third year (January 1, 2021-December 31, 2021) of legalization. Methods: A descriptive, comparative analysis of AR cases involving legal cannabis products received by HC from October 17, 2018 to December 31, 2019 (referred to as 2018-2019), January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2021-December 31, 2021 was conducted to characterize ARs across these three reporting periods.",1.0,outbreak,True

Cases more frequently involved females than males in all periods, while AR cases in 2020 and 2021 more frequently involved older adults (65? years), whereas middle age adults (35 to 64 years) accounted for the largest proportion of cases in 2018-2019. Ingestible cannabis extracts (e.g., cannabis oils in liquid or capsules) were the most frequently reported suspect cannabis product in AR cases across three reporting periods despite widening availability of other types of legal cannabis products (cannabis topicals, other extracts such as cannabis vaping products and edibles) as of October 17, 2019. Conclusion: While the total number of cases of ARs associated with legal cannabis products submitted to HC have increased across reporting periods, other variables have remained stable or have decreased. Health Canada will continue to monitor and analyse trends in cannabis ARs and publish these results in future years. References/Further Sources of Information Not applicable.""",1.0,case,True

Diarrhea is mentioned in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of rivaroxaban, but not for apixaban and edoxaban. However, a significant number of reports about diarrhea associated with the use of apixaban have been reported to the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb. Besides the spontaneous reporting system (SRS), Lareb performed a cohort event monitoring (CEM) study on the safety profile of NOACs in daily practice. Both systems could provide other types of information regarding signal detection in pharmacovigilance. Objective: To explore how combined data from the Dutch SRS and a CEM study on NOACs can be used to analyze the possible association between diarrhea and apixaban. Methods: The SRS included reports of possible adverse drug reactions (ADRs) spontaneously reported by healthcare professionals and patients to the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre. The CEM study included 1133 NOAC users, of which 339 apixaban users, who had been followed for 6 months after start of the NOAC. During this period, they received 4 questionnaires about possible ADRs. Results: The SRS included 18 reports of diarrhea associated with apixaban. In 7 reports the time to onset (TTO) was reported (median 5 days). Four reports out of these 18 mentioned a positive dechallenge. The CEM study included 7 cases of diarrhea.

Objective: To observe the utilization of AHA laboratory tests and incidence of AHA cases in Tuscany region during 2017-2021 and compare the rate of AHA in patients tested for AHA during COVID19 immunization campaign (2021) with that observed in 2019-2017. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed using population-based administrative data from Tuscany region (3.7million inhab), Italy.

Cumulative annual incidence of both patients tested for AHA and possible AHA cases was respectively calculated. The rates of incident AHA cases on patients tested for AHA observed in 2021 and in 2017-2019 were calculated. All estimates were standardized by age and sex (std.). 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated with Poissons method (statistical difference ,"" no 95% CIs overlap). Results: A total of 126 possible AHA cases and 1.081.878 incident patients with C 1 laboratory test for AHA were identified between 2017 and 2021. Calendar year 2020 was clearly non-representative of the pre-immunizazion campaign period due to pandemic waves, thus it was excluded from the analyses. In 2021, std. incidence of tested patients (6067/million inhab/year; 95% CI 60412-60913) and std. Incidence of possible AHA cases (5.6/million inhab/year; 95% CI 3.4-8.7) showed the lowest point estimates, though only the former was statistically significant compared to any other year of the observation period. The std. rate of possible AHA cases on patients tested for AHA in 2021 was 5,6/100milion (95% CI 3.4-8.7) was not statistically different from that observed in 2017-2019 (7.6/100milion; 95% CI 5-11). Conclusion: No increased incidence of possible AHA cases during the COVID19 immunization campaign was observed in Tuscany. Findings from this study do not suggest neither a possible detection bias nor a possible safety signal. Notority of other known vaccineinduced coagulation disorders may explain the increased reporting of AHA following COVID19 vaccines. References/Further Sources of Information""",1.0,vaccine,True

3832,"Introduction: Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) represent effective strategies to maintain treatment adherence in patients with chronic schizophrenia [1]. Among the second generation LAIs (SGALAIs), paliperidone palmitate (PP) is available as one- (PP1M) and 3-month (PP3M) formulations. These newer formulations seem to be effective, safe and well tolerated [2]. However, real-world studies regarding the safety and tolerability profile of PP1M and PP3M are few and mostly conducted on small samples. Objective: To better understand the safety and tolerability profile of PP, with a focus on PP3M. Methods: We analyzed the Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) publicly available on EudraVigilance. ICSRs uploaded between 2011 and 2021, presenting PP1M and PP3M as suspected drugs were evaluated. ICSRs relative to LAI formulations of aripiprazole, olanzapine and risperidone reported between 2003 and 2021 were also examined as reference group. ICSRs derived from literature were excluded. Data were evaluated with a descriptive analysis, then, as disproportionality measures, crude reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Chi2 tests were also performed to compare ICSRs characteristics between PP1M and PP3M. Results: A total of 7.836 ICSRs were retrieved. Of those, 6.095 (77.8%) presented as suspected drug PP1M and 1.655 (21.1%) PP3M, while 86 ICSRs indicated both PP formulations as suspected drugs. The majority of ICSRs regarded male patients (n , 4.616; 58.9%) in the 18-64 years age group (n ,"" 5.079; 64.8%). After grouping the observed adverse drug reactions into System Organ Class (SOC) terms, the most frequently detected ones were ``Psychiatric Disorders'' (n "","" 2.817; 19,5%), ``General disorders and administration site conditions'' (n "","" 2.493; 17,3%) and ``Nervous system disorders'' (n "","" 1.867; 12,9%). The disproportionality analysis showed significant values for the SOCs ``Reproductive system and breast disorders'' (ROR "", 1.17; 95% CI 1.04-1.30) and ``Endocrine disorders'' (ROR , 1.45; 95% CI 1.21-1.73). The sub-analysis conducted using Chi2 showed increased reporting frequencies for PP3M over PP1M regarding the SOCs ``Psychiatric disorders'' [n , 772 (27.9%) vs n , 2.011 (17.5%); p \ 0.001] and ``General disorders and administration site conditions'' [n , 602 (21.8%) vs n ,"" 1.862 (16.2%); p \ 0.001]. Conclusion: Our analysis shows that the safety and tolerability profile of PP, while being similar overall to those of the other SGA-LAIs, could present differences in key areas for tolerability such as the endocrine system. Furthermore, some differences in the ICSRs reporting pattern between PP1M and PP3M seems to emerge from this analysis. References/Further Sources of Information""",1.0,Case,True

3841,"Introduction: Increasing evidence highlights the allergenic potential of pegylated drugs as a result of the production of anti-PEG immunoglobulins [1-3]. Objective: To investigate the risk of hypersensitivity reactions of pegylated drugs using the Italian spontaneous adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting system database (SRS). Methods: We selected ADR reports attributed to medicinal products containing pegylated active substances and/or pegylated liposomes from the Italian SRS in the period between its inception and March 2021. As comparators, we extracted ADR reports of medicinal products containing the same non-pegylated active substances and/or non-pegylated liposomes (if not available, compounds belonging to the same mechanistic class). A descriptive analysis of all ADR reports, and of hypersensitivity reactions specifically, was carried out. Reporting rates and time to onset of hypersensitivity reactions for each medicinal product were also calculated. As a measure of hypersensitivity reactions reporting disproportionality, we also calculated the reporting odds ratio. Furthermore, the relationship between the proportion of hypersensitivity reactions for the study drugs and their PEG size was assessed. Results: Overall, 3,865 ADR reports were related to pegylated medicinal products and 11,961 to their non-pegylated comparators. Concerning both overall ADRs and hypersensitivity reactions reports, around two-thirds of patients were females and they mostly concerned patients aged between 46 and 64 years. The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions reporting was higher among pegylated vs. nonpegylated medicinal products (11.7% vs. 9.4%, p \ 0.0001) and the proportion of serious hypersensitivity reactions was two times higher for pegylated vs. non-pegylated medicinal products (33.0% vs. 16.3%; p \ 0.0001). The hypersensitivity reaction reporting rates were always higher for pegylated vs. non-pegylated medicinal products, with reporting rate ratios ranging from 1.4 (95% CI 0.8-2.5) for pegfilgrastim vs. filgrastim to 20.0 (95% CI 2.8-143.5) for peginterferon alpha-2a vs. interferon alpha-2a. The median time to onset of hypersensitivity reactions ranged from \ 1 day and 69 days for pegylated medicinal products, and from \ 1 day and 345 days for non-pegylated comparators. Disproportionality analysis showed that both pegylated and non-pegylated medicinal products were not associated with an increased reporting trend of hypersensitivity reactions. Moreover, higher PEG molecular weights were not statistically associated with an increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction reporting. Conclusion: Although disproportionality analysis showed that neither pegylated nor non-pegylated medicinal products were associated with an increased hypersensitivity reactions reporting trend, findings of",1.0,,True
