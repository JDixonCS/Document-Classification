9,"Purpose: To determine and compare the prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms in 2010 and 2021 in an adult population living in Stockholm at start of participation, Sweden, and study the possible impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.",1.0,pandemic,True
10,"Methods: Data were used from 2010 (n,""6,641) and 2021 (n"",""8,863) based on a longitudinal population-based study with the aim to study risk and protective factors for mental health. Self-reported depression was assessed using Major Depression Inventory and in 2021 questions on effects of the Covid-19 pandemic were added. Prevalence was calculated and presented with 95% confidence intervals.""",1.0,protective,True
11,Results: Depression and depressive symptoms had increased in 2021 compared with 2010. The highest prevalence was found in women and in the youngest age-group. There was no difference after adjusting for Covid-19 infection in any of the age-groups. Women who experienced life changes related to the pandemic situation had higher rates of depression as well as those who lost their job during the pandemic.,1.0,pandemic,True
12,"Conclusion: During the Covid-19 pandemic, it seems both depression and depressive symptoms become more common. However, we did not find support for a direct effect related to a Covid-19 infection but our results suggest that part of the increase may be due to secondary social and economic consequences of the pandemic.",1.0,pandemic,True
13,Introduction,0.0,,False
14,"Many well-known risk factors for depression increase during a pandemic, both due to actual infections and to imposed restrictions of everyday life. Postinfectious reactions, financial insecurity, job stress and decreased social network are amongst them. These stressors, and the degree they affect people, are most likely different in different countries, groups, and individuals.",1.0,pandemic,True
15,"Many studies, including several systematic reviews and meta-analyses, have recently been published showing an increased rate of depressive symptoms, as well as depression, during the Covid-19 pandemic. The pooled prevalence of depression has varied greatly between studies; from 16 to 45%. The highest rate was found in a meta-analysis only including patients (n,""5,153) suffering from Covid-19, the lowest were reported in a study mixing many different study samples (n"",""189,159) [1, 2]. A systematic review and metaanalysis including 68 cross-sectional studies (n"",""288,830) from 19 countries, reported a higher risk among women. Other associated factors were younger age, living in rural areas and having lower socio-economic status. However, a substantial heterogeneity for most of the associations were found [3].""",1.0,pandemic,True
16,"In general, most of the studies are from China most likely since the outbreak started there. Additionally, most of the studies used the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) as measure of depressive symptoms and depression diagnosis was defined using cut-off scores. Most of the studies focus on direct effects of Covid-19 infection on the individuals but there are also studies of the effects of the lockdowns. A meta-analysis including 25 studies (n,""72,004) specifically focusing on the effects of lockdowns reported that the psychological impact was small in magnitude and highly heterogeneous, suggesting nonuniform detrimental effects on mental health and that most people were psychologically resilient [4].""",1.0,outbreak,True
17,"Concerning the effects of how the stringency of lockdowns affects the prevalence of depressive symptoms a meta-analysis reported that the prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms was significantly lower in countries where governments implemented stringent (the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Index) policies more promptly [5]. However, again here most of the included studies were from China. There were two included Swedish studies, one which included only elite athletes [6] and the other one was a cross-sectional study (n,""1,212) of persons recruited online using PHQ-9 as depression measure showing a prevalence of 30%. There were no gender differences, and poor self-rated health, and previous history of mental health problems were associated with depression [7].""",1.0,clinical,True
18,"In summary, several studies have been done showing high rates of depression during the pandemic. However, most of the studies have been limited to PHQ-9 and to a Chinese context. Since a validation of PHQ-9 using a structured clinical interview in a primary care population revealed that a PHQ-9 score of 10 or higher had good sensitivity but poor specificity in detecting major depression [8].",1.0,pandemic,True

24,"Data was based on a longitudinal population-based study of mental health, work, and relations: PART (In Swedish: Psykisk hälsa, Arbete och RelaTioner), among adult people living in the Stockholm County, Sweden at time of inclusion. So far four waves (w) have been conducted: 1998-2000 (w1), 2001-2003 (w2), 2010 (w3) and the most recent in 2021 (w4). At each wave, subjects who agreed to participate, answered a questionnaire sent by mail or administered online. The original study sample at baseline in 1998 included 19,742 adult individuals 20-64 years of age residing in the Stockholm County and randomly selected from the Total population register. 10 441 individuals responded at w1 (53%). Non-response analysis was performed using available official registers. Participation was related to female gender, higher age, higher income, and education, being born in the Nordic countries, and having no previous psychiatric diagnosis in the hospital discharge register or in the early retirement register [9]. All participants from the first wave received a second, almost identical questionnaire at w2 and the participation rate was 83%. Attrition in the second wave was associated with the same conditions as in the first wave. In w3 this was repeated (participation rate 61%) with the addition that 4,956 persons aged 20-30 was invited (participation rate,""22%). In w4, a similar procedure was used as in w3, and 10,158 individuals from w1 participants were invited (participation rate 73%) with an additional sample of 4,986 young adults aged 20-30 (participation rate 33%).

A question on duration of symptoms was added in the questionnaire and only symptoms reported to have lasted at least 2 weeks were included. Validity studies of the MDI has been performed using the PART study and in clinical settings in European countries [11, 12, 13].

Other variables were assessed based on the questionnaire. Employment status was grouped into employed, retired/early retired, study, break from work or study (e.g. parental leave, and study leave), and other (e.g. jobless, and long-term sick leave). History of Covid-19 infection were self-reported. Covid related work changes were assessed using the responses to the following questions: ""During the period from the beginning of the Covid19 pandemic until now, did your work situation change in any way?"" The participants were grouped into lost job, changed job, no change, not applicable based on their answers. The Covid-related change in private life was assessed based on the following question ""During the past month, how much disturbance has the covid-19 pandemic caused in your daily life?""

551,In the present study Major Depression and depressive symptoms were more common (45% increase) in 2021 compared with 2010. The highest prevalence was found in the youngest age-group years and in women all in agreement with previous studies.,0.0,,False
552,"Older adults are at higher risk for severe infection and death due to Covid-19, but they have also been found to have lower risk of posttraumatic symptoms suggesting a higher resilience towards stress [14]. Other studies have also shown a lower risk of depression in this age group during the pandemic [15]. We found no relation between being infected by Covid-19 and higher rates of depression. Since its most likely that most of the persons in this sample did not have a severe infection, it is not possible to compare with studies using hospitalized samples. However, higher rates of depression were associated with women who experienced disturbances in their private life related to the pandemic situation. Higher rates were also found in those who lost their job during the pandemic. Thus, some of the increase might be due to secondary social and economic consequences of the pandemic.",1.0,pandemic,True
553,"A report in Lancet 2021 by the Covid-19 Mental Disorders Collaborators estimated an additional 53.2 million (44.8 to 62.9) cases of Major depressive disorder globally (an increase of 27.6% [25.1 to 30.3]) due to the Covid-19 pandemic [16]. The meta-analysis included 46 studies from around the world. Most of the included studies used symptom scales, which was considered using a bias correction. This bias correction assumes that the predictive validity of the symptom scales remained the same pre-pandemic and mid-pandemic. They also concluded that some of the symptoms might be reactive to the situation and not a part of a disorder.",1.0,case,True
554,"However, there is evidence of an increasing trend of depression even before Covid-19 pandemic. A recent review by Moreno-Agostino concluded that this increase is not due to methodological changes within or across studies [17]. They excluded studies with different sampling procedures or depression assessments across time points. The study also highlights the absence of research on the changes in incidence of depression over time using the same sampling methods and depression assessments across time points.",1.0,pandemic,True
555,The 45% increase of depression seen in the present study was mainly driven by the younger persons (20-39 years) but also partly explained by an increased prevalence in the elderly. Although the prevalence was higher among women the relative increase was higher among men. One explanation could be that it is not being a woman rather the expression of femininity that increases the risk [18]. Acknowledging and expressing the feminine side might be more accepted in recent years. Depression might have different expression in women and men and rating scales might capture the feminine rather than the masculine expression [19].,1.0,,True
556,Page 8/10,0.0,,False
557,"There is a possibility that the high numbers reported in the studies included in the Lancet review will decrease after the pandemic. Wellbeing theories suggests that because of genetic and personality predispositional factors, subjective well-being is stable over the long term [20, 21]. Thus the 45% increase might be explained both by a pandemic related effect and a time-trend.",1.0,pandemic,True
558,"Strength of our study include the population-based, longitudinal design and use of validated assessment of depression, which is rare in the Covid context. Several limitations must also be acknowledged, oneThis might affect the external validitu being the non-participation rate. Participation might be related to Covid-19 infection as well as depressive symptoms, causing an underestimation. During the pandemic restrictions in Sweden have been relying partly on recommendations since trust in the government is high (67% in 2020- data from OECD). This might affect the external validity.",1.0,pandemic,True
559,"However, a recent review and meta-analysis including 36 studies comparing pre and peri-Covid-19 data on anxiety and depression reported that age, status as a medical provider, race, or region of origin, had no impact on elevated levels of symptoms during the pandemic implying that the results could be applicable even in other settings [22].",1.0,pandemic,True
560,"In summary, the increase in prevalence of depression in 2021 compared to 2010 could be due to the overall increasing rates of depression in society but we cannot rule out an effect of the pandemic either.",1.0,pandemic,True
