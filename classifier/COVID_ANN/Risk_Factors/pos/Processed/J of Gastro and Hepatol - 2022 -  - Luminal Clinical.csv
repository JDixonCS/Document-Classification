5,"Case report: A 63-year-old man presented with epigastric discomfort, early satiety for 6 months, and no history of weight loss. His past medical history included hypertension, depression, and dyslipidemia, and he was taking hydrochlorothiazide, desvenlafaxine, atorvastatin, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). He had a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, which showed a nondistended stomach and grossly thickened wall of the stomach (Fig. 1A). There was no evidence of infiltration of the adjacent fat and no upper abdominal lymphadenopathy. Subsequently, an upper endoscopy showed Los Angeles Grade B reflux esophagitis and diffuse giant gastric folds from the fundus to the distal body of the stomach (Fig. 1B). Gastric biopsies showed a prominent oxyntic gland component, which was apparently expanded by several small cystic oxyntic-type glands and focally by pyloric-type small cystic glands. The features were akin to a cystic fundic gland polyp but extensive. Intestinal metaplasia was not seen. Only rare plasma cells were noted in the lamina propria, which was mildly edematous, but features of a true inflammation were not seen. Helicobacter pylori was not seen. The epithelial cytological atypia/dysplasia or neoplasia was not seen. He was booked for an endoscopic ultrasound, which again found diffuse wall thickening of the fundus and the body of the stomach (Fig. 1C). This appeared to be primarily thickening within the submucosal layer. The gastric wall measured up to 20 mm in thickness. Fine needle biopsy was performed with a 22-G needle. Histopathology again showed a similar appearance to the gastric biopsy from biopsy forceps. Conclusion: The clinical impression was that this was most likely Ménétrier disease; however, the histopathological features were not typical of that entity. Ménétrier disease is generally characterized by foveolar hyperplasia, which was not present in this case. Chronic PPI use could produce this histological pattern; however, not with this radiological finding. A repeat CT abdomen scan at 12-month follow-up also showed similar features.",1.0,Case,True

7,"Introduction: Pancreaticopleural fistula is a rare complication from acute pancreatitis, which could be treated surgically but with technically challenging and variable outcomes. This case study reports a patient with pancreaticopleural fistula who was managed with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with a good outcome. Case report: A 35-year-old man presented with increasing shortness of breath and was found to have a large left-sided pleural effusion on chest X-ray. His past medical history included recurrent acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol misuse. He has been admitted a month earlier with abdominal pain and mild dyspnea; initially, computed tomography (CT) showed a multiloculated pancreatic pseudocyst and collection in the mediastinum and retrocrural space associated with bibasal pleural effusions. He had recovered with conservative management and was discharged. Repeat CT on this admission showed rupture of the pseudocyst, which caused communication with the pleural space and led to complicated loculated left-sided pleural effusion (Fig. 1A). Diagnostic thoracentesis was performed, and the pleural fluid showed high lipase and amylase levels, consistent with a pancreaticopleural fistula (lipase, 53 900 U/L; amylase, 56 570 U/L). Subsequently, a left intercostal catheter was inserted to drain a large pleural effusion, and ERCP was performed. During ERCP, a pancreatogram confirmed a disrupted duct of the main pancreatic duct at the body of the pancreas (Fig. 1B). Therefore, a 7-Fr 15-cm straight pancreatic plastic stent was placed across the main pancreatic duct (Fig. 1C). He improved clinically after ERCP, the pleural drain was removed, and he was discharged home. The pancreatic stent was removed 6 months later, and a follow-up CT scan showed no pancreatic cyst and complete resolution of the pleural effusion. Conclusion: ERCP could be a good option to consider for a patient with pancreaticopleural fistula and disrupted pancreatic duct.",1.0,case,True

Biopsy of the rectal mass and rectal mucosa showed ischemic-appearing large bowel mucosa with necrotic ulcer slough material. The patient was stable with conservative management; however, he had ongoing bleeding during the hospital stay. His Hb level dropped to 66 g/L, WCC to 20.4 × 109/L, and platelets to 730 × 109/L, and repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy after 6 days showed severe necrotic-looking mucosa with dusky-looking mucosa extending from the anus up to 30 cm above the anal verge (Fig. 1C). The colonoscope was unable to be advanced beyond the abnormal mucosa due to a high risk of perforation. No obvious mass was found. Repeat biopsy also indicated severe ischemic necrosis of the bowel mucosa. Subsequently, the patient had high-volume rectal bleeding and had emergent abdominoperineal resection and ureterocolic anastomosis, complicated by breakdown of the right ureterocolic anastomosis with free intraperitoneal fecal and urine contamination, which required laparotomy, division of adhesions, ligation of the right ureter, and revision of colostomy.

27,"Introduction: Splenic injury is a rare complication following endoscopic procedures, especially endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Here, we report a case of splenic injury after an EUS with fine needle biopsy for gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Case report: A 41-year-old man presented with mild epigastric pain. He had an upper endoscopy, which showed mild gastritis and a 4-cm gastric subepithelial lesion at the gastric antrum (Fig. 1A). Gastric biopsies showed chronic gastritis, negative for Helicobacter pylori. Biopsy samples were also taken with biopsy forceps at the subepithelial lesion, which were nondiagnostic. After initial upper endoscopy, the patient was well, and his epigastric pain resolved with a proton pump inhibitor. Subsequently, EUS was booked to assess the gastric subepithelial lesion. EUS showed a 45mm, well-defined, hypoechoic lesion, with a heterogeneous texture, originating from the muscularis propria, consistent with gastric GIST (Fig. 1B). The lesion also appeared to be exophytic. The echoendoscope was not advanced into the duodenum during the procedure, and fine needle biopsy was performed with a 22-G needle, with four passes. A computed tomography (CT) scan was organized after discharge (7 days after EUS) to assess the size, anatomy, and morphology of the lesion. The patient was well after the procedure and discharged home; however, he developed left-sided abdominal pain in the evening and presented to the emergency department at another hospital. He was given pain relief, the pain improved, and he was discharged home after observation and without any investigation. The pain lasted for 3 days and completely resolved. At outpatient follow-up 14 days after EUS, the CT scan was reviewed and showed a 3.8 × 5.5 × 4.9-cm exophytic mass at the gastric antrum, extending upward and abutting the left hepatic lobe surface, likely a gastric GIST. CT also showed splenic laceration with perisplenic hematoma and hemoperitoneum (Fig. 1C). At this review, he appeared well, his blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, heart rate was 85 beats/min, and abdominal examination was unremarkable. The histopathology showed a spindle cell neoplasm that suggested GIST. His hemoglobin (Hb) level was 12.8 g/dL, which dropped from 16.4 g/dL, and a follow-up Hb level 6 days later was 13.5 g/dL. He was reviewed by the surgical team and scheduled for wedge resection of the stomach a month later. During the operation, the spleen appeared",1.0,case,True
28,"normal, with no fresh blood seen, and the stomach wedge resection was performed uneventfully. The final histopathology confirmed stomach GIST, which involved the submucosa, muscularis propria, and subserosal areas of the stomach wall. The tumor size was 6 cm in its greatest dimension. Mitotic count of tumor cells was 3 per 50 HPF, with free stomach resected margins. Immunohistochemistry confirmed gastric GIST (CD117, positive; smooth muscle actin, focally positive; DOG1, positive; desmin, negative; S100, negative). Conclusion: Splenic injury is an exceptionally rare complication after EUS. However, physicians should be aware of this complication and consider a CT scan if the patient experiences abdominal pain after the procedure.",1.0,area,True

Methods: We selected sequential patients with reflux symptoms and IEM (distal contractile integral [DCI] <450 mmHg.s.cm) from our existing database of previously analyzed patients. We assessed liquid (5 mL of normal saline × 10), viscous (5 mL of standard bolus medium × 5), and solid (saline-soaked 2-cm3 solids × 5) bolus clearance during manometry (MMS Solar, Unisensor 32, 1-cm spaced pressure and 16 2-cm length impedance segments). Multiple rapid swallowing (MRS) response was tested using 5 × 2-mL normal saline swallows. Bolus clearance was regarded as intact if 80% of liquid and 70% of viscous/solid boluses displayed a drop below and return above 50% of baseline impedance for all impedance sensors through the esophagogastric junction (EGJ). Patients were excluded if studies were incomplete or if clearance was incongruent between consistencies.

40,"Background and Aim: Current data on esophageal motility disorders in ageing are conflicting, with some historical studies showing increased achalasia or spastic motility disorders in older patients (Ribeiro et al. 1998), while others observed no differences when comparing with younger patients (Robson and Glick 2003). High-resolution manometry studies have shown no differences for older patients, defined as 65 years or older (Nakato et al. 2017, Shim et al. 2017). We aimed to compare the outcomes of motility studies across age cohorts. Methods: We selected studies performed for dysphagia, chest pain, or typical reflux symptoms between 2015 and 2019. Incomplete, postsurgical studies in patients under 20 years of age or studies done for other indications, including atypical reflux symptoms, were excluded. Patients were studied in right lateral posture using MMS Solar high-resolution impedance manometry: 32/36 pressure at 1 cm, 16 impedance 2 cm length (MMS/Unisensor, Laborie). Each patient received 10 × 5 mL of normal saline 0.9% liquid, 5 × standard viscous bolus medium upright (Trisco Foods), and 2 × 2-cm saline-soaked bread boluses upright. Data were reported according to the prevalent Chicago Classification of distal esophageal motility at the time (V3.0).

44,"Background and Aim: Bacteremia and infective endocarditis (IE) are serious conditions that have high associated mortality and morbidity. Evidence suggests a correlation between colorectal cancer and IE. Colonic organisms, such as Streptococcus bovis, may induce cancer through the stimulation of inflammatory cytokines or increased carcinogens.1 This inflammation may also increase vascular permeability, allowing gut microbe translocation.2 Another hypothesis suggests that primary mucosal changes from colorectal malignancy may lead to increased bacterial translocation and systemic infections. Changes in local conditions and disruption of capillary channels may allow certain bacteria, such as S. bovis/ Streptococcus equinus complex, in particular, and S. bovis biotype I and II, to enter the bloodstream.3 Mucosal changes from infective colitis and chemotherapy-associated colitis can result in bacterial translocation and increased risk of systemic infections.4 It is unknown whether large, precancerous colorectal lesions (LPCL) may also be associated with an increased risk of bacteremia and IE. This was a pilot study aimed at determining the prevalence of preceding bacteremia and IE in patients who underwent endoscopic resection of LPCL.

54,"Background and Aim: Cold snare polypectomy (CSP) is the standard of care for resecting small (<10 mm) colonic polyps. However, there are limited data for its efficacy for medium-sized (10-19 mm) sessile polyps. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of CSP/cold endoscopic mucosal resection (C-EMR) for medium-sized sessile colonic polyps. Methods: We conducted an Australian prospective multicenter study between May 2018 and June 2021, including all consecutive cases of CSP/C-EMR for 10-19-mm sessile colonic polyps. Once resection was deemed complete, the margins of resection sites were biopsied circumferentially and centrally. Primary outcome was the presence of residual polyp in these biopsy specimens. Secondary outcomes were recurrence rate at first surveillance colonoscopy and rates of adverse events. Results: CSP/C-EMR was performed for 350 polyps in 295 patients. Median polyp size was 15 mm. Submucosal injection to lift polyps was used in 305 polyps (87.1%). Histology showed that 68.5% of polyps were adenomas, 26.2% were sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/Ps) without dysplasia, 3.8% were SSA/Ps with dysplasia, and 1.4% were hyperplastic polyps. For the primary outcome, margin and central biopsies were positive in six polyps (1.7%) and one polyp (0.3%), respectively. For secondary outcomes, polyp recurrence was present in four cases (1.7%) at first surveillance colonoscopy that had been completed for 225 polyps (64.2%) at a median interval of 9.7 months. Adverse events occurred in 10 patients (3.4%): one had intraprocedural bleeding (clipped), three had self-limiting postpolypectomy bleeding, four had postpolypectomy pain, and two had postpolypectomy syndrome. There were no perforations. Conclusion: CSP/C-EMR for 10-19-mm sessile colonic polyps is highly effective and safe.

Methods: We used an anonymous online questionnaire for basic physician trainees who successfully completed examinations between 2019 and 2021. Results: We had a total of 85 respondents. Our survey showed that, of the 53% of female respondents who considered pursuing gastroenterology, 76.6% did not apply for the training program.

More than half of the respondents agreed that equity and gender issues exist in gastroenterology training, particularly the lack of support to access maternity leave and flexible work hours. More than half (57.5%) emphasized the importance of role models and mentorship as a factor that would help them select gastroenterology as a career. Conclusion: Our results highlight the need to raise awareness of the issues faced by women during training. This is an important step to allow trainees to make their desired choice without barriers and to increase the proportion of women selecting gastroenterology as a preferred specialty.

67,"Background and Aim: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is characterized by partial replacement of the normal squamous epithelium of the esophagus with columnar epithelium containing goblet cells due to prolonged acid regurgitation. This condition requires long-term endoscopic surveillance because it is the only identifiable premalignant condition that predisposes to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), an aggressive form of malignancy with a low survival rate (<20% overall survival at 5 years). The Australian BE clinical practice guidelines have recommended regular endoscopic surveillance to identify dysplastic BE and early-stage EAC (Fig. 1), thereby improving survival outcomes. However, these recommendations have not been evaluated in the Western Australian population. Therefore, we aimed to share the experience of launching the Western Australian Barrett's Oesophagus Registry (WABOR) to provide clinical and epidemiological information. Methods: Toward the registry launch, the steering committee discussed the following methods between 2020 and 2021: determining key data sources, including hospital databases, pathology, data quality, and the ease of extraction from WA health systems; estimating epidemiological indicators of BE, describing the burden of the disease, and identifying knowledge gaps in diagnosis and management using linked data; and establishing the WABOR to monitor disease trends and facilitate research trials. We focused on the challenges in clinician engagement, diverse research ethics, and governance approvals. A data collection form based on the data elements of the International BE Registry was developed to be incorporated into REDCap, a secure online data capture platform. Results: We enlisted 15 hospitals (nine public and six private), one pathology department, and one tertiary university in the Perth metropolitan area of WA, expecting to prospectively recruit more than 1000 patients with BE per year.

68,"Background and Aim: The Lyon Consensus has outlined various esophageal pH-impedance parameters in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).1 pH-impedance testing is not widely available, and several symptom-based questionnaires have been developed to aid in the clinical diagnosis of GERD. GerdQ, a validated questionnaire for detecting GERD, is commonly used but has only been validated using a pH-only study.2 Evaluation of GerdQ in pH impedance is limited. Our aim was to investigate whether GerdQ can predict abnormal pH-impedance testing. Methods: Consecutive adult patients referred for refractory reflux were included in the study. Patients with prior foregut surgery or major motor disorders detected on esophageal manometry were excluded. All patients completed the GerdQ and ROME IV questionnaires for upper gastrointestinal symptoms. A GerdQ score of 8 is considered positive for GERD. All patients then underwent 24-h pH-impedance study after proton pump inhibitors and/or H2 receptor antagonists were withheld for at least a week. The following parameters were recorded, according to published guidelines: total acid exposure time, total reflux events, weak acid reflux events, mean nocturnal baseline impedance, and symptom association probability. Associations between GerdQ and pH-impedance parameters were assessed using bivariate and multivariate analyses where appropriate. Results: A total of 103 patients (aged 50 ± 14 years) were included. There was no association between positive GerdQ and positive acid exposure time (P ,"" 0.32) when compared with those with negative GerdQ. Similarly, there was no association between positive GerdQ and abnormal mean nocturnal baseline impedance (P "","" 0.28), total reflux events (P "","" 0.24), or weak acid reflux events (P "", 0.31). There was also no association between positive GerdQ and positive symptom association probability to acid or weak acid reflux (P , 0.69).

84,"Background and Aim: Low resting (basal) lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure is a mechanism associated with the severity of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Measurement of basal LES pressure during manometric procedures has routinely been performed in the left lateral or supine posture. More recently, the updated Chicago Classification scheme (CCv4.0) for esophageal motility disorders expanded the protocol to include an upright test position for this metric. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of posture on basal LES tone and its relationship with total 24-h acid exposure time in patients referred for esophageal function testing. Methods: Patients consecutively referred to the motility laboratory for esophageal high-resolution impedance manometry (HRIM) studies (MMS system; Unisensor catheter with 32 pressure, 16 impedance) with additional 24-h ambulatory pH (dual 10) monitoring were included in the study. The HRIM protocol included 10 × 5-mL thin (IDDSI 0) liquid boluses (SBM Kit, Trisco Foods) in the left lateral posture, followed by five times 5-mL liquid boluses while seated upright. Two baseline periods of 30 s were also performed in both postures to capture the basal LES pressure.

Results: A total of 37 patients (age, 57 ± 3 years; 11 male) were included. Abnormal total AET (GERD) was identified in 15 patients (40%). In this group, basal LES pressure was reduced in both postures when compared with patients with normal 24-h AET (left lateral: 11.3 ± 1.9 mmHg vs 18.4 ± 2.2 mmHg, P < 0.02; and upright: 8.1 ± 1.8 vs 16.2 ± 2.5 mmHg, P < 0.01).

The diagnostic criteria for IEM remain contentious and have been redefined with the recent reiteration of the Chicago Classification.

Methods: Patients who underwent high-resolution manometry (HRM; Trace 1.3.3) and 24-h pH-impedance study (Digitrapper, Medtronic) at Royal North Shore Hospital, a tertiary center in Sydney, Australia, between 2010 and 2020 were included. The new Chicago 4 criteria were applied to these studies. Study results, including acid exposure time (AET) and symptom association percentage (SAP), and demographic data were collected. Statistical analysis was performed using the software R. Results: A total of 1267 patients were captured in the 10-year period. The overall prevalence of IEM was 11% (145/1267; 66% female). There were 494 patients (64% female) identified as having normal motility who were included in the analysis. As expected, patients with IEM had a significantly lower percentage of normal swallows during the HRM procedure, compared with patients with normal motility (15% vs 77%, P < 0.001). There was an overlap of patients with IEM and functional disorders. Of the 145 patients with IEM, 24 (17%) had reflux hypersensitivity, and 45 (33%) had functional heartburn.

Patients with IEM had a significantly increased average AET compared with those with normal motility (13.7% vs 7.5%, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Patients diagnosed with IEM have a significantly higher AET, compared with patients with normal motility. This confirms existing literature that acid reflux plays a role in the pathophysiology of IEM or manifests as a consequence of this disease entity.

164,"Background and Aim: In Australia, a third of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnoses occur late, with a CD4 count of less than 350 cells/L. An estimated 11% of people with HIV are unaware of their diagnosis, with undiagnosed and untreated HIV infections resulting in increased morbidity and an increased risk of infecting others. Esophageal candidiasis is an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining diagnosis, and HIV testing for affected patients is recommended in Australian and international guidelines. We aimed to audit adherence to this policy in the Tasmanian Health Service Southern Division (THS-S) to determine the frequency of HIV testing in patients with a histological diagnosis of esophageal candidiasis between 2019 and 2021. Methods: We conducted a retrospective clinical audit of the THS-S digital medical record (DMR). All patients histologically diagnosed with esophageal candidiasis after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy between 2019 and 2021 within the THS-S were included. DMR and Sonic (private pathology provider) databases were then interrogated to determine what proportion of patients underwent HIV testing and the results of testing. Additional data points included medical conditions associated with immunosuppression, inhaled corticosteroid use, indication for endoscopy, subdiscipline of medical practitioner responsible for ordering the HIV test, and follow-up and management after diagnosis. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data collected. Results: A total of 25 patients were identified as having a histopathological diagnosis of esophageal candidiasis between 2019 and 2021 within the THS-S. Of these, 11 (44%) had HIV testing, but only two (8%) had an HIV test after esophageal candidiasis diagnosis. None of these tests were coordinated by the endoscopist, and no patient had an HIV test ordered at diagnosis or a testing plan documented. All HIV tests conducted returned a negative result. Of the 25 patients identified, 14 (56%) were using either immunosuppressive therapy or regular inhaled corticosteroids, and eight (52%) of these had undergone HIV testing at some stage. Eleven patients (44%) were not using any form of immunosuppressive or inhaled corticosteroid therapy, and, of these, only three (27%) had an HIV test. None of these tests were conducted after a diagnosis of esophageal candidiasis. Fourteen patients (56%) were treated (with either fluconazole or nystatin), and in most cases, follow-up occurred with a general practitioner. Conclusion: Esophageal candidiasis is an AIDS-defining diagnosis, and HIV testing is recommended for such patients in Australian and international guidelines. Our retrospective audit has shown that HIV testing does not occur routinely after a diagnosis of esophageal candidiasis and highlights the need to establish systems to improve routine HIV testing in those diagnosed with esophageal candidiasis.",1.0,clinical,True

166,"Background and Aim: Colonoscopy remains the cornerstone of bowel cancer prevention through the detection and removal of premalignant colorectal lesions and polyps. However, there is limited evidence about when to stop surveillance colonoscopy. Ongoing indefinite surveillance in the elderly might lead to diminishing survival benefits and increased risks of cardiopulmonary events, bowel perforation, and procedural complications. In 2019, the Australian Cancer Council issued guidance recommending that surveillance colonoscopy for people aged 75 years with a Charlson score of >4 should be ceased. We aimed to examine the implications and benefits of applying these rules to a cohort of patients aged 75 years undergoing colonoscopy. Methods: In this retrospective study, we reviewed a total of 250 colonoscopies performed in patients aged 75 years in a single tertiary hospital in Brisbane, Queensland, between January 2018 and May 2019. Procedures were then classified as surveillance for polyps, polyposis syndrome, or colorectal cancer, compared with diagnostic procedures for the investigation of clinical symptoms, abnormal imaging, fecal occult blood test (FOBT) results, or iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The cases were retrospectively analyzed using electronic medical records (IEMR) and the endoscopy database (ProVation MD). High-grade lesions (HGL) were defined as polyps 10 mm, adenomas with villosity or high-grade dysplasia, traditional serrated adenomas, sessile serrated lesions with dysplastic change, or malignancies. We also evaluated post-procedural complications, periprocedural admissions, readmission rates, and death within 2 years of follow-up after colonoscopy. Categorical data were analyzed using the 2 test of proportions. Results: A total of 100 surveillance colonoscopies were performed for polyp surveillance (n ,"" 64), polyposis syndromes, or prior colorectal cancer (n "", 36). There were 150 diagnostic colonoscopies performed for FOBT results (n ,"" 28), clinical symptoms (n "","" 81), IDA (n "","" 24), or abnormal imaging (n "","" 17). There was a significantly lower occurrence of HGL in the surveillance group compared with the diagnostic group (5% vs 22%, P < 0.05), including significantly lower rates of colorectal malignancies (1% vs 6.7%, P < 0.05). Within the diagnostic group, the rates of HGL were highest for FOBTs (39.3%), followed by IDA (30.8%), abnormal imaging (29.4%), and clinical symptoms (12.7%). There were more deaths within 2 years after colonoscopy (15.4% vs 2.62%, P < 0.05) and periprocedural hospitalizations (35.3% vs 20.2%, P < 0.05) in patients with a Charlson score >4 compared with 4. The rates did not vary according to surveillance vs diagnostic procedures. High rates of procedural complications (2.4%), periprocedural admissions (28.4%), and death within 2 years after colonoscopy (9.2%) were observed in patients aged 75 years, and this increased significantly with advancing age. Conclusion: Surveillance colonoscopy in patients aged 75 years is associated with a low yield of HGL and colorectal cancer. This cohort of patients has a high rate of morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with a Charlson score of >4. This supports the Australian Cancer Council guidelines on ceasing surveillance colonoscopy in this cohort.""",1.0,clinical,True

174,"Introduction: A variety of submucosal lesions can be found in the colon and are often an incidental finding. Most are benign, including lipomas, leiomyomas, and lymphoid aggregates. Malignant causes also exist, including neuroendocrine tumors and metastatic lesions. Soft lesions generally represent lipomas, confirmed by a positive ""pillow sign."" However, accurate diagnosis of a firm submucosal lesion requires histological assessment. We present a case of a rare benign firm submucosal lesion discovered on colonoscopy. Case report: A 53-year-old woman underwent gastroscopy and colonoscopy for investigation of iron deficiency anemia. She had no history of weight loss and a normal bowel habit. Gastroscopy was unremarkable. At colonoscopy, one 3-mm firm submucosal nodule was found in the proximal ascending colon (Fig. 1).This was resected en bloc using a cold polypectomy technique. No other abnormalities were found. Histology showed a well-defined lesion in the mucosa and submucosa composed of abundant histiocytes admixed with small numbers of lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, and rare eosinophils. Many of the histiocytes contained characteristic Michaelis-Gutmann bodies, which were periodic acid-Schiff positive (Fig. 1). Conclusion: Malakoplakia is a rare granulomatous disease that can involve many organ systems. The exact pathogenesis is poorly understood but is thought to be related to impaired macrophage ability to phagocytose bacteria, leading to formation of pathognomonic Michaelis-Gutmann bodies.1 It is mostly seen in the genitourinary tract but can also occur rarely in the gastrointestinal tract.

He had a previous left inguinal hernia repair at the age of 14 years, but no other medical conditions. He reported no use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication. Laboratory testing confirmed an ongoing iron deficiency anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 91 g/dL and ferritin level of 20 g/L. His inflammatory markers were not elevated. Gastroscopy and colonoscopy once again showed no abnormalities. A CT abdominal scan showed fecal loading, with no findings of bowel obstruction, and an oblong calcification in the lower pelvis consistent with an enterolith. To further investigate his symptoms, a video capsule endoscopy was performed. Abdominal X-ray done in the setting of capsule retention showed the video capsule almost abutting the enterolith on the right side of the pelvic cavity (Fig. 1). Retrospective review of the CT scans suggested that the enterolith is likely located in an MD, which displayed a thick-walled narrow neck, raising the possibility of ectopic gastric mucosa within the diverticulum. Diagnostic laparotomy found a broad-based MD containing a palpable enterolith, with adjacent small bowel obstruction, which was resected, and the video capsule successfully removed. Histology confirmed MD with a stricture immediately distal to the diverticulum. His postoperative recovery was uneventful, and he remained well at follow-up 2 weeks later. Conclusion: This unique case of video capsule retention secondary to stricture distal to an MD illustrates the importance of considering MD as a differential diagnosis in younger adults presenting with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.

233,"Introduction: Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare systemic vasculitis of small to medium vessels, with key characteristics of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and raised peripheral blood eosinophilia. It is estimated that there is gastrointestinal involvement up to 78% of the time, and it has been associated with higher mortality. Given the rarity of the disease, there have been few documented reports of EGPA with small bowel involvement. We report a case of a patient who had documented small bowel involvement and remained in remission with mepolizumab. Case report: A 32-year-old woman presented with severe abdominal pain on a background of eosinophilic asthma and a history of resolved myopericarditis. Her regular medications included 4-weekly mepolizumab 100 mg, sertraline 100 mg daily, inhaled glycopyrronium daily, and inhaled budesonide/eformoterol twice daily. She reported an 18-month history of episodic severe, crampy, generalized abdominal pain associated with bloody diarrhea and significant weight loss. Routine investigations showed an elevated white blood cell count of 18 × 109/L (neutrophil count, 5.9 × 109/L; eosinophil count, 7.6 × 109/L), negative antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and a raised C-reactive protein level of 96 mg/mL. Fecal microbiology tests (including viral, parasitic, and bacterial panels) were unremarkable. The fecal calprotectin level was mildly elevated (110 g/g).

242,"Background and Aim: Although it is generally accepted that surveillance of nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus (BE) is important to identify progression to dysplasia, it is unclear what the most cost-effective strategy is for surveillance. Mutation or aberrant expression of p53 has been identified as a risk factor for the development of dysplasia in BE. We sought to determine if surveillance intervals for BE could be stratified based on p53 expression. Methods: A patient-level discrete time cycle Markov model was developed to model clinical surveillance strategies for nondysplastic BE. Patients entered the model following a diagnosis of nondysplastic BE. All patients underwent p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) on biopsy samples. Patients with nondysplastic BE with abnormal p53 expression underwent surveillance endoscopy in 1 year, while patients with normal p53 expression underwent surveillance in 3 years (Fig. 1).1 Patients with nondysplastic BE and abnormal p53 expression, patients with low-grade dysplasia with abnormal p53 expression, and all patients with high-grade dysplasia underwent endoscopic therapy for dysplasia. Monte Carlo deterministic analysis was performed over 10 000 iterations and over a 40-year patient time horizon. Health-related quality of life data were used to determine quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Point estimates used published clinical probabilities. Results: On base case analysis, the strategy of stratifying surveillance based on abnormal p53 IHC was more cost-effective (cost, A$8049.96; effectiveness, 14.38 QALYs) than conventional surveillance (A$8683.49; 14.30 QALYs) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of À4357.21 for conventional surveillance, highlighting that the abnormal p53 surveillance strategy dominated the conventional surveillance strategy.

The median rectal diameter measured was 11.5 cm (IQR, 9.4-12.1) (Fig. 1), and five patients (63%) had coexisting IMC with evidence of both rectal and colonic distension. The most common presenting symptom was constipation (88%), followed by bloating (75%) and fecal incontinence (63%). All patients had required prior sustained periods of regular fleet enemas, and seven of eight (88%) were using ongoing oral aperients. Five patients (63%) had concomitant anxiety and/or depression, and two patients (25%) were diagnosed with an intellectual disability. Concurrent genitourinary dysfunction was present in two patients, one of whom required a suprapubic catheter. Health care utilization was high, with a median of three emergency department presentations or inpatient admissions related to IMR per patient during the follow-up period (IQR, 1-5). Six patients (75%) had outpatient specialist gastroenterology follow-up. Six patients (75%) received pelvic floor physiotherapy with behavioral biofeedback training, and five patients received outpatient psychiatry input. Five patients (63%) had medically refractory disease requiring manual disimpaction during their clinical course, and three patients (38%) underwent definitive surgical intervention.

289,"Background and Aim: Foreign body ingestions can be categorized as food bolus or true foreign bodies. True foreign body ingestion is more common in the pediatric population. In adults, foreign body ingestion is more common in patients with underlying psychiatric comorbidity, the elderly, those with alcohol intoxication, and prisoners. The vast majority of ingested foreign bodies pass through the alimentary tract without complication. However, 10-20% of cases require endoscopic retrieval, and about 1% require surgery due to complications or failed endoscopy. The aim of this study was to review the management of prisoners presenting with true foreign body ingestion to a single tertiary hospital that holds the prison contract for the state and to compare management with current best practice guidelines. Methods: We undertook a retrospective review of prisoners presenting with foreign body ingestion to a tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Victoria, from January 2017 to December 2021.

Almost all presentations (98%) underwent radiological evaluation on admission, with most (83%) having plain radiographs, in keeping with best practice guidelines. The most commonly ingested objects were miscellaneous items (e.g., TV/radio parts, pens, and cutlery) (50%), batteries (23%), razor blades (12%), and alleged drug-containing balloons (12%). High-risk foreign body ingestion--defined as ingestion of sharp objects, objects with a length >6 cm or diameter >2.5 cm, batteries, and/or magnets--occurred in about 50% of cases. For all foreign body ingestions, conservative management, defined as inpatient or outpatient observation, was the most common approach for 58%; no complications occurred in this cohort despite a third presenting with high-risk ingestions, suggesting this approach is safe in the appropriate clinical context. Those with high-risk ingestions that were managed conservatively were frequent presenters, with a median of 11 presentations, and had multiple endoscopic procedures before the decision for conservative management was made. Patients undergoing endoscopy were more likely to have high-risk ingestions compared with patients receiving conservative management (67% vs 33%, P ,"" 0.001). A third of patients undergoing endoscopy had low-risk ingestions, which may have been amenable to conservative management. The median time to endoscopy for patients with high-risk foreign bodies located in the stomach was 19 h, which is within the recommended 24-h time frame. The median length of stay (LOS) for all foreign body ingestion presentations was 2 days and did not differ between patients receiving intervention versus endoscopic management (median, 2 vs 2 days). LOS did not differ based on management approach for patients with low-risk ingestion (median LOS: conservative, 2 days vs endoscopic, 2 days; P "","" 0.64) or high-risk ingestion (median LOS: conservative, 2 days vs endoscopic, 2 days; P "","" 0.18).

Conclusion: It is common for prisoners to present with foreign body ingestion, and about 50% present with high-risk foreign body ingestion. For patients with low-risk foreign body ingestion, conservative management is safe. High-risk foreign body ingestion can also be safely managed conservatively for appropriately selected patients. LOS was similar between conservative and endoscopic management, which likely reflects other factors, including access to endoscopy and observation periods.

The median follow-up period was 15 months (IQR, 7.9-21.6). Technical success was achieved in all cases. Six of 157 SSLs had evidence of cytological dysplasia. Overall, recurrent SSLs were detected in three cases (1.92%; 95% CI, 0.6-5.9%) at a median interval of 10 months (IQR, 9-12) after resection, including one of seven cases with conventional EMR. Among patients treated with CS-EMR, the SSL recurrence rate was 1.32% (95% CI, 0.3-5.3%). Recurrent SSLs were completely resected at first surveillance colonoscopy, with no further residual lesions detected at second surveillance procedure. SSL size, location in colon, trainee involvement in the procedure, EMR technique, and presence of cytological dysplasia were not associated with risk of incomplete resection.

301,"Background and Aim: The Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) provides a 24-h emergency aeromedical retrieval (AMR) service, including primary evacuation and interhospital transfer, for people requiring medical attention in rural and remote Australia.

Such data could assist the design of targeted clinical support to identify high-value transfers and enable other patients to safely remain in regional areas. Methods: We performed a retrospective audit of clinical outcomes after AMR at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, South Australia's largest public tertiary referral center.

302,"discordant. Where insufficient information was available, they were judged ""indeterminate."" Admission streams were categorized as surgical, hepatological, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), general gastroenterology, or nongastrointestinal. In-hospital diagnostic tests were noted and scored as to whether they were necessary to confirm the diagnosis. In-hospital management was categorized as either ""interventional"" (surgery or procedural) or ""conservative."" Interventions were subcategorized as endoscopic (colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP], or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion), general surgical, other surgical procedure (nongastrointestinal), or a combination. Length of stay was demarcated categorically as <1, 1-3, 4-7, 8-14, or >14 days. Discharge destination and 1-year survival rates were also recorded. Results: A total of 1060 patients undergoing AMR with in-flight gastrointestinal diagnoses were included in the final analysis. The median patient age was 62 years (IQR, 47-74), and 55.9% of patients were male. More than a third of retrievals originated from the Eyre Peninsula region, with other common source regions including Yorke Peninsula (24.4%), the Murray Mallee region (10.2%), and the Northern Territory (6.8%). The majority of patients (57.0%) were admitted under gastrointestinal surgical teams. A substantially smaller proportion of patients were admitted under hepatology (6.0%), IBD (1.9%), and general gastroenterology (10.1%). A quarter of patients were admitted under nongastrointestinal specialties, including nongastrointestinal subspecialty surgery, cardiology, renal, and general medicine. The most common diagnosis was biliary disease, accounting for 14.6% of all gastrointestinal retrievals. Other common diagnoses included bowel obstruction (12.2%), upper gastrointestinal bleeds (7.2%), pancreatic disease (6.7%), and appendicitis (6.1%). Most patients (65.5%) had a hospital diagnosis that was concordant with the in-flight diagnosis, compared with 23.1% that were discordant. Pathological investigations (chemical/tissue pathology) were performed almost universally in the cohort (94.7%), and most also had radiological investigations (75.8%). Just over half of those undergoing AMR required a surgical or endoscopic procedure during admission (52.8%), with the most common procedures being gastrointestinal surgery (18.2%), ERCP (9.8%), and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (9.6%). The largest proportion of AMR patients had a length of stay of 4-7 days (34.1%), and almost a third (32.3%) had a length of stay of >8 days. Conclusion: Encouragingly, the hospital discharge diagnosis and in-flight RFDS diagnosis were concordant a large proportion of the time. A large proportion of patients appear to benefit greatly from their transfer, with most undergoing surgery or endoscopy.

317,"Introduction: Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common symptomatic primary immunodeficiency, characterized by a reduced serum level of immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, and/or IgM, with lack of specific antibody production. It is a multisystem disorder, with gastrointestinal involvement occurring in 9-22.4% of cases. The absence or lack of plasma cells is the most common feature found, in up to nearly 50% of histology samples. The small intestine is the most commonly affected area, reported with histological features indistinguishable from those of celiac disease.1-3 We present a case of noninfectious small bowel CVID enteropathy to highlight both diagnostic and management challenges. Case report: A 37-year-old man with a diagnosis of CVID presented with frequent diarrhea associated with 10 kg of weight loss over the past 2 years. His disease manifestation included hepatosplenomegaly secondary to CVID-associated granulomatous inflammation. Stool microscopy and culture did not identify an infectious cause. Initial gastroscopy showed scalloping of the duodenum, with evidence of subtotal villous atrophy on histology. Colonoscopy was unremarkable. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing was positive for HLA-DQ8. With the absence of serum IgA, a clinical diagnosis of celiac disease was made based on endoscopic findings and HLA typing. The patient was educated about gluten-free diet (GFD). Repeat gastroscopy in a year continued to show features consistent with untreated celiac disease. Strict dietary education was again emphasized. Despite a full-adherence diet, he needed loperamide for ongoing symptom control. Blood markers showed micronutrient deficiencies, including vitamins A, D, E, and K and iron. An interval repeat gastroscopy showed persistent scalloping of the duodenum. Further histopathological evaluation was requested, with confirmation of notable absence of plasma cells. This prompted revision of the diagnosis to noninfectious CVID-associated enteropathy. He failed to respond to treatment with mycophenolate, rifaximin, and oral budesonide. Treatment was subsequently escalated to intravenous 8-weekly infliximab, with a drastic reduction in symptoms. Despite symptom control, repeat gastroscopy 3 years into the",1.0,symptomatic,True

Of note, the known granulomatous inflammation appears stable, as suggested by interval assessment of biochemical markers and positron emission tomography imaging. Conclusion: Small bowel CVID enteropathy shares similar histological findings with celiac disease. These are likely sequelae of immune dysregulation, rather than gluten sensitivity. Introduction of GFD with subsequent histological improvement would be the definitive way to diagnose celiac disease. HLA genotyping may be useful in identifying suitable candidates for GFD in this population. The most common histopathological feature aiding diagnosis of CVID enteropathy would be the lack of plasma cells, and this can be found up to 83% of patients with small bowel in CVID.4 This case highlights the importance of a timely re-evaluation of histology samples in patients with a high index of clinical suspicion. There is a lack of treatment options available for CVID enteropathy. The use of infliximab was first described in a small case series of three patients, with two having small bowel involvement.5 We saw the same treatment outcome, with clinical improvement in weight and frequency of stool and lack of changes in small bowel histological pattern after treatment. In addition, our patient also had benefit from concurrent treatment for granulomatous inflammation. CVID remains a polygenic complex condition, with a monogenic form thought to account for only 2-10%.6 Case series have highlighted the potential interplay of specific genetic defects with treatment response. This was seen in a case series of seven patients treated with vedolizumab, with two patients bearing mutations of BACH2 and NFKB1 developing acute decompensation.7 Our patient's initial genetic analysis showed multiple mutations on a primary immunodeficiency panel, but he declined further detailed genetic analysis owing to financial constraints. CVID enteropathy continues to be a challenging entity to diagnose and manage, due to its clinical, histopathological, and genetic heterogeneity. Unlike inflammatory bowel disease, there is a lack of real-world data for the definition of treatment success for CVID enteropathy and whether ongoing surveillance is required, given the refractory nature of histology changes. Further large-scale, good-quality studies are required to determine the necessity of surveillance programs and effective treatment options.",1.0,disease,True

332,"Introduction: Neoplasms of the appendix are rare, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 100 000 people. They account for only 1% of intestinal neoplasms. Patients may present with symptoms of appendicitis, a palpable mass, intussusception, and/or an incidentally discovered mass on abdominal imaging or at laparotomy for another purpose.1 A malignancy is found in about 1% of appendectomy specimens. Appendiceal neoplasms comprise several different subtypes, which can be broadly classified as either epithelial (70%) or neuroendocrine (30%) neoplasms.2 Epithelial lesions can be further subdivided into mucinous neoplasms and adenocarcinomas, each with their own unique precursor lesions and pathology. Adenocarcinomas of the appendix are histologically like adenocarcinomas of the colon and are thought to follow a similar adenoma-carcinoma pathway, whereas mucinous neoplasms appear to arise from a serrated pathway leading to dysplasia.3 Despite this, detection of precursor lesions in the appendix is rare during routine colonoscopy, as the entirety of the appendix cannot be fully visualized.4 Case report: An 81-year-old woman underwent a retrograde double-balloon enteroscopy for treatment of known colonic and small bowel angioectasia, on a background of recurrent iron deficiency anemia. At enteroscopy, she was found to have a Paris 0-Is lesion of about 20 mm arising from the appendiceal orifice with a Narrow Band Imaging International Colorectal Endoscopic (NICE) 2 surface pit pattern (Fig. 1A,B). Biopsy was performed, which showed features of a traditional serrated adenoma. The appendiceal orifice had been noted to be normal at retrograde enteroscopy 2 years prior. A subsequent computed tomography contrast scan of the abdomen showed an 18 × 17 × 43-mm appendiceal lesion protruding into the cecal lumen. Repeat retrograde enteroscopy was performed 5 months later for further treatment of small bowel angioectasia, where the appendiceal orifice was noted to be completely normal, despite no resection",1.0,Case,True

No invasive adenocarcinoma was identified. Conclusion: This case highlights the difficulty of detecting precursor lesions in the appendix, which can remain hidden even after reaching a significantly large size. This is particularly true for lesions involving the mid to distal appendix, as seen in this case. Diagnosis was fortuitous, as the appendix was likely inverted and protruding into the cecal lumen on index endoscopy. However, no indication of the lesion was apparent on endoscopy 5 months later.

346,"Background and Aim: Accurate assessment of patient-reported oropharyngeal dysphagia (OPD) is essential to guide appropriate management and evaluate its response. The Sydney Swallow Questionnaire (SSQ) is a paper-based 17-item inventory developed and validated to objectively assess OPD. An easy-to-use electronic questionnaire version with automated answer upload has significant potential to streamline remote patient assessment, especially in COVID-19-affected populations. The aim of this study was to develop an electronic version of the SSQ (eSSQ) and validate it against the original paper version. Methods: The eSSQ was translated from the paper version on the online REDCAP platform and developed to be accessible on computer and mobile devices. Recruited patients with OPD and asymptomatic controls completed both electronic and paper versions in randomized order. Patients with stable symptoms during the study period then repeated the eSSQ after 14 days for test-retest reliability. Agreement of total scores between both versions and eSSQ test-retest reliability were calculated using two-way mixed-effects intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: A total of 44 dysphagic patients and 32 controls were recruited. The most common underlying etiology for dysphagia was head and neck cancer. Mean eSSQ total score was 800 in dysphagic patients and 67 in controls. eSSQ had excellent agreement with the paper SSQ in total scores among all participants (ICC, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98-0.99) and in dysphagic patients (ICC, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-0.98), as well as excellent test-retest reliability (ICC, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.90-0.98). Conclusion: The newly developed eSSQ shows excellent agreement with the paper SSQ and test-retest reliability.

348,"Background and Aim: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) colitis is a serious complication of cancer immunotherapy. Despite treatment with corticosteroids, infliximab, and vedolizumab, refractory colitis may occur in some patients. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may be an effective treatment and is thought to target dysbiosis, although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated.1 This systematic review aimed to evaluate the patient profile and clinical/endoscopic response rates in patients with ICI colitis treated with FMT. Methods: A systematic search was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and Web of Science were searched using the search terms fecal microbiota transplantation, immunotherapy, and colitis/diarrhea, from commencement of the databases until May 2022. Search results were entered into EndNote. The Joanna Briggs Institute checklist was applied to evaluate the quality of the study and is included in the full text. Data extraction was independently performed and recorded in Microsoft Excel. Demographics, study design, outcomes, and safety profile were collected. Total response rate was analyzed using the binomial probability test, and response based on therapy type using Fisher's exact test. All analysis was performed using Stata 14.2. Results: The initial search returned 245 references. Of these, 76 duplicates were excluded, and an additional 147 were excluded on title and abstract review. For the remaining 22 studies, full text was obtained, and six studies were included in the review (Table 1). Two were case studies, and four were case series describing a total of 25 patients. Of the 25 patients included, nine (36%) were female, 11 (44%) had a genitourinary malignancy, and 13 (52%) were using combination ICIs. Sixteen patients (64%) had grade 3-4 diarrhea, and endoscopy was used in all but one patient on diagnosis. Of the 25 patients, 20 (80%) showed a clinical response, which was significant (P ,"" 0.0027). When response rates were compared based on use of single (response, 4/5) or dual (response, 3/3) ICI therapy, there was no significant difference (P "","" 0.625). There were no recorded complications of FMT. Conclusion: This systematic review shows that FMT is a safe and effective treatment for ICI colitis. A response rate of 80% for FMT in patients with refractory ICI colitis is substantial, although there was bias identified in all studies and further randomized controlled trials are required to confirm this. All cases identified were refractory to steroid and biologic therapy. Future research should address the response to first-line FMT therapy, as this has an appealing safety profile and in some studies has been shown to enhance tumor response to ICI.2""",1.0,clinical,True

439,"Background and Aim: Helicobacter pylori infects about 50% of the world's population. Manifestations range from mild gastritis to peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. H. pylori is an unusual bacterial pathogen in that treatment is empirical; culture and susceptibility testing are rarely performed. Current Australian H. pylori therapeutic guidelines recommend triple therapy, comprising amoxicillin (or metronidazole for those with a penicillin allergy) plus clarithromycin and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for 7 days, as first-line treatment. This is based on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) data that are now more than 20 years old. Rising AMR to H. pylori is a global concern; resistance rates to first-line treatment are about 25-61% and vary considerably geographically, prompting the World Health Organization to designate H. pylori as a high-priority AMR pathogen, alongside other resistant organisms such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore, there is an urgent need for local epidemiological data to guide treatment recommendations. Successful H. pylori eradication has been used as a surrogate for AMR, where a success rate of <85% is recognized to represent high primary AMR, necessitating review of antibiotic recommendations. Recent H. pylori isolates from Melbourne showed extremely high AMR rates,1 and, when compared with other similar laboratory data, resistance rates have been increasing over the past 20 years. However, as H. pylori culture and susceptibility testing are rarely performed, these isolates are likely to have originated from patients in whom eradication therapy has previously failed. The aim of this study was to perform a retrospective analysis at a single tertiary hospital to evaluate the success rate of first-line H. pylori eradication therapy as a surrogate for AMR in patients with confirmed H. pylori infection. Methods: Patients who tested positive for H. pylori on gastric biopsies between 2010 and 2021 at our tertiary center were identified from pathology databases. Only patients who received first-line treatment with amoxicillin or metronidazole plus clarithromycin and a PPI, without prior history of treatment of H. pylori, and who had subsequent confirmation of successful eradication (either with 14C urea breath test or on repeat gastric biopsy) were included. Results: A total of 216 H. pylori-positive patients received documented first-line eradication therapy and had a treatment outcome. Median patient age was 59 years (IQR, 47-70), 40% were male, 6.9% had penicillin allergy, and 1% had macrolide allergy. Of the 216 patients, 201 (93%) were prescribed amoxicillin-based triple therapy, and 15 (7%) were prescribed metronidazole-based triple therapy. Importantly, no patient had H. pylori culture and susceptibility testing before commencing empirical therapy. Of these 216 patients, only 147 (68%) had successful eradication confirmed on subsequent 14C breath test or repeat gastric biopsy; this is well",1.0,disease,True

441,"Background and Aim: Patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) presenting to specialist care have a high prevalence of psychological comorbidity. There is evidence that psychiatrists and psychologists can provide effective treatments for these disorders; however, health services rarely deliver this care in an integrated manner. This study aimed to characterize the patients engaging with psychiatrists who were integrated into a gastrointestinal clinic managing FGIDs and to examine the psychiatrists' effect on clinical outcomes. Methods: In a single-center, multidisciplinary gastroenterology clinic comprising gastroenterologists, psychiatrists, dietitians, gut hypnotherapists, physiotherapists, and specialist nurses, medical record data were retrospectively collected for patients with an FGID who were seen by a psychiatrist. Patient data collected included demographics, medical and psychiatric history, treatment history, history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), and adult trauma. Data on 12 ACEs, under the categories of abuse, neglect, and household challenges (adapted from the CDC-Kaiser Permanente ACE study), were collected. Adult trauma included abuse, disasters/accidents, discordant relationships, serious life-threatening illness, and death or sickness of a loved one (adapted from the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5). Symptom and psychological outcomes were assessed based on documentation at time of clinic discharge. Global gastrointestinal symptom improvement was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. Results: A total of 97 patients (median age, 35 years; 77.3% female) were seen by the psychiatrist (median time of treatment, 2.53 months) between January 2017 and November 2021.

Methods: A retrospective audit evaluating all FGID outpatient referrals accepted for waitlisting by a tertiary gastroenterology service in Adelaide, South Australia, between April 2015 and June 2021 was completed in June 2021. Referrals were assessed for completeness and appropriateness by a trained dietitian and gastroenterologist. Eligible referrals included those",1.0,clinical,True
451,"for adults aged 40 years with FGIDs for investigation and management in the absence of ""red flag"" high-risk symptoms that necessitate gastroenterology intervention. Study outcomes included the proportion of referrals that met HealthPathways recommendations for appropriate investigations and identification of patients who would be eligible for a diet-first FGID clinic, including wait times and referral reasons. Referrals were deemed complete if they contained a history of the presenting complaint and HealthPathways' recommended testing, including iron studies, vitamin B12 and folate levels, and celiac serology. Referrals were deemed appropriate if they limited uninterpretable or clinically irrelevant investigations, including carbohydrate breath testing, celiac genotyping, and excessive imaging, such as computed tomography (CT). Results: We completed retrospective assessment of 1873 referrals waitlisted by the gastroenterology department between April 2015 and June 2021. Of these, 64 referrals (3.4%) met inclusion criteria for a diet-first FGID clinic, the median wait time for which was 688 days (IQR, 457-1095). Referrals contained multiple presenting symptoms, including diarrhea in 30 (46%), abdominal pain in 31 (48%), constipation in 22 (34%), abdominal bloating in 17 (26%), and altered bowel habits in 12 (18%). Patients eligible for the diet-first FGID clinic were more frequently female (39, 61%), with a mean age of 30.5 years (95% CI, 29.2-31.8). Of those eligible for the diet-first FGID clinic, only 10 referrals (7%) met all HealthPathways recommendations. Key information was often inadequate for triage; only 22 referrals (34%) reported celiac serology, 18 (28%) reported iron studies, and 10 (16%) reported vitamin B12 and folate results. Excessive or redundant testing was also evaluated, with four referrals (6%) containing both celiac genotyping and serology, seven (11%) including carbohydrate breath testing, and four (6%) reporting CT imaging. Conclusion: Gastroenterology consultant waitlist times exceed SA Health recommendations. Recommendations for referral completeness and appropriateness to assist in effective triage and timely, safe provision of care have not been met, despite implementation of a HealthPathways framework for FGIDs. A diet-first FGID clinic is an effective, established model of care that could be concurrently implemented to reduce gastroenterology waitlists. It is estimated that a larger proportion than the 3.4% of 1873 referrals identified in the audit would be suitable for a diet-first FGID clinic, but it remains a challenge to identify these patients due to suboptimal referral quality. This audit has identified the importance of linking with primary health care providers to develop comprehensive referral pathways that could improve effective triage into a diet-first FGID clinic model of care.",1.0,clinical,True

Results: The rates of resistance were 81% for clarithromycin, 67% for metronidazole, 4.0% for amoxicillin, 0.5% for tetracycline, 21% for levofloxacin, 23% for moxifloxacin, and 15% for rifampicin (Table 1).

529,"Background and Aim: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications. Although a presumptive diagnosis of GERD can be made in the setting of typical symptoms (heartburn and regurgitation) and relieved by a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), ambulatory pH-impedance testing is recommended for patients with PPI-refractory symptoms, particularly in the setting of a normal endoscopy. Reflux is traditionally assessed by several pH-based criteria, including acid exposure time (AET) and symptom-reflux association indices. In addition, the post-reflux swallowinduced peristaltic wave (PSPW) index and the mean nocturnal baseline impedance (MNBI) have been shown to increase the diagnostic yield of reflux disease. However, their routine use in clinical studies remains to be established; this is particularly so for the PSPW index, which is hampered by a lack of automated analysis, requiring laborious manual analysis. We therefore aimed to determine the utility of PSPW index and MNBI in our cohort of patients and the potential for their future incorporation into our clinical practice. Methods: We prospectively collected and manually reanalyzed pH-impedance tracings from patients referred to the motility laboratory at an Australian tertiary referral center for suspected GERD from July 2021. Baseline demographic characteristics, AET, number of reflux episodes, PSPW index, and MNBI were collected. Cutoff values for PSPW index and MNBI were 61% and 2292 , respectively, as per previous published criteria.1 Outcomes were compared using Spearman's rank-order correlation. Results: We analyzed tracings from 100 consecutive patients, with a median age of 52.5 years (IQR, 37-64.25), 36 of whom were male. Fifty-two patients had an AET of >4%, and 35 (67%), and 50 (96%) had a pathological MNBI and PSPW index, respectively. MNBI and PSPW index inversely correlated with AET (R ,"" À0.655, P < 0.001; and R "","" À0.371, P < 0.001, respectively).

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has proven to be an effective treatment for recurrent CDI in multiple randomized controlled trials.1 FMT sourced from a bank of prescreened, anaerobically processed, frozen donor stool has been available in South Australia since 2013. The aim of this study was to evaluate the real-world clinical and safety outcomes of FMT for recurrent, refractory, and/or severe CDI facilitated via a centralized stool bank. Methods: The South Australian FMT for CDI database prospectively recorded outcomes for consecutive patients who underwent FMT for CDI from August 2013 to January 2022 in South Australia. Recurrent, refractory, and severe CDI were defined in accordance with Australian consensus guidelines for the management of CDI.2 Primary cure was no relapse of CDI within 90 days of initial FMT treatment. Secondary cure was no relapse of CDI within 90 days of repeated FMT treatment, following relapse after first FMT. Results: A total of 179 cases of CDI were recorded, with a median patient age of 69 years (IQR, 49-81). Ninety-day, 1-year, and 5-year follow-up data were available for 99% (177/179), 99% (152/154), and 95% (52/55) of cases, respectively.

545,"Background and Aim: The gluten immunogenic peptide (GIP) assay is a novel antibody-based tool that detects gluten in stool or urine. It provides an objective measure of gluten ingestion and has been proposed for use in detecting unexpected gluten exposure to inform gluten-free diet adherence more effectively than traditional measures, such as dietary history or celiac serology. However, it remains unclear how the GIP tool can be used in clinical practice to best inform patient care. We assessed stool GIP excretion dynamics in adults with treated celiac disease after they consumed cookies spiked with low doses of gluten to mimic ""real-world"" accidental gluten ingestion to assess their role in detecting intermittent, low-grade gluten exposure. Methods: We recruited 52 participants with celiac disease to undertake a 2-week run-in, then a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled gluten cookie (50, 250, 500, or 1000 mg) challenge. Stool GIP assessment, celiac serology, patient-reported symptoms, and dietary behavior were assessed before and after the challenge. Twelve of the 52 participants repeated the 2-week GIP assessment (without challenge) 12-24 months later to examine ""consistency"" of gluten intake/excretion in treated disease. Results: GIP was detectable after all gluten cookie doses (the following day for 92% of samples, after 2 days for 78%, and after 6 days for 33%) but not after placebo cookie. Gluten dose correlated with excretion duration (GIP detectable 6-151 h after 1000 mg and 22-71 h after 50 mg). Acute symptoms significantly increased after 1000 mg of gluten only. Vomiting was only observed after 500-1000-mg doses. Strikingly, before cookie consumption, one or more GIP-positive samples was found in 45/52 participants (85%) despite normal celiac serology (100%) and very good to excellent dietary adherence (73%). Rates of GIP excretion were highly concordant across the two assessments (mean, 16 months apart). Negative GIP was significantly associated with rarely eating food from hospitality providers (restaurants, take-away).",1.0,clinical,True
546,"Conclusion: Stool GIP assessment is more sensitive than dietary history and celiac serology to detect gluten ingestion. GIP detection is dependent on the gluten dose consumed and frequency of stool sampling. An important finding was the high GIP excretion rate in treated disease that is sustained over time in a seemingly clinically well and adherent cohort of patients with celiac disease. Dining out is an important risk factor for GIP excretion, suggesting cross-contamination is a major source of unintended gluten ingestion in our patients. The high sensitivity of GIP detection raises the dilemma that some positive results are not clinically significant. Data correlating GIP excretion to clinical endpoints, such as small intestinal mucosal disease, are required to appropriately interpret a positive GIP result.",1.0,disease,True

548,"Background and Aim: Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a common presentation to emergency departments (ED) that often necessitates admission and access to endoscopy. Australian data have reported the 30-day mortality rate to be as high as 10% in patients with variceal bleeding and 3% in those with a Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS) 3.1 In this single-center study, we sought to assess contemporary rates of 30-day mortality and causes of mortality in patients with UGIB presenting to a tertiary hospital over a 2-year period. Methods: All consecutive patients presenting to the ED with overt UGIB during a 2-year period (July 2016 to June 2017 and July 2018 to June 2019) were included in the study. The facility is a 929-bed tertiary referral hospital in Brisbane, Australia, which has an ED annual census of more than 77 000 presentations, a gastroenterology unit that performs more than 4000 upper endoscopies per year, and a 24/7 on-call service. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic data were available for all patients. Detailed electronic notes, including death certificates where available, were assessed to adjudicate causes of death. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Results: A total of 358 patients presented with overt UGIB during the study period. The median age was 55 years (IQR, 40-72), and 61.2% were male. Melena, hematemesis, and hematochezia as presenting symptoms were present in 56.5, 68, and 5.8% of cases, respectively.

Despite international societal endorsement, BE surveillance programs have not been conclusively shown to affect cancer-related mortality while coming at a significant health care cost. This is despite individuals with BE being at a 30 times greater risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma. A greater understanding of contributors to dysplasia development and progression may allow further risk stratification and rationalization of surveillance and management guidelines. Although the presence of a hiatus hernia has been established as a risk factor for BE development and poor response to therapy, its role in the development of dysplasia has not been clearly delineated. We aimed to address this by assessing the impact of the presence of a hiatus hernia on dysplasia incidence in a real-world population with BE. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of a prospective database of patients with histologically confirmed BE at a single tertiary hospital in Australia from 1999 to 2022. Baseline patient characteristics, including the presence and size of hiatus hernia and the length of BE, were recorded at the time of initial endoscopy. Subsequently, the results of further endoscopies, biopsies, and interventions were recorded. The data were analyzed to assess rates of dysplasia progression and esophageal adenocarcinoma development in patients in the presence or absence of a hiatus hernia. Dysplastic lesions were defined as the presence of low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, or adenocarcinoma. Data were tested for significance using Fisher's exact test. Results: A total of 535 patients with a median BE segment length of 3 cm were included in the study. Of these, 283 patients (52.3%) had a hiatus hernia (median size, 4 cm). At the time of index endoscopy, 17% of patients with a hiatus hernia (n ,"" 48) had a dysplastic lesion, compared with 10.3% of those without (n "","" 26) (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.06-2.97; P "","" 0.02).

Although the presence of a hiatus hernia has been identified as a risk factor for BE, its impact on the development and progression of dysplasia had not been clearly shown. Incorporation of the presence or absence of a hiatus hernia as a means of risk stratification may therefore improve the efficacy and efficiency of surveillance guidelines. In addition, this study lends support to the role for hiatus hernia surgery in patients with BE, although further research is required to establish the impact of hernia correction on dysplasia progression in these patients.",1.0,,True

562,"Background and Aim: COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020, due to its rapid spread and mortality rate. To limit the transmission of the virus, governments enforced measures such as social distancing, lockdowns, and closure of nonessential businesses and educational institutions. The social isolation and limited physical activity have been proposed to have caused weight gain in the general population, due to factors such as stress and emotional eating. The effect of the COVID-19 lockdowns on weight has been investigated in studies, but not specifically among gastroenterology patients. Anecdotally, gastroenterologists have observed that patients who visit their clinics report that they have gained weight during the pandemic. However, there has not been an objective assessment of weight gain. We therefore aimed to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient weight gain. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing endoscopy at a metropolitan tertiary referral center in the last 6 months of 2019 and 2021, thereby representing pre-pandemic and post-pandemic weights. Each patient's weight was recorded on the anesthetic record on the day of their procedure. We compared the mean weights of each group, as well as the change in weight of individual patients who had endoscopies in both 2019 and 2021 study periods. We used the 2 test and one-way ANOVA to compare baseline patient characteristics, independent t-test to compare means between groups, and paired sample t-test to compare individual patient weight changes. SPSS Statistics 28 and Prism v 9.3.1 were used for all statistical analysis. Results: Of the total 1397 patients who underwent endoscopy, 1354 had weights recorded (621 in 2019, 733 in 2021). In the 2019 cohort, there were 284 male patients (45.7%) and 337 female patients (54.3%), with a mean age of 59.3 years. Of these, 206 patients underwent gastroscopy (33.2%), 244 underwent colonoscopy (39.3%), 154 underwent both colonoscopy and gastroscopy (24.8%), and 17 underwent other gastroenterology endoscopic procedures (2.7%). In the 2021 cohort, there were 365 male patients (49.8%) and 368 female patients (50.2%), with a mean age of 57.8 years. Of these, 185 patients underwent gastroscopy (25%), 327 underwent colonoscopy (44.6%), 207 underwent both colonoscopy and gastroscopy (28.2%), and 14 underwent other procedures (1.9%).

A telephone survey was conducted to evaluate delayed (1 h to 14 days after infusion) adverse events and acceptance of the home-based iron infusion strategy. Patient acceptance was assessed with three questions on a 5-point Likert scale: ""How do you perceive the experience of having your infusion given in the home?"", ""Would you like to have the infusion in the same location if you require one in the future?"" and ""Do you feel safe having your infusion at home?"". Results: A total of 197 patients (114 female; mean age, 64 years [61-67]) who received intravenous iron at home were included, of whom 181 received ferric carboxymaltose and 16 received ferric derisomaltose. The most common comorbidities associated with iron deficiency with or without anemia included chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and cardiac failure. Mean hemoglobin level rose by 16 g/L (95% CI, 10-23; P < 0.001) when measured between 4 and 16 weeks after infusion. Mean ferritin level rose by 253 g/L (95% CI, 200-307; P < 0.001) when measured between 4 and 16 weeks after infusion. Seven patients experienced adverse effects: four immediate (flushing, pruritus, light-headedness, headache, bradycardia, hypotension) and three delayed (headache, rash, dysgeusia), with a median Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events score of 2 (range, 1-2). Two patients receiving ferric carboxymaltose experienced adverse events, compared with five patients who received ferric derisomaltose (P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). There were 58 patients who participated in the follow-up telephone survey about their experience of home-based administration of intravenous iron (53 who received ferric carboxymaltose and five who received ferric derisomaltose).

Methods: The novel BSGM system (Gastric Alimetry; Alimetry, New Zealand) employs a stretchable array (8 × 8 electrodes on a peel-and-stick patch; Fig. 1), coupled to a wearable reader device for measuring gastric electrophysiology. It is controlled via an app running on an iPad Mini to enable real-time symptom logging. Recordings were performed (30 min fasted, 4 h after meal) in patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms referred for gastric emptying scintigraphy. Analysis encompassed features of spectral and spatial electrophysiology (""Rhythm Stability Index,"" frequency, amplitude, and direction of gastric slow waves) to classify phenotypes, compared with a reference range of 100 healthy controls. Patients underwent simultaneous solid-meal (99mTC-labeled egg sandwich, 255 or 325 kcal) gastric emptying scintigraphy studies. Delayed gastric emptying was defined as >10% retention at 4 h, and rapid gastric emptying as <30% retention at 1 h. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Results: Of 53 patients, 41 were female, the mean age was 43.8 ± 2.3 years, and mean body mass index was 26.0 ± 0.8 kg/m2. Gastric emptying was abnormal in 13 patients (25% of all patients; 11 delayed, two rapid), whereas BSGM was abnormal in 22 patients (42%). BSGM disorders were classified into the following patient-specific phenotypes: neuromuscular disorder (Rhythm Stability Index <0.25) (12, 23%), abnormal frequency (2, 4%), and retrograde propagation syndrome (retrograde slow waves 25%) (8, 15%) (Fig. 2). Of the 31 patients (58%) with normal BSGM, five had delayed gastric emptying (9% of all patients, presumed gastric outlet resistance). Patients showing normal gastric function on both tests showed four distinct symptom patterns, as demonstrated in Fig. 2. Conclusion: BSGM offers a new diagnostic tool for assessing gastric motility.

608,"Introduction: Celiac disease affects 1-2% of the population and is the cause of villous atrophy in the vast majority of cases. Olmesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist that may rarely cause an enteropathy similar to celiac disease, both clinically and histologically, and has been well described in case series. We present a case of enteropathy induced by telmisartan (also an angiotensin II receptor antagonist) that was misdiagnosed as celiac disease and treated as such for 14 years. No other cases of telmisartan-induced enteropathy have previously been reported in Australia. Case report: A 72-year-old man presented in 2021 with a 14-year history of diarrhea and abdominal pain. His general practitioner suspected refractory celiac disease, as symptoms persisted despite the patient remaining on a gluten-free diet since diagnosis in 2007, at which time upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) showed villous atrophy. His past medical history included hypertension treated with telmisartan. In 2021, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, with duodenal biopsies showing intraepithelial lymphocytosis and marked villous atrophy. Celiac serology was repeated, and tissue transglutaminase and deaminated gliadin antibodies were negative (normal), and he did not express HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 alleles. Both history and investigations were inconsistent with a diagnosis of celiac disease, and he was advised to trial cessation of telmisartan. Three months later, endoscopic biopsies showed recovery of the duodenal mucosa. This histological recovery was reflected by the patient's clinical course, as he reported a significant reduction in symptoms. The diagnosis was revised from celiac disease to telmisartan-induced enteropathy. He reintroduced gluten into his diet and remains asymptomatic. Conclusion: Telmisartan-induced enteropathy is a rare entity. Most angiotensin II receptor antagonist-induced enteropathy is caused by olmesartan (94%), with other agents (telmisartan, valsartan, irbesartan, losartan, and eprosartan) collectively accounting for the rest.1 In Australia, the Therapeutic Goods Administration's Database of Adverse Event Notifications lists 25 cases of diarrhea potentially attributable to telmisartan; however, none (until now) have been formally diagnosed with villous atrophy on",1.0,disease,True

Secondary cancers to the SI more commonly include melanoma and lung, breast, and colon cancer.1 Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) rarely metastasizes to the SI, with a reported incidence of less than 1%.2 Case report: A 64-year-old man was evaluated for diarrhea, weight loss, and hypoalbuminemia in the setting of known metastatic RCC (to mediastinum). Disease stability had apparently been achieved with the multikinase inhibitor cabozantinib, and previous therapy had including doublet immunotherapy (ipilimumab and nivolumab). Results of blood tests showed anemia (hemoglobin, 94 g/L) with iron (ferritin, 5 g/L) and vitamin B12 deficiency, low albumin level (29 g/L), and negative celiac serology. Upper and lower endoscopy found only partial mild villous blunting on duodenal biopsies, of uncertain cause. Magnetic resonance enterography identified no SI abnormality. A VCE was arranged, which showed raised nodular lesions throughout the jejunum, with apparent mild ooze from one (Fig. 1). Background mucosa was also diffusely abnormal to about the mid ileum, with edema, swollen white tipped villi, and areas of complete mucosal denudation (Fig. 2). Histological diagnosis of metastatic RCC in the small bowel was confirmed with antegrade double-balloon enteroscopy (DAE) and biopsy. Further biopsies of the separate SI mucosa showed active inflammation, crypt apoptosis, edema, and focal lymphangiectasia. The enteroscopic and histological findings were suggestive of local lymphatic obstruction causing secondary intestinal lymphangiectasia and possible immunotherapy-related enteritis (related to previous therapy) that may in turn have contributed to SI protein loss. The patient was empirically treated with a tapering course of oral corticosteroids, which resulted in a sustained",1.0,Clinical,True

754,"Background and Aim: Achalasia cardia is characterized by spasm of the lower esophageal sphincter and disordered or absent esophageal peristalsis. The etiology is unknown; however, esophageal inflammatory infiltrates, including eosinophils, have occasionally been reported and proposed as causative. In recent years, peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has become increasingly recognized as a safe and effective treatment of achalasia. POEM allows for intraprocedural esophageal muscularis propria biopsy. We aimed to determine if an inflammatory infiltrate is present in the muscularis propria of the distal esophagus of patients with achalasia undergoing POEM. We considered patient demographics and comorbidities, with a focus on autoimmune and atopic conditions, as both have been implicated in the etiopathogenesis of achalasia. Methods: Patients diagnosed with achalasia (all subtypes) undergoing POEM were prospectively enrolled between 1 March 2019 and 10 May 2022. Patient age, achalasia subtype, and medical comorbidities were noted. Biopsy samples (four) were taken of the muscularis propria, proximal to and within 2 cm of the gastroesophageal junction, and placed in formalin. Samples underwent routine preparation in paraffin with subsequent HE staining. A single expert pathologist reported the findings and recorded the peak eosinophil count per high-power field (hpf). Results: Fifteen patients were included in this study. Demographics, achalasia subtype, relevant comorbidities, and histology on muscularis propria biopsy are summarized in Table 1. Nine patients (60%) were male. The youngest patient was 24 years old, and the oldest was 75 years, with a median age of 49 years. Of the achalasia subtypes, four patients (26.7%) had type I, six (40%) had type II, two (13.3%) had type III, two (13.3%) had type I/II, and one patient (6.7%) had type II/III. Eosinophils were present in the muscularis propria of eight patients (53.3%). Two patients were noted to have a florid eosinophilia (8 and 36 eosinophils/hpf, respectively; Table 1). Excluding these two patients, the remaining six patients with eosinophils recorded a median count of 1 eosinophil/hpf. Autoimmune comorbidities were documented in 50% of the patients. Of the female patients in the study, all had an autoimmune comorbidity, five (83.3%) had hypothyroidism, and one had psoriasis. One of the male patients had rheumatoid arthritis. Three patients (20%) had a history of asthma. Conclusion: The pathogenesis of achalasia is poorly understood, and it is possible that multiple disease processes are responsible and variably involved in individual patients. We recorded a florid eosinophilia in two patients and the presence of eosinophils in more than 50% of the patients with achalasia presenting for POEM.

We have previously presented limited data documenting a rising prevalence of EE and now consider a comprehensive overview of demographics and management. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review and interrogation of electronic medical records and histopathology databases using ICD-9/10 codes and appropriate keywords. Data were collected for clinical encounters between January 2008 and 31 December 2017 across seven tertiary pediatric hospitals in Australia and New Zealand: specifically in Adelaide, Auckland, Brisbane, Christchurch, Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney. Included patients were those aged 0-18 years who had EE according to esophageal biopsy, with >15 eosinophils per high-power field (hpf).

Results: The characteristics of patients and management patterns are shown in Table 1.

That patients of Polynesian and Middle Eastern racial background represent a sizeable proportion of cases in Auckland and Sydney, respectively, is a novel observation worthy of further study in what has been considered a disease of predominantly White Europeans.

773,"Background and Aim: Demand for public gastroenterology outpatient services often exceeds supply. Innovative alternative care models are required to increase the capacity of the public health system to provide more timely access for some patients. The aim of this study was to describe the activities and outcomes of an innovative multidisciplinary adult celiac outpatient clinic model, designed to improve access to timely diagnosis, and follow-up care, for patients with celiac disease (CD). Methods: A local care pathway for the management of adults referred for suspected CD commenced in May 2020 in a regional health service in Victoria, Australia. All referrals were directed to a multidisciplinary clinic managed by a celiac medical lead and a dietitian operating in an advanced practice role. To optimize gastroenterology resources, inputs were predominantly limited to the completion of endoscopy. Results: From May 2020 to May 2022, the clinic assessed more than 80 patients. Despite periods of disruption to endoscopy services due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the care pathway reduced average wait time for CD diagnosis from 18.0 (SD, 12.4) to 2.3 months (SD, 1.35). The clinic identified four cases of CD that were previously missed for the following reasons: inadequate gluten challenge before endoscopy, inadequate endoscopic duodenal biopsy samples taken, misinterpretation of a positive histological result with negative serological markers, and ordered celiac serology not reviewed. CD case finding has further been enhanced via the setup of an electronic pathology watch list that notifies clinic staff of all celiac serology pathology tests completed within the health service.

831,"Background and Aim: Colonic distension may activate multiple different gastrointestinal reflexes, affecting both colonic and upper gastrointestinal motility and increasing reflux events, which may trigger a variety of functional gastrointestinal and reflux symptoms. Medical therapy to decompress the colon provides a simple means to reduce symptoms. The degree of colonic fecal loading and gaseous distension is often not predictable based on a patient's bowel habit but is easily assessed with a plain abdominal X-ray (AXR). The aim was to determine the proportion of patients presenting with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) and reflux disease with excess fecal loading on AXR compared with historical controls and to assess whether this helps to predict symptoms and guide medical management more effectively than bowel habit history. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of 50 consecutive patients with reflux and functional gastrointestinal symptoms presenting to a gastroenterology practice with available AXR and at least one follow-up visit. Colonic fecal loading scores (CFLSs) with or without upper gastrointestinal gas trapping were assessed in a blinded fashion independent from the clinical history by a previously validated method. AXR scores and bowel habit history were compared as a means of predicting symptoms and the response to promotility therapy with laxatives and/or prucalopride/nizatidine. Patients were assigned an initial symptom score of 2. Post-treatment symptom scores were denoted as 2 (no change), 1 (50% improvement), and 0 (resolved). Results: Fifty patients (33 female, 17 male) aged 10-84 years presented, with both upper and lower gastrointestinal symptoms in 30, upper gastrointestinal symptoms (UGIS) in 16, and lower gastrointestinal symptoms (LGIS) in four. Pretreatment bowel habit was normal in 27 patients, constipation in nine, diarrhea in 10, and alternating constipation and diarrhea in four. The mean CFLS was 5.4 vs 4.33 in historical controls (P < 0.001). All categories of bowel habit had a higher CFLS than historical controls: normal (5.3), diarrhea (5.4), constipation (5.7), and alternating (6.0). CFLS was higher than in controls (at least 5+) in 37 patients (74%), yet only five of these patients gave a history of constipation (14%).

Forty-five patients with either a history of constipation or abnormal AXR findings were treated with laxatives ± prucalopride ± nizatidine. No patients commenced proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and pre-existing PPI doses remained unchanged or reduced. Nocturnal alginate-containing antacids were generally used in those with laryngopharyngeal reflux. Only four patients required reduction of some of the key dietary FODMAPs. Using a history of constipation alone to guide use of laxative therapy would have resulted in a drop in mean symptom score from 2 to 1.69, but using combined AXR and history to guide treatment reduced the mean symptom score from 2 to 0.62 (P < 0.001). As UGIS and reflux often reduced markedly following bowel lavage, and patients solely using laxatives ± prucalopride had significant improvement in symptom scores (13 patients, P < 0.05), colonic motility agents were considered to be the most useful component of treatment. All 50 patients were treated with laxatives ± prucalopride to improve functional gastrointestinal or reflux symptoms. After treatment, 46 of 50 patients (92% vs 54% pretreatment) had normal bowel habit, and only four had minor diarrhea (prior bowel habit: normal, 2; diarrhea, 2). Conclusion: Patients presenting with FGID and reflux have excess colonic fecal loading on AXR above the level of historical controls, regardless of bowel habit. Direct examination of AXRs is essential, as radiological reports frequently underestimate colonic fecal loading and gas retention. Treatment with laxatives ± prucalopride promotes more efficient colonic emptying and normalizes bowel habit in the majority of patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Excess total or proximal colonic fecal loading with associated upper gastrointestinal gas trapping is associated with functional upper gastrointestinal symptoms and reflux and may be a useful biomarker to guide treatment with promotility medications. Reducing colonic distension with laxatives ± prucalopride helps to reverse gastrointestinal motility reflexes, improves functional gastrointestinal and reflux symptoms without causing diarrhea, and highlights the important role of whole gut motility in FGID and reflux.",1.0,flu,True

Combining reflux scintigraphy with computed tomography/single-photon emission computed tomography (CT/SPECT) using a validated protocol provides a reproducible, noninvasive technique to accurately assess for pharyngeal and lung contamination. The aim of this study was to characterize pulmonary aspiration of refluxate in patients with LPR symptoms previously investigated with endoscopy and esophageal pH impedance by continuous pulse oximetry (SpO2) during the supine phase of a scintigraphic reflux study over 30 min.

841,"pump inhibitor therapy underwent fused three-dimensional scintigraphy/Xray computed tomography (CT) with continuous pulse oximetry when supine for 30 min. Variables including age, hiatus hernia, frequency of scintigraphic reflux, amplitude of reflux, area under the curve (AUC), liquid gastric emptying, RSI, cough severity index (CSI), Newcastle laryngeal hypersensitivity questionnaire (LHQ index), pulse rate, and changes in oxygen saturation were analyzed in aspirators vs nonaspirators. Panel data regression was applied to variables including pulse rate, age, sex, aspiration, hiatus hernia, amplitude, AUC, and frequency of reflux as potential influences on SpO2. Results: All 265 patients (40.4% male, 59.6% female) had evidence of pharyngeal contamination on scintigraphy. Less than 10% of patients experienced heartburn or had abnormal 24-h esophageal pH testing. Impedance studies revealed evidence of impaired bolus clearance and increased proximal upright and supine reflux compared with historical controls. Pulmonary aspiration was detected in 115 patients (43.4%), but none of the patients complained of dyspnea during the supine phase of the study. Seven patients had baseline oxygen saturations <95%, with 6/7 showing aspiration by scintigraphy and all having evidence of parenchymal lung changes on CT. The remainder had mean baseline saturation of 97.7%. The mean age of aspirators was 57.0 years vs 53.5 years for nonaspirators.

On bivariate analysis, hiatus hernia (P "","" 0.014), frequency of pharyngeal reflux (P "","" 0.02), and CSI (P "", 0.005) were significantly higher in aspirators than nonaspirators. Panel regression analysis showed a significant effect of age (P ,"" 0.009), hiatus hernia (P "","" 0.038), pulse rate (P "","" 0.006), aspiration (P "","" 0.049), and reflux frequency (P "","" 0.001) on fall in SpO2 over the period of assessment. Conclusion: LPR is a distinct gastrointestinal/respiratory disorder frequently not associated with typical acid reflux or heartburn. Reflux scintigraphy combined with CT/SPECT can reliably detect pharyngeal and lung contamination when other diagnostic modalities have been unhelpful. Pulmonary microaspiration is common in patients with LPR and associated with reduced oxygen saturations and potential chronic lung damage. The positive association of airway reflux events, pulmonary microaspiration, increased hypoxia, and evidence of chronic lung damage provides irrefutable evidence that LPR causes symptoms and potential laryngopharyngeal and/or lung disease through a direct reflux mechanism, rather than via secondary reflexes. Although impedance studies reveal useful trends to predict LPR, pH testing is unhelpful and highlights the role of low-volume weakly or nonacid reflux-generating symptoms and pathology in this condition.""",1.0,flu,True
