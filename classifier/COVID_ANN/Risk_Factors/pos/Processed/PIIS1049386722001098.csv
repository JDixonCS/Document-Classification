8,"Introduction: The predictors of heavy drinking among U.S. young women during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic are not well-examined. This study aims to determine the prospective relationship between COVID-19 psychological distress and heavy alcohol use among U.S. young adult women. Design: This study used the COVID-19 Adult Resilience Experiences Study (CARES) data collected from April 13, 2020, to August 31, 2020 (T1) and September 21, 2020, to March 15, 2021 (T2). Among the young adults (ages 18-30) who participated in both surveys, a total of 684 identified as women (including transgender women) were included in the analysis. Three or more drinks as a typical intake were defined as heavy drinking. Psychological distress in T1 was measured using scores for financial stress, COVID-19-related worry, and COVID-19-related grief. A series of logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors associated with young women's heavy drinking during the pandemic. Results: Twenty-two and one-half percent of young women reported heavy drinking in a typical intake. After controlling for covariates, women who reported high levels of COVID-19-related grief were more likely to report heavy drinking (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.13; p < .05). Those with high levels of COVID-19-related worry were less likely to report drinking heavily (odds ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.85-0.97; p < .01). Conclusions: Those who suffer from a deeper sense of COVID-19-related grief are particularly at risk of heavy drinking and should be targeted for outreach and clinical intervention. Further research is necessary to determine the long-term impacts of the pandemic on heavy drinking among young women and should include a more comprehensive assessment of psychological distress.

The financial cost of heavy alcohol use was estimated at approximately $249 billion in 2010 (Sacks, Gonzales, Bouchery, Tomedi, & Brewer, 2015).

Women's alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of having liver disease, breast and other cancers, and negative impacts on the brain and heart (CDC, 2020). Furthermore, heavy alcohol use in pregnant women can lead to a higher risk of stillbirth, miscarriage, and sudden infant death syndrome after birth (CDC, 2020). Despite documented gender differences in alcohol use, few studies have examined the specific factors associated with heavy drinking among women during the COVID-19 pandemic (CDC, 2020). Given the evidence that women are more susceptible to alcohol-related health consequences (Peltier et al., 2020), it is essential to investigate young women's risk factors for heavy drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic.",1.0,disease,True
20,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to an enormous amount of stress owing to the rapid transmission of the disease and its associated morbidity and mortality (Sharif Nia et al., 2022). Combined with the unpredictable nature of the disease, a number of COVID-19- specific distresses have emerged, including worries about the health of self and loved ones, increased fear of transmission, feeling a sense of loss and grief, and financial stress (Bertuccio & Runion, 2020; Lechner et al., 2021). The stress and coping hypothesis indicate that individuals often cope with stress with either adaptive or maladaptive behaviors (Cohen & Wills, 1985). Alcohol use may be a behavior that mitigates COVID-19-related distress. In fact, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a dramatic increase in alcohol consumption; the average number of drinks between February and April of 2020 increased by 29% (Barbosa, Cowell, & Dowd, 2021). Studies demonstrate that compared with men, women are more likely to drink in response to stress (Becker & Koob, 2016; Peltier et al., 2019), which is a concerning trend given that women are more vulnerable to experiencing pandemic-related psychological distress (Brooks et al., 2020; Taylor, 2019).",1.0,COVID-19,True
21,"Evidence showed that the pandemic exacerbated the gender imbalance in the division of labor such that women disproportionately absorbed the caregiving obligations for homeschooling their children as well as handled more domestic responsibilities. As a result, women were less able to contribute to the paid workforce (Stefanova, Farrell, & Latu, 2021). In May 2020, 11% of women faced underemployment compared with 7% of men (Golden & Kim, 2020). Additionally, women have endured more severe stress owing to health and childcare issues (Connor et al., 2020). As intimate partner violence increased during the pandemic, women were more likely to be victimized, placing their mental and physical well-being at risk (Lyons & Brewer, 2021; McNeil, Hicks, Yalcinoz-Ucan, & Browne, 2022). Studies suggest that, during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, a greater proportion of women compared with men exceeded their drinking limits through engaging in heavy drinking (Barbosa et al., 2021) and that women drank alcohol more frequently than men in general (Pollard, Tucker, & Green, 2020). Thus, a gender-specific approach to better understand the role of COVID-19 distress on young women's heavy alcohol use is warranted.",1.0,pandemic,True
22,"In this study, we hypothesized that three specific types of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic would predict women's heavy drinking. First, COVID-19-related grief may be linked to heavy drinking. During the pandemic, the loss of life, opportunities, and vital resources coupled with general uncertainties, all contributed to a collective sense of grief (Bertuccio & Runion, 2020). Drinking may be one coping mechanism used by individuals against unexpected losses and grief. Second, COVID19-related worry (e.g., fear of contracting COVID, being unable to maintain contact with loved ones) may also be associated with increased drinking. Rogers, Shepherd, Garey, and Zvolensky (2020) found that those who initiated using substances during the pandemic had greater COVID-19-related worry than those who never used substances. Finally, COVID-19-related financial stress may be a critical factor when considering that financial stress was also associated with alcohol-related problems during the COVID19 pandemic among U.S. adults (Rodriguez, Litt, & Stewart, 2021). Another study found that financial-related distress was the sole factor associated with an increase in risky drinking patterns over time among U.S. adults (Lechner et al., 2021).",1.0,COVID-19,True
23,"In addition, women's poor mental health statusdincluding the risk factors of depression and anxietydmay be associated with heavy drinking. Several studies found that preexisting mental health diagnoses and mental health problems (e.g., substance use disorders, anxiety, depression) were associated with elevated alcohol consumption during the pandemic (Capasso et al., 2021; Hansel, Saltzman, Melton, Clark, & Bordnick, 2022; Holmes et al., 2020; Pfefferbaum & North, 2020; Yazdi, Fuchs-Leitner, Rosenleitner, & Gerstgrasser, 2020). During the COVID-19 pandemic, high anxiety and depression were associated with increased drinking (Devoto, HimeleinWachowiak, Liu, & Curtis, 2022). Overall, those with a preexisting mental health diagnosis may be at greater risk for increased alcohol use. Last, loneliness may be another risk factor among young women during the pandemic. One multicountry study found that loneliness is strongly associated with high alcohol use among women during the pandemic, suggesting that alcohol is used to cope with loneliness (O'Sullivan et al., 2021).",1.0,pandemic,True
24,"Studies have generally demonstrated an association between these risk factors and heavy drinking. However, no published research is based on longitudinal data to understand the extent to which COVID-19-related distress (grief, worry, and financial stress) is associated with heavy alcohol intake after controlling for other risk factors among young women during the pandemic. This study uses the longitudinal data from the COVID-19 Adult Resilience Experiences Study (CARES 2020 Project) that tracked the cohort panel of young adults in the U.S. in 2020 and 2021 to document changes in their health and well-being over time. The objectives of the present study are to 1) estimate the prevalence of heavy alcohol use among U.S. young women and 2) determine the relationship between COVID-19-related distresses, mental health status, and loneliness during T1 and heavy alcohol consumption during T2 among U.S. young women. Understanding these potential factors will help to design strategies and interventions to decrease excessive alcohol use for young women in the United States.",1.0,COVID-19,True

126,"(Rodriguez, Litt, & Stewart, 2020), our main research objectives were to test whether distinctive types of COVID-19-related distressdgrief, worry, and financial stressdwere associated with women's heavy drinking behavior. In our study, COVID-19- related grief was significantly associated with heavy drinking. This relationship remained significant after controlling for preexisting mental health diagnoses, depressive and anxiety symptoms, loneliness, and demographic variables. Our measure of COVID-19-related grief captured degrees of reactions reflecting a sense of loss and bitter sentiments related to the pandemic, such as missing out on significant life events or experiencing the loss of vital resources. With sudden disruptions to various celebrations, networking opportunities, relationships, or academic engagements likely leading to such grief, alcohol may have been used as a temporary remedy to compensate for lost pleasures and to regulate feelings of vulnerability related to the unknownness stemming from the pandemic. Our finding supports the self-medication hypothesis in that an individual may engage in substance use as a coping device to help relieve or numb negative emotions, including one's own pain and suffering (Khantzian, 1997).",1.0,COVID-19,True
127,"However, contrary to our hypothesis, we found that participants with higher levels of COVID-19-related worry were more likely to report nonheavy drinking than heavy drinking. Our measure of COVID-19-related worry is composed of concerns related to inaccessibility of COVID-19 tests or treatments, not having enough groceries, or an inability to keep in touch with loved ones. For many individuals, these are concerns that threaten their safety and well-being, but it does not seem that participants tried to cope with them by drinking heavily.",1.0,COVID-19,True
128,"Similarly, Lechner et al. (2021) also found a negative relationship, where a greater level of COVID-19-related fear (i.e., fear of catching COVID-19) was associated with lower drinking rates among college students. A study in the UK also found that being worried about becoming seriously ill from COVID-19, being diagnosed with COVID-19, and having suspected COVID-19 were all associated with lower levels of alcohol use (Garnett et al., 2021). It is plausible that individuals with greater COVID-19- related worry or fear were more vigilant about their health and overall well-being, thereby refraining from heavy drinking. Additional research that examines the mechanisms of COVID19-related worry in relation to heavy drinking is needed to identify intervention targets for reducing heavy drinking among young women.",1.0,negative,True
129,"Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no evidence that COVID-19-related financial stress measured in T1 is associated with heavy drinking in T2. One plausible explanation is that the U.S. government responded to the economic crisis with several stimulus checks and policies for individuals during our T1 period (April to August 2020). As a result, financial stress perceived by these young adults during this time might not have had a significant impact on heavy drinking behaviors. An alternative interpretation is that those who are financially stressed or stretched were living at their parents' home and, therefore, not necessarily in an environment where they would engage in binge drinking. Future research should explore the role of financial stress measured in T2 in heavy drinking among women, especially as it captures stress related to the prolonged nature of the pandemic.",1.0,COVID-19,True
130,It is worthwhile to mention that we conducted an exploratory analysis to test whether COVID-19-related psychological distress was associated with heavy drinking in young men (n ¼ 121). We,1.0,COVID-19,True
131,"found that none of the psychological distress variables were significantly associated with men's heavy alcohol use during the pandemic. This finding may add to the growing evidence that women are more vulnerable to experiencing pandemic-related psychological distress. However, given the small sample size of young men (n ¼ 121), future studies should further explore the factors associated with young men's heavy drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic.",1.0,pandemic,True
132,"Study limitations are the following. First, our measures were based on self-reports that may have been subject to biases, including social desirability bias and recall bias that may underestimate alcohol consumption. Second, considering that White women comprised the majority of our study sample, caution must be taken in the generalization of our study findings to the broader U.S. young adult population. Third, owing to the limitations of CARES data on alcohol use measures, we could not explore the range of alcohol-related problem behaviors. For future research, a comprehensive measure of alcohol use that includes the frequency and quantity of regular consumption, frequency and quantity of the largest amount consumed, and frequency of binge drinking should be used. Fourth, our COVID-19-related grief measure generally captures explicit and self-evident (or definite) types of grief. Future COVID-19-related grief measures should examine specific features of grief, including anticipatory or ambiguous loss (i.e., uncertainty about the current situation) and complicated grief (i.e., a persistent sense of loss) (Bertuccio & Runion, 2020). This process could help to distinguish the contributing role of each unique grief feature versus overall COVID-19-related grief in health risk behaviors during a pandemic. Finally, in terms of drinking behavior, CARES data are limited by a lack of measures exploring motivation and attitudes on drinking or genetic predispositions. Going forward, researchers should include a more comprehensive assessment to develop a greater nuanced understanding of coping-motivated drinking behaviors.",1.0,social,True
133,Implications for Practice and/or Policy,0.0,,False
134,"Despite these limitations, this study has some methodological strengths. Using two time points allowed us to predict heavy alcohol consumption because all predictors preceded the heavy drinking variable. With approximately one in four women reporting heavy drinking during the pandemic, this finding points to the need for alcohol reduction support for women. In addition, this study sheds light on the differential effects of various COVID-19-related distresses on alcoholrelated behaviors. The finding that young women reporting higher levels of COVID-19-related grief were more likely to report heavy drinking suggests that mental health clinicians should address this form of COVID-19-related distress as the pandemic continues to claim lives and cause prolonged economic and mental health consequences. Women should be informed about the negative effect of pandemic-related grief on alcohol intake. In particular, clinicians and researchers should pay greater attention to screening COVID-19-related distress in women and design subsequent clinical interventions focusing on COVID-19-related grief to ensure an appropriate response to alcohol problems. Ongoing observation of drinking behavior trends across time is warranted to determine the long-term mental health and alcohol-related impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.",1.0,pandemic,True
