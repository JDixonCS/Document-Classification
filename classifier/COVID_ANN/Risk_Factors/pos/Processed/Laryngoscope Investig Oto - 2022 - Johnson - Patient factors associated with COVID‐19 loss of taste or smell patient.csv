10,"Objectives: Dysfunction in smell or taste is well recognized phenomenon in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to quantify the incidence and associated co-morbidities of reported olfactory or gustatory dysfunction in patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: From March 23, 2020 through July 31, 2020, 192,683 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at Mayo Clinic. These patients with a positive test were contacted via telephone by physicians at Mayo Clinic and information gathered on patient demographics, comorbidities, symptoms and clinical risk stratification based on these factors. Results: Two thousand two hundred and fifty patients tested positive for SARSCoV-2 (1.2%). Six hundred and sixty-seven (29.6%) of these patients reported loss of smell or taste. Factors found to be correlated with reporting loss of smell or taste on multivariate analysis were: younger age, female sex, or symptoms of chest pain or tightness, cough, or headache and lower clinical risk category. Coronary artery disease (CAD) was associated with not reporting loss of taste or smell. Conclusion: Of 2250 patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at Mayo Clinic, 667 reported loss of taste and smell. Patients who reported loss of smell or taste were younger, female and more likely to report cough, chest pain, headache, or history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but overall had fewer high-risk comorbidities. Those who were older, male, and a reported history of CAD were less likely to report chemosensory dysfunction. Our data are the largest single institution data reporting COVID-19 associated loss of smell or taste, and the first to associate COPD and CAD as factors that affect rates of reported chemosensory dysfunction.

20,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic has caused widespread morbidity and mortality and has prompted investigation to better understand and characterize the disease. Smell and taste dysfunction are common symptoms in COVID-19 patients.1,2 One systemic review and meta-analysis of smell and taste dysfunction in nearly 20,000 COVID-19 patients places olfactory dysfunction at 48% and gustatory dysfunction at 41%.3 Other systematic reviews and meta-analyses publish similar results regarding the rates of smell and taste dysfunction.4-6 However, there is little in the literature regarding comorbidities that are associated with reporting loss of smell or taste. Female sex and younger age have been associated with reporting loss of smell or taste in some smaller studies.7,8 This study reports the incidence olfactory and gustatory symptoms and characterizes the associated attributes and comorbidities of 2250 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at Mayo Clinic from March 23, 2020 to July 31, 2020. Additionally, there is discussion of relevant literature regarding the ACE2 receptor as the cellular entry point for SARSCoV-2, variable expression of ACE2 in certain comorbid conditions, and the role these factors may play on rates of reported chemosensory dysfunction.",1.0,coronavirus,True

Our findings of higher rates of reported olfactory or gustatory dysfunction in females and younger patients agree with several recently published studies.1,5,7,8 Among the recorded races, there is a statistical difference when all groups are included in Chi-square analysis.

A 34.8% of the Asian group reported loss of taste or smell, which is consistent with a metaanalysis of 30,000 COVID-19 patients that found Asians to have the highest rate of chemosensory dysfunction, though not found to be statistically significant in our data.12",1.0,COVID-19,True
161,"In the patient interview via phone with a physician, patients were asked ""have you noticed any loss of taste or smell?"" This was a single question in a questionnaire obtaining clinical and symptomatic data. It may be that the lower reported rate of loss of smell or taste at our institution is related to this being an isolated, subjective question among a lengthy interview. One study that utilized objective olfactory testing reported 98% of patients having at least some olfactory dysfunction.10 Another possible influence on the observed rate was the Mayo Clinic patient screening process. To safely care for patients during the timeframe of the study, SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasopharyngeal testing was conducted on all patients, regardless of clinical presentation, within 7 days of an outpatient clinic visit and within 2 days of a planned surgical procedure. It is possible that this high volume of previsit screening of asymptomatic patients contributes to our lower observed rate of reported chemosensory dysfunction. However, data recording the indication for administering the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test completed as part of patient screening was not collected by the CFCT. Previously published studies include independently answered patient surveys and physician-led patient survey.1,2,13 Length of time between testing positive and data collection in these studies was not clearly defined and not uniform from patient to patient. Early in the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, it was noted that symptoms may lag 2-14 days behind infection.11 In more recent studies, it was reported that onset of anosmia or ageusia was 4-5 days after the onset of other symptoms of COVID-19.14,15 There is some variability in the literature however, with 13%-79% of patients having olfactory or gustatory symptoms prior to the onset of other symptoms of COVID-19.16 In our study, data was collected within 24 h of positive test result, which could contribute to our lower observed rate, with testing of symptomatic patients potentially occurring prior to the onset of alteration of smell or taste or testing of asymptomatic",1.0,clinical,True

166,"By clinical risk groups, the low-risk group reported the highest rate of loss of smell or taste. These patients had zero of the listed risk factors potentially associated with poor outcomes with COVID infection as listed in the methods section. Notably, the rate of reported loss of smell or taste decreased in each of the higher risk groups. This represents decreased reporting of loss of taste or smell in patients with more reported chronic medical conditions. In 2011-2012, it was observed that patients with history of heart failure, heart attack, and liver disease reported taste disorder in the previous year, and those with asthma and emphysema reported smell disorder in the previous year.17 It is also well documented that many medications, including antibiotics, antihistamines, antihypertensives, and statins can impair smell and taste.18 At baseline, older patients have decreased olfactory and gustatory function, and this may be further complicated by comorbidities and increased medication use in older patients.18,19 In our cohort, it may be that younger patients are more sensitive to acute change in taste or smell due to higher baseline chemosensory function.",1.0,clinical,True
167,"Our findings regarding CAD in relation to smell and taste symptoms associated SARS-CoV-2 infection are, to the best of our knowledge, the first recognition of these relationships in the literature. On multivariate analysis, the presence of comorbid CAD was associated with lower rates of reporting loss of smell or taste (OR 0.325, p < .0001). Review of the literature does not reveal a clear connection between CAD and loss of taste or smell, though one notes the opposite association, that those with olfactory dysfunction were more likely to be free of cardiovascular disease.20 It has been described that in patients with CAD, ACE2 expression is increased, both in circulating plasma, as well as in cardiac tissue.21 The role of circulating ACE2 and its effect on smell and taste are unclear. No data are published regarding the relationship between circulating ACE2 and nasal ACE2 expression. It has been shown that ACE2 is expressed on the apical sustentacular cells of the olfactory neuroepithelium, rather than the olfactory neurons and is thought to be the site of binding of SARSCoV2.22 This gives credence to the theory that olfactory loss is caused due to damage of the supporting cells within the olfactory epithelium.9,22 It has also been reported that use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, which are common in patients with CAD, does not affect the expression of nasal ACE2 expression.23 Though the data in this study conflicts with other published data, the mechanism of effect of cardiovascular disease on loss of smell or taste in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains not fully understood and represents a possible area of further research.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
168,"COPD was associated with an OR of 2.26 for reporting of taste and smell loss, although this did not reach statistical significance (p ,"" .06), and only 26 patients reported having COPD. This data is included because of the magnitude of correlation, which means that a patient having COPD was correlated with a 226% greater likelihood of reporting loss of taste or smell. It has been described that the ACE2 receptor is the binding site of cellular entry for SARS-CoV-2, and data has demonstrated that the ACE2 is most highly expressed in the nasal""",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
169,"cavity.24 There are also several recently published studies that found increased lung expression of ACE2 in those with COPD.24-26 Although the correlation between lung and nasal ACE2 expression has not been reported in patients with COPD, if nasal ACE2 expression is increased with COPD, this may explain the association of COPD with reporting loss of taste and smell in our study.27 In our study, younger patients were more likely to report loss of smell or taste. It is possible though that older patients, with reduced olfactory function, may not have noticed a change in sense of smell compared to younger patients.19 However, this is confounded by the fact that children express lower levels of ACE2 in their nasal epithelium compared to adults.28 The conflicting nature of published data highlights the need to further investigate the pathogenesis of alteration of smell and taste caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, any conclusions regarding COPD and loss of smell or taste must be made with caution, given the non-significant nature of the data and the few number of patients (n ,"" 26) reporting COPD. Characterization of nasal expression of ACE2 in COPD and CAD may allow for better understanding of the pathophysiology of smell and taste dysfunction, or lack thereof, in these patients.""",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

This limits our study in that reported chemosensory dysfunction was investigated only by asking whether symptoms of loss of smell or taste were present. In addition, the combination of asking about taste and smell together in one question does not allow for differentiation between olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. Some biases could include the short time frame from positive test to interview, testing of asymptomatic patients, perceived pressure with questions from a physician, and possible social stigma associated with reporting COVID-19 symptoms.",1.0,Coronavirus,True
