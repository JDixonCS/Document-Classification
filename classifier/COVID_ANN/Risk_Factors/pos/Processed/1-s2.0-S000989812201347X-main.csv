9,"Background: Surfactant protein-D (SP-D) is a lung-resident protein that has emerged as a potential biomarker for COVID-19. Previous investigations on acute respiratory distress syndrome patients demonstrated a significant increment of SP-D serum levels in pathological conditions. Since SP-D is not physiologically permeable to alveolicapillary membrane and poorly expressed by other tissues, this enhancement is likely due to an impairment of the pulmonary barrier caused by prolonged inflammation. Methods: A retrospective study on a relatively large cohort of patients of Hospital Pio XI of Desio was conducted to assess differences of the hematic SP-D concentrations among COVID-19 patients and healthy donors and if SPD levels resulted a risk factor for disease severity and mortality. Results: The first analysis, using an ANOVA-model, showed a significant difference in the mean of log SP-D levels between COVID-19 patients and healthy donors. Significant variations were also found between dead vs survived patients. Results confirm that SP-D concentrations were significantly higher for both hospitalized COVID-19 and dead patients, with threshold values of 150 and 250 ng/mL, respectively. Further analysis conducted with Lo­ gistic Mixed models, highlighted that higher SP-D levels at admission and increasing differences among follow-up and admission values resulted the strongest significant risk factors of mortality (model predictive accuracy, AUC ,"" 0.844). Conclusions: The results indicate that SP-D can be a predictive marker of COVID-19 disease and its outcome. Considering its prognostic value in terms of mortality, the early detection of SP-D levels and its follow-up in hospitalized patients should be considered to direct the therapeutic intervention.""",1.0,COVID-19,True

12,"To identify specific markers for pulmonary diseases, the surfactant protein D (SP-D) was broadly investigated [2]. SP-D is a low abundant (0.6 %) hydrophilic protein strongly involved in lung homeostasis through two specific functions: 1) SP-D is able to bind highly conserved glycosidic residues exposed on pathogens surface triggering their clearance by agglutination and/or opsonization; 2) SP-D directly",1.0,disease,True
13,"modulates the activity of lung resident immune cells: under physiolog­ ical conditions, it has an anti-inflammatory effect, whereas under several specific stimuli (e.g., pathogens infection) it promotes inflam­ mation [2-4]. SP-D has long been used as a diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker for interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) [5-7] and acute respira­ tory distress syndrome (ARDS) [8,9]. In particular, an enhancement of serum levels of SP-D was observed in these pathologic conditions [2]. Given the extremely low permeability of SP-D to alveoli-capillary membrane and its poor expression in extrapulmonary tissues, the pre­ viously mentioned effect is generally attributed to an impairment of the pulmonary barrier caused by prolonged inflammation [2,10,11].

199,"The strong impact of COVID-19 on public health worldwide has attracted tremendous attention of the scientific community in the attempt to establish a reliable predictive strategy for this life-threatening disease. In the effort to identify a valid hallmark of COVID-19, our attention was focused on SP-D for several reasons: 1) SP-D is mainly produced by lung-resident cells and secreted in alveolar space [10,16]; 2) loss of air-blood barrier integrity is responsible for the outward intravascular leakage of lung-secreted proteins [11]; 3) our previous observations from clinical samples analyses pointed out that COVID-19 patients under mechanical ventilation exhibited decreased pulmonary levels of SP-D [17]. Thus, SP-D may be a good indicator for alveolar damage, recognized as one of the causes for extrapulmonary manifes­ tations and complications of COVID-19 [18].",1.0,COVID-19,True
200,"In this study, we have demonstrated that plasmatic SP-D concen­ tration correlates significantly with COVID-19 incidence. Notably, the analyses performed using an ANOVA model, showed a significant dif­ ference in the mean of log plasma SP-D upon admission between hos­ pitalized patients and healthy donors (Fig. 1). Considering the 95 % confidence intervals, a value in the range of 144.6 and 206.2 ng/mL SPD was identified as threshold to discriminate COVID-19 cases and healthy donors. In addition, significant discrepancies in SP-D levels at T0 were observed when comparing dead vs survived patients. In the mentioned conditions, SP-D hematic concentrations were significantly higher for COVID-19 patients and dead cases (Figs. 1 and 2).",1.0,COVID-19,True
201,"The augmented SP-D plasma levels here observed in COVID-19 hospitalized patients as compared with healthy individuals are in line with previous studies conducted on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [14,19,20]. Moreover, our values result highly comparable to those obtained in other cases (e.g. patients of the Fourth Hospital of Yiyang of Hunan, China- February-March 2020) [12]. This enhanced amount of SP-D into the blood of COVID-19 patients is likely favored by the inflammatory framework associated with the pulmonary infection [2,4]: it has been proved that activated inflammation state and cytokine release promote the secretion of SP-D into the blood circulation, which persists and increases over lung injury [21,22]. It is worth noting that not all the studies reported in literature recorded high hematological levels of SP-D in COVID-19 patients and most of them assume this is",1.0,COVID-19,True
202,"caused by a downregulation in the surfactant production subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 infection of alveolar type II cells [23-25]. However, our data are supported by the fact that SP-D is secreted also by other lung resident cells (particularly Clara cells) [26,27] and that in other path­ ological conditions, where the infective agent preferentially target type II pneumocytes (e.g., influenza A virus) [28], an enhancement of SP-D levels is observed in severe patients [25,29].",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True
203,"Our study evidenced that SP-D plasma levels are not useful to distinguish the severity of COVID-19 patients, even using a log of their values (Fig. 1). On the other hand, a strong correlation of SP-D plasma levels with mortality has been observed (Fig. 2). It should be pointed out that an analogue significant correlation with mortality has been previ­ ously described only in one study, where higher plasma SP-D levels at the time of admission were detected in non-survivors versus survivor patients [20]. In the other investigations reported in literature, a sig­ nificant increase of SP-D is generally associated to a stratification of disease severity [12-14]. Differences from case to case can be due to several reasons, including the methods used to determine the COVID-19 severity, the characteristics and the number of the patients recruited. With regard to the latter, it is important to highlight that our study in­ cludes a quite large number of patients (>200), compared to the ones previously quoted, which are based on a much smaller collection of samples (100).",1.0,COVID-19,True
204,"Further analysis conducted with Logistic Mixed models, highlighted that SP-D at T0 (SP-D1) and the difference among follow-up and admission values (Diff_SP-D), in a model with Age, resulted the strongest significant risk factors of mortality (model predictive accuracy, AUC ,"" 0.844). The latter result corroborates the hypothesis that high plasmatic level of SP-D and its increase over time correlate with an impaired clinical status and an unfavorable outcome. The higher significance recorded in Diff_SP-D reveals that it is of utmost importance to monitor the follow-up in COVID-19 patients besides measuring SP-D plasma levels at admission. As regards the severity, it has been observed that an increased risk does not correlate with SP-D values as well as with all the covariates considered in this study, except CPAP.""",1.0,clinical,True
205,"In conclusion, the overall data indicate SP-D as a valid marker of COVID-19 and its outcome. Notably, 150 ng/mL and 250 ng/mL SP-D in plasma can be proposed as cut-off values to predict the disease incidence and mortality. This is the first study in Europe in which a significant correlation between SP-D levels and mortality has been determined, by an accurate statistical analysis on a large number of patients. The latter evidence makes SP-D as an important prognostic factor in hospitalized patients. Therefore, the early detection of this protein should be considered for scheduling adequate preventive treatments for COVID-19 patients.",1.0,COVID-19,True
