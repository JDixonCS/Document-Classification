10,"Introduction Current theories postulate that the most serious complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including multiple reports of cerebrovascular disease [1], may be secondary to a systemic coagulopathy increasing the risk of thrombosis and the formation of microemboli [2]. This is thought to be a direct consequence of binding of the virus to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors on the endothelial vessel lining [3], or the development of an antiphospholipid antibody [4]. A small but growing number of reports have now described stroke in younger COVID-19 patients [5-7]. However, conclusions surrounding the effect of established vascular risk factors in these cases are inconsistent. In addition,",1.0,coronavirus,True

13,"Emergency presentation A 39-year-old white male developed sudden onset dysphasia while at home. An ambulance was called approximately 33 minutes following symptom onset, by which point he had begun to exhibit right-sided hemiplegia and facial weakness. The patient had been self-isolating at home for approximately 2 weeks owing to symptoms of cough, fever, shortness of breath, and vomiting.",0.0,,False

NIHSS score was calculated as 13 and suggested a right partial anterior circulation stroke. Computed tomography (CT) head imaging 8 minutes after arrival was reported normal. Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-TPA) was initiated 56 minutes following arrival. A repeat NIHSS hours following thrombolysis was recorded as 18.",0.0,,False
19,"The patient was also tachypneic with respiratory distress and sinus tachycardia. Capillary blood glucose was measured as 27.6 mmol/L. Arterial blood gas analysis on 21% oxygen revealed type 1 respiratory failure with a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 5.85 kPa. He was started on 10 L/minute of oxygen. Chest X-ray revealed extensive bilateral peripheral predominant opacification involving upper mid and lower zones. Highresolution CT chest (Fig. 1) was formally reported to show moderately severe bilateral ground-glass changes affecting all lobes, consistent with COVID-19-related features. Nasopharyngeal aspirates for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were taken and later returned negative; however, in view of his previous symptoms and CT chest findings, he was deemed COVID-19 positive and isolated.",1.0,respiratory,True

He required 15 L/minute oxygen to maintain target saturation and became febrile with temperature of 39 °C. He remained tachypneic, tachycardic, and normotensive. The GCS decreased to between 8 and 10, and the left pupil became fixed and dilated. Repeat CT scan was performed (Fig. 3) and revealed evidence of a dense left middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic infarct with mass effect and 1 cm midline shift to the right, resulting in hydrocephalus and raised intracranial pressure.

32,"Discussion In further support for the COVID-19 leading to a prothrombotic state, this patient's COVID-19 related respiratory illness was contemporaneous with his cerebrovascular infarct and mirrored its severity, strongly suggesting a mechanistic relationship. This is consistent with some reports describing stroke in patients managed for COVID-19 in intensive care [8], but in most reports the temporal relationship is not clear.",1.0,COVID-19,True
33,"The patient was apparently fit and healthy prior to his presentation; however, initial investigations revealed undiagnosed severe diabetes mellitus as well as a deranged lipid profile. Given his age and background, it is unclear whether these factors increased the risk of his large vessel thrombosis through a typical atherosclerotic mechanism. Although established atherosclerotic risk factors are considered important predictors for the severity of COVID-19 [9], available reports have not been able to consistently associate these with largevessel thrombosis in younger COVID-19 patients [5-7].",1.0,COVID-19,True
34,"Prospective studies are now needed to further characterize the associations between COVID-19 and cerebrovascular disease and other thrombotic disorders, as well as establish causatively whether and how vascular risk factors might influence the prothrombotic state independently from atherosclerosis. This will enable",1.0,COVID-19,True
35,"Conclusion This case adds to the small but growing body of reports describing young patients suffering cerebrovascular thromboembolic events during COVID-19 infection, including a limited number suffering large-vessel cerebral infarction [6]. As one of the youngest cases reported, and yet with clear evidence of diabetes mellitus, it illustrates a potential link between established vascular risk factors and the cerebrovascular complications of COVID-19 even in young patients. This case should prompt further investigation into the possible mechanisms for cerebrovascular complications of COVID-19 and how these may interact with the atherosclerotic state. This will help risk stratify patients into the optical treatment.",1.0,case,True
