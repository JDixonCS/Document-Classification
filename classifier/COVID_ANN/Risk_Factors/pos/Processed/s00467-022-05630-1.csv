8,"Introduction: Kidney allograft rejection can occur in clinically stable patients, but long-term significance in pediatric kTx recipients is unknown. Previous single-center studies demonstrated that subclinical borderline (SC-Borderline) or T-cell mediated rejection (SC-TCMR) are associated with an increased risk of acute rejection. However, the prevalence and significance of subclinical antibody-mediated rejection (SCAMR) and the impact of subclinical rejection phenotypes on graft survival remained to be assessed. Material and methods: We used data from pediatric (<21) patients transplanted between 2005 and 2017 from 8 institutions in France and the United States performing surveillance biopsies. Biopsies were identified as surveillance if they were recorded as such in the medical record with no significant increase in serum creatinine or proteinuria. Biopsies were graded according to the Banff 2019 criteria. DSA screening was performed according to each center protocol. Kaplan Meier method and log-rank test were used to compare the risk of acute rejection, transplant glomerulopathy and graft loss stratified on the surveillance biopsies' findings. Results: 1390 surveillance biopsies were performed in 763 kTx recipients including 135 (9,7%) SC-borderline, 46 (3,3%) SC-TCMR, 54 (3,9%) SC-ABMR, 8 (0,6%) subclinical mixte rejections. Subclinical rejection was associated with acute rejection with 5-year rejection-free survival of 88%, 78%, 68% and 63% in the no rejection, SC-borderline, SC-TCMR and SC-AMR groups, respectively (p<0,0001). SC-TCMR and SC-AMR were associated with the development of transplant glomerulopathy, p<0,0001. Subclinical AMR only was associated with a lower 5-year graft survival (79% vs. 93% (SC-TCMR), 95% (SC-Borderline), 94% (no rejection)), p,""0,002.

Results: We included 4528 KTx recipients with median age at KTx 11 years (interquartile range [IQR] 6-14) and median follow-up of 10 years (IQR 4-17). During the follow-up 1688 patients (37.3%) experienced graft failure (GF) and 159 (3.5%) died with functioning graft. The respective 5year GF after live (LD) and deceased donor (DD) KTx performed in 19902000 were 14% and 25% as compared to 4% and 12% in KTx between 2011-2020. There was a time-varying association between time to DCGL (P<0.05) and donor source, recipient and donor age and panel reactive antibodies (PRA). The benefit of LD was most pronounced in the first months after KTx, then decreased steadily and was no longer significant from 130 months on. Increasing recipient age corresponded with a decline in adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for DCGL in the first months post KTx, but had the opposite effect between 50 and 100 months. Donor age of 20 years corresponded with the lowest aHR for DCGL. Panel reactive antibodies (PRA) 1-15% was associated with a higher aHR than PRA 0% up until 50 months post KTx. The aHR for DCGL decreased with ascending year of KTx up until 2000 and remained stable afterwards.

Results: The study included 66 moderate-severe-critically ill patients with COVID-19 (9.71 ± 6.08 years) and 111 MIS-C patients (8.72 ± 4.72 years). The frequency of AKI was 22.7% in COVID-19 and 15.3% in MIS-C; among them AKI was present on admission in 73.3% and 88.2% of COVID-19 and MIS-C groups, respectively. In univariate analyzes, presentation with vomiting/diarrhea, high LDH, D-dimer, troponin and procalcitonin on admission were associated with AKI in COVID-19 patients; whereas older age, low albumin, hemoglobin, thrombocyte, and high CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, troponin, and BNP levels and low ejection fraction on echocardiography on admission were associated with AKI in MIS-C group. Length of hospital stay was significantly longer in both COVID-19 and MIS-C patients with AKI, compared to those without AKI. Mortality was 9.1% in COVID19 group; there was no mortality in MIS-C patients. AKI was associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients (p,0.021).

Material and methods: Review of prospectively collected data submitted to the IPPN registry (www.pedpd.org) at 137 pediatric dialysis centers in 44 countries between 04/2007 and 01/2022. Results: A total of 2107 peritonitis episodes and 170 relapses were reported in 1179 out of 4289 patients during 5498 patient years follow-up, i.e. an annualized peritonitis rate of 0.38 per patient. Peritonitis rates varied by region and country and were lowest in Asia (0.23) and highest in ANZAC and Eastern Europe (0.81, 0.5). Peritonitis rates steadily decreased in all world regions, from 0.5 per patient year prior to 2012 to 0.28 after 2016. 46% of the episodes were caused by gram-positive, 25% by gram-negative, 4% by fungal and 1% by multiple organisms, whereas 24% were culture negative, without significant variation over time. S.aureus and S.epidermidis were the most frequently isolated organisms and culture negative peritonitis was most common in Turkey and Latin America. Multivariate mixed model analysis identified the following risk factors for peritonitis: younger age (OR 0.97, CI 0.95-0.98, p<0.0001), presence of an ostomy (OR 1.44, CI 1.17-1.76, p,""0.0004), impaired cognitive development (OR 1.48, CI 1.22-1.79, p<0.0001), low serum albumin level (0.98, CI 0.97-0.99, p"",""0.005), and exposure to high dialysate glucose (OR 1.23, CI 1.08-1.41, p"",""0.03). 15% of the total variability was attributable to center effects and 6% to region-specific effects.

This Na retention is usually attributed to epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activation following plasma aldosterone increase. However, most nephrotic patients show normal aldosterone levels. Material and methods: We used a corticosteroid-clamped version of the PAN nephrotic rat model (CC-PAN) to attempt to identify the sodium entry pathway in these patients. Emphasis Type,""Bold>Results: CC-PAN rat showed electrogenic and amiloride-sensitive sodium reabsorption in cortical collecting duct similar to that of PAN rats but no increase in expression or activation of ENaC. We isolated from CC-PAN rat kidney a cDNA encoding a variant of acid sensing ion channel 2b (ASIC2b) lacking most of its N-ter intracellular domain. Co-expression of truncated ASIC2b with ASIC2a in X. laevis oocytes induced acid-stimulated sodium currents which were not transient but lasted as long as the stimulus remained. Interestingly, in ASIC2b-null rats generated by CRISPR-Cas9 technology, the injection of PAN did not induce sodium retention. Expression of ASIC2a and of truncated ASIC2b was increased in the ASDN of CC-PAN rats. ASIC2a and truncated-ASIC2b thus constitute channels supporting epithelial sodium reabsorption. Expression of truncated ASIC2b was abolished in albumin deficient rats and in rats treated with ERK kinase inhibitor. ASIC2 mRNA was also detected in kidney biopsies from patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome but in any of the patients with other renal diseases. In ASIC2-positive nephrotic patients, ASIC2 was expressed in ASDN. Conclusions: We have, therefore, identified a novel variant of ASIC2b responsible for the renal Na retention in the pathological context of INS.""",1.0,disease,True

Here we show that the podocyte is a key initiator in Shiga toxin HUS, which could explain why the glomerulus is the prime target of systemic Shiga toxin driven infection. Material and methods: To demonstrate that the podocyte Shiga toxin receptor (Gb3) is sufficient to trigger the development of HUS, we used conditional gene targeting to engineer human Gb3 expression specifically in the podocytes of adult mice (PodGb3). Results: PodGb3 mice developed HUS (thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia and uraemia p<0.05) at day 10 following intraperitoneal Stx. Renal histology demonstrated glomerular TMA; with intracapillary thrombus formation seen on electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence demonstrated an increase in glomerular fibrinogen deposition and C3b vs. controls. Additionally, glomerular expression of complement regulator Factor H was significantly reduced in PodGb3 mice, rendering them more susceptible to complement attack. Furthermore, C5 inhibition was found to rescue the Shiga toxin HUS phenotype. Conclusions: Together, these observations provide compelling evidence for the importance of podocyte to glomerular endothelial cell cross-talk within the kidney in the development of Shiga toxin associated HUS and suggest a possible therapeutic role for complement inhibition in patients with this devastating disease.",1.0,flu,True

FGF23 has been associated with inflammation and impaired osteoclastogenesis, however these pathways have not yet been studied in XLH. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether XLH patients display peculiar inflammatory and osteoclastic profile.

56,"Introduction: Detecting active lupus nephritis in a background of preexisting renal damage is challenging, so new biomarkers are much needed to guide clinical practice. Recently, we showed that HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) is highly expressed in the glomeruli and in the tubular compartment of patients with lupus nephritis and in a lupus mouse model (NZM2410), but not in healthy individuals or patients with other mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritides. Furthermore, we showed, in vitro, that HER2 controls mesangial cell proliferation through miR-26a and miR-30b. In this study, we explored the clinical utility of urinary HER2 (uHER2) as a biomarker of lupus nephritis activity. Material and methods: Prospective, multicenter, study of children and adolescents with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis. Clinical data and urine were collected periodically and uHER2 was quantified by ELISA. The control groups were: healthy individuals, patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and patients submitted to bone marrow transplant with acute kidney injury (AKI). A validation study was performed in an adult cohort. Results: We studied 771 samples of 113 children and adolescents with lupus nephritis (81% female; median age 15; 41% class IV). uHER2 was significantly increased in patients with active lupus nephritis (renalSLEDAI4; p,0.006) and not in children with AKI (n,""50), JIA (n"",20) or healthy controls (n,""40). uHER2 levels were associated with casts, hematuria and new onset proteinuria (p<0.05).

In adults with SLE (n"",189; 126 with lupus nephritis) uHER2 was significantly increased when nephritis was active when compared with patients with renal-SLEDAI 0 or healthy controls. Conclusions: In this prospective study of a large cohort of pediatric patients with lupus nephritis we showed that uHER2 is a biomarker of disease activity.

61,"Introduction: Typical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is the main cause of acute kidney injury in children under 5 years and occurs after ingestion of Shigatoxin (Stx) producing Escherichia coli (STEC). Prevalence of STEC carriage is unknown in household contacts in France, and has been scarcely studied in other countries. Objectives: To assess the prevalence of STEC carriage around HUS cases and study the characteristics associated with STEC carriage in the household. Material and methods: Stool samples from patients with diarrheaassociated HUS that presented to our institution between 2007 to 2020. Stool samples were analyzed by Stx RT-PCR (Stx-PCR) to establish the frequency in HUS patients and their contacts. Results: 179 household contacts of 151 HUS patients were analyzed. The prevalence of Stx detection by PCR in household HUS contacts was 22.9%. 40% of HUS patients had a least one STEC positive household contact. The prevalence was higher in siblings (34.3%), especially in those with little age-difference (<5 years) with the HUS case (37.8%). Thus, age difference < 5 years (versus > 5 years of age difference) and siblings (versus parents) were statistically associated with an increased risk of STEC detection in household contacts. Contacts with diarrhea or with positive Stx-PCR were prescribed azithromycin for 3 days. None of the 179 household contacts developed HUS symptoms. Conclusions: Prevalence of STEC carriage in HUS household contacts is higher than in the general population. This population need to be further studied to assess potential protective factors. Further studies are needed to assess whether azithromycin may prevent the development of HUS in household contacts.",1.0,contact,True

73,"Introduction: The accuracy of conventional urinalysis in diagnosing urinary tract infection (UTI) in children is limited, leading to unnecessary antibiotic exposure in a large fraction of patients. Urinary Heat Shock Protein 70 (uHSP70) is a novel marker of acute urinary tract inflammation. We explored the added value of uHSP70 in discriminating UTI from other infections and conditions confused with UTI. Material and methods: 802 children from 37 pediatric centers in seven countries participated in the study. Patients diagnosed with UTI (n,""191), non-UTI infections (n"",""178), contaminated urine samples (n"",""50), asymptomatic bacteriuria (n"",""26), and healthy controls (n"",75) were enrolled. Urine and serum levels of HSP70 were measured at presentation in all patients and after resolution of the infection in patients with confirmed UTI. Results: Urinary (u)HSP70 was selectively elevated in children with UTI as compared to all other conditions (p<0.0001). uHSP70 predicted UTI with 88.5% sensitivity and 82.2% specificity (AUC,""0.934).

78,"Introduction: Solitary functioning kidney (SFK) is a relatively common condition predisposing to kidney injury. Although several monogenic causes were identified, most cases cannot yet be explained. Therefore, its aetiology is likely multifactorial and several environmental risk factors have been reported, while common genetic variation may also contribute to genetic susceptibility. To identify common variants involved in the aetiology of SFK, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Material and methods: GWAS was performed using 702 patients with congenital SFK from the SOFIA study and 660 geographically matched controls from the AGORA data- and biobank. Phenotypic subgroups were created a priori. Association tests were performed in PLINK 2.0 on an imputed dataset under the assumption of an additive model. Principal component analyses were used to exclude ancestral outliers and control for population stratification. Results were analysed on individual SNP level with a fixed genome-wide significance threshold of 5 × 10-8 and on gene level using MAGMA with a significance threshold of 0.05/number of genes tested. Results: In both the overall and subgroup analyses, no SNP reached the genome-wide significance threshold, with the top SNP at 6.3 × 10-7 in overall analyses and 9.3 × 10-8 in the MCDK subgroup. Analyses on gene level did not yield results above the significance threshold either, but candidate genes were identified that will be investigated further and results will be shared during the conference. Conclusions: Our GWAS on the aetiology of SFK did not identify variants reaching genome-wide significance, most likely because of a lack of power. However, some of the identified variants may contribute to the genetic understanding of SFK and will be topic of further study.",1.0,case,True

Although often already discovered in utero, the ultrasound workup does not allow an accurate assessment of outcome. Our study aimed to clarify the relationship between ultrasound data and outcome. Material and methods: For a total of 136 fetuses with bilateral CAKUT (except bilateral agenesis) and a 2-year postnatal follow-up, we collected data on amniotic fluid (AF) volume, number of functional kidneys, and presence of renal dysplasia or cysts using a standardized ultrasound-based observation protocol. Cramers V was used to measure the strength of 2to-2 dependence of changes. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to study the association of ultrasound features with postnatal renal survival.

Dysplasia was significantly associated with both AF volume (Cramer's V:0.24) and the presence of cysts (Cramer's V:0.44). Reduced AF volume (OR,""132 [95%CI:21-2666]), dysplasia occurrence (OR"",31 [95%CI:3-785]) and presence of cysts (OR,16 [95%CI:1-460]) were identified as independent risk factors of poor prognosis. Combination of the 3 features yielded an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.92 for prediction of renal postnatal outcome in leave-one-out cross validation. Functional enrichment analysis of the AF proteome led to association of dysplasia with the term extracellular matrix organization and cysts with immunity.

Comorbidities were registered at the start of KRT. Differences in access to kidney transplantation (KT), patient and graft survival were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression. Results: At least one comorbidity was present in one third (33%) of children commencing KRT, and acquired cardiovascular diseases occurred most frequently. The comorbidity prevalence has steadily increased by 5% per year since 2007. Comorbidities were most frequent in patients from high-income countries (43% vs. 24% in low-income and 32.9 in middle-income countries). Patients with comorbidities had a lower access to transplantation (aHR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.61 - 0.74), and a higher risk of death (aHR 1.79; 95% CI: 1.38-2.32). The increased risk of death was only seen in dialysis patients (aHR 1.60; 95% CI: 1.21-2.13), and not after kidney transplantation. For both outcomes, the impact of comorbidities was stronger in low-income countries. However, once transplanted, 5year graft survival was not affected by the presence of comorbidities (aHR for graft failure: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.84-1.65). Conclusions: Extra-renal diseases have become more frequent in children and adolescents on KRT and reduce their access to kidney transplantation as well as survival, especially when remaining on dialysis.

106,"Introduction: This cross-sectional study investigates the association of fibroblast growth-factor 23 (FGF23) with systemic inflammation, muscle and protein energy wasting (PEW) in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Material and methods: Serum calcium, phosphorus, 25(OH)D, intact parathormone, c-terminal FGF23, a-Klotho, albumin and IL-6 were measured in 53 patients from 5 to 19 years old with GFR<60 ml/min/1,73m2. PEW was defined as muscle wasting [lean tissue index adjusted to height age (LTI HA) z-score <-1.65 SD), measured by bioimpedance analysis spectroscopy, and at least two of the following: poor growth [height z-score <1.88 SD], questionnaire based reduced appetite, serum albumin  3.8 g/dl. Results: LnFGF23 but not lnKlotho was correlated to LTI HA z-score (rs,""-0.320, p"",0.021) and lnIL-6 (rs,""0.360, p"",""0.009) after adjustment for CKD stage. We performed logistic regression analysis of PEW criteria, including lnFGF23, lnIL-6, CKD stage and bone mineral parameters as covariates. LnFGF23 was significantly associated with muscle wasting (18 patients) (OR 2.763, 95% CI 1.246-6.124), while CKD stage and lnIL6 were significantly associated with poor growth (14 patients) (OR 9.178, 95% CI 1.346-62.582) and reduced albumin (13 patients) (OR 2.257, 95% CI 1.170-4.352) respectively. In backward logistic regression analysis, lnFGF23 was associated with PEW (8 patients) after adjustment for bone mineral parameters, lnIL-6 and CKD stage (OR 4.910, 95% CI 1.957-12.320). Conclusions: Increased FGF23 may be associated with the muscle and PEW process in pediatric moderate and advanced CKD, independently of""",1.0,disease,True

112,"Introduction: Patients with kidney disease (KD) may present an increased risk of thrombotic events due to renal failure, vascular catheterization and medical therapies. In the last decades national and international registries have been created to implement the knowledge around thrombosis in children. The Italian registry of thrombosis in children (R.I.T.I.) was founded in 2007 with the contribution of hematologists, pediatricians, pediatric neurologists and emergency care physicians. Its aim is to collect information nationwide about pediatric and neonatal thrombosis. Starting in 2017, an observational study was designed with the following objectives: i) multiparametric definition of thrombosis in children; ii) development of diagnostic and therapeutic protocols; iii) implementation of a multidisciplinary network (including pediatric nephrologists and oncohemalogists). Material and methods: Since 2017 clinical, instrumental and laboratoristic findings of pediatric patients affected by thrombosis were systematically collected together with the characteristics of the thrombotic events and follow up data. Results: To date, 49 italian hospitals and 121 physicians are contributing to the registry. 727 patients have been included(57%males). Of them, 502(69%) had cerebral thrombosis (68%arterial) while 225(31%) had systemic thrombosis (85%venous). The majority of the included patients(51%) had an event at pre-school age. In the evaluated time period, recurrencies were most frequently observed in pediatric patients(9%) than in newborns(3.5%). 66(9%) patients included in the registry were affected by KD. Of them, 31% had cerebral thrombosis and 69% systemic thrombosis. The nephrologic diagnosis was: AKI(n,22); nephrotic syndrome(n,5); CKD(n,5); dialysis(n,23); miscellaneous(n,18). Conclusions: The progressive implementation of R.I.T.I. from 2007 to date makes it one of the largest registries about children thrombosis internationally. Further collaborations with national and international nephrologic centres are warrented in order to enlarge the knowledge around pediatric thrombosis in patients affected by KD.",1.0,disease,True

117,"Introduction: Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is a common glomerular disease in children. Some patients who develop steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) are also resistant to steroids and other immunosuppressants and can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The treatment of SRNS remains a challenge for pediatric nephrologists. Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3b (SMPDL3b) contributes to the regulation of the podocyte cytoskeleton by enabling ceramide synthesis in the cell membrane. Recent studies suggest that rituximab prevents proteinuria independent of B-cell depletion by inhibiting the downregulation of SMPDL-3b expression or binding to SMPDL-3b. However, the question remains whether the low amount of SMPDL-3b for rituximab to bind in treatment-resistant NS patients with advanced podocyte injury could be the cause of treatment resistance. The present study was conducted to evaluate whether SMPDL-3b level in pretreatment kidney biopsy is predictive of the clinical effectiveness of immunosuppressive drugs, especially rituximab, in patients with SRNS and FSGS. Material and methods: Kidney biopsy specimens from 48 patients diagnosed with INS were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining with antiSMPDL3B and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SMPDL3b mRNA expression. The results were compared according to treatment response. Real time PCR evaluation was done with 2-CT method. Fold change (FC)>1.5 was considered stastically significant. Results: SMPDL-3b expression levels were higher in patients responding to all immunosuppressive treatments, including rituximab and steroids, but it was not considered significant because the fold change (FC) was less than 1.5. SMPDL-3b expression was 1.788 times greater in patients who achieved remission with treatment compared to patients with CKD. When SMPDL-3b expression was compared between patients with SRNS who achieved remission and those who developed CKD, expression was 2.18 times higher and significant in remitted patients (FC>1.5). Conclusions: In our study, we sought to determine whether low SMPDL3b levels in pre-treatment kidney biopsies were associated with resistance to immunosuppressive therapies, especially rituximab. We showed that SMPDL-3b mRNA expression and anti-SMPDL3B staining did not differ significantly between patient groups with different responses to immunosuppressive therapies. Our results indicate that SMPDL-3bexpression is higher in patients with complete remission, both among all patients and within the SRNS subgroup, when compared with patients who progressed to CKD. These results suggest that SMPDL-3b may actually be an indicator of disease progression rather than a marker predicting response to a particular immunosuppressive agent. Our study is the first in the literature to examine SMPDL-3b levels in human kidney biopsy specimens using both immunohistochemical and molecular PCR methods.",1.0,disease,True

122,"Introduction: B-cell depleting anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies have prolonged efficacy in children with frequently-relapsing/steroiddependent nephrotic syndrome (FR/SDNS). However, response to this therapy is variable and treatment-related side effects can occur. We studied the association of several clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters at the baseline with the risk of relapse following anti-CD20 treatment. Material and methods: In this retrospective study, we included 102 FR/ SDNS pediatric patients treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab or ofatumumab). Time to first relapse during a 24-month follow-up and tapering of concomitant immunosuppression was registered for each patient. We used Cox regression to estimate the association of age, sex, previous immunosuppressive treatment (anti-CD20, prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, calcineurin inhibitors), duration of concomitant immunosuppression (prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, calcineurin inhibitors), circulating B-cell subset levels (total CD19+, transitional, mature-naïve and memory B cells) at baseline and time to relapse. Results: Univariate analysis showed that age > 9 years at time of antiCD20 infusion (p,""0.012), previous treatment with anti-CD20 (p"",0.056) and maintenance immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil (p,""0.008) were protective against relapse. In contrast, among all the evaluated B-cell subsets at baseline, only high circulating levels of memory B cells (p<0.001) were significantly associated with relapse. By multivariate analysis, age > 9 years (p"",""0.017), maintenance of mycophenolate mofetil treatment (p"",0.045) and levels of memory B cells at baseline (p,""0.003) retained their significant association with time to relapse, whilst previous treatment with anti-CD20 did not (p"",""0.906). Conclusions: Younger age and high circulating levels of memory B cells at time of anti-CD20 infusion are associated with a higher risk of relapse following anti-CD20 administration. The maintenance of mycophenolate mofetil treatment, more than other immunosuppressors, may prolong remission following anti-CD20 infusion.""",1.0,clinical,True

132,"Introduction: We studied the performance of unattended automated office blood pressure (uAOBP) measurement in children, in relation to oscillometric office BP (OBP) and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Material and methods: 111 stable treated and untreated outpatients investigated for hypertension underwent uAOBP measurements (seated unattended in a quiet room separate from the renal clinic room, six times after a 5 min rest with the BpTRU device). Ambulatory 24h blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed on the same day in a subgroup of 42 children. Results: UAOBP measurements were successful in 106 children (95%), 5 preschool children did not tolerate to be alone in the room. The mean ±SD systolic/diastolic uAOBP, OBP and daytime ABP were 109.1 ± 14.0/70.8 ± 10.7 mmHg, 121.6 ± 16.5/77.6 ± 10.5 mmHg and 123.5 ± 11.3/73.7 ± 6.8 mmHg, respectively. Systolic/diastolic uAOBP was significantly lower than OBP by 13.6/7.6 mmHg (p<0.0001) and lower than daytime ABP by 14.4 ± 0.5/2.9 ± 0.3 mmHg (p<0.0001). The heart rate was not significantly different during uAOBP than during OBP measurements. On Bland Altman analysis the uAOBP underestimated OBP by a mean of 15.6 mmHg for systolic BP and by 8.6 mmHg for diastolic BP. In all 9 children with white-coat systolic hypertension uAOBP was within the normal range (<95th pc for OBP), in six of nine children with whitecoat diastolic hypertension uAOBP was within the normal range however, in three of them it was elevated despite normal ABP. Conclusions: uAOBP measurement is feasible in school-aged children, its values are considerably lower than OBP as well as daytime ABP and it could help with detection of white-coat systolic hypertension. The clinical applicability of uAOBP in children should be confirmed in further studies.",1.0,clinical,True

143,"Introduction: Complement activation plays a central role in the pathophysiology of glomerulonephritis. This study aimed to determine if urine and plasma levels of soluble terminal complement complex C5b-9 (sC5b9) reflect complement activity defined by C5b-9 deposits associated with glomerular and tubular histological lesions. Material and methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 61 kidney biopsy samples in children between 2018 and 2021.Urine and plasma samples were collected just before the kidney biopsy, to assess standard biochemical assays, plasma and urine sC5b-9. Biopsy specimens were examined in a blinded fashion by two operators using indirect immunohistochemistry against C5b-9 in paraffin-embedded sections. We quantified glomerular and tubular deposition of C5b-9 and calculated scores for active and chronic lesions. Chronic lesions were defined by percentage of glomerular sclerosis, segmental hyalin glomerular lesions and atrophic tubules. Active lesions were characterized by all other, non-chronic, lesions. Results: Median (interquartile range) age of patients at biopsy was 14 (9, 16) years. Seventeen (28%) were follow-up kidney transplant biopsies. Median eGFR (defined the Schwartz formula) was 89 (77, 99) ml/min/ 1.73 m2. Median plasma sC5b-9 was 166 (124, 273) ng/ml, and median urine sC5b-9 to creatinine ratio was 1.28 (0.56, 2.69) ng/mmol.

148,"Introduction: The genetic predisposition for typical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is largely unknown. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL2) is associated with endothelial dysfunction and its inhibition protects against complement activation and renal injury induced by Stx-2 in mice models. We report 3 cases of typical HUS with presence of MBL2 gene polymorphisms. Material and methods: DNA next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis was performed on peripheral blood samples from 3 patients with typical HUS secondary to shiga-toxin producing E.Coli (STEC) infection. Amplicons covered exonic regions of TMA- associated genes (CFH, CFI, CFB, CFD, C3, CD55, MCP, thrombomodulin, ADAMTS13, MASP, MBL and FCN). Results: Two male patients of 8 and 9 months old and one female patient of 5.5 years old presented typical HUS with positive detection of stx by PCR in fecal specimen. Initial soluble C5b-9 levels were increased only in the female patient (920 ng/ml, normal range <245 ng/ml). All three patients required peritoneal dialysis for 14, 15 and 37 days respectively and remained oligo-anuric for 2, 4 and 16 days respectively. The first male patient presented an episode of tonico-clonic seizure at admission, with favorable clinical outcome and normal MRI findings. The female patient presented a severe hemorrhagic colitis, which was gradually resolved. The DNA NGS analysis revealed MBL-2 polymorphisms in the three patients: rs5030737, rs1800450 and rs5030737 respectively. Conclusions: Three patients with typical HUS presented MBL-2 gene polymorphisms in DNA NGS analysis.

All forms of hemolytic uremic syndromes arise from vascular endothelial cell injury of the microvasculature of the kidney and other organs through complementdependent or complement-independent mechanisms. The underlying genetic etiology has not been identified in 30% to 40% of all cases of aHUS, which indicates that there are still unknown etiologies. Material and methods: We described six children from four consanguineous pedigrees, affected with microcephaly and craniofacial malformations, severe growth failure, intellectual retardation, and aHUS that progressed to end stage kidney disease requiring kidney replacement therapy within the first decade of life. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was perfomed to identify underlying genetic etiology. Results: Our research identified a homozygous intronic variant in the gene TSEN2 (tRNA splicing endonuclease subunit 2) associated with this undescribed new syndrome. Bulk RNA sequencing of peripheral blood cells of four affected individuals revealed abnormal tRNA transcripts, indicating an alteration of the tRNA biogenesis. Morpholino-mediated skipping of exon 10 of tsen2 in zebrafish produced phenotypes similar to human patients. Conclusions: We have identified a novel syndrome accompanied by aHUS that suggests the existence of a link between tRNA biology and vascular endothelium homeostasis. We propose to name it TRACK syndrome (TSEN2 Related Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, Craniofacial malformations, Kidney failure).",1.0,case,True

Age and sex related SD scores (SDS) were calculated for serum phosphate and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, and renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate per glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR). Results: At baseline, all patients presented with profound hypophosphatemia (-4.5 SDS), reduced TmP/GFR (-6.5 SDS), and elevated ALP (2.7 SDS, each p<0.001 versus healthy children) suggesting persisting rickets despite long-term therapy with oral phosphate and active vitamin D. Burosumab treatment resulted in rapid increases in mean serum phosphate and TmP/GFR by approx. 0.3 mmol/l amounting to -2.2 SDS and -2.5 SDS at 12 months, respectively (each p<0.001 versus baseline). This was paralleled by a continuous decrease in serum ALP (1.3 SDS, p<0.001 versus baseline). Serum phosphate, TmP/GFR, and ALP values were normalized ind approximately 40%, 30% and 80% of patients, respectively. Two patients had transient hyperphosphatemia due to a dosing error. At 12 months, the median burosumab dosage amounted to 0.8 mg/kg (range 0.6-1.2). Serum phosphate levels at 12 months were comparable between children (-2.3 SDS) and adolescents (-2.1 SDS) and associated with parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Serum ALP z-scores were associated with PTH levels in adolescents but not in children. Conclusions: In this real world setting 12 months burosumab treatment was effective to normalize serum ALP levels in children and adolescents with XLH suggesting healing of rickets despite persisting mild hypophosphatemia in about half of patients.

164,"Introduction: Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is a group of rare, autosomal recessive, inborn errors of metabolism resulting in excessive production of oxalate that can lead to nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, renal failure, and systemic oxalosis. PH Type 1 (PH1) is the most common and severe of the subtypes and is caused by a deficiency in the liver-specific peroxisomal enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) due to mutations in the AGXT gene. Deficiency in AGT impairs the transamination of glyoxylate to glycine in hepatic peroxisomes and the accumulated glyoxylate is subsequently metabolized into oxalate. In the metabolic step preceding the transamination of glyoxylate, glycolate oxidase (GO) catalyzes the conversion of glycolate to glyoxylate. Material and methods: GO has been shown to be a safe and efficient target for substrate reduction therapy in PH1. BBP-711 is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of GO. Inhibition of GO is expectded to reduce hepatic oxalate production in PH1, reducing hyperoxaluria and its sequelae. Results: In healthy adult volunteers, BBP-711 had a PK profile to support once daily dosing, and an acceptable safety profile. BBP-711 is a potent inhibitor of GO, resulting in plasma glycolate concentrations comparable to case reports of individuals with germline HAO1 deletions, suggesting near complete GO inhibition. Conclusions: This global, seamless Phase 2/3 study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of BBP-711 in children and adults with PH1. The study will consist of two parts. Part A will include a dose-finding period to identify a well-tolerated therapeutic dose for Part B. Part B will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, trial in patients with PH1 not requiring renal replacement therapy.

From 1st July 2021 to 31st January 2022 we evaluated antiSpike-protein antibody response at T0 (before vaccine), at T1 and T2 (14±3 days after 2nd and 3rd doses respectively) of BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna). Exclusion criteria were: KT or other IS within 6 months; relapse of primary kidney disease; vaccine before KT; ongoing COVID-19. Results: 87 patients were eligible; 68 (45M) patients were enrolled. Median age was 19.5 (IQR: 16.3-21.9) years; median time from KT was 61.4 (IQR: 36.7-111.7) months. Anti-spike total Ig titer was considered undetectable if <0.8 U/ml, (Roche® Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S). At T0 14 pts (21.5%; data in 65 pts) had a positive titer (median: 211.5 U/mL IQR:147-829); among them five had a history of SARSCov2. Five patients dropped out of study after enrollment. At T1 35 pts (63.6%; data in 55 pts) and at T2 44 pts (90.0%; data in 49 pts) seroconverted or enhanced titer, if previously immunized (median:1256 U/mL; IQR:308.00-13000 and 3662 U/mL; IQR: 193-13000, respectively). 55% of non-responders at T1 seroconverted after the third dose. Patients that experienced COVID-19 before vaccination developed significantly higher antibody titer (median 13000 vs 3.7 p<0.05). No patient had side effects, including acute rejection or DSAs.

Material and methods: We analysed clinical datasets of 605 ARPKD patients from the ARegPKD registry study. Kidney survival and yearly eGFR loss were analysed in the overall cohort as well as in subgroup analyses in children with kidney survival >1.0 years. Results: Ten-year kidney survival differed relevantly according to the factors prematurity (gestational age at birth <37 weeks; 48% vs. 79%), prenatal renal cysts (55% vs. 83%), prenatal renal hyperplasia (50% vs. 83%), oligo-/anhydramnios (50% vs. 86%), age at diagnosis (47% if prenatal diagnosis, 70% if diagnosis within first year of life, 93% if diagnosis 1.0 year) and postnatal assisted breathing or ventilation (40% vs. 83%). Type of assisted breathing/ventilation is relevant with 10-year-survival of 63% if CPAP, 35% if conventional ventilation and 26% if high-frequency oscillation was applied postnatally. Genetic risk factors are consistent with previously reported results showing worst kidney survival in patients with two Null PKHD1 variants. Mean yearly eGFR loss in all patients with kidney survival >1.0 years was 1.0 ml/min/ 1.73m². Type of assisted breathing/ventilation was consistently relevant for yearly eGFR loss, which was highest in patients with reported highfrequency oscillation ventilation (1.9 ml/min/1.73m²) and lowest in patients without perinatal assisted breathing/ventilation (0.8 ml/min/ 1.73m²).

It is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC12A3, encoding the Na+-Cl- cotransporter (NCC) expressed in the distal convoluted tubule. However, for approximately 10 percent of GS patients, the genotype still remains unknown. Material and methods: Mitochondrial DNA variants were identified in three families with Gitelman-like electrolyte abnormalities, then 156 families were investigated for variants in MT-TI and MT-TF encoding the transfer RNAs for phenylalanine and isoleucine. Mitochondrial respiratory chain function was assessed in patient fibroblasts and mitochondrial dysfunction induced in HEK293 cells to assess the effect on NCCmediated 22Na+ transport. Results: Genetic investigations revealed four mtDNA variants in near homoplasmic state in 13 families. Importantly, affected members of six families with an MT-TF variant additionally suffered from progressive chronic kidney disease. Dysfunction of oxidative phosphorylation complex IV and reduced maximal mitochondrial respiratory capacity were found in patient fibroblasts. In vitro pharmacological inhibition of complex IV, mimicking the effect of the mtDNA variants, inhibited NCC phosphorylation and NCCmediated sodium uptake.

202,"Introduction: In children with Steroid Sensitive Nephrotic Syndrome (SSNS), relapse after the first flare occurs in 80% of cases, whatever the dosage or duration of initial steroid therapy. Therefore, there is an unmet need for early interventions to reduce incidence of early relapses. Levamisole is an antihelmintic drug with an immunomodulatory action that reduces relapses in children with Frequent Relapses or Steroid Dependant NS. NEPHROVIR-3 is the first trial to assess the efficacy of levamisole in increasing duration of initial remission after the diagnosis of INS. Material and methods: NEPHROVIR-3 is a multicentric placebocontrolled randomized trial (1:1), in 38 centers of the Paris area, France. Patients were included at INS diagnosis and randomized, when steroid sensitive within 4 weeks, to receive either levamisole 2.5 mg/kg/48h or placebo for 6 months, in addition to the French steroid protocol (18 weeks-3990mg/m2). Primary outcome was the relapse-free survival at 1 year. The effect of the study drug was analysed by a Cox proportional hazard model stratified on centre. Results: Between September 2017 and February 2020, 86 patients were included, median age at INS onset was 5 yrs (IQ 3-7), with 69% of boys. At 4 weeks, 68 of them were randomized. Median time to remission was 8.5 days (IQ 6-12). Relapse-free survival at 12 months was 53.8% (95%IC 34.7-69.5) in the levamisole group versus 20.9% (7.2-39.4) in the placebo group (p,0.007). The risk of relapse associated with levamisole was HR ,0.37 (95%IC 0.15-0.89). Treatment was well tolerated with one interruption in each group because of skin rash. Conclusions: Early treatment with levamisole at the first flare of childhood SSNS is well tolerated and significantly improves relapse-free survival at 1 year.",1.0,case,True

208,"Introduction: Over the last decades, advances in genetic techniques have resulted in the identification of rare hereditary disorders of renal magnesium and salt handling. Nevertheless, ±20% of all tubulopathy patients remain without genetic diagnosis. Here, we explore a large multicentric patient cohort with a novel inherited salt-losing tubulopathy, hypomagnesemia and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Material and methods: Whole exome and genome sequencing was performed with subsequent functional analyses of identified RRAGD variants in vitro. Results: In 8 children from unrelated families with a tubulopathy characterized by hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, saltwasting, and nephrocalcinosis, we identified heterozygous missense variants in RRAGD that mostly occurred de novo. Six of these patients additionally suffered from DCM requiring heart transplantation in 3 of them. An additional dominant variant in RRAGD was simultaneously identified in eight members of a large family with a similar renal phenotype. RRAGD encodes GTPase RagD mediating amino acid signaling to the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Identified RRAGD variants were shown to induce an increased interaction with components of mTORC1 and a constitutive activation of mTOR signaling in vitro. Conclusions Our findings establish a novel disease phenotype combining kidney tubulopathy and cardiomyopathy caused by an activation of mTOR signaling suggesting a critical role of Rag GTPase D for renal electrolyte handling and cardiac function.",1.0,disease,True

The International XLH patient Registry was established to provide information on the natural history of XLH and impact of treatment on patient outcomes. Data are from the first interim analysis conducted on baseline data from paediatric subjects (age <18y). Material and methods: The XLH Registry (NCT03193476) was initiated in August 2017, aims to recruit 1,200 children and adults with XLH, and will run for 10 years. At time of analysis (Last Patient In: 30/11/2020; database lock: 29/03/2021), subjects diagnosed with XLH were enrolled from 81 hospital sites in 16 countries. Parameters collected at baseline included demographics, medical and treatment history, and clinical presentation data. Results: Overall, 360 children were included in this analysis; 61.7% were female. Mean (SD) age was 9.5y (±4.5). Treatment data at entry were available for 281 subjects: among those 58.7% were receiving burosumab (165/281); 40.6% conventional therapy (phosphate salts and active vitamin D) (114/281); 0.7% had no treatment reported (2/281). Among 330 paediatric subjects with reported genetic data, 72.4% had a genetic test, of whom 88.7% had a confirmed PHEX mutation. Data on XLH family history were available for 319 subjects; biological mother was affected in 164 (51.4%); biological father was affected in 49/317 (15.5%). Across all age groups males and females with XLH presented with decreased standardized height (z-score: -1.63±1.22; n,307) yet `normal' standardized weight (z-score: -0.02±1.35; n,""326), resulting in an elevated body mass index (z-score: 1.37±2.285; n"",249) suggesting obesity. Conclusions: This is the largest data set of children with XLH collected to date. Short stature and obesity appear as frequent complications throughout childhood.

229,"Introduction: Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) is the most common glomerular disease in children, with immune-related pathogenesis. Corticosteroids are the first-line treatment, but patients not responsive may progress to end-stage renal disease. The identification of a biomarker signature to predict treatment efficacy will be useful to redefine INS patients' classification based on individual immune profiles, rather than on response to treatment. Material and methods: PBMCs, sera and urines were obtained from thirty INS children (steroid-sensitive and resistant) at different timepoints (onset, remission, relapse) and seven young healthy donors (HS). The dynamics of the changes in the immune repertoire were detected by flow cytometry. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) concentration and morphology were analysed by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis and Transmission Electron Microscopy. Molecular analyses (lipidomic and proteomics) were conducted on Size Exclusion Chromatography isolated EVs. Results: No significant differences were observed in the total CD19+ B lymphocytes in INS children with active proteinuria in respect to the HS, whereas their levels were significantly enhanced compared with remission state. INS patients show higher levels of naïve and switched memory B cells compared to HS (p <0.05), that were maintained elevated during remission. Focused on the steroid-sensitive INS group, transitional B cells decreased and plasmablasts and plasma cells increased in these patients compared to the same group in remission (p <0.05). In the T cell compartment, we detected a significant increase of Th2 and Th17/Th1 ratio in proteinuric INS in respect to HS, and higher levels of Foxp3+ T reg during remission (p <0.05). NTA analysis revealed no differences in EV concentration. Biofluid INS-EVs expressed tetraspanins with a heterogeneous distribution among the patients' subgroups; the highest expression was observed during remission. Serum INS-EVs showed an increase in lymphocytic markers, that were already detected in EVs at the disease onset. Urine INS-EVs were enriched of adhesion, epithelial and leucocyte molecules, and their number positively correlated with proteinuria levels. Conclusions: Changes in the biofluid EV profile embody the bloodstream immune dysfunctions, supporting their possible participation in INS pathophysiology.",1.0,disease,True

The specific impact of phosphate and its phosphaturic hormones fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 and parathyroid hormone (PTH) on tubular cell damage was investigated using HK-2 human proximal tubular (PT) cells. Results: HPD in mice caused hyperphosphatemia, hyperphosphaturia, increased FGF23, PTH and creatinine levels and albuminuria. Histopathological analysis revealed progressive PT injury in HPD-fed mice from two months onwards followed by a rapid progression from month 5 to 6. This was accompanied by increased tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The kidney injury marker Kim-1 increased in PT of HPD-fed mice, which was positively associated with tubular injury score and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Histological staining revealed increased number of pStat3+ cells that was positively associated with Kim-1 synthesis. Concomittantly, the chemokine MCP-1 was upregulated in PT of HPD-fed mice, which was associated with Kim-1 expression indicating an interaction between pStat3/Kim-1 signaling and MCP-1. HPD caused enhanced macrophage recruitment to injured PT that was associated with increased MCP-1 synthesis and increased tubular injury score. Stimulation of HK-2 cells with FGF23 or high phosphate, but not PTH, induced the phosphorylation of Stat3. Interestingly, only high phosphate significantly upregulated Kim-1 and MCP-1 expression. Conclusions: Chronic high phosphate load leads to progressive PT damage caused by Stat3/Kim-1 signaling activation mediating MCP-1dependent macrophage recruitment. Our data indicate that high phosphate intake may cause a global health problem and the demand for clinical studies on this issue.",1.0,positive,True

Continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT) is the treatment of choice in critically ill children with AKI. One of the great challenges with CKRT is early coagulation of the circuit. Material and methods: Since December 2018, we have treated fifty critically ill children admitted in pediatric intensive care units with CKRT using regional citrate anticoagulation. Diagnosis for these patients were several, including septic shock, acute kidney injury, liver failure and hematological disorders. Patients were mainly male, mean age was 75.4 ± 77.5 months with mean body weight of 22.7 ± 22.8 kg. Twenty-seven patients were below 15 kg and fourteen patients were below 10 kg. Eleven patients had severe hepatic impairment and received a reduced dose of citrate. Results: The mean filter lifetime was 54.5 ± 18.2 hours with 70.6% of circuits lasting more than 48 hours and 45.2% of circuits lasting more than 70 hours. The most frequent cause of CKRT interruption was scheduled changes. Interestingly, similar circuit lifetime was also confirmed in the low weight sub-population ( 10 kg), 54.3 ± 19.2 hours. In our experience among metabolic complication, in contrast with the adult population metabolic acidosis was more common than metabolic alkalosis. We found no case of citrate accumulation, even in those patient with hepatic failure.

We finally included 3 studies with a mean participants' age 13.79 ± 4.35 years. Among three studies that reported data on the overall prevalence of LVH in a total of 238 CKD patients with ambulatory hypertension, the prevalence of LVH was found 0.28 (95% CI, 0.19, 0.39) . In four studies (including the three studies mentioned) including 172 CKD patients with masked hypertension, LVH was detected in 49 patients, with the estimated prevalence being 0.23 (95%CI, 0.15, 0.32). Conclusions: Our data emphasize the growing evidence on the important role of echocardiography and ambulatory BP monitoring to evaluate cardiovascular risk in children with CKD . Diagnosis of masked hypertension carries an adverse prognosis, with increased risk of LVH and associated future cardiovascular events.",1.0,mask,True

268,"Introduction: In the presence of hypertension in children, physicians should strive to find a diagnosis. Orthostatic hypertension (OHT) and postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) signal an abnormality in cardiovascular autonomic control mechanisms and might mimic pheochromocytoma because of the paroxysms of hyperadrenergic symptoms. Material and methods: A 14-year old boy with a congenital solitary kidney presented with fatigue and paroxysmal headache, lightheadedness and palpitations for the past 6 months. Blood pressure (BP) was 160/80 mmHg. Results: Complete blood count, serum electrolytes and serum creatinine were within normal reference range. Renal Doppler ultrasound was normal. He had no target-organ damage: heart ultrasound and fundoscopy were normal, proteinuria was negative. 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring found normal daytime and nighttime averages and revealed diurnal spikes of the systolic BP of more than 160 mmHg. 24-h urinary normetanephrine level was 5 times the normal amount. The patient underwent PET scanning to detect and localize the suspected pheochromocytoma, but no hypermetabolic activity was found. Further clinical examination found orthostatic tachycardia with concomitant orthostatic hypertension. Noradrenaline was measured after drawing a blood sample in both a supine and a standing position. The patient had a massive elevation of plasma noradrenaline in the standing position. 10-minute tilt and stand tests induced symptoms as well as modifications in heart rate and BP. The patient needed a triple hypotensive therapy (beta-blockers, 1-blockers, central sympatholytics) as well as non-pharmacological treatment (sophrology) in order to control symptoms. Conclusions: PoTS and OHT are disorders of the autonomic nervous system that can produce substantial disability among otherwise healthy people. The clinical picture of PoTS and OHT can be confused with pheochromocytoma. While the latter requires urgent medical attention, PoTS and OHT are considered to be benign conditions. However, OHT in children might herald sustained arterial hypertension later in life, therefore close follow-up is needed.",1.0,negative,True

273,"Introduction: Obesity is a major childhood health problem. Central or abdominal obesity has been linked to various complications, such as high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, constituting the so-called ""metabolic syndrome"". Early ultrasound study of carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) could detect subclinical atherosclerotic lesions. In the pediatric age, studies related to obesity, cardiovascular risk factors and atherosclerosis are limited.To determine the CIMT of both common carotids as a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis by ultrasound measurement in obese children and children with a normal body mass index (BMI) and to determine its relationship with variables related to cardiovascular risk. Material and methods: Observational case-control study. We studied 69 children of both sexes, between 6 and 14 years old, with a diagnosis of obesity or body mass index (BMI) higher than +2 SD of the mean according to the reference population. A control group of 76 healthy children with similar characteristics was assigned. A history of cardiovascular risk in first-degree relatives was analyzed. In both study groups, somatometry was performed with determination of BMI and waist circumference and complete physical examination with measurement of blood pressure, as well as the determination of analytical parameters related to childhood obesity. Obese children underwent oral glucose overload and abdominal ultrasound and, for all children, carotid ultrasound to determine CIMT Results: Obese children showed significantly (p<0.001) a higher frequency of high blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia, decreased HDL-c and insulin resistance compared to non-obese children.The mean CIMT was higher in obese children (0.46±0.09 for the right carotid and 0.45 ±0.09 for the left carotid) than in healthy children (0.33±0.04 on the right and 0.36±0.04 on the left) (p<0.001). These differences were present since prepubertal times (<0.001). Of these, BMI was the variable that was independently associated with the CIMT of both carotids (p< 0.001). The right CIMT was higher in obese patients with hyperuricemia (p,0.039) and insulin resistance (p,0.01).. Children with hepatic steatosis (50% of obese patients) had a higher CIMT for both carotids (p,""0.003) compared to obese children with normal liver ultrasounds. Likewise, the presence of hepatic steatosis was independently associated with increased thickness of the right (p"",0.002) and left (p,""0.001) intima media. Conclusions: The obese subjects in the sample presented a higher frequency of parameters associated with cardiovascular risk. The thickness of the intima media of both carotids was significantly higher in both prepubertal and pubescent obese children relative to non-obese children.The thickness of the intima media of both carotids was directly correlated with multiple variables related to cardiovascular risk, with BMI and the presence of hepatic steatosis being the variables that showed an independent association with the CIMT of both carotid arteries.""",1.0,clinical,True

Part of these patients receives pharmacological treatment. The aim of the study was to evaluate the pharmacological treatment of children and adolescents in Lithuania and to compare the treatment choices in 2015 - before the release of 2016 European Society of Hypertension guidelines for the management of high blood pressure (BP) in children and adolescents and after - in 2019. Material and methods: Big data was extracted from Lithuanian National Health Insurance Fund database for prescriptions covered by insurance for children from 0 to 17 years of age in the year of 2015 and 2019 for primary and secondary AH. Patients were divided in 0-3, 4-7, 8-12, 12-17 age groups. Antihypertensive medications were grouped by their pharmacological class: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta blockers (BB), calcium channel blockers (CCB), diuretics, imidazoline receptor agonists, alpha-blockers, combined ACEi and diuretics. Results: 1382 prescriptions were done in 2015 and 1233 in 2019 for AH. ACEi were the first choice for primary and secondary AH in all age groups, while BB were in the second place. ARBs were the third or the fourth choice depending on the age group. Enalapril was the most common in ACEi group, while Metoprolol in BB. The pharmacological treatment options did not differ in compared years. Conclusions: BB are used more often as antihypertensive agents than they should be, while ARBs are underused.

Mobile apps may serve as simple, time-saving and cheap tool to facilitate self-management in CKD patients and may be an attractive option in the pediatric population. We aimed to create a mobile app for pediatric CKD patients dedicated to monitor patient-reported CKD-specific health status and to improve self-care. Material and methods: Following the analysis of scientific literature on self-management interventions for CKD patients, a mobile app NephroGo (Android and iOS compatible) was developed using Pythonbased Django WEB system and Flutter technology. The adult version was updated to address pediatric CKD issues. Nutrition guidance was based on the updated Pediatric Renal Nutrition Taskforce Recommendations and a personalized counter of nutrients with a database of food composition was created. Results: Health status tracker helps to conveniently store data on blood pressure, urine output, weight, height/length and to monitor the dynamics of well-being. The personalized counter of nutrients and nutrition tracking feature helps patients to find out how much nutrients they have consumed and helps to follow CKD-stage appropriate diet. In addition, the app allows to monitor peritoneal dialysis parameters and provides patientrelevant CKD-specific information. Conclusions: NephroGo may be an attractive mobile health application to aid and improve self-care and CKD-specific knowledge in children with CKD and their families.

294,"Introduction: Primary headache, one of the most common complaints in children may have elevated blood pressure (BP) load even if the office blood pressure measurements are normal and this may have a role in the etiology of primary headache. Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) is an effective and non-invasive tool to diagnose hypertension and identifying risk groups for cardiovascular disease. Herein, we aimed to evaluate ABPM in children followed up with Primary Headache. Material and methods: Children aged 8-17 years, who diagnosed with primary headache and had office blood pressure below the 95th percentile were included. Age and gender matched healthy control group is also involved. The 24-hour ABPM was performed to the children in the patient and control groups Demographic data, office blood pressures and ABPM results were compared between the patient and control groups. Results: Our study included 37 patients diagnosed with Primary Headache (30 migraine, 7 tension-type headache) and 37 healthy children in the control group. the patient and control groups were similar in case of age, gender and SDSs of body weight, height, body mass index and office blood pressure. The ABPM data showed significantly elevated total systolic blood pressure (SBP), daytime SBP, nocturnal SBP, nocturnal systolic load, and nocturnal diastolic load in the study group compare to the control group. There was no difference between groups in terms of total diastolic blood pressure (DBP), daytime DBP, nocturnal DBP, total mean arterial pressure (MAP), daytime MAP, nocturnal MAP, daytime systolic load, daytime diastolic load, systolic dipping and diastolic dipping. Conclusions: Children who apply to the hospital with a complaint of headache may have abnormal ABPM parameters although they have normal office blood pressure. These children may need to be evaluated to identify risk groups for hypertension and cardiovascular disease.",1.0,disease,True

300,"Introduction: Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare but severe early-onset hepatorenal fibrocystic disease and mainly caused by variants in the PKHD1 gene. Ductal plate malformation as mandatory aspect of the disease is the pathophysiologic basis for development of congenital hepatic fibrosis, which leads to clinical signs of portal hypertension. Here, we aimed to describe the hepatic phenotype of ARPKD patients. Material and methods: We analysed clinical datasets of 605 ARPKD patients from the ARegPKD registry study for their hepatic characteristics and complications. Portal hypertension was defined as splenomegaly on ultrasound, thrombocytopenia (<150 000/ul), proof of collateral blood flow or a substantial hepatic complication, substantial hepatic complication was defined as occurrence of variceal bleeding, presence of TIPS/surgical portosystemic shunt or isolated liver or combined liverkidney transplantation (LTx, CLKTx). Results: Of the 605 analyzed patients with 1 follow-up visit, median (Q1-Q3) age at initial diagnosis was 0.2 (0.1-1.6) years, median (Q1-Q3) age at first visit was 1.3 (0.2-7.2) years. Most patients initially presented with kidney-related symptoms, but 14/537 patients (3%) presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and 4/557 (1%) with cholangitis. The 5 (10; 20) year survival without signs of portal hypertension was 77% (55%; 25%), without substantial hepatic complication 94% (79%; 58%). In total, 42 children underwent at least one LTx or CLKTx. Median (Q1-Q3) age at first LTx was 8.7 (5.3-22.4) years and at first CLKTx 8.1 (5.4-14.6) years. Conclusions: Only a small fraction of patients initially presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. However, 20-year-survival without signs of portal hypertension was only 25%, without substantial hepatic complication 58%, indicating that a relevant fraction of patients suffers from hepatic symptoms in childhood and adolescence. Further analyses aim to delineate early clinical or biochemical risk markers for a substantial hepatic phenotype to counsel wisely this at-risk group and to improve clinical decision-making.",1.0,disease,True

The iPSCs were subsequently grown into patient-derived kidney organoids using the StemDiff Kidney Organoid Kit (Stemcell Technologies). For cyst formation, PKA signalling inside the cells was amplified by treating the organoids with forskolin according to a protocol of Low et al. Cyst development was monitored by brightfield microscopy and compared to organoids derived from wildtype iPSCs functioning as a healthy control. The development of organ-specific cell types such as podocytes, tubular epithelial cells or endothelial cells was observed via immunofluorescence staining. Results: We were able to prove the development of glomeruli, proximal and distal tubules as well as vascular networks via immunofluorescence staining. While undergoing treatment with forskolin, cyst formation was visible in the patient-derived ARPKD organoids, whereas control organoids seemed to be nearly unaffected by the PKA induction. Conclusions: Our patient-derived organoids are able to depict kidney organogenesis in vitro developing organ-specific structures and celltypes. Furthermore, they can be used as disease-in-a-dish models in which an ARPKD-like phenotype was inducible. This could be the basis of screening cyst-modifying compounds and developing new treatment strategies.

Hypertension occurs also in childhood, with a reported incidence ranging 15% to 44%. In 2008, M. Cadnapaphornchai et al reported increased, although not hypertrophic, left ventricular mass indexed to body surface (LVMI) in hypertensive ADPKD children. Our aim was to evaluate cardiac geometry and function in a cohort of ADPKD children.

Results: Ninety-one patients (46M) were included in the study. The median age at the echocardiography was 11.5 years (1-23 years). Twenty-six (12M) patients started antihypertensive treatment at a median age of 10 years. All had well-controlled blood pressure at the time when echocardiography was performed. Two patients were hypertensive (treatment not yet started). The median LVMI was 33 g ± 7.6 g. No difference was observed between patients treated or not treated for antihypertension (p, 0.771). Two patients had LVI; both were obese. No patient had systolic or diastolic dysfunction. No correlation was observed between LVMI and blood pressure. LVMI and GFR were inversely correlated (r,""-0.54, p<0.01). Conclusions: All our children with ADPKD had normal LVMI and cardiac function, except two obese children.

316,"Introduction: Pediatric ADPKD could benefit from novel disease altering therapies. However, the lack of sensitive and validated endpoints in this population renders clinical trials very challenging. We aimed to evaluate methods for the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in order to identify the most accurate method for this population. Material and methods: Serum creatinine (SCr) and serum Cystatin C (SCysC) were measured in a large cohort of genotyped ADPKD children with long-term follow-up. Commonly used equations for eGFR were compared for their relative performance, using the reference intervals for healthy children. Results: We included 68 genetically confirmed ADPKD children (sex ratio 1:1) with a mean age of 10.2 years (min-max: 0-23 years) and with a mean time of follow-up of 3.6 years (1-8 years). SCr was mostly within the reference interval, regardless age and sex. The revised Schwartz formula (CKiD) showed a highly significant and clinically important decline in eGFR with aging (-3.31ml/min/1.73m2/year, p<0.0001). The recently updated equation by the Schwartz group (CKiDU25) showed a smaller (-0.90 mL/min/1.73m²/year) but significant (p,""0.001) decline in eGFR with aging and also showed a significant unexplainable sex difference (p<0.0001). SCr normalized for Q and the related FAS-SCr did not show a clear age or sex dependency (table 1). Finally, CysC based and combined equations were independent of age and sex in this paediatric ADPKD cohort. Conclusions: The CKiD equation, the most widely used method to calculate eGFR in children, and the CKiDU25 were associated with unexpected age and sex differences in the young ADPKD population. In contrast, FAS-SCr, FAS-CysC and the combined FAS equation which are all normalized by Q, showed an age and sex independency and might therefore be more reliable to monitor kidney function in this population. This finding could help future design of the upcoming clinical trials.""",1.0,disease,True

Material and methods: In 44 children with TSC (age 2 years, mean age 8.26±5.52 years), we evaluated estimated GFR using simplified creatinine-based Schwartz formula (eGFRCr) and creatinine-, urea-, and cystatin C-based Schwartz formula (eGFRCrUrCys) [mL/min/1.73m2]. Hyperfiltration was defined as eGFR >140 mL/min/1.73m2. In all patients, we also analyzed clinical and biochemical data and renal lesions by measuring the largest lesion diameter (angiomyolipoma - AML and cysts). Results: 34 (77.3%) patients had renal AMLs, including 6 with large AMLs (>30 mm) and 36 (81.8%) had renal cysts. eGFRCr was from 96 to 230, mean 140.1±31.8, eGFRCrUrCys was from 82 to 153, mean 111.0 ±15.6 mL/min/1.73m2. The difference between eGFRCr and eGFRCrUrCys was from 0.18 to 88.8, mean 30.0±20.8 mL/min/ 1.73m2. Hyperfiltration was found in 17 (38.6%) using eGFRCr and in 2 (4.5%) using eGFRCrUrCys. Serum cystatin C varied from 0.53 to 1.45, mean 0.84±0.20 [mg/L], and was normal in all but three (6.8%) children. There was no difference between patients with hyperfiltration (defined using eGFRCr) and patients with normal eGFRCr in age, sex, biochemical parameters, and renal lesions. eGFRCr and the difference between eGFRCr and eGFRCrUrCys correlated with age (r,""-0.387, p"",0.009; r,""0.479, p<0.001) whereas there was no such correlation for eGFRCrUrCys. Conclusions: 1. Children with TSC have normal kidney function, even with very large kidney lesions. 2. The simplified Schwartz formula does not accurately assess renal function in children with TSC and may lead to overdiagnosis of hyperfiltration, especially in the youngest patients. 3. Cystatin C -based evaluation of eGFR should be routinely used in pediatric TSC patients.""",1.0,clinical,True

The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of HT in children with ADPKD and reveal the relationship between MRI-based kidney volumes, blood pressures (BP) and kidney functions. Material and methods: This cross-sectional, single-center study included 89 patients (39 girls, 50 boys) diagnosed with ADPKD, and age- and sex-matched 27 healthy children (13 girls, 14 boys) as controls. BP was determined by both office measurements and 24-hour ambulatory BP measurements. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated from serum creatinine and cystatin C levels using the CKiD equation. The MRI-based total kidney volumes (TKV) of the patients were measured with the manual planimetry method, and corrected by the patient's height. Results: The median age of patients was 6.9 years, with a median followup of 5.2 years. 79 children had a genetically proven diagnosis, whereas 10 children were diagnosed with clinical characteristic. Mean eGFR of the children with ADPKD (112 ml/min/1.73m2) was significantly lower than the control group. None of the patients had an eGFR <90 ml/min/ 1.73m2.

400,"Introduction: Despite progress in the management and treatment of acute kidney disease (AKI), it is still a life-threatening entity with increasing prevalence. Regardless the etiology of AKI, a change in conventionally used marker creatinine occurs within several hours or days after damaging insult. This might limit early diagnostics of AKI and increase the risk of irreversible kidney scarring and progression to end-stage renal disease. Recently, extracellular DNA (ecDNA) is gaining popularity as a non-specific marker of tissue damage. ecDNA is released from disintegrated cell (apoptosis, necrosis, NETosis) into various body fluids including plasma and urine. Although several studies described its increased concentrations in AKI, no study rigorously investigated ecDNA in different AKI causes. Thus, we aimed to describe ecDNA concentrations and activity of DNAse in children with different etiologies of AKI as well as in animal models. Material and methods: In the study were included 28 children with AKI (9.67 ± 6.29) and 27 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (aged 8.57 ± 4.30 years). Patients were diagnosed with glomerulonephritis (GN - 11%), tubulo-interstitial nephritis (TIN - 40%), atypical hemolyticuremic syndrome (aHUS - 30%) and other etiologies (19%). In the experimental part, the models of adenine nephropathy (n ,"" 30), HUS (n "","" 30), ischemia-reperfusion injury (n "","" 14), and 5/6 nephrectomy (n "","" 24) were studied. Total ecDNA concentrations were determined using fluorescent method (Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Nuclear (ncDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were quantified by real-time PCR. Results: Plasma ecDNA and ncDNA were significantly higher in AKI patients compared to controls (ecDNA: 5-fold higher, p<0.001; ncDNA: 10-fold higher, p<0.05). When comparing various etiologies of AKI, plasma ecDNA was significantly increased in TIN and HUS. Interestingly, ncDNA and mtDNA did not differ between AKI causes. Urinary ncDNA was higher in AKI patients compared to controls (800fold, p<0.05). However, there was no difference in urinary ecDNA, ncDNA and mtDNA between different causes of AKI. Further, no difference in DNase activity between patients and controls was found. In animal models, increased plasma ecDNA was observed in adenine nephropathy (5-fold), HUS (4-fold) and IRI (1.5-fold) but not in 5/6 nephrectomy. Accordingly, similar results were observed in urinary ecDNA together with decreased DNase activity in AKI animals. Conclusions: Results of the clinical part and the animal experiment indicate that increase in ecDNA in AKI is cause dependent. The higher concentration of ecDNA observed only in tubulo-interstitial nephritis and aHUS is probably related to the development of inflammation. Limitation of this study is low number of participants in subgroups of different AKI etiologies. Further studies involving more patients should elucidate the role of inflammation in ecDNA releasing in different causes of AKI.

405,"Introduction: Our goal was to investigate the influence of the degree of obesity on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) parameters in selected group of office normotensive obese children and adolescents. This study is unique because it is the first one which included only obese office normotensive patients in order to establish if the deviation in ambulatory BP parameters is proportional to the increasing body mass index (BMI). Material and methods: In total, 119 obese patients (55 males, 46.2%) aged 7-18 years (mean 14.22 years), divided into 3 groups based on their BMI Z-score were included in our study. They all underwent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Results: This study shows that obese patients, even if office normotensive, have alterations in BP values obtained by ABPM. We found a positive correlation between systolic and diastolic BP and BMI in our patients (p 0.001), however there was no correlation between this parameters on the level of different BMI subgroups. Daytime blood pressure load correlated with rising BMI and was higher in groups II and III compared to group I (p<0.001). BMI category did not influence the dipping pattern in our subjects although most of our subjects (66.4%) showed non-dipping pattern for systolic BP. The difference in BPV was confirmed only for daytime systolic and diastolic values between groups I and II (p,0.019 and p,""0.002, respectively). Conclusions: Systolic and diastolic BP values obtained by ABPM in office normotensive obese children and adolescents are higher in subjects with higher BMI. Patients with increased BMI have increased daytime blood pressure variability and higher percentage of BP readings above 95th percentile. Obese patients show non-dipping pattern, independently on the rising BMI category. This study shows the importance of performing ABPM in obese, office normotensive patients, in order to promptly recognize individuals with higher cardiovascular risk and assure early intervention.""",1.0,flu,True

Results: We showed that males exhibited kidney overgrowth from five weeks of age. This effect was organ-specific, since liver and heart weight were comparable between males and females, regardless of age. Consistently, androgen receptor was expressed in male kidney, but not in liver. In growing mice, androgens led to kidney overgrowth by first inducing a burst of cell proliferation and then an increase of cell size.

Androgens also enhanced in vivo and in vitro renal autophagy, very likely by increasing TFEB nuclear translocation. Functionally, the increase of tubular mass resulted in increased sodium/phosphate transport. These findings were relevant to humans. Indeed, by studying living gender-paired kidney donors-recipients, we showed that tubular cell size increased three months after transplantation in men as compared to women, regardless of the donor gender. Conclusions: Collectively, these results identify novel signaling pathways that may be involved in androgens-induced kidney growth and homeostasis and suggest that androgens determine kidney size during physiological growth and after transplantation. Thus, targeting these pathways might lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for kidney transplantation.",0.0,,False

415,"Introduction: Molecular characteristics of the most abundant serum protein, albumin, in patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) has not be in the focus of recent research. The observation of a patient with NS, refractory to all therapeutic interventions, before and after kidney transplantation clearly points toward malfunction of human serum albumin (HAS) as a remission could repeatedly be achieved by extremely high albumin infusion. Material and methods: After excluding a mutation in the albumin encoding gene, we set out to characterize the molecular physicochemical properties of serum albumin in patients with MCNS and FSGS by employing dynamic light scattering (DLS), electrophoretic light scattering (ELS), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. An EPR-active stearic acid (16-DSA) was added to serum samples in in HSA:16-DSA ratios of 1:2, 1:4, and 1:6, probing mainly the high affinity (1:2) or globally up to almost all fatty acid binding sites of albumin. Results: EPR spectroscopy has shown that fatty acids binding behavior to HSA is significantly different in diseased and healthy HSA [1, 2]. We found changes in the local environment and binding capacity of HSA in NS patients, especially pronounced in the patient with steroid resistant type of NS. These changes are correlated with variations of HSA surface potential/charge as investigated by DLS/ELS. Conclusions: Our results show profound functional changes in serum albumin from patients with NS, like an increased hydrodynamic radius, a less negative surface potential and lower binding affinity to 16-DSA even at 1:2 ratio. Whether these changes are caused by other serum factors, loss of the binding capacity of podocyte toxic factors, or if albumin with less negative surface potential is prone to filtering through the glomerular basement membrane are subject to further research.

429,"Introduction: Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency causes many organ dysfunctions, with isolated kidney involvement leading to chronic kidney disease in some subtypes. Early administration of oral CoQ10 has been observed to reduce proteinuria and has been postponed the onset of chronic kidney disease in these patients, suggesting that it may have renoprotective properties. On the other hand, the limited bioavailability of CoQ10 in mitochondria is an obstacle to its effectiveness. Material and methods We aimed to formulate mitochondria targetted CoQ10-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-triphenylphosphonium nanoparticles (CoQ10-TPP-NPs) that may be used to treat CoQ10 nephropathies more effectively. Their effects were evaluated on an in vitro disease model, which was created in HK-2 cell line by siRNA based silencing of the COQ8B. Mitochondrial functions were determined by metabolomic analyses. Results: The size of these nanoparticles was determined to be around 150 nm, with a zeta potential of +20 mV. The entrapment efficiency of the nanoparticles was found to be 40%. It was found that these nanoparticles did not show cytotoxic effects on HK-2 cells. Metabolomic analyses showed increased rate of tricarboxylic acid cycle in COQ8B-/- cells treated with CoQ10-TPP-NPs as compared to those treated with free-CoQ10.

436,"Introduction: Cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal cystine storage disease that stems from defective cystinosin protein caused by mutations in CTNS. The most frequently applied diagnostic method is the confirmation of the increased leukocyte cystine levels. However, this test is expensive, unreproducible and difficult to have an access in everywhere. This study aimed to investigate new biomarkers for the diagnosis and follow-up of this rare disease with multiomics (genomic, proteomic and metabolomic) methods. Material and methods: Multiomic studies have been performed in plasma and urine samples from three pediatric groups; a) newly-diagnosed cystinosis patients (n,""14), b) cystinosis patients under treatment (n"",""31), c) healthy controls (n"",""30) and in d) siRNA based cystinosis model in vitro. Results: Multivariate analysis revealed different plasma and urinary profile between groups. The candidate biomarkers were determined using receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis.

We compared four molMM methods: amino acid mismatch scores (AAMS, assessing T- and B-cell alloimmunity), electrostatic mismatch score-3-dimensional (EMS3D, assessing B-cell alloimmunity), and NetMHCIIpan (T-cell alloimmunity) at HLA-peptide affinity binding thresholds of 500 nM (netMHC) and 1000 nM (netMHC1k as implemented in the PIRCHE algorithm). Results: De novo DSA incidence was highest against HLA-DQ (30/177, 17%, Table 1). Higher antMM and molMM were associated with DSA formation. DSA preferentially targeted the highest scoring molMM allele in each individual patient. MolMM methods were more predictive of DSA compared to antMM (Table 1, AUROC results), and EMS3D was the most consistent predictor across all HLA loci (AUROC 0.72-0.75). Biopsy-proven ABMR (11/177, 6%) was associated with increasing recipient age and class II molMM (defined by AAMS or EMS3D or netMHC). Late TCMR (>6 months postrtansplant) was diagnosed on for-cause biopsies in 23 (13%) patients. Accounting for the total HLA burden, neither molMM nor antMM scores were predictive of TCMR outcome. Stratifying HLA mismatches into low or high risk according to molMM score enabled patient classification into strata. TCMR was significantly associated with HLA-DQ molMM using T-cell algorithms - AAMS (HR 1.8, 95%CI 1.2-3.0 per risk stratum) and netMHC (HR 1.5, 95%CI 1.0-2.2 per risk statum).

454,"Introduction: HLA mismatching has a detrimental effect on graft survival after paediatric kidney transplantation. Assessment of HLA incompatibility at the molecular level (molecular HLA mismatch; molMM) has emerged as a promising method for predicting primary alloimmunity risk. In this study, we aimed to assess whether molMM compared to conventional antigenic mismatching (antMM) enables better prediction of graft function deterioration in paediatric kidney transplantation. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 177 paediatric patients from the ABMR study of the CERTAIN registry (median follow-up 4.5 (IQR 3-5) years). Only five patients experienced graft loss. Therefore, we used the time to 50% reduction in eGFR, from month-3 post-transplant baseline, as a surrogate endpoint for longterm graft loss (eGFR-50). HLA molMM was assessed using the Cambridge amino acid mismatch score (AAMS) which on a separate study was predictive of primary alloimmunity risk in this cohort. Survival analysis was performed using Cox models, adjusted for donor and recipient baseline characteristics. Results: 27 (15%) patients met the primary outcome. In multivariable analysis, recipient and donor age, baseline eGFR, and retransplant status had a significant association with eGFR-50. Importantly, only mismatches at HLA-DQ11, and not at other loci, were associated with the primary outcome (adjusted HR (aHR) 10.2; 95% CI, 10.1-10.4 per 10 AAMS increase, and aHR 1.8; 95% CI, 1.02-3.4 per antigen increase). There was a wide range of AAMS values (0-49) within each HLA-DQ antMM (0-2).

Results: 18 KTRs and 15 controls with a mean age of 19 years were enrolled. 16 KTRs in therapy with steroids, MMF and CNI; 1 with steroids, CNI; 1 with steroids, MPA and CNI. One patient with a previous diagnosis of COVID19 tested positive for anti-capsid. At the first sampling 7/18 (39%) patients had seroconversion; at the second sampling 13/ 18 (72%); 11/12 (92%) at the third sample. KTRs neutralizing antibodies were reduced compared to controls after the second dose (p<0.05); antibody levels became equal only after the booster (p<0.05).

Currently, measuring blood pressure (BP) is the primary method for estimating hemodynamic changes caused by fluid removal (UF). The aim of this study is to assess hemodynamic changes by non-invasive monitoring with electrical velocimetry TM (EV) during hemodialysis (HD) on pediatric patients. Material and methods: Maintenance HD patients of a single pediatric center took part in this study. Anthropometric data, laboratory results and history were collected. Multiple HD sessions were recorded for each patient. Hemodynamic data was measured during HD with an ICON® monitor (Osypka Medical, Germany), BP was recorded every 25 minutes. A BCM device (Fresenius, USA) was used to assess fluid status before and after dialysis. Results: Thirty-eight dialysis sessions of thirteen pediatric patients were included in this study, with 10 (71,42%) males. Median [IQR] age was 15,8 [13,3-16,2] years. Median [IQR] predialytic overhydration was 2,8 [0,4-5,2] percent of dry weight. Significant decrease of stroke volume (SV) (p,""0,015) and thoracic fluid content (TFC) (p<0,0001), as well as increase of heart rate (HR) could be observed, with a correlation to UF: SV (p"",""0,004; Figure 1.), TFC (p<0,0001; Figure 2.), HR (p"",""0,05; Figure 3.). Although cardiac output (CO) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was stable in the whole cohort, subgroup analysis revealed different patterns. Pre- and postdyalitic hypertension was present in 18-18 (47,4-47,4%) patients. No hypotensive event occurred. A 10% change in CO was considered significant.

Material and methods: Prospective observational study including 41 children on HD in three paediatric HD centres in the Paris region. During one session, BIS was performed before the session and serum levels of BNP and NT-proBNP were analysed before and after the session. Results: Median pre-dialysis level of BNP was 87 ng/L [24-192] and NT-proBNP 968 ng/L [442-4828]. Cardiac biomarkers levels showed positive correlation with the BIS hydration status evaluation (p,""0.004). The most appropriate cut-off for pre-dialysis BNP to detect significant overhydration (OH) was 165 ng/L (sensibility 0.67, specificity 0.84). Based on the BIS evaluation, only 32% of patients with high blood pressure (BP) had OH, whereas in the normal BP group, 33% had significant OH. Conclusions: DW prescription for children on HD should not only rely on clinical evaluation, particularly BP, and should include additional helpful parameters. BIS is well validated in children, but it has limitations in non-cooperative patients. Cardiac biomarkers, especially BNP, have proven in this study to be well correlated to hydration status evaluated by BIS, and thus could add precious informations for individual patient management and dry weight assessment.""",1.0,clinical,True

503,"Introduction: End-stage kidney disease is associated with impaired quality of life (QoL). Few studies have investigated the mental health and well-being of children on dialysis. Through validated questionnaires we explored children's and parents' QoL perception and identified risk factors for a concerning score. Material and methods: Participants from the ""3H - HDF-Hearts-Height"" multicentre study in children on hemodialysis (HD) and hemodiafiltration (HDF) completed Paediatric QoL questionnaire (PedsQL) and the Strengths and Difficulties (SDQ) questionnaires. Results: 100 children and parents answered at least one questionnaire and were enrolled in the study. Children on dialysis scored significantly lower for health related QoL on the PedsQL than healthy children (p < 0.001 in all the domains). Differences between children and parents' answers in both questionnaires were not significant in all the domains (p > 0.15). On univariable analysis school attendance significantly reduced the probability of a concerning score, both in children's reported outcomes for emotional (95%CI 0.083 - 0.61; p ,"" 0.003), school (95%IC 0.029 - 0.722; p "", 0.018) and total domain (95%CI 0.023 - 0.49; p , 0.004) and in parents' reports on school (95%CI 0.023 - 0.49; p , 0.035) and total (95%CI 0.04 - 0.85; p , 0.03) domain. Other significant risk factors for having a concerning score were age above 10 years in social and school domains for children (95%CI 1.11 - 12.0; p, 0.032 and 95%CI 1.18 - 15.57; p , 0.027) and in school (95%CI 1.25 - 14.7; p , 0.021) domain for parents; overnight wakes in children's emotional and school domains (95%CI 1.59 - 10.92; p ,"" 0.004 and 95%CI 1.15 - 8.84, p "", 0.026).

Aim of our study was to compare the effect on blood pressure (BP) and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) of a dNa reduction to 135 mEq/l vs the standard concentration (138 mEq/l) in pediatric and young adult patients on chronic HD. Material and methods: This single-center, prospective, randomized, crossover study consisted in a randomized sequence of two study phases: ""standard dNa"" of 138 mmol/L and ""low dNa"" of 135 mmol/L. Each study phase lasted 4 weeks and was preceded by a 2-week washout-period. Inclusion criteria were age <25 years, pre-HD serum Na (sNa)  130 mmol/L, hypertension, low incidence of intradialytic events. Study endpoints were: pre- and post-HD systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP), IDWG as percentage of body weight, first-hour refill index (a BVM-based index of preHD fluid overload), incidence of symptomatic sessions (hypotension, cramps, vomiting), pre- and postHD sNa. Results: Fifteen patients were recruited, mean age 17.8 ± 4.4 years (8 patients <18years). Pre- and post-HD SBP and DBP were not significantly different between the two treatments. Mean IDWG was significantly lower in the dNa 135 than in the dNa 138 phase: 2.12±1.39% vs 2.77±1.53% (p,0.008) with a mean reduction of 22.7%. The Refill Index was significantly lower with dNa of 135 mmol/L (p, 0.018). The mean sodium gradient (dNa-sNa) with dNa 138 and 135 mmol/L was 0.17±2.8 and 2.53±2.4 mmol/L respectively (p,""0.0001). The incidence of symptomatic sessions was similar (1.0% vs 1.0%). Conclusions: In a selected population of non-hypotension prone pediatric and young adult HD patients, lowering dNa to 135 mmol/L is associated with a significant reduction in IDWG over a 1-month period. Further longer-term studies are needed to investigate the effect of lowering dNa on BP in this population.""",1.0,flu,True

Results: Mean age of the cohort was 12.07±3.242 years. Rel-OH was higher in PD patients compared to HD (6.56±6.43 vs -2.57±6.67 %, p<0.005). Rel-OH did not differ between anuric patients and those with residual kidney function. Na intake was not associated with BP and PWA parameters, neither with rel-OH. We found no significant associations of rel-OH with MAP, central SBP, neither with pulse wave velocity (PWV), cardiac index (CI), and left ventricular mass index (LVMI). However, there was a negative association between heart rate-adjusted augmentation index (AIx75) and rel-OH levels (r,""-0.36, p<0.05). The differences in AIx75 between those with normal rel-OH (-7 to 7%) and rel-OH > 7% persisted after adjustment for age, sex, MAP, central SBP, PWV, and dialysis modality (29.15, 95%CI 26.9-31.3 vs 22.25, 95%CI 17.926.59 %, respectively, p<0.05). In HD patients we also found no association between interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) % and MAP, central SBP, AIx75, CI, PWV and LVMI. CI was numerically higher in those with IDWG > 4% but the difference was not significant. Conclusions: In children on dialysis volume overload may blunt the impact of reflecting waves in the pulse wave contour masking functional vascular abnormalities and resulting in lower AIx75 independent of BP and PWV levels.

The objectives of this study were to describe clinical data, genetic features and outcomes in a European population of VDDR1A, and to analyze genotype - phenotype correlations. Material and methods: We performed a multicentric retrospective study. Data from 24 genetically confirmed cases of VDDR1A from 10 centers were retrospectively reviewed. Data are presented as median [min - max]. Results: Clinical symptoms at diagnosis were mainly bone and neurological abnormalities. Age at diagnosis was 1.5 [0.5 - 8.7] years. Laboratory data at diagnosis showed mild hypocalcemia (1.97 [1.40 2.40] mmol/L) and hypophosphatemia (- 3.4 [- 13.4 - (-) 0.2] SDS), low 25OHD (23 [7 - 81] ng/mL) and low 1,25(OH)2D3 (14 [7 - 82] pg/ mL), secondary hyperparathyroidism with PTH at 6.6 [1.3 - 13.7] times ULN and increased alkaline phosphatases (2041 [521 - 7000] UI/L).

SchwGFR (point estimates, ml/min/1.73 m2) were calculated using the formula published by Schwartz et al (2009). Lab specific standard deviations (SD) of SCr assays (mean SD , 5 umol/l) and variability of height measurements (mean SD ,"" 0.5 cm) were used to calculate PE in SchwGFR (composite error/SD propagated from SCr and height measurements), which resulted in interval-based GFR (SchwGFRi) with individual 95% confidence intervals. The agreement/ disagreement between SchwGFRi and traditional point estimated GFR (SchwGFRp) was then analyzed (Cohen's kappa, test of proportions) to inform classification of CKD stages. Samples were classified as CKD if the lower limit of the SchwGFRi was below the CKD classification threshold of 90 ml/min/1.73 m2. Results: Mean SchwGFR PE (%) [89% prediction intervals] were: 1.49 [1.04-1.95], 1.83 [1.37-2.31], 2.17 [1.67-2.64] and 2.51 [2.01-2.95] at GFR levels of 30, 60, 90 and 120 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively. SchwGFRp identified CKD (GFR < 90) in 411/924 samples, whereas SchwGFRi detected CKD in an additional 49/924 (5.3%) samples (p<0.02), mostly CKD2. Conclusions: The propagation error of SchwGFR estimates was relatively small (up to 3%) but increased with increasing GFR and allowed for calculation of individual GFR """"trusted"""" intervals.

When conventional therapy of SHPT is ineffective calcimimetics may control symptoms but have been approved for children over 3 years of age. Scarce information is available for their use in the youngest age group. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of cincacalcet therapy in children below 3 years of age. Material and methods: Case records of 31 chidren dialysed under 3 yrs of age were screened for the use of calcimimetics. Clinical symptoms and iPTH, Ca and P levels and response to treatment were analysed. Clinical manifestation of SHPT were bone deformities in one case and growth retardation in two cases. Results: Three patients were identified all of whom had started peritoneal dialysis in infancy ( 1-8 months age). At a mean age of 27 months cinacalcet was introduced at an initial dose of 0.23mg/kg. Initial mean iPTH was 1968 pg/ml and calcium 11,7mg/dl. Therapy was continued over 9-36 months. The cinacalcet dose was titrated every 4 weeks based on iPTH and calcium threshold to a maximum dose 2,2mg/kg. The patients remained on stable doses of vitamin D analogues and phosphate binders. A spectacular 70% reduction of iPTH was observed while corrected calcium decreased insignificanty to 10,8mg/dl. Improvement of bone deformities was noted after 24 months of treatment. A single episode of mild asymptomatic hypocalcaemia occurred in the first month of treatment in one child and precoccius puberty in another. Conclusions: 1. Cinacalcet therapy was effective in children with SHPT below 3 years age. 2. With careful monitoring Cinacalcet was safe to use with insignificant decrease in calcium levels during treatment. 3.

Results: Insufficient disease-specific information and psychological support, as well as complicated access to specialized healthcare services were identified as relatively consistent problems throughout all stages of patient journey. Lengthy initial diagnosis process within primary healthcare and perceived poor quality of their services were highlighted during the diagnosis stage. Non-immediate access or procedural complexity to access certain therapies and financial burden on family were additional problems identified during the treatment and ongoing care stages. Inefficient and non-flexible reintegration to educational system and lack of disease-specific knowledge by staff were most important during rehabilitation stage.

The aim of the study was to search for informative non-invasive markers of renal parenchyma damage in children with chronic kidney disease. Material and methods: Proteomic study of urine was performed using proteomics methods (MALDI-TOF-MS/MS, Ultraflex II, Bruker, USA). Information about molecular interactions was obtained using the STRING 10.0 database. The study included 30 children aged 1 to 18 years with chronic kidney disease, the leading laboratory symptoms were microalbuminuria (MAU) and microhematuria. Results: The level of MAU in the examined children was: A0 (up to 10 mg / day) - in 17% (5 patients), A1 (from 10 to 30 mg / day) - in 13% (4 children), A2 (from 30 to 299 mg / day) - in 60% (18 children), A3 (from 300 mg / day and more) - in 10% (3 people). 45 different proteins have been isolated. In isolated erythrocyturia, tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen (100%), aquaporin-1 (75%), platelet growth factor  (65%), vasorin (50%), and antiepithelial membrane antigen (50%) were most frequently detected. With the addition of MAU, the frequency of detecting a molecule of damage to the kidney tissue (100%), an apoptosis-inducing factor (100%), aquaporin-1 (100%), and neutrophilic gelatinase-bound lipocalin (75%) increased. As the process progressed, in stage III chronic kidney disease, the proteomic spectrum of urine was determined by the factor stimulating prostacyclin, interleukin 16, matrix metalloproteinase, tolloid-like protein 2. Conclusions: Thus, the assessment of the proteomic spectrum of urine makes it possible to identify non-invasive markers of the progression of damage to the tubulointerstitial tissue of the kidneys associated with various pathologies accompanied by MAU and microhematuria.",1.0,disease,True

Material and methods: A prospective study of extremely preterm infants  31 weeks of gestational age with NC born in Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos between 2018 - 2022 was performed. The following data was collected at birth with a follow up at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months: weight, height, vitamin D, serum calcium, urine calcium/ creatinine ratio and renal ultrasound. Results: Out of 160 extremely preterm infants 45 (28%) had NC, 66.7% of them were boys. Mean age was 27.4 ± 2.2 weeks. Mean birth weight 1063.1 ± 326.0 g, and height 34.9 ± 4,3 cm. At age of 6 months calcium/ creatinine ratio was 1,28 [0.45-1.99] with NC vs. 0.45 [0.22-1.04] without NC. There was no correlation between vitamin D concentration and NC in all age groups. NC persisted in 69.8%, 62.5% and 46.2% after 6, 12, 24 months respectively. After 6 and 12 months NC was more frequent 6.4 [1.53-26.78] (p,""0,01) and 5.6 [1.146-27.37] (p"",""0,015) after more than 66 days of hospitalization in neonatal period respectively. A positive family history of kidney stones was 26.7%. Conclusions: Longer hospitalization and hypercalciuria, but not vitamin D and serum calcium concentration were risk factors for NC. Long term follow up of extremely premature infants with NC is recommended.""",1.0,positive,True

599,"Introduction: Trace elements are found in very low concentrations in biological fluids or tissues, which can sometimes cause deficiency and toxicity in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. In our study, we aimed to evaluate trace element levels in childhood CKD. Material and methods: Children who were diagnosed as CKD (n:64) with GFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and healthy children (n:25) were included in the study. Patients with CKD were divided into stage 3-4 CKD (n:27), haemodialysis (HD) (n:12) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) (n:25) groups. Zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) were measured in serum with a fully automatic biochemistry autoanalizer. Selenium (Se), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) method. Results: Serum Cu median value; In the control group, 178 g/dl (135.2270.3); In stage 3-4 CKD patients, 129.4 g/dl (108.6-139.1); In HD patients, 106.35 g/dl (96.25-130.5); In PD patients, 135.4 g/dl (122.5-144.4) was detected.

605,"Introduction: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with immune dysregulation, including impaired cellular immune function. T lymphocytes are actively involved in the cellular immune response by recognizing and presenting antigens and cause the target cell to be lysed with a cytotoxic effect. The T cell receptor (TCR) on the surface of T lymphocytes provides clonal expansion and response against the antigen. In this study, we evaluated the TCR V repertoire to investigate possible disturbances in the cellular response due to uremia. Material and methods: This single center cross-sectional study included 35 patients with CKD younger than 20 years (21 CKD stage 3-4 and 14 CKD stage 5-dialysis) and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The clinical data of the patients were obtained from their medical records. Lymphocyte subgroups and TCR V repertoire were assessed with a flow cytometry device simultaneously with complete blood count. Results: The median age of the patients 12.3 (8.6-19) years and the median lymphocyte count was 2300 (1800-2900)/l. There were no significant differences between patients and controls in terms of age, lymphocyte count, or lymphocyte subgroups (CD3, CD4, CD8 T cells, CD4/ CD8 ratio and CD16/56 NK). However, the expressions of TCR V 9, TCR V 11, and TCR V 16 were significantly lower and the expression of TCR V 17 was significantly higher in patients than in controls (p<0.05 for all). Subgroup analysis showed that there were significant differences in CD4 percentages, CD4/CD8 ratio, V11 and V12 between the CKD and dialysis groups (p<0.05 for all). Conclusions: Despite lymphocyte count and lymphocyte subsets comparable to those of healthy controls, children with CKD have an impaired TCR V repertoire. This deterioration is more pronounced in dialysis patients.",1.0,disease,True

610,"Introduction:Nephropathic cystinosis is a rare lysosomal storage disorder where accumulation of cystine, and formation of crystals, progressively damages various organs, including kidneys, retina, muscles and central nervous system. Cysteamine has been available since 1997 as immediate release (IR) formulation, Cystagon®, and since 2013 as extended release (ER) formulation, Procysbi®. The 10 Norwegian patients were all switched from IR- to ER-cysteamine in 2015-2016. The aim of this long-term, retrospective study was to evaluate implementation of ER-cysteamine in patients already treated with IR-cysteamine. Primary efficacy endpoints were white blood cell (WBC) cystine levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) change per year. Material and methods: All 10 Norwegian paediatric- and adult patients participated in the study and data were obtained retrospectively from up to 6 years prior to the switch, until time of inclusion. Results: Mean level of WBC cystine remained stable between the IRand ER treatment periods (1.19 versus 1.38 nmol hemicystine/mg protein) despite a dose reduction in most patients on ER-treatment. Mean eGFR change per year was more pronounced during ER-treatment compared to during IR-treament (-4.41 versus -0.17 ml/min/1.73m2/year). However, single events, such as tubulointerstitial nephritis and kidney transplantation, could have influenced the results. Z-height score developed positively from -1.062 before switch to -0.330 after switch. Four of seven patients with halitosis, reported improvement of symptoms after switch, one reported unchanged symptoms and two reported worsened symptoms. Most adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were of mild to moderate severity during both periods. However, one patient developed two serious ADRs during ER-treatment and was eventually switched back to IR-formulation. Conclusions: The results from this long-term retrospective study indicates that a switch from IR- to ER-cysteamine was feasible and safe under routine clinical practice. However, due to the low number of patients, and the retrospective collection of data, it is hard to draw any definitive conclusions.",1.0,flu,True

Hypertension can initially be medically managed however, endovascular interventions or vascular surgery may be necessary in patients who do not achieve good blood pressure(BP) control on medication only. To our knowledge, this is the first study looking into quality of life(QoL) and clinical outcomes in children who underwent renovascular surgery. Material and methods: Retrospective study on all 22 patients who underwent a renal auto-transplant and/or a renovascular surgery between 2000 and 2021 at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust. Data collection was obtained through electronic patient records. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used. The median and interquartile ranges were reported when data was not normally distributed. Quality of life was assessed using the validated PedsQLTM Transplant Module questionnaires. Results: A minority of children (12.3%) with renovascular hypertension required vascular surgery following which, there was a significant improvement in BP control in those who had an auto transplant and an aortic bypass as well as needing to use fewer anti-hypertensive drugs and reduction in number of angioplasties required post-surgery. Patient survival was 100% and kidney function was preserved in all patients. QoL improved with patients needing to take fewer medications and having fewer concerns regarding medicine side effects and body image. Median score was 70 (100 being highest). Patients reported better QoL than their parents.

Results: A total of 9 patients, 4 children and 5 adults, 10.1-34.4 years old, were included. All 5 adult patients and one adolescent had received a kidney transplant (3 in one patient). Despite individual variations, no significant differences in grouped WBC (white blood cells) cystine levels were observed after the switch. In patients with preserved kidney function, eGFR remained stable after the switch. There was no significant difference in the cysteamine dose received before and after the switch. However, we observed that some patients were receiving <50% of recommended doses of cysteamine and showed elevated levels of WBC cystine. A significant improvement in height, weight and corresponding Z scores after the switch was observed, particularly in paediatric patients (p<0.05). There was a trend towards reduction in the number of hospitalizations and a significant reduction in the hospitalizations stays (days of hospitalization; p<0,0001) after the switch to ER-cysteamine, especially in those patients who were admitted due to medication or to the disease itself. A reduction in the appearance of halitosis, body odour and gastrointestinal effects, as well as PPI use were observed after the change to ERcysteamine in some of the patients.

Material and methods: We present a case of a child with severe hepatic dysfunction, cardiac involvement and a rare renal presentation including CAKUT and proximal Fanconi tubulopathy. Results: Male infant born full-term from healthy non-consanguineous parents. Prenatal ultrasound showed severe left hydronephrosis with thickened parenchyma and cysts. Postnatal evaluation confirmed functional annulment of left kidney, with normal right kidney. Cystography showed mild left vesicoureteral reflux. After birth he developed severe and progressive cholestasis with hypoacolia. Etiological study of cholestasis, including exploratory laparoscopy, hepatic biopsy and genetic study, was negative. After finding of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, a tubular function study revealed signs of proximal tubulopathy (hyperuricosuria, glycosuria, mild renal phosphate loss, low molecular weight proteinuria, generalized aminoaciduria). Sodium bicarbonate was initiated at 3 months, and common causes of tubulopathy with hepatopathy were ruled out. Liver disease progressed to cirrhosis and was complicated by an arterioportal shunt leading to congestive heart failure and requiring embolization. Finally, at 10 months of age he received a liver transplant, without complications and good further liver function. After liver transplantation, he had hypertension and progressive declining in glomerular filtration rate. He currently has stage 3 CKD with an estimated GFR of 33 mL/ min/1.73m2.

Data on efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in children with DD are sparse. The aim of the study was to investigate the efficacy of ACE inhibitors in boys with DD. Material and methods: We conducted retrospective longitudinal study of 15 boys aged 12.0 (IQR: 9.0; 15.5) years at the last follow up including 12 patients with DD1 and 3 with DD2 types confirmed by direct Sanger sequencing. The median proteinuria before treatment with ACE inhibitors was 0.92 (0.67; 1.42) g/m2/day. The median eGFR before ACE inhibitors was 82.1 (70.2; 89.5) ml/min/1.73m2. The median age of starting ACE inhibitors was 7.5 (6.0; 9.5) years. The initial ACE inhibitors dosage was 0.13 (0.11; 0.2) mg/kg/day. The median time of treatment with ACE inhibitors was 35.0 (23.0; 85.0) months. Results: Treatment with ACE inhibitors led to reduction (>50%) in proteinuria in 9/15 (60%) children with DD including all 3 boys with DD2 type. 2/15 (13.3%) and 4/15 (26.7%) boys with DD treated with ACE inhibitors had the same or increased proteinuria, respectively. Increased eGFR at the last follow-up was found in 8/15 (53.3%) children with DD including all 3 boys with DD2 type. The median rate of increasing eGFR from baseline level on the treatment with ACE inhibitors was 11% (3.4%; 26.4%). 7/15 (46.7%) boys with DD had declined eGFR at the last follow up by 10.6% (-30.1%; -6.2%).

652,"Introduction: The NEFIGAN and the NefIgArd trials demonstrated that the oral, targeted-release-formulation (TRF) of the glucocorticoid budesonide, delivering the drug to the distal ileum, suppressed the dysfunctional mucosal immune system and, in conjunction with optimal renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade (RAASB), safely reduced proteinuria and improved renal function in IgA-Nephropathy (IgAN) in adults. Also, the safety profile of TRF-budesonide is proposed to be superior to systemic glucocorticoid therapy given its extensive first pass metabolism with <10% entering the systemic circulation. To our knowledge, only one case report detailing the first successful trial of this therapy in a paediatric patient was published. Here, we want to share our experience with TRF-budesonide therapy. Material and methods: A 13-year-old boy who underwent a routine laboratory blood examination for a scheduled jaw cysts extraction was unexpectedly diagnosed with IgAN. At the time of the diagnosis his serum creatinine was 2.4 mg/dl, and urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (uPCR) was >700 g/mol. He had hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH); the family history was positive for celiac disease of the father. A kidney biopsy demonstrated features of IgA mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis with focal segmental sclerosis and crescents (14%). Celiac disease was excluded. He received pulse methylprednisolone therapy on 3 consecutive days, followed by oral prednisone over 2 months (for 1 month 75 mg daily, then 50 mg every other day) as well as maximally tolerated RAASB. Because of persisting proteinuria in the nephrotic range therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was initiated. After 3 months only small reductions of proteinuria and serum creatinine were achieved. A second course of systemic glucocorticoids was not considered, because he had suffered from the steroidassociated side effect of depressive mood during the first course of steroids. We therefore initiated treatment with 15 mg TRF-budesonide daily continuing MMF and RAASB. Results: The blood pressure normalised reaching values <50thpercentile, the LVH decreased. 3 and 6 months after initiation of TRF-budesonide the patient responded well with a 86% decrease of uPCR down to 100 g/mol and a 34% decrease of serum creatinine down to 1.6 mg/dL. Budesonide was well tolerated, and no side effects were observed. Conclusions: This case report of successful and well tolerated treatment of IgAN with TRF-budesonide in a paediatric patient underlines the potential of this drug for this disease, for which no approved therapy is currently available. Controlled trails on TRF-budesonide in children with IgAN are required.",1.0,trial,True

656,"Introduction: IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common glomerulonephritis in childhood. Long-term outcome is generally good, but the risk of progression is about 20-30% at 20 years from onset. Disease course is variable and difficult to predict, ranging from spontaneous remission to rapid progression. Most pediatric studies have focused on identifying risk factors of progression. Conversely, few data exist on IgAN remission. Our study aimed to identify the probability of a complete clinical remission of pediatric IgAN and its predictive factors. Material and methods: In our monocentric retrospective study, we selected all IgAN histological confirmed cases from 1986 to 2018. The",1.0,Disease,True

Complete clinical remission was defined as absence of proteinuria, hematuria, hypertension, renal failure, in patients off therapy for more than 1 year. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model were used for the analysis. Results: A total of 153 patients were enrolled, with an age at onset of 10.6 ±4 years. At biopsy, prevalence of proliferative lesions (M 41%, E 18%, C 19%) was higher compared to chronic ones (S 32%, T 4%). The estimated probability of complete remission was about 40% at 10 years of follow-up. The probability of recurrence at 6 years from remission was about 20%. Uni-multivariate analyses showed that age at onset and presence of S1 lesions at biopsy were significantly associated with lower chances of complete remission (HR 0.899; p0.041, and HR 0.160; p0.013, respectively). No specific treatment predicted outcome. Conclusions: Our study has documented that pediatric IgAN has a significant probability of complete remission at 10 years from onset, and a limited probability of recurrence within 6 years from remission. The greatest chances of complete remission were observed in younger children and in the absence of glomerulosclerosis on biopsy.",1.0,clinical,True

664,"Introduction: IgA Vasculitis Nephritis (IgAVN) is in a large majority of cases self-limiting but a small proportion of affected children develop marked proteinuria, worsening kidney function and even kidney failure. The aim of our study was to define the clinical parameters at onset that have an effect on outcome in a large cohort of children with kidney biopsy-proven IgAVN. Material and methods: Data were collected through a retrospective international survey from December 2020 to August 2021. Anonymised demographic and clinical data (including renal outcome data) were collected for children (0-18 years of age) with typical symptoms of IgA-Vasculitis, biopsy-proven IgAVN and a follow up of at least 12 months. Results: Data from 1175 patients were collected from 42 international paediatric nephrology centres. Median age at kidney biopsy was 8.3 years, 43 % female, median duration of follow up 3.7 years. At time of biopsy 37 patients (3.5 %) had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 ml/min/1.73m2 and 2.6 % needed kidney replacement therapy. 92.5% of the patients had proteinuria, 50% within nephrotic range. With increasing age children had lower eGFR but also lower proteinuria at presentation (p,0.000 and p,""0.008). 54.1 % had normalised their kidney function, 40.4 % had CKD Stage 1 and 2, 5.5 % CKD 3-5 at last follow up. 76.6 % had normalised urinary protein excretion, 1.5% continued to have nephrotic range proteinuria. Lower eGFR (p"",""0.000), hypoalbuminemia (p"",0.027) and nephrotic syndrome (p,0.002) at onset were predictors of impaired eGFR at last follow up. Conclusions: This cohort is the largest study to date of children with biopsy proven IgAVN and confirms the overall favourable outcome in the medium term. Nephrotic syndrome and impaired kidney function at onset increased the risk of developing CKD in the medium term.",1.0,case,True

However, data are lacking regarding the severity of histopathologic findings in cIgAN with minimal to absent proteinuria since kidney biopsy indications are not well defined in such cases. Material and methods: Data on 140 consecutive cIgAN patients with a kidney biopsy from 4 different centers in Paris (France) and Montreal (Canada) were reviewed in order to select patients with urine protein/ creatinine ratio (UP/Cr) < 0.03 g/mmol and normal renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 90ml/min/1.73m2) at biopsy and before any treatment. Results: A total of 28 cIgAN (mean age 11.02 years ± 3.740); median follow-up 3 years [0.84-11.55] were included. History of macroscopic hematuria was present in 92.8%. At first evaluation, mean eGFR was 115.5 ± 18.2 ml/min/1,73m2, median UP/Cr was 0.02 [0.011-0.03] g/mmol. Microscopic or macroscopic hematuria was present in 35.7 and 64% respectively. Kidney biopsy optic microscopy showed: mesangial (M1), endocapillary (E1) or extracapillary (C1) proliferation in 53.5, 32.1 and 7% of patients, respectively. Chronic lesions were also present: glomerulosclerosis (S1) and tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis in 42% and 7%. Podocytopathic features were also present in 21%. ACE inhibitors or an immunosuppressive therapy were prescribed in respectively 42.8% and 21.5 % of cases and no treatment in 35.7%. At last follow-up, median eGFR was 102 [91.63-124.4] ml/mn/1.73m2 and median UP/Cr was 0.028 [0.01-0.03] g/mmol. eGFR was < 90 in 6 patients (21.4%) and 2 (7%) had increased proteinuria (UP/Cr >0.03 g/mmol).

Also rituximab was used for the patient with SLE. There were no positivity in the plasma and urine samples of the healthy control group. Conclusions: The use of steroids alone as immunosuppressive therapy does not appear to be an important risk factor for BKV reactivation. It does not seem necessary to perform BKV-DNA screening in pediatric patients receiving mild immunosuppressive therapy. It has been thought that BKV reactivation may be more frequent, especially if the underlying disease is SLE or if intense immunosuppression is used, and BKV screening may be performed in these patients. Our results suggest that frequency of BK viruria and viremia are very low in healthy children.",1.0,disease,True

679,"Introduction: Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) has been recently recognized as one of the infrequent kidney involvement phenotypes among adult patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients. Although SARS-CoV-2 associated intrinsic kidney disease has been still scarcely reported in children, at the time of this case report only one case of AIN has been published. Material and methods: Case report of a 12 year old boy with AIN. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibody (abcam: ab272504) and electron microscopy (EM) was performed. Results: The patient presented with fatigue, anorexia and polydipsia following a real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 6 weeks ago. Initial work-up revealed estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 23 ml/min/1.73 m2, high erythrocyte-sedimentation rate (120 mm/h), anemia (hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL), thrombocytosis (517 x 109) and increased C-reactive protein (49.6 mg/L). Urine tests showed glucosuria, low-molecular weight proteinuria and microhematuria with hyaline and granular casts on microscopy. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S protein receptor binding domain confirmed prior infection with high titres (453 BAU/ml). Kidney biopsy showed diffuse active interstitial nephritis with negative immunofluorescence and positive IHC for SARS-CoV-2 in interstitial inflammatory infiltrate and EM revealed SARS-CoV-2-like viral particles. Kidney function continued to deteriorate despite several days of watch and wait period (eGFR nadir 19.8 ml/min/1.73 m2) and thus treatment with methylprednisolone pulse-dose therapy (1000 mg thrice) was initiated. This was followed by oral methylprednisolone 48 mg once daily which led to complete normalization of kidney function within 3 weeks. Conclusions: Our case adds to the emerging evidence of SARS-CoV-2 as a potential etiological agent of AIN in children. In the light of evolving virus spread among children and potential asymptomatic course, epidemiological history, serologic testing and SARS-CoV-2 detection in biopsy should be added to the work-up of children with AIN of unknown etiology.",1.0,respiratory,True

684,"Introduction: aHUS is a life-threatening disease of complement dysregulation, characterised by thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). While treatment with C5 inhibition is effective, currently approved therapies require regular intravenous infusions. Crovalimab, a novel anti-C5 monoclonal antibody, allows for small-volume, subcutaneous self-injections. Crovalimab is being tested for treatment of aHUS in two global, Phase III single-arm trials: COMMUTE-a and COMMUTE-p. Material and methods: COMMUTE-a (NCT04861259) will enrol 3 cohorts of patients with aHUS aged  12 years and weighing  40 kg (N  90): 1) Naive (n  60): complement inhibitor-naive patients; 2) Switch (n  30): patients switching from eculizumab/ ravulizumab; and 3) C5 SNP (n < 5): patients with a known singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP). COMMUTE-p (NCT04958265) will enrol 3 cohorts of patients with aHUS aged  28 days to < 18 years and weighing  5 kg (N  35): 1) Naive (n  20): complement inhibitor-naive patients; 2) Switch (n  10): patients switching from eculizumab/ravulizumab; and 3) Pretreated (n < 10): patients who received and discontinued prior eculizumab/ravulizumab treatment. In both COMMUTE-a and COMMUTE-p trials, patients will receive weight-based crovalimab as a weekly loading series (Weeks 1-4; intravenous dose on Day 1, followed by subcutaneous dosing for subsequent loading doses), followed by self-administered, subcutaneous maintenance doses once every 4 weeks (or once every 2 weeks if < 20 kg; Week 5 onward). The primary objective for both studies is to evaluate the efficacy of crovalimab in Naive patients, based on the proportion of patients with complete TMA response any time from baseline to Week 25. Results: COMMUTE-a and COMMUTE-p are currently enrolling. Conclusions: Both COMMUTE-a and COMMUTE-p will assess the efficacy and safety of crovalimab in patients with aHUS.",1.0,disease,True

The aim of this study is to determine the factors affecting the clinical course of pediatric C3G patients with and without mutations in genes regulating alternative complement pathway. Methods: Sixty pediatric patients with C3G from 18 referral centers in Turkey were included in study. Patients were classified according to whether they had any complement genetic mutations or not. Demographic data, clinic-pathologic findings, treatment, and outcome data were compared and survey analysis of groups with and without mutations was performed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: We found mutation in complement system regulating genes in 17 of 60 patients. The most common mutation was in the CFH gene (53.3%). Mean age at diagnosis was 11.2±4.1 years and 56% (n:28) of all patients were male. The age at diagnosis was statistically significantly higher in the group with mutation (12.9±3.6). Median follow-up time was 45 months. The follow-up time of the group with mutation was significantly longer (59/35). While the patients without mutation were most frequently presented with the nephrotic syndrome(%39.5(n:17)), the group with mutations presented with asymptomatic urinary findings(%47.1(n:8)), and the difference was significant(p:0.043). No significant difference was found in terms of serum BUN, creatinine, C3, C4 and urine protein to creatinine at the time of admission. While low albumin(<3gr/dl) was detected in 69.8%(n:30) of patients without mutation, this rate was 29.4%(n:5) in the group with mutations and it was statistically significant(p:0.008). When the histopathological features were compared, no difference was found. During the follow-up, 10 of all patients developed CKD, 4 of which were from the mutation group. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the mean time to develop CKD was 110.4±9.7 months in the group without mutation, while it was 139.1±30.5 months in the group with mutation. The difference was not found statistically significant. In survival analysis in patients in all the groups and with mutation group, MMF treatment did not change the CKD process.

804,"Introduction: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis and unclassified colitis, are multisystem diseases. Renal manifestations are not uncommon, and heterogeneous, inaugural or not, caused by IBD itself, their complications, or their treatments. Despite the frequency of IBD in children, there are few data on IBDrelated renal damage in this population. The aim of this study is to describe these renal disorders in a series of pediatric IBD cases, in order to highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties. Material and methods: This study is a retrospective observational study of a series of pediatric cases collected after a call for observations to pediatric nephrologists of the Society of Pediatric Nephrology and the French Group of Pediatric Gastro-Enterology and Hepatology. Results: We present the preliminary results of the ongoing study of 6 patients in 5 hospitals in France. 5/6 patients had Crohns disease. 4/6 were treated with PENTASA(1 associateed with Infliximab), 1 with Vedolizumab, and 1 was not treated. Renal involvement manifested as acute kidney injury in all patients and occurred at the same time as digestive manifestations in two cases. Proteinuria and hematuria were not always present. When performed (3 cases), renal biopsy revealed serious tubulointerstitial nephritis. The renal lesions were treated with corticosteroids or simply monitored. 3 cases were attributed to a iatrogenic cause, and IBD treatment was suspended (PENTASA 2/6, VEDOLIZUMAB 1/6). During follow-up, renal function normalized in 2/6 patients, and 4/6 kept chronic kidney disease of varying severity. Conclusions: The etiological diagnosis of IBD-related kidney damage remains very difficult and often unclear in clinical practice, which makes therapeutic decisions difficult and may delay diagnosis and management, increasing the risk of renal sequels.",1.0,disease,True

810,"Introduction: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is an often under-recognised problem in the paediatric population. It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality along with an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease. Paediatric patients at high risk of AKI have been identified within the following clinical areas: Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), Haematology/Oncology and Cardiology. An AKI E-Alert system was subsequently piloted across the three aforementioned three areas to identify incidence of AKI in a tertiary paediatric hospital. Material and methods: All patients of the three clinical areas between 1st August and 31st October 2020 with an AKI stage 1 alert were included. The serum creatinine level (SCr) at the time of the alert was manually evaluated to assess true incidence of AKI using KDIGO classification. Baseline SCr was identified as the lowest SCr result on the Electronic Care Record system in the preceding 12 months or when this was unavailable, using the upper limit of the reference range for age. Results: Over a 3 month period there were 159 AKI stage 1 alerts affecting a total of 86 patients. Based on KDIGO classification, we identified 39 patients with AKI stage 1 (45%), 36 patients with AKI stage 2 (42%) and 7 patients with AKI stage 3 (8%). 4 patients were excluded as they were incorrectly highlighted as having had an AKI (5%). Haematology/ Oncology patients most frequently developed true AKIs (51% ) and had the highest number of AKI stage 2-3s. Conclusions: The implementation of this pilot AKI E-Alert system provides crucial information regarding the incidence of inpatient AKI in high risk paediatric patient groups. This will ultimately allow for early recognition and timely treatment of AKI, thus reducing the long term burden on paediatric renal health. This pilot also highlights the need for funding of an AKI service throughout the hospital.",1.0,disease,True

All patients received prior and/or adjuvant therapies including nephrotoxic drugs (cyclosporine, cisplatin or cyclophosphamide) or radiotherapy (50%) Results: The indication for BVZ in the majority was tumor progression (n,""48; 80%),with complete/partial remission in 17%.The mean treatnebt duration was 13.66 months (1-62),18.3 months in nephrotoxicity patients (2.8-34.2).Survival after BVZ was>90 months in 9% of cases,most frequent being 12-36 months (22.5%).Proteinuria and hypertension was observed in 15.10%. When comparing the cumulative dose and duration of treatment with the finding of proteinuria and hypertension,a correlation was observed(100%/50% if >30g and 6.3% /3.2% if >2 years).Long-term analysis of renal function was not possible in the entire cohort due to high mortality (57%),with only 28 patients in long-term follow-up among them,if we exclude the patients who received a nephrotoxic agent after BVZ,only two patients who received BVZ without previous nephrotoxicity (7.14%) presented a glomerular filtration deficit (83 and 88ml/min/ 1.73 m2). Conclusions: Long-term renal evaluation in these patients is highly hampered by poor survival,probable previous nephrotoxic damage,and the difficulty of reliably determining renal function in historical cohorts.All patients with proteinuria and hypertension due to BVZ normalized these parameters after its withdrawal.The alterations observed in long-term renal function are minimal and do not allow conclusions to be drawn.Knowledge of the mechanisms of nephrotoxicity,as well as its long-term effects,is essential for the development of new guidelines and preventive strategies that minimize the risk and impact on survival of these patients.""",1.0,case,True

820,"Introduction: Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is standard of care for infants with moderate-severe hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) in most high-income countries as it reduces the risk of death or severe neurologic disability. Perinatal asphyxia is a common cause of neonatal acute kidney injury (AKI), which remains a frequent complication also in infants treated with TH. Studies on long term renal outcome after TH are scarce. We recently reported that 21% of survivors in our cohort of children with TH-treated HIE had decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) according to the Schwartz-Lyon equation at age 10-12 years. We now sought to investigate renal functions in greater detail in our cohort. Material and methods: Our cohort consisted of children born in Stockholm 2007-2009 with a history of TH-treated HIE. At age 10-12, we calculated cystatin C-estimated GFR (cyst C eGFR). Children with decreased cyst C eGFR were examined with iohexol clearance as well. Furthermore, we measured urine-albumin/creatinine ratio in a morning sample, blood pressure (BP) and renal volume on magnetic resonance tomography. Results: Forty-eight children participated in the assessment. Five per cent (2/42) had decreased cyst C eGFR, and one child (2% 1/42) had decreased GFR according to iohexol clearance. Microalbuminuria was seen in one child (2%, 1/43), and an elevated office BP in three children (7%, 3/45). Subsequent ambulatory 24-hour BP-measurement revealed high normal BP in one case only (2%, 1/45). No child had hypertension. Mean renal volume was 232.2 cc (SD 40.01, 95% CI 217.7-246.6 cc). There was no difference in any of the parameters between children who had suffered neonatal AKI and those who had not. Conclusions: In our cohort, the Schwartz-Lyon equation appears to overestimate the incidence of decreased GFR. Cyst C eGFR and iohexol clearance confirmed a decreased GFR in only 5% and 2% of children, respectively. Albuminuria and elevated BP were rare.",1.0,case,True

Material and methods: The first 3-month follow-up of 117 patients with HSCT between January 2019-December 2021 was retrospectively evaluated. Renal complications were evaluated as acute kidney injury (AKI) and non-AKI problems (hypertension, proteinuria, increased echogenicity or kidney enlargement on ultrasonography, electrolyte imbalance). Pediatric RIFLE criteria were used for the diagnosis of AKI. The patients were analyzed according to age, gender, donor type, primary diagnosis and complications of HSCT. Results: Renal complications (60% male) were detected in 83 patients (AKI in 36 patients, Non-AKI in 47 patients).

Results: This study includes 128 preterm infants (68 ELBW and 60 VLBW) with a median birthweight of 962 (range 210-1490) g. Of the entire cohort, 25 patients (20%) suffered from at least one episode of neonatal AKI, in eight patients (6% of the whole cohort) AKI was classified as severe (stage 2 or 3). The incidence of AKI differed significantly between ELBW and VLBW infants (28 versus 10%, p,""0.011). Both, length of intensive care as well as length of hospitalisation, was significantly longer in the infants with AKI as compared to those without AKI. Infants with AKI had significantly lower Apgar Scores at 10 minutes compared to infants without AKI. Mechanical ventilation and therapy with resuscitation drugs was performed more frequently in the cohort with AKI (68% vs. 21%; p<0.001; 40% vs. 11%; p< 0.001). In addition, more infants with AKI received indomethacin due to persisting ductus arteriosus Botalli. Conclusions: As already shown in other studies, neonatal AKI occurred more frequently in ELBW as compared to VLBW infants. Infants with AKI had a lower gestational age and birth weight, lower APGAR values and needed a less intensive therapy including nephrotoxic medication. Interestingly, the overall incidence of AKI was substantially lower in our cohort as compared to recent studies which might be related to the very restrictive use of intubation and mechanical ventilation in our center.""",0.0,,False

930,"Introduction: The prognosis of neurological outcome in hyperammonemia caused by inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) depends on plasma ammonia levels and duration of hyperammonaemic coma. Current guidelines suggest the use of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in the treatment of refractory hyperammonemia. Due to limited vascular access available in a newborn, conventional peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been studied but showed limited efficacy in reducing ammonia levels. This study aims to evaluate if continuous flow peritoneal dialysis (CFPD) is an effective treatment in the management of hyperammonemia due to IEM in newborns. Material and methods: Three neonates were managed with CFPD in addition to standard medical therapy. CFPD was performed with two bedside-placed catheters sized 10F for inflow and 12F for outflow. The peritoneum was initially filled with 20ml/kg of dialysate during catheter insertion followed by continuous dialysate inflow with the use of an infusion pump at initial rate of 10ml/kg/hour then titrated up as tolerated. The dialysate outflow was gravity dependent with the drainage bag placed 80cm below the outflow catheter. Dialysate was bicarbonate buffered with 2% dextrose concentration. Infusion of dialysate was stopped every 4th hour to allow passive drainage. Results: The mean age of the patients were 9.3 ± 6.7 days old. The mean plasma ammonia level before dialysis was 1256 ± 466 mol/L. The mean inflow rate of dialysate was 54 ± 19.9 ml/kg/hour. The mean outflow rate was 51.5 ± 22.9 ml/kg/hour.

Inhibitory potency of BBP711 was measured in cultured confluent HepaRG cells over a 7-day period while 5 mM of glycolate was used to enhance oxalate production. Given the structural similarity of the substrate binding sites of GO and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), BBP-711 activity was evaluated with purified LDHA to exclude off-target effects. Results: GO expression in HepaRG cells was confirmed by western blot analysis. Colocalization of GO and the peroxisome marker catalase was confirmed by immunohistochemistry of the cells. BBP-711 demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of oxalate production by HepaRG cells over the duration of the experiment (mean IC50 value ± SD of 414 ± 200 nM, 521 ± 47, 481 ± 69 nM at 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours, respectively). In vitro assays demonstrated that relative to its inhibitory potency against GO (IC50,"" 15.4 nM), BBP-711 demonstrated only marginal inhibition (>10%) of LDHA at a much higher concentration (10 M). Conclusions: This novel cellular assay demonstrates the localization of GO in the peroxisome and the ability of BBP-711 to inhibit peroxisomal GO-mediated oxalate production at therapeutic target concentrations.""",1.0,flu,True

The relationship between the metabolic data and the stone type was then analyzed, taking into account two types of minerals: stones with a predominance of calcium oxalate dihydrate (weddellite) and calcium oxalate monohydrate (whewellite). Results: The ROC analyzes showed that lower values of each of 4 variables: phosphate and oxalate excretion, magnesium-creatinine ratio, urine pH are characteristic for patients with stones containing > 60% of weddellite. The most useful in identifying these stones were the product of the excreted phosphate and oxalate, and then the excreted phosphate and oxalate, and the urine pH. In the regression analysis finding a reduced value of each of these 4 variables increased more than sixfold the chance of diagnosing urolithiasis with stone composed of over 60% of weddellite (p,""0,019). Conclusions: The reduced excretion of phosphates and oxalates in the 24-hour urine sample and the reduced magnesium-creatinine ratio, as well as the reduced urine pH in patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria, more than six times increases the probability of diagnosis of calcium oxalate stones with a predominance of > 60% of weddellite.""",0.0,,False

946,"Introduction: Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is characterised by hepatic overproduction of oxalate, leading to hyperoxaluria which can result in nephrocalcinosis, urolithiasis and renal failure. Conservative management of PH1 aims to reduce the urinary oxalate concentration (high fluid intake, citrate, pyridoxine). The only curative treatment to date is a liver transplant. Lumasiran is a novel drug that has been approved for use in PH1 patients in November 2020. It reduces the oxalate synthesis in the liver by RNA interference. Data on its effect in routine clinical setting are scarce. Material and methods: We present data on 6 patients (3 girls) with genetically confirmed PH1, including 2 on dialysis. Results: Median age at start of treatment was 10.8 (1.8-15.8) years. In those with preserved renal function median reduction of hyperoxaluria was 66% (range 50.4-82%) after 2 months and 58% (4.4-71%) after 6 months. One of these patients had rapid normalization initially but urinary oxalate levels started rising again after the third dose and reached values similar to before the treatment was started. In 2 patients urinary oxalate decreased to healthy control values. In the 2 patients on dialysis, frequency of sessions could be decreased in one patient because plasma oxalate levels decreased but had to be increased in the other due to increasing systemic oxalosis. Treatment was well tolerated, the only noticeable side effects were injection site reactions. Conclusions: Even though there is promising data regarding the benefits of Lumasiran in PH1, this could not be replicated in all of our patients. Our data highlights the need to regularly re-evaluate hyperoxaluria during Lumasiran treatment also in the long-term; registry data seem mandatory for all PH1 patients treated with Lumasiran to monitor effectiveness and side effects.",1.0,flu,True

The aim of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to analyze clinical and genetic data regarding a possible genotype-phenotype correlation in individuals with disease-causing variants in COL4A3/COL4A4. Material and methods: 89 individuals carrying at least one COL4A3/ COL4A4 variant classified as (likely) pathogenic according to the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines and current amendments were recruited. Clinical data concerning the prevalence and age of first manifestation of MH, proteinuria, ESKD, eye anomalies and hearing impairment were raised.

This syndrome has only been reported in three patients previously. Hepatic involvement precedes renal involvement and is characterized by early onset hepatosplenomegaly, ductal plate malformation, hepatic fibrosis and cholestasis. Renal findings which may not be present at diagnosis include increased echogenicity, severe interstitial fibrosis, tubular dilatation with prominent epithelial luminal budding. We describe here two Turkish siblings with NPHP19 having previously undefined cardiac involvement. Material and methods: Case Report Results: Two siblings presented due to chronic renal disease (CKD) and proteinuria at the ages of 7.5 (female) and 10 (male) years. Their parents were first degree relatives. Both had a history of liver transplantation at the ages of 2.5 and 1.5 years, respectively. They had neonatal cholestasis and liver pathology was characterized by biliary cirrhosis and hepatic fibrosis. Both had small echogenic kidneys and nephrotic range proteinuria. CKD stage was 3 and 2 in the girl and the boy, respectively. Kidney biopsy in the boy disclosed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Valvular aortic stenosis was detected in both siblings. End stage renal disease developed in the girl at 9 years of age and she died at 10-year of age due to sudden cardiac arrest. The boy is 13-year-old at present and still had stage 2 CKD and nephrotic range proteinuria. Genetic analysis for nephronophitisis panel revealed a novel likely pathogenic homozygous frameshift mutation in exon 7 of DCDC2 gene (chr6:24278358, c.840dup, p.Glu281ArgfdTer27) in both siblings. Conclusions: Renal involvement has been reported in two of three NPHP19 patients in the literature.

Thus, both SARS-CoV-2 infection and lockdown measures may have influenced INS incidence. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence of childhood INS during the COVID19 pandemic and compare it to the pre-COVID period. Material and methods: A written questionnaire was sent to the 37 pediatric departments in Paris area.

In developing kidneys, renin progenitor cells appear in the kidney arterial tree and juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA), while kallikrein expression characterizes distal nephron. Both renin and kallikrein seem to influence kidney development and maturation. Data on kallikrein expression are conflicting, especially during human kidney development. In this study, we analyze the spatiotemporal and functional relationship between kidney renin and kallikrein during human development, in the postnatal period, and in the nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type (CNF). Material and methods: The spatiotemporal expression of renin and kallikrein was analyzed in human kidneys by double immunofluorescence techniques in paraffin sections of 10 human conceptuses 8 to 38 weeks old, in 1,5-year-old healthy kidney tissues and in the CNF. Results: In the embryonic period, renin - kallikrein expression characterized metanephric cup cells, S-form nephrons, immature glomeruli, and collecting ducts (CD). In fetal and postnatal kidneys, kallikrein was partly expressed in distal tubules (DT) and CD, and strongly along connecting tubules (CT), while renin expression characterized DT and CD, and partly CT. Their co-expression was observed in small areas of DT and CT. In CNF kidneys, renin and kallikrein co-expression was stronger and with longer overlapping areas than in the healthy kidneys. Conclusions: Our data suggested the interaction of renin and kallikrein during kidney maturation and in the blood pressure control.

984,"Introduction: During early human kidney development, metanephric mesenchyme cells undergo mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). In the S-shape nephron, cells of the proximal nephron differentiate into podocytes and parietal epithelial cells (PECs). Near the vascular glomerular pole, PECs share podocyte markers and ultrastructure. While podocytes are unique terminally differentiated cells, PECs form a simple squamous epithelium. Pathologically changed kidneys are characterized by the proliferation and detachment of podocytes and PECs, and the appearance of cellular bridges between them. We analyzed the expression of Notch2, WNT4 and Snail in developing and postnatal human kidneys, in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type (CNF). Material and methods: Expression of Notch2, WNT4 and Snail was analyzed in sections of 10 human conceptuses 8 to 38 weeks old, in 3 healthy postnatal kidneys and in 7 CNF and FSGS samples, using immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy (EM). Results: In developing kidneys, WNT4 expression increased moderately in podocytes and strongly in PECs, while in CNF and FSGS kidneys decreased in both cell populations. Notch2 was widely expressed in the developing kidneys, moderately in podocytes and strongly in PECs. In CNF, expression of Notch2 increased, while it decreased in FSGS. Snail was expressed moderately in early nephrogenesis, while in later development Snail increased only in PECs. In CNF and FSGS kidneys Snail increased both in the podocytes and PECs. EM showed cytoplasmic processes between podocytes and PECs in developing and healthy kidneys, in CNF and FSGS. Conclusions: Developmental expression of WNT4, Notch2 and Snail indicate their role in MET and nephrogenesis of human kidneys, while changed expression pattern characterizes kidneys affected by CNF and FSGS.

997,"Introduction: Calcineurin inhibitors, including tacrolimus, are considered 2nd or 3rd line treatment for the management of complex nephrotic syndrome. Current practice in our centre is to perform a routine renal biopsy for assessment of nephrotoxicity after 2 years; defined as excessive glomerulosclerosis with or without arteriolar hyalinosis. Significant nephrotoxicity would necessitate the need to consider a switch to nonnephrotoxic immunosuppression. The aim of this audit was to review the management of patients with nephrotic syndrome following evidence of tacrolimus toxicity on renal biopsy. Material and methods: This was a retrospective audit conducted at Nottingham Children's Hospital tertiary paediatric nephrology centre. Inclusion criteria were patients with a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome, on tacrolimus therapy undergoing a routine renal biopsy to assess for evidence of tacrolimus toxicity over a 10-year period (1/1/2011 to 31/ 12/2020). Patients were identified using a histopathology biopsy database with clinical information collected from electronic medical notes. Results: 44 patients were included (male 66%). The mean age of starting tacrolimus was 4 years, with the interval between commencing treatment and biopsy 34 months. On the patient's first renal biopsy, 41% (18/44) had histological evidence of nephrotoxicity.

However, decisions to discontinue tacrolimus were multifactorial and tacrolimus was not stopped based on biopsy results alone. Intriguingly, repeat biopsies on some patients with initial toxicity showed apparent histological improvement on subsequent biopsy. Future work will compare our practices with that of other UK centres and answer whether biopsy monitoring on tacrolimus should be mandated.""",1.0,clinical,True

1007,"Introduction: Multidrug Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome (MRNS) is a dramatically challenging condition that may lead to end-stage renal disease and post-transplant recurrence. Immunoadsorption of Immunoglobulins (IA) has been reported safe and efficient to induce remission, however most patients relapse after discontinuation, and some happen to be IA-dependent. Long-lived plasma-cells may be responsible for refractory NS. We report the use of Daratumumab(DARA), an antiCD38 monoclonal antibody that targets plasma cells, in IAdependent MRNS. Material and methods: In this retrospective multicenter study, we included children with MRNS that reached complete remission after IA, but relapsed when lowering frequency of IA sessions despite B-cell depletion. We report on a further attempt of IA withdrawal adding 4 weekly infusions of daratumumab of 1000mg/1.73m2. Results: Four boys and 2 girls were included. Median age at diagnosis was 6.1 years (range 5.5-7.9). Renal biopsy showed FSGS in 3 patients and MCD in 3. All had negative genetic testing. All were resistant to ciclosporine and/or tacrolimus, 4 also received MMF and 3 rituximab(RTX). Median time between INS diagnosis and IA initiation was 1 year (0.5-5.6). All patients achieved complete remission after IA but relapsed after a first discontinuation attempt, despite B-cell depletion with RTX(n,3) or Obinutuzumab(OBI) (n,3). Complete remission was again obtained with intensive IA in all but one with partial remission. All patients received a new infusion of anti-CD20 (obinutuzumab) followed by 4 injections of daratumumab. Complete remission was sustained in all patients enabling IA withdrawal. Proteinuria relapsed in 4 patients (RPC 0.05-0.10g/mmol) and was successfully treated with either a single reinjection of daratumumab (n,2) or combined to OBI and/or IA. All patients were in complete remission at 7 months (range 1.5-17.5) following IA discontinuation. Conclusions: The association of plasma-cell depletion with daratumumab to B-cell depletion allowed IA discontinuation in all patients with Ig-IA dependent MRNS. Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of daratumumab in children with MRNS and better define its place in the treatment strategy.",1.0,disease,True

The aim of this study was to assess these outcomes and related variables in children with new onset SSNS. Material and methods: Dutch and Belgian children (n,""46) aged 2-16 years with first onset SSNS participated in a randomised placebocontrolled trial (LEARNS) between April 2018 and December 2020. To measure HRQoL and psychosocial functioning, children (age 8 years, self-report) and/or their parents (proxy-report) completed two online generic patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) at 4 weeks after first onset: the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Total and subscale scores and the proportion of children with impaired HRQoL (<1 SD) or clinical scores for strengths and difficulties (<10th and >90th percentile, respectively) were compared to the Dutch norm population. Multivariate regression analyses were used to asses related variables of HRQoL. Results: Forty patients (87%) completed the PROMs. Older children (818 years) reported significantly lower HRQoL on the total scale and the physical and emotional functioning subscales compared to the reference group. A high proportion (>45%) of these children reported impaired HRQoL scores. No differences in HRQoL between children aged 2-4 or 5-7 years and the reference group was found, except for higher scores on social functioning (5-7 years). A small proportion of children scored within the clinical range on psychosocial functioning. No variables related to HRQoL or psychosocial functioning could be identified. Conclusions: In children with new onset SSNS receiving high doses of steroids, HRQoL and psychosocial functioning was moderately affected, which was more profound in older children. Longitudinal data could provide important insight in the evolution and predictors of HRQoL in SSNS.""",1.0,disease,True

The aim of our study was to find genetic correlations between our cohort of children with severe CAKUT phenotypes and relevant genetic findings, using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Material and methods: Cinical study was performed including 324 CAKUT patients, who had a blood sample for DNA isolation withdrawn. Afterwards, 113 patients with most severe CAKUT were selected for Whole Exome Next-generation sequencing using NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System and Agilents&#39; SureSelect Human All Exon V6 workflow. All enrolled children had more than one CAKUT and almost all of them ( 93.8%) had vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Results: We found 11 very low population frequency variants (mutations/insertions/deletions) that were present in all 113 patients. 7 of them were splice region mutations, 3 frameshift mutations and 1 missense mutation. Every locus with identified variants in all 113 patients presents many insertions/deletions, thus each locus can be interpreted as a mutation hotspot. Two MUC16 variants on chromosome 19 have been also discovered and may contribute to the phenotype as compound heterozygous mutations if present in different alleles. Further research in terms of genetic testing of parents is needed to elucidate the role of MUC16 in CAKUT. We hypothesise that compound heterozygous variants in MUC16 may present a monogenic VUR aetiology. Conclusions: In every single included patient with severe CAKUT 11 mutual mutations were found, which is rather uncommon in such studies, promising important findings, warranting further elucidation and confirmation. Both mutations on chromosome 19 are especially interesting as they may present a monogenic VUR aetiology in terms of compound heterozygote.",1.0,disease,True

Antibiotic treatment is usually initiated empirically, based on symptomatology, blood and urine analysis, knowing the potential pathogen distribution and sensitivity patterns in population. However, resistance patterns should be monitored regularly in order to keep guidelines up to date. The aim of this study was to assess and compare antibiotic sensitivity and resistance patterns during 2005-2011 and 2017-2021. Material and methods: We retrospectively reviewed hospital records for patients aged 1 months to 3 years, who were discharged from Nephrology department, with a principal diagnosis of the first febrile UTI, during the two study periods: January 1st, 2005 - December 31st, 2011 (Group 1) and January 1st, 2017 - June 30th, 2021 (Group 2). Urine samples from each patient were obtained at admission before initiating antimicrobial therapy. Urine culture and antibiogram results were analysed. Antibiotic resistance rates were checked for: ampicillin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), gentamicin, amikacin, ceftazidime and imipenem. Results: A total of 690 patients were included in the study, 502 (72.8%) in Group 1 and 188 (27.2%) in Group 2. The median age of all patients was 0.4 (IQR 0.3-0.8) years.

Urine DKK3 levels, eGFR and urine albumin to creatinine ratio were measured at baseline and at least 6 months of follow-up in children with CAKUT. These values were compared between the CKD groups and with the control group. Results: A total of 113 patients with CKD stage 1-4 and 28 healthy controls were included into the study. Baseline urine DKK3/creatinine ratio was negatively correlated with eGFR and positively correlated with urine albumin creatinine ratio.

With our current understanding, however, a majority of cases cannot yet be explained. The objective of this study was to determine whether postzygotic mutations could play a role in the aetiology of SFK by investigating monozygotic twins discordant for SFK. Material and methods: Two monozygotic twin pairs, each consisting of one child with congenital SFK and a healthy sibling, were identified in the SOFIA study. DNA was isolated from saliva samples and exomes were captured using Twist Biosciences enrichment kits. Next, whole exome sequencing was performed with a targeted sequencing depth of 300 (NovaSeg6000, Illumina).

1060,"Introduction: KBG syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome associated with mutations or deletions in ANKRD11. Named for the three families first identified, features of KBG syndrome include macrodontia of upper central incisors, distinctive facies, skeletal abnormalities, seizures, and developmental delay. To date renal manifestations have not been described in the literature. ANKRD11 gene encodes for ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein which inhibits ligand-dependent activation of transcription. It is expressed in the kidney. We present two cases which, for the first time, describe kidney anomalies in children with KBG syndrome. Material and methods: We retrospectively reviewed paediatric cases of KBG syndrome associated with renal anomalies presenting to Great Ormond Street Hospital in 2021. Genetic diagnosis was made with the GOSHome gene panel test (DDTOP). Results: Two cases have been identified. A 4-year-old female presenting with seizures, developmental delay, and bilateral conductive hearing loss. Genetic testing identified a heterozygous frameshift mutation in ANKRD11 c.1356_1359del p.(Asn452Lysfs*2).

Ultrasound revealed bilateral pelvicalyceal and ureteric dilatation, loss of corticomedullary differentiation but appropriately grown kidneys. The long-term prognosis is unknown and thus both are undergoing follow up. Conclusions: To date more than 200 cases of KBG syndrome have been reported in the literature. This is the first description of an association with kidney anomalies. Imaging and assessment of kidney function should be performed in those diagnosed with KBG syndrome.

Glomerular filtration ratio (GFR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) become altered only in advanced SCN. The main goal of the BIODREPA study is to assess non-invasive biomarkers of kidney injury as a tool to detect SCN in children. Material and methods: Multicentre prospective cohort study of paediatric patients with SCD. The primary outcome was a composite of decreased GFR (<90 mL/min/1,73m2), albuminuria (uACR >30 mg/g), or abnormal findings in kidney ultrasound. Urinary levels of alpha-glutathione S-transferase (a-GST), neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipocalin (NGAL), and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM1) were compared between groups defined according to the primary outcome. Results: We report data from the 65 patients included in the initial crosssectional analysis of the BIODREPA study. The median age was 8.4 years (IQR 5.5-12.5) and 57% were male. Median GFR was 149 mL/ min/1,73 m2 (IQR 124-164). The primary outcome was met by 59.7% of the cohort (low GFR in 0%; albuminuria in 6.2%; and abnormal kidney ultrasound in 57.1%).

Material and methods: Five patients with hypophosphatemic ricket were referred for molecular genetic testing. Four patients underwent WGS followed by reanalysis of genomic data; NGS panel data were reanalyzed for one. Experimental investigation of the effect of two variants on splicing was performed using minigene assay and RNA analysis. Results: Primary NGS data analysis didn't reveal causative variants for patients or there was only one variant in SLC34A1 and SLC34A3. Secondary investigation of NGS data revealed previously missed inframe deletion p.91_97del in SLC34A1with global frequency 1,7% in two patients in compound heterozygous state. Intronic deletion c.925+ 20_926-48del101 in SLC34A3 was found in two brothers. Both variants were previously described as pathogenic. Missed synonymous VUS c.1449G>A in SLC34A1 was detected in one. Minigene assay showed that the variant leads to truncation of exon 13 by 34 nucleotides with PTC formation that allows us to reclassify the variant as likely pathogenic. Another synonymous c.846G>A variant in SLC34A3 was also missed during primary investigation. Functional study was performed by RTPCR and identified the variant as splicing one, leading to skipping of exon 8 without frameshift. Conclusions: A molecular genetic diagnosis of HHRH and IIH2 is extremely significant for early diagnosis, correct treatment optionsand genetic counseling. Reanalysis of genomic data is important not only over time, but also by different clinical bioinformaticians. Some pathogenic variants with high global frequency could be filtered out during early stages of NGS analysis. Functional analysis allows to reclassify VUS and investigate the pathogenicity previously described variants.",1.0,clinical,True

Here, we report a girl with a novel homozygous pathogenic variant in CENPF gene, presented with end stage renal diseases (ESRD) with Stromme syndrome clinical features. Material and methods: An 8-year-old girl was admitted with anemia, growth retardation and metabolic acidosis. (Urea: 173 mg/dl, Cre: 10 mg/ dl, PTH: 947, Ca 6.6 mg/dl, P 8.3 mg/dl, K 5.95, Hb: 7.5 g/dL HCO3: 12 9 . She was hypertensive (170/100 mmHg). Weight was 26 kg (25-50 p, 0.43 SDS), height was 114 cm (< 3p, -2.93 SDS), head circumference was 43 cm (< 3p, -6.27 SDS), dysmorphic facial appearance was present. Emergency hemodialysis was performed. She was investigated for the etiology of chronic kidney disease. C3 and C4 levels were found to be normal. Tubular tests were defective (Pro/ Cre: 3.2 mg/mg, FeNa 8.2, FeK 59.8, TPR: 51%). Microcephaly, mega cisterna magna, hypoplasia in the right cerebellar hemisphere were detected due to cranial MRI. Posterior embryotoxon was detected in the left eye. For the molecular genetic evaluation of the patient, SNP microarray analysis was performed at fist-step and no clinically significant variant was detected. Results: For further evaluation, WES was performed. The patient was found to carry a homozygous c.117del (p.Gln40SerfsTer26) variant in (ENST00000366955.3) CENPF gene. This variant was not previously reported in databases or literature and according to the ACMG criteria (PVS1, PM2, PP3) it was interpreted as a novel ""Pathogenic"" variant. Conclusions: The centromeric protein F (CENPF) human ciliopathy gene was included in the ciliopathy-related diseases group in 2016.

1086,"Introduction: Genetic screening is rapidly moving from a research tool to the first-line diagnostic procedure for hereditary kidney diseases. We examined the current state of genetic screening for hereditary nephropathies in Europe. Material and methods: Since 2019, the European Rare Kidney Disease Registry (ERKReg) has monitored diagnostic procedures in >13.000 patients at 75 centers in 24 European countries. Here we evaluated the use of genetic screening in 4.242 registry patients diagnosed with a rare kidney disease from 01/16-12/21. Results: Genetic screening was performed in 1.259 patients, including 53% of all patients with tubulopathies (TP) and metabolic nephropathies (MNP), 39% of ciliopathy patients, 38% of patients presenting with thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA), 27% of glomerulopathy and 11% of CAKUT patients. Genetic screening for hereditary diseases was ordered twice as common in pediatric as in adult patients (36% v. 18%). Among the patients screened, a genetic diagnosis was established in 96% of MNP, 92% of ciliopathies, 91% of TP, 68% of TMA and 56% of CAKUT cases. The screening turnaround time shortened over time to a current median of 3.4 months. Notable differences were noticed between countries, with a range of 1.3 months in Germany to 10.5 months in Italy. Sanger sequencing of individual genes was used in 22%, NGS gene panels in 63% and whole exome sequencing in 15% of patients. Median turnaround time was 2.5 months for Sanger, 3.3 months for NGS panel screening, and 5.8 months for whole exome sequencing. In those patients in whom a genetic diagnosis was established, median time to genetic diagnosis was 10 months from disease onset, and 8.5 months from referral to the specialist center. Conclusions: Genetic screening yields remarkably high diagnostic confirmation rates. While decreasing, laboratory turnaround times still require improvement to maximize the clinical usefulness of genetic screening.",1.0,disease,True

1096,"Introduction: Objective: To highlight the role of low sodium in early recognition of severe cardiac involvement in children presenting with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Material and methods: We describe a case series of nine patients, aged from 3,5 to 15,5 years that presented to our hospital during last winter and fulfilled the criteria of MIS-C with fever, elevated inflammatory markers and involvement of at least two organ systems, following a recent Covid19 infection. Results: Eight out of 9 patients experienced gastrointestinal symptoms, 2/9 had lymphopenia, 3/9 thrombocytopenia and 2/9 children had severe hypoalbuminemia. Only one child developed decreased renal function, which was confirmed by high plasma urea and creatinine levels. However, hyponatremia (sodium:125-135mmol/L), was detected in 8/9 children (88.8%), which was severe in 3 children (33.3%). Severe hyponatremia was associated with severe cardiac involvement, as well as with remarkable high brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) values, combined with only a slight increase in troponin levels. Echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular dysfunction (EF:50-55%) in 6/9 children, pericardial effusion (mild in 5/9, moderate in 2/9), and coronary artery dilation in 2/9 children. All patients were treated with intravenous human immunoglobin (IVIG), corticosteroids and low-dose of aspirin and only one child needed cardiac support with milrinone. Conclusions: Children with MIS-C often develop hyponatremia, the severity of which is related to the severity of the disease. Hyponatremia in MIS-C has been associated with inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, probably caused by the cytokine storm. Furthermore, high BNP levels in MIS-C patients, are mainly related to myocardial edema and not to myocardial cell damage, as observed in myocarditis, and to natriuresis, probably another underlying mechanism associated with hyponatremia.",1.0,case,True

The aim of this study is to investigate the rate of hypertension and the renal damage in children who had COVID19 infection. Material and methods: A total of 97 children, 61 girls and 36 boys, aged between 4-18 years, who were admitted to the Pediatric Nephrology and Pediatric Cardiology outpatient clinics with a history of COVID-19 at least 3 months ago are included in this study. A total of 22 healthy children, 13 girls and 9 boys, similar to the patient group in terms of age and gender, were included in the control group. A 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement was performed in all of the cases included in the study. Blood and urinalysis results were recorded retrospectively from patient files and hospital electronic medical records. Results: When the patient and control groups were compared in terms of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring findings, hypertension was found in 35 (36%) of 97 patients included in the study, whereas hypertension was found in only 1 (4.5%) of 22 patients in the control group. The mean 24-hour, day and nighttime mean arterial pressure, nighttime systolic blood pressure and blood pressure load are statistically significantly higher in the group that had COVID-19 compared to the controls. In addition, 24-hour, day and nighttime heart rate, systolic and diastolic dipping are found to be statistically significantly lower in the group who had COVID-19. Statistically significant elevations were found in the group with COVID-19 infection in terms of hemoglobin, hematocrit, creatinine, and potassium. Conclusions: In this study, the hypertension rate of patients with COVID-19 infection is found to be higher than the control group, and it is an important finding that they are non-dipper in addition to being hypertensive. Moreover, the blood creatinine level, which is one of the biochemical parameters retrieved from the patients, is found to be higher than the controls group, suggesting that COVID-19 infection affects renal glomerular functions but not renal tubular functions.",1.0,COVID-19,True

This study aimed to assess the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in pediatric CKD patients followed up at a tertiary center. Material and methods: A questionnaire including demographics, COVID-19 history, symptoms, vaccination status was applied to patients with glomerular disease treated with immunosuppression, CKD stage 2- 5, dialysis patients, and kidney transplant recipients followed up between March 2020-January 2022. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was staged according to KDIGO criteria. COVID-19 was diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction in nasal swab samples and severity was categorized according to the National Institute of Health criteria. Results: 220 patients were included, 48 were found (21.8%) to have experienced COVID-19. There was no significant difference regarding age, gender, underlying kidney disease, CKD stage, dialysis status, type or number of immunosuppressive medications, and glomerular filtration rate between patients with and without COVID-19 history.

We previously reported an unusual number of graft arterial anomalies following kidney transplantation (KTx) in children during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave (Berteloot et al. Am J Transplant21). We report herein the one-year follow-up of these patients. Material and methods: In this retrospective study, we included all children who received a KTx at our center from February-July 2020. Results: Among the 9 children who received a KTx at our center between February and July 2020 (8 boys, median age 10 years (3-17)), 8 presented Doppler features suggesting arterial stenosis, with an unusual extensive pattern (Fig.1) after a median delay of 13 days (8-113). For comparison, persistent spectral Doppler arterial anomalies were observed in only 5% of children following KTx at our center over the previous 5-year period, and were all focal anastomotic stenoses. In addition, five children had lymphoceles, which required surgical management as compared to only one patient in the 5 previous years (1%). We retrospectively diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection in 6/8 children with arterial stenosis on serologies performed at D0, including one boy with a history of positive RT-PCR 120 days before KTx. None of the patients had reported any symptom suggestive of COVID-19. The remaining 2 patients had received a graft from an asymptomatic deceased adolescent donor with a positive serology at D0. These data led us to suspect immune postviral graft vasculitis, triggered by SARS-CoV-2. At one year post-transplantation, the outcome was favorable in the 8 isolated KTx recipients. 4/8 children had normal blood pressure and 4 had controlled high blood pressure on mono or bitherapy. Doppler anomalies had resolved in 5/8 and persisted in 3/8 with a trend for improvement of peak systolic velocities and no severe consequences on kidney function and histology. Indeed, the median GFR was 91ml/min/1.73m² (65-129), with unspecific and mild lesions on 4/8 protocol kidney biopsies (IFTA 1 or Cpt 1). One liver-kidney graft recipient had persistent hypertension and diffuse irregular inflammatory parietal thickening of the whole vascular graft associated with a parietal thrombus upstream of the birth of the 2 hepatic arteries Conclusions: Our case series suggests a risk of postviral kidney graft vasculitis in children with a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection in the recipient or donor.

We also strongly recommend vaccination of all people aged >5 years in the household.",1.0,negative,True

1134,"Introduction: Considering the uncontrolled pandemic there is an urgent need for studies on the safety profile of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccination in children with chronic kidney conditions. Currently in Turkey COVID-19 vaccines are in use for the adolescent population. We aimed to investigate the side-effect and safety profile of COVD-19 vaccines available for adolescents with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at our center. Material and methods: The study population included patients with CKD stage 2-5, glomerular disease treated with immunosuppression, patients on dialysis, and kidney transplant recipients followed-up during the pandemic. A questionnaire including demographic and medical information, history of COVID-19 infection, vaccination status, and vaccinerelated side effects was administered to the patients. Results: Ninety eight patients (55 girls, 43 boys) were vaccinated by CoronaVac-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (n,16) or BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVD-19 (n,"" 82) vaccine. The mean age was 16.90 ± 2,36 years and median follow-up 4,9 (0,5-11,03) months. There were 36 stage 2-5 CKD, 8 dialysis, and 24 transplant patients in the cohort. The most common side effects were local pain (46,9 %), fatigue (17,3 %) and fever (11,2 %). No serious side effects were observed. Median duration of the symptoms was 2 (1-30) days. The longest symptom took 30 days; as dizziness in one patient with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. No renal disease flare was observed post-vaccination and 11 (11,2 %) patients experienced mild COVID-19 infection (according to NIH criteria). Although side effects with mRNA seemed more frequent than the inactivated vaccine, it was statistically insignificant (p"",""0,10). No significant relationship was found between frequency of side effects and age, glomerular filtration rate, immunosuppressive treatments, CKD stage, and the underlying disease. Conclusions: Although studies with longer follow-up are needed to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, our early experience showed that vaccination is safe in the young population with CKD.""",1.0,pandemic,True

Yet, children with normal USG might still have abnormal scintigraphy. We aimed to compare the children with normal USG/normal scintigraphy with those having normal USG/abnormal scintigraphy. Material and methods: Children with UTI and normal USG were grouped as normal vs pathologic scintigraphy. Two groups were compared for demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging data. Patients with resolving vs persistent pathologic scintigraphy findings were also compared for the same parameters. Results: 147 patients [122 (83%) female; mean age 62±47 months (1-203)] were enrolled. Serum creatinine was normal in all patients. Patients with pathologic scintigraphy (n,""58) were older, had higher creatinine and erythrocyte sedimentation rate compared to those with normal DMSA (n"",""89). They also had higher frequency of increased C-reactive protein (CRP) level, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), antibiotic prophylaxis and antireflux surgery. VUR was the most significant parameter predicting pathological scintigraphy. Patients with persistent pathological scintigraphy (n"",""30) had lower BMI SDS, lower urine specific gravity and higher CRP compared to those with resolving scintigraphy findings (n"",""9). VCUG was performed in 30 out of 46 children under 2 years of age and 19 of them (63%) had VUR. While DMSA scan was pathologic in 6 (32%) of those with VUR, only 1 of 11 (9%) children without VUR had pathological DMSA scan. Conclusions: VUR and high CRP increase the probability of pathologic DMSA in children presenting with UTI and normal USG. Thus, ordering DMSA in children with UTI despite normal USG is feasible if CRP is increased at presentation. Presence of VUR and pathologic DMSA in 2/3 and 1/3 of children <2 years of age, respectively, contradicts the American Academy of Pediatricss suggestion that """"if urinary system ultrasonography is normal in children under 2 years of age with UTI, no additional examination is required.""""""",1.0,clinical,True

1150,"Introduction: Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants (G1 and G2) have been reported to be associated with increased risk of sickle cell nephropathy (SCN) in African population. APOL1 risk variants are associated with hemoglobinuria, albuminuria and hyperfiltration in sickle cell disease (SCD), but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. We hypothesized that cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) released during hemolysis in patients with SCD is a second-hit factor for APOL1-mediated SCN. Material and methods: Conditionally immortalized podocytes (ciPodocytes) expressing different genotypes of APOL1 were stimulated with sickle hemoglobin (Hb S) (0-500 g/ml, corresponding to 0-30 M of heme molar equivalents) or heme (0-30 M) for different time periods. Subsequently, the effect of HbS or heme on ciPodocytes were assessed via Resazurin cell viability assay and real-time quantitative PCR (RTqPCR). Results: Exposure of ciPodocytes to at least 100 g/ml of cell-free HbS or 12 M of heme for 24 hours causes a significant decreased in cell viability. This decrease in cell viability was independent on the APOL1 genotype of the podocytes. APOL1 G0/G0 ciPodocyte cell line also showed a time and concentration dependent upregulation of APOL1 mRNA. Conclusions: This study provides proof that cell-free Hb or heme at a concentration seen in vivo in patients with SCD can be toxic to the podocytes and can lead to higher expression of APOL1.",1.0,disease,True

1154,"Introduction: Urinary tract obstruction during renal development leads to inflammation, leukocyte infiltration, tubular cell death and interstitial fibrosis. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine, produced mainly by monocytes/macrophages and regulatory T-cells. IL-10 inhibits the innate and adaptive immune response. A protective, antiinflammatory and antifibrotic effect of IL-10 after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) was shown in the adult mouse kidney. We studied the role of IL-10 in the neonatal mouse kidney with UUO. Material and methods: Newborn transgenic mice (IL-10-/-) and C57BL/ 6 wildtype-mice (WT) were subjected to either UUO or sham operation at day 2 of life. Whole kidneys were harvested at day 3, 7, and 14 of life. The kidneys were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (inflammation (F4/80, CD3), cell death (TUNEL, PAS), fibrosis (MT, collagen I, SMA)), by Westernblot (PARP, caspase-8, RIPK3 (necroptosis), GSDME (pyroptosis), -SMA, vimentin, TGF-ß, E-cadherin, -catenin) and by FACS-analysis (leukocyte subpopulations: B-cells, CD11bhi, cDC1, cDC2, Ly6C+, MHCII+F4/80hi, MHCII-F4/80hi, neutrophils, monocytes, T-cells).",1.0,protective,True

IL-10-/- mice showed reduced infiltration of CD11bhi, Ly6C+, cDC1 and T-cells, and increased infiltration of neutrophils after UUO compared to WT. As an indicator for apoptosis, PARP expression and caspase-8 cleavage increased after UUO. IL-10-/- mice with UUO exhibited a decrease in necroptosis (RIPK3/RIP3) but no difference in apoptosis (PARP and caspase-8), pyroptosis (GSDME) and fibrosis (-SMA, vimentin, E-cadherin, -catenin) compared to WT. Expression of TGF- increased in WT-mice with UUO at d14 and was less in pronounced in IL-10-/- mice. Conclusions: Contrary to our expectations, IL-10-/- mice demonstrated no increase in cell death, inflammation, or profibrotic cytokines in comparison to WT following UUO. These results suggest that IL-10 signaling plays a minor role in tuning down the inflammatory response following UUO in the neonatal kidney than in the adult kidney.",0.0,,False

Avacopan, called CCX168, is an orally administered small-molecule C5aR antagonist that blocks the effects of C5a, which is one of the most potent pro-inflammatory mediators of the complement system. Results: CASE REPORT An 11-yr old girl with a biopsy-proven C3GN, was initially treated with three IV boli of methyllprednisolone then tapered to oral prednisone (PDN) associated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and ACE inhibitor. In the following months, cyclosporine (CyA) was added to the therapy due to the relapse of proteinuria (UPCR 1.19 mg/mg). The patient never achieved complete remission and therefore was enrolled in the ChemoCentryx CL011_168 study. In the first 26 weeks, during the double-blind period the girl developed pneumoniae with a significant increase in proteinuria. At the beginning of the open-label phase of the trial UPCR was 2.09 mg/ mg. Following start of avacopan, a progressive reduction of proteinuria was observed reaching values around 0.5 mg/mg. In the last 4 weeks of the study, avacopan was discontinued, with subsequent proteinuria increase to > 1 mg/mg. The patient also reported increased fatigue. After about 3 months, authorization for a compassionate use of avacopan was obtained with improvement in physical well-being and reduction of proteinuria to around 0.5 mg/mg. CyA was discontinued but it was rapidly reintroduced due to a transient increase of proteinuria. In the following months, proteinuria remained low despite the interruption of MMF. At the last follow up, UPCR was 0.29 mg/mg and renal function was normal. The drug was well tolerated. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the safety and efficacy of avacopan in a pediatric case of C3GN.",1.0,flu,True

Recognition of AKI and referral to a pediatric nephrology clinic are important to improve the outcome of these patients. Our goals were to study the incidence of AKI in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), whether the team was recognizing AKI and if the patients were being referred for follow-up. Material and methods: Retrospective study of all the patients admitted to a PICU in an academic hospital during 6 months (Jan-Jun 2021). Newborns, children with previous chronic kidney disease and readmissions were excluded. AKI was defined according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). Results: We studied 135 patients (median age 8 years old; 50% males; 75% with chronic diseases; 61% post-surgery). AKI was identified in 61 patients (45%): 44% mild; 49% moderate and 7% severe. Five patients (8%) had creatinine elevation, 33 (54%) had oliguria and 23 (38%) had both criteria. The admission diagnosis was paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) in 13 patients and 10 (77%) developed AKI. PIMS-TS was a risk factor for AKI (p<0.05). Mechanical ventilation was more frequent in patients with AKI (34% vs 5%; p<0.0001). Patients with AKI had higher average hospital stay (p<0.0001) and higher mortality (7% vs 0%; p<0.05). Only 15 patients (25%) had AKI diagnosis at the PICU discharge note. There was only one referral to follow-up at the Pediatric Nephrology clinic of a patient with severe AKI. Conclusions: In this cohort of critically ill children, AKI was frequent and it was associated with a higher hospital stay and death. Notably, AKI was underdiagnosed and pediatric nephrologists rarely followed these patients. New strategies will be put into practice to improve the care of these children.",1.0,disease,True

1175,"Introduction: Genetic causes of nephrotic syndrome are not thoroughly studied, and nowadays, including more populations in these researches can complete a picture of the mutation spectrum characterizing certain regions. Material and methods: Up to date, we examined 220 children with primary nephrotic syndrome (NS), including congenital and infantile ones. All children underwent a molecular genetic examination by the new generation sequencing (NGS) of target regions of 200 genes associated with hereditary kidney diseases. Results: As a result of our study, 142 nucleotide variants were identified in 31 genes, causative mutations were found in 61.3% of cases.Nucleotide variants in the NPHS2 gene were detected in 27 children (12.2%), COL4A5 - in 18 children (8.1%), WT1 - in 17 children (7.7%), mutations in other genes were found less than 5% each. We verified the major mutations prevailing in Russian children: c.259G>T, p.E87*, c.868G>A, p.V290M, and c.686G>A, p.R229Q in NPHS2 gene. The first variant occurred in 14 (51.9%) children; 10 were in the homozygous state. Two others we identified in 6 children each. The most common nucleotide variant in the NPHS1 gene was the nonsense mutation c.3478C>T, p.R1160*, which occurred in the genomes of 3 children. During the follow-up period, 56 children (25.5%) reached CKD stage 3, and 37 children (16.8%) - CKD stage 5. We didnt reveal any gene with a greater likelihood of decreased kidney function. Conclusions: Based on a voluminous monocenter study, a genetic characteristic of Russian children is given for the first time, reflecting the spectrum and frequencies of nucleotide variants that cause NS.",1.0,disease,True

1181,"Introduction: Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is an acute clinical picture characterized by endothelial damage secondary to various causes that leads to thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and progressive decline in renal function.There are several underlying causes,including a very rare but serious one caused by invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae (SN) infection that is associated with a worse clinical course and higher mortality.This presentation is on average in younger patients compared to typical HUS.Our objective is to present a case of Sp-HUS with an atypical evolution and resolution, associated with alterations in complement regulatory proteins Material and methods: We present the case of a 5-year-old boy with no pathological history of interest who at 20 months of age presented a picture of acute otitis media treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid without improvement and an unfortunate clinical course leading to a worsening of the general condition and a hemodynamic instability.In the emergency department,a chest x-ray was performed, showing complicated pneumonia that required pleural drainage,along with blood tests showing anemia,thrombocytopenia,coombs+ test, and positive PCR for SN.These results being compatible with a diagnosis of Sp-HUS Results: From that moment,treatment was started with ceftriaxone,transfusion therapy,bicarbonate supplementation and antihypertensive therapy. During hospitalization,he developed anuric acute renal failure that required 12 sessions of renal replacement therapy,beginning with spontaneous diuresis on day 15 of his evolution,with subsequent recovery of renal function until reaching an estimated GFR by creatinine after 2 years of follow up of 87 ml/min/1.73 m2, as well as complete normalization of proteinuria.The renal biopsy performed at the time of the symptoms showed no signs compatible with TMA or signs of chronicity.Genetic study carried out subsequently detected an alteration in the sialization of factor H (FH) probably due to the pneumococcus and responsible for the clinical picture of our patient Conclusions: Sp-HUS has a more severe initial behavior with a longer duration of oliguria and thrombocytopenia or extrarenal manifestations (hearing loss),requiring renal replacement therapy in around 7080%.aHUS risk variants in the CFH-CFHR3-CFHR1 region could contribute to disease predisposition to Sp-HUS.Transient desalination of complement FH by pneumococcal neuraminidase may play a role in disease pathogenesis",1.0,clinical,True

Treatment consisted in PEX or ECZ followed by mycophenolate mofetyl (MMF) as maintenance treatment in severe cases in Italy and ECZ (+/- Ig-Immunoadsorption (Ig-IA)) and Rituximab (RTX) followed by steroids and MMF as maintenance treatment in France. Results: Median age at onset was 4,3[3,0;5,3] and median GFR was 17[15;22]ml/min/1,73m². All patients presented manifestations of TMA and 3 extrarenal manifestations. Median anti-CFH antibodies levels was 8129[17654;23188]UA/mL. Treatment consisted in ECZ in 7 patients combined with PEX/Ig-IA in 2 patients and 1 patient received PEX only. RTX was added in 3 patients Median duration of ECZ treatment was 24 months and MMF was added in 5 patients. Anti-CFH ab levels decreased in all but one patient with no clear difference between treatment groups. Ab levels decreased spontaneously in patients without maintenance therapy. All patients rapidly improved with all but one patient recovering a normal kidney function (median time to normalization 1,4[0,5;2,2]months) and all reaching hematological remission in a median time of 2,0[1,0;2,3] months. At last follow-up, 4 patients were under treatment (2ECZ, 2 MMF) and 5 were off treatment without experiencing relapse. Anti-CFH levels at treatment withdrawal ranged from 0 to 1645UA/mL. Conclusions: ECZ is effective to achieve remission in anti-CFH HUS. MMF and/or RTX seem effective in decreasing anti-CFH ab levels but spontaneous decrease is seen in some patients.

While the role of donor specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) in the pathogenesis of allograft damage has been largely demonstrated, the role of non-donor specific antibodies (NDSA) is still controversial. This study was aimed to evaluate the occurrence of NDSA in pediatric renal transplant recipients and their correlation with clinical outcomes. Material and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 52 pediatric renal transplant recipients undergone to anti-HLA antibodies monitoring between 2015 and 2018. Antibodies were measured out 6, 12 and 24 months after transplantation. Protocol biopsies were performed at the same timeline. Collected data included creatinine, eGFR, proteinuria, immunosuppressive therapy, viral infections, rejections. Patients were divided into 4 groups: without antibodies (NA), with NDSA only (NDSA), with both DSA and NDSA (DSA+NDSA), and with DSA only (DSA). Results: All groups had similar demographic and clinical characteristics. Occurrence of DSA and NDSA was similar (15% of patients) 6 months after-transplantation (PO), while 8% had both DSA and NDSA. 12 months PO, 19% of patients had DSA, 21% NDSA and 12% both. 24 months PO, 15% had DSA, 11% NDSA and 10% both.

1197,"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) infection affects every organ, including the kidney, ranging from an asymptomatic state to critical illness as well as a post-inflammatory response. Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) characterized by fever and organ dysfunction in the setting of recent COVID-19 infection. The cause of kidney involvement in COVID 19 is multifactorial, including acute tubular injury, direct renal cell invasion, immune dysregulation with systemic cytokine activation, and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Material and methods: We presented three patients with MIS-C and Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) related to COVID-19. Results: Three of our patients' presented with persistent fever, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. A high level of clinical suspicion for MIS-C was supported by laboratory findings (elevated ESR, CRP, D-dimers, and fibrinogen) along with positive IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In the third patient, both PCR PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was positive. Three patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (2 g/kg), intravenous pulse methylprednisolone (10-30 mg/kg/day) for 3-6 days, followed by oral prednisolone treatment (2 mg/kg/day). Two patients had signs of TMA (non-immune hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury) with hyper inflammation at the time of admission and received renal replacement therapy. On the fourth day of admission, the third patient developed oliguria, anemia, and thrombocytopenia compatible with the hemolytic uremic syndrome. Their coagulation tests, ADAMTS 13 activity, was normal and serum complement level 3 was low in two patients and normal range in one patient. Eculizumab was administered to the first and second cases who had no response to plasmapheresis, a persistent anuric condition, after the second dose of Eculizumab, clinical improvement, including down-trend of the hemolytic episode and increase in urine output. Despite improved kidney function, persistently high levels of ferritin, LDH, and ongoing decline of platelet count, anakinra was added to the treatment in one patient. At the follow-up, three patients had normal kidney functions. Conclusions: Herein, we presented three patients with MIS-C and hemolytic uremic syndrome.

Material and methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data from all paediatric patients treated with liposomal amphotericin B in our centre from january/2017 to december/2021. We aimed to analyse the incidence of nephrotoxicity. The composite renal outcome was defined by the occurrence of AKI (creatinine rise >1.5x baseline) or tubulopathy (need for electrolyte replacement, glycosuria or polyuria). Results: A total of 76 children were included, with a median age of 3.8 years (P25-P75: 1.2-10.3) and 50% were male. Median treatment duration was 10 days (P25-P75: 6-16). During the course of treatment, 17 (22%) patients died and 6 (8%) had to withdrawal treatment due to adverse effects. The composite renal outcome was achieved in 68 (89%) patients, with AKI occurring in 36 (47%) and tubulopathy in 58 (83%). Serum creatinine increased in 54 (71%) patients, rising 0.14 mg/dL (P25P75: 0.05-0.5; range 0.01-2.28) or 44% (P25-P75: 16-168) above baseline. Peak creatinine was reached by day 7 (P25-P75 3-10; range 0-21) and returned to baseline by day 13 (P25-75: 6-16; range 0-32). Among the 56 (75%) who needed electrolyte replacement, maximum doses were 3.5 mEq of KCl/Kg/day (P25-P75: 2.0-5.4) and 5.5 mEq of NaCl/Kg/day (P25-P75: 3.0-13.0). Minimum serum potassium levels were significantly higher in patients with AKI (3.0 [P25-75: 2.9-3.1] versus 2.7 [2.5-3.0], pvalue 0.04). No other significant differences were found. The presence of comorbidities was a significant predictor of tubulopathy in a logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex, and the severity of AKI (OR 5.9, CI95% 1.4-24.7, p-value 0.015).

1212,"Introduction: Cystinosis is a rare, incurable autosomal recessive storage kidney disease caused by mutations in CTNS gene, which encodes the cystine transporter cystinosin and leads to lysosomal cystine accumulation in all the body. In addition to proximal tubular cells, cystinosis also affects the glomerulus since podocytes are lost into urine leading to proteinuria and kidney failure. Cysteamine, the current treatment, decrease cystine accumulation but does not reverse proximal tubular injury (renal Fanconi Syndrome) neither glomerular injury. These evidences suggest that different mechanisms are involved and further studies are necessary to understand the disease in order to develop new therapeutic options. Material and methods: Immortalized patient-derived cystinosis and healthy podocytes were used and the results were validated in our inhouse developed cystinosis zebrafish model. To study the altered metabolic pathways, metabolomic analysis (LC-MS), flow cytometry, RTqPCR, western blot, chemical and redox-sensing fluorescent probes were used. Results: Cystinotic podocytes present a peculiar cellular metabolism, characterized by impaired glycolytic and TCA cycle, increased ROS levels and cell detachment. Interestingly, the latter can be rescued in vitro and in vivo with targeted treatment. Conclusions: An impaired metabolism is a critical feature in podocytes and it elucidates the importance to investigate more targeted therapies in combination with the standard of care cysteamine.",1.0,disease,True

1217,"Introduction: Bartter syndrome is an inherited tubulopathy that presents in infancy or childhood with metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia and normal blood pressure. There are 4 types of Bartter syndrome, with types I, II and IV being more severe, and type III (classic form) being a milder form with a variable presentation, sometimes mimicking other tubulopathies. Therefore, Bartter syndrome should be a permanent differential diagnosis in children with various tublopathies. Material and methods: Case report. Results: We report a case of a 10-year-old boy who was followed by a pediatric nephrologyst from infancy because of incomplete diabetes insipidus. During that time his electrolytes and blood pressure were normal. At the age of 7 hypercalciuria and hyperreninemia were noted for the first time, as well as hyperparathyroidism and osteopenia. Serial renal ultrasounds were normal. Later on, hypokalemia was also noted. His diagnose was then subjected to reevaluation. Because of severe hypercalciuria, CT urography was done and revealed multiple urolites. Genetic analysis was then finally preformed (Blueprint Nephrolitiasis panel with 35 genes) identifying a novel hemizygous frameshift variant c.38_59delinsAGTCAC, p. (Gly13Glufs*22) and a heterozygous deletion chr1:g.16351202_16372237del which encompasses exons of both CLCNKB and CLCKNA genes. The diagnosis of Bartter syndrome was thereby confirmed. Conclusions: Type III Bartter syndrome (classic Bartter syndrome) has a very variable presentation, sometimes overlapping with other tubulopathies. It is caused by loss-of-function mutations in CLCNKB gene encoding the voltage-gated chloride channel CICKb, which is expressed in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henli, but also in the distal convulated tubule, possibly explaining the variable features. While recognizing atypical presentations is still the first step towards the correct diagnosis, modern targeted clinical panels ease the way. Discovering novel mutations is important because of better understanding of molecular mechanisms as well as targeted treatment for the individual patient.",1.0,Case,True

1262,"Introduction: Urolithiasis is defined as the pathological entity in which calculi are formed within the urinary tract, opposed to nephrocalcinosis, which occurs secondary to calcium deposition within the renal parenchyma. We aimed to analyze the cases of pediatric urolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis in which genetic testing has been performed within the last year in our department. Material and methods: Next generation sequence technology in an accredited clinical laboratory was performed in selected cases of pediatric urolithiasis. The criteria for patient selections were at least one of the following: young age at diagnosis, bilateral calculi, family history or recurrence of the disease. A number of 28 cases were analyzed after obtaining the informed consent for participating in this study. Results: We had a number of 28 subjects enrolled in this study; of these, 69.7% (17) were males. The mean age of our patients was 6.51 years (range from 6 months to 17 years). Positive analysis was identified in 57.1% (16) of cases. No statistically significant correlation was found between age at diagnosis and positive genetic finding. However, a statistically significant correlation was made between positive family history and positive genetic finding (p-0.03, Pearson correlation).No statistically significant correlation has been found between the site of nephrolithiasis (unilateral or bilateral) and the rate of positive findings. Conclusions: Our study included more male patients, consistent with the literature supporting male gender to be a risk factor for nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis. Children with positive family history of urolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis should undergo genetic testing for identifying the cause. Although our study did not statistically correlate young age and bilateral nephrolithiasis with gene pathogenic variants, we still recommend genetic testing in these cases.",1.0,case,True

Material and methods: This is a retrospective review on the kidney outcome of children admitted for AKI and survived after hospital discharge from January 2018 to December 2021 at the University Hospital of Kinshasa. The main outcome parameters were proteinuria by dipstick ( +1), albuminuria (uACR  30 mg/g), decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFRcr < 60ml/min/1.73m²). CKD was defined as the presence of albuminuria and/or decreased eGFRcr for more than three months. Results: From January 2018 to December 2021, 218 children (126 boys and 92 girls) were admitted for AKI. The median age was 7 years (1.5 months-16 years). The leading causes of AKI were severe malaria (95/ 218; 43.6%), sepsis (41/218; 18.8%), and HUS (38/218; 17.4%). Dialysis was indicated and performed in 148 of 218 (67.9%). At the discharge, 180/218 (82.6%) recovered efficient diuresis and 40 (18.3%) died probably due to a late transfer. Out of 180 children, only 71 (39.4%) returned for follow-up. There were 26, 9, 11 and 12 children who returned for follow-up at 3, 6, 9, 12 months after the discharge, respectively. CKD was found in 2/71 children (2.8%).

Recent reviews report of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) flare-up presenting as gross hematuria, following COVID-19 vaccination in adult patients. However, evidence of de novo or flare up GN in pediatric patients is lacking, and, to date, there are only few case reports that includes children and adolescents. Material and methods: We evaluated characteristics and clinical outcomes of 3 patients who had a new onset gross hematuria following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination and provide a brief literature review of pediatric cases of GN after vaccine. Results: In this case series we report 3 cases of new onset macroscopic hematuria post-COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. In particular one patient showed a severe IgAN with gross hematuria, proteinuria and decreased renal function within few days after third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions: mRNA COVID-19 vaccine appeared to relate to de novo or relapsing GN in some individuals but the mechanism by which COVID19 vaccination is associated with GN flares is still unclear. Pediatricians lack data to advise patients about the chance of relapse of GN after COVID19 vaccination and the current recommendation is based on case reports and clinical experience. The risk and severity of de novo or relapsing GN after COVID-19 vaccine is not fully understood and this can be challenging during vaccination counselling. Further research is required to understand the relation between COVID-19 vaccination and GN which can provide a more scientific basis for patient counselling, guidance in risk stratification and monitoring for relapse.",1.0,case,True

1277,"Introduction: Childhood hypertension is affecting around 2 to 4% of the paediatric population, where 90% of the Western cases is caused by renal impairment. ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB's) are most frequently prescribed for blood pressure reduction. Both therapeutics are currently being used off-label, despite being available for over three decades. The aim of this study is to retrospectively summarize and to compare findings of conducted pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies investigating all drugs of the ACE-I and ARB's classes, including a potential recommendation for improved study design. Material and methods: This review focused on the clinical trials investigating PK and PD properties of ACE-I and ARB's. 60 studies were selected, including 19 randomized controlled trials. Analysis was conducted with a focus on trial design and endpoints, i.e. safety and efficacy. Results: Between ACE-I and ARB's, geographical location, drug intake and formulations were comparable. Study population differed, for example studies on ARB's focused on both primary and secondary hypertension, where studies on ACE-I focused on secondary hypertension. Sampling regimens varied, where studies investigating the PK of ARB's were frequently based on single dosing at non-steady state. For both classes, low reporting of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (23.3%) and the exclusion of participants with an eGFR under 30 was apparent. Around 90% of the individual reportings using ACE-I achieved an antihypertensive effects of  6 mmHg. ACE-I were generally well tolerated when considering safety parameters and serious adverse events. Limited studies investigated the long-term effects of ACE-I and ARB's on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Conclusions: Standardization of methodology and reporting of results is imperative for PKPD studies, to allow a better comparison of results and to aim towards appropriate labelling. Inclusion across and stratification for age categories and eGFR ranges is recommended.",1.0,case,True

1287,"Introduction: Chronic kidney disease is a recognised complication of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) Vasculitis (previously Henoch Schonlein Purpura, HSP). The exact pathophysiology of this disease remains largely unknown and identifying urinary inflammatory markers could aid identification of targets for earlier diagnosis and/or treatment. The aim of this pilot study was to conduct a large protein panel evaluation of urine samples in children with IgA Vasculitis to discover proteins associated with nephritis. Material and methods: Paediatric patients with IgAV and healthy controls (HC) were recruited as part of the IgA Vasculitis Study (Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, REC 17/NE/0390). Patients with a diagnosis of IgAV were grouped into those with nephritis (IgAVN) and those without (IgAVwoN). Nephritis was defined as a urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) >30 mg/mmol. Determination of relative levels of 126 proteins (encompassing inflammatory cytokines and known markers of kidney inflammation) was performed using commercially available proteome profiler array kits (Human Kidney Biomarker and Human XL Cytokine kits, R&D System Ltd). ImageJ software was used for the pixel density analysis and data was normalised to control points, volume of urine and urinary creatinine. Statistical analysis was performed using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 software. Results: 11 children were included in this study (HC n,""3, IgAVN n"",""4, IgAVwoN n"",""4). Median age was 7.6 years [4.0-13.44] and male:female ratio was 1.2:1. For IgAVN, median UACR was 542.2mg/mmol [110.42,357.37]. Multivariate analysis identified 28 proteins which were significantly different when comparing IgAVN to IgAwoN and HC; 13 proteins were also significantly different between IgAwoN and HC. There was no difference between all IgAV and HC. Conclusions: This data has identified key urinary proteins that provide insight into the pathophysiology of IgAVN. The identified proteins include components of the complement pathway, CXCR pathway and RAAS system. Further analysis is required to validate these findings.""",1.0,disease,True

The first pediatric KT was introduced in 1964. in Pittsburgh, and the first pediatric KT in our Center was performed in 1982. to a 12 -year old boy with nephrotic syndrome. Methods: This is a retrospective, descriptive study. Results: In 40 years (1982-2022), 148 children have been followed at UHC Zagreb after KT. Out of this number, 82,4% were performed in Croatia. There were more kidney transplants from deceased than from living donors (67.5% versus 32.4%), with 13.5% being preemptive. The majority of transplanted children (42.5%) had congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract as their primary disease, while other common causes of ESRD included glomerulonephritis (14,8%), FSGS (12.2%), nephronophthisis (5.4%), congenital nephrotic syndrome (3.3%), polycystic kidney disease (3.3%), IgA nephropathy (2,7%), and Alport syndrome (2.7%). Most of the patients (65.5%) were 6 - 15 years old, and 58% were male. Results: It was observed that one- year graft survival rates were 69% (1982 to 1990), 95% (1990-2000), 92.3% (2000-2010), 91.4% (20102020), while five- year graft survival rates were 53.8% (1982 to 1990), 76,2% (1990-2000), 81.5% (2000-2010), 85.7% (2010-2020). Ten- year patient survival rates were 85% (1982 to 2000), and 96.1% (2000-2020). Conclusion Outcomes after pediatric KT in Croatia have been markedly improved after the first decade, mainly due to greater surgical experience, improved immunosuppression and donor selection criteria. Patient survival and 5- year graft survival rates have dramatically improved after the first decade and continued to improve thereafter. One- year graft survival has remained the same since the 1990s. Despite the better outcomes following initial transplantation, many challenges such as newer immunosuppressive agents with optimal balance, improved surgical techniques and better antiviral prophylaxis, remain to be implemented in the years to come.",1.0,disease,True

The aims of this study were to examine the prevalence of sleep disturbances and determine factors related to poor sleep in adolescents with SLE. Material and methods: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Patient Questionnaire of Adolescents (PHQA) were administered to children aged 13-18 years with SLE to evaluate sleep quality and depression, respectively. Participants with PSQI5 were considered to be poor sleepers. Participants with PHQA5 were considered to be at risk of depression. Variables which were significantly different between good sleepers and poor sleepers were used to run univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. Results: Fifty-seven patients (46 females, 81%) with a median age (interquartile range) of 15 years (13.5-17) and a median disease duration of 44 months (17.8-69) were enrolled. The median body mass index (BMI) was 22.6 kg/m2 (18.6-26.2), and 22 participants (38.6%) were overweight (BMI>23 kg/m2). All participants received daily prednisolone with a median dose of 10 mg (5-30). The median PSQI was 4 (2-5). Eighteen participants (31.6%) were poor sleepers. The median PHQA was 3 (1-7). Eighteen participants (31.6%) were at risk of depression. Five factors significantly different between poor sleepers and good sleepers, namely age >14 years (middle vs. early adolescent), being overweight, daily prednisolone >7.5 mg (high vs. low daily prednisolone dose), PHQA score, and monthly household income <600 US dollars (lower vs. higher income), and were included in a multivariate model.

A kidney transplant was performed at the age of eight, complicated by early graft loss. The further course was characterized by many CKD related comorbidities including hypertension Results: In December 2020 she had a COVID-19 infection with pneumonia and encephalopathy. In the following months she developed suppurative hidradenitis, partially improved after adalimumab treatment.

Material and methods: Office and ABPM measures of cases who were also evaluated for LVH were included in the study. According to office BPs(OBPs), mean ambulatory SBP or DBPs(MABPs), and SBP or DBP loads(BPLs), ambulatory BPs were classified as normal (NT;N OBPs, MABPs<95p, BPLs<25%), white coat hypertension (WCHT;OBPs95p, MABPs<95p, BPLs<25%), prehypertension (PreHT;OBP90p, MABPs<95p, BPLs25%), masked hypertension (MHT;OBP<95p, MABPs>95p, BPLs25%), and ambulatory hypertension (AHT;OBP>95p, MABPs>95p, BPLs25%). Unclassified cases (UC1) with N OBPs, MABPs<95p, but BPLs25% and those (UC2) with OBPs95p, MABPs<95p, and BPLs25% were defined. LVMI, LVMI/95p values and LVH ratios were compared between NT, UC1 and MHT groups and between WCHT, UC2 and AHT groups. Results: A total of 533 cases were included. There were 52 cases in the NT, 47 cases in UC1, 50 cases in MHT, 79 cases in WCHT, 104 cases in UC2, and 165 cases in AHT group. Cases in MHT group were older than those of the NT and UC1 groups. Gender, BMI, BMI SDS, LVMI, LVMI/95p values were similar between the NT, UC1 and MHT cases and between WCHT, UC2 and AHT cases. LVH in MHT was significantly higher than UC1 and NT groups. LVH was significantly higher in the AHT group compared to WCHT, and similar between WCHT and UC2 groups. Conclusions: This is the first study assessing the importance of unclassified groups in terms of LVH. Being in the UC1 or UC2 groups do not change the status of NT or WCHT. As the only difference between NT and UC1 groups and WCHT and UC2 groups is the BPLs, we may conclude that having BPLs>25% does not contribute to LVH in children.",1.0,clinical,True

1326,"Material and methods: Patients who have undergone acute RRT while weighing less than 15kg with a minimum follow-up period of 6 months were included. Survived patients were examined at the last visit. Results: A total of 80 patients (42 female, 38 male) were included in the study. Among them, 43 patients (53.8%) received hemodialysis (HD) and 37 patients (46.2%) received peritoneal dialysis (PD). The age, height, weight, and body surface area of HD patients were found to be significantly higher than those of PD patients (p<0.001). Most of the patients less than 5 kg (96%) received PD and most of the patients between 10.1-15 kg (88.6%) received HD. At the end of the dialysis process, 41 patients (51.3%) survived. It was determined that the height, weight, and body surface area values of the surviving patients at the beginning of dialysis were higher than those of the deceased patients (p<0.001). In multiple regression analysis, only low weight and vasopressor treatment were found to be negatively associated with survival. Dialysis modality did not affect survival. At the last visit 31 patients could be evaluated. Non-nephrotic proteinuria was found in six (19.3%) of 31 patients (38.8%). Stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD) was diagnosed in three patients (9.6%). Office blood pressure measurement revealed hypertension in one patient. Masked hypertension was detected in one patient with 24-hr ABPM. Conclusions: PD and HD can be used safely, and effectively in patients weighing less than 15 kg.

Material and methods: A 4- year-old girl presented first with pure nephrotic syndrome (NS). Initial biological analysis were not in favor for other renal pathologies. She did not reach remission after 30 days of oral steroids at 60 mg/m2 and she remained resistant to steroid pulses and combined tacrolimus/steroid treatment, to IV cyclosporine, rituximab and to 30 sessions of plasma exchange. Her renal function declined and hemodialysis was started. Bi-nephrectomy was performed as edema were still massive despite CKD stage 5. Ten months later she received an allograft from a deceased donor and idiopathic NS relapsed immediately post transplant. She did not respond to a combination of immunoadsorption (50 sessions), high dose tacrolimus treatment combined with oral high dose steroids and steroid pulses and mycophenolate mofetil. She received obinutuzumab 1g/ 1.73m2 injections weekly for one month and then daratumumab 1g/1.73m2 weekly for one month while IA sessions were continued. Results: CD20 and CD38 were negative and proteinuria started to decrease 7 days after the 1st daratumumab injection and was negative 2 weeks later. We decreased IA sessions over 2 months without proteinuria relapse. 4 months later CD38 positive cells recovered in peripheral blood and nephrotic proteinuria reappeared. We performed a daratumumab and obinutuzumab reinjections leading to INS remission without considerable side effects. Graft function and all standard parameters are normal.

Material and methods: A 1-year-old female presented in a Ukrainian hospital with fever, bloody diarrhea and lethargy. Laboratory investigation revealed anemia (8,7 g/dl), thrombocytopenia (63 10^3 /uL), acute kidney injury (creatinine 0,7 mg/dl) and signs of hemolysis. Urine analysis showed microscopic hematuria (153/pf) and proteinuria (6 g/l). C3 and C4 levels and ADAMTS13 activity were normal. The microbiological VTEC analysis tested negative. After a few days, the patient developed acute myocardial dysfunction and bilateral pneumonia. Laboratory findings showed elevated inflammatory markers, Pro-BNP and DDimers, along with positive IgG SARS-COV2 antibodies, consistent with MIS-c. Afterwards, neurological impairment and myocardial function worsened, leading to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins at dosage of 2 g/kg and heparin. On day 30, the patient was discharged with normal renal function, no significant proteinuria, mild hypertension and left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%. The patient was referred to Bambino Gesù Pediatric Hospital; genetic and functional testing for complement dysregulation was performed and are ongoing. Results: There is a growing interest in the role of complement activation in Sars-CoV2-related endothelial dysfunction and pro-coagulative state. In a series of paediatric renal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) associated with MIS-c or acute SarsCoV-2 infection, higher serum C5b9 was associated with more severe renal damage. Moreover, two HUS patients concomitant to SarsCoV-2 infection responded to eculizumab. Genetic susceptibility for complement dysregulation was reported in an adult series of COVID-19-related renal TMA. Conclusions: These findings postulate the role of COVID-19 as a trigger for complement-driven HUS and suggest the importance of genetic testing in patients with HUS secondary to COVID-19.",1.0,COVID-19,True

1417,"Material and methods: In this example, we want to show the causal relationship between coagulation and the complement in multiorgan system failure. Results: A fourteen-month-old boy with a severe, life-threatening illness was admitted to the intensive care unit due to a sudden onset of fever, hematemesis, hematuria, and bloody diarrhea with a rapid spread of hematoma and generalized edema. The diagnosis of DIC is supported by clinical presentation, elevated aPTT, and decreased antithrombin III with low platelet counts. Plasma fibrinogen was elevated alongside LDH, Ddimers, and hemoglobin, with a decreased haptoglobin and C3, indicating complement consumption. Significantly reduced C1q with negative antiC1q reflects the presence of global complement activation. Massive complement consumption is indicated by decreased factor H, factor I, and factor B with alternative complement activation pathway activity (30%). ADAMTS13 metalloprotease (46%) excludes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Following administration of Eculizumab at the recommended dose on day 10 of illness, the childs general condition soon improved with the cessation of bloody diarrhea. The second occurrence of bloody diarrhea after day 5 was stopped with a subsequent dose of Eculizumab. The most compelling solution to the success of therapy in our patient is DIC with massive complement consumption that can result in sepsis-induced thrombotic microangiopathy. A rapid clinical and laboratory response (increase in platelets and C3) after administration of Eculizumab is consistent with this outcome. Conclusions: Recent animal studies demonstrate the interaction between coagulation disorders, the complement system, and innate immunity during septic progression. Eculizumab therapy has never been used in children in patients with DIC to the best of our knowledge. We cannot recommend the use of Eculizumab in all patients with MOF and DIC. Instead, a personalized approach in patients with massive consumption of complement with short-term use of Eculizumab may be considered a temporary solution to eliminate the life-threatening effect of complement at that time.",1.0,spread,True

Subsequently, 5-fold increase of serum IgG4 was found confirming IgG4-RD. This disease affects predominantly GI system, but kidney involvement previously was described in adults only. Prednisolone 1 mg/kg was initiated and within 7 months the child become symptom-free with completely normal blood tests and GFR 88 ml/min/ 1,73 m2 and normal serum IgG4. The dose was slowly tapered and after 1,5 years after initiation discontinued due to hypertension and growth problem. Control of serum IgG4 brought us to mofetyl mycophenolate initiation and this treatment lasts one year with increase of GFR to 102 ml/ min/1,73 m2. Conclusions: Our observation suggests that IgG4-RD may be the cause of tubulointerstitial kidney damage in children responsive to immunosuppressive treatment. To elaborate optimal strategy multicenter studies are needed.",1.0,disease,True

1432,"Introduction: Secondary pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) is a rare saltwasting syndrome that develops due to transient peripheral resistance to aldosterone. It usually presents with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis in infants. Here, we present eight infant cases who presented with severe hyponatremia and hyperkalemia and were diagnosed with secondary PHA. Material and methods: Data were analyzed retrospectively from patient files. Adrenal precursor, renin and aldosterone values of the cases were standardized according to age and gender. Results: Four of the all cases were boys. Median age was 45 days (990). Severe hyponatremia and hyperkalemia were the common laboratory features of the cases. Median serum sodium and potassium levels were 120.5 meq/L (108-126) and 6 meq/L (5.9-11.7), respectively. Although all cases had normal genital appearance, all of them were evaluated with the presumptive diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. While serum adrenal precursors were normal, renin and aldosterone levels were high, suggesting PHA. All patients underwent urinary ultrasonography. All cases had urinary tract infection and/or urinary tract malformation (Six of them had urinary tract malformation and five of them had urinary tract infection), so they were diagnosed with secondary PHA. After the treatment (hydration and/or antibiotic) serum renin and aldosterone levels of patients were found to be within normal limits. Conclusions: Secondary PHA should be kept in mind in cases of hyponatremia and hyperkalemia in infancy. Although congenital adrenal hyperplasia should be the first diagnosis to be excluded in the presence of concurrent hyponatremia and hyperkalemia in the infantile period, evaluation should also include urinalysis and renal imaging.",1.0,case,True

1436,"Introduction: Circumcision is prevalent worldwide. In Israel, over 90% of men are circumcised. Muslim boys are generally circumcised shortly after birth, and Jewish circmcision is performed on the eighth day of life. Complications are uncommon and are mainly surgical and infectious. Urinary tract obstruction is a rare complication of circumcision. The objective of this retrospective study was to define the incidence of urinary tract obstruction following circumcision in a single tertiary medical center, describe the characteristics of affected babies and review the outcome. Material and methods: Study participants were identified from medical records of all male babies aged 0-30 days presenting at the pediatric emergency department during the years 2000-2020, with serum creatinine levels  1 mg/dl. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from the electronic records.] Results: 8091 male post-circumcision newborn babies were admitted to the pediatric emergency room during the study period, 46 (0.57%) of them had elevated serum creatinine.

1442,"Introduction: Acute lobar nephronia (ALN), also known as acute focal bacterial nephritis, is a suppurative focal form of acute bacterial infection. Computed tomography (CT) is currently recognised as the most sensitive and specific imaging modality to diagnose ALN. Although it has a typical appearance, an objective, measurement-based diagnostic criteria has never been developed so far. Material and methods: Patients followed up with the diagnosis of upper urinary tract infection and clinically indicated for CT were included in the study. The renal parenchymal involvement was defined as low-density areas in the kidney parenchyma on the contrast-enhanced CT scan. According to the morphological characteristics, the radiological diagnosis was categorized as acute pyelonephritis (APN) and ALN. The faint distinction of the hypodense areas from the normal renal parenchyma was accepted as the APN. The sharp distinction of the hypodense areas from the normal renal parenchyma was accepted as the ALN. The other characteristics of the hypodense areas were evaluated, including the site (right kidney/left kidney/bilaterally), the number (solitary/multiple), and the shape (wedge-like/non-wedge-like). For the quantitative analysis to differentiate ALN from the APN, the mean Hounsfield unit (HU) of the hypodense areas and those of adjacent normal kidney parenchyma were calculated on the contrast-enhanced CT scan. To eliminate variations in CT acquisition parameters and contrast material amount among patients, two formulas were used: Normal parenchyma HU - Hypodense area HU (Formul 1 (F1)) and Normal parenchyma HU / Hypodense area HU (Formul 2 F2)) Results: A total of 33 kidney units (15 APN (Group 1), 18 ALN (Group 2)) of 23 patients (18 ALN, 5 APN) were evaluated. Demographic and clinical results of the cases are shown in Table 1. When APN and ALN lesion HUs were evaluated, there was no difference between lesions and normal parenchyma, whereas F1 and F2 were different between both groups (p,""0.001 and p<0.001, respectively) (Table 2) In the ROC analysis performed to predict that the lesion is ALN on CT, F1 had 83% sensitivity and 80% specificity for  49.5, while F2  1.57 had 89% sensitivity and 80% specificity.

We aimed to compare the patients with VUR staged 3 or more according to type of parenchymal damage. Material and methods: We analysed the records of the children who were followed-up in our center between 2010-2020 with primary VUR staged-3 (moderate) or 4-5 (severe). They were grouped as CPD, APD and normal parenchyma (NP). Results: The study included 149 patients and 218 renal reflux units (RRU). The APD, CPD, NP groups included 42, 40, 67 patients and 48, 40, 130 RRUs, respectively. The APD had female predominancy (73.8%), while the CPD had male predominancy (72.5%) (p<0.001). The age of diagnosis was significantly higher in the APD (p<0.001). The diagnosis was coincidental in CPD, while mostly after urinary tract infection (UTI) in APD and NP groups (p<0.001). Severe VUR mostly diagnosed by antenatal hydronephrosis in CPD and NP groups, and by UTI in APD group (p,""0.002). Getting UTI 2 times before diagnosis was most common in APD group, while no UTI was found before diagnosis at a rate of 67.5% in CPD (p<0.001). The main treatment modality for moderate VUR was continuous antibiotics prophylaxis (CAP) in NP, endoscopic subureteric transurethral injection in APD, and ureteroneocystostomy in CPD groups (p<0.001). Severe VUR patients were mostly followed up with CAP in the NP group and with surgical treatment in the APD and CPD groups (p<0.001). Moderate VUR patients did not have UTI under CAP in the NP, APD and CPD groups by the rate of 95.7%, 62.5% and 66.7%, respectively (p"",0.017). Conclusions: Moderate and severe VUR will present with normal or damaged renal parenchyma.

1479,"Introduction: Primary steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is thought to have either genetic or immune-mediated aetiology. Children with a genetic cause of SRNS tend to not respond to immunosuppression and usually progress to chronic kidney failure in childhood. Some forms of genetic SRNS allow for targeted therapies. Knowing which children to screen for genetic causes can be difficult. Numerous studies have described the prevalence of genetic causes of primary SRNS to be between 30-40%, but their cohorts include children with congenital and infantile NS and familial cases. We aimed to look at the prevalence of a Mendelian cause for children 1-year of age or older with sporadic SRNS. Material and methods: Retrospective electronic patient record analysis of all children with sporadic SRNS who presented at our centre over the last 15 years was undertaken. All statistical analysis were performed using SPSS Version 27. Results: Of the 49 children who met the inclusion criteria, 5 (10%) had causative variants identified, predominantly in NPHS2. None responded to immunosuppression. Of the 44 (90%) who had no genetic cause identified, 33 (75%) had complete or partial remission after commencing second-line immunosuppression and 67% of these had eGFR >90 ml/ min/1.73m2 at last clinical follow-up. Of the children who did not respond to immunosuppression, 64% progressed to kidney failure. Conclusions: Those with identified genetic cause were significantly (p, 0.003) less likely to respond to immunosuppression and more likely (p,0.026) to progress to chronic kidney disease.

Material and methods: 11 patients were included in this study (54% boys), with BW 5.8 - 12 kg and age 0.71 - 4.9 years (Median: 2.1 years). 37% had a diagnosis of congenital nephrotic syndrome, 36% had corticosteroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, 18% had renal hypoplasia/dysplasia and 9% hyperoxaluria. 40% of the patients had residual renal function. All patients were treated with at least 3 sessions of haemodialysis per week lasting 4-5 hours. Results: The main problem was vascular access. All patients had a permanent double lumen jugular vein catheter. The mean catheter survival time was 31.5 months (8.8-53.1). Each patient had approximately 3 different catheter insertions (0.46/patient/year). The main indications for catheter removal were mechanical problems (90%) and infections (10%) with most common bacteria isolated Staph. Aureus and Staph. Epidermidis. The mean number of catheter related infections was 0.35/ patient/year (0-1.21). Other complications included hemodynamic instability during hemodialysis, hyperkalemia, seizures, allergic reactions, extracorporeal circuit thrombosis. In all children weight and height z scores improved (50% of the patients were on growth hormone treatment). During the follow up period, 2 patients (18%) received a renal transplant, 7 patients (64%) continue on hemodialysis and 2 patients (18%) changed dialysis mode due to vascular access problems. Conclusions: Haemodialysis in experienced centres is safe for children with BW<12 kg. Vascular access problem is the main complication but longevity can be prolonged with good line care.",1.0,,True

She developed severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia needing steroids and diuretics for the first months of life. Our patient has horseshoe kidney and since the first months of life her renal ultrasounds have shown bilateral nephrocalcinosis with consequent pyelectasia. Bone densitometry detected osteopenia, worsening at the following checks. Laboratory tests revealed hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, in the presence of low values of PTH and of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. To the contrary, calcitriol was highly increased and the patient showed hypersensitivity to the treatment with vitamin D. Genetic testing for CYP24A1 mutations resulted negative. Over time laboratory tests have shown a trend to low levels of phosphataemia and incostant phosphate reabsorption. Nephrocalcinosis has been significant and the patient underwent lithotripsy at the age of ten. The genetic testing was then widened with clinical exome sequencing. Results: Clinical exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous mutations c.1304delG and novel c.986_1000del in SLC34A3 gene which encodes the sodium-phosphate cotransporter NaPi2a.

1495,"Introduction: Post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) is the most common and benign hypocomplementemic nephritis in children. However, cases of atypical PIGN (aPIGN) with prolonged C3 consumption and/or atypical membranoproliferative (MPGN) pattern have been reported (Sethi, 2013). In this setting, C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) is the main differential diagnosis. Dysregulation of alternative complement pathway is a well-known pathogenetic mechanism of C3G. However, similar alterations have been reported even in aPIGN, suggesting a disease spectrum. Our case report is paradigmatic of this concept. Material and methods: A 5-year-old child presented persistent macrohematuria since 4 weeks earlier, during an upper airways infection. Blood pressure was normal, blood tests showed normal renal function, C3 hypocomplementemia, and urinary protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) of 1.7 mg/mg. C4, immunoglobulin and autoantibodies were normal: PIGN was suspected. At 6 weeks, macrohematuria persisted, C3 was still low and UPCR was 2 mg/mg. Kidney biopsy was performed. Results: Histological picture showed a light microscopy MPGN pattern and isolated C3 immunofluorescence compatible with C3G. By electron microscopy, electron dense deposits were mainly mesangial and subendothelial, but also intramembranous, as seen in dense deposit disease. Moreover, numerous humps were present. C3 glomerulonephritis was diagnosed. Therapy with oral prednisone and ramipril was started and led to rapid normalization both of UPCR (in 2 weeks) and of C3 levels (in 4 weeks). Conclusions: In our case, acute clinical course (in total 10-12 weeks from onset to remission) with rapid response to prednisone and numerous humps suggest a PIGN diagnosis, while intrainfectious macrohematuria, prolonged C3 reduction, MPGN pattern with heterogeneous distribution of electron dense deposits, especially intramembranous, suggest C3G. This clinical and histological picture of true atypical PIGN show that, in some cases, a distinction between PIGN and C3G is difficult and, probably, a spectrum of forms, between the purely acute self-limiting and the chronic forms, exists.",1.0,infectious,True

We also described and compared the duration of dialysis, causes of kidney failure, HLA, EBV and CMV matching, donor characteristics and ischemia times in the 2 groups (Mean±SD). Results: 852 and 191 patients were included in the DD and the LD groups, respectively. The age at transplantation was slightly lower in DD group: 11.1±5.0 vs 12.0±4.4 years (p,0.01).

She was born premature with unremarkable gestation. Shortly after birth she developed lower extremities edemas, oligury and hyponatremia. From the second day of her life increased blood pressure was measured. Renal ultrasound revealed large kidneys with many small cysts in parenchyma while echocardiogram indicated hypertrophy of interventricular heart septum. Due to involvement of various organ systems at the age of 11 months comprehensive genetic testing was performed. Sequence analysis using the Blueprint Genetics (BpG) Whole Exome Plus identified a heterozygous nonsense variant PKHD1 c.9319C>T, p.(Arg3107*), a heterozygous missense variant PKHD1 c.4882C>G, p.(Pro1628Ala), and a heterozygous missense variant PTPN11 c.178G>A, p.(Gly60Ser). The two former variants are classified as pathogenic and the latter as likely pathogenic. Conclusions: While mutations in PKHD1 gene are related to defects in cilia-mediated signaling activity resulting in cyst formation and recessive form of PKD, PTPN11 muatations have been associated with dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway recognized as the molecular cause underlying a group of clinically related developmental disorders with features including reduced growth, facial dysmorphism, cardiac defects, ectodermal anomalies, variable cognitive deficits, and susceptibility to certain malignancies.

1563,"Introduction: Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) affects 1-3 per 100.000 children per year. Steroids are used as first-line therapy and remission is achieved in up to 85 %. 80% of the children experience at least one relapse. For patients with frequently relapsing NS cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment is recommended aiming for complete remission. CsA therapy is effective but the benefical effects of CsA are often accompanied by acute and chronic CsA nephrotoxicity, hypertension, hypertrichosis and gingival overgrowth. Aim of this study is to analyze the effects of long-term CsA treatment in children with NS. Material and methods: We performed a retrospective study in children (<18 years) with NS treated with CsA to control frequent relapsing nephrotic syndrome, steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome and steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome in our clinic from 2007 to 2020. Possible patients were identified by searching our database of children with nephrotic syndrome who fulfilled the above criteria. For statistical analysis we used a Bayesian mixed model approach. Results: A total of 75 patients (34% female) were enrolled in the study. At the beginning of treatment with CsA the median age was 6 years [first quartile 3.4; third quartile 10.3], serum creatinine was 35 mol/l [27; 44] and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, bedside formula by Schwartz) was 130 ml/min/1,73m2 [113; 146]. Duration of treatment with CsA was 4.5 years [2.7; 8.0]. Preliminary data analysis showed that either treatment duration or cumulated CsA dose or cumulated trough levels are able to predict course of eGFR. Conclusions: Children with NS that are treated with CsA for a long period of time a decrease in eGFR can be observed. Other factors like gender, age and clinical course of NS have no influence.

1567,"Introduction: Secondary pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) is a rare saltwasting syndrome that develops due to transient peripheral resistance to aldosterone. It usually presents with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis in infants. Here, we present eight infant cases who presented with severe hyponatremia and hyperkalemia and were diagnosed with secondary PHA. Material and methods: Data were analyzed retrospectively from patient files. Adrenal precursor, renin and aldosterone values of the cases were standardized according to age and gender. Results: Severe hyponatremia and hyperkalemia were the common laboratory features of the cases. Although all cases had normal genital appearance, all of them were evaluated with the presumptive diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. While serum adrenal precursors were normal, renin and aldosterone levels were high, suggesting PHA. Urinary ultrasonography was performed in all cases. Six of them had urinary tract malformations and urinary tract infections, so they were diagnosed with secondary PHA. After the treatment (hydration and/or antibiotic) serum renin and aldosterone levels of patients were found to be within normal limits.

1573,"Introduction: Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XPN) is a rare presentation of severe chronic pyelonephritis characterised by renal parenchymal destruction by granulomatous tissue, inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis. The possible underlying mechanism involves urinary tract obstruction due to congenital anomalies, nephrolithiasis and recurrent urinary infection, resulting in unspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, abdominal mass, growth and weight retardation with persistent anemia, leucocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), bacteriuria and pyuria. Therefore, the range of possible differential diagnosis is wide. Material and methods: Case report Results: The presented patient was born from an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. He first came to our attention at the age of 6 months due to acute cystopyelonefritis. Subsequently, left-sided hydroureteronephrosis (without vesicoureteral reflux), lymphadenopathy, severe anemia, elevated ESR and liver enzymes, as well as hypergammaglobulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia were noted. Other immune mediated, infectious, metabolic and malignant conditions were excluded by thorough diagnostic workup, including bone marrow analysis and whole exome sequencing. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography revealed unilateral nephrocalcinosis, and dynamic renal scintigraphy afunction of the left enlarged kidney. Despite antibiotic therapy, recurrent sterile pyuria with ongoing inflammation was present, necessitating a short course of glucocorticoids which led to gradual improvement of laboratory findings. Finally, left nephrectomy was performed with pathohistological finding suggestive of XPN. Conclusions: Regardless of diligent diagnostic workup, the precise mechanisms leading to XPN and intense immune reaction in our patient remains inconclusive. The literature data suggest that it might be a result of a macrophage defect in microbial processing, although no other signs of this process were present in the presented patient. Since this condition is very rarely present in children, especially infants, increased reporting of such challenging cases might increase the awareness, alleviate diagnostic dilemmas and steer the most appropriate treatment options.",1.0,Case,True

1578,"Introduction: Dysfunctional voiding may lead to chronic kidney disease in some patients. Prognostic criteria to predict kidney injury are not defined. The aim of this study is to assess the clinical course of patients with dysfunctional voiding to determine possible differences in patients with kidney injury. Material and methods: Medical records of 19 patients with dysfunctional voiding followed in our hospital were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with anatomic and neuropathic disorders were excluded. Results: This study included 19 patients (F/M:13/6) with dysfunctional voiding. The mean age at diagnosis was 72±52 months, and the follow-up period was 51±41 months. 16 of 19 patients presented with both daytime and night-time urinary incontinence, 1 patient only had enuresis. Two patients were continent, presented only with urinary tract infection (UTI). At the time of diagnosis, 15 patients had UTI and 13 patients had recurrent UTI in the follow-up. Thirteen (68.4%) of 18 patients to who DMSA was performed had scars in the first scan. 5 of the patients had vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and one of them had no scars on DMSA. There were two patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (Stage IIIAand IIIB), and these 2 patients did not have VUR. Asignificant amount of residual urine was found in 13 of the patients in repetitive evaluations according to ICCS criteria. When the admission symptoms and uroflow examinations are evaluated; it was observed that recurrent UTI at the time of admission was the only independent risk factor for the development of CKD (p,0.016). Conclusions: The first complaint in patients with bladder and bowel dysfunction is usually urinary incontinence. Different parameters are used to predict upper tract injury in different uropathies. Patients with VUR and scars in DMSA are alerting findings in dysfunctional voiding. Recurrent UTI was observed as the only independent risk factor for CKD in our study.",1.0,disease,True

Among acute immune-mediated renal diseases is tubulo-interstitial nephritis (TIN), which can be associated to uveitis in TINU syndrome. Some authors have reported the concurrence of TINU syndrome and IgAN in adults. Only one case is described in children, however the diagnosis of IgAN preceded that of TINU by one year. Material and methods: In this work we describe the case of a girl who presented histological features of both TINU and IgAN at the time of the diagnosis.

The clinical presentation was therefore indicative of acute TIN. Ophthalmological evaluation was performed, with finding of bilateral anterior uveitis, configuring a diagnosis of TINU. Renal histology confirmed the clinical hypothesis of TINU, however optical microscopy and immunofluorescence also showed IgA deposit in the mesangium and the presence of a fibro-cellular crescent, typical features of IgAN. A two months therapy with oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/daily was started with normalization of renal function and urine tests at 1 month's follow-up. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first pediatric case with a simultaneous diagnosis of two immune-mediated renal pathologies, both triggered by an infectious event. Our case presented with clinical and laboratory characteristics compatible with TINU syndrome, with an excellent response to the oral corticosteroid; therefore it is conceivable that the IgAN a pre-existing subclinical condition.",1.0,clinical,True

1588,"Introduction: Whether preterm birth is associated with cardiac conduction or repolarization abnormalities in later life is still poorly explored, with conflicting data on QTc prolongation in former extreme low birth weight (ELBW, <1000 g) infants. Former preterms are known to have a poorer cardiovascular outcome compared to their term born peers and QTc is often used to decide whether children are fit to receive certain drugs. Material and methods: Twelve lead electrocardiograms (ECG) at rest, collected in the PREMATurity as predictor of children's Cardiovascular and renal Health (PREMATCH) study in former ELBW cases and term controls during pre-adolescence (8-14 years) were analyzed on eGFR (cystatin C) and corrected QT time (QTc, Bazett) and QT dispersion (QTd). ECG findings were compared between groups (Mann -Whitney), and associations with clinical and biochemical findings were explored (Spearman). In ELBW cases, associations between QTc and perinatal characteristics (at birth, neonatal stay) were explored (Mann -Whitney, Spearman). Results: As expected, former preterms scored lower on eGFR compared to the control group (94 vs. 107 ml/min/1.73m2), but QTc and QTd were similar between 93 ELBW cases and 87 controls [409 (range 360-465) versus 409 (337-460); 40 (0-100) versus 39 (0-110)] ms. Age, height, weight, or body mass index were not associated with the QTc interval, while female sex (median difference 11.4 ms) and lower potassium (r ,"" -0.26) were associated with longer QTc interval. We could not observe any significant association between QTc interval and perinatal characteristics. Conclusions: Although former preterms had a lower eGFR, there were no differences in QTc or QTd between ELBW and term controls in ECGs at rest in pre-adolescents. As such, QTc risk for medicines should not be handled differently in former preterms.""",1.0,case,True

1593,"Introduction: Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare complement-mediated disease, rarely combined with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Some authors believe that leukemia in children is a rare but possible risk for the occurrence of thrombotic microangiopathies. Material and methods: We present a girl with aHUS who responded well to maintenance therapy for pre-B ALL (BFM ALL IC-2009 protocol). In this child, Eculizumab was administered at a very early stage of aHUS and achieved a rapid response to therapy. Results: Common and additional hemolysis parameters followed up decreases in hemolysis: Reticulocyte Production Index (RPI) and RPI adjusted for age (RPI/A) to platelet ratio, as well as aspartateaminotransferase-platelet ratio index (APRI). RPI and RPI/A to platelet ratio are markers of bone marrow response to anemia and hemolysis, primarily serving as a marker of red blood cell vs. platelet recovery. APRI/d-dimer with platelet relationship could be helpful to mark the exact recovery point of aHUS patients and a prognostic marker of Eculizumab treatment success. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the seventh case of HUS / aHUS on maintenance therapy and the first with clearly documented use of Eculizumab. A systematic review of the literature found 14 out of 312 similar articles; five children had aHUS before the onset of ALL and two simultaneously. No clinical recurrences of ALL or aHUS during Eculizumab treatment or residual renal impairment were observed during the one-year follow-up. Such a small number of published cases poses a limitation to the conclusion that both diseases have a mutual genetic background trigger.

1603,"Introduction: Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is a common developmental anomaly of kidney characterized by multiple non-communicating cysts and non-functioning dysplastic parenchyma. It is usually asymptomatic, incidental diagnosis is common if not detected antenatally. Material and methods: The exact mechanism of disrupted nephrogenesis is unknown. However, some of the mutations and chromosomal abnormalities have been identified in this regard. Results: A full term 3.4 kg female baby was born to a 31 year-old mother via caesarean section. There was no history of teratogen exposure, maternal disease, or medication. The parents had non-consanguineous marriage. On prenatal follow-up, multiple cystic lesions in the right kidney were reported, the largest of which was 80*127 mm. Baby cried immediately at birth and Apgar score was 5/8. On physical examination, she had abdominal distension with palpable mass. Also, she had sacral dimple and hairy patch. Abdominal ultrasonography showed right kidney with massive cystic lesions filling the whole abdomen, and hyperechogenic left kidney with grade 2 hydronephrosis. Sacral ultrasonography was normal. Urine output was normal (3 cc/kg/hour). While postnatal serum creatinine (SCr) level was 1,2 mg/dL in the first 24 hours, it increased to 1,6 mg/dl after 48 hours. Voiding cystoureterogram showed no vesicoureteral-reflux. On clinical follow-up, she couldn't tolerate feeding per oral or nasogastric tube due to abdominal distension. Therefore, nephrectomy was performed. After the procedure, she well-tolerated feeding and discharged. After one month, SCr level decreased to 0.8 mg/dl. Anteroposterior diameter of left renal pelvis regressed from 18 mm to 13 mm. Pathologic examination of the right kidney supported the diagnosis of MCDK. Genetic analysis showed 17q12 deletion. Conclusions: ""17q12 microdeletion syndrome"" is an autosomal dominant inherited chromosomal anomaly including HNF1B gene region.

1608,"Introduction: Secondary hyperoxaluria may be due to increased dietary intake of oxalate/oxalate precursors, decreased calcium intake or intestinal malabsorption. In pediatrics, primary genetic forms (PH) are the most frequent, but in adults, almost half cases of hyperoxaluria have a nutritional origin. Material and methods: We report on a 5-year-old girl, referred to our tertiary care for hyperoxaluria. She was a single child born from nonconsanguineous parents without familial renal history. She displayed cloudy urines in infancy; renal ultrasounds found multiple bilateral lithiasis. A first evaluation was performed, finding high levels of urinary oxalate/creatinine ratio (Ox/creatU), between 120-304 mol/mmol (N 17-100). Genetic analysis ruled out PH 1, 2 and 3. A thorough evaluation was then performed because of the discrepancy between overt hyperoxaluria and negative genetic testing. The patient also had multiple food allergies (including cow's milk protein). A detailed nutritional assessment found a low-calcium diet, with only 340 mg of nutritional calcium per day (as opposed to the recommended 800 mg for age), only of vegetal origin (thus of lower efficiency for calcium intestinal absorption). She did not receive calcium supplementation. Biochemical evaluation found normal renal function, and confirmed hyperoxaluria (Ox/creatU 132) with normal glycolate, as well as normal calcium, phosphate, PTH and ALP levels but increased 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D (350 pmol/L, N <200) and hypocalciuria (<0,11 mmol/L). Results: Dietician advice were given, aiming at normal calcium intake. Six months later, both 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D and Ox/creatU normalized (86 mol/mmol and 157 pmol/L, respectively), as well as renal ultrasounds. Conclusions: Enteric hyperoxaluria is common in adults, but less frequent in children. Low calcium intake in children may be seen more frequently, because of increased prevalence of cow's milk allergy, avoidance of dairy products and vegan diets. A thorough dietetic assessment is crucial in the evaluation of pediatric nephrolithiasis.",1.0,case,True

As opposite, ,,cold"" IgG antibody mediated anemia occurs in only 1% of autoimmune hemolytic anemias in children. Material and methods: We present a 2.5-year-old, otherwise healthy girl who initially came to our attention because of pallor and dark urine. Two weeks earlier she had symptoms suggestive of both upper respiratory and urinary tract infection which was treated with wide-spectrum antibiotics and led to the complete resolution of symptoms. Two weeks later she developed fever with joint pain, headache and macrohaematuria. A wide differential diagnosis was considered, including hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Results: Her laboratory findings showed hemolytic anemia (Hgb 92), mild thrombocytopenia (Trc 145), normal renal function and mild hyperlipidemia with only a few erythrocytes in the urine sediment. As a part of workup, the screening for antibodies against red blood cells was performed, revealing positive direct (DAT) and negative indirect (IAT) antiglobulin test. Finally, more specific test revealed positive ,,cold"" biphasic IgG anti P1 antibodies which are patognomonic for paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. Conclusions: Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (Donath-Landsteiner anemia) is a form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia characterised with abrupt onset of hemolytic anemia and hemoglobinuria after exposure to cold weather. Although rare in children, it should not be disregarded in the differential diagnosis of macrohematuria. Treatment is symptomatic with warm electrolyte infusions and erythrocte transfusions.

Material and methods: We report a case with coexistence of MGA and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) with family history of renal failure and blindness. Results: A 9-year-old female patient applied with the history four pyelonephritis attacks, the last of which occurred two months ago requiring hospitalization. Physical examination revealed no growth retardation or urogenital malformation. Laboratory results showed high serum creatinine (0.9 mg/dL) with estimated glomerular filtration rate of 85 ml/min/ 1.73m2, and non-nephrotic proteinuria (8 mg/m2/hour). Bilateral kidney sizes were normal based on age and sex reference values on ultrasonography, no hydronephrosis was detected. Voiding cystourethrography showed Grade 3 VUR in the right kidney. DMSA performed three months after the last pyelonephritis revealed hypoactive lesions on the left kidney with a split function of 45%. The detailed family history revealed consanguineous parents, two siblings with severe visual impairment, end-stage renal disease in father, aunt and paternal grandmother. Her eye examination revealed MGS. Genetic analysis performed to explain eye and renal anomalies detected a pathogenic heterozygous mutation [c.430C>T(p.Gln144Ter)] on PAX-2 gene. She was diagnosed as papillorenal syndrome. The genetic analysis of the other family members are currently ongoing. Conclusions: PAX2 gene encodes a transcription factor which is essential for embryonic development of the kidney, eye and central nervous system. Pathogenic variants of PAX2 cause autosomal dominantly inherited disorders with wide phenotypic variability. 92% of the affected individuals have renal abnormalities while 77% have ophthalmologic abnormalities. Both abnormalities together are named papillorenal syndrome.

With Panel Reactive Antigen(PRA), both antibody screening and antibody identification can be done. In particular, identification of donor-specific antigens(DSA) that are well-known risk factors for shortened graft survival is important. In this study, we evaluated whether PRA positivity could be a stimulant for rejection in patients with stable graft functions. Material and methods: We used to monitor PRA and/or DSA twice a year in the last 5 years in addition to annual protocol biopsies in the first five years. We included the patients with positive PRAs and concurrent renal biopsies, and recorded the clinical outcome of the cases in the long term follow up. Patients with elevated serum creatinine were excluded. Results: This study included 12 patients (F/M:2/10) with kidney transplantation and increased MFI levels for PRA, and only 3 of those patients had DSA. While de novo DSA appeared in 2 patients in the 3rd year, it was seen in the other patient at the 5th year. 6 of the patients were transplanted from cadaveric donors. Only 1 patient had class I positivity. Eight patients had non-nephrotic proteinuria, and one of the patients with de novo DSA did not have proteinuria. The 3 patients with de novo DSA positivity and 5 of the remaining 9 patients with increasing titers of PRA had simultaneous rejection in their biopsies, which were all compatible with humoral rejection. All 8 patients with rejection had class II positivity. None of the 4 patients with PRA positivity but non-specific findings in the simultaneous biopsies had rejection in the follow-up. Conclusions: Recognition of rejection at an early stage before creatinine elevation is important for graft survival. The use of increased titers of PRA, even not determined as DSA, may be a warning marker for asymptomatic rejection and this data may be evaluated in larger series.",1.0,positive,True

1638,"Introduction: Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and plateletlymphocyte ratio (TLR) have become accepted markers of inflammation in recent years and are used to assess disease activity in some diseases. In this study, we investigated the relationship between NLR and TLR values and acute rejection (AR) attacks as well as their role in determining chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) in the follow-up of kidney transplant (KTx) patients. Material and methods: 58 KTx patients aged 5-18 years with at least 5year follow-up at our center were included. Patients with a history of secondary KTx, concomitant malignancy and a shorter follow-up time were excluded. Physical examination, medical history, laboratory parameters in the post-KTx 1st, 3rd and 6th month, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th years, and renal biopsy reports were reviewed. Results: Both NLR and TLR were significantly higher during AR attacks (p,""0.003 for NLR, p"",""0.002 for TLR). Although both NLR and TLR values were higher in patients with CAN at the end of 5-year post-KTx follow-up, the difference was not statistically significant (p"",0.69 for NLR and p,""0.55 for TLR). When the patients with and without CAN within 5 years were compared, the ones with CAN development had significantly higher NLR and TLR values in all periods in the post-KTx first 2 and 4 years, respectively. From the patients with AR attacks, those who subsequently developed CAN had higher NLR in the post-KTx first 3 years, and TLR was higher in post-KTx all time periods, although without a statistically significant level. Conclusions: This is the first study on evaluation of NLR and TLR in children with KTx. Our results indicate that both values can be used as useful and easily accessible markers in AR diagnosis and CAN prediction, the two major causes of post-KTx graft loss. Pediatric studies with larger populations are needed to support our findings.""",1.0,disease,True

Material and methods: An 8-year-old boy, who underwent appendectomy due to abdominal pain and vomiting and was discharged 2 days later, was admitted to the emergency service on the 3rd postoperative day with complaints of nausea, vomiting, and decreased urine output. The growth of the patient admitted to the emergency department was normal. The blood pressure was 145/90mmHg, consistent with stage-II hypertension. The patient, who was seen with tachycardia, tachypnea, and orthopnea in physical examination and the abdomen was distended. He had (+1) pretibial pitting edema. Laboratory tests revealed WBC:14700/ mm3, Hb:8.5gr/dL, plt 556000/mm3, urea 58mg/dL (N:10-38), serum creatinine 3.7 mg/dL (N:0.5-1.2), uric acid 12 mg/dL (N:2-5.5), albumin 3.1g/dL (N:3.5-5.5), LDH 443U/L (N:110-295), sodium 135 mmol/L (N:134-150), potassium 4.6 mmol/L(N:3.5-5.5), calcium 8.8mg/dL (N:8.8-10.8), phosphorus 9.9mg/dL (N:4-7), and CRP 87mg/L (N:0-5). His urine output was 1.1 cc/kg/h. Results: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed on the patient. Bilateral ureteral traces could not be evaluated. Diagnostic laparotomy was performed in the case with diffuse abdominal edema. It was observed that the appendix epiploic was diffuse and severely edematous. A double JJ catheter was placed in the bilateral ureters and the operation was terminated by taking the lymph node for the pathological sample. In 72 hours, creatinine decreased to 0.79 mg/dL and urine output returned to normal. The patient with CD10 and CD 20 positivity was diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma. Conclusions: In fast-growing hematological malignancies such as lymphoma, kidney functions may be impaired due to tumor involvement, or it may occur due to compression in intra-abdominal masses.

1654,"Introduction: Anti-complement factor H (FH) atypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) is due to the formation of anti-FH antibodies predisposed by deletions in complement FH-related protein (CFHR) genes1. The interrelation of the genetic predisposition to the antibody formation is still unclear and probably due to a ""second hit"" mechanism. We report a case of anti-FH aHUS occurring after meningococcal B (MenB) vaccination. Material and methods: We report a case of anti-FH aHUS occurring after meningococcal B (MenB) vaccination. Results: A 5-year-old female patient was referred to a Romanian hospital for HUS, presenting with severe haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury (serum creatinine 0.97 mg/dl). Fever, prodromic gastrointestinal symptoms and other accompanying features were not reported. The patient had undergone MenB vaccination booster two weeks before the onset of the clinical picture. C3 was reduced and microbiological analysis tested negative for VTEC. The patient was discharged without sequelae. Subsequent follow-up showed progressive hypertension that was successfully treated with RAS blockers. Haptoglobin was borderline, with normal LDH levels and without other signs of haemolysis; kidney function kept normal, urinary sediment was negative and sC5-b9 levels were normal. Functional testing for complement deregulation revealed high titre of anti-FH antibodies (1723 U/l, normal values <100 U/l). Genetic analysis with whole-exome sequencing showed a homozygous deletion of CFHR1 gene, but no rare pathogenic variants in complement genes. Severe hypertension despite mild non-relapsing aHUS suggested chronic post-AKI damage or latent disease activation. In this view, mycophenolate mofetil plus eculizumab were initiated to reduce anti-FH antibodies and allow the continuation of the vaccination schedule. At four months follow-up, anti-FH titles slightly decreased (1340 U/l). Conclusions: The MenB vaccines contain a polysaccharides epitope with structural similarity to human FH, potentially indicuing molecular mimicry and exposing to the risk of eliciting anti-FH antibodies in genetically predisposed subjects. However, aHUS after MenB exposure is not reported to date2. Interestingly, complete deletion of CFHR1 or CFHR3, observed in 5-6% of the general population, is not considered a risk factor for aHUS, but is associated with an increased risk of developing anti-FH antibodies.1 This case raises the concern about MenB vaccine as ""second hit"" in aHUS first episode or relapses among patients with CFHR protein mutations and increased risk of producing anti-FH antibodies.",1.0,case,True

1661,"Introduction: Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is one of the most common glomerular disorders of children. It may predispose to accelerated cardiovascular disease, expecially atherosclerosis and cause arterial stiffness due to hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia or useage of steroids. In this study, arterial stiffness indicators like PWV, AIx and ABPM were performed; also cardiac functions were evaluated by echocardiography in the patients with NS. It was aimed to evaluate whether there are any differences between the patients in terms of endothelial damage or cardiac functions. Material and methods: This is a single center, prospective, case-control study conducted on pediatric patients with NS. Patients were divided into groups according to their treatment modalities: steroid-only therapy (group 1) vs. steroid and another immunsupressive together (group 2). In addition, patients were evaluated in terms of endothelial damage and cardiac functions according to cumulative steroid doses. Results: Eighteen patients in group 1 and 14 patients in group 2 were included in the study. There was no difference between the groups in terms of sex. It was observed that age, BMI, cumulative steroid dose per kilogram, and hyperlipidemia were higher; mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, stroke volume, central blood pressure, PWV were higher; daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure loads and nocturnal diastolic blood pressure loads were higher; the left ventricular and interventricular septum wall thicknesses were higher, the left ventricular myocardial tissue performance index was lower, and the aortic diameter was larger in group 2. In addition, as the cumulative steroid dose per kilogram increased; BMI, hyperlipidemia, stroke volume, left ventricular and interventricular septum wall thicknesses, left ventricular mass index increased; left ventricular myocardial tissue perfusion index decreased. Conclusions: Cardiovascular dysfunction is more pronounced in group 2 due to more severe clinical symptoms. Even if patients with a diagnosis of NS are in remission, they should be evaluated regularly from a cardiovascular point of view.",1.0,disease,True

It is most often associated with an autoimmune disease, mostly lupus. The occurrence of early onset membranous nephropathy (MN) associated with semaphorin 3B has been reported to date in 9 children and 2 adults. Material and methods: Biopsies were performed on native kidney and one and 5 months after transplantation. semaphorin 3B antigen was detected in immune deposits by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy on paraffin-embedded biopsies. Anti-semaphorin antibodies were detected by Western blot and analyzed sequentially Results: We report the first case of early recurrence after transplantation in a 7-year old boy who presented with severe nephrotic syndrome and advanced kidney failure. There was no evidence of hereditary or associated autoimmune disease. Abundant, almost deposits were seen by electron microscopy and bright granular, subepithelial staining was observed for semaphorin 3B antigen. Western blot analysis of serum revealed the presence of anti-semaphorin antibodies. Recurrence of MN occurred 25 days after transplantation and manifested as nephrotic range proteinuria despite conventional immunosuppressive therapy. Kidney biopsies confirmed histological MN recurrence with colocalization of semaphorin 3B antigen and IgG as early as one months. The patient was treated with rituximab. Proteinuria dramatically decreased within 2 months and complete remission was obtained within 4 months Anti-semaphorin 3B antibodies were then not detected 40 days after rituximab. At one year after kidney transplantation, the patient has a sustained complete immunologic and clinical remission Conclusions: This case provides evidence that anti-semaphorin 3B antibodies are pathogenic and should be monitored in these patients.",1.0,disease,True

1670,"Introduction: Most cases of atypical Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (aHUS) are associated with mutations of genes encoding proteins involved in the alternate complement pathway. Recently, aHUS has been described in a syndrome involving congenital malformations associated with mutations in the TSEN2 gene. Here we report the case of 2 siblings with a similar phenotype and a mutation within the TSEN2 gene region. Material and methods: This is a case report. Results: A 4-year-old girl presented with non-specific symptoms of weakness and lethargy and was diagnosed with atypical HUS. She had a past medical history of faltering growth since the age of 2 years, with microcephaly and reported swallowing difficulties. Family history of childhood death in sibling with similar presentation at the same age, including faltering growth and swallowing difficulties, led to extensive investigations. Our patient was initially treated in intensive care due to severe hypertension. She received eculizumab infusions with subsequent response of thrombocytopenia and anaemia but no improvement in renal impairment. DNA analysed by direct sequencing of the entire coding regions for the CFH, CFI, CD46, C3, CFB, DGKE and MMACHC genes did not reveal any known pathogenic variants of atypical HUS. A kidney biopsy confirmed the picture of chronic thrombotic microangiopathy.

1676,"Introduction: Despite the wide use of steroids for idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) treatment during the past 60 years, the reliable marker of response is still lacking. Recently, a parameter known as the albuminbilirubin (ALBI) grade has been used in several malignant, infectious, and immune-mediated diseases to predict the prognosis and response to treatment. Material and methods: This was a single centre retrospective pilot study investigating the ALBI grade in children with non-genetic INS. Both albumin and bilirubin concentration were measured before the standard steroid regime was commenced, while patients were further divided according to response during 6 weeks of treatment. The ALBI grade was calculated based on the formula previously reported in the literature (log10 bilirubin [mol/L] × 0.66) + (albumin [g/L] × -0.0852). Results: Total of 18 responders and 6 non-responders were included, with the mean age of 6.14 and 6.02 years, respectively. The average ALBI score was -1,31 for responders and -1,14 for non-responders. Conclusions: The crucial role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of non-genetic INS has been widely accepted in recent years, although the precise mechanisms remain inconclusive, and most probably multifactorial. Consequently, a possible systemic subclinical inflammation involving the liver might contribute to the underlying disease processes. In this context, the albumin and bilirubin might be further explored beyond their mechanical role in the maintenance of oncotic pressure, as a negative marker of inflammation and liver damage. Therefore, despite the lack of statistical significance, most probably due to a small number of patients, the result of our study indicates that the ALBI grade, highly representative of the complex albumin and bilirubin interactions, might have a value as a marker of outcome in INS.",1.0,infectious,True

1692,"Introduction: Membranous Nephropathy (MN) is a morphological pattern characterized by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane. Although it is one of the most frequent causes of nephrotic syndrome in adults, it accounts for < 5% of cases among children. Material and methods: Case 1: A 16-year-old girl treated with penicillamine for Wilson's disease presented with nephrotic syndrome. Penicillamine was withhold. Maintenance therapy with zinc acetate was initiated and, transiently, enalapril and furosemide were added. Due to worsening oedema, prednisolone was started. Kidney histopathology was consistent with membranous nephropathy type I. Serum anti-PLA2R and tissue staining for PLA2R were both negative. Nephrotic syndrome remitted in one month, and the proteinuria resolved in six months. Case 2: A 16-year-old girl with inflammatory bowel disease, pyoderma gangrenosum and a previous history of nephritic-nephrotic syndrome presented with worsening systemic inflammation and increasing proteinuria. Amyloidosis was excluded. The kidney histopathology revealed membranous nephropathy type I. Serum anti-PLA2R antibodies and tissue staining for PLA2R were negative. Systemic inflammation was controlled under infliximab with progressive proteinuria resolution. Case 3: A 15-year-old previously healthy girl presented with nephrotic proteinuria without hypoalbuminemia. The immunological and infectious studies were unremarkable. Kidney histopathology showed membranous type II with parietal granular deposits of IgG (mostly IgG1 +++ and IgG3 +/-), IgM (++), C1q (++) and IgA (+/-). Serum anti-PLA2R and tissue staining for PLA2R were negative. Results: MN in paediatric patients is often secondary to drug exposure or systemic illness, as seen in cases 1 and 2, respectively. In case 3, despite the absence of circulating anti-PLA2R antibodies and negative tissue staining for PLA2R, the immunohistochemical findings suggest secondary MN. However, no other criteria of systemic illness have been found. Conclusions: These three cases illustrate that proteinuria is the clinical hallmark of MN and demonstrate the diversity of the underlying aetiology of this histological pattern, whose identification is paramount to guide treatment.",1.0,case,True

1702,"Anamnesis/Background: An eleven-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital emergency department due to recurrent haematuria. He reported three transient episodes of terminal macroscopic haematuria in the last five months (the first one a few days after a bicycle accident and another immediately after exercise), without other associated symptoms (fever or other genitourinary signs). He was previously healthy, was under no medication, had no known allergies and his vaccines were in schedule. There was no history of renal diseases in the family. Physical Examination: At our observation he was apyretic and had no abnormalities at physical examination, namely on the cardiovascular and abdominopelvic exams. Height was at percentile (P)50-85, body mass index at P15-50 and blood pressure inferior to P90. Complementary Diagnostic Tests: Urinalysis evidenced haematuria and a normal protein/creatinine ratio (0,14mg/mg). There were no abnormal findings on blood analyses (blood count, C-reactive protein, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, ionogram, hepatobiliary parameters and autoimmune study). The renal-bladder ultrasonography described a diffusely thickened bladder with regular contours and a post-voiding residue >10% of the maximum bladder volume, no endoluminal abnormalities and preserved parenchymal renal differentiation. A CT-urogram showed a bilateral piellic dilation (right pelvis: 25mm; left pelvis: 13mm); the right ureter was dilatated (maximum gauge: 11mm), with a slight delay in elimination; the bladder had diffused parietal thickening that was prominent at the level of the vesical trigone (maximum thickness: 14mm). Voiding cystourethrography confirmed the diagnosis of posterior urethral valves. Learning Points of the Case: Posterior urethral valves are one of the most common congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, and can occur in varying degrees of severity, depending on the time of diagnosis. Infants and older boys with undiagnosed posterior urethral valves can present in a diversity of ways, including macroscopic haematuria. An early diagnosis is essential to preserve renal function.",1.0,vaccine,True

1707,"Introduction: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessively inherited autoinflammatory disorder which has a classical presentation with self-limited periodic attacks of fever and polyserositis in childhood. However, it may rarely present with unexplained proteinuria/ nephrotic syndrome due to amyloid nephropathy. Material and methods: Herein, we describe a case with nephrotic syndrome diagnosed with amyloidosis on renal biopsy. Results: A 9-year-old female patient admitted with edema of ankles and eyes for two months. She had a history of recurrent fever, stomachache lasting for one day. The parents described occasionaly artralgia unrelated with fever periods. The family history was irrelevant, no consanguineous marriage was noted. On physical examination, she had normal growth parameters (height of 1.36 m, SDS:-0.12 and weight of 32 kg, SDS:0.02). The blood pressure was normal. She had abdominal distention with palpable hepatosplenomegaly. She had bilateral pretibial edema. Laboratory tests showed hypoalbuminemia (1.7 mg/dL), nephrotic proteinuria (355 mg/m2/day). Viral serology was negative. The levels of C3 and C4 were normal. Anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double strand DNA, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 125 mm/hour. Tuberculin skin test was negative. During her hospitalization, we observed periodic fever attacks at three-day intervals, one of them was accompanied with arthritis. Due to atypical presentation, the renal biopsy was performed resulting amyloid-A deposition. Based on the anamnesis and clinical observations, we preliminary diagnosed FMF. Serum amyloid A level was found 746 mg/L (N: 0-6.5). Colchicine (1 mg/day) was started. Anti-IL1, anakinra (100 mg/day) was started after genetic analysis showing homozygous M694V mutation. Now, she is on third month of treatment. She still needs regular albumin infusions with resistant nephrotic syndrome. Conclusions: Renal amyloidosis is the most severe complication of FMF, mainly affected the patients with homozygous M694V mutations.

1717,"Introduction: Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) is a rare complication in children with temporal association with COVID 19. MIS-C criteria include: persistent fever, multisystem involvement and elevated markers of inflammation. Renal involvement is a rare reported manifestation of MIS-C, most commonly presented as acute kidney injury (AKI) and seldom as hematuria, proteinuria and pyuria. The aim of this case is is to evaluate the diversity of renal clinical manifestations of MISC. Material and methods: We consulted the databases of PubMed and Google Scholar using the keywords: kideny, MIS-C, AKI. The following parameters were noted from the studies including MIS-C patients: renal impairment, treatment, and outcome. Results: We present a case of 11 years old girl without comorbidities, who presented to our pediatric emergency for persistent fever, abdominal pain, hematuria. Her recent medical history included exposure to SARSCOV2 infection in December 2021. At the physical examination, she was febrile and well appearing. Blood tests showed neutrophilic leukocytosis, elevated markers of inflammation, troponin, proBNP, D-dimers, fibrinogen, creatinine and urea. Urine test showed hematuria, associated with proteinuria and pyuria. Positive IgG SARS-COV2 confirmed clinical suspicion of MIS-C.

The purpose of our study was to investigate use of the CKiD under 25 (CKiDU25) equation in comparison with the Schwartz bedside equation in adolescents during transition to adult healthcare. Material and methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the medical records of 287 seventeen-year old patients (47.4% females) with CKD or/and AKD without AKI who were hospitalized at the Voronezh Regional Children's Clinical Hospital. We calculated and compared the eGFR using the Schwartz bedside, age-dependent CKiDU25, and constant CKiDU25 based on creatinine. The absolute difference was calculated by subtracting Schwartz bedside values from age-dependent CKiDU25 values. The results were presented as a median and interquartile range [IQR]. Results: The median eGFR values using the Schwartz bedside, agedependent CKiDU25, and constant CKiDU25 were 88 [78-103], 99 [86-109], and 86 [76-96] mL/min/1.73m2, respectively. The median eGFR values for males using the same equations were 82 [72-91], 100 [87-111], and 83 [73-93] mL/min/1.73m2, and those for females were 98 [85-110], 98 [85-109], and 89 [77-100] mL/min/1.73m2, respectively. The median absolute difference between the age-dependent CKiDU25 and Schwartz bedside in males was 16,7 [14,6-19,5], and that for females was -0,8 [-1,4- -0,1] mL/min/1.73m2. We found that 71 (24,7%) adolescents (100% males) needed reclassification upward of their KDIGO GFR category using age-dependent CKiDU25 instead of the Schwartz bedside equation, particularly between the G2-G1 and G3A-G2 categories. There was no need to change the GFR categories in females and patients of both genders with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2.

A list of CKD patients ages 6-21 years were identified in the nephrology clinic. Chart review was performed to confirm which patients had ABPMs performed and what percentage of these were diagnosed with masked HTN. Exclusion criteria included patients out of this age range and those with known diagnosis of HTN. The measures included the percentage of patients using ABPM (process) and the percentage of patients identified as having masked HTN with ABPM. There were a total of two interventions performed including placing sticky note reminders in patient charts to screen for masked HTN using ABPM and a poster placed in the clinic room targeted towards patients with CKD. Results: 92 nephrology clinic patients met inclusion criteria. The percentage of patients using ABPM increased from 0% to 18% (n,17) by the end of December 2021. 53% (n,""9) of these patients were identified as having masked HTN.

Patient aged between 1-18 years old, having both urinalysis and serum creatinine measurement were consecutively included, patients with urinary tract infection were excluded. ""Elevated serum creatinine"" and AKI were defined as serum creatinine is above and 1.5 times higher than age-specific upper limit of reference interval, respectively. Results: A total of 228 patients were evaluated [median (IQR) age 12.7 years (7.5; 16,1), 51.3 % were male]. The prevalence of hematuria, proteinuria and elevated serum creatinine was 15.8% (36/228), 6% (14/228) and 3% (7/228), respectively. None of the patients met the AKI criteria. Kidney involvement (at least one of hematuria, proteinuria and/or elevated serum creatinine) was observed in 23.2% of all cohort (53/228) and 43.5% (10/23) in hospitalized children.

1765,"Introduction: Among the data collected during history taking in children with suspected hypertension there is an information on the symptoms of arterial hypertension. Symptoms commonly considered to be typical of high blood pressure are headache, epistaxis, palpitations, sleep disturbances, blurry vision, fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance. The literature doesn't provide much data on the frequency of symptoms of arterial hypertension in children. The predictive value of the symptoms in children referred to the diagnosis of hypertension is uncertain. The aim of the study was to determine whether the symptoms reported by children with suspected hypertension are related to elevated blood pressure and whether analysis of symptoms considered typical for hypertension is of diagnostic importance. Material and methods: The study was retrospective analysis of data of 471 patients aged 5 to 18 referred for the diagnosis of hypertension. The medical records were analyzed with regard to a kind of reported symptoms and the significance of symptoms in relation to the final diagnosis. Results: More than half of the patients (55.5%) were asymptomatic. The most common symptom was headache (28%) and less commonly reported were: chest pain (6.6%), syncope (6.5%), epistaxis (6%), dizziness (5.3%), weakness (4, 3%), palpitations (3.4%), flushing (1%). In asymptomatic patients, the diagnosis of elevated blood pressure or hypertension was more frequent than the diagnosis of normal blood pressure. Patients with headaches were mostly normotensive, as well as patients with chest pain. Syncope was most commonly observed in patients with essential hypertension. Epistaxis, weakness and flushing were not characteristic of patients diagnosed with arterial hypertension. Conclusions: Hypertension in children is mainly asymptomatic. The symptoms so far described as indictive of hypertension are not predictive of this condition. The key to proper and timely diagnosis of hypertension is routine blood pressure measurements during medical check-ups.",1.0,asymptomatic,True

We purely analysed for complications of sedation such as respiratory depression, oxygen requirement, hypotension, or the need for an alternative form of sedation. Results: We undertook 170 renal biopsies in the outlined time period, 30 were excluded due to being under general anaesthetic (usually due to age). Of the remaining 140 biopsies, 43 biopsies used the old protocol, 39 the new protocol, and 58 used Entonox. Of the 39 patients on the new protocol of Ketamine and Midazolam, no patients had any sedation caused complications. This compares equally to no patients on the old protocol. Furthermore, when looking at the 58 patients who received solely Entonox, the only complication that arose was 4 patients needing further intravenous sedation, one of these patients also vomited after Entonox. Conclusions: We have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of using a Ketamine and Midazolam combination for conscious sedation during elective renal biopsies for children. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Entonox alone is a safe and efficacious method of sedation for many renal biopsy patients. Entonox is frequently used for painful procedures, but not commonly for renal biopsies.

1792,"Introduction: The best treatment in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is still debated. Based on the evidence that a dysfunctional mucosal immune system can lead to abnormal glomerular IgA deposition, release of steroid directly to ileal Payer's patches appears a promising prospective. The trials NEFIGAN and NEFIGARD have demonstrated that targeted release-formulation (TRF)-budesonide, in conjunction with reninangiotensin-aldosterone system -inhibitors (RAASi), efficiently and safely reduced proteinuria in adults, leading to FDA approvement of TARPEYO as the first specific drug for adult IgAN. In pediatric IgAN, the main therapies remain RAAS-inhibitors and oral steroids. To our knowledge, this is one of the few reports of TRF-budesonide therapy in a pediatric patient. Material and methods: A 13-year-old boy underwent a kidney biopsy for recurrent macrohematuria and proteinuria, showing IgAN, with a MEST-C score of M1-E1-S0-T0-C1. At admission, serum creatinine was 0.67 mg/dL and UPCR 0.76 mg/mg with macrohematuria. Three methylprednisolone pulses were performed, followed by a 6-month course of prednisone, along with RAASi therapy. After an initial improvement, 10 months from onset, macrohematuria became constant and UPCR increased again up to 0.48 mg/mg. A second renal biopsy showed an increase in sclerotic lesions (S1). Prednisone was discontinued, and a trial with TRF-budesonide 9 mg/day started, increasing ramipril dose to 7.5 mg/day. Results: One month later, macrohematuria finally disappeared and UPCR decreased to 0.36 mg/mg, with a stable renal function. After 5 months, due to reduction in morning cortisol levels, we started to wean TRF-budesonide by 3 mg every 3 months, increasing ramipril dose to 10 mg/day. Macrohematuria recurred occasionally during intercurrent infectious episodes and proteinuria newly increased to UPCR 0.62 mg/mg, with a slight worsening of renal function. Conclusions: Our case suggests that TRF-budesonide may be an effective dose-dependent treatment, even in complex pediatric IgAN cases. However, a pediatric clinical trial to identify correct dosage and tolerability of TRF-formulation, is needed.",1.0,trial,True

1813,"Introduction: Hypertension is considered a potential complication of multicystic dysplastic kidney(MCDK). However, there is limited evidence on the prevalence of hypertension based on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring(ABPM). The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors for hypertension in children with MCDK. Material and methods: Fifty-four children with MCDK and 20 healthy children participated in this single-center cross-sectional study. Hypertension was determined by office measurement and ABPM. Compensatory hypertrophy was defined as kidney volume above the 95th percentile on kidney ultrasound. Estimated GFR was calculated using the modified Schwartz formula. Microalbuminuria was defined as urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) >30 mg/g. Results: The median (iqr) age of patients was 10.4 (7.5-13.5) years, and the male-to-female ratio was 1.1/1.0. The left kidney was affected in 59% of cases (n,""32). Total involution was observed in 30 patients (56%), regression of MCDK in 20 patients (37%), and nephrectomy was performed in four patients (7%) due to unchanged or increased size. In the contralateral kidney, compensatory hypertrophy was noted in 50 patients (92.5%) and a concomitant urinary abnormality in ten patients (13.5%). There were no differences between patients and controls in terms of age, sex, BMI, SD scores of ABPM values, eGFR, or urine ACR. A total of three patients (5.6%) had hypertension (one sustained hypertension, one masked hypertension, and one controlled hypertension). In addition, seven patients (12.9%) had white coat hypertension. Four patients had hyperfiltration (GFR>130 mL/min/1.73m2) and five patients had microalbuminuria. The 24-hour MAP-SDS showed no association with the presence of MCDK, contralateral kidney volume, or eGFR. Conclusions: Approximately 6% of children with MCDK have hypertension according to ABPM. Our results do not suggest a causal relationship between hypertension and MCDK itself or the contralateral kidney. Identification of risk factors for hypertension in this population remains a challenge.""",1.0,case,True

However, studies have shown that tubular damage and interstitial fibrosis contribute to the progression of Alport syndrome. In this study, we wanted to assess whether urinary protheolis factors are associated with disease progression and to determine their prognostic value in children with X-linked Alport syndrome. Material and methods: 32 children (15M/17F) with X-linked Alport syndrome and normal renal function (CKD gr.1) were examined. All children received therapy with ACE inhibitors. The median age was 10.5 (IQR: 7.5;15). The median follow-up period was 5.5 (IQR:3.5;6.5) years. The control group consisted of 12 age-matched healthy children with normal renal function. Laboratory tests included serum creatinine, MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-9 and their inhibitors TIMP-1 and 2, PAI-I in urine (were corrected for urinary creatinine excretion), determined by ELISA. A decrease in eGFR of 30% over 2 years from baseline was chosen to represent the rapidly progressive course. 28.1% of children had a rapidly progressive course of the disease (7M/2F), 71.9%-a slowly progressive course (8M/15F).

Bladder closure in early childhood creates a risk for upper urinary tract damage due to bladder dysfunction, VUR, hydronephrosis and recurrent UTI's. There is limited data on the long term outcome of kidney function in this cohort. Material and methods: Bladder exstrophy patients treated at our institution during the last 10 years were identified . Kidney damage was assessed by evaluating their last available eGFR, albuminuria and beta2mikroglobulin levels. Kidney corticomedullary differentiation and the presence of hydronephrosis were evaluated by ultrasound and kidney differential function by dynamic scintigraphy. Continence status, bladder capacity and performance of CIC were used as markers of bladder function. Results: Fifteen subjects were identified: eight females and seven males of an average age of 5 years (1-11) . None of the children had a decreased eGFR <90ml/min/1,73m2, and all had normal blood pressure values. Albuminuria was present in a single subject and increased beta2microglobuline in two. Loss of corticomedullary differentiation was present in in 3 children in at least one renal unit. Bilateral hydronephrosis was present in 6 subjects and differential kidney function was abnormal in 5. Bladder capacity was decreased in 13 children when compared expected bladder capacity for age (EBC); 8/13 children above 5yrs old were incontinent and 7/15 required CIC (clean intermittent catheterization). Conclusions: At a mean age of 5 yrs 33% have developed stage I chronic kidney disease underscoring that regular nephrological evaluation is mandatory in children born with bladder exstrophy.

A preparatory therapy for transplantation was carried out, the prophylaxis of transplant rejection included methotrexate, ATG and cyclosporine. Hematopoietic cells were transplanted from an unrelated donor, compatible with 9/10 HLA. Material and methods: In the posttransplant course from day 1, intensive gastrointestinal mucositis was observed requiring opioid analgesics and parenteral nutrition which then progressed to gastrointestinal bleeding. On day +3 patient's general condition worsened, she developed fever, dyspnea with the necessity of oxygen therapy, and inflammatory markers increased. Staphylococcus hominis was found in blood culture, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (day +8). Antibiotic therapy was modified, immunoglobulins and steroid therapy were applied and intensive symptomatic treatment was implemented. Chest X-ray revealed signs interstitial pneumonia with a possible etiology of pneumocystosis, therefore pentamidine was also used. Severe hemorrhagic diarrhea and increasing parameters of renal failure (from day +3) were observed (maximum serum creatinine 110 umol/l, cystatin C 2,26 mg/). The doses of drugs were adjusted to GFR (45 ml/min/1,73m2), cyclosporin (then serum drug concertation 98,07 ng/ml) was changed to tacrolimus (maximum serum concertation 33,8 ng/ml) - that was gradually discontinued.

Ciprofloxacin was administered, followed by cidofovir resulting in decreased hematuria - without complete disappearing of bladder inflammation. On day +49 CMV reactivation was found. Ganciclovir was administered. Results: Due to the persistence of hemorrhagic cystitis, non-standard therapy with leflunomide was implemented. Gradually, complete resolution of the hemorrhagic cystitis was observed. Methylprednisolone treatment was started and tacrolimus was discontinued. After clinical stabilization, the girl was discharged home. The development of stage 3 chronic kidney disease and arterial hypertension remained as complications in further follow-up.

1838,"Introduction: Nocturnal enuresis is caused by nocturnal urine production and functional bladder capacity mismatch. ICCS suggests patient classification into MNE and NMNE, where MNE is likely to respond to desmopressin and/or alarm. This led to the misconception that NMNE could not benefit from desmopressin. With the recent ICCS standardization, most patients are now labeled NMNE. Desmopressin's anti-diuretic effect and renal concentrating response have no direct correlation with bladder dysfunction and should be evaluated independently. Many patients have LUTS and nocturnal polyuria and could benefit from desmopressin in combination therapy. Material and methods: Aim: identify patients in a tertiary center who might benefit from desmopressin (defined as urinary osmolality (Uosmol)<850 mOsm/l) and study the timing overnight.

Conclusions: Classification into MNE and NMNE is mainly bladder/ LUTS driven and is widely accepted to predict the anti-enuretic effect of therapy, thus an indication for desmopressin. However, many patients have a combination of LUTS and abnormal circadian diuresis pattern. Desmopressin's anti-diuretic effect may be expected in most patients with high diuresis and low Uosmol overnight. >50% of patients have a low Uosmol early the night, hence a therapeutic window for desmopressin. In 1/3 patients, Uosmol remains longer low, needing longer-acting V2-stimulation, without risk of too prolonged action.

Impaired peroxisomal function in affected individuals can manifest a complex spectrum of clinical phenotypes. Nephrological clinical features are described: kidney cortical microcysts and calcium-oxalate stones, attributed to potential oxalate metabolism dysfunction. Material and methods: We describe a patient affected by PBDs diagnosed after spontaneous expulsion of a renal stone. Results: A two-month-old boy without familial or personal history of interest was admitted because of cholestasis detected during patient evaluation for growth retardation, bloody stools and irritability. On physical examination, patient's appearance was characterized by facial asymmetry, marked philtrum and epicanthus inversus. Etiological studies, included evaluation for infection, renal function and metabolic disorders, didn´t reveal any abnormality, except mild elevation of liver enzymes. At 4 months of age, the patient spontaneously passed a kidney stone. Kidney function was normal but ultrasound showed bilateral nephrocalcinosis grade 1. Mild hypertransaminasemia persisted without cholestasis. Further metabolic assessment demonstrated repeated hyperoxaluria oxalate/creatinine 392 mmol/mol and 551 mmol/mol (normal value for age 370 mmol/mol), increased glycolate and increased of 2-hydroxy-sebacic acid in urine, all together lead to the suspicion of a peroxisomal disorder. Stone composition was mainly calcium oxalate monohydrate. Extended metabolic study confirmed elevated very-long-chain-fatty acids in plasma and genetic test confirmed the diagnosis of peroxisomal disorder. The patient carried a compound heterozygous pathogenic variants (c.2097dupT, c.3077T>C) in PEX1 gen. Treatment with increased fluid intake and urine alkalinization with citrate salts was performed.

Material and methods: We describe a clinical case of a patient with SIOD after kidney transplantation. Results: At the age of 3 years a boy was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome resistant to steroids and cyclosporine A, which led to the ESRD by the age of 5. At the age of 5,8 years he received a kidney from a deceased donor. On the eve of operation, the patient received an intravenous induction therapy: methylprednisolone (MP) and basiliximab. The maintenance therapy included MP, azathioprine and tacrolimus. By the second month after the transplantation frequent viral infections, leukopenia and lymphopenia appeared, which required the reduction of azathioprine. After the normalization of leukocyte level the boy was swiched to mycophenolate sodium (MS). It was accompanied by a significant decrease in the level of leucocytes and lymphocytes, frequent herpes infections. The reduction of MS didn't lead to a positive result, and antimetabolites were canceled. MP (4 mg) was prescribed every day (before that every other day). Subsequently while taking reducing azathioprine or MS dose leukopenia increased, infectious complications reoccurred. Antimetabolites were finally canceled in 5,5 years after transplantation. Thus, a 2-component immunosuppressive therapy is optimal for the patient: MP and tacrolimus. During the last 3 years kidney function remains stable. The current blood level of creatinine is 63 mol/l.Donor-specific antibodies were not revealed. Conclusions: The immunosuppressive therapy for patients with SIOD after kidney transplantation should be individual because they have primary T-cell immunodeficiency.",1.0,case,True

Nevertheless >45% of children may relapse and many will demonstrate a protracted steroid dependent(SDNS) or frequently relapsing (FRNS) disease lasting throughout childhood. Subjects with SDNS/FRNS are at risk of frequent hospitalizations and numerous side effects of steroid and immunosuppressive treatment. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody has raised hopes of higher cure rates and decreased treatment related morbidity. Randomized trials on the efficacy of early rituximab treatment of SDNS/FRNS in children are lacking. Material and methods: A multicentre, randomized double blinded study has been designed to assess the efficacy and safety of early treatment with rituximab for children with SDNS/FRNS prior to any traditional immunosuppressive therapy. Recruitment is planned from - 9 major University Hospitals. 60 children are to be randomised (30 to rituximab, 30 to a placebo arm) following remission of NS achieved with steroids. Rituximab will be given in two infusions of 375mg/m2 and compared to placebo with further cessation of steroids. The primary endpoint of the study is time of survival without relapse in double blinded phase. The secondary endpoints are: time to treatment failure, total dose of steroids, correlation of relapse with lymphocyte B counts, rituximab concentration and presence of anti- rituximab antibodies, immunofenotype and genotype of subjects. Urine and blood tests will be collected according to the study protocol during screening and at monthly control visits for 12 months observation period.

1871,"Introduction: Good treatment compliance in nephropathic cystinosis (NC) may lead to healthcare cost-savings by avoiding/postponing end stage renal disease (ESRD). This study compared the lifetime ESRD cost implications of delayed-release cysteamine-bitartrate (DR-CYS) with immediate-release-CYS (IR-CYS) resulting from a difference in compliance for NC patients in the United Kingdom (UK). Material and methods: A partitioned-survival model involving three health states- ESRD-free, post-ESRD, and death - was developed in Microsoft Excel® to model lifetime patient progression using 1-year cycles. Health state membership was determined by independently modelled survival-curves. Reference survival curves (time-to-ESRD and time-to-death) were derived from Brodin-Sartorius et al.(2012) study. For each treatment arm, the time-to-ESRD curve was modified by a compliance-dependant hazard-ratio (HR); the time-to-death curve was modified by HR suggested by clinical experts. Compliance was measured using a ""composite compliance score"" (CCS), a function of mean treatment duration and mean-annual cystine level. The annual cost of ESRD, comprising of dialysis and kidney transplant costs, was applied to the time spent in the post-ESRD state. Costs (2020 prices) were discounted at 3.5%. Results: The ESRD lifetime-costs were £144,000 and £209,243 for DRCYS and IR-CYS patients respectively, resulting in cost-savings of £65,243/patient in the DR-CYS arm. The difference in dialysis costs (£211,225 [DR-CYS] vs. £295,146 [IR-CYS]) contributed significantly to the DR-CYS cost-savings of £58,379. Scenario analyses showed results were most sensitive to assumptions regarding treatment duration. Assuming mean treatment duration for DR-CYS patients (22 years in the base case) equalled life expectancy (61 years), DR-CYS costs-savings increased to £209,127. Conclusions: The study results demonstrated that improved compliance with DR-CYS in NC patients resulted in substantial ESRD lifetime costsavings in the UK. As this study exclusively focused on a vital complication of NC, the results are likely a significant underestimation of true costs-savings.",1.0,disease,True

However, after a very short time, the oral phosphorus solution had to be started again (30 mg/kg/d) because the serum phosphorus decreased to 1.1 mg/dL and the patient had profound muscle weakness. Abundant hydration was provided throughout the whole early post-transplant period when PTH levels remained high. Control allograft biopsy was performed in the 1st post-transplant year, and it revealed persistence in the findings in terms of acute phosphate nephropathy as well as moderate degrees of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Nevertheless, in the 4th post-transplant year, no significant deterioration in the kidney functions; her current serum creatinine level is 1.36 mg/dL. Conclusions: With this case, we would like to emphasize that it should be kept in mind that even when using a drug that seems innocent, especially in kidney transplant recipients, the possibility of causing allograft dysfunction and the physiologic/pathophysiologic mechanisms should be considered while prescribing each drug.",1.0,positive,True

1881,"Introduction: Rituximab(Rtx) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20 antigen on the surface of mature B lymphocytes. In nephrology practice, it is used in the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection(AMR) and steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome. ts reported side effects are ranging from mild reactions such as local erythema to acute lung injury(ALI) and anaphylaxis in acute phase, and increased risk of infection and malignancy in a longer period. Premedication is recommended especially in atopic individuals. In this report, a case of ALI occured in an atopic patient receiving Rtx for AMR is presented. Material and methods: Case: Our patient with CKD secondary to bilateral hypodysplasia had kidney transplantation from a living donor when he was 12 years old. Seven years after transplantation, kidney biopsy was performed due to high titer of positive donor-specific antibody. AMR was diagnosed and plasmapheresis was initiated after three doses of 500mg pulse methylprednisolone. Seven sessions of plasmapheresis was completed with premedication. IVIG treatment could not be completed because of development of anaphylaxis. Rituximab treatment was planned. After antihistaminic and 40mg methylprednisolone, 500mg Rtx was infused slowly. Mild nausea was occured during the infusion but resolved spontaneously. Sudden onset of dyspnea was observed following the end of the infusion, didnt respond to adrenaline. There was bilateral crackles on pulmonary examination and capillary oxygen saturation was 85% in room air. Computed tomography(CT) showed bilateral diffuse ground glass opacities. After excluding infectious and cardiac etiologies, 250mg methylprednisolone was given due to findings consistent with ALI approximately 6 hours after the RTX infusion. The steroid was tapered within days, after administration of 160mg/day methylprednisolone for the first three days. He recovered completely on the third day. Currently his pulmonary function is completely normal. Conclusions: Rituximab is a high-risk agent and should be used with attention. One of the most serious side effects is ALI. It is a rare but potentially fatal pulmonary toxicity and severe/permanent damage may occur. Early high-dose steroid therapy is the most important factor",1.0,case,True

1887,"Introduction: Neurogenic bladder(NB) is a clinical entity characterized by dysfunctional contraction of detrusor muscle secondary to damaged spinal cord or lower urinary tract obstruction(LUTO). Besides, in non-neurogenic neurogenic bladder(NNNB), findings are similar with NB but without LUTO or spinal injury. Patients with Ochoa syndrome(urofacial syndrome) have a typical smile like crying and NNNB; which occurs due to Heparanase2(HPSE2) mutation. In this report, two siblings with voiding dysfunction diagnosed as Ochoa syndrome are presented. Material and methods: Cases A six-year-old male was admitted to nephrology outpatient clinic with all day urinary incontinence. On physical examination, marked growth retardation and dysmorphic face were remarkable. He was diagnosed as chronic kidney disease(CKD) secondary to hydronephrotic scarred kidneys. Vesicoureteral reflux(VUR) was not detected in voiding cystourethrography(VCUG). There was no spinal pathology in magnetic resonance imaging(MRI). Posterior urethral valve was not detected on cystoscopy, but severe trabeculation and multiple diverticules were seen. A Low-capacity, high-pressure and hypocompliant bladder was detected by urodynamics and NNNB was diagnosed. He is still being followed up as stage-3 CKD with clean intermittent catheterization(CIC) and anticholinergic treatment. A ten-year-old girl, sister of the 1st patient, was also admitted to nephrology outpatient clinic with all day urinary incontinence and recurrent urinary tract infection. She always shows a facial expression that resembles crying. She was defined as CKD secondary to hydronephrotic scarred kidney. Left sided VUR was detected in VCUG. High-pressure NB was diagnosed by urodynamics. There was no spinal pathology. She is still being followed up with CIC and anticholinergic treatments. Genetic examination was performed due to NNNB and dysmorphic face in both siblings and homozygous c.436_437 deletion was found in the HPSE2 gene consistent with Ochoa syndrome. Conclusions: Early diagnosis and treatment of NB is important to prevent kidney damage.

Our latest research revealed the congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) phenotype culminating in renal hypoplasia followed by foot process effacement in the kidney glomeruli and functional decline kidney tissue of yotari. This study aimed to determine how functional silencing of the Dab1 gene affects the spatial and temporal patterns of expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), and receptor-interacting protein kinase 5 (RIP5) in the developing and postnatal kidneys of yotarimice as possible predictors of normal kidney formation and function. Material and methods: Animals were sacrificed on the gestation days E13.5 and E15.5 and postnatal days P4, P11, and P14. Analyses were performed using immunohistochemistry and fluorescent microscopy, followed by quantification of positive cells in kidney substructures. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Results: Dab1-/- animal kidneys exhibit decreased FGFR1/FGFR2 expression, suggesting the involvement of the observed markers in generating the CAKUT phenotype leading to renal hypoplasia. Between all developmental periods tested, there was no alteration in the immunoreactivity of RIP5 cells in the substructures of yotari kidneys. Conclusions: The abundant presence of observed proteins in kidneys and the dynamics of their expression found in this study suggest that FGFR1, FGFR2 and RIP5 play essential roles not only in early metanephric mesenchymal patterning, ureteric bud branching morphogenesis, nephrogenesis, and nephron progenitor survival but also in the maintenance of overall homeostasis and the maturation of kidney structures in the postnatal phase. Our results emphasize the crucial significance of the examined markers throughout normal kidney development and their potential involvement in renal pathology and diagnostics, where they could potentially serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",1.0,flu,True

1903,"Introduction: Renal injury is a frequent complication during the treatment of childhood cancers, due to tumor lysis syndrome, nephrotoxic drugs, septic periods. As a consequence of multiple acute AKI episodes with variable and multifactorial origin along the course of oncological treatment, there is a notably higher chance for the occurance of chronic kidney disease at long term. Material and methods: We investigated the diagnostic value of urinary N-acetyl--D-glucosaminidase (uNAG) as an early marker of renal tubular damage and acute kidney injury. This retrospective clinical analysis included 415 uNAG measurements in 35 children with neoplastic disorders, who had serial uNAG tests (min. 5 samples/patient). Renal function was determined by cystatin-C and creatinine based GFR, relative increase of uNAG index, along with patients' general condition and medication were registered. We focused on detecting both clinical and subclinical AKI episodes (according to Biomarker-Guided Risk Assessment with the using pRIFLE criteria and /or elevated uNAG levels) and the incidence of chronic kidney damage. Results: 63 episodes in 27 patients were identified during the observation period with positivity at least in one parameter of the kidney panel. We detected 20/63 clinical and 12/63 subclinical renal episodes. In 28/63 episodes only uNAG values was elevated without acute therapeutic consequence. Almost complete recovery of tubular damage was observed in 13/27 patients, while chronic tubuloglomerular injury occurred in 5/27 patients. Conclusions: We found that repeated measurements of uNAG, in combination with other renal parameters, is a sensible, non-invasive and economic marker for monitoring renal function in both acute and follow up periods. The serum creatinine value is not an early marker of renal damage and its level is often measured to be low among cancer patients due to malnutrition and decreased muscle mass. Our observation highlight the importance of using multi-marker AKI signaling approach to assess changes in kidney/tubular function in pediatric hemato-oncology patients.",1.0,disease,True

SOX 4 pathogenic variants are associated to developmental delay, intellectual disability, and mild facial and digital morphological abnormalities Material and methods: We reported for the first time a 3-year-old girl with the association of intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, oligoamnios, antenatal micro and macrocystic kidneys, neonatal kidney failure rapidly progressing to ESRD from 12 months old, feeding difficulties, microcephaly, retarded psychomotor and intellectual development, especially in language and walk, neonatal hypotonia and spastic diplegia with right reducible equinovarus foot, distal end of spinal cord, thin aspect of chiasma and optic nerves without vision defect, transitory hepatic cytolysis, adenoid and tonsil hypertrophy leading to hypoacousia and sleep apnea, mild facial dysmorphism with wide mouth with a cupid bow, posteriorly rotated ears. Results: The child was found through trio-based genome sequencing to carry a de novo missense SOX4 (NM_003107.3) variant c.176_177delinsAA (p.Ile59Lys). That variant was never reported, but a de novo variant affecting the same amino-acid (c.176T>G p.Ile59Ser) was reported in a French child presenting with mild learning difficulties, deep-set eyes, infra-orbital grooves, upturned nares, wide mouth with cupid bow and full lips, mild 5th finger clinodactyly, and dysplastic 5th toenails (Zawerton et al.

He had no fever, sore throat, cough, breathing difficulty or anosmia. He displayed a weight gain of 8kg since the onset of swelling. On physical examination he had a bodyweight of 73kg(5075p), height of 179cm(75-90p), blood pressure of 150/ 92mmHg(>95p+12). He had periorbital and +4 pretibial pitting edema. Respiratory sounds were poorly heard in bilateral basal areas. He had scrotal edema. His parents were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection 3weeks ago. The other 2 siblings living together in the same house did not have any symptoms related to COVID. Laboratory tests revealed urea 33mg/dL, creatinine 0.8mg/dL, albumin 1.8g/dL, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were high. Urine analysis revealed protein (+4), and urine microscopy showed dysmorphic erythrocytes. Urine protein was 16g/ day. Serology revealed normal serum complements and negative levels for ANA. The covid-19 test with PCR was negative. The COVID-19 IgM and IgG ELISA antibody test was positive. Results: Renal biopsy was performed. He had tip variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis on renal biopsy. Immunofluorescence studies revealed only segmental +1/+2 mesangial granular IgM deposition in the basement membrane.

1938,"Introduction: Cardiovascular sistem (CVS) complications are the most important causes of mortality and morbidity in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Renalase is a monoamin oxidase which is released from the kidney and degrades circulating catecholamines and regulated by renal function, amount of catecholamine. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for CVS complications in children with CKD and evaluate the relationship between risk factors and renalase. Material and methods: Children who were diagnosed as CKD (n:108) with GFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and healthy children (n:50) were included in the study. Patients with CKD were divided into stage 3-4 CKD (n:50), haemodialysis (HD) (n:14) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) (n:44) groups. Renelase levels were measured by ELISA Biotek ELx800 (USA). Results: The median value of renalase was measured 30.28 ng/ml (17.7339.6) in healthy volunteers, 27.4 ng/ml (15.65-37.94) in stage 3-4 CKD, 23.45 ng/ml (15.85-34.71) in HD patients, and 21.17 ng/ml (17.11-33.24) in PD patients. Renalase levels were found to be lower in CKD, but there was no significant correlation with CKD (p,""0.185). The patients were evaluated in terms of cardiovascular risk factors. 15.7% hypertension (HT), 38.9% hypoalbuminemia, 67.6% anemia, 49.1% hypercholesterolemia, 38% hypertriglyceridemia, 13.9% CRP elevation and 1.9% obesity were detected. When the cardiovascular risk factors were evaluated according to groups; hypoalbuminemia (70.5%), anemia (88.6%), total cholesterol (70.5%) and LDL elevation (68.2%) were most common in the PD group, hyperparathyroidism was seen mostly in the stage 3-4 CKD group (74%) and hypertrigiliseridemia (57.1%) was most frequent in the HD group (p <0.05). There was no correlation between hematological and biochemical parameters and renalase levels. Conclusions: Cardiovascular risk factors such as anemia, hypoalbuminemia and hyperlipidemia were found to be increased in children with CKD, but there was no significant relationship between blood renalase levels and cardiovascular risk factors.""",1.0,disease,True

We aimed to identify the clinical course, kidney outcomes and prognosis in children with HSK. Material and methods: We retrospectively analyzed of 46 children with HSK who were followed-up in our center. We reviewed medical records of children with HSK and recorded demographic features, clinical course, laboratory and radiological data of the patients. Results: The mean age of 46 children was 122±55.6 months. Twenty children (43.5%) were male and 26 children (56.5%) were female. The median age at diagnosis was 40 (1-180) months. The median age at diagnosis was found lower in male patients than female patients (13.5 months vs 54 months) (p,""0.022). Parental consanguinity was found in 18 (39.1%) patients. While 13 (28.3%) patients were coincidentally diagnosed with ultrasonography, the second most common presenting symptom (21.7%) was UTI.

1953,"Introduction: Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (FBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired glucose liver homeostasis and proximal renal tubules dysfunction. It is caused by defects in the glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) encoded by SLC2A2 gene. Clinical manifestations of FBS include acidosis, fasting hypoglycemia, postprandial hyperglycemia, and severe growth disorder. There are limited data on optimal nutritional therapy and a lack of comprehensive clinical evaluation in FBS-treated patients. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a diet with extended release waxy-maize cornstarch (ERWMC) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on metabolic response and growth. Material and methods: We report three cases with FBS treated in Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos with uncooked corn starch (UCCS) or ERWMC (Glycosade®), carbohydrate-controlled diet and applied CGM system (FreeStyle Libre 2, Abbott) using a smartphone. Results: Patient 1 glycemic control with UCCS and carbohydratecontrolled diet showed slow but steady growth (height always about 9 cm below 3rd percentile of height by age), no significant decrease in liver length or lipid changes. Growth retardation (height growth from 2 cm below 3rd percentile of height by age at 3 months to -20 cm below 3rd percentile of height by age at 4 years) and metabolic changes were most prominent for Patient 2 due to lack of parental compliance to the prescribed diet and UCCS assignments regime. Adequate growth, 14 mm decrease in liver length and positive lipid changes (reduction of total cholesterol by 1.5 mmol/l) have been observed in Patient 3 after the introduction of ERWMC and CGM system. Conclusions: For Patients with FBS a CGM system can be a useful tool to dose ERWMC, to choose food properly and to keep normal glycemia around the clock to ensure good metabolic response and patient growth.",1.0,Clinical,True

Material and methods: We conducted a retrospective study between January 2003 and December 2021 on pediatric patients suffering from a condition requiring TPE at some point during the course of illness. Results: There were 44 patients (65% females) included, with a median age of 146.5±52 months at the time of therapy. The median length of hospitalization was 14.5±43 days in the Nephrology Department/ICU. 40 (90%) of the disorders were included in categories for which TPE is accepted as first- or second-line therapy, with donor fresh frozen plasma as the only replacement fluid. A total of 169 TPE procedures were performed, with a median of 4, the apheresis schedule being determined by the patients condition. The kidney and the nervous system were the most affected organs (17 and 16, respectively), most of them requiring adjunctive immunosuppressive therapy.

In our hospital, RS was performed more than 6 months after all febrile UTI. After 2018, new criteria were applied, and RS was only performed in atypical or recurrent UTI or when abnormalities in renal ultrasonography (RUS) were found. Our aim was to analyse all RS to evaluate the new criteria adequacy. Material and methods: Retrospective study of patients diagnosed with UTI from 2011 to 2020 that underwent RS. Analysis of the new criteria adequacy and their correlation with the RS results. Altered RS was defined as presence of renal scars or renal differential function above 10%. Results: In this study, 232 children were included. Their median age at the UTI was 14 months old and 60% were female. Infection with nonEscherichia coli pathogens was identified in 17% of the cases and 22% of children had recurrent UTI. Abnormal findings were identified in 7% of the RUS. From the 83 RS performed according to the new criteria, 22 were altered (27%), while in the 149 RS that would not be performed, 18 (12%) were altered. The relation between the new criteria to perform RS and altered RS was statistically significative (p<0.05), with an odds ratio of 2.6 (1.3-5.2). Considering each criterion individually, the relations between recurrent or atypical UTI and altered RS were not statistically significative, while between abnormal findings in RUS and altered RS was statistically significative (p<0.05). Conclusions: We verified that the new criteria increase the probability of altered RS and avoid the realization of a significant number of unjustified RS. However, even in the absence of criteria, a percentage of lesions can be identified. More studies are needed to clarify the impact of these lesions in children's prognosis.",1.0,case,True

1978,"Introduction: Antenatal hydronephrosis represents a wide spectrum of urinary anomalies, ranging from transient hydronephrosis to urinary tract obstruction or vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Several grading systems have been used, of which the diameter of anteroposterior renal pelvis, classification of SFU (Society of Fetal Urology) and UTD (Urinary tract dilatation) are the most common ones. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of children with antenatal and early postnatal hydronephrosis, to assess the relation of hydronephrosis severity with definitive diagnosis and to compare hydronephrosis grading systems. Material and methods: This retrospective study included all cases of hydronephrosis diagnosed antenatally from 2013 to 2019. Minimum follow up was six months. Results: A total of 180 children (141 boys) were included in the study; 21% had ureteropelvic junction obstruction, 14% had vesicoureteral reflux, 5% had posterior urethral valve, and 2% had ureterocele. The incidence of ureteropelvic junction obstruction increased with increasing grades with all hydronephrosis grading systems. However, there were no correlation between the presence of vesicoureteral reflux and grade of hydronephrosis. Parenchymal changes on ultrasonography were also important for the diagnosis of obstructive uropathy independent of the severity of hydronephrosis. The incidence of urinary tract infection was significantly higher in children with urinary anomalies than children with transient hydronephrosis or non-obstructive dilatation (p <0.001). For predicting urinary tract abnormality; classification of anteroposterior diameter had 85.3% sensitivity and 71.3% specificity, classification of SFU had 94.1% sensitivity and 52.8% specificity, classification of UTD had 83.8% sensitivity and 79.6% specificity. Conclusions: Antenatal and postnatal US are sensitive tools for detecting hydronephrosis. Children with moderate and severe hydronephrosis have a high risk of having severe uropathies.

1983,"Introduction: To date, it has been proven that kidney damage in children with JIA is characterized by a subclinical course and often remains undiagnosed. With a duration of JIA for more than three years, the patients were found to have proteinuria, a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate and the concentration function of the kidneys. According to the results of a retrospective cohort study, it was found that 8% of children with JIA at 65 months from the onset of the disease have arterial hypertension or minimal proteinuria. The authors found that the main risk factor for the development of kidney damage in these patients was long-term exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and methotrexate in active forms of the disease. Material and methods: 80 children from JIA were examined. The age of the subjects was 10.4 ± 4.41 (10.6-15.0) years. Girls - 46 (57.5%), boys - 34 (42.5%). The debut of JIA was noted at the age of 5.8 ± 4.14 (4.9; 2.9) years. Children were distributed according to the clinical course of JIA: systemic arthritis - 9 (11.3%), polyarthritis - 47 (58.8%), oligoarthritis - 24 (30.0%). All patients at the time of examination were receiving a pain-modifying drug (methotrexate), and a history of (Plaquenil and Delagil) 31 (38.8%) patients. During the examination period, 22 (27.5%) patients received NSAIDs, 25 (31.3%) patients received immunobiological therapy. The urinary TGF-1 is a solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the sandwich principle. Results: On average TGF- 1 was 20.26 ± 16.34 (14.02; 12.5-17.98) pg/ ml. The level of TGF- 1 was significantly higher when comparing the group with polyarthritis and the combined group of patients for oligoarthritis or systemic arthritis: 23.02 ± 18.773 (15.08; 12.72-24.48) versus 16.34 ± 11.203 (13.5; 12.19-14.66) pg / ml, p<0.01. In patients with high JIA activity, the level of the urinary marker TGF-1 was significantly higher than 29.15 ± 34.198 (15.21; 14.02- 37.95) in comparison with patients in remission 18.92 ± 15.041 (13.44; 12.18-15.31), p<0.05. The dependence of the level of the urinary marker TGF-1 on the treated JIA was also noted. Thus, patients receiving NSAIDs have significantly higher levels of TGF-1 25.97 ± 20.430 (17.69; 14.84-27.88) than children who did not receive NSAIDs at the time of examination 18.10 ± 14.105 (13.4; 12.18-15.01), p<0.001. When using immunobiological drugs, a significant difference was noted in the reference values of the renal marker TGF-1. In the group of children receiving immunobiological therapy at the time of examination, the level of TGF-1 was significantly lower than 14.76 ± 5.994 (12.92; 12.04-14.05) than in the group not receiving immunobiological drugs 22.76 ± 18.823 (14.4; 13.32-22.15), p<0.01. Conclusions: Urinary excretion of TGF-1 in children with JIA is associated with high activity of the underlying disease. The use of NSAIDs is accompanied by a significant increase in the excretion of TGF-1 in the urine. In patients receiving immunobiological drugs, the content of TGF-1 in urine was significantly lower.",1.0,clinical,True

Material and methods: 14 children (9M/5F) aged 5.0 (2.0; 7.0) years with homozygous (n,4) and compound heterozygous (n,10) SLC34A1/SLC34A3 mutations were examined. The median age at the first examination in patients with IIH2 (n,""6, 3M/3F) was 4.0 (2.0; 5.0) years; in children with HHRH (n"",""8, 6M/2F) was 6.5 (2.5; 9.0) years, p"",""0.22. Molecular genetic analysis was performed in all children by NGS. Results: Among patients with IIH2 medullary nephrocalcinosis (NC) was revealed in 6/6 (100%), decreased TmP/GFR level in 4/6 (66.6%), bone deformation and hypercalciuria in 2/6 (33.3%), hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, increased serum ALP, decreased serum PTH, urolithiasis in 1/6 (16.6%) children. Patients with HHRH had hypercalciuria in 8/8 (100%), increased serum ALP, decreased serum PTH and TmP/ GFR levels, NC in 7/8 (87.5%), bone deformation in 6/8 (75%), hypophosphatemia in 4/8 (50%), hypercalcemia and urolithiasis in 2/8 (25%) subjects. Serum level of 1.25(OH)D3 was within normal range in all children with IIH2 and HHRH.

1999,"Introduction: Defects in the BCS1L gene is the most frequent cause of mitochondrial complex III deficiencies. The two major phenotypes associated with disease-causing variants in BCS1L are GRACILE (MIM #603358) (growth restriction, aminoaciduria, cholestasis with iron overload in the liver, lactic acidosis and early death) and Björnstad (MIM #262000) (brittle hair and sensorineural hearing loss) syndromes. Material and methods: The aim of the study was to present a child with isolated Fanconi syndrome due to mutation in the BCS1L gene. Results: The girl was born from non-consanguineous parents with birth weight 2900 g and height 49 cm. Her growth and developmental milestones were appropriate until the age of 1 year. At the age of 1.2 years the child presented with failure to thrive and windswept deformities of the knee. At first admission at the age of 4 years the girl had full-blown Fanconi syndrome including polyuria (3.5 L/m2 per day), phosphaturia with decreased TmP/eGFR (0.4 mmol/mmol), glycosuria (4+), low molecular weight proteinuria with high urinary -2 microglobulin level (15.4 mg/L), increased of fractional excretion of uric acid (53%), potassium (42%) and sodium (3%), aminoaciduria, metabolic acidosis (pH 7.3, HCO3- 17 mmol/l), short stature (height 87 cm (<3 pc), weight 11.2 kg (<3 pc)) and rickets (windswept deformities of the knee, metaphyseal fraying, widening of growth plates and severe osteomalacia). Her eGFR was 72.2 ml/min/1.73 m2. Kidney ultrasound revealed medullary nephrocalcinosis grade 2. Neurological and glycaemic status, liver function and serum lactate level were normal. The slit-lamp examination did not show any cystine crystals in the cornea. Audiometrically her hearing was normal. MRI of the brain was normal. NGS revealed compound heterozygous mutations c.439C>T in exon 3 and c.424A>G in exon 3 of BCS1L gene. The girl was treated with L-Carnitine (52 mg/kg/d), phosphate supplements (35.4 mg/kg/d), calcitriol (40 ng/kg/ d) and sodium bicarbonate (6.5 mEq/kg/d). 12-month therapy leads to improvements in her growth (by 2.3 kg in weight and 9 cm in height), normalization of serum bicarbonate (HCO3- 24 mmol/l) and phosphate (1.37 mmol/l) levels and decreased clinical features of rickets. We did not reveal any multisystemic features of mitochondrial dysfunction. Conclusions: The mitochondrial dysfunction due to mutation in the BCS1L gene can presented with isolated Fanconi syndrome. BCS1Lrelated disease needs to be considered in non-classical phenotypes of the GRACILE and Björnstad syndromes, and this may improve early clinical recognition of the disease.",1.0,disease,True

Material and methods: Retrospective study of the paediatric UTI between 2011 and 2020. Collection of demographical data, causative pathogens, antibiotic susceptibility profile and analysis of the entire population and by age group (under 1 year old (yo), from 1 to 5 yo, 6 to 9 yo and over 9 yo). Results: During the time considered, 1311 UTI were confirmed. The median age of the patients was 5 yo and 79% were female. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (72%), Proteus spp. (13%), coagulase-negative Staphylococci (9%) and Klebsiella spp. (3%). All of them had a higher incidence in female patients, except for Klebsiella spp. Escherichia coli was the most frequent pathogen in all age groups. Proteus spp. infection was more common in the 1 to 5 yo group (63% of the infections by Proteus spp.) and 93% of the infections by coagulase-negative Staphylococci occurred in the over 9 yo group. The highest global resistance was to ampicillin (40%), followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (16%) and nitrofurantoin (13%). The resistance was 10% to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and 4% to cefuroxime and, from the main pathogens, Klebsiella spp. presented the highest resistance rates (26% to both). Conclusions: The most frequent pathogen involved in UTI is Escherichia coli as described in literature. The rate of resistance to cefuroxime remains low, supporting its use as an empirical therapy in cases of febrile UTI. New options for prophylactic antibiotics must be considered due to the high resistance rates to those currently used.",1.0,negative,True

2081,"Introduction: Hemoperitoneum is a usually benign problem of peritoneal dialysis (PD), which predominantly develops shortly after peritoneal catheter insertion and rarely in chronic PD state. Excluding peritonitis, this condition is commonly attributed to vascular damage by the peritoneal catheter with favorable outcome after administration of heparin-mixed dialysate flushing and infusion of cool dialysate. Significant abdominal hematoma has been rarely reported only in adult patients. Material and methods: A 19-years old adolescent on PD for 6 years presented acute abdominal pain localized on right iliac region and bloody peritoneal dialysate. Dialysate leucocyte cell count was negative, blood platelet count and coagulation test were normal. Due to persistent abdominal pain and acute blood hemoglobin level reduction of 3 mg/dl, abdominal CT scan was performed showing a retroperitoneal hematoma of 8.6 x 4.7 x 3.2 cm at the right paracolic gutter. After intravenous contrast injection, a small leakage of superior mesenteric vein was observed, possibly attributed to trauma by the peritoneal catheter. Results: The patient was initially treated with intraperitoneal antibiotics until the bacterial dialysate culture came out negative. Low molecular weight heparin was added in the peritoneal dialysate solutions and the patient remained on strict decubitus position. Blood hemoglobin level was stabilized, abdominal pain resolved, and effluent became clear within 7 days. CT scan performed one week later showed reduction of abdominal hematoma. The patient was discharged 10 days later. Conclusions: Although hemoperitoneum is a usually benign complication of pediatric chronic PD, significant abdominal hematoma should be excluded in case of persistent abdominal pain without laboratory evidence of peritonitis.",1.0,flu,True

Results: Although high-protein diets might cause glomerular hypertrophy and hyperfiltration and worsen proteinuria, adequate dietary energy and protein intake is of great importance, in order to reduce the risk of protein-energy malnutrition. 100-130 kcal/kg/day and 0.8g of protein/kg/ day seem to be adequate. Increase of protein intake by 1 gram for every gram of protein lost through the urine is suggested. Dietary saturated fat must be limited, while emphasis should be given on mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated fatty acids. Supplemental administration of cholecalciferol and calcium is suggested in cases of low levels of 25-OH-D3 and/or ionized calcium and/or elevated levels of PTH. In case of anemia, supplemental administration of vitamin B12 and iron is suggested. Supplemental administration of 10 mg/day zinc may reduce nephrotic syndromes relapse rate, whereas supplemental administration of magnesium reduces thrombosis risk. Dietary sodium intake shuld not exceed 35mg/kg/day, while water consumption should not exceed urine output plus insensible losses.

2107,"Introduction: We are presenting two case histories of female newborns, diagnosed prenatally with a megacystis and hydronephrosis. Foetal megacystis usually indicates a lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO); in males most commonly due to posterior urethral valves. A LUTO in females is rare, with a urethral stenosis being the leading differential. Material and methods: Patient A was diagnosed in week 12 of pregnancy and underwent further investigations including a detailed ultrasound scan and genetic analysis. Patient B was found to have a megacystis, hydronephrosis and dilated bowel loops prenatally, no additional investigations were performed. Both patients had a vesico-amniotic shunt placed, despite normal amniotic fluid volumes. Results: Patient A was born by caesarean section at 37+4 weeks. She was noted to have a sinus urogenitalis, a ventrally displaced anus and a uterus duplex. Renal function was normal, the hydronephrosis resolved following suprapubic catheter insertion. A micturating cysto-urethrogram showed grade II-III vesicoureteral reflux. The infant was diagnosed with an anorectal/urogenital malformation syndrome; a correction operation was performed at the age of 7 months. Patient B was born by vaginal delivery at 39+4 weeks. On day three, she developed an ileus requiring surgery. An enlarged bladder and bowel malrotation were seen intraoperatively and a stoma was formed.

2113,"Introduction: The NR3C1 gene, which encodes the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor, has been shown to affect glucocorticoid receptor expression, function, and sensitivity to steroid therapy. The findings of studies evaluating the clinical significance of NR3C1 gene variants and their association with steroid responsiveness in children with nephrotic syndrome (NS) are different from each other. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance and the relationship between steroid responsiveness and NR3C1 gene variants' distrubitions in children with NS. Material and methods: Demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory data, and NR3C1 c.-13-6284C>T (rs10052957) and c.2298T>C (rs6196) variants of paitents were evaluated. The patients were classified as SSNS (steroid-sensitive NS), SDNS (steroid-dependent NS) and FRNS (frequently relapsing NS) and SRNS (steroid-resistant NS). Results: A total of and 45 healthy children and 123 patients, 49 (39.8%) of these were girls, with a mean age at diagnosis of 12,4 (3,0819,8) years and a median follow-up period of 6,08 (1-18,83) years were included in the study. Sixty-three patients were diagnosed with SRNS, 35 with SSNS, 17 with SDNS, and 8 with FRNS; Sixty of patients were steroid-responsive. The rs10052957 and rs6196 variants were distributed similarly in both the patient and control groups, steroid-resistant and steroid-responsive patients. Furthermore, the rs10052957 and rs6196 variant distributions were not different between clinical subgroups (SSNS, SDNS, FRNS and SRNS). The frequency of rs10052957-CT variants was significantly lower in SSNS patients than in non-SSNS patients. In the patients wtih hypertension at diagnosis, the frequency of the rs10052957-T pathogenic allele was higher than in the group without hypertension. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the NR3C1 gene rs10052957 and rs6196 variants were not associated with the steroid responsiveness in children with NS, although the rs10052957-T allele was significantly more frequent in patients with hypertension at the time of diagnosis.",1.0,clinical,True

We aimed to determine the etiological factors, to examine the clinical features and renal prognosis of children with hypocitraturia in our center. Material and methods: We retrospectively analyzed of 59 children with hypocitraturia who were diagnosed and followed-up in our center. We reviewed medical records of patients with hypocitraturia and recorded demographic features, clinical course, laboratory and radiological data of the patients. Results: Thirty-six (61%) of patients were male. The median age at diagnosis was 4 (0-11) months. The median follow-up period was 30 (1-171) months. The median age of patients was 9 (1.5-18.5) years. Primary diagnosis of 49 (83.1%) patients were nephrolithiasis, of 4 (6.8%) patients were distal renal tubular acidosis, of two (3.4%) patients were primary hyperoxaluria type 1, of one (1.7%) patient was Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and of one patient (1.7%) was cystinuria.

However, despite this, there are reports of recurrence even in undeniably genetically determined cases (NPHS2 compound heterozygous, for example). There is no explanation of that phenomenon because its considered that FSGS recurrence is mainly circulating plasma factor associated. Material and methods: We analyzed histories of 25 of 135 children with hereditary NS who underwent kidney transplantation. Results: Among transplanted patients, there were children with causative mutations in NPHS2 gene (7 children - 28%), NPHS1, WT1 and SMARCAL1 (3 children - 12% each), NUP93 and ARHGAP24 (2 children - 8% each) and INF2, PLCE1, MYH9 and children with co-regulation and co-expression of two genes - NPHS2 + LMX1B and NUP93 + TRPC6 (1 child - 4% each). The mean age was 9 yr 10 m, SD 44.6 m. The mean onset age was 21 m, SD 30.8 m. In the onset, only four children had isolated NS or proteinuria, 17 - high blood pressure, and 13 - hematuria. Twenty children had a history of steroid therapy, all of them demonstrated resistance. In addition, 17 patients received therapy with calcineurin inhibitors, and only one child achieved partial remission after two months of the treatment. The average age of ESRD was 79.3 m (SD 50.3 m). Seven children initially started peritoneal dialysis, 6 - hemodialysis, 6 - had an experience of both of them, and 6 underwent preemptive kidney transplantation without efferent kidney replacement therapy methods. Only seven children got a deceased donor kidney transplantation. The FSGS recurrence in the graft was verified in 3 children (NS with causative mutations in NPHS2, MYH9, ARHGAP24).

Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is found in 30% to 40% of children with UTI; reflux, especially of higher grades, increases the risk of recurrent UTIs and renal scarring, with associated sequelae in later life (proteinuria, hypertension, eclampsia and end-stage renal disease). Aim: Assessing the need to perform voiding urosonography as a screening method for VUR in young children with UTIs. Material and methods: Renal ultrasounds were performed on 179 patients with UTIs hospitalized during April 2019 -December 2020.The patients were aged between 0.4 months - 10 years, with an average of 3 years ±2.8 months. Of these, 109 patients (60.9%) had a normal renal ultrasound report. Results: Patients with history of more than 2 infections (58 patients 32.5%) underwent voiding urosonography. Secondary VUR due to posterior urethral valve was found in 6 patients. 32 patients had grade 3, 4 or 5 VUR, and were transferred to the surgery department. 15 (25.8%) patients detected with reflux had no pelvic or distal ureteral dilatation on renal ultrasound.

Material and methods: We retrospectively analysed the medical records of children hospitalized due to SSNS in one pediatric nephrology unit between 2012-2019. Demographic data, clinical symptoms at the onset of NS and laboratory parameters were compared between patients with and without VTEC. Results: Among 106 children with first episode of SSNS, in five VTEC were diagnosed during 2-60 days after onset of NS, on the basis of clinical symptoms and/or results of imaging studies. These were thromboses of femoral vein, central part of the kidney, dorsal veins of the hand, venous sinuses of the brain, and superficial vein in the popliteal fossa region. We found significant higher serum fibrinogen level (P, 0.022) and D-dimers (P,""0.0001) in children with VTEC versus without VTEC, but AUC analysis showed that only D-dimers significantly differentiate thrombosis. The clinical risks factors of VTEC were vascular cannulation(100%), infections(80%), diuretics(80%). In children with VTEC, low molecular weight heparin was used. The outcome was a full recovery in all patients. Conclusions: VTEC occurs in 4.72% of children with first episode of SSNS. The course of VTEC in children with SSNS may be asymptomatic. The clinical risk factors of VTEC in children with SSNS are vascular cannulation, infections, and diuretics. High D-dimers level is sensitive indicator of thrombosis.""",1.0,clinical,True

2175,"Introduction: ""Acute Kidney Injury"" or AKI (AKI) is a common condition in intensive care units (ICUs). Patients with AKI have a very high mortality and survivors after suffering from it, are at risk of chronic kidney damage. Proximal tubular function has been poorly studied in patients admitted to pediatric ICU Material and methods: We studied 38 patients (21V,17M) admitted successively to the Pediatric ICU of our hospital. None of them were diagnosed with AKI. Their age was 49.7±46.8 months (range: 0-159) and the days of stay, 6.9±5.3 days (range: 2-26). The most frequent etiology was respiratory failure (n,""18), infectious (n"",6) and neurological (n,4) causes and control after surgery (n,""4). All patients except on had a PRIMS III score of less than 20. 81.6% (31/38) showed a """"renal angina index"""" (AARI) score of less than 8. Results: At discharge, 26/38 patients (68.4%) had elevated tubular proteinuria (both ratios (n"",""14), 2-microglobulin/Cr (n"",7) or NAG/Cr (n,5)). The calcium/creatinine ratio was increased in 56.1% of cases (23/37) and the albumin/creatinine ratio was elevated in 25% (9/36). Children with tubular proteinuria showed significantly lower Na+ levels at admission (p,0.03) and higher EfNa at discharge (p,""0.002), compared to those without tubular proteinuria. There was no relationship between the latter and the calcium/creatinine ratio, but between the NAG/ creatinine ratio and the use of nephrotoxicants (p"",0.03). The IAR values were not correlated with the parameters of glomerular function (at admission and discharge) but with those of the NAG/creatinine ratios (r,""0.72, p<0.001) and 2-microglobulin/creatinine (r"",""0.75, p<0.001). In two patients, the value of the GFRe was less than 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 with the two formulas used and, in four others, they did not coincide; none received nephrotoxic drugs. Conclusions: In patients admitted to our pediatric ICU, we observed at discharge, two apparently independent renal anomalies, namely proximal tubular proteinuria (56.1%) and high calcium/creatinine ratio (59.5%) (immobilization?). Tubular proteinuria was accompanied by saline loss. Urinary elimination of NAG was related to the use of nephrotoxicants. Hyponatremia on admission is likely to favor the appearance of tubular proteinuria. The number of children with reduced GFRe at discharge was very low.""",1.0,respiratory,True

The aimof the study was to compare the etiology and antibiotic resistance of bacteria causing UTI in children hospitalised in a specialistic tertiary reference centre with pediatric, nephrology, urology and ICU departments. Material and methods: We analysed all positive urine specimens (>,""100000 CFU/ml) reported by the hospital microbiology unit in a period of 24 months collected in tertiatry pediatric reference centre with 2 pediatric, 1 nephrology, 1 urology and 2 ICU departments. For the further analysis only those children with clinically confirmed UTI were qualified (515 specimens). The medical files were retrieved with regard to specific clinical data (f.e. gender, presence of CAKUT, clinical symptoms, length of hospitalisation). Urine culture was analysed for bacterial strain identification and standard method of antibiotic resistance according to EUCAST recommendations. Results: E coli was detected in 44% of cases and was predominant in all of the departments, followed by Klebsiella(14%) and Enterococcus (13%) and Pseudomona aeruginosa (11%). When all children with/no CAKUT were analysed only incidence of Candida sp (0.5-4.4%, p"",""0.011) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.7% vs 5.6%, p"",""0.002) was higher in the former. However, when the distribution of species between departments differed significantly showing that in non-CAKUT children ICU stay was connected with lowest E.coli and highest P.aeruginosa, Enterococcus and Klebsiella sp. incidence (p<0.025). In CAKUT patients, urology and ICU showed significantly lower incidence of E.coli (25-37 vs 45-66%; p<0.001). When the resistance to standard antibiotic was analysed (detailed data will be available on poster), we detected that susceptibility of Klebsiella, P.aeruginosa, E.coli differed between analysed units (p<0.001) with pICU specimens mostly responsible for the difference. Boys and girls had different species distribution with lower incidence of E.coli and higher of Klebsiella sp., P.aeruginosa and Staphylococcus. (p<0.035). Conclusions: Hospitalisation in pICU and urology department, male gender and presence of CAKUT suggested different distribution of etiology (increase in incidence of other G(-)) bacteria and higher resistance to standard set of antibiotics. Thus, we postulate that empriric therapy for UTI in pediatric tertiary reference centre should differ between urology/ICU and other unit patients and CAKUT/non-CAKUT children.""",1.0,positive,True

Demographic data, clinic and pathologic findings, treatment, and outcome data were evaluated. Results: The mean age and follow-up duration was 8.4±4.6 and 6.2±4.2 years, respectively. The median time from transplantation to diagnosis of PTLD was 1.1 (0.48-9.6) years. Five patients (33.3 %) were seronegative for EBV VCA IgG at the time of KTx. The most common symptom was loss of appetite. The lymph nodes and central nervous system were involved in seven and five patients, respectively. Polymorphic PTLD was the most common type of PTLD. Reduction or withdrawal of immunosuppression (73%) was the most common treatment modality for PTLD. Switching from MMF to mTOR inhibitors was performed in six and rituximab (RTX) was administered to 13 patients. Chemotherapy (RCHOP) was given to six patients, radiotherapy to three patients, and surgery was performed in two patients. Seven patients (47%) achieved complete remission and five patients (33%) died from PTLD. Nine patients were alive with functioning grafts. There was no statistical significance between surviving and deceased patients in terms of EBV viral load before PTLD or at diagnosis, recipient age, or eGFR at the last visit. Mortality was not associated with any organ involvement, clinical presentation, or laboratory findings at the time of PTLD diagnosis. Conclusions: Although survival rates in kidney transplantation have increased due to immunosuppressive treatments, PTLD still remains as a serious complication that causes death in a significant rate of patients.

This is most likely related to increase in primary hypertension, but secondary hypertension is still prevalent. Material and methods: Here we present a patient who was diagnosed with AME syndrome, an endocrinological cause of secondary hypertension, and was also diagnosed with Coffin-Siris syndrome with dysmorphic features. Results: A 6-month old girl was admitted to a hospital with the complaints of failure to thrive, intermittent vomiting and polyuria. She was born to first-degree consanguineous parents. The patient had body weight and height SDS's were -1.6 and -1.31, respectively. She was normotensive. She had hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with normal kidney functions and increased urine output and hypercalciuria. Urinary ultrasound showed medullary nephrocalcinosis. With the diagnosis of Bartter syndrome, oral potassium and indomethacin were commenced. She was noticed to be asymptomatically hypertensive [BP: 128/ 78 mmHg (>99th and 98th percentile)] for the first time in her control at the age of 7.4 years. The BP percentiles from 2.5 to 7.4 years of age are demonstrated in Table 1.

Therefore, there is a need to develop sensitive methods for early diagnosis of kidney damage, inflammation and fibrosis. The aim was to evaluate the relationship between urine biomarkers and renal scarring in children with VUR. Material and methods: 117 patients aged 3 to 16 years (mean age 10.2 ± 4.5, 70.1% of girls) with VUR were examined. The control group consisted of 40 healthy children. All children underwent a complete nephrological examination. The levels of transforming growth factor (TGF-1) and angiotensin II (Ang II), microalbumin (MA) were determined in morning urine using the ELISA method. To identify the severity of the lesion of the renal parenchyma, a static DMSA scan was performed. According to DMSA, the children were divided into 3 groups: 1 gr. - VUR without signs of sclerosis (15.4%), 2 gr. - VUR+1-2 foci (44.74%) and 3 gr VUR+ > 3-4 foci of sclerosis (40.1%). Results: All patients with VUR had a high urinary excretion of all biomarkers when compared with the control group (p<0.05). The concentrations of all urine biomarkers were significantly higher in the gr.2 and gr.3 than gr.1 (p<0.0001). TGF-1, Ang II and MA were correlated with renal scars. The same urine biomarkers also correlated with GFR. Conclusions: DMSA renal scan, showed a direct correlations with the severity of VUR. We established a reliable dependence of the excretion biomarkers in the urine on the severity of RN according to DMSA scan in children with VUR.

Results: One hundred and sixty-one patients with ;monosymptomatic enuresis (MNE) and 86 patients with nonmonosymptomatic enuresis (NMNE) were enrolled in this study. The patients with MNE were significantly older than the patients with MNE (9.0 ± 2.5 vs 7.6 ± 2.4 years; p,<0.001). The proportion of females was significantly higher in the NMNE group (54.7% vs 40.4%; p,0.032). The hemoglobin level was significantly lower in the NMNE group (12.8 ± 0.8 vs 13.4 ± 1.0 g/dl; p,0.05). The univariable analyses using the aboveidentified parameters showed that a relatively low mean hemoglobin level was a risk factor for NMNE (OR,""-0.603, 95% CI 0.346-0.867; p"",0.01). Conclusions: Making the differential diagnosis of MNE and NMNE and determining the risk factors earlier in disease course are essential tasks to be accomplished in the initial evaluation of patients with enuresis. Relatively low Hb levels may be novel risk factor for NMNE.",1.0,symptomatic,True

2278,"Ghent University Hospital Introduction: Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is a common cause of antenatal detected persistent hydronephrosis. However, only in 2-5% of cases UPJO is bilateral, the majority occurs in boys (male-tofemale ratio ,"" 13:1). Material and methods: Case: A female fetus followed for antenatal bilateral hydronephrosis suspected to be caused by bilateral UPJO, presented at 33 weeks gestation with acute severe oligohydramnios and no bladder filling. At the previous antenatal scan at 28 weeks gestation, there was no oligohydramnios and normal bladder filling noted. She was delivered at 34 weeks by Cesarean section, and bilateral UPJ obstruction was confirmed, together with anuria and renal failure. Percutaneous bilateral nephrostomies were performed with the eventual recovery of the diuresis. Both right and left kidney pyeloplasty were performed successfully with the recovery of renal failure. Moreover, on the left side beside an instrinsic UPJ-obstruction, a crossing blood vessel causing extrinsic UPJ-obstruction was identified. Results: Antenatally detected bilateral UPJO is rare and not well described in the literature. Acute severe oligohydramnios in these cases is unexpected. Since urine production recovered completely once the nephrostomies were in place, the reason for this sudden phenomenon of oligohydramnios remains speculative and can only be related to an increasing degree of obstruction relative to poor or decreasing excretory pressure. Conclusions: In conclusion, late-onset acute severe oligohydramnios can occur with bilateral UPJ obstruction.""",1.0,case,True

Results: A total of 14 children were included in our study including 10 sisters, 2 brothers and 2 first cousins. The mean age at diagnosis was 9.9 ±4.6 years (4-16 years). Three patients had ureterohydronephrosis on ultrasound, a diverticular bladder was found in 28.5% of cases, and a vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) was found in 21.42% of cases on retrograde urethrocystography. The debimetry curve was polyphasic in 78.57% of patients, the mean flow rate was 14.02± 5.7 ml (7.4 ml to 28.9 ml). 57.14% of the patients had a post-void residual (PVR) with a mean of 166.35±222.78 ml (70-800).

Material and methods: We present a patient of 16.5 years with TSC, pervasive developmental disorder, and multiple renal cysts. The diagnosis of TSC existed since the age of six months, manifesting clinically as West syndrome. Neuroimaging showed subependymal nodules and infra and supratentorial cortical tubers, partially calcified. At 13 years old, kidney cysts up to 2 cm in size and a liver right lobe subcapsular solitary cyst were sonographically detected and confirmed by MRI. At 14.5 years of age, the parameters of global renal function were normal, without proteinuria and hypertension. Based on the polycystic kidney disease imaging finding, ADPKD type without angiomyolipomatosis, the TSC2 / PKD1 contiguous gene deletion syndrome was suspected. A genetic center analyzed the TSC1, TSC2, and PKD1 genes and confirmed the diagnosis. Results: The result for the TSC1 gene detected no changes; for the TSC2 gene, Ex8: c.711_713delGCT, p. L238del (het); for PKD1 gene, Ex39: c.9499A> T, p.I3167F (het). Both mutations are classified as probably pathogenic (class 4), and that one, for the TSC2 gene, has never been described to date. Monitored by a multidisciplinary approach, there are no signs of renal function damage, hypertension, or extrarenal symptoms. Conclusions: Patients with TCS require evaluation of renal damage and recognition of rare pathological conditions such as TSC2 / PKD CGDS to detect and control the possible progressive renal impairment on time.",1.0,clinical,True

Material and methods: The medical charts of 95 children with CSK (January 1980 to December 2017) were reviewed. We collected the following data: gender, causes for first US, appearance of kidney on US, kidney length measurements, other congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), urinary tract infections (UTI), birth weight, age at last US, proteinuria, blood pressure, renoprotective treatment and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Results: Children with CSK were predominantly male (61%). Solitary kidney was discovered prenatally in 10/95 (10.5%) children, US due to UTI in 8/95 (8%), neonatal screening in 31/95 (32.3%), US as part of examinations for other congenital malformations, enuresis, urinary incontinence or abdominal pain in 31/95 (32.3%) children. Abnormal US appearance of solitary kidney was found in 9/95 (%) children. 11/95 (12%) children had length of kidney below 75pc. CAKUT was identified in 24/95 (25%) children. 26 (28%) children had UTI, 7/95 (7%) were born with low birth weight. Proteinuria was present in 14/91 (15%), arterial hypertension in 10/95 (11%) children (mean age of diagnosis 12.4 ± 2 years). 28/95 (29%) children were treated with ACE inhibitor. GFR (<70 mL/min/1.73m2) was found in 3 patients. Twenty-seven (28.6%) patients met the criteria for renal injury (presence of hypertension and/or proteinuria and/or significantly impaired eGFR). In univariate analysis, only age at last US check was a significant risk factor for renal injury (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 - 1.31, p<0.0001) and retained statistical significance in the multiple model (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07 - 1.33, p,""0.001).

2297,"Introduction: The widespread use of genetic tests has identified pathogenic variants in the genes affected in Alport syndrome(AS) in cohorts with other kidney phenotypes, including focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis(FSGS), steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome(SRNS), kidney failure of unknown cause, familial immunoglobulin A glomerulonephritis, and possibly cystic kidney disease. Material and methods: Thirteen pediatric patients with COL4A mutations from 11 families were recruited; 8 patients have a family history of renal disease; in 8 of the families other members were tested for the same variants found in the index patients. We analyzed the genotypephenotype correlations in our pediatric cohort and in the affected family members by indentifying the causative mutation and clinical and biological findings (hematuria, proteinuria, renal function, extrarenal features), but also histological data in these patients. Results: Mutations were present in COL4A3-30.7%(4), COL4A4- 30.7%(4) and COL4A5-38.4%(5 total,1 male). The male patient and his adult brother with X-linked AS have a severe phenotype (renal and extrarenal features) which correlates with the nonsense mutation identified in these cases, whereas the female carriers of X-linked AS demonstrate a phenotypic variability from microscopic to macroscopic hematuria, proteinuria and renal impairment. Individuals with 2 heterozygous mutations(30.7%-4 patients of the pediatric cohort and one adult family member) had a more severe phenotype than the ones with one heterozygous mutation(30.7%), presenting with nephrotic proteinuria(50% of the pediatric patients and the affected adult) and early-onset renal failure(ESKD at 17y and 27y respectively). Identified truncating variants(nonsense 7.69%, frameshifts 23.07%) and carboxi terminal missense mutations(7.69%) showed a more severe pattern of phenotypic manifestations, both renal and extrarenal. Variants affecting splicing apperead to cause a more severe renal outcome only when associated with additional heterozygous variants in COL4A genes. In our group, missense variants affecting glycine(30.7%) associated with early-onset renal failure only in one patient who had an additional heterozygous variant in COL4A3 gene. Heterozygous missense COL4A4 variant was identified in one patient with isolated FSGS and SRNS. Conclusions: Knowledge of the causative mutation often indicates the likely clinical course. Both genetic and non-genetic factors are likely to contribute to the observed phenotypic variability and they provide predictive information about disease severity and prognosis.",1.0,spread,True

Autoimmune pathologies that can be seen in patients with ALPS are hepatitis, uveitis, encephalitis, and less commonly, glomerulonephritis. Material and methods: Case: A 15-year-old girl, who was followed up with the diagnosis of ALPS, was consulted to the pediatric nephrology department because of swelling in the body. It was learned that the patient first presented with hemolytic anemia at the age of seven. Hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent lung infections were added to her clinic in the follow-up. She was diagnosed with ALPS, she used steroid, plasmapheresis, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and cyclosporine treatments. When she applied to the nephrology outpatient clinic with the complaint of diffuse swelling lasting for 15 days, she had not been taking immunosuppressive therapy for one year. In the physical examination of the patient, diffuse edema was found, and hypoalbuminemia (1.9 g/dl) and proteinuria at the nephrotic level (246 mg/m2/hour) were found in the examinations. Renal functions, complement 3 and 4 levels were normal, and there was no hematuria. Full house immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis (30% global sclerosis, 18% crescent) was found in the kidney biopsy which performed with the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Repeated ANA and anti ds-DNA tests for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) were negative, and the patient had no additional clinical findings suggestive of SLE. Pulse methylprednisolone (1 gram/day) was given for 3 days to the patient who did not respond to full-dose steroid treatment for four weeks. Intravenous cyclophosphamide was started to the patient who was still unresponsive to steroids at the sixth week, and enalapril was added to her treatment. In the follow-up, frequent albumin and furosemide infusions were required due to persistent edema and abdominal ascites, and severe pneumonia, cellulitis, and sepsis attacks occurred. Her treatment was continued with MMF. In the sixth month of MMF, she was unresponsive. A total of four doses of rituximab treatment were given with an interval of one week. MMF was continued after rituximab, but despite all treatments, remission was not achieved, severe proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia persisted. Therefore, immunosuppressive therapy was changed to cyclosporine. The patient was in partial remission (24 hour urine protein 40 mg/ m2/hour, albumin 3.5 g/dl) in the third month of cyclosporine treatment, and in complete remission (24 hour urine protein 4 mg/m2/hour, albumin 4.1 g/dl) in the sixth month. Results: Our patient is still under cyclosporine and low-dose prednisolone treatment, and is in complete remission and her kidney functions are normal. Conclusions: Glomerulonephritis is one of the autoimmune pathologies that rarely accompanies ALPS and has been rarely reported in the literature. Although full house pattern glomerulonephritis was detected in kidney biopsy, clinical and laboratory findings of SLE were not observed in our patient. In the literature, there are ALPS cases associated with the SLE clinic, as well as SLE cases with Fas-Fas Ligand mutations. In addition, unlike most of the cases of glomerulonephritis diagnosed with ALPS in the literature, our patient was steroid resistant and responded to cyclosporine treatment.

Material and methods: Case: A 14-year-old male patient who had BMT from his brother 2 months ago due to acute lymphoblastic leukemia,presented with vomiting and diarrhea. He showed signs of mild dehydration and laboratory findings showed urine density of 1031,protein of 2(+)on dipstick,creatinine of 0.57 mg/dL,BUN of 11 mg/dL,urea of 24 mg/dL and normal electrolytes.Vomiting and diarrhea was stopped but the gradual increase in creatinine persisted.Ultrasonography revealed bilateral increased echogenity in kidneys.Direct microscopic examination of urine showed morphic erytrocytes.24-hour urine test showed nephritic range,mixed type proteinuria of 575 mg/day(protein:17 mg/m2/h,microalbumin:163 mg/day).Cyclosporine treatment,which was planned to be discontinued one month later,was discontinued early due to the gradual increase in creatinine.C3,C4 were normal.EBV,CMV PCR tests and ANA was negative.Urinary BKV load was 52.891 copy/ml,blood BKV load was 91 copy/ml.Renal biopsy was performed and while waiting for the pathology results,oral ciprofloxacin was started.Biopsy showed inflammatory cell infiltration including eosinophils and granulomas in the tubulointerstitial area and diffuse tubulary injury which were consistent with BKVN.SV40 was positive in immune-histochemical staining.After 15 days,creatinine was 1.26 mg/dL,blood BKV was 27 copy/ml,urine BKV load was 198 copy/ml and urinary protein excretion decreased to 4 mg/m2/h. Conclusions: In the histology of BKVN; cytopathic changes, tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrotic changes are expected in BKV-infected areas.Classical granuloma formation is rare and reported in 1 out of 46 biopsies of BKVN.We wanted to draw attention to the fact that granulomatous nephropathy detected in the histopathological examinations of immunosuppressed patients who had kidney biopsy for AKI and/or proteinuria may be associated with BKVN.",1.0,asymptomatic,True

2359,"Introduction: Acid base balance is maintained by the kidney, via excretion of ammonium and titratable acids and bicarbonate reabsorption. Metabolic acidosis develops as kidney function deteriorates. Peritoneal dialysis is considered efficient in controlling metabolic acidosis. Metabolic alkalosis is uncommon in dialysis treated patients. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the rate of metabolic alkalosis in pediatric patients treated with peritoneal dialysis. Material and methods: Medical records of children treated with peritoneal dialysis in Shaare Zedek Medical Center from January 2000 to June 2021 were reviewed and compared with young adults currently treated with peritoneal dialysis. Demographic, clinical and peritoneal dialysis characteristics were extracted from the medical records. Results: Thirty chronic peritoneal dialysis patients were included in our study. Seven under 2 years, 13 between 2 and 18 years and 10 adults. 90.3% of the measurements in infants showed metabolic alkalosis compared to 32.3% in the 2-18 years group and none in the adult group. Higher size-adjusted daily exchange volume, lack of urine output and high lactate containing dialysate were associated with metabolic alkalosis. Alkalosis was not explained by vomiting, diuretic therapy or carbonate containing medications. High transport membrane, low dietary protein and malnutrition, all previously reported explanations for metabolic alkalosis, were not found in our study. Conclusions: Metabolic alkalosis is common in infants treated with peritoneal dialysis as opposed to older children and adults. High lactate containing dialysate and higher size-adjusted daily dialysate exchange volume are possible predictors. This finding, coupled with the higher mass transfer area coefficients previously found in infants, may reflect a higher solute transport capacity including bicarbonate absorption in this age group. Acid-base status should be closely followed in infants and using a dialysis solution with lower bicarbonate or lactate level should be considered.",1.0,clinical,True

We report the first case of a pediatric patient with UC and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with IgA deposits. Results: A 16-year-old with a recent history of UC and without extraintestinal manifestations, presented with a bilateral swelling in lower extremities and weight gain of 10 kg during two months. For UC, the patient was initiated on 5-aminosalicylate mesalamine and metronidazole for seven days. After 2 months of this regimen, he developed the edema.Further laboratory investigation showed significant hypoproteinemia (4,6 g/dl), hypoalbuminemia (2,3 g/dl) and the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 3,59 mg/mg associated with microscopic hematuria (8-10 pf). Blood pressure and renal function were normal. Renal ultrasonography disclosed no abnormalities. Normal levels of C3 and C4 were observed and no autoimmune factors were detected. Renal biopsy revealed a FSGS associated with mesangial IgA deposits. No signs of interstitial nephritis were found.Prednisone (PDN) 60 mg/m2 /day and ramipril 1,25 mg/day were initiated and mesalamine was stopped immediately. A rapid remission of the nephrotic syndrome (NS) was observed within 4 weeks of steroid therapy. After 6 months, PDN therapy was discontinued but it was transiently reintroduced due to relapse of gastrointestinal symptoms. Conclusions: In our patient, the appearance of NS during clinical remission of UC appears to exclude an extra-intestinal involvement of the UC and may suggest a role of Mesalamine. Mesangial IgA deposits could be secondary to chronic intestinal inflammation in this UC patient. It is unknown how mesalamine triggers FSGS, but the pathogenesis could be related to reversible podocyte toxicity.

2383,"Introduction: Dent disease is an X-linked recessive renal tubular disorder characterized by proximal tubule dysfunction. Typical features include low molecular weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, rickets, and chronic renal failure. The disease is caused by mutations in either the CLCN5 (Dent disease 1) or OCRL1 (Dent disease 2) genes. Material and methods: We present a case of a 6-year-old boy with nephrotic proteinuria without hypoalbuminemia or edema. His renal biopsy revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), some of the glomeruli were globally sclerotic. Hypercalciuria was present intermittently and urine protein electrophoresis showed low molecular weight protein fraction of 50%. The family history revealed that his maternal uncle was being followed-up for proteinuria of unknown etiology. Results: The next generation sequencing identified pathogenic variant in OCRL gene causing Dent disease type 2. The patient was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide at the dose of 1 mg/kg/day, ramipril 5 mg daily and phosphate supplementation. The patient has been followed up in good clinical condition for 3 years in total. Conclusions: This case report highlights the importance of a complex view of FSGS as a heterogeneous entity. The presence of only mildly elevated albuminuria in a child with nephrotic proteinuria should point to tubular disease. We report an uncommon histologic finding of FSGS in Dent disease type 2 and highlight the importance of protein content",1.0,disease,True

2389,"Introduction: Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare autosomal recessive ciliopathy, caused by at least 24 genes. It is manifested by various signs visible at birth, such as polydactyly, brachydactyly, and syndactyly. Other signs include obesity, metabolic syndrome, retinopathy, kidney, heart, gastrointestinal, neural, and genital abnormalities which usually develop over time. The prevalence of BBS is 1:100000 -1:13000, depending on geographic location. The most affected genes are BBS1 (51%), BBS10 (20%). Material and methods: Our patients were a male newborn, his brother, and his sister. They were tested with a gene panel for ciliopathic genes. Results: The proband was newborn, born in 38th gestational week, with Apgar score 10/10, BW 3200 g, and BL 49 cm. During pregnancy, 1st gynecological ultrasound revealed renal pelvis dilatation, hexadactyly of the right hand and both feet, and syndactyly of 2nd and 3rd fingers. In addition, patent foramen ovale, enlarged and hyperechoic kidneys with a large number of small macrocysts, liver hyperechoic bile ducts, and mildly condensed left lung with lots of B-lines were observed. Based on those findings, we suspected autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease. On the 15th day of life, 2nd ultrasound revealed that only changes in kidneys remained present. His older brother (18 months) also had polycystic kidneys and the same type of hexadactyly and syndactyly, while their older sister (5 years) additionally had hydrometrocolpos and hydronephrosis at birth. We suspected that proband and his siblings have clinical phenotypes of overlapping symptoms of BBS and McKusick Kauffman syndrome. The testing of their panel genes confirmed two pathogenic missense variants, c.1277G>A (p.Cys426Tyr) and c.940A>G (p.Arg314Gly) in the BBS12 gene (each on opposite chromosomes) and supported a diagnosis of autosomal recessive BBS-12 (BBS12, MIM 615989).

Regression to normoalbuminuria in already albuminuric children calls into question albuminuria as an early indicator of diabetic kidney disease development. The aim of this study is to develop a clinically useful model based on the association of serum cystatin C, Doppler renal resistance index and kidney injury molecule-1 in urine with standard indicators of renal function in order to determine the optimal model for early detection of diabetic kidney disease. Material and methods: The study included 75 children with type 1 diabetes(T1D), normoalbuminuria and normal renal function aged 1018 years, and 75 healthy children in the control group. In both groups, we determined serum cystatin C, KIM- 1 in urine, renal resistance index(RI), lipidogram, thyroid hormones, serum creatinine, anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum uric acid, urine albumin / creatinine ratio ,and degree of pubertal development. Results: The results suggest that RI and urinary KIM-1 are higher in patients with T1D compared to the control group. In this study, RI is higher in affected children and is useful for assessing early hemodynamic changes in the preclinical phase of early renal impairment. Dyslipidemia, higher values of serum creatinine and insulin dose are associated with the increased risk of developing microalbuminuria and diabetic kidney disease.

2414,"Introduction: IgA nephropathy is a commonly reported glomerular disease in adults with liver disease, especially alcoholic liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis or portal hypertension. Although its prevalence in children is not known clearly. The pathogenesis is characterized by the disruption in the clearance of circulating immune complexes by Kupffer cells which cause the immune complexes to accumulate in the kidneys. Material and methods: We present a patient with portal hypertension who developed IgA nephropathy. Results: 8-year old boy who was diagnosed as non-cirrhotic portal hypertension at the age of 4 and using propranolol applied to hospital because of recurrent gross hematuria. Physical examination showed only splenomegaly. Laboratory analysis showed bicytopenia, normal kidney functions and normal liver enzymes. Urinalysis was positive for blood and dysmorphic red blood cells were seen with no red cell casts on microscopy. There was minimal range proteinuria. Ophthalmological examination and hearing test were normal. His serum complement levels were mildly decreased; C3 and C4 were at 71.9 mg/dl (79-152) and 11 mg/dl (16-38), respectively. Ultrasonography showed splenomegaly, but kidneys were normal in size and echogenicity, and renal doppler was normal. In portal system doppler, cavernous transformation in the portal vein was detected with the hepatopedal direction of the portal vein. Cystoscopy was performed and no focus was observed. Repeated liver biopsy showed near-normal histology; the diagnosis of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension was confirmed. Kidney biopsy was performed; mesangial expansion, hypercellularity and mesangial IgA, IgG, IgM, and C3 staining were seen. Therefore, due to the presence of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, full-house immune complex storage and mesangial hypercellularity in kidney biopsy, the patient was diagnosed to have secondary IgA nephropathy associated with liver disease. Our patient had already been treated with propranolol but the dose of propranolol was increased because of some improvement in IgA nephropathy can occur with control of portal hypertension. Although microscopic hematuria persisted in the follow-up period of approximately three years, no further macroscopic hematuria attack was observed.

2419,"Introduction: Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) may lead to renal parenchymal damage. Kidneys with large intrarenal pelvis have been reported to be more resistant to obstruction damage than those with small intrarenal pelvis. We evaluated the relationship between renal function and renal pelvis anteroposterior diameter (APD) in UPJO. Material and methods: Children with unilateral SFU grade 4 hydronephrosis were enrolled. Demographic data, antenatal/postnatal diagnosis, ultrasonographic and radionuclide imaging data were noted. Antenatal cases were grouped as <20 vs 20 mm, <30 vs 30 mm, while postnatal cases as <30 vs 30 mm based on APD. These groups were compared for parenchymal thickness and differential function. Correlation of APD with parenchymal thickness and differential function was also evaluated. Results: There were 28 patients [21 (75%) male; 17 (61%) antenatal diagnosis]. Median age at diagnosis was 83 (24-198) months in postnatal cases who presented with flank pain (8), urinary tract infection (2) or coincidentally (1). Pyeloplasty was performed in all patients except one antenatal case. Median age at pyeloplasty was 6 (3-31) and 81 (43-180) months in antenatal and postnatal cases, respectively. Parenchymal thickness and differential function of hydronephrotic kidneys were not different in both antenatal and postnatal case groups. APD was not correlated with parenchymal thickness and differential function in antenatal and postnatal cases. Only 6 patients (5 postnatal) had <30% differential function in the hydronephrotic kidneys. APD of the postnatal cases with <30% differential function was 37 mm, but mean APD of these patients was not different from the other postnatal cases. APD of the antenatal case with <30% differential function was relatively small (20 mm). Conclusions: Our findings did not confirm that the smaller the intrarenal pelvis the higher the renal damage in UPJO. The single antenatal case with higher renal damage despite relatively small APD suggests that this damage is due renal dysplasia in association with UPJO.",1.0,case,True

Material and methods: Case 1 A 11-year old girl receiving PD for two years admitted with abdominal pain and cloudy effluent with white blood cell(WBC) count of 880/mm3(69% neutrophils) . After obtaining dialysate culture, intraperitoneal cefazolin and ceftazidime were started. On fifth day,dialysate WBC decreased to 50/mm3.Sphingomonas melonis,a gram negative plant pathogen that was isolated from melons,grew on culture and was susceptible to sefotaxime.On further inquiring, she reported that she often played in the garden near their house. On 13th day,dialysate WBC increased and intravenous meropenem started based on antibiogram. On 16th day,she had fever and increased dialysate WBC count.Three other dialysate cultures were still positive for Sphingomonas melonis, and PD catheter was removed.

2438,"Introduction: Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is one of the most severe kidney diseases in childhood and adolescence. ARPKD is characterized by enlarged cystic kidneys and obligatory fibrotic changes in the liver. In most cases, ARPKD is caused by variants in the gene Pkhd1, encoding the transmembrane protein fibrocystin (FC). The function of FC is poorly understood. Our previous data suggest dysregulation of metabolic and inflammatory pathways (e.g. SRC-Stat3). Material and methods: Existing orthologous mouse models do not fully reflect the renal pathology of ARPKD patients. A novel digenic mouse model, which carries a hypomorphic variant of Pkd1 (R3277C) in addition to a Pkhd1 deficiency, was recently described.

Her past medical history was characterized by episodes of the passage of calculi and urologic interventions. The ultrasound examination of the kidneys demonstrated bilateral diffuse medullary nephrocalcinosis. Serum and urine biochemistry revealed hypomagnesemia (0.4 mmol/ l), increased iPTH (415 pg/ml) and hypercalciuria (5 mg/kg/day). Based on these clinical and laboratory parameters, the diagnosis of FHHNC was established. Evaluating for extrarenal symptoms, no hearing abnormalities were found, but she had nystagmus. Magnesium citrate supplementation and hydrochlorothiazide were given and well-tolerated. Renal function was mildly impaired in our patient and was relatively stable during the 1-year follow-up. Medical treatment aiming to control hypomagnesemia and hypercalciuria was partially efficient because of no regular use. The diagnosis of familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC) was confirmed by mutational analysis. Conclusions: FHHNC may present with the clinical features with mild hypomagnesemia leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and should be considered in the presence of nephrocalcinosis with hypercalciuria and hypomagnesemia.",1.0,disease,True

Material and methods: Review of medicals records of a girl with a first episode of NS that at diagnosis presented as severe venous thrombosis in left lower limb (LLL) with pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). Results: A 15-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital with a 3-days history of shortness of breath, asthenia, edema and painful in LLL. She has tachycardia with normal cardiovascular and respiratory physical examination. Rx thorax, ECG were normal. Doppler ultrasonography of lower limbs showed thrombosis involving common and left femoral veins. Computer-tomography-pulmonary-angiography demonstrated PTE affecting both the main pulmonary arteries and some segmental arteries. Laboratory investigation was incidentally detected to have NS, proteinuria (urine P/Cr 9), hypoproteinemia (4,7 mg/dl), hypoalbuminemia (2 mg/dl). Platelet count, creatinine, electrolytes, prothrombin, partial thromboplastin time, protein C and S, antithrombin were norma. Anticardiolipin antibodies and lupues anticoagulant were negative. But heterozygous mutation was identified in prothrombin gene G202210, which increases thrombotic risks. Anticoagulant treatment was started with low-molecular-weight heparin and steroid treatment for NS. Additional investigation by abdominal angio-magnetic-resonance identified compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery (May-Thurner syndrome) that also constitutes a thrombotic risk. The patient recovered successfully, developed a completed remission of NS. She receives thromboprophylaxis treatment. Conclusions: Thromboembolic disease is associated with high mortality, therefore early diagnosis and treatment are essential for patient survival. Screening for hereditary thrombophilia may be necessary for NS patients with thromboembolic events. May-Thurner syndrome should be investigated in patients with venous thrombotic events in left lower limb.",1.0,disease,True

Material and methods: This was a cross-sectional, descriptive, retrospective study carried out in the pediatric and internal medicine A departments of the Charles Nicolle hospital in Tunis. Transplanted patients of age less than or equal to 20 years were included during a 31-year period (from January 1989 to December 2019). A multivariate study was conducted to determine the independent predictive factors for the occurrence of UTIs after KT. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 115 kidney transplantations were included in our study during this period (69 boys and 46 girls). The average age was 15.5 years old. The transplantation was done from a living donor in in 67.8 % of cases. Infectious complications were frequent and dominated by UTIs in 37.4 % of cases. The mean time to onset of this UTI was 504.8 days. Its average number per patient was 3.4. The most implicated germ was Escherichia coli.The identified predictive factors of these UTIs were: Recipient's male gender, recipient's age, presence of vesicoureteral reflux prior to KT, presence of urological complications especially ureteral stenosis, the presence of urinary lithiasis, vesico-renal reflux, and the number of hospitalizations during the first year after KT (p<0.05).

We present two cases of ""pancake"" kidney detected accidentally. Material and methods: A case of a male neonate 15 days old and of a female infant 4.5 months old that were diagnosed and followed up in our department are described. Results: In both cases, the evaluation was conducted due to abnormal findings in antenatal and postnatal ultrasound (findings of possible horseshoe kidney in the first case and crossed fused renal ectopia in the second). The infants were asymptomatic, and the prenatal history was unremarkable. Technetium 99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy was conducted in both cases and ectopic kidneys that were fused in their upper, medial, and lower poles were pictured representing a ""pancake"" kidney. Each kidney had its excretory system and, in each case, both kidneys had normal uptake with no signs of parenchymal lesions. Both patients were asymptomatic, had no history of urinary tract infections, had a normal renal function, and had no other congenital anomalies. Conclusions: Children with ""pancake"" kidney usually remain asymptomatic and the diagnosis is often made accidentally, as in our cases. However, the clinician should be aware that the ""pancake"" kidney may be accompanied by other congenital anomalies of the urinary tract and an increased risk for malignancy.

RANK/RANKL pathway plays critical role in bone metabolism and immunity. Pathological kidney conditions are linked to changes in RANK/RANKL expression and localisation. The aim of this study was to describe changes in spatiotemporal expression of RANK and RANKL proteins within fetal developing, postnatal and nephrotic human kidneys. Material and methods: The expression of RANK and RANKL were examined on paraffin sections by immunofluorescence of 8 to 10- and 38week old developing, postnatal 1.5-year old and nephrotic syndrome patient human kidney tissue. Results: In 8-10th developmental week (dw), RANK was weakly expressed in all structures, but during further development, in 38th dw, expression was absent. In postnatal healthy kidneys, expression was visible only in glomeruli, at the visceral layer of the Bowman's capsule and in few glomeruli cells, while in nephrotic kidneys the expression at the same locations was much stronger. Regarding RANKL, the expression was more prominent in all presented specimens. Between 8th and 10th dw RANKL was expressed strongly in renal vesicle, C and S shape bodies, but was absent from collecting tubules. In 38th dw RANKL was expressed strongly in all cells of distal convoluted tubules (DCT), moderately in cells of proximal convoluted tubules (PCT) and weakly in glomeruli. In postnatal healthy kidneys, RANKL was expressed strongly in PCT and DCT, as well as in glomeruli, especially parietal layer of the Bowman's capsule. In nephrotic kidneys moderate expression of RANKL in glomeruli, PCT and DCT was visible, with the strongest expression in affected, enlarged tubules.

From complete blood count (CBC), initial NLR and PLR were calculated and leukocyte count of direct microscopic examination of peritoneal effluent, C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin (Hb), creatinin, MPV, albumin values on admission were detected. Age, gender, peritonitis rate and duration, time to each peritonitis episode, treatment failure (loss of peritoneal catheter or transfer to hemodialysis) were recorded. Median value of 3.8 and 134,75 were used for NLR and PLR, respectively. We divided the patients into two groups according to the median values of NLR and PLR as low and high NLR and PLR groups.They were compared to biochemical and clinical parameters. Results: Eleven patients were female (55%). Median age was 67 months (min-max:5-205 months).Time on peritoneal dialysis therapy was median 12 months (min-max:1-65 months). Median peritonitis duration was 5 days (min-max:2-27 months). Eighteen (40.9%) episodes were caused by Gram negative microorganisms.Sixty-three percent of peritonitis episodes were presented with more than 1000/mm3 leukocytes on direct microskopic examination whereas 6.8% were below 100/mm3. Nine (6.8%) episodes were resulted with treatment failure. Median CBC values were as following: white blood cell (WBC) of 11*103L, neutrophil of 8*103L, lymphocyte of 2*103L, platelet of 290*103L, NLR of 3.8, PLR of 134.75,Hb of 9.8 g/dL, creatinine of 4.43 mg/dL, CRP of 18.3 mg/L, albumin of 3.25 g/dL.

Frequent symptoms include hypertension (60-90%), headache (67%), followed by nausea, sweating, palpitations, and flushing. And neurologic complications such as hypertensive encephalopathy or herniation can be seen due to severe hypertension. Material and methods: We present a patient with pheochromocytoma who developed a reversible tonsiller herniation. Results: A 15-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital with neck pain and sudden onset of severe headache. Intermittent sweating attacks had been present. Her blood pressure was 180/110 mmHg (>99th percentile) and tendency to sleep was noted. Kidney function tests, serum electrolytes and glucose, blood gas analysis, thyroid function tests, renin-aldosterone levels and urinalysis were normal. Cranial computerized tomography (CT) demonstrated herniation in bilateral cerebellar tonsils. Intravenous sodium nitroprusside was started. Then, enalapril and amlodipine were added. Excretion of normetanephrine were significantly increased as 10952 g/ 24h (0-549 g/24h)]. In abdominal CT a mass lesion with 76x53x68 mm diameter, compressing the right kidney anteriorly was detected in the right adrenal gland. Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed pathologically increased gallium Ga-68 DOTATATE uptake in the 5.5x5 cm mass located in the right adrenal gland. Doxazosin was added to the treatment after previous antihypertensives. Esmolol infusion was implemented after alpha-blockade. After a shortterm infusion of esmolol, it switched to metoprolol. On the 27th day of hospitalization, the patient was operated upon providing optimal blood pressure regulation. The need for antihypertensive treatment decreased as early as four days after the operation, and metoprolol treatment was discontinued primarily. All antihypertensive doses were gradually reduced and discontinued within one month. Control cranial MRI was normal at the post-operative third month. Conclusions: Pheochromocytoma should be considered in the etiology in patients presenting with severe systemic hypertension. It should also be remembered that although very rare, hypertension may be associated with increased intracranial pressure by increasing cerebral or cerebellar perfusion, causing tonsillar herniation and accordingly inducing symptoms like neck pain and vomiting.",1.0,flu,True

It can increase the frequency of nephrolithiasis due to malabsorption as well as chronic dehydration. Also, chloride deficiency secondary to chronic severe diarrhea causes pseudo-Bartter syndrome. Material and methods: We present a patient with tufting enteropathy who followed-up as pseudo-Bartter syndrome and developed staghorn calculi in kidney. Results: 8-month-old girl presented to hospital for poor feeding, diarrhea and failure to thrive which started right after birth. At presentation, body weight was 4700 g (<3rd percentile). Laboratory results showed metabolic alkalosis (pH: 7.54, bicarbonate: 29.7mmol/L), hyponatremia, hypokalemia and hypochloremia. Hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism was present. Urine output was in the upper range. There was hyperoxaluria and hypocitraturia. Stool electrolyte measurements showed increasing in chloride. In the abdominal ultrasonography, echogenicities consistent with the stones filling the whole pelvicalyceal systems were noted in the middle and lower parts of the both kidneys. Considering the possibility of Bartter syndrome initially, indometacin was started. Pyridoxine and potassium citrate were added to the patients treatment. Severe diarrhea persisted in the follow-up. Indomethacin was discontinued at the end of three months of use considering the clinical picture of pseudo-Bartter syndrome. Genetic analysis demonstrated c.163T>C p.Cys55Arg homozygous mutation in epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) gene. The definite diagnosis of congenital tufting enteropathy was made. Staghorn calculi persisted in the follow-up, however, she did not have any urinary tract infections, urinary outflow obstruction or progression into chronic kidney disease. At the age of 3 years of age, she still had significant growth and developmental retardation and worsening in the fluidelectrolyte balance due to severe diarrhea. She was commenced on permanent total parenteral nutrition (TPN). However, she developed catheter-related sepsis on the 3rd month of TPN, and died on the 21st day of hospitalization in the intensive care unit. Conclusions: Clinical and biochemical picture of severe diarrhea may be very similar to Bartter syndrome.

Conclusions: Even though PRS is mostly caused by specific well defined immunological disorders, unknown and atypical causes can also lead to this life-threatening condition. Therefore, early clinical recognition and prompt immunosuppressive treatment are of greater importance than defining the cause which might remain inconclusive long after the full remission has been achieved.",1.0,positive,True

Congenital anomalies of kidneys and the urinary tract (CAKUT) form the main cause of CKD in children. Around 5% of adults with ESRD were born with CAKUT. Aim: To determine the structure of the CAKUT-syndrome in children at Vinnytsya Regional Childrens Clinical Hospital, Ukraine in 2018-2020 y. Material and methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using medical chart data from patients primarily treated in a single center in Ukraine during 2018 - 2020 years. Clinical, biochemical and radiological data were obtained. Results: CAKUT-syndrome was diagnosed in 610 children in Vinnytsya Regional Childrens Clinical Hospital during 2018 - 2020 years. The initial presentation of CAKUT-syndrome was in 112 patients (18.3%) and included signs of urinary tract infections and structural changes of kidneys. Most patients were boys. High number of CAKUT-syndrome was diagnosed prenatally. Less than 10% of all CAKUT were diagnosed in adolescence. Most of them presented with isolated changes in urinalysis (74%), rarely - with arterial hypertension. Among all CAKUT-syndrome in 2018, half of all cases belonged to congenital hydronephrosis, VUR, obstructed megaureter). In subsequent years 2019 and 2020, these defects predominated in the structure of the congenital anomalies, (45.3% and 42.3% respectively). CAKUTsyndrome including ectopia of the kidney, horseshoe kidney met with different frequency in 2018 (45 children), 2019 (37 children) and 2020 (32 children). The last place in the structure of the CAKUT-syndrome belonged to epispadia, diverticulum of the bladder, strictures - 5.3% in 2018, 3.3% in 2019, and 4.5% in 2020. Conclusions: Number of children with CAKUT-syndrome increased each year and may form a CKD in future.

2518,"Introduction: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the commonest urological abnormality in children and has been associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) and reflux nephropathy (RN). In children, RN is diagnosed mostly after UTI or during follow-up for antenatally diagnosed congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). Objective: To analyse the characteristics of a pediatric population with RN. Material and methods: This is a retrospective study of children with RN, diagnosed after an UTI (group 1) or during follow-up of CAKUT (group 2), followed in our hospital between 2004-2021. Renal scars were diagnosed by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan. Statistical analysis were performed using SPSS®. A P-value of less than 0.05 was accepted as significant. Results: Group 1 included 140 children (201 units) with VUR of which 51 had RN (36,4%). Group 2 included 39 children (58 units) with VUR of which 18 had RN (46,2%). In children with RN, there was a female predominance (67%) in group 1 and a male predominance (66,7%) in group 2. In group 1, the incidence of renal scarring was 29.9% in children with the first UTI before age 2, 14.9% between ages 2 and 4 and 13.8% in children over 5 years of age. There was a significative association between recurrent UTI and RN in both groups. Furthermore, the risk of renal scarring seemed to be increased at children with constipation. In both groups, there was a significant association between VUR severity and the presence of renal scarring (RN in group 1: IV-V: 100%, I-III: 23,4%; in group 2: IV-V: 84,6%, I-III: 40%). Conclusions: Higher grade for VUR and higher number of UTI proved to be determinant for renal scarring. The challenge is to identify the children with higher VUR and at risk of recurrent UTIs in order to prevent future kidney damage.",1.0,flu,True

She had presented scarlet fever two months earlier and upper respiratory tract infections. Results: Clinical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory tests showed nephrotic syndrome, brown macrohematuria, normal GFR and ultrasound. Initial suspicion of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis(PSGN) was sustained by the hypocomplementemia. However, atypical presentation emerged with non-hemolytic anemia,positive direct Coombs test,thrombocytopenia, hypergammaglobulinemia and high ESR:CRP ratio.

Bone-marrow aspiration and immunophenotyping excluded malignancies or EBVinduced cytopenia; immune-deficiency and SARS-Cov2 associated multisystemic-inflammatory-syndrome were ruled-out. Autoimmune screen revealed high ANA, anti-dsDNA, ENA and p-ANCA titer with anti-C1q, anti-platelet and anti-beta2GP1 antibodies associated with LAC positivity, but no anti-FB antibodies.Thus, cSLE was highly plausible, kidney biopsy was mandatory but postponed due to the hemorrhage risk. Thereafter, normalisation of CBC with three methylprednisolone boluses and oral prednisone,mycophenolate and hydroxychloroquine,enabled it.Histologically, class V lupus nephritis with NIH-score of 0/24 for activity and 0/12 for chronicity was observed. Considering the very earlyonset and suspected monogenic cSLE, genetic study is ongoing. Conclusions: PSGN is the leading cause of acute nephritis in children.Kidney biopsy is not required in typical cases with acute nephritic syndrome and C3 hypocomplementemia. However, red-flags such as hypocomplementemia persistence, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis or extra-renal manifestations, indicate a kidney biopsy to identify conditions associated with a negative renal outcome and requiring prompt appropriate treatment like C3-glomerulopathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis or cSLE.",1.0,disease,True

Kidney stone formation is affected by factors such as climate, dietary habits, drugs, occupation, fluid intake, genetic predisposition, urinary tract infections and malformations in the urinary tract. Material and methods: With this case report, the surprising reason for the formation of silicate stone which is extremely rare was explained. Results: A 7-year-old female patient who had a bone marrow transplant due to aplastic anemia two years ago was admitted to hospital with the complaint of stone in the urine. The patient with left flank pain noticed a 0.4x0.5mm gray-beige stone in her urine. Upon presentation, her physical examination was normal. Laboratory examination revealed normal kidney function test and blood gas analysis. For urine; tubular phosphate reabsorption was 95.8%, fractional excretion of sodium was 0.2%; urine protein/creatinine was 0.08 mg/mg, calcium/ creatinine was 0.01 mg/mg, oxalate/creatinin 0.01 mg/mg, citrate/ creatinin 0.35 mg/mg. Urine density was measured as 1007, and urine pH was measured in fresh urine by dipstick as 6. The urine output was 3.6 ml/kg/hour. Abdominal ultrasonography was normal. She was using only ursodeoxycholic acid as a drug for 18 months because of post-transplant hyperbilirubinemia. In the stone analysis performed by X-ray diffraction method, dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2) mineral accompanied by calcium was observed in addition to the quartz mineral (SiO2). The ursodeoxycholic acid tablet form that the patient was using was changed to the syrup form which is silicon dioxide free. Also hydration and a salt-restricted diet are recommended in the treatment and no new stone formation was observed in the follow-up. Conclusions: The fact that the disease is very rare causes curiosity on this subject. The importance of performing stone analysis as short as possible becomes clear once again.

We present kidney outcome of a large multi-national cohort of children with LN. Material and methods: 382 patients (18 years old) with LN class III diagnosed and treated in the last 10 years in 23 international centers were studied up to 24 months of follow-up. We defined complete remission as urine-protein-creatinine ratio 0.2 mg/mg and eGFR 90 ml/min/1.73m2 or serum creatinine increased less than 15%. Partial remission was defined as urine-protein-creatinine ratio <2 mg/mg or a 50% reduction if UPCR 2 at baseline and eGFR 90 ml/min/1.73m2 or serum creatinine increased less than 25%. Stable remission was considered as the persistence of complete remission from 6th months to 24th months of follow up and assessed in a subgroup of 351 patients. Results: 57% and 34% of patients achieved complete and partial remission at 24-month follow-up, respectively. Only 25.4% maintained stable remission. The reasons why patients didn't achieved stable remission were eGFR <90 ml/min/1.73m2 in 16.8%-30.5% of cases, increased serum creatinine in 6.8%-13.1% and urine-protein-creatinine ratio >0.2 mg/mg in 29.3%-45.6%. Patients with biopsy class III achieved complete remission more often than other biopsy classes. Complement 3, serum creatinine, urea and biopsy class at diagnosis were predictive parameters of stable renal remission. No difference in achieving stable remission was found between children who received mycophenolate or cyclophosphamide as induction treatment. Conclusions: In our cohort the rate of stable complete remission in patients with LN is still low. Severe kidney involvement at diagnosis was the most important risk factor for not achieving stable remission, while no difference were found between induction treatments. Randomized treatment trials in children with LN are needed to improve kidney outcome.",1.0,disease,True

2594,"Introduction: Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (NDI) is a rare disease and is characterized by production of hypoosmolar urine (> 50-60 ml/ kg) (age: 0-10 year) despite concurrent hypovolemia, due to the inability of renal collecting tubules (CT) to absorb water in response to antidiuretic hormone (ADH). In extreme rare occasions, the disease is caused by mutations in the AQP2 gene located on chromosome 12q13.12. Material and methods: A Syrian family including 5 family members was investigated. The proband was first admitted at the age of 4 9/12 years, presenting polydipsia, polyuria and signs of failure to thrive. Testing the proband upon admission revealed a low spot urine osmolality of 134 mOsm/kg (NL: 300-900 mOsm/kg) and a normal plasma osmolality of 285 mOsm/kg (NL: 275-295 mOsm/kg). The diagnosis of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus was retained and DNA analysis was performed. The patient is treated with a combination of indomethacin and amiloride together with an adequate supply of fluid and sodium restriction. Results: The genetic diagnosis is a novel AQP2 missense gene mutation (homozygous variant c490A>C(pIIe164leu)) in the proband.Testing of both parents and brother and sister gave the same variant (all were heterozygous) and all were since now symptom-free. The AQP2 monomer consists of five loops. According to our opinion the missense mutation of our proband is located in the fifth transmembrane segment. Conclusions: DNA sequence analysis revealed a novel missense mutation in the AQP2 gene. We suggest in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus that adequate diagnosis and treatment is important for improving the prognosis of these children.",1.0,disease,True

2598,"Introduction: Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is a rare hereditary syndrome characterized by resistance to mineralocorticoids.They manifest with sodium loss, hypovolemia,hyperkalemia,metabolic acidosis,and markedly elevated plasma aldosterone and renin levels.There are two phenotypes associated with the type of inheritance:autosomal recessive or dominant.The first affects the genes of the subunits of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC),being the defect systemic,serious and permanent; the second form,and the most frequent,is due to a heterozygous mutation of the NR3C2 gene that encodes the mineralocorticoid receptor with affection limited to the kidney and that is usually associated with a slight loss of salt, improving with age Material and methods: A 7-day-old male with hours of evolution of hypoactivity,two vomiting and dyspnea.Parents of Pakistani origin,positive consanguinity (first cousins),report death of their first daughter of unexplained cause at 8 days of life.On admission,he presented supraventricular tachycardia in context of severe hyperkalemia associated with hyponatremia Results: He received antihyperkalemic measures,hydration and intravenous corticosteroids due to suspected congenital adrenal hyperplasia.The subsequent hormonal study shows normal levels of 17-OH-progesterone, dihydroepiandrosterone-sulphate,and androstenedione,along with elevated cortisol.These results rule out the suspicion of adrenal hyperplasia, suggesting possible hypoaldosteronism, mineralocorticoid resistance,or renal tubular acidosis.After confirming elevated aldosterone and renin,it was oriented as Pseudohypoaldosteronism, complementing the diagnosis with an",1.0,positive,True

2604,"Introduction: Rituximab was approved in 1997 by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of some tipes of B-cells neoplasm as refractory leucemias or relapsing lymphoma. In subsequent years, its use has been progressively extended to other various non nephrological diseases, as multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica or immune thrombocytopenia and others more. Despite the proven efficacy and safety, currently in Europe, RTX appears to be authorized by EMA (European Medicines Agency) exclusively for non-Hodgkin Limphoma (NH), Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), rheumatoid arthritis, Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis and Pemphigus vulgaris. From the early 2000s, many reports have suggested that RTX is effective for children with frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (FRNS/SDNS).On the other hand, in the steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), in the absence of certain effective therapies, efficacy of RTX seem to be controversial to control the disease . In spite of the now common use of RTX in nephrotic syndrome, this therapeutic option still remains ""off-label"", with various regulations in each European country Material and methods: We report our experience about use ""off - label"" of RTX in a cohort of 33 children affected by NS (21 males, 12 females). After the usual steroid therapy, 25 were labeled as SDNS, 8 as SRNS. As second line therapy we used other drugs variously combined (Cyclosporine or tacrolimus in 30, cyclophosphamide in 11, Micofenolate in 9). Due to the persistence of NS, we prioposed to parents use ""off-label"" of RTX . It is a procedure governed by laws that, at least in Italy, requires the treating clinician to forward 1) authorization to the hospitals Health Department, supported by scientific literature 2) informed consent 3) communication of a therapeutic plan on the specific reasons involved in the use off-label (age, different therapeutic indication, route of administration or dosage) Results: Altogheter, in our patients we administered RTX (at dosage di 375 mg/mq) 68 times. Each individual patient received a variable number of administrations from 1 to 5. Only 3/8 pts with SRNS had total remission of proteinuria after infusions of RTX (1 - 5, mean 3 infusions). 4 of the remaining patients underwent one or more sessions of Plasma Exchange (PEX) but just one of them witnessed complete remission. 19/25 pts affected by SDNS or FRNS had a complete remission, after one o more administration, while one showed partial remission. 3 pts were lost to follow up, one was considered unresponsive.",1.0,disease,True

In the European Union (EU), there are two main routes for authorising medicines: a centralised route (EMA) and a national route (AIFA, in Italy). In light of the now common use of RTX in infantile NS, with efficacy and safety demonstrated by numerous trials and controlled clinical studies, it would be appropriate for the EMAor AIFA, urged by the scientific societies, to declare RTX ""AUTHORISED"" also in FRNS/SDNS. The purpose of this work is not to make known our experience on the use of Rituximab but rather to underline how this drug is now commonly used in NS. Continue to consider it as an ""off-label drug"" is now outdated in light of the multiple clinical experiences.",1.0,trial,True

2610,"Introduction: Congenital Anomalies of Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT) represent a heterogenous group of diseases with variable evolution, clinical manifestations and complications. CAKUT is the main cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children, while renal defects (hypo/dysplasia) are responsible for over 50% of adolescents needing renal replacement therapy. Diagnosing CAKUT is relatively facile due to non-invasive ultrasound examination screening, both prenatal and postnatal. Early diagnosis and monitoring may improve life quality and reduce the risk of complications, such as urinary tract infection (UTI) or CKD. Material and methods: We analysed retrospectively 42020 observation files for a period of 30 months and identified 252 children with CAKUT, while 73 patients had 82 renal malformations. Malformations of interest were: renal agenesia, renal hypoplasia, renal dysplasia, rotation/number or fusion anomalies. Data collection included: demographical data (age, sex, rural/urban origin), clinical data (symptoms, occasion of diagnosis, bilateral/unilateral defect, associated pathology) and biological data (renal function, microscopic urine exam, urine culture). Data was statistically analysed using SPSS v22 for Windows, MS Excel. Results: Out of 82 renal malformations, 48 were solitary renal malformations, 9 of them double, 21 associated with ureteral defects, one with vesical defect, while 3 patients had complex malformation. Renal displazia was the most frequent encountered defect, (0.057% incidence), followed by renal agenesia (0.049%) and renal hypoplasia (0.036%). Bilateral defects were present in 17 patients (20.73%), with a predilection for right side in unilateral malformations (1,4:1). Equal sex repartition and equal repartition in urban/rural areas. Most patients were aged over 6 years (54.79%) and toddlers (26.02%). Diagnosis was mainly random (38.35%) or simultaneously with an UTI episode (32.86%). Thirty-two patients (43.83%) with renal malformations developed UTI, while 21.91% of patients developed CKD.

2615,"Introduction: Orthostatic or postural proteinuria is a common condition in children, represented by proteinuria while in the upright position only, due to increased pressure on the renal glomeruli, which forces the passage of proteins through them. In the supine (clinostatic) position, pressure decreases and protein loss is absent Material and methods: An 11-year-old female patient was admitted to our department for occasional finding of proteinuria. No microhematuria was detected. She had normal serum creatinine levels, normal serum C3, C4 and immunoglobulin levels, negative family history for nephropathies. To discern orthostatic proteinuria, separate urine samples collected first-morning after at least 6 hours supine and at the end of an active day were collected. In the first urinalysis, UPCR was 0.71, in the second the ratio was negative (0.1). Assuming an error in the collection of the sample, the test was repeated 2 more times. However, the results were the same. Results: An ultrasound was performed showing normal kidneys and urinary tract. Collaterally, an expansive formation of 8 x 10 cm was found on the spleen, with clear and regular margins and ecostructure compatible with a splenic cystic. An MRI confirmed the diagnosis. Given the large size of the cyst, we hypothesized that the spleen could put pressure on the left kidney in the supine position, to explain the pathogenesis of the patients purely clinostatic proteinuria. Scleroembolization of the cyst has been attempted without a substantial reduction of the cyst, therefore proteinuria is still present in this patient. Conclusions: The finding of high-molecular weight non-nephrotic proteinuria in older children requires dosing in the orthostatic and clinostatic position to exclude a mechanical pathogenesis. In this particular case, the splenic cyst may cause a renal compression in the supine position only, reversing the frequent condition of orthostatic proteinuria and determining instead clinostatic proteinuria.",1.0,negative,True

2648,"Introduction: Bartter syndrome is a rare inherited salt-losing renal tubular disorder, whose primary pathogenic mechanism is defective salt reabsorption. BS is classified into five types, based on molecular genetics. There is significant variability in the clinical expression of the disease. Material and methods: We report the cases of two infants with antenatal BS and a secondary form of NDI. The first patient was a female infant born at 35 weeks of gestation with history of polyhydramnios and severe IUGR, with bilateral nephrocalcinosis. At two month of age she was referred for fever, failure to thrive, dehydration and vomiting. The second patient was an extremely premature female newborn of 26 weeks of gestation, after a pregnancy complicated by a marked polyhydramnios. Among other prematurity-related complications, she had neonatal diabetes mellitus, hypovolemic acute renal failure and severe failure to thrive; renal function slowly normalized; she started to show severe hypernatremia and polyuria. Both of our patients had hypernatremia and a urinary concentration defect, consistent with NDI. Laboratory test also revealed mild-moderate hypokalemia, normotensive hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism, inconstant metabolic alkalosis with normal serum chloride, hypercalciuria. Results: Intravenous 5% glucose solution was administered in order to correct hypernatremic dehydration. After therapy with indomethacin was started, their growth and serum electrolytes levels promptly improved. Potassium chloride is orally supplemented. Genetic analysis yielded mutations in the SLC12A1 gene, consistent with the diagnosis of BS type 1. Conclusions: A phenotypic variability has been reported in patients with BS; sometimes, type 1 and 2 BS may present with or develop a secondary NDI. In this case, despite BS is a salt-wasting disorder, salt restriction is crucial, in order to avoid polyuria and hypernatremic dehydration. Moreover, antenatal BS should always be considered in patients with polyuria and a history of polyhydramnios, prematurity and growth retardation.",1.0,clinical,True

We try to describe different phenotypes of patients with diagnosis of collagen IV disease. Material and methods: We reviewed medical records of these patients: symptoms, family history, age at diagnosis, genetic mutation, biopsy, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and proteinuria at diagnosis and follow-up. Results: We included 10 patients, with no family ties to each other, 7 girls and 3 boys with a mean age of 12.5 years. Clinically, 5 patients presented microhematuria, 1 microhematuria and proteinuria, 2 recurrent macroscopic hematuria and 2 nephrotic syndrome. The diagnosis was made in 4 patients by renal biopsy, two of them no pathogenic mutation was found. Genetical studies showed mutations in COL4A5 in two patients, COL4A3 in 4 and COL4A4 in 2 patients. All our patients have normal GFR. One patient with nephrotic syndrome maintains proteinuria/ creatinine ratio 0,7 and another responded to steroids without proteinuria at the present but with recurrent macroscopic hematuria. Patients with COL4A5 mutation have proteinuria even with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. No one else has proteinuria. One patient, with a COL4A3 mutation and C3 and C4 complement low levels, had a grandmother who died with chronic renal failure of unknown cause. The patient with heterozygous mutation in COL4A5 mutation has a mother who required transplant. Conclusions: Clinical manifestations of Alport syndrome may be atypical and mimic other diseases. Renal biopsy with electronic microscopy is a proven diagnostic tool. However, genetic panel sequencing of collagen IV alterations should be performed before an invasive procedure in patients with glomerular hematuria since the genetic result is often conclusive. Prognosis is good in short-term follow-up, but rather poor in long-term disease as suggested by the presence of proteinuria and family history.",1.0,clinical,True

It was aimed to evaluate the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and varicella immunoglobulin (Ig) levels in the cases followed up with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS). Material and methods: The patients aged 2-18 years who were followed up with INS between November 2018 and June 2021, who completed their national vaccinations and were in remission were included. Exclusion criteria were being under the age of two, having secondary NS/ proteinuria/ active infection/ known immunodeficiency, or failure to reach the vaccination schedule. Demographic and anthropometric data, follow-up period, number of attacks, USAge of immunosuppressive drugs, histopathological diagnoses, leukocyte and lymphocyte counts, serum urea, creatinine, albumin, c-reactive protein, Ig G-A-M, total cholesterol, and proteinuria levels were recorded. Positivity of IgG values was evaluated as >100 mIU/ML for varicella, >10 IU/ML for rubella, >250 mIU/ML for measles, >25 mIU/ML for mumps. Group comparisons were made according to treatment status and steroid response. Results: Thirty-nine patients (age between 3 and 18 years) were included. 51.4% were male, the median age was 13 years (3.7-18), the follow-up period was 50 months (12-120 months), and the mean number of attacks was 5.38 (1-17).

2698,"Introduction: To describe the clinical and evolutive features of surgical complications after kidney transplantation (KT) in Tunisian children Material and methods: This was a cross-sectional, descriptive, retrospective study carried out in the pediatric and internal medicine A departments of the Charles Nicolle hospital in Tunis. Transplanted patients of age less than or equal to 20 years were included during a 31-year period from January 1989 to December 2019. The kidney that was removed from the donor was placed in the extraperitoneal iliac fossa. We anastomosed the renal vein with the external iliac vein and the renal artery with the internal iliac artery or the external iliac artery. We performed extravesical anastomosis using the Lich-Gregoir technique for all kidney transplant recipients. Results: A total of 115 transplants were included in our study during this period; there were 69 boys and 46 girls. The mean age was 15.47 years. Surgical complications occurred in 28.6% of cases. These complications were dominated by vesico-ureteral reflux in 12 cases. We have recorded 5 cases of urinary fistula, 4 cases of lymphocele and 4 cases of renal allograft venous thrombosis. Two patients presented a right sural thrombophlebitis. We have recorded one case of ureteral stenosis after 12 months of renal transplantation leading to graft loss and a subsequent return to hemodialysis, and one case of transplant renal artery stenosis. Three children presented with retroperitoneal hematoma that resolved well with surgery. Only one case of urinary lithiasis was noted. One child presented with two different urological complications: a urinary fistula and vesicoureteral reflux. Conclusions: Kidney transplantation is a complex surgical procedure, especially in children, which can lead to surgical complications that can affect the prognosis of the graft and even the patient",1.0,clinical,True

Material and methods: Wild type and yotari mice were sacrificed at postnatal days P4, P11, and P14. Paraffin-embedded kidney tissues were sectioned and analyzed by bright-field and electron microscopy. Mean kidney and nephron substructures diameter was calculated and analyzed by statistical t-tests. Results: At the TEM microphotographs, foot process effacement in the glomeruli (G) of yotari mice was revealed, whereas aberrations in the structure of proximal convoluted tubules (PCT) and distal convoluted tubules (DCT) were not observed. Furthermore, yotari kidneys were smaller in size, with a reduced diameter of nephron segments, and thinner cortex. Conclusions: Renal hypoplasia in conjunction with foot process effacement revealed CAKUT phenotype and loss of functional kidney tissue of yotari.",0.0,,False

Material and methods: Case report Results: After 36 days of ALL treatment, the boy had gross macrohematuria, proteinuria (0.53 g/L) alongside mild renal insufficiency. The child was oliguric (less than 0.5 mL/kg/h) with elevated urea (13.8), and fast-rising creatinine (134) CT scan revealed mild hydronephrosis with left side nephrolit (4 mm) and a hyperdense content in the prevesical part of the of both ureters corresponding with clot, i.e., fresh hemorrhage. The bladder wall was trabeculated, circularly non-uniformly thickened, hyperechoic, up to 7.5 mm thick, in the sense of inflammatory changes. In the lumen of the bladder, for the most part along the wall, a hyperechoic content of up to 9 mm in size is seen; differential diagnosis may correspond to coagulation or hemorrhagic cystitis. PCR quantitative detection for BK Polyomavirus (226000 copies/ml) and Adenovirus (> 1000000 copies/ml) were positive. The child was treated with hyperhydration, a short course of hemodialysis, fresh frozen plasma, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), antithrombin III drug (Atenetiv), and periodic bladder lavage. Cyclophosphamide treatment was not administered prior to macrohematuria and postponed until the resolution of the nephrological condition. Renal insufficiency quickly resolved, but macrohematuria persisted for 33 days, significant proteinuria (> 0.12 g/L) lasted for one week. Conclusions: Acute renal failure and hemorrhagic cystitis were probably due to hematologic treatment and subsequent simultaneous BK and Adenovirus viral infections.",1.0,Case,True

2722,"Introduction: Thromboembolism is a well-known complication in nephrotic syndrome (NS) patients. The reported incidence of thromboembolism in nephrotic children is lower than in adults, ranging from 1.8 to 4.4%. This report discusses a thromboembolic complication in an infant with congenital NS. Material and methods: We present the case of a boy of two months old who had been recently diagnosed with congenital NS. During the initial in-hospital management of the severe proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia (including low-molecular-weight heparin), an transient episode of sudden paleness and coldness of the left forearm occurred. The day after this episode, the same signs reappeared with additional marbling of the skin. A pulsatile flow over the IV catheter in the left arm was noted, confirming its accidental intra-arterial position. A Doppler ultrasound showed a thickened arterial wall at the site of the catheter. Despite administration of a continuous heparin infusion, he developed compartment syndrome of the forearm for which multiple fasciotomies were performed. Necrosis of the skin of the forearm and the tip of the index finger occurred. Extensive wound care, silicone and pressure garment therapy were continued until 1 ½ year after the incident. The boy was treated with acetylsalicylic acid until the age of 22 months. Results: This case describes an arterial thromboembolic complication in an infant with NS. Thromboembolic complications are generally venous, whereas the occurrence of (peripheral) arterial thromboembolism in NS is rare. However, multiple cases have been described in the literature, each associated with significant morbidity and/or mortality.

2728,"Introduction: Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) count for 20 to 30 percent of all anomalies identified in the prenatal period. Different defects often occur in one child, and defects can be both unilateral and bilateral. We present a case of a neonate with CAKUT presenting with pseudohypoaldosteronism due to obstructive uropathy. Material and methods: Case description. Results: Prenatal evaluation diagnosed a boy with multicystic dysplasia of the left kidney and hydroureteronephrosis of the right kidney. He was born full-term and ultrasound on day 2 confirmed the prenatal image. Cystography showed active vesico-ureteral reflux (grade I) on the left side and a more dilated hydroureter (grade I-II) on the right side. Due to suspicion of an obstructive megaureter combined with a declining kidney function, a ureterocutaneostomy was placed on the right side at the age of 23 days. One day after hospital discharge, the patient presented on the emergency department because of anuria since a couple of hours. Ultrasound showed increase of hydronephrosis of the right kidney suggestive for obstructive uropathy and stable multicystic dysplasia of the left kidney. Lab results showed severe hyponatremia (124 mmol/L), hyperkalemia (7,1 mmol/L), decreased bicarbonate (17,5 mmol/L) with relatively high chloride (98 mmol/L) and acute kidney injury (peakcreatinine 2,52 mg/dL). There were no signs of infection. After acute management of hyperkalemia, the patient was urgently transferred to surgery for a percutaneous nephrostomy. The child recovered with normalization of electrolyte disturbances and kidney function. Conclusions: We discuss a male neonate presenting with a lifethreatening condition with acute kidney injury and pseudohypoaldosteronism due to obstructive uropathy. Although this phenomenon is well-documented in children with obstructive uropathy and urinary tract infections, the risk is unneglectable after urological surgery in patients with unilateral functioning kidney.",1.0,case,True

Material and methods: Between 2020-2021 three patient, 1 male (age 17) and 2 female (age 5 and 6), where admitted in our hospital, from Timisoara Romania. At admittance all patients presented with acute renal insufficiency, severe anemia with the presence of schizocytes on the peripheral blood smear, high LDH levels, thrombocytopenia and sever hypertension. One girl had also bloody diarrhea. All patients underwent clinical evaluation and full blood work, in order to form a positive diagnosis. Results: Renal replacement therapy was mandatory in all 3 cases with poor management of the malignant hypertension. Two patients were further investigated for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and chronic hemodialysis was necessary. The other patient was initially diagnosed with hemolytic syndrome and after 88 hours of CVVHDF was stopped and renal functions had resumed, but she had persistent bloody stools and needed several blood transfusions. Blood samples were sent to a specialized laboratory in order to analyze the complement pathway. The results concluded a complement dysregulation in the female patients secondary to sepsis and only one patient was confirmed with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. All patients started biological therapy with eculizumab which lead to the normalization of the blood pressure, resolution of the anemia and overall better quality of life. The male patient underwent a successful kidney transplant and no longer needs hemodialysis. One patient is currently waiting for a kidney transplant, the last one is in clinically stable.

2737,"Introduction: The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a cause of euvolemic hyponatremia due to nonphysiologic stimuli for arginine vasopressin production in the absence of renal or endocrine dysfunction. Psychogenic polydipsia is a disturbance in thirst control not caused by impairment in production or release of ADH. Material and methods: Two boys aged 12 years and 16 years (Case 1 and Case 2, respectively) admitted to Pediatric Emergency Department because of convulsion and impaired orientation and cooperation. Case 1 had been followed up for epilepsy and Tourette syndrome and receiving levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine. Case 2 had been receiving antibiotic treatment for dental abcess and he had drunk 5 lt of water in the last 4 hours before admission in order to alleviate his toothache. Results: On physical examination an ecchymotic area with a diameter of 5 cm on the left parietal region was observed in Case 1. Laboratory analysis showed hyponatremia, decreased plasma osmolality and inappropriately concentrated urine in both patients.

2743,"Introduction: Non-invasive medical nephrectomy by using NSAID, ACE inhibitors or calcineurin inhibitors decrease urine output and proteinuria resulting in rise of serum albumin in children with nephrotic syndrome before renal transplantation. Reported side effects of this approach include hypotension, elevated liver enzymes and reversible hypertension during treatment. We report a case with persistent refractory hypertension after medical nephrectomy. Material and methods: Case Report Results: Steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome was diagnosed in a 1.5year-old boy. Renal biopsy revealed FSGS. Genetic evaluation showed homozygote pathogenic NPHS2 mutation (c.353C>T, p.P118L). End stage kidney disease developed at 10 years of age. As he still had proteinuria (11 g/day) and hypoalbuminemia (1.5 g/dL) at this stage, medical nephrectomy was performed by cyclosporine A (2x75 mg), indomethacin (2x25 mg) and enalapril (1x10 mg) for 7 days before pre-emptive living related renal transplantation. After renal transplantation proteinuria resolved, but he developed severe hypertension (160/100 mmHg) that was refractory to medical therapy with combination of three antihypertensive drugs. Plasma renin (298 pg/mL; range 6-58) and aldosterone (1180 pg/mL; range 35-300) levels were greatly elevated. Graft functions including MR angiography and DMSA scan were normal. Bilateral native nephrectomy was performed after 2.5 years of follow up. Pathologically there was sclerotic glomeruli, thickened arteriolar wall, microcalcification, tubular atrophy and chronic mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates. Blood pressure, renin and aldosterone levels decreased immediately after the operation and the patient did not need antihypertensive drugs anymore. Conclusions: Medical nephrectomy for stopping proteinuria before transplantation has been used in patients with persistent nephrotic syndrome. Transient hypertension has been reported in a case given IV cyclosporine and IV angiotensin 2 infusion. Our case indicates that the drugs used for medical nephrectomy might cause injury in native nephrotic kidneys leading to high renin hypertension after transplantation.",1.0,case,True

In long-term hemodialysis patients, arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is recommended to be preferred to central venous catheters (CVC) in adult and recently in pediatric patients because of less side effects. The aim of this study is to analyze the thrombosis and affecting factors according to types of vascular access in pediatric hemodialysis patients. Material and methods: Information of children who received outpatient or inpatient hemodialysis treatment in our hospital between 2020-2021 was reviewed retrospectively. Results: Of the 80 patients, 46 (57.5%) were male, and the median age was 13±4.7 years. While 41 of the cases (51.3%) were acute renal failure, the others were chronic renal failure. Fifteen cases with a CVC for less than 5 days were excluded from the analysis. Thrombosis was detected in 8 of 54 patients with CVC and in 6 of 11 patients with AVF (p<0.05). Three of the AVF's had thrombosis within 3 months while the other 3 were seen in the later stages. Although 75% of cases with thrombosis of CVC were male the difference was not significant regarding the gender. 78% of thrombosis cases were patients who had an vasculer access for dialysis for more than 3 weeks. No significant association was found between age, location of CVC, acute-chronic renal failure, duration of the catheter USAge and the results of genetic analysis related to thrombosis. Conclusions: Thrombosis in CVCs was found mostly in men and the risk is increasing when the duration of the catheter USAge was more than 3 weeks.

2758,"Introduction: Schimmelpenning syndrome (OMIM 163200) is defined by association of nevus sebaceous with cerebral, ocular or skeletal defects. Ninety-five percent of cases with this syndrome has mutations in HRAS gene and 5% in KRAS gene. Vascular anomalies (coarctation of aorta, aortic aneurysm, renal artery, and carotid stenosis, chylothorax, and lymphedema) were reported with a frequency of 12.6 to 33%. Renal artery stenosis was reported in only one patient in the literature up to our knowledge. Material and methods: Herein we report a girl with Schimmelpenning syndrome and renovascular hypertension. Results: A 12 years-old girl admitted to outpatient clinic with fatigue, headache and, palpitation. Her symptoms had started six months ago and aggravated in last one week. Physical examination included, heart rate was 98/min, blood pressure was 138/69mmHg, a 15cm length hyperpigmented lesion on left cervical lesion, hairless region on scalp and, sclerocornea on left eye. She was followed up from an ophthalmologist with a diagnosis of Schimmelpenning syndrome. No blood pressure measurement was done previously. ABPM revealed mean blood pressure was 132/74mmHg (>95th percentile) and 74% systolic and 40% diastolic blood pressure load. Echocardiographic investigation and renal doppler ultrasonography were normal. MRI and CT angiography showed left renal artery stenosis with a 19x12mm aneurysmatic dilatation. On follow up amlodipine was given and then blood pressure was normalized. Conventional angiography was performed and showed left renal artery narrowing. Balloon dilatation failed to relieve obstruction and she is still having antihypertensive treatment. Genetic analysis of H-RAS was negative. Biorad CFX Connect Real Time PCR revealed K-RAS mutation on fourth exome. Conclusions: Schimmelpenning syndrome is a neurocutaneous syndrome and the knowledge on vascular anomalies is limited.

Material and methods: Case:A 16-year-old male patient presented with weakness,loss of appetite and weight loss in one month.Medical history revealed that he started fitness 2 months ago and lost 10 kilograms during last month.He did not have history of taking NSAIDs,protein powder but he used vitamin C and multivitamin pills.On physical examination,his height, weight and blood pressure percentiles and systematic examinations were normal.On laboratory tests creatinine was 1.93 mg/dl,BUN was 29 mg/dl,albumin 4.5 g/L,complete blood count,liver function tests and serum electrolytes were normal and peripheral blood smear showed no atypical cells.Urinalysis showed dansity of 1026 and protein of 1(+) on dipstick.Creatinine increased up to 3 mg/dl,urine output and blood pressure were normal.24 hour urine analysis revealed tubular proteinuria(protein 27 mg/m2/h, b-2 microglobulin 41.925 mg/day,microalbumin 66.14 mg/day). Since kidney functions did not improve,renal biopsy was performed.Pathology showed eosinophil-dominated inflammation in the tubulointerstitial area which was consistent with TIN.There was no pathological finding in his eye examination.Pulse steroid treatment followed by oral 2 mg/kg/day prednisolone treatment was started.After steroid he was hypertensive so amlodipine was added to his treatment.At sixth month follow-up,creatinine was 0.94 mg/dL and proteinuria was 3 mg/m2/h. Steroid treatment was tapered and discontinued.At tenth month follow up,eye examination was performed for hypertensive retinopathy but anterior uveitis was detected in the left eye. Conclusions: Patients presenting with TIN should be followed up for late uveitis,especially during the first 1-year period and less frequently afterwards,even if their kidney functions are normal.",1.0,case,True

PKD1-linked ADPKD has the manifestations of renal cysts, liver cysts, and intracranial aneurysm. Other clinical symptoms include: early-onset hypertension, abdominal fullness and pain, nephrolithiasis, hematuria and urinary tract infections (UTIs) They are usually observed decades before the onset of renal insufficiency. The most serious renal complication is end-stage renal disease. Material and methods: Case presentation Presented female patient was diagnosed with renal cysts at age of 11 by the ultrasound performed due to abdominal pain. Parents and other family members didnt have any history of policystic kidney disease. Renal cysts were confirmed by computed tomography and kidney scintigraphy. There was no evidence of liver cysts, nephrolithiasis, hematuria, urinary tract infections hypertension or renal insufficiency. The patient remained under the constant care of pediatric nephrologist. Results: At the age of 17 the girl had a genetic test which showed no pathogenic or potentially pathogenic variants. However a very rare variant with unknown pathogenicity was found in the PKD1 gene. Next Generation Sequencing revealed a c.3161+53C>G variant located in intron_13/45. The estimated frequency of this variant in Europe is 0,0060.

When compared to recent years, the prevalance of genetic studies in the form of larger panels ensure the diagnosis of patients and prevent unnecessary administration of immunsupressive treatments. Recent studies have shown that mutations in DGKE gene may cause either membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in children. Here we wanted to present a patient with clinical and laboratory findings of MPGN without HUS. Material and methods: Case presentation: The patient was the first child from consanguineous parents who admitted to our hospital at the age of five because of nephrotic syndrome. She did not respond to steroid therapy and renal biopsy confirmed MPGN. Cyclosporin A, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus treatments were administered. The genetic analysis for podocin, nephrin and WT1 were all normal. Cyclophosphamide and rituximab therapies were suggested but could not be given owing to a lack of consent from her parents.

2788,"Introduction: Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the most common etiology of intrarenal acute kidney injury(AKI). Acute tubular necrosis is usually self-limited, has no specific treatment, and largely improves with the elimination of the underlying cause. Limited data suggest that steroid therapy may be beneficial in selected cases accompanied by tubulointerstitial inflammation. In this report, a boy with ATN secondary to sepsis and responsive to steroid treatment is presented. Material and methods: Case A five-year-old male who had neurogenic bladder and normal kidney function, presented with fever, vomiting and bloody diarrhea. He was admitted to the intensive care unit due to septic shock. On the second day of admission, hemodialysis was started due to oliguric course, electrolyte imbalance and volume overload. In addition to AKI, signs of multiple organ failure(MOF) such as severe cholestasis and respiratory failure were also present. Despite improvement of clinical signs of septic shock and MOF, the need for hemodialysis continued after the eighteenth day. Kidney biopsy was performed to identify the etiology of prolonged and severe kidney damage. Light microscopy showed normal glomeruli, focal damage in the tubules and moderate inflammatory cell infiltration in the tubulointerstitial area. Because of acute severe renal impairment seen in our patient who had previously normal kidney function and ATN findings that accompanied by normal glomerular structure and modearate tubulointerstisial inflammation, 250 mg pulse methylprednisolone was given and treatment was continued with 2 mg/kg/day oral methylprednisolone. On the fifth day of treatment, a significant increase in urine output and an improvement in kidney function were observed. Hemodialysis was stopped at the end of the first month of treatment. Steroid treatment was tapered and discontinued within 2 months. He is still being followed up as stage-3 CKD. Conclusions: We wanted to emphasize that short-term corticosteroid therapy may be beneficial in refractory and severe ATN cases, if the glomerular structure is intact, if the signs of chronicity are not evident and if moderate to severe tubulointerstitial inflammation is present in histopathological examination.",1.0,case,True

A p-value<0.05 was significant. Results: A total of 35 patients were included in our study, the median age at diagnosis of the FSGS was 4.5 years. The univariate study found that failure to achieve remission on corticosteroids after the first episode of nephrotic syndrome (NS) was a predictor factor of progression to CRF. Family history of kidney disease, extra-renal signs, failure to achieve remission on corticosteroids after the first episode of NS, failure to achieve remission after 3 months of treatment with cyclosporine A (CsA) were associated with a risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Predictive factors for death were: creatinine clearance<60 mol/l, and end-stage renal disease. After a multivariate study, only a family history of kidney disease was found to be predictive of progression to ESRD. No predictive factors for death were found.

Children with atypical features should be referred for specialist pediatric nephrology assessment, including renal biopsy and genetic analysis. Material and methods: Case description. Results: A Caucasian boy of 1,5 years old with a blank medical history was referred because of nephrotic range proteinuria in combination with haematuria. Clinical examination showed mild periorbital edema, present for one month, and significant hypertension (> P99). Urinalysis showed proteinuria (13,6 g/g creat) and haematuria (5261/L). Lab results showed a normal kidney function and hypoalbuminemia (21 g/L). Clinical examination showed mild periorbital edema and significant hypertension. Kidney ultrasound showed no vascular abnormalities, but bilateral enlarged kidneys with increased echogenicity and swollen aspect of the cortex. Ophthalmic screening showed no abnormalities. Cardiac screening was negative. Infectious diseases were excluded. A kidney biopsy was performed and showed an image of mesangial hypercellularity and diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS) with negative immunofluorescence, suggestive for an underlying hereditary cause. Genetic analysis is pending. Treatment with oral corticosteroids was initiated, and until now, proteinuria is declining progressively in this patient. Conclusions: We present a young boy with infantile nephrotic syndrome based on DMS. It is a rare disease with a poor prognosis and rapid progression to end-stage kidney failure. The etiology and pathogenesis of DMS is not well understood, but it is associated with dominant pathogenic variants in WT1 (23,1%) and biallelic pathogenic variants in PLCE1 (17,8%), LAMB2 (13,6%) and NPHS1 (4,9%).

2860,"Introduction: Constipation is a common childhood problem, accounting for about 3-5% of all visits to the pediatrician. Most of them are functional constipation; toilet phobia is one of the rare causes. Constipation is also a condition associated with bladder dysfunction and urinary tract infections. The relationship between this abnormal bowel and bladder function is called the dysfunctional elimination syndrome (DES). Material and methods: We present a girl who has been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease due to severe constipation, in which toilet phobia is the triggering factor. Results: A 4-year-old girl applied to the pediatrician because of constipation. She delayed her urination and defecation due to the fear of falling into the toilet. The patient with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection had a significant increase in serum creatinine. In physical examination; growth retardation, pallor, abdominal distention, and fecal contamination in her underwear were observed. Laboratory analysis revealed blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 65 mg/dl, creatinine: 2.01 mg/dL, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, anemia and metabolic acidosis. There was no pyuria and hematuria in the urine analysis, there was no growth in the urine culture, but the protein/creatinine ratio was high. Colonic distention and intense gas/stool appearance on abdominal X-ray; diffuse residual fecaloids and elongated bladder on computed tomography; reflux in the both kidneys on voiding cystoureterography; and decreased cortical functions in dimercapto succinic acid scintigraphy were detected. Excessive trabeculation in the bladder was observed in cystourethroscopy. In the same session, fecaloids in the distal rectum were evacuated by digital rectal manipulation. There was rapid improvement in kidney function; creatinine dropped to 0.8 mg/dL after four days. In the video-urodynamic study, it was observed that detrusor pressures increased and urethral sphincter activity increased simultaneously during the voiding phase. Dyssynergic contraction of the pelvic floor muscles by the urethral and anal sphincters was demonstrated. Doxazosin was started for DES. The patient, who overcame her toilet phobia and recovered from constipation, is being followed up with renal replacement therapy with the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. Conclusions: Constipation, which is common in childhood, may be associated with serious consequences such as urinary complaints and even progression to chronic kidney disease.",1.0,disease,True

She was prescribed with prednisolone 2 mg/kg and remission obtained at 2nd weeks. Later prednisolone dose was reduced to 0,5-0,7 mg/kg but relapse occurred, and patient received corticosteroids continuously. A girl was diagnosed with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, steroid dependent course, frequent relapsing. At age of 3 she was treated with cyclophosphamide for 4 months without effect. From 4 years old she was treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for 2 years, relapse of nephrotic syndrome was less frequent and faster response to prednisolone was achieved. At age of 7 she underwent a kidney biopsy - minimal histological changes in kidney cortex. Results of immunofluorescence: IgA, IgG - negative in glomeruli, IgM - slightly positive, segmental in the glomerular capillary walls. Complement C3, albumin - negative in glomeruli. At the ages of 11 she has slowed physical development, developed with Cushings syndrome and secondary cataract. At 12 years girl received Rituximab i/v infusion two times.

Patients affected by these diseases are often treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce urinary losses. Long-term use of NSAID in the general population is associated with a risk of chronic kidney disease, but it is unclear, whether this also applies to patients with NDI or Bartter syndrome. We therefore set out to investigate the association between NSAID and eGFR in these patients. Material and methods: This is a retrospective, cross-sectional cohort study conducted through the European Rare Kidney Disease Reference Network (ERKnet), the European Society of Paediatric Nephrology (ESPN) and the European Renal Association (ERA-EDTA). Clinicians were invited by email through these organisations to submit clinical information on NSAID exposure, as well as first and last known eGFR if patients with genetically confirmed Bartter syndrome or NDI via an online portal. Results: This is an interim report, as data collection is still ongoing. As of 10th January, data on 185 patients were submitted. The patients were 60% male and 40% female. White ethnicity was predominant equal to 76%, followed by Asian 11%, Black 4% and Other 6%. Underlying genes were (KCNJ1 15%, SLC12A1 16%, CLCNKB 35%, AVPR2 22%, AQP2 7%). 83% children received NSAID treatment, whilst 17% did not. The median age was 9.9 (IR 8-17.9). Conclusions: The large number of patients for whom data have been provided is encouraging and suggests that we will have statistical power to detect any substantial differences in eGFR associated with NSAID use.""",1.0,Clinical,True
