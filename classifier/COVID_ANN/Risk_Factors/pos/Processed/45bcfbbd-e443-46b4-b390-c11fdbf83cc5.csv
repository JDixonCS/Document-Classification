30,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a worldwide pandemic disease (declared in March 2020 by the WHO) that was primarily registered in Wuhan, China.

31,"Spontaneous pneumothorax (PTX), pneumomediastinum (PM), and emphysema (EM) are uncommon yet important complications in severe COVID-19 patients.

In mechanically ventilated patients, an increase in the airway and alveolar pressure and alveolar rupture may result in PM, PTX, or subcutaneous EM. Still, in COVID-19 infection, the nature of the disease and its immunological and inflammatory process may have a prominent role in these phenomena (2, 4, 5). A high mortality rate was reported because of severe concomitant parenchymal damage and PTX, PM, or EM in COVID-19 pneumonia (6, 7).

We also found that men experience air leak syndrome more commonly than women, which was also reported by Chong et al. (10). According to Bwire et al. sex-based immunological differences, higher expression of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) in males than females, cautious preventive behavior in females, and gender lifestyle are responsible for male dominancy in COVID-19 infection; which is consistent with this study (11). However, there is controversy surrounding this matter, as some studies have found no correlation between gender and occurrence of air leak syndrome in COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the issue of gender and air leak syndrome in COVID-19 patients requires further studies and investigations (12, 13).",1.0,COVID-19,True
149,"The mechanism and pathophysiology of air leak syndrome has not yet been completely explained, however barotrauma caused by mechanical ventilation has been accused of being an important factor in development of air leak (14). Long-term mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients causes cyst ruptures and air escape that could lead to PTX, PM or EM (15, 16). In our study, various ventilatory parameters brought on higher risk of air leak syndrome in patients. Patients who developed PTX after intubation, had higher peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and the fraction of expired oxygen (FiO2) which is in line with other studies (9).",1.0,COVID-19,True
150,"Despite barotrauma from mechanical ventilation being the number one cause of air escape and air leak syndrome, not every case of air leak syndrome in our study could be related to that, as is it with other studies and case reports (17). The exact mechanism of spontaneous air leak (air leak without a predisposing factor (i.e., mechanical ventilation) in COVID-19 is still unclear and many theories have been proposed by different studies (18, 19, 22). One of the most plausible theories is that the lung damage caused by COVID-19 by dysregulation of immune system response, inflammation, and cytokine release damages the alveolar walls thus causing air space rupture during deep breathing or coughing, which can result in air leak syndrome (19-21).",1.0,case,True
151,"Patients with air leak syndrome had a significantly higher mortality. In our study 69% of the patients in the case group dies, which is much higher than the 15% in the control group. Moreover, the odds ratio of death in case group was 10.6 times higher than the control group. This finding highlights the importance of this not-so-common complication. According to Chopra et al. in hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients with pneumothorax was 63% and the odds of in-hospital death was 2 times higher in this group compared to COVID-19 patients without pneumothorax (23). Lower odds of death compared to the control group in their study than ours could be due of the fact that they only studied patients under mechanical ventilation, among whom there is a higher chance of in-hospital death.",1.0,case,True
