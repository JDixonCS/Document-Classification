6,"Background: During pandemic process, nurses reported to experience stress due to a very high risk of being infected and workload. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed nurses to conditions that threaten their health, well-being, and ability to work. It is therefore critical to study nurses' experiences and well-being during the current crisis in order to identify risk groups for ill health and potential sources of organizational intervention.",1.0,pandemic,True
7,"Method: A qualitative descriptive cross-sectional study with a sample consisting of 180 nurses working in Fujairah Primary health care centers. To collect data, an online survey questionnaire was formulated which was used together with the Perceived Stress Scale among a sample of 280 nurses who were working in Fujairah Primary health care 2021.

Findings revealed the distribution of respondents by stress level either low and moderate. 89.4% of respondents had moderate stress level as compared to 10.6% with less stress. There is no presence of normal and high stress. There was no significant association between the stress when compared to socio-economic factors like age, gender, marital status, qualification, and job title (P > 0.05).

10,"Implications for Nursing Management: Healthcare institutions should provide opportunities for nurses to discuss the stress they are experiencing, support one another, and make suggestions for workplace adaptations during this pandemic. Meeting physiological needs, applying psychological guidance and counselling interventions in the stress management of nurses may contribute to the reduction of their stress levels. Effective infection control, reducing workload, increasing the number of nurses and strengthening the coping mechanisms can minimize the perceived stress level of nurses.",1.0,pandemic,True

13,"The COVID-19 pandemic has started to threaten the health care systems of countries and has increased the burden on health care professionals (Chen & Huang, 2020;Açiksari & Kinik, 2020). Health care professionals are the most valuable resource in protecting, preventing and treating public health for all countries (WHO, 2020b; Açiksari & Kinik, 2020; Chen & Huang, 2020). The services of primary health care, which are one of the units where these basic services are provided, are the place that have important roles in the pandemic process as in other disasters and make the first intervention to patients affected by the infectious agent (Açiksari & Kinik, 2020).",1.0,COVID-19,True
14,"As on April 23rd, 2020, more than 2.6 million cases of COVID-19 have been detected globally and the numbers were rising with each passing day. Understandably, parallel and equally urgent need to strengthen primary healthcare was required. There are several reasons for this. Primary Health Centers (PHCs) are likely to be the first point of contact for most COVID-19 patients. Experience from China and Italy suggests that of all patients with the disease, 5- 10 percent become severely ill and require admission to a health facility. About 70 percent of these patients can be managed with supportive care and oxygen, which PHCs can easily provide. Additionally, on account of their proximity to the communities that they serve, primary health facilities are best suited to educate and inform them about COVID-19. And finally, at a time when there is such restricted access to healthcare due to the lockdown, PHCs ensure access to healthcare for pregnant women, elderly, children and high-risk people with conditions such as diabetes, hypertension etc.",1.0,case,True
15,"Disease outbreaks such as COVID 19 pandemic are stress-provoking situations. Stress is common among healthcare workers especially nurses who are directly involved in managing affected patients during pandemic. The main source of stress in nurses during COVID-19 pandemic are fear of becoming infected or unknowingly infecting others. (m o et.al:2020). Shanfelt, Ripp and Trockel (2020) identified other sources of stress in nurses, including lack of personal protective equipment, fear of access to COVID-19 testing, fear of transmitting the virus at work, doubt that their institution would support them if they become infected and fear of being deployed in an unfamiliar ward or unit and lack of accurate information on the disease.",1.0,Disease,True
16,"Stress is a universal human experience and is an integral part of the biological structure of any living organism. Stress has both positive and negative effects on people. While a low level of stress is motivating for the person, above-average stress can cause people to be unable to work or cause serious physiological problems (Görü, 2016).",1.0,positive,True
17,"The psychological and physical health of nurse was influenced by many factors. Previous studies reported that personal factors such as gender, age, educational level, marital status, having children or not, and personality might be correlated with the mental health among nurses (Cañadas-De la Fuente et al., 2018; Sadati, Hemmati, Rahnavard, Lankarani, & Heydari, 2016)",1.0,flu,True
18,"Previous studies (Li et al., 2015; Maunder et al., 2003; Ulrich, 2014) carried out during the outbreak of SARS described increased mental burden on nursing staff. These frontline nurses were reported to have a high risk of psychological distress, such as increased stress level, sleep disturbance, loss of selfconfidence and inability to make decisions, as well as physical health problem (Nickell et al., 2004; Thamet al., 2004).",1.0,outbreak,True

Data collection technique & Validity The questionnaire in English and Arabic was prepared by the authors and submitted to ethical department for validation and thereby distributed. It had two parts Part I: Covering their sociodemographic variables and variables on their working environment, including attitude of the different category of working staff, job title, and so on. Part II: To assess the stress level with 10 questions as part of our research study to assess the stressful situations dealt with during the COVID-19 pandemic based on a classic stress assessment tool, The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). A total score 60, was classified into 0-13: Stress is not a problem in life; 16-30: Moderate stress, which can reasonably be reduced 27-40: Stress is a major problem and something must be done. 2.13. Ethical Considerations Each nurse who participated to the survey questions were by his/her consent and not driven by any external or internal sources. The survey was confidential and anonymous, and the participants could terminate their participation at any time. The study questionnaires were approved by EHS, Data and Statistical Department. 2.14. Data Analysis The data obtained were analysed in terms of the objectives of the study using Descriptive and Inferential statistics. A master data sheet was prepared with responses given by the participants with Frequencies and percentage for the analysis of demographic data, the mean and standard deviation of answered questions. The Chi Square test was used to determine association between stress level and selected demographic variables presented in tables and graphs. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research, were followed in the planning and execution of this study to ensure methodological integrity. Qualitative content analysis of the responses were conducted using a data-driven approach. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), a classic stress assessment instrument was used to framework for structuring qualitative data for analysing the stress level that are relevant to the research question.

301,"While this qualitative analysis sheds light on sources of nurses' experiences of stress early in the pandemic, the study has some limitations. First, participants were limited to nurse members of only one nursing organizations that is primary health care centers in a single emirates (Fujairah), and results may not be generalizable to nurses in other PHC's, hospitals or emirates. Significantly, there are good number of nurses (N,""180) who completely respond to the survey questions working in Fujairah primary health care, compared to nurses who did not respond to the question. It is possible that non-respondents may have experienced different work-related factors that may have influenced their perceptions of stress. Nevertheless, the majority of respondents (over 95%) answered, which limits non-response bias. Our study sample was also substantially larger than those of two previous qualitative studies that explored the perceptions of 20 nurses [21] and 13 nurses and physicians [22] in China. As in all qualitative studies, researcher bias may influence findings. However, analysis in the current study were validated through another researcher who was not involved in the original coding.""",1.0,pandemic,True

303,"The results of this study clearly demonstrate that the prevalence of stress, within front-line healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients are moderate. Therefore, the healthcare authorities, and decision-makers, nationally and internationally, should take measures to reduce this stress in staff treating the COVID-19 patients. This increases the productivity of the staff, speeds up the measures to control the pandemic, and provides more effective treatment procedures for the COVID-19 patients. Exploration of nurses' perceptions of stress during the pandemic's early phase provides important insight into the nature of nurses' experiences and potential measures that healthcare institutions can take to mitigate nurses' stress. Providing nurses with adequate personal protective equipment is one concrete measure that can help to keep nurses safe and to alleviate their fear of becoming infected. Healthcare units should provide opportunities for nurses to discuss the stress they are experiencing, support one another, and make suggestions for workplace adaptations during this pandemic. Healthcare institutions and nurse managers need to recognize these sources of stress in order to identify potential organizational interventions to maintain nurses' health, safety, and well-being.",1.0,COVID-19,True
