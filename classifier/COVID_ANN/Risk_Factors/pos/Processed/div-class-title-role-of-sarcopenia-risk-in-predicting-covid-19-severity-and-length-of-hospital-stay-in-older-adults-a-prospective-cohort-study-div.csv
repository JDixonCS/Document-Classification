8,"Sarcopenia is more common in the elderly and causes adverse outcomes with increased morbidity and mortality. This prospective cohort study assessed the association of sarcopenia risk with the severity of COVID-19 at the time of admission and during hospitalisation and the length of hospital stay. Two hundred patients (aged  60 y) who were hospitalised for COVID19 were enrolled using consecutive sampling between December 29th 2020 and May 20th 2021. The sarcopenia score of the patients was assessed using the Strength, Assistance in walking, Rising from a chair, Climbing stairs, and Falls (SARC-F) questionnaire. The severity of COVID19 was determined using the modified National Early Warning Score (m-NEWS) system for 2019 n-CoV infected patients at admission (T1), day three (T2), and at discharge (T3). Data were analysed using SPSS, version 22 and STATA, version 14. Of the 165 patients included, 34 (20.6 %) were at risk of sarcopenia. The length of hospital stay was slightly longer in patients with sarcopenia risk, but the difference was not significant (P , 0.600). The adjusted odds ratio of respiratory rate (RR) > 20 /min at T1 for the sarcopenia risk group was 6.7-times higher than that for the non-sarcopenic group (P ,"" 0.002). According to Generalized Estimating Equations, after adjusting for confounding factors, the m-NEWS score was 5.6 units higher in patients at risk of sarcopenia (P < 0.001). Sarcopenia risk could exacerbate COVID-19 severity and increase RR at admission, as well as the need for oxygen therapy at discharge.""",1.0,COVID-19,True

13,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a public health emergency since March 2020(1). This severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 480 million individuals and caused more than 6 million deaths worldwide(2). The common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, headache, diarrhoea, anorexia, and loss of taste and smell, as well as respiratory symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. Moreover, interstitial pneumonia may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome with subsequent sepsis-induced coagulopathy and multiple organ dysfunction(3, 4). Adherence to safety measures and strengthening the immune system are important approaches for protecting individuals against COVID-19 until approved pharmacological therapies and vaccines become globally available(3, 5).",1.0,Coronavirus,True
14,"The overall prevalence and number of severe cases of COVID-19 are higher among older individuals(6). Factors such as sarcopenia, chronic diseases, and nutritional inadequacy, which are more prevalent in older adults, can adversely affect the immune system and physiological function(6-8).",1.0,case,True
15,"Particularly, sarcopenia is a progressive, generalized skeletal muscle disorder defined by the loss of muscle mass, physical performance, and strength(9, 10). Risk factors for this disorder include aging, nutritional deficiency, chronic diseases, physical inactivity, anxiety, and very low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels(11). The prevalence of sarcopenia in the elderly ranges from 9.9 to 40.4 %, according to a systematic review(12). This prevalence's range depend on factors such as the reference used for its definition, age, gender and ethnicity(11, 13). Specifically, different definitions of sarcopenia do not necessarily measure the same underlying variables; thus, even within the same population, sarcopenia estimation can vary depending on the definition(14). In addition, sarcopenia is more prevalent among non-Asian individuals(15), men older than 80 years, and women younger than 70 years(16).",1.0,disease,True
16,"Nutritional status, sarcopenia, and the immune system are strongly related to each other. Nutritional deficiency exacerbates sarcopenia and as a result will weaken the immune system(17). In COVID-19 patients, sarcopenia can cause deterioration of respiratory system function by weakening the muscles involved in respiration. Moreover, it can increase the risk of aspiration because of its negative impact on the muscles involved in swallowing(11, 18). On the other hand, a",1.0,COVID-19,True

19,"combination of obesity and sarcopenia can result in a state called sarcopenic obesity, in which there is a reduction in muscle mass in addition to an elevation in fat mass(19). Studies have shown that the prevalence of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress is higher in sarcopenic obesity than in sarcopenia alone and can result in the deterioration of immune system function(20).",0.0,,False
20,"Information about the sarcopenia effect on the severity of COVID-19 is rare and controversial. In a previous study on hospitalised COVID-19 patients, with a median age of 62 years, sarcopenia was associated with a longer hospital stay. The authors assessed the severity of the disease using the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) system at baseline and found a significant difference between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic groups(21). The NEWS2 is a system for scoring the physiological measurements that enable the early detection of clinical deterioration(22). However, another study reported no significant difference between patients with low and normal skeletal muscle index in terms of mortality, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and the NEWS2 at baseline (median age, 51 years)(23).",1.0,COVID-19,True
21,"It is clear that prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of sarcopenia are important for the management of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory diseases(18).

The transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-B (NF-B) also increases with aging in a variety of tissues. NF-B activates inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-, in the body(44).

However, in sarcopenic patients, these reserves are low(11); thus, severe COVID-19 is more probable(11).

81,"The strengths of the present study are as follows. First, recruitment was performed in a referral COVID-19 hospital; thus, participants from distinct financial, cultural and societal levels willingly participated in our study. Second, sarcopenia was screened using a web-based platform that ruled out the need for an appointment after discharge that could have been difficult for elderly patients to attend. In addition, the SARC-F questionnaire was completed by an expert nutritionist.",1.0,COVID-19,True
82,"We also had some limitations, the SARC-F questionnaire was completed based on patient recall and we did not confirm the data by measuring skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength(53). However, the SARC-F questionnaire has previously been validated as an effective tool for assessing sarcopenia risk(25, 54). Also, we recorded the data required to calculate the mNEWS at T1, T2, and T3, but we only recorded laboratory results and other COVID-19 symptoms (like cough, digestive disorders, anorexia, and headache) at T1.

We checked the effect of this discrepancy in anthropometric measurements by repeating the statistical analysis after excluding the mentioned 15 participants and the results did not change (data are not shown here).",0.0,,False
86,"COVID-19 is more easily detected and tends to be more severe in older adults. This is related to a combination of age-related immune system weaknesses and comorbid disorders(55). Therefore, it is recommended that older adults learn ways to prevent sarcopenia through virtual education during the pandemic(20). Adequate intake of energy, protein, calcium, vitamin D, and other micronutrients, along with increased physical activity, improved sleep quality, and stress management would be helpful for preventing sarcopenia(17). The recommended protein intake is at least 1.0 to 1.2 g/kg/d in healthy older adults, 1.2 to 1.5 g/kg/d in malnourished or sarcopenic older adults afflicted with acute or chronic illness, and 2.0 g/kg/d for patients afflicted with severe illness such as COVID-19(18, 56). High-quality proteins should be equally distributed across the three main meals(57). It is also recommended that all sarcopenic patients measure their 25-hydroxyvitamin D level(58).",1.0,COVID-19,True
87,"This study has paved the way for further research to consider the relation between sarcopenia and COVID-19. It is also recommended to measure skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength in addition to completion of the SARC-F questionnaire, as well as to monitor the longterm effects of sarcopenia on COVID-19 complications.",1.0,COVID-19,True
88,Conclusion,0.0,,False
89,The results of this study showed that the presence of sarcopenia exacerbated COVID-19 severity. These results suggest that patients at risk of sarcopenia had higher RR at the time of admission. Our findings are promising but should be confirmed by more long-term cohort studies to establish a possible positive relationship between sarcopenia and severe COVID-19.,1.0,COVID-19,True
