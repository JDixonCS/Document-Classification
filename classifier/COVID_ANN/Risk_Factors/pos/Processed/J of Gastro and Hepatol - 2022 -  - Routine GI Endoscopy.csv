5,"Background and Aim: Patients with emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) who present with repeated intentional foreign body ingestion (RIFBI) have poor health outcomes and high health care resource utilization. Longer hospital stays can further reinforce maladaptive behavior, perpetuating the cycle of self-harm behavior and subsequently increasing the risk of both actual and iatrogenic harm to the patient. We developed a novel interdisciplinary acute management plan (AMP) individualized to each patient. In this study, we aimed to assess health service outcomes for patients before and after implementation of the AMP. Methods: Since 2016, patients with EUPD presenting to the emergency department (ED) at our tertiary-care institution with RIFBI have been offered formulation of an AMP. After patient consent, a multidisciplinary meeting between community and hospital-based specialists is held to develop an individualized AMP. The AMP informs clinical management and disposition for presentations relating to intentional foreign body ingestion. It allows for discharge to community care from endoscopy without further inpatient assessment. The aim of the AMP is to prioritize treatment of underlying psychopathology, while ensuring patient safety and reducing admissions and endoscopic procedures. All consecutive patients with EUPD and RIFBI who received AMP were identified. Electronic medical record data for ED presentations to all public hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and inpatient admissions to our institution were collected. The data before and after implementation of the AMP were summarized and presented as medians with interquartile ranges. Results: Nine patients had 457 ED presentations with RIFBI between 2011 and 2021, inclusive. Of these, 273 presentations were at our institution, resulting in 201 admissions and 171 endoscopy procedures. There were a median of 9.8 ED presentations per person-year (IQR, 4.6-14.0) before implementation of AMPs, compared with 7.0 (IQR, 4.0-11.8) after implementation (P ,"" 0.21).

8,"Background and Aim: Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted colonoscopy has gained attention as a tool to assist with polyp detection during colonoscopy. Uncertainty as to the clinical benefit remains, given limited publications using different AI modules. Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective study at Waitemata Endoscopy, an independent endoscopy center in Auckland, New Zealand. An Olympus ENDO-AID module was used for the first time by 13 experienced endoscopists (Fig. 1). Outcomes from the use of AI-assisted colonoscopy over a 6-week period were compared with a subsequent conventional colonoscopy (CC) control group. Results: A total of 213 AI-assisted colonoscopies were compared with 213 CCs.

The withdrawal time was significantly longer in the AI-assisted colonoscopy group compared with CC controls (15 vs 13 min; P < 0.001). The adenoma detection rate (ADR) was significantly higher in the AI-assisted colonoscopy group compared with the CC group (47.9% vs 38.5%; odds ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.05-2.41; P , 0.03).

17,"Background and Aim: The current recommendation for surveillance after achieving complete remission of intestinal metaplasia (CRIM) is to sample visible lesions, followed by random four-quadrant biopsies of neosquamous epithelium.1 We aimed to identify the endoscopic location, appearance, histology, and long-term outcomes of dysplastic recurrences to inform surveillance biopsy protocols after CRIM. Methods: We performed an analysis of a single Barrett's referral unit database of patients who underwent endoscopic eradication therapy (EET) for Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia or T1a adenocarcinoma between November 2008 and November 2021. Patients who achieved CRIM underwent surveillance endoscopy with an Olympus HQ-180 or HQ-190 gastroscope and a transparent cap. Visible lesions and any recurrent Barrett's (including Barrett's islands) were biopsied first, followed by four-quadrant biopsies taken every 1-2 cm, starting immediately distal to the neo-squamocolumnar junction (gastroesophageal junction), followed by the length of the original Barrett's esophagus segment. The endoscopic location, appearance, histology, and long-term outcomes of dysplastic recurrences were identified and assessed.

18,"5.5 years (SD, 2.9) after CRIM, 18 patients (8.3%) developed dysplasia recurrence. Of these patients, 10 (55.6%) had dysplasia recur at the gastroesophageal junction and eight (44.4%) in the tubular esophagus. Of the gastroesophageal junction recurrences, two (20%) were visible endoscopically (both were Paris 0-IIa lesions with loss of vascular and mucosal pattern). The remaining eight (80%) were detected on random biopsies just below the squamocolumnar junction. Of the eight recurrences in the tubular esophagus, all were visible endoscopically. Three were Paris 0-IIa or Paris 0-IIb Barrett's islands with surrounding buried Barrett's (Fig. 1), two were in Paris 0-IIb Barrett's islands with normal mucosal appearance, and three were in Paris 0-IIa or 0-IIb Barrett's islands with indistinct mucosal pattern (Fig. 2). Of all visible lesions, 81.8% were either high-grade dysplasia or worse. Ten (55.6%) had the same recurrence histology as their original histology, and four (22.2%) developed more advanced histology, including two patients who progressed to T3N2M0 and T1bN0M0 adenocarcinoma (both underwent definitive chemoradiotherapy). Seven patients re-achieved CRIM after EET, and eight were still undergoing EET at last follow-up. The remaining three patients died from lung cancer, heart failure, and pneumonia, respectively. Conclusion: The yield of random biopsies of normal-appearing tubular esophageal neosquamous epithelium was zero. Most recurrent high-grade dysplasia or cancerous lesions are in subtle visible lesions. Surveillance protocols should focus on vigilant inspection for visible lesions, especially subtle Barrett's islands and signs of sub-squamous Barrett's, with sampling of those lesions, followed by random gastroesophageal junction biopsies.",0.0,,False

37,"impact on both patient morbidity and the health care system. These adverse events are often deemed avoidable and commonly represent a breach in care quality and safety. Reported periendoscopy adverse events include hypotension, diabetic complications, respiratory distress, and cardiovascular complications. A review of the literature has shown that most studies either focus on a single periendoscopic issue or perioperative advice in general. There are no studies to date that focus on a holistic whole-process analysis of the patient journey, including the complex interactions involved in periendoscopic care. This study presents an accident causation analysis and multifaceted interventions to improve patient safety and quality during periendoscopic care. Methods: We analyzed case complications over a 3-year period from 2017 to 2020, using an accident causation model involving more than 15 000 endoscopic cases. From these cases, we identified the following: hypotension-related complications (presyncope, syncope, and falls resulting in musculoskeletal injury and fracture), airway complications (bronchospasm and aspiration), diabetic complications (hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and euglycemic ketoacidosis), and cardiovascular complications (myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular event). We applied a fishbone analysis to understand root causes and implement pre- and post-procedural management in an attempt to reduce complications. Results: Through our analysis, we implemented multifaceted interventions via a nurse-led assessment process, which included: withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers 2 days before the procedure for patients older than 50 years; altering split-dose bowel preparation and fasting times for those with abnormal gastric motility; withholding and altering diabetic management in consultation with general practitioners and endocrinologists; and implementing measures to minimize interruption of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. Over a 24-month period, 3289 patient cases were assessed and managed using this process. There were no reports of hypotension, airway, cardiovascular, or coagulation-related complications recorded. Diabetic complications were still noted, including two cases of hypoglycemia (range, 3-4 mmol/L) requiring no additional treatment, and one case of euglycemic ketoacidosis requiring a dextrose infusion and insulin, with the procedure proceeding following initiated therapy. Conclusion: Diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic procedures are safe and of high quality in Australia. However, there is room for improvement in terms of periendoscopic care, with a focus on improving the overall patient experience and journey throughout the endoscopic process.

Cap-assisted endoscopy has been shown to result in major papilla detection rates of 93-99%.3 Our study aimed to measure the cap-assisted major papilla detection rate (CaMPDR) in a cohort of patients examined in a non-expert center to establish a potential baseline for this quality indicator and to correlate this with the DADR. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent cap-assisted upper gastrointestinal endoscopies from January to December 2021. Data collection included age, sex, major papilla detection, presence of duodenal polyp, and duodenal adenoma detection on histology. All upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed by a single experienced gastroenterologist (at least 1000 endoscopies performed). Exclusion criteria included gastroscopies with altered anatomy, acute gastrointestinal bleeding, therapeutic procedures, aborted studies, follow-up studies, and surveillance procedures. Results: A total of 98 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age of the patients was 57.8 years, and 54% were female. Cap-assisted upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was able to identify the major papilla in 78.5% of cases. Of the 98 patients, duodenal polyps were found in 12 (12.2%), of whom four had duodenal adenomas with low-grade dysplasia (4.08%). There were no ampullary adenomas detected during the study period. Conclusion: The DADR in our cohort of patients undergoing cap-assisted endoscopy was 10-fold higher than that reported in the literature (4% vs 0.4%). This improvement was seen despite the CaMPDR being lower (78.5% vs 93%). Cap-assisted endoscopy appears to benefit both CaMPDR and DADR, with a CaMPDR as low as 80% correlating with a higher DADR.

52,"Case report: A 70-year-old woman presented for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for work-up of iron deficiency in the absence of any upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Her background was significant for bullous pemphigoid and starting doxycycline treatment 1 year prior. Of note, her iron deficiency was present before she started doxycycline. At gastroscopy, a well-demarcated 5-mm irregular area of granular mucosa with white discoloration was noted (Fig. 1a,b). Targeted biopsies of the lesion, as well as areas of adjacent normal-appearing antrum and body, were performed. Histology showed changes consistent with doxycycline-related gastric mucosal injury, including eroded and degenerate gastric specialized type mucosa with eosinophilic necrosis of superficial capillaries (Fig. 1c). Biopsies of the antrum and body showed mild chronic gastritis only, with no such changes. The doxycycline-induced gastric mucosal injury was thought unlikely to be the cause of the patient's presentation. However, following discussion with her dermatologist, a decision was made to replace the doxycycline with an alternative antibiotic, to reduce risk of further mucosal injury. A follow-up gastroscopy will be performed in 3 months to assess response. Conclusion: Doxycycline-related gastric injuries are rare, with only six case reports and one case series between 2002 and 2021, accounting for 16 individual cases. Esophageal injuries are more common and present with deep ulceration, whereas gastric injuries present with superficial necrosis and erosions. The mechanism of injury is poorly understood, with the localized nature of the injury suggesting it may be related to direct caustic effects from tablet stasis, similar to in the esophagus. This case highlights the classic presentation of doxycycline-induced gastric injury, making it easier for the endoscopist to identify this rare injury in future patients.",1.0,Case,True

This takes additional time and incurs a cost, with the diagnostic yield unknown. We aimed to determine the diagnostic yield for CD from routine duodenal biopsy in patients with normal duodenal mucosal appearance who are referred for gastroscopy to investigate upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms who had gastroscopy at our hospital between 1 January and 31 December 2018. We identified patient demographics, indications for gastroscopy, duodenal histology, and prior history of CD and celiac serology. Patients with known CD or abnormal duodenal mucosa at gastroscopy were excluded. Statistical analysis, including descriptive analysis and Pearson's 2 test for categorical variables, was performed using SPSS. Results: A total of 788 patients, including 328 (41.7%) male and 459 (58.3%) female patients, underwent gastroscopy during the study period. Median patient age was 57 years (range, 15-96).

80,"Background and Aim: Previous studies have shown that elevated blood urea nitrate level is a useful predictor of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (AUGIB); however, levels are often misinterpreted in the presence of acute and/or chronic kidney disease. A pilot study showed that a raised urea to creatinine ratio (UCR) can be superior to elevated blood urea nitrate level alone in identifying patents with AUGIB.1 At present, UCR is not commonly measured in Australia in the assessment of AUGIB. We aimed to evaluate whether UCR correlates with identification of culprit lesions and the need for endotherapy for patients presenting with presumed AUGIB. Methods: We conducted a retrospective electronic medical review of all patients presenting with overt AUGIB to a Brisbane emergency department (annual census, 77 000) who were admitted and received an inpatient gastroscopy over a 2-year period (July 2016 to June 2017, and July 2018 to June 2019). The 929-bed tertiary referral hospital provides an endoscopy unit service that performs more than 3000 gastroscopies annually and provides a 24-h/7-day on-call service. Demographic, clinical, and endoscopic data were collected and analyzed on consecutive presentations with AUGIB. UCR values (dividing urea [mmol/L] by creatinine [mol/L] and multiplying by 1000) were measured less than 12 h before endoscopy, and their accuracy in identification of lesions and intraluminal blood on gastroscopy, as well as need for endotherapy, were evaluated using non-parametric tests. Results: There were 309 presentations of patients with AUGIB. The study population had a mean age of 61 years. Of the 309 patients, 246 had UCR measured and were included in the analysis. Of the included patients, 161 (65.4%) were male. The mean UCR was 111 (SD, ± 64). Culprit lesions were identified in 219 patients (89.02%), with the most common source being an ulcer (70, 31.96%). Of these patients, 104 (47.5%) required endotherapy. Median UCR was higher in patients with culprit lesions than in those without culprit lesions (98 vs 67, P < 0.01). The median UCR in patients with culprit lesions requiring endotherapy was higher than in those not requiring endotherapy (131 vs 100, P ,"" 0.0003). Similarly, median UCR was higher in those with presence of intraluminal blood compared with those without presence of intraluminal blood (123 vs 86, P "","" 0.005). The median UCR in patients with variceal bleeding was higher than in those with non-variceal bleeding, but not significantly so (102 vs 90, P "", 0.96).

81,"Background and Aim: Esophageal food impaction is estimated to have an annual incidence of 13-25 per 100 000 and has a wide variability in presentation, as well as therapeutic gastroscopy time. The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommends that therapeutic gastroscopy should be performed within 6 h and 24 h for food bolus (FB) impaction that causes complete and incomplete esophageal obstruction, respectively. We aimed to investigate whether adults presenting with an acute esophageal FB impaction have increased negative outcomes or length of hospital stay (LOS) if their therapeutic gastroscopy is outside of recommended guidelines. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 119 patients who presented between 2019 and 2022 with symptoms of FB impaction. Ethics approval was obtained from the local research ethics committee. Clinical data included age, time from FB ingestion to emergency department (ED) presentation, type of FB, glucagon use, evidence of complete obstruction, time from ED presentation to endoscopy, biopsy, endoscopic technique, esophageal abnormalities, complications, and LOS. Complete obstruction was defined as inability to swallow saliva. LOS was categorized as same-day discharge, next day (within 24 h), or longer than 24 h. Complications were defined as local esophageal complications (erosions, ulcerations; Grade 1), tears (Grade 2), and perforations (Grade 3), with aspiration as a separate category. Results: Overall, 119 patients underwent gastroscopy for FB impaction, with 88 having confirmed impaction on gastroscopy. The mean patient age was 59.3 years (19-98), and most (64.7%) were male. Type of FB was predominantly meat (82.4%). Glucagon was given to 59 patients (49.6%), of whom 37 (62.7%) had complete obstruction, with 13 (35.1%) passing the FB before gastroscopy. More than half (n ,"" 67) had a previous history of FB impaction, and 66 presented with a complete FB impaction. The endoscopic technique most used was the Olympus distal attachment (D-206-04) (38, 31.9%). Biopsy samples were taken in 55 cases, with 29.1% having confirmed eosinophilic esophagitis. Grade 1 complications were the most prevalent (31.1%), followed by Grade 2 (8.4%), with no Grade 3 complications. Only two patients had aspiration events: both had gastroscopy completed outside the recommended timeframe and had an LOS of within 24 h and longer than 24 h. About two-thirds of patients (80, 68.4%) left the same day as the gastroscopy; a further 17.9% left within 24 h and 13.7% left after 24 h. Of the 66 patients with complete obstruction, 26 (39.4%) had therapeutic gastroscopy performed within the recommended 6 h; for the 53 patients with incomplete obstructions, 88.7% had gastroscopy performed within the recommended 24 h (Fig. 1).

Participants who underwent empirical dilatation were divided into those with (ED-T) and without mucosal tears (ED-NT) on relook and were also compared with those who underwent dilatation of visible strictures (VS). Primary outcomes were post-dilatation total dysphagia score and successful therapeutic response, defined as reduction in total dysphagia score by  3 after dilatation, or to 0 if baseline dysphagia score was < 3. Results: A total of 138 dilatations were performed in 103 dilatation series among 98 patients (55% male; mean age, 55.4 ± 18.1 years) (Table 1). There were 68 empirical dilatations (66%), while 35 dilatations (34%) were of VS. While all dilatations of VS resulted in a mucosal tear on relook endoscopy, only 40 (58.8%) of those empirically dilated had a mucosal tear. Mean dysphagia scores before dilatation were 5.83 ± 1.77, 5.55 ± 1.62, and 5.07 ± 2.09 in the VS, ED-T, and ED-NT groups, respectively (P ,"" 0.25). After dilatation, short-term follow-up was available for 30/35 patients with VS (86%), 37/40 patients with ED-T (93%), and 20/28 patients with ED-NT (71%). Mean post-dilatation dysphagia scores differed significantly between the three groups (VS, 1.03 ± 1.63; ED-T, 1.62 ± 2.39; ED-NT, 4.00 ± 2.88; P < 0.001 by one-way ANOVA). On pairwise comparison using Tukey's test, post-dilatation dysphagia scores were significantly worse in ED-NT patients compared with both ED-T and VS patients (P < 0.001 for both). However, ED-T and VS patients had comparable symptomatic response to dilatation (P "", 0.61). The proportion with successful therapeutic response among ED-T patients (81%) was comparable to VS participants (90%; P ,"" 0.31). In contrast, successful therapeutic response was achieved in significantly fewer ED-NT patients (35%; P < 0.001 by 2). Of those who had empirical dilatation with mucosal tear, 20 (50%) had a prior endoscopy performed by another physician where no cause for dysphagia was deemed present. Of those who had dilatation of VS, 12 (34%) had an unexpected second mucosal tear, highlighting the value of bougie dilatation of the entire esophagus. Conclusion: A mucosal tear following empirical esophageal dilatation predicts a favorable symptomatic response, comparable to that seen following dilatation of visible esophageal strictures. In contrast, absence of mucosal tear predicts poor response. These findings support the utility of empirical dilatation with relook endoscopy for solid-food dysphagia.""",1.0,symptomatic,True

144,"Background and Aim: A multitude of advanced mucosal imaging technologies have been developed with the aim of improving adenoma detection during colonoscopy. In many cases, the efficacy of these technologies has been limited by either a reduction in brightness or a less-familiar color spectrum limiting lesion detection, particularly among noninterventionalist endoscopists. Texture and color enhancement imaging (TXI) is a new imaging technology that was developed with the aim of enhancing mucosal visualization without compromising the familiarity of the color spectrum. This study aimed to assess whether the use of TXI is superior to white-light imaging (WLI) in the detection of adenomas during colonoscopy. Methods: Patients undergoing colonoscopy at a single tertiary center in South Australia were prospectively recruited and randomized to either TXI or WLI. Patients with known inflammatory bowel disease or hereditary polyposis syndromes were excluded from the study. Once the colonoscope had been inserted to the cecum, a stopwatch was started, and either TXI or WLI was used whenever the proceduralist was examining for polyps. When a polyp was found, the stopwatch was paused, and alternative forms of advanced mucosal imaging could be used for the purpose",1.0,case,True
145,"of polyp interrogation. Once polypectomy and retrieval were complete, the stopwatch was restarted and the designated imaging was again used. ""Withdrawal time"" therefore refers to the time spent on polyp detection only, with a target withdrawal time of at least 7 min. Only polyps that were resected, retrieved, and confirmed histologically were included in the analysis. Fisher's exact tests were used for categorical variables and unpaired t-tests for continuous variables. This is an interim analysis of an ongoing clinical trial. Results: A total of 216 patients gave consent to be included in the study, with 10 excluded: seven because of inadequate bowel preparation (Boston Bowel Preparation Score < 6) and three because of incomplete procedures. Of the 206 patients included, 117 were randomized to WLI and 89 to TXI. There were no significant differences in age, sex, indication, or bowel preparation between the WLI and TXI groups (Table 1). Withdrawal time was marginally longer (median, 18 s) in the WLI group. The adenoma detection rate (ADR) was higher with TXI than WLI (58% vs 40%, P ,"" 0.01). The mean number of adenomas detected per colonoscopy (APC) was also higher with TXI (2.02; 95% CI, 1.34-2.71) than WLI (0.97; 95% CI, 0.68-1.26; P < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, the factors significantly associated with an increased ADR were the use of TXI (odds ratio [OR], 3.7; P < 0.01), increasing age (OR, 1.04; P "","" 0.02), male sex (OR, 2.81; P < 0.01), and longer withdrawal time (OR, 1.007; P "","" 0.01). The impact of TXI remained significant in the non-interventionalist endoscopist group, with a mean APC of 1.75, compared with 0.9 for WLI (P "","" 0.048). Conclusion: The use of TXI improved the ADR and the APC when compared with WLI, despite a shorter median withdrawal time. Use of this technology should not be limited to interventional endoscopists, as the impact remained significant for non-interventionalists.

We present a novel case of IUS-guided PEG tube insertion in a patient at high risk of adjacent organ injury. Case report: A 79-year-old man was referred for percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy (PEG-J) insertion due to a history of severe reflux and regurgitation, complicated by an empyema secondary to aspiration pneumonitis. This was on a background of an emergency laparotomy for severe necrotizing pancreatitis 4 years earlier. Three years later, he had a localized",1.0,disease,True
174,"surgical resection (Sweet esophagectomy) for T2N0M0 gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. A more extensive resection or dissection of the colon and mesentery off the stomach was not possible due to significant adhesions. This resulted in a non-contracting lower esophageal sphincter, as well as gastroparesis thought to be due to vagal nerve injury and adhesions. After surgery, the patient had clinical and endoscopic evidence of large-volume gastroesophageal reflux and regurgitation, requiring high-dose acid suppression and behavioral modification. He presented to hospital with an empyema secondary to aspiration pneumonia and underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic decortication and pleurodesis. On recovery, PEG-J tube insertion was planned to provide enteral nutrition beyond the stomach, thereby reducing stomach contents and the potential for significant aspiration episodes in the future. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen showed several loops of large bowel adherent to the stomach wall and a small potential window for PEG tube insertion (Fig. 1). IUS was therefore performed during PEG tube insertion to identify the stomach and intervening structures and reduce the risk of inadvertent bowel injury. A 20-Fr PEG with jejunal extension tube was placed using the pull-through technique. A potential window for insertion was first localized by transillumination and direct abdominal pressure conductance. Subsequently, IUS was able to identify the left lobe of the liver (Fig. 2) and transverse colon (Fig. 3) within the transilluminated region. A suitable location with no intervening colon or viscera was identified on IUS, and a PEG-J tube placed by standard aseptic technique (Fig. 4). The final PEG",1.0,clinical,True

202,"Background and Aim: The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care set standards for colonoscopy performance. These standards relate to all aspects of routine colonoscopy: consent, quality of bowel preparation, documentation of procedure, and detection of polyps.1 The aim of this study was to retrospectively audit compliance with Australian Clinical Care Standards 6 and 7, with emphasis on procedural recertification targets, and to investigate complications at our center. Methods: We analyzed consecutive colonoscopies at a tertiary referral center between May and August 2021. Demographic, endoscopic, and histological data, including cecal and terminal ileal intubation, polyp detection rate (in patients aged over 50 years), presence of cancer, and complications, were extracted from the digital medical record. Cecal documentation was defined as photographic evidence identifying the appendiceal orifice and triradiate folds. Complications were defined as mortality, failure to complete the procedure due to an adverse event, or requiring hospital re-presentation from a procedure-related condition. Results: A total of 308 colonoscopies were performed by eight gastroenterologists. Tubular adenoma (TA) and sessile serrated polyp (SSP) detection rates were 51.7% and 9.2%, respectively (Table 1). Complications occurred in four of the 308 procedures: one mucosal tear and early termination of the procedure; one post-polypectomy bleed necessitating admission; one admission for aspiration pneumonia following panendoscopy (during monitored anesthesia); and one syncope after bowel preparation, with distal fibula fracture. There was no perforation or mortality. Conclusion: This audit shows that TA and SSP detection and completion rates were higher than the national recertification standard and comparable to those reported in the literature for similar cohorts.2,3 Complication rates were low and comparable to expected rates.

Current guidelines recommend withholding SGLT2-I for at least 2 days before surgery, but the evidence for this recommendation in routine outpatient colonoscopy is limited.

Clinically significant ketosis was defined as ketone levels > 1.0 mmol/L. Decisions regarding subsequent blood gas analysis and delaying or canceling procedures were made by the treating anesthetist. Results: A total of 315 individuals were consecutively recruited; 179 (56.83%) were female. Sixty-nine patients (21.9%) had diabetes, and 17 (5.4%) were taking SGLT2-I. The mean age was 57.79 ± 15.21 years. The mean values for capillary ketone levels among patients without diabetes, patients with diabetes on SGLT2-I, and patients with diabetes not on SGLT2-I were 0.62, 1.05, and 0.56, respectively. Ketone levels > 1.0 mmol/L were noted in 41 individuals (13.0%). Of these, 13 (33%) were diabetic, with ketosis ranging from 1.0 to 4.2 mmol/L. The range of ketosis in the 28 patients without diabetes was 1.0-5.7 mmol/L. Age (P ,"" 0.58), sex, body mass index, use of oral hypoglycemics (P "","" 0.40), and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification score were not predictive of increased risk of developing ketosis. Only a diagnosis of T2DM and increased fasting times (> 45 min) conferred a greater trend towards ketosis risk. Patients with T2DM as a whole were 2.06 times more likely to develop ketosis with or without SGLT2-I. This did not reach statistical significance (P "","" 0.05). Delays to procedure occurred for three patients due to ketosis. Two of these patients had diabetes on SGLT2-I and developed mild acidosis, requiring reversal with insulin and dextrose. One patient did not have diabetes. None of the procedures were canceled. Conclusion: This study showed a wide range of capillary ketone concentrations in patients with and without diabetes who underwent bowel preparation for colonoscopies. Clinically insignificant periprocedural ketosis commonly occurs in patients with or without T2DM. Although there may be a greater trend in patients with diabetes, especially those on SGLT2-I, this phenomenon is not unique to this subgroup. The relatively short fasting and procedure times, as well as the utility of conscious sedation rather than general anesthesia, is unique to colonoscopies and should be a consideration in risk assessment. The presence of ketosis in patients with T2DM who had their SGLT2-I withheld should not be a contraindication to proceeding safely to colonoscopies, provided that excess procedural delays are avoided and patients are able to recommence oral intake early after the procedure.""",1.0,Clinical,True

Results: A total of 743 patients (356 [48%] female, 391 [52%] male) were admitted with acute pancreatitis. The median age was 46 years, and 295 patients (39%) were aged 60 years or older. The most common cause of pancreatitis was gallstones, accounting for 243 patients (33%), followed by idiopathic pancreatitis (204, (27%), and alcoholic pancreatitis (143, 19%). Less common causes included hypercalcemia (3, < 1%), autoimmune pancreatitis (2, < 1%), pancreatic divisum (5, < 1%), and drug-induced pancreatitis (9, 1%). Five drug-induced pancreatitis cases were due to corticosteroids, with the others due to mesalazine, azathioprine, daratumumab, and dual incretin therapy (one case each). In terms of BISAP scores, 299 patients (40%) had a score of 0; 270 (37%) had a score of 1, 101 (14%) had a score of 2, 54 (7%) had a score of 3, 17 (2%) had a score of 4, and two (< 1%) had a score of 5. Mean length of stay was 4 days for those with BISAP 0, 6 days for BISAP 1, 11 days for BISAP 2, 17 days for BISAP 3, and 14 days for BISAP 4 and 5. There were 75 patients (11%) who required admission to the high dependency/intensive care unit. Fifteen patients with pancreatitis died. Seventy (9%) developed necrotizing pancreatitis. Ninety-six patients (13%) developed peripancreatic collections. Thirteen patients (14%) with peripancreatic collections underwent drainage. Nine patients had endoscopic drainage (five with plastic stents, and four with a lumen-apposing metal stent) and four had percutaneous drainage inserted. Six patients required repeat endoscopic drainage, and one required repeat percutaneous drainage. The median number of days from admission to drainage was 19 (IQR, 12.75-24). Forty-three patients (6%) had TG-related pancreatitis. Nineteen (44%) of these were recurrent TG-related pancreatitis. Mean TG level was 30 mmol/L (upper limit of normal, 1.7 mmol/L). Thirty patients with TG-related pancreatitis (88%) had metabolic syndrome. Twelve patients (29%) had concomitant diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Of the patients with TG-related pancreatitis, 74% were treated with an insulin infusion, 74% received statin therapy, 81% received fenofibrate, and 81% received fish oil. Conclusion: Gallstones and idiopathic pancreatitis were the leading causes of acute pancreatitis in our cohort. TG-related pancreatitis represented a small but notable number of cases within our cohort.

Meticulous manual review is required to clarify histology, examine procedure indication, and clarify whether the colon is intact. We aimed to assess whether calculating ADR and SSLDR while including non-intact colons would alter conclusions about the overall performance of colonoscopists. Methods: All consecutive patients aged > 50 years who underwent colonoscopy from 1 January to 31 December 2021 at two tertiary hospitals were included. Procedures performed by colonoscopists performing < 50 colonoscopies during the study period and patients with a previous diagnosis of IBD were excluded. Individuals undergoing > 1 procedure during the study period were analyzed as separate cases. ADR and SSLDR were calculated as the number of histologically confirmed adenomas or sessile serrated lesions divided by the total number of colonoscopies performed. Polyp histology and data on previous colonic resection were confirmed by interrogation of endoscopy and pathology data by clinical surveillance nurses. Results: A total of 5399 colonoscopies performed by 34 colonoscopists met the study criteria. Of these, 246 colonoscopies (4.5%) were performed in patients with non-intact colons. The overall ADR and SSLDR were 53.1% (95% CI, 51.8-54.5%) and 15.2% (95% CI, 14.3-16.2%), respectively. The ADR (53.1% vs 53.6%; P , 0.61) and SSLDR (15.2% vs 15.4%; P ,"" 0.79) were similar for all colonoscopies compared with those with intact colons alone (Table 1). There was a trend towards lower ADR and SSLDR in the subgroup of patients with non-intact colons, compared with patients with intact colons. The range of colonoscopies performed on non-intact colons by individual colonoscopists was 0.8% to 32%, with the median value for all proceduralists being 3.6%. Non-intact colons comprised < 10% of the workload for 30 of the 34 colonoscopists. Conclusion: There was no significant difference between the ADR and SSLDR regardless of whether non-intact colons were included or excluded in unit performance assessment. This is similar to a previous study, where non-intact colons comprised 10.7% of the total colonoscopies, but no significant difference in the overall ADR was found.2 Overall, patients with non-intact colons make up a small proportion of our cohort and do not appear to significantly alter the results. At an individual level, the average colonoscopist's workload included a small proportion of non-intact colons. Although larger studies with subgroup analyses would aid the generalizability of this result, we propose that inclusion of non-intact colons in ADR and SSLDR calculations may simplify measurements and increase opportunities for quality assessments, which allows endoscopy units to evaluate colonoscopy data more pragmatically.""",1.0,case,True

255,"Background and Aim: Globally, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to Helicobacter pylori has been increasing, and H. pylori is now recognized as a high-priority AMR pathogen, alongside methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. However, H. pylori attracts relatively little attention. Current Australian therapeutic guidelines recommend levofloxacin-based triple therapy (levofloxacin, amoxicillin, and a proton pump inhibitor [PPI]) for 10 days or quadruple therapy (bismuth subcitrate, tetracycline, metronidazole, and a PPI) as second-line salvage therapy, but these recommendations are based on data that are more than 20 years old. Levofloxacin is not available in Australia; moxifloxacin is often substituted, despite data regarding AMR of H. pylori to moxifloxacin. Bismuth is not on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and is only available through a Special Access Scheme. It is therefore not readily available and is poorly tolerated due to suboptimal adherence and adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal and taste disturbance. Taken together, this highlights the need for updated Australian treatment guidelines. The aim of this study was to perform a retrospective analysis at a single tertiary hospital to describe the management (and success where available) of H. pylori infection resistant to first-line therapy. Methods: Patients with confirmed H. pylori on gastric biopsies between 2010 and 2021 at our tertiary center were identified from pathology databases. Patients for this study were selected from a cohort of these patients who were confirmed to have failed first-line therapy on breath testing to repeat gastric biopsy after eradication therapy. Subsequent treatment regimens, treatment duration, and success were recorded. Results: A total of 216 H. pylori-positive patients received documented first-line eradication therapy and had a treatment outcome. Of these, 69 patients (32%) had documented failure of first-line therapy and were included in this analysis. Table 1 summarizes the salvage treatment regimens and outcomes. Overall confirmed treatment success was 68% (47/69), with five confirmed treatment failures (7%), and 17 patients (25%) lost to follow-up. Of the patients in whom first-line therapy failed, only 13 (19%) underwent formal culture and susceptibility testing, usually after multiple treatment failures. Conclusion: A minority of patients were treated with salvage therapy as per current Australian therapeutic guidelines. Moxifloxacin-based therapy was the most frequently used retreatment regimen and was successful in most patients, with only two true treatment failures. Multiple other treatment regimens of different combination of antibiotics and for different durations were used. Few patients underwent culture and susceptibility testing",1.0,positive,True

277,"Background and Aim: Guidelines recommend routine gastrointestinal endoscopy to investigate the cause of iron deficiency anemia (IDA). However, gastrointestinal endoscopy is also often performed to investigate iron deficiency in the absence of anemia (ID) and non-iron deficiency anemia (non-ID anemia), with unclear recommendations from expert bodies and few studies comparing the diagnostic yield for these indications. Furthermore, demand for endoscopy continues to increase, along with challenges in completing the procedures within the timeframe of their urgency category. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic yield of gastrointestinal endoscopy for IDA, ID, and non-ID anemia found during elective endoscopy and to identify factors contributing to cancer or other significant findings, to assist with risk stratification. Methods: A 12-month retrospective single-center cohort study was undertaken in 2019 (before the COVID-19 era) at a large Australian quaternary health service.

Results: A total of 296 patients were included in the analysis. Of these, 142 (48.0%) had IDA, 98 (33.1%) had ID, and 56 (18.9%) had non-ID anemia. There was a greater proportion of women in the ID group (62.2%), compared with the IDA (46.5%, P ,"" 0.018) and non-ID anemia (42.9%, P "","" 0.028) groups.

Conclusion: Gastrointestinal endoscopy identifies significant endoscopic findings in more than 65% of patients undergoing investigation for iron deficiency and/or anemia. The majority of these findings are non-serious, and the prevalence appears similar in patients with IDA, ID, and non-ID anemia. However, there is a trend towards reduced cancer prevalence in patients with ID compared with IDA, although the overall numbers of cancers were small in this study population.

286,"Background and Aim: Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a common presentation to the emergency department (ED) and often necessitates admission and access to endoscopy. Recent Australian data have reported the rebleeding rate at 30 days to be 4.3%.1 In this single-center study in a tertiary care hospital, we sought to analyze 2 years of UGIB presentations to the ED to determine the risk of rebleeding and to describe factors associated with it. Methods: All consecutive patients presenting to the ED with overt gastrointestinal bleeding over a 2-year period (July 2016 to June 2017 and July 2018 to June 2019) were included in the study. The facility is a 929-bed tertiary referral hospital in Brisbane, Australia, which has an ED annual census of over 77 000 presentations. The gastroenterology unit performs more than 4000 upper endoscopies per year and provides a 24/7 on-call service. Demographic, clinical, and endoscopic data were collected for all patients. All case notes were reviewed to ensure patients were not misclassified. The primary outcome measure was 30-day rebleeding rate. Rebleeding was defined as either a re-presentation to the ED with an episode of overt UGIB and a drop in hemoglobin (Hb) level > 20 g/dL since last measurement at discharge from index bleed, or re-presenting with UGIB and an Hb drop < 20 g/dL in patients who received an endoscopy and endotherapy for the rebleeding. Secondary outcomes included volume of blood product resuscitation, time to endoscopy, need for endoscopic treatment, mortality, and history of antithrombotic medication. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Results: A total of 358 patients presented to the ED with overt UGIB. The median age was 55 years (IQR, 40-72), and 61.2% were male. Presenting symptoms of melena, hematemesis, and hematochezia were present in 56.4%, 68.2%, and 5.9% of patients, respectively. In terms of treatment, 20.4% and 16.2% of patients were taking aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitors, respectively, and 21.2% of patients were anticoagulated on admission. Median Glasgow-Blatchford Score was 7 (IQR, 2-11), and median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 3 (IQR, 0-5). Overall, gastroscopy was performed in 233 patients (65.1%).

A recent meta-analysis showed that colorectal cancer screening has decreased by 28-100% in different countries and at various times after the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak.1 In South Australia, the total number of colonoscopies decreased by 51% in 2020, compared with 2019.2 In 2019, a strategic shift to decentralize elective colonoscopy service in the Top End Health Service (TEHS) from Royal Darwin Hospital (RDH), a tertiary hospital, to Palmerston Regional Hospital (PRH), a regional hospital, was made. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the activity level in all hospitals in the TEHS, assess the impact of the strategic shift, and provide insights on how to maintain an effective colonoscopy service. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of colonoscopy data from 2018 to 2021 from all four hospitals in the TEHS: RDH, PRH, Katherine Hospital, and Gove District Hospital (GDH). The number of colonoscopies performed by each hospital was recorded. Variation in activity of colonoscopy from the previous year was calculated as a percentage difference. Results: In 2020, the total number of colonoscopies decreased by 20% compared with 2019 (Fig. 1). There was a slight overall recovery of 3% in 2021 compared with 2020. GDH, located in a remote community, continued to have a reduced capacity, by 9% in 2020 and 15% in 2021 (Fig. 1).

347,"Background and Aim: Esophageal food bolus obstruction (EFBO) is a common presenting problem to emergency departments worldwide. There is a paucity of data relating to efficacy of pre-endoscopic and endoscopic management, resulting in a wide variety of clinical practice. Consensus guidelines do not advocate strongly for pre-endoscopic medications, but they remain commonly used. The aim of this project was to evaluate the natural history, management, and outcomes of patients presenting with EFBO and to establish the efficacy of pre-endoscopic and endoscopic treatment options. Methods: This project was a retrospective audit of patients who were admitted with a food bolus impaction at two large tertiary centers from 2010 to 2021. International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes were used to identify adult patients aged  18 years admitted with EFBO. Medical records were reviewed to determine baseline characteristics, medical and endoscopic treatments, and outcomes. A subgroup analysis compared patients who passed the EFBO without endoscopic intervention with patients who required endoscopy. A multivariate logistical regression analysis was performed. Results: A total of 675 patients (median age, 55 years; 67% male) were included. Of these, 222 patients (33%) had a prior history of EFBO, 119 (17%) had gastroesophageal reflux disease, and 90 (13%) had asthma. No differences in baseline characteristics were noted between patients who spontaneously cleared the obstruction and those who required endoscopy. Median length of stay was 2 days (IQR, 1-2). There were 432 patients (64%) who received a mean of two pre-endoscopic medications. Glucagon (46%), glyceryl trinitrate (36%), and Coca Cola (37%) were most commonly administered. No medication significantly reduced the need for endoscopic intervention. Multivariable analysis showed that tolerating saliva (odds ratio [OR], 1.95; P ,"" 0.025) and liquids (OR, 2.28; P "","" 0.001) significantly predicted spontaneous resolution of the EFBO without endoscopy. A total of 461 patients (68%) required endoscopy, with a median time to endoscopy of 12.7 h, and 37% were intubated. The EFBO was most often located in the lower esophagus (32%). Endoscopic complications were rare, with 20 patients sustaining partial esophageal tears and five having aspiration pneumonia. The most common endoscopic findings were esophagitis (24%) and esophageal strictures (12%), with two esophageal tumors identified. Esophageal biopsy samples were taken in 158 cases (34%), and 36% showed eosinophilic esophagitis. Conclusion: Medical management is commonly trialed in patients with EFBO, but efficacy is poor. Patients' clinical symptoms, in particular the ability to tolerate saliva or liquids, are the best predictor for spontaneous EFBO clearance. Most patients with EFBO require endoscopy, which is highly effective and has a low complication rate.""",1.0,clinical,True

355,"Background and Aim: Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in Australia. Australians living in rural and remote areas generally have poorer access to health services than those in metropolitan areas. We aimed to determine if rurality affected the provision of colonoscopy in the Top End Health Service (TEHS). Methods: All episodes of colonoscopy performed in the TEHS from 2017 to 2021 were identified. Suburbs and localities of each patient were categorized based on the Modified Monash Model (MMM) of rurality, for which TEHS has categories 2, 5, 6, and 7. Rates of colonoscopies (per 1000 people) were calculated against the population estimates derived from the 2016 Australian Census for each category of MMM. We used 2 and Fisher's exact tests to determine whether the rates of colonoscopy differed significantly between each category of MMM. Results: A total of 9629 episodes of colonoscopy of 6128 unique patients were identified from 2017 to 2021. Colonoscopy was performed in the following four hospitals: Royal Darwin Hospital (MMM, 2), Palmerston Regional Hospital (MMM, 2), Katherine Hospital (MMM, 6), and Gove District Hospital (MMM, 7). The percentages of colonoscopies performed at each hospital were 36%, 53%, 6%, and 5%, respectively. Overall, 2 statistics suggested a significant difference in rates of colonoscopy between each category of the MMM (P < 0.001) (Table 1). This observation was significant in the remote (MMM, 6) and very remote (MMM, 7) communities compared with regional centers (MMM, 2) and remained relatively unchanged over the 5-year period. However, there was an increase in colonoscopy rates for people who lived in small rural towns (MMM, 5), likely attributable to the increase in colonoscopy capacity in our regional hospital (Palmerston Regional Hospital), which is about 3 h away. Conclusion: Our study showed ongoing health care inequities in regard to access to colonoscopy, especially in remote and very remote communities of the Northern Territory.

357,"Background and Aim: Climate change is directly linked to health outcomes, with disproportionate impact on Indigenous and low-medium Human Development Index populations. Endoscopy services have been identified as one of the top three highest waste-generating hospital departments.1 This quality improvement project takes the recommendations of others to provide an example of how to practically improve the sustainability of the endoscopy service in a rural district general hospital in Aotearoa-New Zealand.1,2 The project uses a pro-equity climate change approach to ensure improvement of Indigenous health.3 Methods: We created a process map of the patient journey within endoscopy. This identified three specific metrics: patient travel distances, procedure-associated landfill waste, and paper use. The data collected were converted to provide carbon emission figures across a single week of 16-22 May 2022. Travel distances were calculated using home addresses accessed from patient electronic records and assumed a direct return to hospital using Google Maps. Waste weight was quantified using a single calibrated set of scales in the unit, with the contents of bins being weighed before disposal. Waste that was potentially recyclable was separated out and measured. The weight of paper generated from referral, discharge, and procedure reports was also quantified. The carbon output was calculated using emission factors provided by the Aotearoa-New Zealand government.4 Results: For the week observed, a total of 4195.32 km were traveled to access endoscopy services. This produced 1.125 tCO2e in emissions. It was calculated that having an additional endoscopy service in the region could reduce emissions each week by 45.2% to 0.617 tCO2e (Fig. 1). In the same period, 1.85 kg of paper was produced for endoscopy reports and admission paperwork. This could be decreased by 1.63 kg (88.1%) each week if reports were not printed and were instead accessed electronically. During the study week, 58.6 kg (0.014 kgCO2e) of waste was produced, at least 11.3 kg of which was recyclable. Conclusion: There are clear areas that can be targeted to move towards a greener endoscopy service. In a year, the introduction of an additional peripheral endoscopy service could reduce emissions by 26.4 tCO2e (45.2%).",1.0,area,True

Procedures with poor or inadequate preparation or where cecal intubation was not achieved were excluded. Primary outcomes included polyp detection rate (PDR), adenoma detection rate (ADR), and sessile serrated adenoma detection rate (SSADR), compared between the two study periods. Statistical significance was evaluated using the 2 test with a threshold of P < 0.05. Results: Between January and April 2021, 972 complete colonoscopies were performed using the Olympus 190 series. The proportion of female patients was 57% (556/972), with a mean age of 57 years. The PDR was 58%, the ADR was 50.5%, and the SSADR was 16.5%.

403,"Background and Aim: Fatigue can have a significant impact on workers' performance. However, this has not been studied among colonoscopists. Our hypothesis was that the day of the week may influence colonoscopy quality indicators. We aimed to determine the relationship between colonoscopy polyp detection rate (PDR), adenoma detection rate (ADR), and sessile serrated lesion detection rate (SSLDR) and the days of the week. ADR and SSLDR are both quality indicators for colonoscopy and are now required for recertification. As sessile serrated lesions are often harder to detect than adenomas, SSLDR may be particularly vulnerable to fatigue. Methods: This is a single-center retrospective study looking at the endoscopy database from a metropolitan teaching hospital in Queensland. Data from Provation MD and electronic medical records were used to collect biochemical, histological, and endoscopic data between January and December 2021. All complete colonoscopies with adequate bowel preparation within the study period were included. Colonoscopies without preparation data and those with poor or inadequate preparation were excluded. Statistical analysis using the 2 test was used to examine differences between the PDR, ADR, and SSLDR for each day of the week.

Statistical significance was analyzed using the 2 test of independence using a threshold of P < 0.05. Results: Between January and December 2021, a total of 4012 colonoscopies were performed. After applying the exclusion criteria (missing bowel preparation data and incomplete colonoscopy), the remaining 3541 colonoscopies were included in the analysis. The proportion of female patients was 53% (1851/3541), with a mean patient age of 56.9 years. The ADR increased from 47.4% (924/1948) in the morning list to 51.4% (819/1593) in the afternoon list (Table 1). In addition, the SSADR increased significantly from 13.4% (262/1948) to 19% (302/1593). The PDR was comparable between the morning and afternoon lists, at 56.7% (1104/1948) and 58% (924/1593), respectively.

Conclusion: Despite previous literature suggesting worsening colonoscopy performance throughout the day, primarily attributed to proceduralist fatigue, our single-center experience surprisingly appears to suggest otherwise. Our results indicate that, with appropriate fatigue management measures in place, loss in colonoscopy performance can be attenuated. At our unit, this includes departmental training on fatigue management, ensuring adequate breaks between lists, and regular technical training opportunities to maintain colonoscopy proficiency.

429,"Methods: We conducted a retrospective audit and data extraction from the endoscopy (Provation MD) and other clinical databases in a metropolitan teaching hospital in Queensland that performs more than 6000 colonoscopies per year. The GEO platform is a set of culturally sensitive, patient-centered videos sent as a link from the hospital scheduling system in a letter, email, and embedded SMS to patients preparing for colonoscopy. Subsequently, telehealth consultations were performed by senior nurses, doctors, and pharmacists, replacing conventional face-to-face appointments. Anticoagulant and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor management was individualized in consultation with appropriate specialists. Standardized preparation kits were used, and scripts were sent to the patient or to the local pharmacy. Home postcode data were extracted and, using geolocation, distances to and from the hospital were calculated. Most patients attended the hospital by car. The National Transport Commission have quoted CO2 emissions for cars to be 149.5 g/km. Results: GEO has prevented 14 197 car journeys and 268 481 km of road use, avoided 40.14 tonnes of CO2 generation, and created more than 987 extra productive working days (Table 1). Conclusion: The reduction in CO2 emission was achieved by the GEO platform supporting telehealth interactions, replacing conventional patient and carer face-to-face attendance. This has led to improved patient and carer education, with a focus on First Nations health, improved patient-reported experience measures, patient-reported outcome measures, and colonoscopy key performance indicators, including a marked (50%) reduction in poor preparation rates, thus improving efficiency for patients, carers, system providers, and the climate.",1.0,clinical,True

Lau et al. found that urgent endoscopy performed within 6 h did not reduce mortality when compared with endoscopy performed between 6 and 24 h.1 Best practice suggests that endoscopy be performed within 24 h. We aimed to undertake a retrospective comparative analysis of timing of endoscopy provided for UGIB at a metropolitan teaching hospital in Queensland before and after April 2020. Methods: Data for patients admitted with UGIB between April 2018 and March 2019 (Cohort 1) were analyzed and compared with data from April 2021 to March 2022 (Cohort 2). Endoscopic, administrative, biochemical, and radiological data were collected from Provation MD and other clinical medical databases. Patients admitted from the emergency department with melena, hematemesis, coffee-ground emesis, or suspected UGIB were included. Patients who had been in hospital for longer than 48 h, outpatients, and those with an endoscopy indication other than bleeding were excluded. For each patient, age, Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS), hemoglobin level (on admission), endoscopy indication, endoscopic findings, treatment, timing of endoscopy, all-cause 30-day mortality, and 30-day repeat procedures were noted. Results: In Cohort 1, 84 patients met the inclusion criteria; their mean ± SD age was 65 ± 18 years, and they had a mean GBS of 10 ± 3.8. Mean timing to endoscopy was 13.9 ± 12.8 h; 70 (83%) were performed within 24 h of admission. Thirty (36%) were performed within 6 h, eight (10%) between 6 and 12 h, 32 (38%) between 12 and 24 h, and 14 (17%) after 24 h. Lesions were detected in 76 endoscopies (90%), with 42 patients (50%) requiring hemostatic treatment. Five patients (6%) died within 30 day of any cause, and six patients (7%) required further endoscopic intervention within 30 days. In Cohort 2, 128 patients met the inclusion criteria; their mean age was 68 ± 16 years, and they had a mean GBS of 9.5 ± 4.3. Mean timing to endoscopy was 17.8 ± 12.2 h; 101 (79%) were performed within 24 h of admission. Twenty-six (20%) were performed within 6 h, 15 (12%) between 6 and 12 h, 60 (47%) between 12 and 24 h, and 27 (21%) after 24 h. Lesions were detected in 105 endoscopies (82%), with 38 (30%) patients requiring hemostatic treatment. Eight patients (6%) died within 30 day of any cause, and 16 patients (12%) required further endoscopic intervention within 30 days. Conclusion: The timing of endoscopies for UGIB has been noted to have changed, possibly as a consequence of international consensus. Longer periods of acid suppression before endoscopy have been noted, and this has led to a reduction in the need for hemostatic intervention during endoscopy.

442,"Background and Aim: Sessile serrated lesions (SSLs) are an important colorectal cancer precursor, with the current paradigm placing emphasis on larger lesions. Guidelines advocate removal of all lesions larger than 5 mm at colonoscopy, at least in patients with serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS). SSLs with dysplasia (SSLDs) are a critical intermediary in the serrated colorectal pathway, providing insights about at-risk lesions. Diminutive ( 5 mm) SSLDs are recognized in SSLD cohorts but not well studied. However, their existence challenges the convention that diminutive SSLs warrant less attention at colonoscopy. The aim of this study was to report on the prevalence of diminutive SSLDs in a consecutive colonoscopy cohort. Methods: We performed a histopathology database search of a cohort of consecutive colonoscopies from a single operator from January 2017 to March 2022. All pathology results were reported or reviewed by a single gastrointestinal pathologist. Procedure reports where confirmed SSLDs were identified were interrogated. Polyp size was estimated at colonoscopy for diminutive lesions by comparing with a closed snare sheath, and larger lesions with the open snare. Descriptive statistics were applied. Results: Over 60 months, 3610 procedures were performed, with at least one SSL identified in 1445 procedures (46% male). There were 47 SSLDs found in 42 patients over 46 colonoscopies (57% male; median age, 69.5 years [31-89]). Multiple SSLDs were found in three patients. SSLDs ranged in size from 3 to 50 mm, with a median of 11 mm (IQR, 6-20). Ten SSLDs (21.3%) were diminutive ( 5 mm) (see examples in Fig. 1). Dysplasia was correctly identified endoscopically in 29 of 47 SSLDs (61.7%) and five of 10 diminutive lesions. SSLDs were predominantly proximally located (83% vs 17%), and 30 patients with SSLDs (71%) were found to have at least one synchronous non-dysplastic SSL. Twenty patients (47.6%) met criteria for or were suspected to have SPS. Diminutive SSLD prevalence was higher in male patients (odds ratio, 10.2; P ,"" 0.03), but colonic location, age, or association with synchronous SSLs or the presence of background SPS did not differ statistically significantly between patients with small and large SSLDs. Conclusion: A substantial proportion of dysplastic SSLs (21%) are diminutive in size and appeared to be more common in men in this cohort. These findings further support the potential significance of diminutive serrated polyps. A further large cohort study is required.""",1.0,,True

452,"Methods: We performed a retrospective audit in a metropolitan teaching hospital in Queensland that performs more than 6000 colonoscopies per year. A link to GEO, a set of culturally sensitive, patient-centered videos, was sent in a letter, an email, and SMS to patients preparing for endoscopy and colonoscopy. Previously, patients were required to attend the hospital and were given printed handouts for information. This audit obtained Provation MD data for a 6-month period in 2019, before the initiation of GEO, and a 6-month period after, in 2021. Incomplete colonoscopies or those without preparation reporting were excluded from the analysis. Statistics were performed with 2 analysis, and significance was set as a P value of < 0.05. Results: In the 6 months of 2019, before the GEO videos, a total of 2798 colonoscopies were performed. After colonoscopies with missing data and incomplete procedures were removed, there were 2031 colonoscopies for analysis. A total of 2277 colonoscopies were included in the post-GEO dataset. Results for bowel preparation and sessile serrated adenoma (SSA) detection rate before and after GEO are shown in Table 1. Conclusion: Project GEO has shown a significant reduction in poor preparation rates in a high-performing center and reduced repeat procedures, while not compromising SSA detection rate. Poor preparation often leads to abandonment of procedures, waste of health resources, and significant risk and inconvenience for patients, carers, and the system provider. Project GEO has had excellent patient feedback that it is improving patient and carer education and understanding, is improving compliance, and is convenient.
