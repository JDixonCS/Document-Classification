8,"Background: Due to their health condition, patients with neuromuscular diseases (NMD) are at greater risk of devel oping serious complications with COVID-19. The objective of this study was to analyze the prevalence of COVID-19 among NMD patients and the risk factors for its impact and severity during the first wave of the pandemic. Clinical data were collected from NMD-COVID-19 patients, between March 25, 2020 and May 11, 2020 in an anonymous sur vey carried out by expert physicians from the French Health Care Network Filnemus.",1.0,disease,True
9,"Results: Physicians reported 84 patients, including: 34 with myasthenia gravis, 27 with myopathy and 23 with neuropathy. COVID-19 had no effect on NMD for 48 (58%) patients and 48 (58%) patients developed low COVID-19 severity. COVID-19 caused the death of 9 (11%) NMD patients. Diabetic patients were at greater risk of dying. Patients with diabetes, hypertension or severe forms of NMD had a higher risk of developing a moderate or severe form of COVID-19. In our cohort, corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants were not significantly associated with higher COVID-19 severity for acquired NMD.",1.0,COVID-19,True
10,"Conclusion: During this period, a small percentage of French NMD patients was affected by COVID-19 compared to the general French population and COVID-19 had a limited short-term effect on them. Diabetes, hypertension and a severe degree of NMD were identified as risk factors of unfavorable outcome following COVID-19. Conversely, in our cohort of patients with acquired NMD, corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants did not appear to be risk factors for more severe COVID-19.",1.0,COVID-19,True

16,"Background Coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) is caused by coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It quickly struck the entire world after its first appearance in China in December 2019 and had catastrophic consequences on populations and health systems worldwide [1]. In France, public health reports on September 21, 2021 declared that 6 956 848 patients had been infected, causing 116 050 deaths [2]. Although COVID-19 has great similarities to SARS and MERS, genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has revealed that it is a novel coronavirus [3]. COVID19 leads to a wide range of clinical signs including fever, fatigue, dry cough, headache, myalgia and anosmia [4, 5]. The symptoms and severity of COVID-19 depend on the patient's age, health condition, sex and immune system [6].",1.0,Coronavirus,True
17,"In France, according to the National Data Bank of Rare Diseases (BNDMR), 50 000 patients suffer from neuromuscular diseases (NMD), a large group of rare diseases (300 forms listed to date) most often of genetic or autoimmune origin which affect both children and adults.

106,"Discussion This multicenter study showed that 84 patients with NMD followed by the French expert centers network contracted COVID-19 during the period from March 25, 2020 to May 11, 2020.

COVID-19 had no effect on 48 (58%) of them. Our study showed that the impact of COVID-19 on NMD did not depend on the category (neuropathy, myopathy and myasthenia gravis), acquired/hereditary nature of NMD or severity of NMD. Diabetic patients with NMD were at a greater risk of dying from COVID-19. In this cohort, COVID-19 severity was considered to be low in 48 (58%) NMD patients. Risk factors associated with the degree of COVID-19 severity were the severity of NMD, hypertension and diabetes.

107,"The state of health (cardio-respiratory failure, immunosuppressive medication, and other comorbidities such as diabetes or hypertension) of patients suffering from NMD has caused increased fear of COVID-19 having a devastating impact on this population. Although significant vigilance should be maintained, this fear was somewhat alleviated when we compared the data from this study with impact of COVID-19 on the general population. Indeed, on May 11, 2020, in the context of the onset of a health crisis at a time when there were few PCR tests, France reported 178 719 positive cases including 26 646 deaths, 19 572 people hospitalized in COVID-19 units and 2 712 in ICU [8]. The prevalence of COVID-19 in the population of NMD patients was therefore slightly lower than that of the French general population (0.0017 for NMD patients versus 0.0026 for the general population). The death rate in the NMD patient population was also lower than that of the French general population (0.11 vs. 0.14, respectively).

In accordance with this, a study performed on 15 myasthenia gravis patients infected with COVID19 showed that immunosuppressive therapies did not seem to cause any additional unfavorable outcome [12]. Likewise, data from myasthenic patients in our cohort showed that corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants used in the management of myasthenia gravis were not a risk factor for poorer outcomes [13]. However, studies performed on a cohort of 694 iRMD patients showed that long-term corticosteroid intake increased the risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 [10].

Nonetheless, one of major deleterious impacts of COVID-19 is that the health crisis has had huge consequences on the management of NMD patients [14-16]. Several patients have foregone or did not have access to medical care and have developed more stiffness, more pain or have reduced their walking distance.",1.0,self-isolation,True
189,"In the context of an emergency health crisis, this dynamic observatory of the number and state of health of patients has enabled Filnemus to directly monitor the evolution of this virus in patients with NMDs. Knowing the evolution and the impact of this virus on NMD patients enabled Filnemus to draw up a document intended to help resuscitators in their decision-making, in order to provide equal opportunities for the management of patients with NMD in intensive care. The data collected in this survey is essential to understand the impact of COVID-19 on this population but remains insufficient. Although our method of data collection was effective it was not exhaustive. One of the limitations of our study is the lack of confirmation of COVID-19 for several patients in our cohort due to a lack of testing at that time. Indeed, many cases with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 could not be confirmed by PCR test or Thoracic CT-scan and asymptomatic cases were not detected. Although the clinical diagnosis allowing patients to be included in the cohort is based on very specific criteria published in major scientific journals and which are highly suggestive of COVID-19, additional studies will help deepen knowledge on this subject and clarify the impact of this virus on various NMDs.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Expert centers and patient organizations made calls to 18 000 NMD patients to ensure their good health. Patients presenting COVID-19 clinical symptoms were encouraged to contact their physician. The survey was performed during the first French lockdown period that lasted from March 25, 2020 to May 11, 2020. This anonymous study was carried out in accordance with good clinical practice, General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and the local ethics committee. Patients included in this study were informed by their physician who signed informed consent notes of non-objection. All the patients in this study had NMD and were strongly suspected to be infected by SARS-CoV2. COVID-19 was confirmed either by PCR, or suspected by thoracic computed tomography (thoracic CT-Scan) [17] or symptomatology including several associated signs suggesting COVID-19: cough, fever, hyposmia, skin manifestations, myalgia, headache, diarrhea, breathlessness, chest tightness and anosmia.

The death rate was calculated as the number of NMD patients dying after SARS-CoV2 infection divided by the total number of NMD patients infected by SARS-CoV2.
