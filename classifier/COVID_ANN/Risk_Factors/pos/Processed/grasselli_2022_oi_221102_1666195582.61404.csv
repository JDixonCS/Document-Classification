26,"In Lombardy, a region in Northern Italy, the vaccination campaign started on December 27, 2020, and initially targeted health care personnel, people at least 80 years of age, and individuals with frailties (eFigure 1, eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Two vaccines based on mRNA technology (BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] and mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) and 2 vaccines using adenoviral vectors (ChADOx1-S [AstraZeneca] and Ad26.COV2 [Johnson & Johnson]) have been approved. As of February 1, 2022, 89% of Lombardy's population aged 12 years or older has been fully vaccinated, mainly with mRNA vaccines. Despite the intensive vaccination campaign, 2 pandemic waves developed in March and November 2021, and many COVID-19 patients who were critically ill, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, were admitted to one of Lombardy's COVID-19 ICUs.

46,"The moving average method for time series data was used to understand how the risk of ICU admission for COVID-19 pneumonia changed over time in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. For each day, we calculated N°ICUV as the sum of vaccinated patients admitted to an ICU within the 29-day period from 14 days before and up to 14 days after the selected day. We calculated N°POPV as the mean number of all vaccinated individuals in Lombardy within the 29-day period from 14 days before and up to 14 days after the selected day. N°ICUUnV and N°POPUnV were calculated similarly considering the number of unvaccinated patients admitted to ICU and unvaccinated individuals in Lombardy. In the moving mean calculation, we used as denominator the mean number of individuals in the 29-day window, because we assumed that it is relatively stable because the daily vaccination capacity was limited. The 29-day period was chosen as the best option among several tests (eFigure 2, 3, 4, and 5 in Supplement 1). The time course was then stratified categorizing vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals according to the type of vaccine (mRNA, AdV), time from the administration of the last vaccine dose (dichotomized as more than 120 days, less than or equal to 120 days), sex, age (dichotomized as greater than 65 years of age, less than or equal to 65 years of age), and the combination of time and type of vaccine.

Because we were interested in also considering the type of vaccine and the time elapsed since the last vaccine administration, we decided to categorize the variable vaccination status into 4 categories: (1) unvaccinated; (2) AdV vaccine with last administration less than or equal to 120 days; (3) adenovirus vaccine with last administration",1.0,negative,True

517,"All vaccines administered during the vaccination campaign in Lombardy were associated with decreased risk of developing a severe COVID-19 pneumonia leading to ICU admission, but mRNA vaccines showed more than 2 times lower risk than AdV vaccines, after adjusting for age and sex. Other studies showed an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 among vaccinated individuals of advanced age, especially those aged at least 80 years.22-25 Cerqueira-Silva et al5 compared ChADOx1-S (vaccine using adenovirus vector) to Sinovac-CoronaVac (inactivated virus), and reported an efficacy in decreasing the risk of ICU admission up to 91% with ChADOx1-S (vaccine using adenoviral vector) and 90% with Sinovac-CoronaVac (inactivated virus)5 whereas Dickerman et al4 showed higher efficacy of mRNA-1273 in preventing ICU admission compared with BNT162b2. We did not find data in the literature comparing the effectiveness of mRNA and AdV vaccines.

Furthermore, mRNA vaccines maintained a greater and more prolonged effectiveness in preventing ICU admission compared with AdV.",1.0,vaccine,True
519,"During the vaccination campaign, Lombardy experienced 2 pandemic waves. The first wave (early 2021) was characterized by Alpha variant predominance and a low prevalence of vaccinated citizens (less than 1 [parts per thousand] of patients admitted to ICU were vaccinated). During the summer of 2021, the Delta variant appeared and quickly became predominant while about 50% of the Lombardy population had been fully vaccinated. Consequently, the percentage of vaccinated patients admitted to ICU progressively increased, ranging from 30% to 40%. The demographics and baseline health status of ICU patients with COVID-19 pneumonia varied dramatically according to the vaccination status. Unvaccinated patients were 12 years younger than vaccinated patients, had fewer comorbidities and a lower prevalence of immunosuppressive therapy at baseline but showed a more severe acute respiratory failure at ICU admission. Among vaccinated patients, the mRNA group had more comorbidities, likely due to the criteria for vaccination eligibility specified by the Italian campaign (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).",1.0,pandemic,True
520,"Despite these important differences, we did not observe a substantial difference in ICU and hospital length of stay and in ICU mortality between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. At variance, hospital mortality was higher in the mRNA vaccine group, possibly due to the older age and higher number of comorbidities. Indeed, accounting for all statistically significant confounders, we did not find an association between hospital mortality and vaccination status.",1.0,vaccine,True
521,"Available data describing ICU mortality is very heterogenous due to differences in patient demographics, baseline health status, and need for respiratory support.

Evidence suggests that heterologous vaccination regimens mixing AdV and mRNA vaccines elicits an enhanced quality of the B- and T-cell responses.31 Unfortunately, the low number of individuals available in this cohort prevented the assessment of the impact of heterologous vaccination on ICU admission and outcome. Given the broad usage worldwide of mixed heterologous vaccination regiments32 it will be important to assess their association with ICU admission and outcome.",1.0,vaccine,True

Fourth, the data set used for the analysis did not provide clinically relevant information such as superinfections, medical and pharmaceutical interventions, or the cause of death.

Among patients admitted to an ICU for COVID-19 pneumonia, vaccinated patients were older and had more comorbidities compared with unvaccinated patients.
