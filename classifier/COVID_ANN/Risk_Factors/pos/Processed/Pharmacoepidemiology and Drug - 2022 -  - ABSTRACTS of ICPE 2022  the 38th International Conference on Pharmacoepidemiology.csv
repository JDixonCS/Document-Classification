7,"Background: Pharmacoepidemiology studies often have missing data that are nonmonotone (i.e., data missing in an arbitrary pattern). It is well known that complete case analysis (CC) reduces precision and may result in bias. Previously, inverse probability weighting (IPW) for nonmonotone missingness could not be easily implemented in standard software, but a new approach for estimating the missingness weights (unconstrained maximum likelihood estimator, UMLE) overcomes this difficulty. Objectives: To compare performance of IPW by UMLE and multiple imputation (MI) to address nonmonotone missingness when estimating the average treatment effect. Methods: We conducted a simulation study. We simulated 2000 datasets with a binary treatment, a binary outcome, and three confounders. The outcome risk was 0.1 in the untreated. We varied sample size (1500, 5000), percent treated (15%, 50%), and the true marginal risk difference (0, 0.05). We simulated missing data (missing at random) yielding 50% complete cases. We implemented four analyzes in each dataset: analysis of the full data (without missingness), CC, IPW by UMLE, and MI by chained equations. In each analysis, we used inverse probability of treatment weights to address confounding and estimated the risk difference by weighted linear-binomial model with robust standard errors. In IPW by UMLE, the propensity score model (used to estimate the treatment weights) was weighted by the missingness weights; the final weight was the product of the two weights. In MI, results from 20 imputed datasets were combined by Rubin's rule. Results: When the true risk difference was 0.05, CC was biased in each scenario (bias > 0.02). MI had negligible bias (<0.002). IPW also had negligible bias; however, bias increased slightly at the smaller N , 1500 with 15% exposed (0.005). At N ,"" 5000, 50% exposed,""",1.0,epidemiology,True
8,"analysis of the full data yielded an empirical standard error (SE) of 0.010. IPW and MI were equally less precise (SE 0.015). As sample size and percent exposed declined, SE for analysis of the full data increased to 0.027 and MI became slightly more precise than IPW (MI SE 0.046 vs. IPW SE 0.048). MI implementation was >13 times slower than IPW in SAS. Results were similar across estimators when the true risk difference was zero. Conclusions: IPW UMLE performed well and was easy to implement in SAS and R. Though less statistically efficient at smaller sample sizes, IPW is a viable alternative to MI for nonmonotone missingness. IPW may be more intuitive for researchers already familiar with weighting and faster computational efficiency of IPW is attractive in large datasets or when bootstrap is required.",1.0,,True

11,"Background: Determining prescription duration is a first step in most studies with information on drug exposure obtained from Pharmacoepidemiologic databases. In statistical process theory, it is well known that the sampling frame may bias estimates of the inter-arrival distribution (IAD) governing the gap time from event to event. These effects have received limited attention in Pharmacoepidemiology, where prescription duration is often estimated from the distribution of gap times between dispensing's. Including all gap times, individuals with shorter gap times will contribute relatively more observations (downward bias), and longer observation windows will include more individuals with a treatment stop (upward bias). The Waiting Time Distribution (WTD) is a validated procedure for estimation of prescription duration and thus used for reference. Objectives: To estimate the bias when using individuals observed gap times between dispensing's to estimate prescription durations.",1.0,epidemiology,True

19,"Methods: We obtained information on prescription redemptions of warfarin in 2013-2014 at pharmacies in southern Denmark (1.2 million inhabitants) captured in Odense Pharmacoepidemiological Database (OPED). In the first approach, we sampled all gap times ignoring censored gap times. Secondly, we included censored gap times. Finally, we sampled one, possibly censored, gap time for each individual. All approaches were applied to a one year period (2013) and a two year period (2013 and 2014). For each approach, we estimated the median and 90th percentile of the sampled distribution. Reference percentiles were estimated with the reverse WTD using one random index date per individual sampled in 2014 and a 1 year observation period before the index date. The reverse WTD used a lognormal recurrence distribution. Results: The reverse WTD estimated a median of 60.6 (95% CI: 59.1; 62.1) days and a 90th percentile of 116.2 (114.1; 118.4) days. When all uncensored gap times observed in a 1 year period were used, the median was 55 (54; 55) days and the 90th percentile 103 (103; 104) days. Using a 2 years period, estimates increased to 56 and 111 days. Including censored gap times, the median and 90th percentile was estimated at 59 and 134 days (1 year period) and 60 and 135 days (2 years period). When one random, possibly censored, gap time was used for each patient, only the median at 74 days could be estimated with a one year period; with a 2 year period the estimates were 63 (4.0% relative bias) and 127 days (9.3% relative bias). Conclusions: Using all gap times induced downward bias, whereas using only a single random gap time per patient caused upward bias. The length of the observation period affected bias magnitude.

22,"Background: Parametric assumptions have the potential to reduce the variance of effect estimates, but making such assumptions comes with the cost of the potential for bias. Though the bias/variance tradeoff is well described in many settings, it has not been well characterized for the causal analysis of time-to-event outcomes. Objectives: To evaluate how parametric assumptions affect the bias and variance of causal estimation of time-to-event outcomes. Methods: We conducted a simulation study to explore how nonparametric and semi-parametric estimators perform when estimating a causal cumulative risk difference. The simulated data included a binary treatment and Weibull-distributed censoring and potential outcome times. Two settings were assessed, one in which the hazard ratio was constant across time (proportional hazards) and one in which it was not (non-proportional hazards). The bias, variance, and mean squared error (MSE) of the risk difference estimates were then assessed for each estimator.",1.0,,True
23,"Results: In the proportional hazards scenario, the MSE of the semiparametric estimator was at least 50% lower compared to nonparametric estimator across most scenarios. With a sample size of 1000, the semi-parametric estimator had a 95% lower MSE compared to non-parametric models. However, when the data did not have proportional hazards, the MSE of the semi-parametric estimator was at least twice that of the non-parametric model and went as high as 9.5 times the MSE for with a sample size of 1000. Conclusions: When hazards are proportional, making parametric assumptions nearly halved the MSE compared to a non-parametric estimate, but almost doubled the MSE when the parametric assumptions were not valid. Thus, the causal cumulative risk difference is sensitive to model misspecification and assuming any semi-parametric model on the data should be conducted cautiously when a causal interpretation of cumulative risk is desired.",1.0,,True

26,"Background: Statins have shown antineoplastic activity in pre-clinical studies, and several studies with long-term follow-up have shown a small risk-reducing impact of statins on breast cancer (BrCa) risk. However, these studies may be biased by healthy adherer effects and did not address how differential use of screening mammography during follow-up might affect BrCa incidence. Objectives: We sought to evaluate whether initial statin persistence was associated with (1) screening mammography and (2) risk of incident BrCa accounting for any differential screening behavior in a contemporary Danish statin initiator cohort. Methods: We identified female statin initiators aged 50-69 in Denmark between 2001 and 2018 with no history of BrCa, and classified women according to their statin persistence in the first 6 months after initiation. We estimated age- and calendar time-standardized mammography coverage (i.e., proportion screened) by persistence. We then estimated BrCa risk controlling for baseline confounding using inverse-probability-of-treatment weights (IPTW) and using inverse-probability-of-screening weights (IPSW) to account for differential detection. For the IPSW, we estimated a screening propensity score in each interval based on screening predictors in the prior interval; these included persistence, prior screening, and family history of breast cancer, other screening tests (e.g., bone mineral density scans), comorbidities, and comedications. The inverse of this score served as the denominator of the IPSW, which was stabilized by the marginal screening frequency. The cumulative product of all prior intervals IPSW was used to account for longitudinal screening behavior.",1.0,clinical,True

30,"Results: A total of 267 390 women met study inclusion criteria, and 81.1% of the cohort was persistent. Persistent women had 5.7 percentage points higher screening coverage over follow-up (52.2% vs. 46.5%). Statin persistence and prior screening were associated with higher probability of subsequent screening, while hospitalizations and smoking- or alcohol-related diagnoses were negatively associated. IPSW largely removed these differences. In crude analysis, the 15-year risk of BrCa was 0.05; persistent women had a 15-year BrCa risk difference (RD) of 0.002 (95% confidence interval [CI]: À0.001, 0.005). The RD was À0.003 (95% CI: À0.014, 0.008) after implementing IPTW/IPSW. Conclusions: Statin persistent women had higher screening coverage, leading to a slightly higher observed BrCa risk in crude analysis; accounting for differential screening produced a negative observed RD, in line with the hypothesized healthy adherer bias, though all estimates remained nonsignificant.

31,"present. Yet, when data are sparse at low-dose ranges, the spike-andspline approach may not have appropriate degrees of freedom to provide meaningful insights into the dose-response association. Our proposed slab-and-spline approach provides efficiency gains in this setting. When spike or slab terms are not included, the dose-response curve is forced through the origin, creating a sense of a range of safe doses where none exists. Of note, spline approaches capture the dose-response association at higher doses, irrespective of inclusion of spike or slab terms. Conclusions: The spike/slab-and-spline approaches provide advantages over traditional approaches in elucidating dose-response associations between continuous exposures and outcomes with markedly less bias, particularly at lower dose ranges. Given the relative ease of implementing these approaches, along with the very low cost in power, we recommend inclusion of these terms to better capture full dose-response relationships in Pharmacoepidemiologic drug exposure studies.",1.0,curve,True

34,"Background: Determining the dose-response association between continuously measured drug exposures and outcomes can help substantiate observations in Pharmacoepidemiologic research. Traditionally employed approaches for modeling continuous dose exposures (e.g., natural cubic splines) presume the effect of continuous exposure to continuously shrink toward zero with smaller doses, potentially creating a false sense of safety when caution would be warranted. Objectives: To develop analytic approaches to accommodate the relative effect of any dose exposure (e.g., through a nocebo-like effect), and to compare these methods to other commonly implemented models. Methods: We propose a semi-continuous ""spike-and-spline"" approach to accommodate exposure distributions characterized by a ""spike"" at zero followed by a continuous dose range. Furthermore, we extended this method and introduced a ""slab-and-spline"" approach that can be used when there are sparse data available at low doses. We conducted a comprehensive range of simulations with semicontinuous exposures and continuous outcomes to evaluate the operating characteristics of each approach including bias, coverage, and power when the spike effect was and was not present. Specific comparator methods included linear regression modeling and analyzes of users only (i.e., those with a positive dose). Results: Simulations reveal the spike-and-spline approach to provide substantive reductions in bias and improved coverage compared to traditional approaches when a there are effects at low doses present, with comparatively small costs in power when the effect is not",1.0,positive,True

44,"Background: There is some biological evidence suggesting that incretin-based drugs used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes may have beneficial effects in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and reduce the risk of exacerbations. To date, however, real-world evidence for this potentially beneficial effect is limited. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine whether the use of incretin-based drugs is associated with a decreased risk of COPD exacerbations among patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: Using the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked with the Hospital Episode Statistics database, we assembled two separate active comparator new-user cohorts of patients with COPD who developed type 2 diabetes (2007-2019). The first cohort included 1252 initiators of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and 14 259 initiators of sulfonylureas, while the second cohort included 8731 initiators of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and 18 204 initiators of sulfonylureas. Cox proportional hazards models with propensity score fine stratification weighting were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of severe COPD exacerbation (defined as hospital admission for COPD), separately for GLP-1 RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors. We also assessed whether these drugs were associated with a decreased risk of moderate exacerbations (defined as a co-prescription of an oral corticosteroid and an antibiotic along with an outpatient diagnosis of acute COPD exacerbation).

Conclusions: In this population-based study, the use of GLP-1 RAs was associated with a reduced risk of severe and moderate exacerbations when compared with the use of sulfonylureas in patients with COPD and type two diabetes.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the largest multiinstitutional electronic medical records database in Taiwan, containing 6% of the Taiwanese population, that is, 1.3 million patients. We included T2D patients newly prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) from 2016 to 2018. Our primary outcome was incident glaucoma diagnosis between initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs, and 31 March 2021. After applying inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to increase homogeneity of co-morbidities, co-medications, glycemic controls and renal functions between the two treatment groups at baseline, we estimated hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the risk of glaucoma, based on Cox proportional hazards regression models. To demonstrate the robustness of our study results, we conducted several sensitivity analyzes by using other propensity score methods (1:1 matching and standardized mortality ratio weighting methods) and on-treatment analysis.

Methods: We implemented an active comparator, new user cohort study design using commercially insured (MarketScan 2007-2019, age 18-65) and older adult (Medicare fee-for-service 2007-2017, 20% random sample, age 65+) patients. We identified patients aged 18+, who initiated GLP1RA versus sulfonylurea (SU) with asthma at baseline. The outcome was incident asthma exacerbation, defined by hospital admission or emergency room (ER) visit with asthma codes in the first position. Follow-up started at the second prescription within 180 days after initiation ignoring treatment changes. We applied iCF, a causal forest-based algorithm we developed for subgroup identification, to identify heterogeneous subgroup-specific conditional average treatment effects. In each subgroup, we estimated propensity scores to balance age, comorbidities, medications, and other potential confounders, and then estimated adjusted risk difference (aRD) by inverse probability treatment weight. Results: We identified 17 520 patients initiating GLP1RA or SU. The aRD was À1.4% (À2.0% to À0.9%) (Crude risk 1.9% vs. 3.8%) and À1.1% (À2.9% to 0.8%) (Crude risk 3.7% vs. 5.6%) in MarketScan (8047 vs. 3082) and Medicare (682 vs. 5929), respectively.

However, real-world evidence for this possible effect is lacking. Objectives: To determine whether the use of GLP-1 RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors, separately, is associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer among patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: We assembled two new-user, active comparator cohorts of patients with type 2 diabetes using the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink (2007 to 2019). The first cohort included 5063 initiators of GLP-1 RAs and 112 955 initiators of sulfonylureas, while the second cohort included 53 529 initiators of DPP-4 inhibitors and 114 417 initiators of sulfonylureas. Patients were considered exposed from the date of the first prescription until the end of the follow-up period, regardless of treatment discontinuation or crossover to one of the other study drugs. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of incident prostate cancer, separately for GLP-1 RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors. The models were weighted using propensity score fine stratification. Results: In the first cohort, GLP-1 RAs were associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer when compared with sulfonylureas (incidence rates: 156.4 vs. 232.0 per 100 000 person-years, respectively; HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.43-0.99) after a median follow-up of 5.0 years.

Objectives: To investigate the association between use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and risk of serious liver events in routine clinical practice. Methods: We conducted a cohort study using data from nationwide registers in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, 2013-2018. Patients aged 35-84 who were newly prescribed a GLP-1 receptor agonist or an active comparator, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor, were included. The primary outcome was serious liver events; a composite of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and death from hepatic causes. Secondary outcomes were the individual components of the primary outcome. In intention-to-treat analyzes, Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs), using standardized mortality ratio weighting based on a propensity score to control for confounding. Results: The cohort included 68 510 new users of GLP-1 receptor agonists and 222 906 new users of DPP4 inhibitors. Mean age of the study population was 62 years and 41% were female.

Observational studies have shown that both exposure to SSRIs during pregnancy and antenatal maternal depression are associated with preterm birth (PTB), making it difficult to disentangle the effects of the condition and the treatment. Objectives: We aimed to estimate the effects of SSRIs and maternal depression on the risk of PTB, using data from electronic health records (EHR) across two independent health systems. Methods: We used primary care EHR from IMRD-UK (incorporating data from THIN, a Cegedim database) and validation EHR from UCSF in the US. The cohorts included 216 070 deliveries of 176 866 patients from 1996 to 2018 at IMRD-UK, and 10 284 deliveries from 20132016 at UCSF.

121,"Background: The Faurot frailty index is a validated algorithm using demographic, enrollment, and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)-based billing information in Medicare claims data as a proxy for frailty. This algorithm has been shown to predict geriatric-relevant outcomes. In October 2015, the US healthcare system transitioned from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Objectives: To update the Faurot frailty index for the ICD-10-CM era and assess the validity of the updated index after the transition. Methods: We used a random sample of Medicare fee-for-service claims and enrollment data from 2013-2017. Applying General Equivalence Mappings (GEMs) and a forward-backward approach, we translated the code lists for diagnosis-based frailty indicators (e.g., arthritis, dementia) from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM and subsequently manually reviewed code lists. We plotted monthly period prevalence of each frailty indicator and the distribution of the claims-based predicted probability of frailty before and after the ICD transition. To evaluate the association between the updated Faurot frailty index and 1-year risk of key geriatric outcomes (mortality, hospitalization, skilled nursing facility admission), we identified beneficiaries enrolled on Jan 1, 2017 who were continuously enrolled during an 8-month lookback (May-Dec 2016). We assessed frailty indicators and predicted probability of frailty during the lookback, started outcome follow-up on Jan 1, 2017, and estimated 1-year risks for each outcome.",1.0,Disease,True
122,"Results: Updated indicators based on GEMs had similar prevalence compared to pre-transition indicator definitions. The exception was rehabilitation services, for which we added Current Procedural Terminology procedure codes to the algorithm to improve capture. The median and interquartile range (IQR) for predicted probability of frailty were similar before and after the ICD transition (pre-transition median [IQR]: 0.034 [0.02-0.07]; post-transition: 0.038 [0.02-0.09]). Using the updated Faurot frailty index, predicted probability of frailty (categorized as <0.05, 0.05  0.1, 0.1  0.2, 0.2  0.4, 0.4) was positively associated with 1-year mortality risk (1.7%, 5.3%, 10.2%, 17.8%, 31.2%). Higher predicted probability of frailty was also associated with increased 1-year risk of hospitalization and skilled nursing facility admission. These associations were similar to those during the ICD-9-CM era. Conclusions: We updated the Faurot frailty index for the ICD-10-CM era and confirmed its associations with key geriatric-relevant outcomes.

We used linear mixed models to estimate associations between smoking (separately for (1) pack-years and (2) tobacco use including intensity) and frailty, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, time-updated CD4 count, baseline frailty score, site, and years from baseline. We scaled the effects (point estimates and 95% confidence intervals) of smoking relative to the impact of age on frailty to improve interpretability. Results: Mean follow-up of PWH was 5.2 years (median: 4.7 years). The mean age at baseline was 45 (IQR: 36-53) years, 14% of the cohort was female, 30% were Black, and 48% were white. Sixty percent reported former (28%) or current (32%) smoking at baseline and a mean of 9 pack-years for those who ever smoked. In adjusted analyzes, all measures of smoking were significantly associated with higher frailty scores. The effect per 5 additional pack-years smoking on frailty score was comparable to 18 additional years of age (95% CI: 8-27 years). Similarly, the frailty score for those reporting former smoking was comparable to 24 additional years of age (95% CI: 5- 43 years), whereas current smoking was comparable to 39 additional years (95% CI: 18-61 years) and 10 additional cigarettes per day was comparable to 19 additional years of age (95% CI: 2-36 years).

165,"Background: Treatment effects derived from randomized controlled trials may not be generalizable to real-world populations that have different distributions of effect modifiers. Predicting effects for a target population in clinical practice can provide useful insights into the expected benefits and risks, especially shortly after a drug's launch when observational data are scarce. Objectives: We developed outcome prediction models leveraging individual-level trial data and used these models to predict treatment effects in a real-world US Medicare population. Methods: We used data from the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy trial, which investigated the effect of dabigatran vs warfarin on the occurrence of stroke or systemic embolism (stroke/se) among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Outcome prediction models were developed within each treatment group by fitting Weibull parametric survival models in the trial data and were validated using bootstrapping. The target population was defined as Medicare fee-for-service enrollees with AF who initiated dabigatran or warfarin between 2011 and 2017. We predicted rates, rate differences (RD), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of stroke/se, cardiovascular death, major bleeding, gastrointestinal (GI) major bleeding, and minor bleeding based on the distribution of measured characteristics of the target population. Results: Model calibration was good, and discrimination was adequate, for example, optimism corrected Harrell's C-index of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.61-0.71) for dabigatran and 0.64 (0.62-0.70) for warfarin for stroke/se.

The predicted RDs for major bleeding (À2.2 [À7.1, 2.8]; 1.6 [0.8, 2.4]), GI major bleeding (5.3 [2.3, 8.3]; 7.5 [7.0, 8.0]), and minor bleeding (À21.6 [À34.5, À8.8]; 6.1 [4.3, 7.9]) suggested more bleeding harms in the target population. Conclusions: The predicted effect estimates suggested that, compared with warfarin, the expected benefits of dabigatran would be similar in terms of reducing stroke/se or cardiovascular death, but risks of bleeding would be greater in the target Medicare population compared with the effects in the trial population.",1.0,trial,True

169,"Background: Pharmacoepidemiologic research generalizing or transporting effect estimates from a study to a target population often suggests conditioning on all effect measure modifiers (EMM) on the scale of interest. EMM is known to be scale dependent, but there is also a rich literature on the nuances of EMM and collapsibility that is often neglected when considering external validity. More specific characterization of EMM and the mathematical nuances of effect measures like the risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) is needed. Objectives: To describe how the scale of an effect measure (i.e. RD vs RR) alters the types of covariates that must be balanced to generalize or transport internally valid effect estimates to an external target. Methods: We defined two types of EMM: marginal EMM, where a (unconfounded) effect on the scale of interest differs across levels of a variable; and conditional EMM, where an effect differs across levels of a variable conditional on a set of other variables. These EMM types define three variable classes: Class 1 (conditional and marginal EMM), Class 2 (marginal, but not conditional EMM), and Class 3 (neither marginal nor conditional EMM, still associated with the outcome). We created a study and target population of 1000 individuals with two options for a treatment X, a binary outcome Y, and a binary covariate in Class 1 (M), Class 2 (N), and Class 3 (O) on a linear (when examining the RD) or log-linear (when examining the RR) scale. Each population had different probabilities of M (0.5 in the trial, 0.2 in the target), probabilities of N given M (0.7 if M ,"" 1, 0.3 if M "", 0 vs. 0.3 if M ,"" 1, 0.7 if M "","" 0), and O (0.3 vs. 0.6).

176,"Background: Genital herpes infection (GHI), especially asymptomatic GHI, is likely an overlooked risk factor for preterm delivery (PTD). Women with GHI, even without symptoms, continue to shed the virus during pregnancy and have been shown to be at a higher risk of PTD. Effective medications for treating GHI exist. Treating women with GHI during pregnancy could potentially lead to reduction in PTD risk. Objectives: To determine whether treating women with GHI during pregnancy reduces the risk of PTD. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in 89 132 pregnant Kaiser Permanente Northern California members. Four cohorts were established based on the combination of GHI and its treatment status: women with clinically diagnosed GHI that was not treated during pregnancy (untreated); women with GHI treated with medications before the third trimester; women with GHI treated only during the third trimester, and women with neither GHI nor any treatment. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the risk of PTD associated with GHI and its treatment, while accounting for different gestational ages at delivery, timing of initial treatment, and potential confounders. Sensitivity analysis using propensity score methodology was also conducted. Results: Women with untreated GHI were at increased risk of PTD (almost 80% higher) compared to women without GHI (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.79; 95% CI, and 1.57-2.04). Treating GHI during pregnancy was associated with a 27% reduced risk of PTD, compared with untreated GHI (aHR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60-0.88). The treatment was most effective for medication use 20 days, with an almost 50% reduction in PTD (aHR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.40-0.66).

Sensitivity analyzes using PS methodology confirmed that the estimates for PTD were consistent and robust. Conclusions: This study adds new evidence that women with GHI, if untreated, are at higher risk of PTD. More importantly, treating such women with currently available medications during pregnancy is effective in reducing the risk of PTD, especially when taking medications for over 20 days, and starting treatment before the third trimester. This new knowledge could give rationale for prenatal screening for GHI and proactive treatment of GHI to reduce PTD.",1.0,,True

Outcomes were the infants' filled antimicrobial prescriptions, infections diagnosed in specialist care and deaths with infections indicated as underlying or contributing causes (""infection-related deaths""). Birth year, birth season, maternal age, place of residence, parity, co-morbidities, body mass index, general health status, education level, and smoking were considered as covariates. Poisson regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the number of antimicrobial prescriptions filled for the infant.

We estimated absolute risks, and relative risks (RR) with 95% CIs using a generalized linear model. A propensity score (PS) was estimated based on demographics, indications, obstetrical/comorbid conditions, other medications, and healthcare utilization markers assessed from 90 days before pregnancy start until the index date. Exposure groups were matched 1:1 based on the index date ±14 days and the PS using a caliper of 0.05. In sensitivity analyzes, we required 2 fills to define exposure.

Results: We identified 1115 atenolol and 9311 methyldopa initiators. The absolute risk of IUGR/SGA was 5.1% in the atenolol group and 4.2% in the methyldopa group, corresponding to a crude RR of 1.22 (95% CI: 0.93-1.60).

210,"Objectives: To evaluate and apply the proposed methods in two selfcontrolled case series (SCCS): (1) thiazolidinediones and fracture risk using sulphonylureas as a comparator to address potential residual time-varying confounding by age, and (2) fluoroquinolones (FQ) and uveitis using cephalosporin as a comparator to address potential timevarying confounding by indication. Methods: We used data from two CPRD studies. We fitted conditional Poisson regression models deriving incidence rate ratios (IRRs) using risk periods of 1-28 days for thiazolidinediones, and 1-29, 30- 59 days and > ,"" 60 until end of treatment for fluoroquinolones. The models were adjusted for age, and additionally for calendar time for uveitis. We adapted the parameterization of the model of Hallas et al. to Wilkinson and Rogers' (1973) framework for factorial models for the analysis of variance, identifying nested model terms, and extended this to non-binary exposure variables. We then used the IRR regression coefficients from these models to obtain a ratio of ratios, and its confidence interval, using Wald methods (the simple ratio method). We also fitted a single nested regression model in each SCCS to derive the same estimand (the regression method). Results: We included 1095 individuals from the fracture case series, and 9639 from the uveitis case series. Use of thiazolidinediones was not strongly associated with an increased risk of fracture (adjusted IRR (aIRR) "","" 1.50, 95%CI "","" 0.74-1.58). Incorporating sulphonylureas as an active comparator led to aIRRs of 2.14 (1.37-3.33) using the simple ratio method and 1.88 (1.23-2.87) using the regression method, with the difference between the two methods due to age adjustment. The aIRR for each time-period after fluoroquinolone exposure and uveitis was 1.17 (0.90-1.52), 1.20 (0.93-1.55) and 0.89 (0.52-1.52). Incorporating cephalosporin as a comparator reduced the aIRRs slightly to 0.96 (0.69-1.34), 1.18 (0.84-1.65), 0.83 (0.43-1.60) using the simple ratio method and 0.96 (0.69-1.34), 1.18 (0.84-1.66) and 0.85 (0.44-1.63) using the regression method. Conclusions: We have clarified recently proposed methods using active comparators in self-controlled studies by expressing this in standard factorial-model notation, and demonstrated how it can be applied to SCCS with multiple risk periods. Our findings illustrate that active comparators, representing a comparable standard of care for the population of interest, can be a valuable tool for controlling unmeasured time-varying confounding in SCCS.""",1.0,case,True

217,"areas raises questions about unmeasured adherence mechanisms among users of these injectable therapies versus oral small-molecule drugs, which are typically less costly, dosed at more frequent intervals, and unlikely to require administration by a medical professional. Negative control outcomes (NCOs) can be used to detect residual bias when differential adherence is suspected. Objectives: We used NCOs to assess the comparability of women receiving biannual denosumab injections to those receiving onceweekly oral alendronate for postmenopausal osteoporosis (OP). To gage the impact of differential adherence, we compared results from an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis to an analysis that censored for treatment discontinuation. Methods: We identified women aged 55 years in the 2010-2019 de-identified Optum© Clinformatics® Data Mart Database who switched to denosumab (N , 11 832) or alendronate (N ,"" 8658) after receiving another antiresportive in the prior 455 days. We assessed the potential for residual bias when comparing denosumab and alendronate by estimating 12-month cumulative risk differences (RDs) for 12 NCOs. RDs were estimated using a doubly robust augmented inverse-probability of treatment and censoring weighted estimator, with treatment discontinuation defined as a 30-day gap. Results: For all NCOs, women initiating weekly oral alendronate were more likely to discontinue treatment (range: 50-59%) compared to those initiating biannual denosumab injections (range: 20-28%). In ITT analyzes, the risk among denosumab users was elevated for over half of the NCOs compared to alendronate users, suggesting residual bias. When censoring for treatment discontinuation, the risk of NCOs was similar between the denosumab and alendronate groups, consistent with the hypothesis that these groups are comparable dependent on measured covariates. For example, the RD (95% confidence interval) for having received an annual wellness exam was 3% (1%, 4%) in the ITT analysis versus 1% (À1%, 3%) in the analysis that censored for treatment discontinuation. Conclusions: Our findings highlight that adherence to an OP biologic versus a small-molecule drug may be highly differential. Interestingly, our NCO analyzes suggest that residual bias may nonetheless be negligible when censoring for treatment discontinuation, presumably because removing the high proportion of patients who discontinue oral alendronate renders that group more comparable to injectable denosumab users with respect to health-seeking behaviors and other unmeasured mechanisms of adherence.""",1.0,area,True

221,"their use is often hampered by unmeasured confounding. In recent years, it has been hypothesized that part of this unmeasured confounding could be recovered by an automated screening of a vast number of covariates in these databases; extension of causal inference methods have been proposed, such as the high-dimensional propensity score (HDPS), the G-computation (GC), and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) but studies comparing their performance on medico-administrative databases are lacking. Objectives: The main objective of this work was to compare the performance of these methods in terms of bias reduction using an empirical study concerning the potential risks of prematurity of drug exposure during pregnancy. Methods: We used an extraction from the French National Health Data System (SNDS) from January 2012 to December 2014, which contains socio-demographic information, medication uses, and comorbidities of nearly 2.7 million deliveries. For each delivery, three trimesters (13-week periods) were considered: the trimester before the start of pregnancy (T0), the first trimester (T1), and the trimester before the delivery (TBD). A delivery was considered exposed to a drug during a given trimester if at least one dispensation of that drug had been recorded during that trimester. Three causal inference methods were considered: (i) HDPS with LASSO regression for covariates selection, (ii) GC with LASSO regression as outcome model, and (iii) TMLE. For HDPS, the scores were incorporated through weighting (overlap weights (OW) and matching weights (MW)) or regression adjustment. These methods were also compared to a reference model, which includes socio-demographical covariates and drug exposures of interest during previous trimesters. The methods were firstly compared in terms of average bias on a reference set of 42 negative control drugs pertaining to preterm birth. Furthermore, 13 positive control medications were used to test the ability of the methods to reject correctly false null hypotheses. Results: Overall, our results show that the average bias of all methods were lower than that of the reference model. Moreover, bias tended to be close between HDPS and GC and higher with TMLE. Regarding HDPS implementations, the average bias of OW and MW were similar and lower than that of regression adjustment. As for the positive controls, the number of significant associations found by HDPS and GC was 6 (45%) and 9 for TMLE (70%). Conclusions: Our results confirm the interest of these methods in accounting for a part of the unmeasured confounding. They also indicate more comparable performance between HDPS and GC than with TMLE.",1.0,negative,True

227,"Background: The prevalent new user (PNU) design allows researchers to answer research questions that cannot be addressed via an active comparator new user design (e.g. effects of switching or augmenting vs continuing on treatment). While time-conditional propensity score (TCPS) matching was the initial analytic strategy used for PNU studies, other strategies may be capable of addressing confounding in PNU cohorts but have not been assessed for bias and efficiency. Objectives: To evaluate relative bias of the risk ratio (RR) estimates from various analytic approaches in a simulated PNU cohort. Methods: We simulated a population the size of the original PNU study (86 000 total new users of the treatment of interest and comparator), with 4900 of the comparator new users becoming PNUs. Individuals initiated the comparator with the option to stop, restart, or switch to the treatment of interest over time, with probabilities of each determined by four confounders; the outcome was binary and ended followup (similar to a mortality outcome). We evaluated standardized morbidity ratio weighting (SMRW), disease risk scores (DRS), TCPS matching with replacement (TCPS-R), TCPS matching without replacement that matched participants in ascending (TCPS-Ascending) or descending (TCPS-Descending) order of time on treatment, PS matching to a comparator sample created without replacement in ascending (MatchAscending) or descending (Match-Descending) order of time on treatment, and PS matching when randomly selecting one comparator observation per continuing individual (Match-Random) as analytic options. We compared average three-year RRs from each analytic method across 2000 replicates to the truth (estimated with a Monte Carlo approach) for both a null effect and a protective effect. Results: When estimating a null effect, SMRW, DRS, TCPS-R, TCPSAscending, and Match-Ascending were all unbiased. TCPSDescending (RR ,"" 0.983), Match-Descending (0.903), and MatchRandom (0.802) exhibited progressively more bias, despite balanced covariate distributions. Similar patterns in bias were present when the treatment of interest was protective vs. the comparator. SMRW and DRS were the most precise methods. Conclusions: Multiple analytic methods can estimate effects without bias in PNU cohorts including SMRW and DRS. If matching without replacement is used (whether in TCPS or other matching strategies) matching in ascending order of time on treatment helps prevent selection bias. Analytic approaches in empirical applications of PNU designs should be unbiased and balance computational complexity, practicality, and interpretability.""",1.0,disease,True

Objectives: To investigate this association using a conventional selfcontrolled case series (SCCS) and SCCS with an active comparator (H2 receptor antagonists, H2RA) to address confounding and protopathic bias. Methods: We conducted a SCCS using data from the Clinical Data Analysis and Report System in Hong Kong. Adult with 1 outpatient oral PPI prescription or H2RA and first recorded MI as the principal diagnosis in either an inpatient setting or a visit to an A&E department from 2003-2014 were included. A random subset of H2RA user was included as an active comparator because H2RAs have no hypothesized causal association with MI. The rates of MI during risk periods were compared to the baseline to estimate the age adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) using conditional Poisson regression. We used both simple ratio and effect modifier approaches to SCCS with an active comparator to obtain comparator-adjusted estimates. Results: A total of 2802 and 1889 people with MI who had exposure to PPIs and H2RA were included respectively. We observed a higher risk of MI during days 1-14 following the start of PPI prescription (IRR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.76-3.00) but this did not persist during days 15-30 (IRR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.90-1.81) and during days 31-60 (IRR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.95- 1.64) versus baseline. Similarly, we observed a higher risk of MI during days 1-14 following the start of H2RA prescription (IRR: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.92-3.16) but this also did not persist to days 15-30 (IRR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.72-1.48) and days 31-60 (IRR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.04-1.70) versus baseline.

Conclusions: We observed no difference in risk of MI associated with PPIs compared with baseline using H2RA as the active comparator. The elevated risk of MI associated with PPIs is likely due to protopathic bias.

As proposed, the PNUD conflates two separate causal questions. Objectives: We examined the impact of excluding new-users of a drug of interest who have no prior use of the comparator from the cohort of prevalent new-users. Methods: Using MarketScan claims data (2005-2014), we compared the risk of heart failure between patients initiating GLP-1 analogs and patients initiating or continuing sulfonylureas (SU). Baseline comorbidities and medication use were assessed using an all-available lookback with a 365-day minimum. Continuous use and switching were defined using a 30-day grace period beyond the prescription's day supply. We considered two populations of interest: (1) ""GLP-1 New + Switch"" combined new users of GLP-1 (no prior SU, all-available lookback) with patients switching from SU to GLP-1, and (2) ""GLP-1 Switch"" consisted only of patients switching from SU to GLP-1. For both populations, we used two separate methods to identify comparator cohorts and control for baseline confounding. First, using time-conditional propensity scores (TCPS) and prescription-based exposure sets we matched (1:1, with replacement) GLP-1 users to SU users. Second, using time-stratified standardized morbidity ratio weighting (SMRW). Cox-proportional hazard models estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI of hospitalized heart failure. Results: We identified 76 179 GLP-1 patients (GLP-1 New + Switch) meeting inclusion criteria. Among these patients, 12.1% (9220) switched directly from SU to GLP-1 (GLP-1 Switch). We identified 483 490 SU users, for a total of 3 015 387 potential index dates.

241,"Background: Administrative claims databases often do not capture date of death, so studies using these data may inappropriately treat death as a censoring event,--equivalent to other withdrawal reasons --rather than a competing event. Understanding the influence of not distinguishing between disenrollment and death on cumulative risk estimates is necessary to inform real-world data (RWD) suitability. Objectives: To investigate the influence of specifying death as a censoring event versus competing event on the validity of cumulative risk (CR) estimates. Methods: We examined 1-, 3-, and 5-year CR of a composite outcome (myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalization for congestive heart failure) among initiators of antihypertensive medications telmisartan (exposure) and ramipril (referent) ages 55 in Optum claims (which reliably captures death) from 2003 to 2020. The cohort was created according to eligibility criteria of a published RWD emulation of a randomized clinical trial (NCT00153101). Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to adjust for patient characteristics. Censoring occurred upon disenrollment or end of study. We compared CR estimates from models where death was treated as a censoring event (cause-specific risk [misspecified]) versus competing event (subdistribution risk [truth]). We examined whether error (difference between two estimates) depended on mortality rate. Results: 34 197 patients were included (7036 telmisartan, 27 161 ramipril). 4664 events occurred over 86 616 person-years. Mortality rates per 1000 person-years were 9.8 for ages 55-64, 25.3 for ages 65-74, and 79.1 for ages 75. CR error increased over time, as event and mortality risks increased. Results were similar for both exposure groups. For ramipril users (selected results), true and misspecified CR estimates, respectively, were 14.9 (95% CI 14.4, 15.5) and 15.3 (14.8, 15.9) at year 3 (error ,"" 0.4) and were 21.8 (21.1, 22.5) and 22.8 (22.0, 23.5) at year 5 (error "","" 1.0).

Subsequently, inpatient DEX use increased in the United States (US). Objectives: Determine the 28-day mortality risk for DEX initiation versus no treatment with systemic corticosteroids (CS) among US hospitalized COVID-19 patients on O2 and IMV to develop processes and evaluate methods for rapid cycle real-world treatment effectiveness evidence generation. Methods: We designed an observational cohort study to emulate a hypothetical target trial of COVID-19 inpatients randomized to DEX or non-CS standard of care. Using Health Verity charge master and claims data (April 2020-March 2021), COVID-19 patients initiating DEX within 21 days following admission were matched to patients who had not yet initiated CS based on date, age, sex, comorbidity score, days since admission, and COVID-19 severity (no O2, O2, IMV) at DEX initiation (index). Patients were propensity score (PS) matched 1:1. They were followed from the day after the treatment index date until death (discharge status of expired), discharge, or a 28-day maximum to determine an initial-treatment hazard ratio (IT HR), or start of CS among non-CS for an as-treated HR (AT HR). The AT HR suggested informative censoring; thus, a post hoc IMV subgroup inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) analysis was added to determine if adjustment impacted the AT HR. Results: Of the 804 IMV PS matched pairs, the DEX versus non-CS IT and AT HRs were 1.02 (95% CI 0.89-1.18) and 1.16 (95% CI 0.91- 1.48), respectively; 67% of non-CS patients initiated CS within 7 days after index (48% within 1 day). The AT HR was slightly attenuated with IPCW ranging from 1.09 (95% CI 0.84-1.42) for the full model to 1.02 (95% CI 0.79-1.32) for a model with only data driven covariates. Of the 8008 O2 pairs, IT and AT HRs were 1.32 (95% CI 1.211.45) and 1.76 (95% CI 1.50-2.07); 63% of non-CS patients initiated CS within 7 days after index (47% within 1 day). Conclusions: While post hoc analyzes show that the extent of differential censoring may have obscured an underlying protective effect, the results differed from the RECOVERY trial. Substantial crossover of the referent patients during follow-up was not anticipated. When routine care is rapidly evolving, drug utilization during follow-up should be monitored (keeping treatment-specific outcomes blinded) to increase interpretability of the study findings.",1.0,trial,True

251,"Background: Observational data analyzes regarding COVID-19 vaccines often compare event occurrence relative to vaccinated and unvaccinated person time. Accounting for the time-varying incidence of SARS-CoV-2 and the rapid uptake of COVID-19 vaccines may depend on choice of time scale in Cox regression analyzes. Objectives: To quantify bias in person-time based methods with and without adjustment for calendar time, using simulations. Methods: We simulated 500 000 individuals who were followed for 365 days, and a point exposure (vaccination) with a cumulative incidence proportion of 80%. Exposure dates followed a normal distribution (mean 180, standard deviation [SD] 30) and exposure status was considered a time-varying covariate. Individuals were censored on event occurrence. We generated an effectiveness outcome, emulating the daily risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Denmark during 2021 (cumulative incidence 10%), and a safety outcome with seasonal variation (myocarditis, risk 1/5000). For the effectiveness outcome, we tested true incidence rate ratios (IRR) of 0.1 and 0.5, and for the safety outcome, we tested an IRR of 5.0. Multiple estimators were evaluated: (1) Poisson regression, (2) Cox regression with time-since-vaccination as the scale, and (3) Cox regression with a calendar time scale. For methods 1 and 2, we also obtained calendar time-adjusted estimates (restricted cubic splines). Results: For the effectiveness outcome, mean hazard ratios (HR) with a time-since-vaccination scale were biased (true IRR 0.1, HR 0.38; true IRR 0.5, HR 1.94). The same was observed for Poisson regression (mean IRR 0.26 and 1.26). Adjustment for calendar time reduced bias in Cox (HR 0.17 and 0.74) and Poisson regression (IRR 0.10 and 0.48). Cox regression with calendar time as the underlying time scale yielded unbiased estimates (HR 0.10 and 0.50). For the safety outcome, adjusted estimators yielded results close to the simulated IRR (HR Time-in-study 5.28, HR Calendar time 5.14, IRR 4.69). All estimators were unbiased when analysing a constant rate. Conclusions: Adjusting for the time-varying hazard of outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial, as lack of adjustment may severely bias estimates.

258,"Background: There is a multitude of studies investigating drug interventions for COVID-19. Trials are limited by the inability to include multiple treatment comparisons in a single study and also the lack of representativeness due to restrictive inclusion criteria. Objectives: 1. To empirically evaluate the robustness of simultaneous head-to-head analyzes of multiple treatments and outcomes in real world data (RWD) 2. To estimate the effectiveness and safety of repurposed drugs that satisfied study diagnostics Methods: We conducted a multinational, distributed network cohort study, using a new user, active comparator design and applied study diagnostics (covariate balance, equipoise, and power) to assess the validity of our findings. We included 9 health databases from the United States and Spain mapped to the OMOP common data model. We considered 650 treatment comparisons and 31 outcomes in patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis or positive test in 4 outpatient and inpatient treatment initiation settings. The study period started on 1 January 2020 and ended at the last available date for all data sources (range 23 April to 31 October 2020). We employed variable-ratio propensity score matching and Cox proportional hazard models for each target-comparatoroutcome combination that passed diagnostics with 30-day time-atrisk to estimate the hazard ratio (HR). Results: Of 725 400 potential comparisons, 304 had sufficient size and populations that could be matched, passing diagnostics. Each target-comparator cohort had a median of 7488 (range: 2261- 160 133) patients. Of those comparison-outcome scenarios that satisfied diagnostic criteria, we found a lower risk of cardiovascular events [HR (95% confidence interval) ,"" 0.77 (0.66-0.89)] in hospitalized patients treated with heparin versus aspirin, whereas compared to prednisone, dexamethasone treatment in the outpatient setting had higher risk of complications (requiring intensive services [1.34 (1.04- 1.73)], mechanical ventilation [1.32 (1.02-1.71)], and pneumonia [1.30 (1.20-1.40)]). Conclusions: We investigated a large set of drug exposures and outcomes using multinational RWD for repurposed therapies in COVID19 diagnosed patients and found a small proportion of comparisons could generate effectiveness and safety evidence. We found a lower risk of cardiovascular events among hospitalized patients treated with heparin versus aspirin, and higher rates of complications among outpatients for dexamethasone compared to prednisone. The evidence generated could focus resources for future studies on drug pairs with signals on effectiveness and safety outcomes.""",1.0,COVID-19,True

261,"Background: The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) Initiative performed near real-time safety surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines by comparing observed to expected (historical comparator) rates of pre-specified adverse events of special interest (AESI) following COVID-19 vaccination in a network of large administrative claims databases. There is an inherent delay between the service date when an event is recorded and the date when the event is accessible in claims databases. Ignoring observation delay will underestimate the rate ratios (RRs) and potentially miss detection of a safety signal. Objectives: To describe the assessment and adjustment for observation delay in near real-time safety surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines in claims databases. Methods: We conducted sequential hypothesis testing for prespecified AESI in pre-adjudicated Medicare Shared Systems Data (SSD) and three commercial claims databases (Optum pre-adjudicated, Health Core adjudicated, and CVS Health adjudicated). Using fully accrued data with all claims observable from 2019 in each database, we estimated a delay distribution-the probability that an event is observed within any specified time interval after the service date-for each AESI. Delay distributions were used to adjust the expected rates for near real-time surveillance. Results: Amount of observation delay varied by AESI and database. Overall, claims accrual was faster in pre-adjudicated claims databases: In the pre-adjudicated claims databases, a median of 58%- 77% of AESIs claims accrued within 4 weeks and 92%-93% within 12 weeks. In the adjudicated claims databases, a median of 11% of AESI claims accrued within 4 weeks and 78%-83% within 12 weeks. We observed safety signals for four AESI (acute myocardial infarction [AMI], pulmonary embolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and immune thrombocytopenia) following COVID19 vaccination in the Medicare population that would have remained unidentified without adjustment for the observation delay until near complete data accrual. For instance, AMI would not have signaled early in the surveillance period without adjustment for observation delays in Medicare (delay-adjusted RR , 1.42 vs. unadjusted RR ,"" 0.67).

A proactive pharmacovigilance system, supported by near real time data, was vital to further reassure on safety and support public confidence but also to rapidly detect true rare safety concerns, informing decision-making. Objectives: To continuously evaluate the rate of 19 pre-specified adverse events of special interest (AESI) with COVID-19 vaccines through comparative continuous safety surveillance of electronic healthcare records (EHR). Methods: We conducted repeated weekly Maximized Sequential Probability Ratio Tests within the primary care data of the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to assess the rate of AESI in a risk window post-vaccination compared to a 2015/19 pre-pandemic period. A signal was triggered if the relative risk crossed a threshold based upon the expected number of doses, duration of monitoring, and the pre-pandemic rate. Analyzes were carried out by vaccine brand, dose, and age group with sensitivity analyzes allowing for changes in background rates through the pandemic and adjustments to follow up made to account for delays in recording of AESI in the primary care record. Results: Within two months, 2.4m first doses of a COVID-19 vaccination had been captured in the CPRD. At four months, signals had been raised in-group analyzes across all age groups for 11 AESI-vaccine brand combinations. Of these, 4, Bell's palsy with both AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines, and Guillain-Barré Syndrome and immune thrombocytopenia with AstraZeneca, after evaluation alongside evidence from national and international spontaneous reports and epidemiological studies, have been included within UK vaccine product information as adverse reactions with further signals emerging as the campaign continued. Conclusions: This is the first real time use of these methods exclusively within EHR in the UK and results have contributed to the body of evidence on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, supporting more robust earlier decision-making than that based mainly on spontaneous reports.

271,"Background: Over the past two decades alone, more than 20 new medications have been approved for treatment of T2DM, while in more recent years, sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2i), and to a lesser extent, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA) have shown to reduce the risk of deleterious kidney outcomes among patients co-diagnosed with T2DM and CKD. However, there is paucity of data comparing drug-prescribing patterns among T2DM patients with and without CKD. Objectives: To evaluate trends in antidiabetic medication initiation patterns among type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods: Retrospective cohort study using Clinical Practice Research Datalink (2006-2020) was conducted to evaluate the overall, firstand second line (after metformin) medication initiation patterns among CKD (N , 38 622) and non-CKD (N ,"" 230 963) patients with T2DM. New treatment initiation was defined as no prior use of study medication 365 days prior to date of initiation. Cohort membership was restricted to patients with a recorded serum creatinine (SCr) value, documented T2DM, and no evidence of type 1 or gestational diabetes, cancer, polycystic ovary syndrome, acute kidney injury, or HIV. The most recent SCr value prior to the index date was used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) via the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration equations (CKD-EPI), and an eGFR threshold of <60 ml/min was used to designate patients as having CKD. Results: Relative to other glucose-lowering therapies, metformin initiations declined overall, but remained the treatment of choice as firstline therapy for both CKD and non-CKD patients. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2i) use increased modestly among CKD patients, but this increase was more pronounced among non-CKD patients; by 2020, non-CKD compared to CKD patients were three (28.5% vs. 9.4%) and six (46.3% vs. 7.9%) times more likely to initiate SGLT2i overall and as second-line therapy, respectively. Glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) use was minimal regardless of CKD status (<5%), while both dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i) and sulfonylurea use remained high among CKD patients. For instance, by 2020 and among CKD patients, DPP4i and sulfonylureas comprised of 28.3% and 20.6% of all initiations, and 57.4% and 30.3% of second-line initiations, respectively.

278,"Background: The treatment landscape for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has significantly changed with the introduction of newer drug classes, intended to be used as second-line treatments after metformin. In 2018, guidelines recommended the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1 RA) or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) after metformin to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unknown whether these two second-line antidiabetic drugs are preferentially prescribed in the real-world setting. Objectives: To examine trends of second-line antidiabetic treatments among patients with T2DM initiating first-line metformin in the US, and to examine trends by subgroups of CVD and calendar time. Secondary objectives were to examine trends in a cohort of T2DM patients initiating first-line sulfonylurea, an alternative to metformin. Methods: Using a large commercial US health insurance database, we defined a cohort of adults with T2DM initiating first-line metformin from January 2014 to June 2021. Patients who used other antidiabetic medications in the year prior to cohort entry were excluded. We identified patterns of second-line treatments by class, allowing a 60-day grace period between prescriptions. We stratified patterns by CVD and calendar time to investigate the impact of the new guidelines. Analyzes were repeated among a secondary cohort of sulfonylurea initiators. Results: We identified 148 511 patients initiating treatment with metformin (mean 62 years, 22% with CVD). Overall, 23% of patients initiated a second-line treatment within 2 years of follow-up, with sulfonylurea and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors as the most frequently used classes (43% and 18%, respectively). After 2018, SGLT2i and GLP1 RA were more commonly used as second-line agents (15% and 13%, respectively), compared with before 2018 (11% and 7%, respectively) but these agents were not preferentially prescribed among patients with CVD. In the secondary sulfonylurea cohort (17 951 patients, mean 67 years, 33% with CVD), 37% of patients initiated a second-line agent within 2 years of follow-up, with metformin the overwhelmingly preferred treatment (60%).

Methods: A cohort study was conducted using the Groningen Initiative to ANalyze Type 2 diabetes Treatment (GIANTT) database, which contains electronic medical records from a dynamic cohort of T2D patients from the north of the Netherlands. Patients aged 18 years who initiated metformin in the period 2004-2012, and had follow-up data of 2- 5 years were included. Markov modeling was conducted to estimate treatment transition rates. Transitions included dose changes, switching, discontinuation, addition of another oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA) to metformin, or initiation of insulin. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for all transition rates were calculated, including sex, age, and Hba1c level at baseline as covariates. HbA1c levels at initiation and intensification were compared between the sexes using Mann-Whitney U tests. Results: In total, 12 672-metformin initiators were identified (50.4% women). The most common transition after metformin initiation was a dose increase in both sexes (probability women 0.52, men 0.59: aHR 0.94; 95% CI 0.88-1.00).

Methods: Using nationwide registries in Denmark, we identified a cohort of patients discharged from hospital with a primary inpatient diagnosis of ischemic stroke. For each medication class, we ascertained the 90-day probability of filling a prescription after discharge, stratified by calendar year, considering death as a competing event. For the assessment of trends in use of anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and antidiabetic drugs, we restricted to patients with atrial fibrillation, without atrial fibrillation, and with diabetes, respectively.

304,"Background: US dentists frequently prescribe high-risk medications, including to children <18 years. Opioids, sedatives, and anxiolytics can manage pediatric dental fear and pain. However, child death has occurred after administration in dental settings. Few studies have assessed recent prescribing trends, especially for non-opioids. Objectives: To characterize rates of high-risk prescribing to US pediatric dental patients from 2012 to 2019. Methods: The current study utilized the IQVIA LRx dataset, which captures 92% of all filled outpatient prescriptions by dentists from 2012 to 2019. High-risk prescriptions to children included: opioids, sedatives, benzodiazepines, stimulants, and gabapentin. National trends were calculated using join-point models. Results: From 2012 to 2019, 3.8 million children were exposed to high-risk dental prescriptions (17% of all prescriptions). Among highrisk drugs, opioids were the most common (74.9%), followed by sedatives (12.5%), benzodiazepines (11.7%), stimulants (0.6%), and gabapentin (0.2%). National prescribing rates decreased 63.1% from 10 456 to 3859 days per million children between 2012 and 2019. The decrease was most prominent after 2016 (À6.0% per quarter, vs. À1.6% pre-2016, p-value < 0.001), especially for opioids (À7.0% vs. À1.2%, p-value < 0.001). Adolescents (15-17 years) had high exposure to hydrocodone, which decreased from 12 560 to 6572 days per million (À2.0% per quarter) but, unlike other opioids, did not decrease in 2016. Prescribing of tramadol in children <5 & 5- 9 years was 14.3 & 59.8 per million in 2019, despite FDA contraindications in 2017. Gabapentin rates increased by 8.1%, from 122 to 132 per million. Stimulants had the largest decrease of À89.3%, from 826 to 89 per million. Conclusions: We observed promising decreases in pediatric dental prescribing of high-risk medications from 2012 to 2019.

312,"Background: Neuropsychiatric events (NPEs) encompass a range of signs, symptoms, and diagnoses, some of which are life threatening (e.g., psychosis, seizures, suicidal or homicidal ideation) and require emergency healthcare utilization. The association between use of certain medications and NPEs in children remains unclear, in part because clinical trials were not powered to identify these uncommon yet potentially serious outcomes. Furthermore, while several observational studies have used discharge diagnosis codes to identify pediatric NPEs, the validity of this approach is unknown. Objectives: To develop and validate approaches to accurately identify incident pediatric NPEs requiring hospitalization using administrative data. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional, multicenter study of children 5-17 years of age hospitalized at 2 US children's hospitals with an NPE between April 1, 2016 and March 30, 2020. NPE codes were categorized by clinical significance (e.g., critical or important or unclear) and subtype (e.g., neurologic or psychiatric) based on expert opinion. The Critical category included Homicidal, Suicidal or Self Harm Ideation/Attempts; the Important category includes mood disorders, psychosis, hallucination, altered mental status, movement disorders, encephalitis/encephalopathy and seizures; and, the Unclear Significance category consisted of dizziness, headache, sleeping disorders and vision changes. We developed and evaluated 3 NPE identification algorithms: (1) Primary or secondary NPE ICD-10 diagnosis alone; (2) NPE diagnosis plus indication that the NPE was present on admission plus non-malignancy or surgery-related primary diagnosis; and, (3) Algorithm 2 but without requiring the NPE to be present on admission. Using chart reviews as reference, we computed the positive predictive value (PPV) for each algorithm overall, and by diagnosis field position (primary or any secondary) and clinical significance. Results: There were 1098 NPE hospitalizations included in the study. A total of 857 confirmed NPEs were identified for Algorithm 1, yielding a PPV of 0.78 (95% CI 0.76-0.80).

Methods: A nationwide cohort study utilizing Danish health care registries. All Danish children and adolescents <18 years of age who were either PCR-tested for SARS-CoV-2 until 31 October 2021 or vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine until 02 October 2021 were eligible for inclusion. In evaluation of acute and post-acute outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assessed the risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, serious complications including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), myocarditis and neuroimmune disorders, as well as the risk of initiating drug therapy and health service utilization up to 6 months after testing. Comparing vaccine recipients to unvaccinated peers, we evaluated the vaccine effectiveness towards SARS-CoV-2 infection as one minus the risk ratio at 20 days after the first dose and 60 days after the second dose. Results: Among 961 977 children PCR-tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark, 74 611 (7.8%) tested positive. Among these, 0.49% (95% CI, 0.44 to 0.54) were hospitalized for 12 h or more and 0.01% (0.01 to 0.03) received ICU treatment within 30 days of testing. The risk of MIS-C within two months of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.05% (0.03 to 0.06), whereas there were no cases of myocarditis outside of MIS-C, encephalitis and <5 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

326,"Background: Drug therapy in children and adolescents is often associated with uncertainties. Due to the lack of data from clinical trials and thus the need for off-label use, missing pediatric dosage forms and complex dose calculations, medication errors (ME) occur up to three times more often compared to adults. Moreover, it can be assumed that 3-5% of admissions to pediatric hospitals are due to an adverse drug reaction (ADR). Objectives: The KiDSafe project aimed to significantly improve the existing shortfall in pediatric drug therapy by introducing a structured treatment procedure (PaedPharm) and thereby reduce inpatient admissions due to avoidable side effects and medication errors. Methods: PaedPharm consists of three modules: 1. a digital pediatric drug information system (PaedAMIS), 2. pediatric-pharmacological quality circles (PaedZirk) and 3. a system for mandatory national reporting of ADRs/MEs in the pediatric population (PaedReport). Within KiDSafe all three modules were implemented in a steppedwedge design in 12 territorial clusters, each involving a children's hospital and surrounding pediatricians, psychiatrists and general practitioners. The primary outcome of the intervention was to reduce the proportion of drug-related hospital admissions by one third. The outcome of the implementation of PaedPharm was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively by an independent institute. Results: A total of 41829 patient cases were recorded in the participating hospitals, of which 5101 admissions could be assigned to the participating doctors (n ,"" 152). Under control conditions, a population-based mean of 4.14% of the admissions were due to an ADR or ME. Under intervention, however, it was 3.07%. The modelbased comparison resulted in a population-based odds ratio ("",""effect of intervention) of 0.73 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.37; p-value 0.33). The PaedAMIS database was well accepted, and PaedZirk achieved a particular high level of acceptance.

Methods: CARTO procedural ablation characteristics were loaded to CARTONET (a cloud-based artificial intelligence powered system) and linked to de-identified Mercy Health electronic health record (EHR) data among AF patients who underwent ablation. The first ablation was classified as the index ablation. Following an automatic anatomical segmentation of the atria, LA dilation was calculated as the ratio of posterior width to posterior height. Patient characteristics (AF type, BMI, age, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index score, and CHA2DS2-VASC score) were assessed at index and derived from EHR. Logistic regression examined the relationship of LA dilation with: (1) AF type at index and 2) AF recurrence 12-month post-ablation (a composite of repeat ablation, electrical cardioversion, and AF rehospitalization), controlling for patient characteristics. Results: Among 202 patients, PsAF had significantly lower LA dilation scores than PAF patients (1.61 vs. 1.79, <0.005).

Follow-up stopped at b/tsDMARD stop or a maximum of 15 months. We assessed comparative effectiveness of b/tsDMARDs (ref. adalimumab) using Cox proportional hazard regression in each patient group by estimating hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We validated results obtained per group through stratified analyzes according to most distinctive patient characteristics of the respective group. Results: We obtained 24 clusters, which comprised 362-1481 patients (3516 unique patients). These clusters were grouped according to most distinct characteristics at b/tsDMARD initiation: (1) 2 conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs and prednisone use, (2) male sex, (3) seronegativity, female sex, and no prednisone use, (4) rather low disease burden, (5) seropositivity, female sex, and a rather high disease burden/duration. Comparative effectiveness results among validation strata confirmed comparative effectiveness results among the groups: Patients with 2 csDMARDs and prednisone use, men, as well as patients with a lower disease burden responded better to tocilizumab than to adalimumab (HRs of treatment response: 5.46, 95% CI [1.76-16.94], HR 8.44 [3.43-20.74], and HR 3.64 [2.04-6.49], respectively). Furthermore, seronegative women without use of prednisone as well as seropositive women with a higher disease burden/duration had a higher risk of nonresponse with golimumab (HRs of b/tsDMARD stop: 2.36 [1.03- 5.40] and HR 5.27 [2.10-13.21], respectively) than with adalimumab. Conclusions: RA patient groups identified by deep clustering may respond differently to individual first-line b/tsDMARDs. Thus, our results may support the decision on the best choice of first-time b/tsDMARD for certain RA patients, which is a step forward towards personalizing treatment.",1.0,disease,True

357,"Background: Vitamin K-antagonists (VKAs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are widely used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Recent studies indicate that anticoagulant therapy may be associated with kidney complications with lower risks related to DOACs compared with VKAs. However, these studies suffer from methodological limitations, which we aim to address using the unique Danish setting of population-based medical databases. Objectives: To examine the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in patients initiating DOACs and VKAs. Methods: We conducted a new user active comparator cohort study in patients who started oral anticoagulant drug use within three months after an atrial fibrillation diagnosis during 2012 to 2018. Using routinely collected creatinine measurements from laboratory databases, we followed patients in an intension-to-treat approach for AKI and CKD progression. AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria; CKD progression was a composite of >30% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or kidney failure. Propensity-score weighting was used to balance baseline confounders; we reported weighted absolute risks using the Aalen-Johansen estimator and weighted hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox regression. Consistency was checked within prespecified subgroups. Results: We included 33 670 persons with atrial fibrillation initiating oral anticoagulation with 77% in the DOAC cohort. The median age was 75 years, 48% were women, and 25% had a baseline eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. The median follow-up was 2.3 years. Absolute risks of kidney complications were high: During the first year of treatment the cumulative risk of AKI was 13.9% in the DOAC group and 15.5% in the VKA group; the 5-year risk of CKD progression was 14.0% in DOAC users and 15.4% in VKA users. Compared to VKA initiation, DOAC treated patients had lower rates of both AKI and CKD progression with HRs of 0.85 (95% CI [0.81; 0.89]) and 0.84 (95% CI [0.78; 0.91]) respectively. Results were similar across subgroups of age, sex, baseline eGFR, and diabetes. Conclusions: Kidney complications were common among atrial fibrillation patients initiating oral anticoagulant drugs.

363,"Background: The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) empagliflozin has shown reductions in major adverse cardiac events (MACE) similar to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) in routine care in Denmark. There is limited evidence how these therapies compare regarding overall costs associated with healthcare resources utilization. Objectives: To assess the total average healthcare costs per patient after drug initiation with empagliflozin versus GLP-1RAs in Denmark. Methods: Nationwide population-based comparative cohort study based on linked prospective healthcare databases for the entire population in Denmark (current population 5.8 million) during Jan 1, 2015, and to Dec 31, 2018. We included 13 249 new users of empagliflozin and 13 747 new users of GLP-1RAs. Propensity scores were applied to balance potential confounders across the two treatment groups through inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW). We assessed total average costs per year associated with all healthcare resource utilization (inpatient, emergency room, and outpatient clinic hospital care, primary care health services, and prescription medications costs at pharmacies) among drug initiators while on-treatment (i.e., while covered by filled drug prescriptions including a grace period of 60 days). Results: The two IPTW cohorts were well-balanced at baseline (median age 61 years, 60% men, diabetes duration of 6.7 years, 19% with pre-existing ischemic heart disease, 8% with history of cerebrovascular disease). Healthcare costs in the year prior to drug initiation were also well balanced. Mean follow-up on-treatment after initiation was 11.3 months (SD 9.8 months) in empagliflozin vs 12.3 (SD 10.9) months in GLP-1 RA initiators, with a total of 12 657 years of drug exposure with empagliflozin and 13 554 years with GLP-1RAs. Average costs per patient per year were very similar in empagliflozin and GLP-1 RA initiators regarding inpatient hospitalizations (13 565 DKK versus 13 275 DKK), hospital outpatient clinic visits (12 007 DKK versus 12 152 DKK), emergency room visits (370 DKK versus 399 DKK), and primary care services (4108 DKK versus 4302 DKK). Total costs of any prescription drugs were lower in empagliflozin initiators (8946 DKK versus 14 029 DKK).

367,"Background: Myasthenic syndromes are typically characterized by muscle weakness and increased fatigability due to an impaired transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ); most cases are caused by acquired autoimmune conditions such as myasthenia gravis (MG). Different drugs are among the major factors that may complicate preexisting autoimmune myasthenic conditions by further impairing transmission at the NMJ. Objectives: To quantify disproportionate reporting (Disp-Rep) for the risk of drug-associated MG for 41 clinically approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in 2 groups: (1) Anti-angiogenic (AA) TKIs; 2) Nonanti-angiogenic (NAA) TKIs. Methods: We used the AERS and VigiBase databases, with data up to Dec2021 and Mar2022 for analysis respectively. Cases of MG were identified using MedDRA (v24.1) and the preferred-term (PT) `myasthenia gravis' (MG). Empirical Bayes Geometric Means (EBGM) with 90% CI were calculated to quantify Disp-Rep. We considered the lower bound of the 90% CI, EB05 > 2 as the threshold for claiming an observation of Disp-Rep. We studied 3 groups of drugs: (1) Positive control group (non-TKIs associated with MG: penicillamine and prednisone) and two groups of TKIs: (2) AA TKIs & (3) NAA TKIs. Drugs were identified by non-proprietary name. Results: We retrieved 392 MG cases in AERS and 281 in VigiBase. In AERS, Disp-Rep with EBGM [90% CI, EB05-EB95] was confirmed for the positive control group: prednisone 3.21 [2.92- 3.52] and in VigiBase for penicillamine 6.40 [2.48-34.12] and prednisone 5.80 [5.19-6.46].

However, the topic remains debated due to the conflicting results published in recent systematic review and meta-analysis studies. Objectives: To identify the safety signals of anti-diabetic medications related to pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma, which are not determined to date using post-marketing surveillance data. Methods: We carried out a retrospective case/non-case study using spontaneous reports in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and Canada Vigilance of Adverse Reaction Online Database (CVAR) from the date of approval by the FDA to 1 June 2022. A disproportionality analysis was performed by calculating the Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), and the Information Component (IC) to identify pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma signal (if PRR  2, Lower Bound (LB) ROR > 1 and IC025 > 0) for anti-diabetic drugs. We also performed a signal refinement analysis by eliminating the confounding co-prescribed medications to identify the robustness of the findings.

378,"Background: Liraglutide (Saxenda®) demonstrated its superior efficacy for weight management and well-tolerated safety in clinical trials. However, clinical trials involve studying in a relatively small number of selected individuals for a short period. Unexpected adverse drug reactions (ADRs), not identified in clinical trials, can emerge once liraglutide has been used by a large population and over a long period. Objectives: To detect unexpected adverse events (AEs) that may be attributed to liraglutide in the Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management-Korea adverse event reporting system database (KIDS-KD) Methods: We investigated the safety signals of liraglutide by implementing a gradient boosting machine (GBM) algorithm in the KIDS-KD from 2017 to 2020. To identify candidates of unexpected AEs, our investigators reviewed drug labels of liraglutide and other drugs in the same therapeutic class (GLP-1 agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors) in the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. Based on the reviewed labels, we classified 189 AEs reported with liraglutide into three ADR categories: (a) label-positive; (b) label-negative; (c) unknown. Given label-positive and negative ADRs, we developed prediction models based on demographic and clinical characteristics, causality assessment by clinical experts, and statistical indices. Then, we validated the performance of prediction models by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) and precision-recall curve (AUPRC). The optimal model, achieving the highest scores of AUROC and AUPRC, was implemented to detect safety signals among unknown ADRs. Results: Among a total of 972 193 reports, 1201 reports were reported with liraglutide in South Korea. In the phase of model development and validation, we generated the optimal prediction model with the comparable performance on the classification of safety signals (AUROC: 0.8558, AUPRC: 0.9538). Our model detected 33 of 56 unknown ADRs as safety signals including psychiatric disorders, infections, and musculoskeletal disorders. Six safety signals indicated that liraglutide may attribute to psychiatric disorders (suicide attempts, depression, aggression, affect lability, apathy, and derealization disorder). Conclusions: Although pre-approval clinical trials showed that liraglutide is associated with a relatively lower psychiatric risk than other anti-obesity drugs, our study identified six potential ADRs related to psychiatric events during post-approval use of liraglutide.

Objectives: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between BC and subsequent incident T2D overall, and according to the receipt of BC treatments--endocrine therapy (ET) (tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs)) and chemotherapy. Methods: Through September 2021, PubMed, Embase, and references of relevant papers were searched for studies on BC, BC treatment, and subsequent T2D risk. We initially screened papers by title and abstract and subsequently reviewed for eligibility and data extraction. Using random-effects models, we calculated summary relative risks (RRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of T2D for BC versus no cancer; and according to BC treatments: ET versus no ET, tamoxifen versus no tamoxifen, AIs versus no AIs, and chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy. Both non-cancer referents and BC patients who did not use the treatment in question were used separately as referents in the analyzes of ET, tamoxifen, and AIs. We used funnel plots to assess publication bias. Results: Among 14 studies eligible for inclusion, 7 reported on the association between BC and T2D risk; 3 on chemotherapy and T2D; 8 on ET (6 on tamoxifen and 4 on AIs) and T2D; and 4 studies investigated more than one association. The pooled RR of incident T2D after BC versus no cancer was 1.29 (95% CI , 1.17-1.43).

This information can help to identify situations of misuse, making morbidity data useful as part of an active surveillance system for monitoring psychoactive medicines' misuse. Objectives: To characterize admissions to emergency departments of Portuguese hospitals of patients presenting a diagnosis of abuse, poisoning or dependence of psychoactive medicines. Methods: Retrospective observational study of visits to emergency departments (ED) of Portuguese hospitals of patients presenting at least one diagnosis of misuse of psychoactive medicines, coded as abuse, poisoning or dependence (2014-2018). The variables studied were demographic characteristics of individuals, therapeutic classes of medicines involved, hospitalization length, episode severity, type of diagnoses and mortality risk. Results: A total number of 13 815 admissions took place in Portuguese hospitals, increasing during the 5-year period (1781 in 2014 to 3934 in 2018), 7593 females (55%) and 6222 males, with a mean age of 47.4 years. In 88% of ED visits there was effective hospitalization (mean length of stay: 11.3 days). Although more than half of the studied admissions were for other reasons, the diagnoses of interest not causing the ED visit (secondary diagnoses), about 48% of cases were due to psychoactive medicines' misuse, with a total of 9357 cases with at least one poisoning diagnosis, 3807 with dependence and 968 with an abuse diagnosis. There were statistical differences regarding the median duration of hospitalization in admissions caused by misuse compared to the remaining studied admissions. A quarter of cases were of extreme and major severity (33% minor), with 18% of admissions presenting extreme and major mortality risks. Top therapeutic classes responsible for hospital admissions were anxiolytics (65%), followed by antidepressants (16%) both with a clear female predominance (73 and 75%, respectively), as opposed to prescription and illegal opioids (that caused only 3.4% of ED visits, 65% of which men). However, these admissions due to prescription and illegal opioids had a median duration of hospitalization significantly higher (6 days) than the remaining users admitted due to misuse of other psychoactive therapeutic classes. Conclusions: Our preliminary results show that anxiolytics, especially benzodiazepines, as well as antidepressants, are the main types of therapeutic groups responsible for hospital admissions involving psychoactive medicines, which show significant severity.

Methods: A new CAC user cohort of AYAs 15-39 years-old was identified from the 10% sample of IQVIA PharMetrics® Plus for Academics administrative claims data (2006-2015). New users had no evidence of CAC (i.e., anthracyclines, monoclonal antibodies, pyrimidine antimetabolites, nitrogen mustards and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs) in the 6 months prior to the first CAC dispensing (i.e., index date). Concurrent use was defined as 1 day overlap of either strong (citalopram, escitalopram) or weak (all other antidepressants) QTcprolonging antidepressants in the 21 days before and including the CAC index date. MACE is a composite outcome based on the earliest diagnosis or procedure code for atrial or ventricular arrhythmia/fibrillation, coronary revascularization, heart failure, myocardial infarction, valvular disease, or stroke. Censoring events are the earliest of MACE, enrollment lapse, or study end (12/31/15).

In the ADAMPA trial, self-monitoring plus self-titration showed promising results for reducing blood pressure at 12 months, without increasing healthcare utilization or adverse events. Objectives: We extended the ADAMPA trial for up to 2 years (as planned) to evaluate the longer-term effectiveness of selfmonitoring plus self-titration of antihypertensive medication versus usual care in poorly controlled hypertensive patients, with passive follow-up and primary-care nursing involvement. Methods: Design: The ADAMPA study was a pragmatic, controlled, randomized, non-masked clinical trial with two parallel arms in Valencia, Spain; Participants: Hypertensive patients older than 40 years, with SBP over 145 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) over 90 mmHg, recruited from July 2017 to June 2018; Intervention: Participants were randomized 1:1 to usual care versus an individualized, pre-arranged plan based on self-monitoring plus self-titration; Outcomes: The primary outcome was the adjusted mean difference (AMD) in SBP between groups at the end of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were: AMD in DBP, proportion of patients with optimal control, change in behaviors, quality of life, health services utilization and adverse events. Statistical analysis: Intention to treat analysis. A linear mixed-effects model was used to compare SBP between groups (as pre-specified). Differences in DBP were assessed using similar techniques.

Inverse probability of censoring and (for the new user design only) treatment weighted estimators were used to estimate the counterfactual risk and risk difference functions. Results: The true risk difference in the simulated cohort at 6 months was 10.6%. The unadjusted 6-month risk difference was 14.2% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 11.0%, 17.5%).

447,"we explored the relationship between relative bias and ASAM with the following PS metrics: 1. AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve), 2. Calibration slope, and 3. Brier score. Lastly, we tested different hyperparameters and reported the treatment effect estimation bias and the best metrics for PS estimation from the previous step. Results: We found that with fixed ML hyper-parameters, Brier score and calibration slope performed best at predicting bias after PS matching for both OR. For example, with OR 1.5, the lowest relative bias was obtained by MLP at 19.78% (95% CI: 15.22%, 24.32%), with calibration slope 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) and Brier score 0.27 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.29) being the best among all tested ML methods. Conversely, AUC was not consistently associated with bias. For example, RF had the best AUC at 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98, 1) but led to the largest bias at 34.32% (95% CI: 30.20%, 38.44%). Experiments after hyperparameter tests for different ML models also showed that PS models with better Brier scores and calibration slopes can generate the lowest bias. Conclusions: We found metrics including calibration (Brier score and calibration slope) were useful evaluation metrics for model selection and hyper-parameter tuning of PS estimation using ML models. Conversely, discrimination estimates (AUC) could be misleading, with some scenarios showing almost perfect discrimination but very large bias. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to provide guidance for data-driven ML-based PS estimation.",1.0,Area,True

450,Background: Immortal time bias is introduced when treatment initiation occurs after time zero of follow-up and is common in observational studies of medication use during pregnancy. Objectives: To describe how emulating a series of hypothetical randomized trials (target trials) avoids immortal time bias and apply the approach to antibiotic initiation and preterm delivery. Methods: The Tsepamo Study captured birth outcomes at up to 18 delivery sites in Botswana from 2014-2021. To investigate the relationship between antibiotic initiation after 24 weeks gestation and preterm delivery (24-37 weeks gestation) among women presenting for antenatal care <24 weeks gestation we: (1) started follow-up at 24 weeks and defined exposure as antibiotic initiation between 24 and 37 weeks gestation (susceptible to immortal time bias) and (2) conducted 13 sequential target trials of antibiotic initiation versus,1.0,trial,True
451,"no initiation during each week from 24 to 37 weeks gestation. For each trial, eligible women had not previously initiated antibiotics and remained pregnant at the start of that week. We used log-binomial models to calculate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Of 111 403 eligible women, 17 009 (15%) initiated antibiotics between 24 and 37 weeks gestation. The RR (95% CI) for preterm delivery comparing antibiotic initiation to no initiation between 24 and 37 weeks was 0.92 (0.89, 0.96). In the series of target trials which address immortal time bias, the RRs (95% CIs) ranged from 1.06 (0.93, 1.22) to 1.28 (1.14, 1.43). Conclusions: Because the time period between time zero and treatment initiation is ""immortal"" to the outcome, defining exposure based on treatment initiation after time zero biased the RR for the association between antibiotic initiation and preterm delivery downwards. Conducting a series of target trials can avoid this immortal time bias in pregnancy studies by aligning exposure initiation and start of follow-up.",1.0,trial,True

Objectives: To apply the CCW method for evaluating effect of timing of chemotherapy in relation to surgery for stage II-III, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) using the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Methods: We identified incident female, stage II-III, adult (18- 75 years) TNBC patients from 2013 to 2016 using the American College of Surgeons NCDB. We first cloned each patient and assigned each clone to 1 of the 2 treatment strategies. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) strategy was defined as initiating chemotherapy within 9 weeks from diagnosis followed by surgery within 36 weeks from diagnosis. The adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) strategy was defined as surgery within 9 weeks from diagnosis followed by initiating chemotherapy within 18 weeks from diagnosis. Clones were followed from diagnosis until death or end of data availability. Clones were analytically censored in their treatment arm when their observed treatment pattern deviated from the assigned strategy. For example, clones assigned to NACT were analytically censored at 9 weeks if they did not initiate chemotherapy within 9 weeks of diagnosis.

Results: Covariates were balanced between treatments across all PS strategies. CVD conditions included in a subgroup were slightly more balanced after stratified PS matching.

Ectopic pregnancy was defined as having at least two recorded diagnoses of ectopic pregnancy within 30 days, or one diagnosis and one surgical procedure for ectopic pregnancy. Incidence rates per 1000 womenyears and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each method of contraception. A Cox regression model adjusted for age, history of endometriosis, previous ectopic pregnancy and contraceptive class was fitted to time to ectopic pregnancy. The fitted model was used for prediction of survival probabilities. Results: The study included 1 663 242 women and 1915 events of ectopic pregnancy. The estimated incidence rate per 1000 womenyears for ectopic pregnancy per method of hormonal contraception (95% CI) was: Hormonal IUD 13.5 mg 2.76 (2.26 to 3.35), Hormonal IUD 52 mg 0.30 (0.28 to 0.33), Oral combined contraception 0.20 (0.19 to 0.22), Progestogen implants 0.31 (0.26 to 0.37), Oral medium dose progestogen 0.24 (0.21 to 0.27) Oral low-dose progestogen 0.81 (0.70 to 0.93). The highest predicted risk for ectopic pregnancy was seen in women less than 40 years of age with a previous history of ectopic pregnancy using the IUD with 13.5 mg of progestogen. According to the model, approximately 9 cases of ectopic pregnancy in 100 treatments are expected during 2.5- 3 years of use. Conclusions: Hormonal contraception lowers the risk of ectopic pregnancy markedly. Women using a low-dose hormone IUD (13.5 mg levonorgestrel) had a substantially higher risk of ectopic pregnancy than women using other types of hormonal contraception.

Proportions of patients with comorbidities and pain-related drug prescribing history were higher in GPN users than non-users (e.g., psychoactive substance misuse: 0.59% vs. 0.17%).

Patients in the intervention group were 20% more likely to have at least one medication de-prescribed than individuals in the medication review control group (aOR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.03-1.39), whereas they were 42% more likely to de-prescribe at least one medication compared to nonmedication review controls (aOR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.25-1.61). PPI discontinuations were not impacted by the educational webinar (aOR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.76-1.48), whereas a slight non-significant impact on statin discontinuations was observed (aOR: 1.23; 95% CI: 0.64-2.36).

498,"Background: The use of benzodiazepines (BZD) is associated with risk of addiction and benzodiazepine users frequently co-medicate with opioids. Trajectories of use and how these is associated with opioid use has rarely been studied before. Objectives: To characterize trajectories of use among elderly new benzodiazepine users and to describe how the use of opioids change between the different trajectories. Methods: The study population consists of all elderly (aged 65 and older) in Norway who received at least one prescription of benzodiazepines in 2013. The group based trajectory model (GBTM) uses 360 days of dispensed prescriptions after the initial prescription. The data was divided into twelve 30 days periods and the number of DDD dispensed in each period was calculated. These numbers were normalized by dividing each period with the number of DDDs of the first period. Three groups were created using quadratic terms. Exposure to BZD is defined as any prescription dispensed in ATC class N05A. Incident use is defined as no use in the previous 12 months. Exposure to opioids is defined as any prescription dispensed in ATC class N02A. Statin exposure was used as a control and is defined as dispensed prescriptions in ATC class C10AA. Change in use is measured as the number of DDD dispensed in the three months preceding the incident benzodiazepine dispensation compared with the number of DDD dispensed in the final three months of the follow-up window. Results: 54.8% of incident BZD users (33293 persons) in 2013 had only one prescription dispensed. Of the elderly with more than one prescription, GBTM created three groups.

Objectives: To evaluate associations between characteristics of transmucosal (TM) buprenorphine treatment within 30 days of initiation and incidence of opioid-related overdose deaths. Methods: Using prescription-monitoring data, we identified a cohort of adult Kentucky residents who initiated TM buprenorphine treatment for OUD from Jan 2017 to Nov 2019 and did not die or switch to long-acting injectable (LAI) buprenorphine within 30 days of initiation. The average daily dose of the initial prescription and that during the first 30 days were respectively categorized as 8 mg, >8 to 16 mg, and >16 mg.

We examined the association between a time-varying exposure of rapid dose reduction/ discontinuation (>10% dose reduction/week) versus maintenance, increase, or gradual reduction/discontinuation and evidence of incident opioid overdose (fatal or nonfatal) or diagnosed OUD. We estimated inverse probability-weighted cumulative incidence and used marginal structural Fine-Gray models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of each outcome as a function of rapid dose tapering/discontinuation, accounting for competing risks. Results: We identified 19 443 individuals who received high-dose long-term opioid therapy. Rapid reduction/discontinuation was associated with higher risk of fatal and nonfatal overdoses (4-year RD 1.44%, 95% CI: 0.78-2.09), and this impact increased with longer follow-up time (Year 1: HR 1.43, 95% CI: 0.94-2.18; Years 2-4: HR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.31-2.90).

Methods: In multi-year (2011-2018), cross-sectional analyzes of disabled, non-cancer beneficiaries with >2 opioid prescriptions, we examined geographic variation in high-dose use (120 daily morphine milligram equivalents for 90 consecutive days), multiple providers (receiving opioid prescriptions from 4 prescribers and 4 pharmacies), and concurrent benzodiazepine use (30 cumulative days). Using multivariable logistic regression (marginal effects), we obtained annual rates of high-risk opioid use across 306 Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care hospital referral regions (HRRs), adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical confounders. We examined trends using the MannKendall test and conducted spatio-temporal analyzes to identify 3 types of HRR hotspots: (1) persistent (hotspots for 90% of study period without any apparent trend), (2) consecutive (newly identified in the past 3 years), and (3) intensifying (90% of study period with increasing trends).

Hotspots of the multiple providers measure were often neighboring regions of high-dose use. Conclusions: Among disabled Medicare beneficiaries, we identified high-risk opioid use hotspots in 20%-30% of HRRs, which may aid in developing targeted regional-level interventions and policies to reduce potentially inappropriate opioid use and prescribing.

Little is known about opioid use patterns most associated with OUD or OD in BC survivors.

Methods: A retrospective cohort included female Medicare beneficiaries with incident nonmetastatic BC who received 1 noninjectable opioid prescription using 2010-2019 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results linked Medicare data. We excluded those with OUD, OD, other substance use disorders, or received methadone/buprenorphine for OUD before initiating BC active therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, radiation, or cancer surgery).

Objectives: To study the association between use of 32AR agonists and risk of PD in persons with asthma or COPD. Methods: The study was conducted within the register-based Finnish Parkinson's disease (FINPARK) study, a case-control study nested within population of Finland. This study included 1406 cases with clinically verified PD diagnosed during 1999-2015, who also had asthma/COPD >3 years before PD.

Suggestion of inverse association was seen for highest quartile of long-acting 32AR agonists in asthma (aOR 0.74; 95% CI 0.55-1.01). Conclusions: Higher levels of exposure to 32AR agonists were not consistently associated with reduced risk of PD among persons with asthma/COPD.

536,"Background: Intentional self-poisoning increased by more than 50% in the US among young people aged 10 to 24 years over the past decade. Among the most common medications identified in these suicide attempts are non-prescription analgesics such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and aspirin. Ready availability and access coupled with unsafe storage practices further make this a persistent problem. Assessing the trends in suicide attempts with these analgesics could inform strategies for safer access and storage of these analgesics. Objectives: To assess trends in intentional self-poisoning and suspected suicide with nonprescription analgesics from 2016 to 2021. Methods: The National Poison Data System (NPDS) contains data from cases reported to all 55 US poison control centers. The NPDS collects near real-time de-identified data on overdoses or poisonings with specific products and substances. This unique data source provides an opportunity to examine current trends in selfpoisoning with non-prescription analgesics and describe age-group differences in exposure. We conducted a descriptive analysis of trends in poisonings with four-selected non-prescription, single ingredient adult formulation analgesics from NPDS data collected from 2016 to 2021. Annual case counts of all human exposures, intentional poisonings, suspected suicide attempts, major clinical effects and deaths from acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen were extracted from NPDS, plotted over time, and compared across age groups (0-5, 6-12, 13-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-69, 70+ years). Results: There was substantial variability by age group; of the total 321 455 suspected suicide poisoning calls during the review period, 13-19-year-old individuals were the leading age group, constituting 50.6% (162 804) of all suspected suicide attempts by poisoning while the 70+ year old age group constituted 1.1% (3585) of all cases. Overall, ibuprofen was the leading drug (44.3%) used in suspected suicide attempts from 2016 through 2019. After 2019, acetaminophen was the leading non-prescription analgesic (45.4%) used in suicide attempts, most prominently in the 13-19-year age group. Aspirin was the least used analgesic for suicide attempts overall. Conclusions: Suicide attempts using non-prescription analgesics is a growing problem in the teenage population.

542,"Background: Opioid (OP) and/or benzodiazepine (BZ) use in older adults causes central nervous system depression and can increase risk of falls/fractures compared to individual use. While clinical guidelines do not recommend concurrent use, OP-BZ use might be warranted for patients with pain and other conditions (e.g., anxiety); thus, there is need to understand the differential risk of falls/fractures among distinct OP, BZ, and OP-BZ use trajectories Objectives: To investigate the dose/duration patterns of OP, BZ, and OP-BZ use most associated with injurious falls (including fractures) Methods: This retrospective cohort study included fee-for-service, non-cancer Medicare beneficiaries initiating OP and/or BZ in 2016- 2018. We excluded patients with falls/fractures or accidental injuries within 6 months before drug initiation. Based on average daily morphine milligram equivalents (MME) for OPs and diazepam milligram equivalents (DME) for BZs, we used group-based multi-trajectory models to identify distinct OP/BZ/OP-BZ dose/duration patterns in the 3 months after drug initiation.

Further population-based research is warranted to evaluate the association between antipsychotics and acute respiratory failure, and to provide evidence that is generalizable to the United States. Objectives: To evaluate the association between the use of antipsychotics and risk of respiratory depression among commercially insured adults in the United States. Methods: We performed a retrospective new-user cohort study of adults 18 years prescribed an antipsychotic or an active comparator, anticonvulsant medication, during an eight-year period spanning 2007 to 2015, using a 1% random sample of enrollees within the IQVIA PharMetrics® Plus for Academics Database.

In UK primary care, treatment is suboptimal with up to 30% of indicated patients being treated within five years of diagnosis and once prescribed allopurinol, treatment adherence is poor. Studies evaluating effect of allopurinol have ignored the time-varying propensity for treatment, which may be due to changing patient health and risk of poor outcome over time. Objectives: To estimate the effect of allopurinol on a range of outcomes in people with gout accounting for time-varying confounding by indication. Methods: Cohort study of primary care medical records from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) included adults aged 18 years consulting for gout between 1997 and 2002, and not prescribed urate-lowering drugs 2 years prior. Allopurinol prescription 3 months and covariates (demographics, comorbidities, other medication usage, and number of years previously prescribed allopurinol) were measured yearly from the date of first gout consultation. Marginal structural models estimated the effect of allopurinol on time to reaching target serum urate (SU) level 360mol/L, mortality, hospitalization due to gout, hip or knee joint replacement, and various comorbidities. Confounding was accounted for using inverse probability of treatment weights. Weights were derived in each year of follow up by estimating the propensity of initiating and continuing allopurinol given covariates via logistic regression models. Subsequently, weighted Cox regression models estimated the effect of allopurinol on outcome. Results: A 16 876 adults (mean age 62 years, 77% male) consulted for gout and were followed up for a median 10.7 years.

591,"Background: Pimavanserin is the only drug approved in the United States (US) to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP); other atypical antipsychotics are sometimes used off-label in patients with PDP. In the US, all antipsychotic drugs carry a boxed warning in their approved labeling concerning an increased risk of death in older patients with dementia-related psychosis. Objectives: To compare mortality risk among patients with PDP after initiation of pimavanserin with mortality risk after initiation of comparator atypical antipsychotics and to evaluate whether mortality risk varies over time or across subgroups. Methods: A retrospective cohort of patients aged 65 years and diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) and psychosis initiating pimavanserin or a comparator antipsychotic (clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole) were identified in 2016-2019 Medicare claims data. Differences in treatment group characteristics were balanced with 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching. Incidence of all-cause mortality between the two groups was compared with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) estimated with Cox proportional hazard models. Time period-specific models evaluated changes in risk over time. Analyzes were repeated in subgroups, including long-term care (LTC) or skilled nursing facility (SNF) residents on the index date.

Such population-based findings with broad generalizability are important, especially for COPD patients who regularly use ICS therapy and are considered at high risk of severe COVID-19. Objectives: To investigate whether ongoing regular exposure to ICS affects risk, severity, or survival in SARS-CoV-2 infection, using a nationwide linked Swedish population register database. Methods: From Jan to Dec 2020, we studied two defined Swedish adult populations 40 years (general population, and COPD patients) in three different study cohorts (with corresponding index dates): 1. overall cohort (index date 1 Jan 2020), 2. individuals with COVID-19-onset (diagnosis date), and 3. hospitalized COVID-19 patients (admission date).

Methods: Using charge master data from 297 hospitals, we identified pediatric patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis admitted to the hospital between February 2020 and December 2021. The associations between baseline characteristics and serious outcomes (ICU, ventilation, mortality) were evaluated by estimating the risk of experiencing each outcome by hospital day 60 (using an inverse-probability of censoring weighted estimator of cumulative risk). Patients who were still hospitalized at time of data abstraction were censored. For all outcomes, hospital discharge was treated as a competing risk. For ICU admission and ventilation, death was also treated as a competing risk. Results: Among 6631 pediatric patients, 615 were admitted to the ICU, 313 received ventilation, and 59 died.

Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is often used as a clinical target in T2DM management. Identifying distinct clusters of HbA1c trajectories may help to develop more personalized strategies for T2DM management. Objectives: To identify and characterize common patterns of HbA1c progression among T2DM patients who initiate a non-insulin antidiabetic drug in the UK. Methods: The IQVIA Medical Research Data incorporating data from THIN, a Cegedim database of anonymized electronic health records, was used to identify all patients with 4 HbA1c measurements after a first-ever prescription for a non-insulin antidiabetic drug (NIAD; index date) between 2006 and 2019. Patient trajectory clusters were identified using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm by iteratively fitting k thin-plate splines and reassigning each patient to the nearest cluster. Clusters were characterized based on evidence of initial response (adequate/inadequate) and long-term control. A maintained decline in HbA1c for 6 months after index defined adequate response. HbA1c values at 10-years defined long-term response in 4 categories: optimally controlled (<7.0%), controlled (7.0%-7.5%), sub optimally controlled (7.6%-9.0%), and poorly controlled (>9.0%). Cox proportional hazards models estimated the risk of retinopathy between clusters. Results: We identified 116 251 new users of NIADs with 4 HbA1c measurements. We found five distinct clusters of HbA1c progression: adequate--controlled (A-C), adequate--optimally controlled (A-OC), adequate--sub optimally controlled (A-SOC), inadequate --sub optimally controlled (I-SOC), and inadequate--poorly controlled (I-PC).

Large-scale confounder selection in ultra-highdimensional data remains challenging, particularly when outcome events are rare. These situations are increasing in drug-safety and effectiveness research as linked electronic health records with claims data are becoming more available. Objectives: We aimed to investigate the performance of several lasso-based methods for large-scale confounder selection in ultrahigh-dimensional data with rare outcomes using simulated datasets. Methods: We simulated datasets with a sample size of 5000, outcome incidence of 2%, treatment prevalence of 30%, and 10 000 binary baseline covariates (100 confounders, 10 risk factors, and 10 instrumental and 9880 spurious variables). We estimated the propensity score (PS) using 4 lasso-based models: (1) treatment lasso, (2) outcomeadaptive lasso, (3) collaborative-controlled lasso, (4) collaborativecontrolled outcome-adaptive lasso. Model 1 chooses variables to optimize treatment prediction while Model 2 prioritizes variables based on the strength of estimated associations with the outcome. Model 3 utilizes the `collaborative learning' framework to consider variable associations with both treatment and outcome with the goal to minimize a bias-variance tradeoff in the estimated treatment effect. Finally, Model 4 extends Model 3 by placing a higher weight on predictors of the outcome prior to running Model 3. We fit each model using traditional",1.0,,True

Results: In terms of cross-validated predictive performance for treatment, model 1 performed best followed by models 2, 3, then 4 (Cstatistics ranging from 0.7 to 0.75). However, in terms of reducing bias in the estimated treatment effect, model 4 consistently performed best (bias reduction of 72% relative to the unadjusted estimate). After re-running all models using the relaxed-lasso fit, the final models were more parsimonious with less shrinkage, which resulted in a further reduction in bias (bias reduction of 89%). Conclusions: The collaborative-controlled outcome-adaptive lasso with a relaxed fit consistently performed best in terms of reducing measured confounding and regularization bias in simulations. This approach may be promising for improved bias reduction in ultra-highdimensional data with rare outcomes.",0.0,,False

642,"Background: In a recent review evaluating the quality of reporting of exposure in Pharmacoepidemiological studies, biases have been found in algorithms developed for identifying therapeutic switching and addons in secondary data sources. Objectives: (1) To develop a new algorithm for identifying switches and add-ons in secondary data sources that overcomes the limitations identified in other algorithms; (2) To test the algorithm on antiseizure medication users aged 65 or older during their first 2 years of treatment after developing epilepsy (new user design). Methods: Antiseizure medication users aged 65 or older were identified in Danish registers between 1996 and 2018. For each individual and separately for each antiseizure medication, the algorithm assessed the start and the end of each redeemed prescription of antiseizure medications (medication events) during the follow-up period. After, it calculated co-exposure time as the number of days from the first day of overlapping of medications events of different antiseizure medications (i.e., different ATC codes) to the last day in treatment or the end of the follow-up whichever came first and accounting for censoring. ICD codes of epilepsy diagnosis, duration of epilepsy hospitalization, duration of medication events, the year of inclusion in the cohort, the direction of the switch/add-on, and time to the first co-exposure were also considered by the algorithm, including pharmacological considerations on which combinations of antiseizure medications can be combined based on recommendations from clinical guidelines and expert consensus.

However, obesity weight status, as measured by body mass index (BMI), is often unavailable or under-recorded in administrative claims data. Objectives: To develop and validate a claims-based algorithm that classifies patients into obesity categories defined by BMI. Methods: Using Medicare claims data linked to two multi-center electronic health records (EHR) systems in Massachusetts, United States, we identified a cohort of patients with an available BMI measurement (measurement date ,"" cohort entry date [CED]) in the EHR dataset. Patients were required to have Medicare enrollment 90 days prior and 90 days after the CED. Patients were excluded if they had missing information on age or gender, or a previous bariatric surgery procedure, limb amputation or any cancer. A prediction model was constructed using the EHR system 1 (training set) and validated using EHR system 2 (validation set). We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to select predictors from 137 pre-specified variables. The predicted BMI based on a generalized linear model with LASSO-selected variables was used to classify patients with BMI  25, BMI  30, and BMI  40. Results: The study cohort contained 145 948 patients (mean age 74; female 61%). The final model comprised 97 variables.

Understanding WD progression over time will facilitate design of clinical trials and personalized medicine approaches. Objectives: To identify predictors for WD progression from time of diagnosis to cirrhosis, liver failure, and death (all-cause) and to predict patient-level risk of progression to these endpoints at 1, 3, and 5 years after WD diagnosis. Methods: A retrospective natural history cohort study of adult patients with incident WD diagnosis (first recorded in the study period and no WD diagnosis in the preceding year) was conducted using the US Optum EHR data between 1/1/2007 and 6/30/2020. LASSO Cox regression, Random Survival Forest (RSF), and XGBoosting (XGB) models were used to identify important predictors associated with progression to cirrhosis, liver failure, and death. An ensemble method used weighted averages to rank predictors across models and find the strongest predictors for each outcome. The resulting predictors were reviewed by clinical experts for biological plausibility. RSF and XGB models were developed for patient-level prediction using the top ensemble predictors (<15 predictors). The resulting models were validated with an independent sample cohort. C-index and dynamic AUCs were used to evaluate model performance. Results: In a total of 3559 patients with WD, 310 developed cirrhosis, 255 developed liver failure, and 604 died during the study period. Increased age at WD diagnosis, history of alcoholism, elevated AST and bilirubin levels within 3 months of WD diagnosis, and presence of both neurologic and hepatic comorbid conditions were the most common predictors for progression to the study endpoints. XGB had superior predictive performance compared with RSF by C-index (cirrhosis: 0.73 for XGB vs 0.71 for RSF; liver failure: 0.78 for XGB vs 0.77 for RSF; death: 0.80 for both XGB and RSF).

Methods: Using Danish medical databases, we conducted a nationwide cohort study of cancer patients treated with a preselected agent between 2004 and 2018. Cancer patients were followed from therapy initiation date until VTE diagnosis, death, emigration, one year of follow-up, or December 31, 2018, whichever came first. Cumulative incidence of VTE was computed using competing-risk analysis. Relative risk of VTE was evaluated in a matched case-control design, assessing exposure to targeted treatments within 3 months before VTE. VTE-free controls were matched (4:1) on age, sex, calendar year, and year of cancer diagnosis. Odds ratios (ORs) as a measure of relative risk and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were controlled for matching variables by study design and adjusted for cancer stage at diagnosis, comorbidities, and time from cancer diagnosis to index date using conditional logistic regression.

Low-dose chlorprothixene use was also associated with increased risk of MACE (ITTHR: 1.12; CI: 1.04-1.21; APC 11%), and stroke (ITT-HR: 1.21; CI: 1.06-1.37), and possibly with myocardial infarction (ITT-HR: 1.11; CI: 0.95-1.30), but not with death from cardiovascular causes (ITT-HR: 1.07; CI: 0.96-1.20). These associations were not seen in AT-analyzes. Cumulative dose of chlorprothixene 6000mg was associated with increased risk of diabetes (OR 1.15-1.63; test for trend p < 0.001), whereas a cumulative dose of chlorprothixene 1500mg was associated with increased risk of MACE (OR 1.10-1.85; test for trend p < 0.001).

However, when we only considered the first episode of AD use, the proportion still in treatment after 12 months was 33% in Sweden, 25% in Norway and 30% in Denmark. Swedish youths were more likely to have a concurrent use of other psychotropics (57%) compared to Norwegian (37%) and Danish (27%) youths. Concurrent drug use was more common for boys than girls in Denmark and Norway, whereas there was no sex difference in Swedish youths >9 years. ADs were mainly prescribed by specialists, however with variation over time. From 2013-2017, general practitioners were more likely to initiate antidepressant treatment in Norway (29%) and Denmark (25%) compared to Sweden (15%). Conclusions: The incidence of AD use varied across Scandinavia and was highest in Swedish adolescent girls. Swedish AD users were characterized by more concurrent psychotropic drug use and used antidepressants for a longer time when disregarding treatment breaks compared to Danish and Norwegian peers. Future studies should examine how predictors of AD use differ between countries.",0.0,,False

737,"Background: Timely recognition and appropriate treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are essential to enhance long-term outcomes of individuals with ADHD. Objectives: To evaluate the multinational trends and patterns of ADHD medication consumption. Methods: In this longitudinal trend study, we used pharmaceutical sales data of ADHD medication from the IQVIA-Multinational Integrated Data Analysis System (IQVIA-MIDAS) between 2015 and 2019, covering 64 countries across the world. ADHD medication included amphetamines, methylphenidate, atomoxetine, clonidine, and guanfacine. Consumption rates of ADHD medications were expressed as defined daily dose per 1000 child and adolescent inhabitants (aged 5-19) per day (DDD/TID). Linear mixed models were used to estimate the multinational, regional, and income level trend changes. We further explored the relationship between ADHD medication consumption and country's income, ADHD prevalence, and geographical location in multivariable linear regression analyzes. Results: The results showed that multinational ADHD medication consumption increased by +9.74% (95% CI, +6.28%, +13.33%) per year, from 1.20 DDD/TID in 2015 to 1.45 DDD/TID in 2019 across the 64 countries within 13 geographical regions with marked differences between countries and regions. When stratified by countries' income levels, increases in ADHD medication consumption was only observed in high-income countries but not in lower income countries. The greatest multinational increase over time was seen for amphetamine salts and guanfacine, with an average increase per year of +30.21% and +58.91% respectively. In 2019, the pooled consumption rates of ADHD medication were 6.49 DDD/TID (95% CI, 4.48, and 9.42) in high-income countries, 0.36 DDD/TID (95% CI, 0.23, and 0.58) in upper-middle-income countries, and 0.02 DDD/TID (95% CI, 0.01, and 0.05) in lower-middle-income countries. Multinational ADHD medication consumption was positively associated with gross domestic product per capita (p < 0.001) but not associated with ADHD prevalence (p , 0.21) and geographical region (p ,"" 0.35). Conclusions: Given that, the global prevalence estimates of ADHD are much higher than the ADHD medication consumption in most lower income countries, there is an urgent need to evaluate the diagnostic situations of ADHD and potential barriers to ADHD medication access in these countries to minimize the risk of negative outcomes in individuals with ADHD.""",1.0,positive,True

741,"Background: New therapeutic options such as lisdexamfetamine and guanfacine have recently become available for treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Objectives: We described contemporary patterns of ADHD medicine use among children, adolescents, and adults in Australia. Methods: This population-based study used dispensing data for a 10% random sample of Australian residents between July 2012 and December 2020. We estimated the annual prevalence and incidence of ADHD medicines, second-line guanfacine use, and examined concurrent medicine use of both stimulant and non-stimulants. We followed incident users for up to 5 years and analyzed treatment persistence using a novel proportion of people covered method. Analyzes were stratified by ADHD medicine, sex, and age group; young children (0-5 years), children (6-12 years), adolescents (13-17 years), young adults (18-24 years), and adults (25 years). Results: We observed a two-fold increase in the overall prevalence of ADHD medicine use between 2013 and 2020, from 4.9 to 9.7 per 1000 persons. Incident use also increased across all age groups and both sexes, with most pronounced increases among adolescent females (from 1.4 to 5.3 per 1000 persons). Stimulant treatment persistence after 5 years was highest among those initiating treatment as young children (64%) and children (69%) and lowest among those initiating treatment in adolescence (19%). Concurrent use of stimulants and non-stimulants was more common among males and younger age groups. Most children (87%) initiating guanfacine had prior dispensings of ADHD medicines. Conclusions: We observed increasing ADHD medicine use in Australia, especially among young females. Nevertheless, treatment rates remained lower than the estimated prevalence of ADHD across all subpopulations. Poor long-term treatment persistence in adolescence may warrant improved clinical monitoring of ADHD in patients transitioning from pediatric to adult care. Reassuringly, use of newly approved guanfacine appeared to be in accordance with guidelines among children.",1.0,clinical,True

An overview of the medicines used in people who die from suicide gives us an indication of the mental health conditions that are being pharmacologically treated, and not treated, at time of death. Objectives: To provide an overview of the psychotropic medicines used at the time of death from suicide, using both dispensing data and forensic toxicological data. Methods: This was a population-based case series study of all suicide deaths in Australia (2013-2019). To rule out medicine utilization confounded by means of suicide (i.e., overdose), only cases where medicines were not considered by the coroner as a contributor to death were included. National coronial data, including all drugs detected during forensic examination, were linked with prior medicine dispensing data from the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Medicines whose derived estimated period of exposure (EPE) overlapped with the date of death were examined and categorized. We calculated the number and proportion of suicide deaths with and without any current pharmacological treatment, overall and by medicine type. In addition, we determined the most common medicine combinations used in the sample. Results: The sample comprised 12247 suicide decedents. Almost half of the sample (45.8%, n ,"" 5612) were not dispensed any medicines (either psychotropic or non-psychotropic) whose EPE overlapped with the date of death, however 14.3% (n "","" 800) of those did have an antidepressant, anxiolytic or antipsychotic detected at autopsy. Nervous system medicines were the most common dispensed in the sample (42.6%, n "", 5220) with antidepressants the most common class dispensed to 31.2% (n ,"" 3824) of the sample, followed by anxiolytics (11.4%, n "","" 1401), antipsychotics (10.9%, n "","" 1341) and opioids (8.7%, n "","" 1060).

Conclusions: The medicine use detected in our study has shed some light on the pharmacological treatment of mental health conditions at time of death from suicide, and there are significant advantages of using both dispensing and coronial data to get a deeper understanding. While nervous system medicines were the most common, they are only used in a little over half of the sample.

748,"Background: Patients with cancer are at-risk of psychological distress, sleep disturbances, and psychiatric disorders. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed to address the related symptoms. Little is known about the local prescribing practices for these medications among Chinese patients with cancer. Objectives: To examine the prevalence and factors associated with the prescriptions of psychotropic medications after cancer diagnoses using a population-based electronic health database in Hong Kong. Methods: The cohort consists of around 200 000 patients randomly selected from the patient populations who utilized the public healthcare services managed by the Hospital Authority in 2007 and 2017. Eligible patients included those who had a cancer diagnosis (ICD code C0099), did not have any pre-existing mental, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental disorders (ICD code F00-99) or were not prescribed psychotropic medications prior to cancer diagnoses. The study focused on the prevalence of newly prescribed hypnotics, anxiolytic, antipsychotics, antidepressants, CNS stimulants, and drugs for substance abuse (BNF code 4.1-4.4, 4.10) after cancer diagnoses. Logistic regression was used to explore the factors associated with psychotropic medication use, adjusting for age and sex. (SAS® Viya® for analysis) Results: Among 10 022 eligible patients (Female: 51.8%; mean age at cancer diagnosis , 63.6 [SD ,"" 15.8 years]), 1997 patients (19.8%) were newly prescribed with psychotropic medications after cancer diagnoses.

756,"Background: Antidepressant adherence patterns are variable and may be affected by substance use disorders (SUDs). Few studies use timevarying methods to address the association between SUD and variable patterns of antidepressant treatment adherence. Objectives: To identify the association between SUD and antidepressant adherence trajectory subgroups. Methods: A new user cohort of US adults 18-64 years-old was derived from a 10% sample of IQVIA PharMetrics Plus for Academics commercial claims database. New users had at least 1 antidepressant anytime 01/2007 through 06/2020 with no evidence of use in the prior 6 months (i.e., baseline). The date of first prescription claim was the index date. Inclusion criteria were: (1) evidence of a depression diagnosis at the index date or in the prior 6 months and (2) continuous medical and prescription benefits in the 6 months before and after the index date. Group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) identified antidepressant adherence subgroups. The model incorporated a biweekly continuous outcome measure--the proportion of days covered (PDC)--over a 6-month period after the index date (i.e., followup) and a censored normal distribution for the outcome. Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and log Bayes Factor were used to select the number of trajectory subgroups. We used multinomial logistic regression to compare baseline demographics (e.g., age, sex) and clinical covariates (e.g., SUD, mental health) across trajectory subgroups. Results: Among the 82 408 new antidepressant users, 5 adherence trajectories emerged: (1) early decline (n ,"" 17 471; 21%), (2) delayed decline (n "","" 11 124; 14%), (3) gradual decline (n "","" 8819; 11%), (4) decline-to-increase (n "","" 9029; 11%), and (5) persistent high (n "","" 35 965; 44%). Mean PDC during follow-up varied from 16%- 89% across trajectory subgroups. Compared to persistent high, those in the early decline group were more likely to be younger and less likely to have a major depressive disorder diagnosis or use psychotherapy. Early decline, delayed decline, and decline-to-increase had a higher proportion of adults with SUD relative to the other groups. SUD was significantly associated with all groups (early decline [OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.5, 1.7], delayed decline [OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.4, 1.6], gradual decline [OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.3, 1.5]) and decline-to-increase [OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.4, 1.6] relative to the persistent high group. Conclusions: Groups that demonstrated a decline in antidepressant adherence had a 40%-60% greater odds of including individuals with SUD. Efforts to improve antidepressant adherence should address coexisting SUD.""",1.0,clinical,True

Objectives: We conducted a real-world comparative effectiveness study to assess the safety and effectiveness of DOAC vs. warfarin among nursing home residents with NVAF. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used Minimum Data Set linked to Medicare claims from 2011 to 2018 and included residents of nursing homes with diagnoses of NVAF who newly initiated DOAC or warfarin. We evaluated three outcomes: time to stroke or systemic embolism, time to major bleeding, and time to all-cause death. In addition, we used time to pneumonia as a negative control outcome to evaluate the role of unmeasured confounding. We used sociodemographic factors, CHA2DS2-VASc score, HAS-BLED score, comorbidities, comedications, cognitive status, activities of daily living, and other psychosocial measures to calculate inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW). We used IPTW weighted competing risk regression for stroke/ systemic embolism, major bleeding, and pneumonia. We used IPTW weighted Cox proportional hazard regression for all-cause death. Results: Among 38 983 residents included in the study, 19 366 (49.7%) initiated DOACs and 19 617 (50.3%) warfarin. In the IPTW analysis, compared to warfarin, DOAC use was associated with less stroke/ systemic embolism (4.50 vs. 4.71 events per 100 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.89, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.81-0.99). We found no significant difference between DOAC and warfarin for major bleeding (12.6 vs. 12.4 events per 100 person-years; aHR 0.98, CI 0.92-1.04) and all-cause death (48.1 vs. 49.0 events per 100 personyears; IPTW analysis aHR 0.98, CI 0.95-1.01). There was no significant difference between DOAC and warfarin for the risk of pneumonia (aHR 0.96, CI 0.91-1.01), indicating little or no unmeasured confounding. Conclusions: Among nursing home residents with NVAF, the use of DOAC was associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism without an increased risk of major bleeding or allcause death.

Methods: Using administrative claims data from US Medicare and two commercial health insurance databases (January 2010-March 2021), we conducted a cohort study of patients who were hospitalized for VTE and initiated an oral anticoagulant (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin) within 30 days of VTE discharge. Patients were required to have at least 365 days of health plan enrollment prior to VTE with no exposure to any oral anticoagulant during that period. We further required study patients to complete at least (1) 90, (2) 180, (3) 270, or (4) 360 days of continuous anticoagulation. Among patients who completed the specified initial treatment, we compared those who continued anticoagulation further with patients who discontinued treatment. Primary outcomes included VTE recurrence and hospitalization with major bleeding. Propensity score matching weights were used to adjust for confounding. Follow-up began the day after completion of initial treatment, and patients were censored on change of therapy in the primary analysis. A weighted Cox model was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% robust confidence intervals (CIs). Results: We identified 90 921 eligible patients who completed 90 days; 52 892 who completed 180 days; 26 428 who completed 270 days; and 8363 who completed 360 days of anticoagulation. Patients who completed at least 90 days were, on average, 70 years old with 57% female. Anticoagulant continuation was associated with a lower risk of recurrent VTE relative to discontinuation, with HRs ranging from 0.30 (95% CI 0.25-0.35) for therapy beyond 90 days to 0.15 (95% CI 0.08-0.26) for therapy beyond 360 days. There were no major differences in the risk of bleeding for continuation versus discontinuation with HRs from 1.16 (95% CI 0.99-1.37) for therapy beyond 90 days to 0.91 (95% CI 0.52-1.61) for therapy beyond 360 days.

Health technology assessment (HTA) agencies such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have therefore relied on indirect comparisons with warfarin, which have been limited by trial heterogeneity. Objectives: To estimate the incidence of stroke and safety outcomes among patients with non-valvular AF initiating apixaban compared to rivaroxaban using RWD. Methods: Using anonymized patient data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN®) UK primary care database, we identified adults (18 years) with non-valvular AF newly initiating apixaban or rivaroxaban between 7/2014 and 12/2020. Patients were required to be naive to study outcomes and other risk factors. Our primary outcome was stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), and safety outcomes included all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), transient ischemic attack (TIA), major bleeding events (MBE), and a composite endpoint of angina/MI/stroke (AMS). We used 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching to balance treatment groups, and high-dimensional PS (hdPS) matching in sensitivity analyzes of all outcomes. Patients were followed from the day after treatment initiation until outcome, death, end of patient registration, or end of study period. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) using Cox regression and conducted subgroup analyzes by age, concomitant aspirin and prior warfarin use, diabetes, heart failure, and CHA2DS2-VASc score. Results: We identified 1839 PS-matched pairs of patients initiating apixaban or rivaroxaban. Compared with rivaroxaban, patients initiating apixaban showed similar rates of stroke (HR, 95% CI: 0.93, 0.64- 1.34), all-cause mortality (1.03, 0.87-1.22), MI (0.95, 0.54-1.68), TIA (1.03, 0.61-1.72), and AMS (0.96, 0.72-1.27), and lower rates of MBE (0.60, 0.47-0.75). In subgroup analyzes, effects on stroke were heterogeneous by history of warfarin use (with: 0.69, 0.241.98; without: 1.19, 0.77-1.85), noting limited power. hdPS-matched results were similar across outcomes. Conclusions: Among patients with non-valvular AF, apixaban was as effective as rivaroxaban in reducing rate of stroke and safer in terms of MBE.

777,"Background: Individuals hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Based on limited evidence, current guidelines recommend that all individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 receive prophylactic anticoagulation. Objectives: To evaluate safety and effectiveness of prophylactic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in individuals hospitalized for COVID-19, compared to those not receiving anticoagulation. Methods: Using healthcare records from the capital region of Denmark (March 2020-February 2021) and Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden (February 2020-September 2021), we conducted an observational cohort study among individuals hospitalized for COVID-19. We compared clinical outcomes 30 days after admission in individuals who received prophylactic LMWH during the first 48 h of hospitalization with outcomes among those not receiving prophylactic anticoagulation. We used inverse probability weighting to adjust for confounders and bias due to missing information. Risk ratios, risk differences, and robust 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using binomial regression. Country-specific risk ratios were pooled using a random-effects model and the DerSimonian-Laird estimator. Results: We included 1692 and 1868 individuals in the Danish and Swedish cohorts. Of these, 771 (46%) and 1167 (63%) received prophylactic LMWH up to 48 h after admission. The combined mortality in Denmark and Sweden was 12% (N ,"" 432) and the pooled risk ratio was 0.91 (CI 0.60-1.38) comparing individuals who received LMWH to those who did not. The relative risk of ICU admission was 1.12 (CI 0.76-1.66), while we observed no increased risk of bleeding (RR 0.63, 0.13-2.94). The relative risk of VTE was 0.80 (0.43-1.47). Conclusions: We found no benefit on mortality with prophylactic LMWH and no increased risk of bleeding among COVID-19 patients receiving prophylactic LMWH.""",1.0,coronavirus,True

Methods: We used data from a validated cohort of new users of DOACs from BIFAP database aged 18 years within the study period Jan 2008-Dec 2015, with at least 1 years' registration with the primary care practitioner (PCP). We followed up patients from the first DOAC prescription date up to the occurrence of IS and conducted a nested control analysis using conditional logistic regression. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for discontinuation DOACs (past use (those stopping treatment between 31 and 180 days) compared with current use (those with use within the 7 days up to index date). Past users were subdivided as stopping treatment within months 3 and 2 prior to index and between months 6 and 3 before index date. Also, as a sensitivity analysis, the effect of naïve current users against IS onset was evaluated compared with non-naïve current users. Results: DOACs´ discontinuation for 1 to 6 months showed an OR of IS of 2.21 (95% CI: 1.563.13), corresponding estimates for individual DOACs were: 1.98 (95% CI: 1.25-3.12) for apixaban, 1.98 (95% CI: 1.24-2.65) for dabigatran, 2.13 (95% CI: 1.34-3.39) for rivaroxaban and 1.38 (95% CI: 0.40-4.72) for edoxaban. When subdividing the past users, we observed how the risk cumulated closer to the index date (corresponding estimates 2.51 (95% CI: 1.843.42) and 1.43 (95% CI: 0.96- 2.13) for stopping within months 3 and 1 prior to index or between months 6 and 3 before).

Patients redeeming a prescription for a high-intensity or low- or moderate-intensity statin within 21 days after the admission were identified. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance patient characteristics between cohorts. We used competing risk methods to compute 5-year risk differences (RDs) and Cox regression to compute hazard ratios (HRs) of stroke recurrence, myocardial infarction, heart failure, venous thromboembolism, peripheral artery disease, and all-cause mortality (effectiveness outcomes) and diabetes, cancer, liver disease, and kidney disease (safety outcomes). Results: High (n , 5770) and low- or moderate (n ,"" 12 052) intensity statin initiators were identified. Risks of most examined effectiveness outcomes were comparable between statin groups. For example, the 5-year RDs and HRs, comparing high- with low- or moderate-intensity, were 1.3% (95% Confidence intervals: 0.3, 2.2) and 1.14 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.38) for stroke recurrence and 0.3% (95% CI: À0.1, 0.8) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.70, 1.66) for myocardial infarction. A noticeable exception was all-cause mortality, which was reduced (RD: À2.9% [95% CI: À4.4, À1.5], HR: 0.83 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.97]).

792,"Background: Regulatory advisories on hydroxysine and risk of QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes (TdP) were issued in the UK in April 2015 and Canada in June 2016. Advisories highlighted that patients with risk factors for QT prolongation and TdP, such as underlying heart conditions and concomitant use of QT-prolonging drugs, were at higher risk of these adverse events. Objectives: To determine whether patient risk factors for QT prolongation and TdP modified the effect of hydroxysine advisories on hydroxysine initiation in the UK and British Columbia (BC), Canada. We hypothesized patients with risk factors for QT prolongation and TdP, compared to those without risk factors, would be less likely to initiate hydroxysine in the UK and in British Columbia (BC), Canada, following advisories. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study with repeated measures. We evaluated hydroxysine initiation among patients who had recently visited a physician for contact dermatitis and other eczema, rash, urticaria, allergy, pruritus, atopic dermatitis, or scabies. Study cohorts included a UK cohort and a concurrent BC control cohort (April 2013-March 2016) and a BC advisory cohort (June 2014-May 2017). Results: The study included 247 665 patients in the UK cohort, 297 147 patients in the BC control cohort, and 303 653 patients in the BC advisory cohort. Over a 12-month post-advisory period, hydroxysine initiation decreased by 21% in the UK (rate ratio 0.79; 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.96) relative to the expected level of initiation based on the pre-advisory trend. Hydroxysine initiation did not change in the BC control cohort or following the Canadian advisory in the BC advisory cohort. Our analysis of hydroxysine initiation in the UK in the 12 months after the advisories indicated a lack of statistically significant effect modification for underlying heart conditions (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.70-1.07) and recent use of QT-prolonging drugs with known risk of TdP (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.63-1.07), as well as for other risk factors for QT prolongation and TdP. Conclusions: Hydroxysine initiation decreased in the UK, but not in BC, in the 12 months following safety advisories.

The comparative risk of TTS and thromboembolism (TE) following vaccination with different COVID-19 vaccines remains unclear. Objectives: To quantify the comparative risk of TTS or TE associated with vaccination with adenovirus-based or mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: An international network cohort study using routinely collected data from the UK, Spain, Germany, France, Netherlands, and the US was conducted. We included individuals who received at least on dose of Vaxzevria, Comirnaty, Spikevax, or Janssen COVID-19 vaccines. Cohorts of first and second doses users were defined by vaccine brands in each database. The index date was the date of vaccination. Outcomes of interest were TTS or TE during 28 days following vaccination, defined by clinical codes and measurements based on the Brighton collaboration definition. Large-scale propensity score matching was used to control for observed confounding, and negative control outcomes to assess unobserved confounding. Empirical calibration was used to adjust for systematic error, and calibrated incidence rate ratios (cIRR) estimated to quantify risk of developing TTS or TE according to vaccination with adenovirus-based (Vaxzevria or Janssen COVID-19) versus mRNA vaccines (Comirnaty/Spikevax) using Poisson models. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool results across databases. Results: We identified 4.0 million people vaccinated with a first dose of Vaxzevria, and 1.6 million people vaccinated with a second dose from all participating databases. We identified 1.1 million people vaccinated with single-dose Janssen COVID-19 vaccine in three databases. We identified 10.6 million people vaccinated with a first dose of Comirnaty, and 7.7 million people vaccinated with a second dose. We identified 4.3 million people vaccinated with a first dose of Spikevax, and 3 million people vaccinated with a second dose. Comparing Vaxzevria to first-dose Comirnaty, we observed an increased risk of thrombocytopenia (pooled calibrated IRR 1.33 [1.18-1.50]) and TTS (pooled calibrated IRR 1.29 [0.94-1.77]). Risk of TTS with venous thromboembolism was higher in Janssen versus Comirnaty 1-dose vaccines: pooled calibrated IRR 2.26 [0.93-5.52]. Conclusions: We observed a 30% increased risk of thrombocytopenia and TTS after first-dose Vaxzevria versus first-dose Comirnaty vaccination. We also identified an increased risk of TTS with venous thrombo-embolism after single-dose Janssen versus Comirnaty.

Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the time needed for finalized aRMM evaluations with Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) conclusions for medicines licensed via the central authorization procedure in the EU. Methods: A cohort that included medicines authorized through the EU centralized procedure between January 2005 and December 2017 was established using the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) database of the European Medicines Agency. Generic, biosimilar and duplicate applications were excluded. Data on the presence of aRMMs at marketing authorization (MA) was extracted from the EPARs. For aRMMs implemented at MA, we were able to identify finalized evaluations between January 2017 and April 2021 using the PRAC minutes. Data on the time needed for the evaluation process was collected using clinical study reports and regulatory assessment reports via the Medicines Evaluation Board. The overall time as well as three consecutive time periods were calculated: aRMM implementation to start evaluation study, the evaluation study and assessment by PRAC. Results: aRMMs were identified for 157 of the 615 (26%) medicines authorized between 2005 and 2017. Between 2017 and April 2021, 23 finalized aRMM evaluations of 21 unique medicines were identified, of which seven were authorized before 2012. The median time needed to complete the aRMM evaluation process was 5.3 years (IQR: 4.5-7.2). Specifically, the median time between aRMM implementation and start of data collection was 2.3 years (IQR: 1.6-5.0). Furthermore, the median duration of an aRMM evaluation study was 2.1 years (IQR: 1.5-2.8). More than half of the studies (n ,"" 13, 57%) were delayed for at least three months, mostly due to participant recruitment issues. Lastly, the median time needed for regulatory assessment by PRAC was 5.5 months (IQR: 2.1-7.0). Conclusions: Approximately a quarter of the medicines authorized between 2005 and 2017 had aRMM(s) in place at time of MA. The time needed to complete the aRMM evaluation process for medicines authorized through the centralized procedure was about 5 years. Therefore, the feasibility of the draft GVP Module XVI rev 3 advice to measure effectiveness of aRMM at first 12 to 18 months after implementation has yet to be proven.""",1.0,clinical,True

Objectives: To Identify, baseline patient characteristics that may act as effect modifiers for biologics used for the treatment of psoriasis and their survival. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study using data from the British Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register (BADBIR), a large, ongoing pharmacovigilance registry of psoriasis patients in the UK and RoI, between November 2007 and August 2021. We fitted a flexible parametric survival model for drug survival; limited the outcome to discontinuation due to ineffectiveness; and allowed for time-varying effects. We included covariates that were previously known to be associated with biologic survival, and investigated for potential effect modification by categorical covariates between biologic and their survival. Results: 6607 (41.0%) patients started on adalimumab, 5405 (33.5%) ustekinumab, 2677 (16.6%) secukinumab, 730 (4.5%) guselkumab, and 703 (4.4%) on ixekizumab. People with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or nail involvement had a lower drug survival than those without PsA or nail involvement for ustekinumab only (hazard ratio [HR] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.35).

823,"Background: Vedolizumab, an integrin receptor antagonist (IRA), is indicated for the immune-mediated disorder inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients with immune disorders are at risk of acute complications such as acute pancreatitis. Pancreatitis has been reported with vedolizumab, however, it is unclear whether the signal is due to vedolizumab or an independent risk of the condition in patients with IBD. Objectives: To investigate whether vedolizumab is associated with pancreatitis using a systems biology approach in spontaneous reports data. Methods: The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database was used to undertake a disproportionality analysis of pancreatitis adverse event reports (2015-2020). Using a systems biology approach, we compared the proportion of pancreatitis reports with vedolizumab as primary suspect, with reports for (1) all other medicines, (2) other medicines with the same structural properties (monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)), (3) similar pharmacological mechanism (other IRAs) and (4) medicines for the same indication (Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC)). Disproportionality was assessed using the Information Component (IC) from Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Networks (reported on the ratio scale as 2^IC). A signal was identified where 2^IC > 2 and the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) lower bound >1. Results: No signal was identified for pancreatitis with vedolizumab compared to: all other medicines (2^IC 1.96, 95% CI 1.6-2.3), other IRAs (2^IC 1.75, 95% CI 1.6-1.9), restricting to CD (2^IC 1.0, 95% CI 0.7-1.3) or UC (2^IC 1.2, 95% CI 0.9-1.5). A signal was found when compared to reports for all other mAbs (2^IC 2.2, 95% CI 1.9-2.6). Conclusions: This analysis suggests that vedolizumab is not likely to be independently associated with the risk of pancreatitis in patients with IBD. A systems biology approach can be employed to account for potential confounding by indication when investigating signals in immune-mediated disorders.",1.0,disease,True

829,"Background: Pimavanserin, a serotonin 5HT2 antagonist, is the only drug licensed in the US for treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP). In premarketing PDP trials, 11% of patients died during openlabel pimavanserin treatment. Antipsychotics increase mortality in dementia patients, but no large database study has compared mortality with pimavanserin or atypical antipsychotics (AAs), which are used off-label in PDP. Objectives: To assess the risk of mortality from any cause among Parkinson's disease (PD) patients using pimavanserin and AAs. Methods: Using data from Medicare, the US health insurance program for over 65s, we performed a retrospective new-user cohort study of PD patients initiating pimavanserin (n , 3227) or AAs (n ,"" 18 442) from April 2016 to March 2019. We addressed potential confounding through inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for allcause mortality with pimavanserin versus AAs, using segmented proportional hazards regression over 1-180 and 181+ days of treatment. We conducted pre-specified subgroup analysis by nursing home residency on index date and post-hoc analysis by anti-dementia medication use during the baseline period. Results: Pimavanserin users had a mean age of approximately 78 years and 45% were female. Neurologists initiated 72% of pimavanserin and 38% of AA. Before IPTW, some comorbidities were more prevalent in AA users; after IPTW, these were well-balanced. In the first 180 days of treatment, mortality was approximately 35% lower with pimavanserin than with AAs (HR 0Á65, 95% CI 0Á53-0Á79), with approximately one less death per 30 pimavanserin-treated patients; however, during treatment beyond 180 days, there was no additional mortality advantage with pimavanserin (HR 1Á05, 95% CI 0Á82-1Á33). The difference in mortality between pimavanserin and AA users prior to 180 days was more pronounced in patients treated with antidementia medications. Among nursing home patients, pimavanserin showed no mortality advantage during any time period (HR 1Á05, 95% CI 0Á73-1Á52 in 1-180 days, HR 1Á54, 95% CI 0Á91-2Á63 in 181+ days of treatment). Conclusions: Pimavanserin use was associated with lower mortality than AA use during the first 180 days of treatment, but only in community-dwelling residents, not nursing home residents.

832,"Background: Given treatment guidelines and options, finding effective treatments to manage rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be a challenge. Objectives: To evaluate the application of machine learning (ML) to real-world data (RWD) to identify predictors of response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) treatment among patients with RA previously naïve to biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drug(s) (bDMARD) or targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD) therapy. Methods: We used Optum® MarketClarity® data from Jan 2011-Mar 2019, which included integrated electronic health records (EHR) and claims data for >15M lives, to identify individuals diagnosed with RA receiving first line TNFi treatment. The primary outcome of ineffective TNFi response was defined using Curtis et al.'s algorithm (a validated claims-based algorithm for determining the effectiveness of TNFi medications in RA patients). Treatment was deemed to be ineffective if patients met any of the following criteria during one year of follow-up: 1. Inadequate adherence to index drug; 2. bDMARD switch or addition; 3. addition of new non-biologic DMARD; 4. increase in bDMARD dose or frequency; 5. >1 glucocorticoid joint injection; or 6. increase in dose of oral glucocorticoid. We examined 772 potential predictors drawn from claims data during the year prior to TNFi initiation. A Bayesian methodology was employed with an ensemble approach that examines a network of at least 128 predictive models. Results: A 2018 patients met our eligibility criteria (74% female, mean age 54.6 years). TNFi treatment was determined to be ineffective in 71% of patients. The main predictor of TNFi ineffectiveness was 1 ER visit (odds ratio [OR] 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77, 0.84]). Because ER visits was such a strong predictor, when 1 ER visit was removed from the model, abdominal pain became the strongest predictor of TNFi ineffectiveness (OR 0.51; 0.51, 0.67). The strongest predictor of TNFi treatment effectiveness was prior use of methotrexate (OR 1.55; 1.55, 2.04). The AUC median was 0.56 with maximum of 0.60. Conclusions: ML methods can be leveraged to address questions in Pharmacoepidemiology using RWD. Rather than a single predictive model, this ensemble modeling approach enables better sampling of the modeling space (including interactions among variables) and increases predictive power. It amplifies relationships best supported by the data and downplays spurious ones. However, even with applying ML methods to a rich EHR/claims integrated RWD source, it proved difficult to predict when first line treatment with a TNFi would be ineffective for patients with RA. Nonetheless, prior use of methotrexate increased the likelihood of TNFi effectiveness, while 1 ER visit and abdominal pain reduced the likelihood of effectiveness.",1.0,disease,True

838,"Background: Regulators communicate important information about emerging post-market safety concerns by issuing `safety advisories'. We aimed to compare the use of advisories by the Australian national regulatory authority with other regulators, for a cohort of new drugs approved in Australia. Objectives: We aimed to compare the issuing of advisories for postmarket safety concerns in Australia with that of regulators in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We examined safety advisories for new drugs approved in Australia from 2010 to 2016 for frequency and timing of post-market safety advisories; characteristics of the safety concerns; nature of advice provided; and actions taken by regulators Methods: We examined the timing, use and content of advisories issued by regulators in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, for new chemical and biological entities approved in Australia from 2010 to 2016. Advisories were coded for characteristics of the safety concerns, regulatory actions, and advice to consumers and clinicians. We carried out a content analysis examining the nature of the safety concern, the way harm was described, the evidence cited to support the concern, advice to prescribers and consumers, and regulatory actions including whether the advisory described product information changes. Severity or seriousness were assessed according to whether outcomes met the standard regulatory definition of serious adverse reactions and whether product information was changed to include a new contraindication, boxed or other warning, and/or loss of indication. Results: Of 173 new drugs approved in Australia, advisories were issued for 30% (51), with 73 different safety concerns communicated by any regulator from 2010 to 2016. Australian advisories were issued for less than a quarter of the safety concerns communicated by other regulators (20.5%-15/73); UK advisories were issued for 63% (46/73). Most (67/73-91.8%) safety concerns were serious, 39/73 (53.4%) mentioned death, and 32/73 (45.2%) led to a significant product information change such as a new contraindication or warning. Australia issued advisories for 7 of the 39 (17.9%) safety concerns for which death or fatal outcomes was mentioned by any regulator (39/73; 53.4%), and 7/33 (21.1%) of significant product information changes described by any regulator. Conclusions: Around a third of new drugs approved in Australia within a 10-year period were associated with post-market safety concerns. Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration communicated fewer of these concerns in safety advisories than the US, the UK, or Canada.

841,"Background: Appendicitis has been reported as a potential adverse event following immunization with mRNA-based vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objectives: To evaluate the risk of appendicitis following mRNA vaccination against COVID-19. Methods: Using Danish nationwide registries, we conducted a population-based cohort study of all recipients of the BNT162b2 (Comirnaty®, Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Spikevax®, Moderna) vaccine and all individuals with PCR-test confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection aged 12 years or more in Denmark until November 30, 2021. For comparison, we sampled an unvaccinated reference cohort among all Danish individuals aged 12 years or more tested for SARS-CoV-2. Individuals hospitalized with appendicitis or with a surgical procedure code of appendectomy were identified in the Danish National Patient Registry. Using propensity score derived standardized morbidity ratio weights, we estimated the risk ratio for the combined outcome of appendicitis or appendectomy 21 days after immunization against COVID-19 with the first or second dose, and 21 days after SARSCoV-2 infection, adjusted for age, sex, municipality, immigration status, history of inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and history of antibiotic prescription fills. Results: Among 4 048 883 individuals aged 12 years or more immunized with a mRNA vaccine against COVID-19, there were 330 episodes of appendicitis within 21 days of the first dose, and 340 episodes within 21 days of the second dose.

847,"Background: As of February 2022, the WHO global database of reported potential side effects of medicinal products, VigiBase, contains 3.2 million individual case reports of adverse events following COVID-19 immunization. This is more than 10% of all reports in VigiBase to date and more than 50% of all reports submitted during 2021. The reports on COVID-19 vaccines are a crucial asset in supporting their safe use. Meanwhile, this massive influx of reports increases overall relative reporting rates of some adverse events (AE), which may mask future safety signals for other medicinal products when disproportionality analysis is used to support and guide clinical review. Objectives: To identify adverse events masked by reports on COVID19 vaccines in VigiBase. Methods: The approach for simple unmasking proposed by Juhlin et al in Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety, 2013 was used to identify AEs for which the overall relative reporting rates increased by at least 50% when reports on COVID-19 vaccines were considered alongside reports on all other drugs and vaccines (data in VigiBase up to Dec 1, 2021). In this approach, statistical shrinkage is used to limit the impact of random variability and shift focus away from rare AEs. AEs in the System Organ Classes Investigations and Surgical and medical procedures were not considered. Results: 132 AEs were masked by COVID-19 vaccine reports to the extent that their overall relative reporting rates in VigiBase increased by 50% or more. A 21 of these are on the European Medicines Agency's list of Important Medical Events (IME), including: sweating fever (expected value up by 1300%), Bell's palsy (up 560%), vaccine breakthrough infection (up 680%), hemiparaesthesia (up 240%), myocarditis (up 140%), pericarditis (up 130%), COVID-19 pneumonia (up 120%), and postmenopausal hemorrhage (up 120%). Conclusions: Inclusion of COVID-19 vaccine reports in disproportionality analysis for other medicinal products may hinder or delay the detection of statistical signals of many AEs, including IMEs that are of special interest in pharmacovigilance. An increase by 50% in the overall relative reporting rate of an AE increasing the expected count, from 10 to 15, would require 30 reports instead of 18 to detect a statistical signal. Strategies to mitigate this need to be developed and evaluated for example to exclude reports of COVID-19 vaccines from disproportionality analysis for other medicinal products or to apply a method for unmasking.",1.0,case,True

850,"Background: In late 2021, we observed that zero records in the IBM® MarketScan® Research Databases had an ICD-10-CM code for COVID-19 (U07.1 ""COVID-19, virus identified"") as either a principal diagnosis or in the first diagnosis code position on inpatient claims. Given the significant morbidity and mortality related to the pandemic, it is highly unlikely that there were no COVID-related hospitalizations among >40 million persons in one year. The missingness for this code has been identified as a third-party software anomaly, but a full correction is estimated to take months or years. Objectives: Considering the potential of these data to answer questions related to COVID-19, we sought to identify alternative approaches for capturing COVID-related admissions in MarketScan. Methods: We defined persons of any age as having a COVID-related inpatient stay in MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Care Databases from April 2020 through June 2021 in three ways. First, an inpatient encounter with a second position diagnosis of U07.1. Second, an inpatient encounter with a principal diagnosis of ICD-10-CM B97.29 (""Other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere""). Third, an inpatient encounter with both a principal diagnosis of B97.29 and U07.1 in any other position. To benchmark the validity, we compared the proportion of total inpatient encounters related to COVID-19 in MarketScan to three other administrative claims databases from commercial insurance sources: PINC AITM Healthcare Data (PHD) Special Release COVID-19 edition, IQVIA PharMetrics® Plus and Optum Clinformatics® Data Mart. Results: Among a total of 1 467 411 inpatient encounters, there were 63 367 with a second position diagnosis of U07.1, 61 884 had a principal diagnosis of B97.29, and 61 879 had both a principal diagnosis of B97.29 and U07.1 in any other position; these groups are not mutually exclusive. There were clear temporal patterns that mirrored national pandemic trends, with a rise in cases during Summer 2020, followed by a dramatic rise in Fall 2020/Winter 2021. The proportion of inpatient encounters classified as COVID-related was similar for each strategy considered, and closely resembled monthly trends in other datasets. For example, in July 2020, we identified 3.8% of admissions as COVIDrelated using each MarketScan search strategy, as compared to 4.4% in PHD, 4.1% in PharMetrics and 5.6% in Clinformatics Data Mart. Conclusions: A stricter definition may consider a principal diagnosis of B97.29 with U07.1 in any diagnosis position; a broader definition would use U07.1 in any position.

Objectives: To examine the uptake of the new diagnosis code and describe concurrently diagnosed conditions to understand how the code is being used in routine clinical practice. Methods: We identified patients with an ICD-10-CM code for post COVID-10 condition between October 1, 2021 and January 31, 2022 from de-identified claims in Health Verity's Real-Time Insights and Evidence database. The index date was the first post COVID-19 diagnosis date. To identify a prior COVID diagnosis, we required 3-months of continuous enrollment (CE) before the post COVID-19 diagnosis date. Demographic and clinical variables were summarized with descriptive statistics. The frequency of concurrent diagnosis codes was evaluated on the index date. We also assessed the most common diagnoses codes within the 30 days prior to the index post COVID-19 condition code. Results: There were 56 143 patients with a post COVID-19 diagnosis code, with cases increasing in mid-December following the trajectory of the omicron case wave by 3-4 weeks. The analysis cohort included 12 622 subjects that remained after the 3-month pre-index CE criteria was applied. Among this cohort, the median age was 49 years; however, 8.6% were pediatric patients. The post COVID-19 code was more common among females (61%) and was used most often in the outpatient setting, although 14% of older adults were inpatient. Only 70.4% had a documented COVID diagnosis code (53% among children) and the median time between the COVID and post-COVID diagnosis code was 56 days. The most common concurrently coded conditions varied by age - children commonly experienced COVIDlike symptoms (e.g., cough, breathing abnormalities), while respiratory failure and pneumonia were more common among adults 65 years. Conclusions: The post COVID-19 ICD-10-CM diagnosis code is being used to identify patients with continuing illness following the acute phase of disease in patients of all ages in the United States. The use of the post COVID-19 code encompasses a wide range of conditions. Widespread use of this code for research is limited until a standard definition of post COVID-19 is agreed upon by the medical and public health community.

Incident drug use was defined as the first prescription filled within the specific drug class during the last five years. We calculated overall incidence rates (IR) of psychotropic drug use per month by age group and the total dispensed drug quantity (in Defined Daily Doses (DDD)) per month overall and by drug class. We calculated the proportion of users naïve to all other psychotropic drug classes 180 days prior to their incident prescription from March 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022. Using an interrupted time series approach we modeled the monthly number of incident users of psychotropic drugs, stratified by drug class and age group before the COVID-19 pandemic using Poisson regression and modeling seasonality using Fourier terms. Results: There was an increase in incident use of psychotropics among all age groups from the first Danish lockdown in March 2020 through March 2022. This was most prominent among 12-17-yearsolds (IR from 165 to 278/100 000 inhabitants) and 18-24-years-olds (IR from 323 to 516/100 000). Adjusting for pre-pandemic time trends, this corresponded to a relative increase of 32% (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.31-1.34) and 17% (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.16-1.18) from expected numbers. The increase exceeded expected numbers for all drugs except anxiolytics, with rate ratios of 1.37 (CI 1.36-1.38) for hypnotics and sedatives, 1.17 (CI 1.15-1.18) for psychostimulants, 1.11 (CI 1.09-1.12) for antidepressants and 1.08 (CI 1.06-1.10) for antipsychotics. The increase in incident use was also reflected in the total dispensed quantity of psychotropic drugs, but only for hypnotics and sedatives (0.5 to 1.0 million (m) DDD per month), antidepressants (0.9 to 1.2 m DDD) and psychostimulants (0.9 to 1.1 m DDD). Of all new users, 65% were naïve to other psychotropic drug classes 180 days prior to initiation. Conclusions: Danish youths have experienced an increase in mental problems that required psychotropic treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. These new young users likely need psychiatric care and treatment in the future, emphasizing a potential strain on healthcare systems that reach beyond the pandemic period.",1.0,COVID-19,True

However, these studies have major limitations, including under-ascertainment of SAB, potential selection bias, and lack of a comparison group. Thus, it remains crucial to evaluate the safety of COVID-19 vaccines using a prospective design with regular follow-up. Objectives: To estimate the effect of preconception vaccination against COVID-19 compared with no vaccination, on risk of SAB. Methods: This prospective cohort study was conducted among 1168 pregnant women residing in the United States who enrolled in Pregnancy Online Study (PRESTO) during January 2021-February 2022. PRESTO is a preconception cohort of North American couples aged 21-45 years. On baseline and follow-up questionnaires, individuals report whether they have ever received a COVID-19 vaccine, and if yes, the brand and date they received each dose. On follow-up questionnaires, participants report data on their menstrual periods, whether they are pregnant, and whether/when, they had a pregnancy loss since their last questionnaire. We estimated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) comparing individuals who received at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA or viral vector) before conception, at any time since the development of COVID-19 vaccines, with those who had never received a COVID-19 vaccine before conception. We used propensity score fine stratification to adjust for age; body mass index; race/ethnicity; geographical region; smoking status; education; type of health insurance; healthcare utilization (number of primary care visits in the past year); household income; employment status; job hours per week; diabetes; hypertension; asthma; use of multivitamins and folate supplements; perceived stress scale score; major depression inventory score; nightly sleep duration; number of pregnancy attempt cycles; parity; history of SAB; use of fertility treatment; history of subfertility or infertility; and calendar time. Results: Among 1168 PRESTO participants who became pregnant in 2021-2022, 869 (74%) had received at least one dose of the COVID19 vaccine before conception. The adjusted IRR comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals was 0.90 (95% confidence interval: 0.68, 1.17). Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with no effect of COVID-19 vaccination on SAB. Recently published research in this cohort identified no adverse effect of COVID-19 vaccination on fecundability. Together, these results can be used to guide decision making around COVID-19 vaccination for couples planning pregnancy.",1.0,COVID-19,True

879,"Background: Among the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nMAbs) and antivirals approved in the UK for use in non-hospitalized high-risk COVID-19 patients, sotrovimab and molnupiravir have initially been the two most frequently prescribed drugs. The approval and early clinical use of them was based on two phase 3 RCTs in unvaccinated COVID-19 patients, prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant, and evaluations of their effectiveness in routine care with diverse populations are limited. Objectives: To compare the effectiveness of sotrovimab versus molnupiravir in preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes in nonhospitalized high-risk COVID-19 adult patients. Methods: Setting: With the approval of NHS England, we conducted a real-world cohort study using the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform. The primary care data from 24 million people in England were securely linked with data on COVID-19 infection and therapeutics, hospital admission, and death within the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform, covering a period where both medications were frequently prescribed in community settings. We included non-hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients at high risk of severe outcomes treated with sotrovimab or molnupiravir between December 16, 2021 and February 10, 2022. Interventions: Sotrovimab or molnupiravir administered in the community by COVID-19 Medicine Delivery Units. Main outcome measure: COVID-19 related hospitalization or COVID-19 related death within 28 days after treatment initiation. Statistical analysis: Cox proportional hazards model stratified by area was used, supplemented by propensity score weighting analysis.

882,"Background: Hypoglycemia is a common adverse outcome in diabetes. The ability to accurately identify severe hypoglycemia in administrative claims data can facilitate the comparative safety analysis of antidiabetics. A validated algorithm for hypoglycemia based on ICD-9 diagnosis codes exists, but the performance of an ICD-10 version of the algorithm is unknown. Objectives: To determine the positive predictive value (PPV) of the ICD-10 version of a validated ICD-9 hypoglycemia algorithm. Methods: This validation study was conducted as part of a multicenter retrospective cohort study initiated to compare the effectiveness and safety of oral antidiabetic drugs among patients with renal impairment. We assembled a cohort of Medicare-enrolled diabetes patients with linked electronic health record (EHR) data in the University of North Carolina (UNC) Health System from 10/2015 to 12/2017, which had 6 months of continuous Medicare coverage and were new users of an oral antidiabetic that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We mapped a validated ICD-9 hypoglycemia algorithm to ICD-10 codes and identified potential hypoglycemia events from the Medicare claims. For patients with multiple potential hypoglycemia events, we retained the first event for analysis. We confirmed hypoglycemia events by EHR review. Potential hypoglycemia events with a charted diagnosis or evidence of hypoglycemia in the EHR were validated as hypoglycemia events. We calculated the PPV and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the ICD-10 hypoglycemia algorithm and a kappa statistic between two investigators for a subset of potential hypoglycemia events to evaluate inter-rater agreement of the EHR reviews. Results: We reviewed 586 potential hypoglycemia events based on claims data. Health encounters associated with 267 potential hypoglycemia events (45.7%) occurred outside of the UNC Health System; therefore, charts were not available for review. Of the remaining potential hypoglycemia events (n ,"" 319), we confirmed 264 (82.8%) as true events and 55 (17.2%) as false positives. Thus, the ICD-10 hypoglycemia algorithm had a PPV of 82.8% (95% CI: [78.1%, 86.7%]). Two investigators independently adjudicated 181 potential hypoglycemia events. EHR review for hypoglycemia events had a high interrater agreement (kappa "","" 95.3%, 95% CI: [91.4%, 99.4%]).

888,"Background: Generating fit-for-purpose real-world evidence depends on the underlying data source's quality and information diversity. Mortality ascertainment is a challenge in non-interventional studies given the lack of comprehensive mortality ascertainment in administrative claims or electronic medical records and the under-capture of death events in the Social Security Administration Death Master File (DMF). The National Death Index (NDI) is considered a gold standard for mortality ascertainment in the US. However, this source is timelagged, and some populations have privacy restrictions preventing NDI linkage. Other death data sources have been developed but currently lack validation Objectives: To assess the validity of the mortality data sources compared to NDI within the Health Core Integrated Research Database SM (HIRD). Methods: This study is a secondary analysis of a standing cohort of individuals in the US diagnosed with advanced cancer in HIRD between January 2010 and December 2018 and with an established NDI linkage. Mortality data sources, including inpatient discharge status, termination reasons, DMF, and online obituary data, all updated monthly in the HIRD, were compared to the NDI. Death status (dead/ alive) for each source and the NDI were used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Deaths identified in each source 60 days before and 30 days after NDI death were deemed a match Results: Among 40 692 advanced cancer patients, deaths were identified via NDI linkage for 25 761 (63.3%). Individually, death sources were accurate (all PPV >93%) but had low sensitivity when using the NDI as a gold standard (each with a sensitivity <50%). The DMF had 32% sensitivity (95% CI: 0.31-0.32), and 98% PPV (95% CI: 97-98). An algorithm using mortality data sources altogether was able to identify most deaths from NDI (Sensitivity: 89%, 95% CI: 88-90) with accuracy (PPV ,"" 93%, 95% CI: 93-94). Specificity and NPV had the same magnitude with 90% (95% CI: 89-90) and 82% (95% CI: 82-83), respectively. Other date agreement segments, including ±30, ±15, and ±7 days, had similar results. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that creating an algorithm combining DMF with various additional data sources such as inpatient discharge, termination reason, and obituary data provides an accurate and more sensitive assessment of death outcomes among advanced cancer subjects. The algorithm is shown to provide meaningful sensitivity and accuracy compared to NDI. Further research is needed better to understand the performance of this algorithm in other populations.""",1.0,Social,True

891,"Background: Data-adaptive approaches like the high dimensional propensity score procedure (hd-PS) may help reduce confounding in Pharmacoepidemiologic studies. However, inconsistent medical terminologies in multi-source healthcare databases or single-source databases that experience a drastic change in coding conventions might require novel strategies to deploy hd-PS. As a recent example, the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM in the US health system may pose uncertainty on the hd-PS application for studies spanning both ICD eras in the absence of detailed coding crosswalks. Objectives: To evaluate the performance of three hd-PS deployment strategies in a study on NSAIDs and gastrointestinal bleeding risk with data bridging both ICD eras. Methods: We assembled a base cohort of adult patients in MarketScan® Research Databases (2012-2019) who had newly initiated celecoxib or traditional NSAIDs. We followed patients for six months to identify gastrointestinal bleeding events. Three strategies for hd-PS deployment included: (1) split the cohort by ICD era, deploy hd-PS twice, and pool the relative risks (pooled RR) (2) consider codes from each ICD era as a separate data dimension and deploy hd-PS in the entire cohort (data dimensioning) (3) map ICD codes from both eras to Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) concepts before deploying hd-PS in the entire cohort (CCS mapping). We included age, sex, and 400 empirical covariates in hd-PS and estimated the adjusted RR (95% confidence interval) via the stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights. We calculated percent bias and root-mean-squared error in log RR to compare the three strategies, assuming a gold standard RR of 0.80 based on randomized trials. To examine other possible data scenarios in the real world, we created bootstrapped cohorts with predefined patient selection patterns from the ICD eras and compared the strategies. Results: The base cohort's unadjusted RR was 1.22 (1.12-1.42), and all three strategies reduced bias by 50%. We observed similar adjusted RRs in hypothetical cohort scenarios when the patient selection pattern from each ICD era was comparable between the exposure groups. When a considerable disparity existed in the patient selection pattern, all three strategies resulted in bias reduction. However, we observed a bimodal distribution of propensity scores in the data dimensioning strategy, indicating the presence of instrument-like covariates, and the CCS mapping strategy resulted in 30% less bias than data dimensioning and pooled RR strategies (RMSE: 0.14, 0.19, 0.21, respectively).",1.0,Clinical,True

898,"Background: In Pharmacoepidemiology studies, drug exposure is typically estimated from electronic prescribing records. However, the data preparation process is rarely transparent and subject to a range of assumptions. Prescriptions do not always include key information such as start and stop dates, or daily doses, or else are provided as ambiguous free text instructions. The choices and assumptions made when wrangling these data can have profound implications on estimates of drug exposure, resulting in considerable uncertainty in risk attribution of possible adverse events. Objectives: To develop an open-source software that will advance the efficiency, transparency and reproducibility of drug exposure data preparation. Methods: We developed a two-stage solution. The first package, doseminer, is designed to extract numeric dosage information from free-text English or Latin dispensing instructions. A second package, drugprepr, then estimates the drug exposure period through a variable combination of defensible data processing decisions. Results: The two open-source R packages are available for download from https://CRAN.R-project.org/package,doseminer and https:// CRAN.R-project.org/package,""drugprepr, respectively. The doseminer algorithm represents each free-text prescription instruction using three key metrics: dose number, dose frequency, and dose interval. For each of these three metrics, the range of plausible values is derived. For example, """"one or two tablets per day"""" returns a dose number of 1 (minimum) to 2 (maximum). The drugprepr algorithm is made of eleven distinct preparation steps, covering issues including handling implausible values, dealing with missing data, estimating treatment durations and handling sequential prescriptions with small gaps or overlaps. At each step, the user inputs a decision about how the data will be transformed. By describing the decisions taken at each step, the data preparation process can be replicated. We can vary one or multiple decisions in the data preparation pathway, thereby reporting a range of outcomes and exploring many `researcher degrees of freedom'.

902,"Background: The use of longitudinal mixture models such as groupbased trajectory modeling has seen a sharp increase during the last decades in the Pharmacoepidemiology and public health literature. However, these methods have been criticized especially because of the data-driven modeling process, which involves statistical decisionmaking. Objectives: To validate the number of groups identified from latent class methods and to quantify the uncertainty in the number of groups. Methods: We propose an approach that uses bootstrap to sample with replacement observations from the original data. For each bootstrap sample, the number of groups is selected using the Bayesian Information Criterion. The method allows investigating the statistical validity and the uncertainty of the groups identified in the original data by checking if the same solution is also found across the bootstrap samples. We evaluated the performance of our proposed approach using a simulation study. Scenarios with different sample sizes, number, and shapes of groups were simulated. Datasets were generated using a multivariate normal model and 100 replications for each scenario were generated. For each replication, we applied our proposed approach taking 100 bootstrap samples and examined whether the bootstrap-estimated variability in the number of groups reflected the replication-wise variability. We also compared the replication-wise variability to the Bayesian posterior probability of group numbers. We evaluated the ability of three commonly used adequacy criteria to identify uncertainty in the number of groups (average posterior probability, odds of correct classification and relative entropy). Finally, we illustrated the proposed approach using data from the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System to identify longitudinal medication patterns during 2015 and 2018 in people aged 75 to 80 years with diabetes. Results: The bootstrap approach reproduced the true variability very well. The Bayesian posterior probability also performed well in most of the scenarios. However, in the scenario with intersecting groups and a sample size of 100, the posterior probability strongly underestimated the true variability. Common adequacy criteria were unable to detect the uncertainty in the number of groups. Conclusions: We suggest the use of our bootstrap approach combined to other model adequacy criteria to better assess the quality of the classification in longitudinal mixture model.",1.0,epidemiology,True

908,"Background: When evaluating the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies for type 2 diabetes, adjustment for pre-treatment hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is usually needed for proper confounding control. Traditional claims data, commonly used in Pharmacoepidemiologic research, often lack clinical measurements on HbA1c, but it is unknown if other information in claims data can be used to determine pre-treatment HbA1c. Objectives: (1) To measure the concordance of pre-treatment HbA1c categories based on electronic health record (EHR) data versus outpatient lab results linked to claims data, and (2) To use machine learning to predict EHR-based pre-treatment HbA1c from claims-based features. Methods: We used data from the OptumLabs® Data Warehouse, containing de-identified EHR and administrative claims data, including linked outpatient (""claims-affiliated"") lab results. Emulating eligibility criteria from a prior published trial, we identified metformin-treated adults with type 2 diabetes who initiated combination therapy with liraglutide or glimepiride between Feb 2010 and Jun 2019. Eligible initiators also had a pre-treatment HbA1c result available in their linked EHR data. Among the subgroup of initiators with a claims-affiliated pre-treatment HbA1c result available, we measured the concordance of pre-treatment HbA1c categories (<8%, 8%9%, and 9%) from lab results in EHR versus claims data. Among all initiators, we derived and internally validated (using a 9:1 train-test split) an ensemble learner combining 6 machine learning algorithms to predict EHR-based pretreatment HbA1c, as a continuous variable, from 46 claims-based features describing demographics, comorbidities, medications, illness severity, and claims-affiliated pre-treatment HbA1c results.

We used a multivariable multinomial logistic regression model to estimate relative risk ratios (RRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the factors associated with OAC or aspirin-only prescribing compared to no treatment in patients with NVAF who are recommended to take OAC. The multivariable regression was adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, baseline treatment, frailty, bleeding risk factors, and takes into account clustering by general practice. Between 2009 and 2019, 12 517 191 patients met the criteria for being at-risk of developing NVAF. After a median follow-up of 4.6 years, 192 265 patients had an incident NVAF contributing a total of 647 876 person-years (PYR) of follow-up. The overall age-adjusted incidence of NVAF per 10 000 PYR increased from 20.8 (95% CI: 20.4; 21.1) in 2009 to 25.5 (25.1; 25.9) in 2019. Higher incidence rates were observed for older ages and males.

The main limitation of this study is that these findings depends on accurate recording of conditions by health professionals and the inevitable residual confounding due to lack of data on certain factors that could be associated with under-prescribing of OACs. Conclusion The incidence of NVAF increased between 2009 and 2015, before plateauing. Underprescribing of OACs in NVAF is associated with a range of comorbidities, ethnicity and socioeconomic factors, demonstrating the need for initiatives to reduce inequalities in the care for AF patients.",1.0,disease,True

Objectives: Here we examine racial disparities in oncology trial participation from 2017 to 2021. Methods: This retrospective study uses data from the de-identified, electronic health record (EHR)-derived Flatiron Health database from the US. The cohort included patients diagnosed with five common cancers between January 2017 and September 2021 (follow-up through December 2021) and initiated treatment. We examined differences between Black and White patients in trial participation (defined as documented receipt of clinical trial drugs after diagnosis). To characterize differences in trial participation, we used a time-toevent analysis where patients were followed from diagnosis to their first treatment with a clinical trial drug, death, or last recorded activity. Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for demographic characteristics (age, sex, and diagnosis year) were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: The cohort included 45 750 patients (15% Black, 56% female, median age of 68, 87% from community oncology practices). During the study period, 5.2% of patients participated in clinical trials, including 3.5% of Black patients and 5.4% of White patients.

Prior studies have shown racial disparities in newer GLDs use. However, whether such disparities were modulated by geographic variation in newer GLDs access and how such disparities distribute across the US are unclear. Methods: Using 2017-2018 claims data from a 15% random nationwide sample of Medicare Part D beneficiaries, we identified patients diagnosed with T2D, received 1 T2D medication, and did not use SGLT2i or GLP1a in the year prior to the index date--1/1/2018. Patients were followed up for a year. The cohort was spatiotemporally linked to Dartmouth hospital-referral regions (HRRs) with each patient assigned to 1 of 306 HRRs. We performed multivariable Poisson regression to estimate adjusted initiation rates, and multivariable logistic regression to assess racial disparities in each HRR.

The proportion of COVID-19 patients initiating corticosteroids in the South of the US was higher than in any other region. Outpatient corticosteroid initiation dramatically increased over time and did not appear to be restricted to older people. Over 50% initiated corticosteroids on the day of diagnosis; mostly through pharmacy dispensings (70.8%-92.0%). Azithromycin, the most common outpatient concomitant therapy (33.6%-48.8%), was often initiated on the same date as the corticosteroid. Few patients (1.5%) had recorded oxygen use between COVID-19 and corticosteroid initiation. The proportion of any-cause and COVID-19-related hospitalizations in the 30 days post-initiation ranged from 7.9% to 17.5% and 6.3%-16.1%, respectively. Conclusions: Despite NIH recommendations, increasing numbers of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients initiated systemic corticosteroids. Given the potential safety signal, lack of data in mild-tomoderate COVID-19 and potential delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance, it is critical that providers consider the NIH guidelines for nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients.

From 2008 to 2019, broad-spectrum antibiotic use decreased from 46% to 20% in otherwise healthy patients (average annual percentage change [AAPC], À7.2% [95% CI À8.8%, À5.5%]), and from 57% to 31% in patients with comorbidities (AAPC, À5.4% [95% CI À7.6%, À3.3%]). In subgroup analyzes, broad-spectrum antibiotic use varied by rural-urban status, geographic region, provider type, and outpatient setting. Conclusions: Real-world use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for outpatient CAP declined over time, irrespective of comorbidity status. Nonguideline concordant use of broad-spectrum agents remained common among otherwise healthy patients, particularly in certain subgroups.

However, few observational studies confirmed its level of effectiveness when prescribed in common practice to diverse profiles of users. Objectives: To assess real-world PrEP effectiveness among adult men at high risk of HIV infection in France. Methods: Based on information of the French National Health Data System (SNDS), we conducted a nested case-control study among adult men identified at high risk of HIV infection between January 2016 and June 2020. Newly HIV-infected cases identified until December 2020 were individually matched on age, socioeconomic status, place of residence, calendar year and follow-up duration with up to five controls, using risk set sampling. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds-ratios (aOR) of HIV infection associated with PrEP use. PrEP effectiveness, computed as 1-aOR, was estimated overall, by PrEP use modalities and by individuals' sociodemographic characteristics.

However, evidence regarding the efficacy and risk of such co-medication is limited, especially for suicidal outcomes. Objectives: We sought to evaluate the impact of adding another nonSSRI CNS drug during SSRI treatment on the risk of suicidal behavior, in a data-driven screening approach. Methods: We used data from linkage of Swedish national registers and identified a national cohort of SSRI users aged 6-59 years residing in Sweden during 2006-2013. We used a two-stage Bayesian Poisson model to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of suicidal behavior in periods up to 90 days before and after another non-SSRI CNS drug initiation during SSRI treatment, while accounting for multiple testing. For comparison, and to assess whether there were interactions between SSRIs and other CNS drugs, we also estimated the IRR of initiating the CNS drug without SSRI treatment. Results: We identified 53 common non-SSRI CNS drugs initiated during SSRI treatment, dispensed to 262 721 individuals. We found 20 CNS drugs with statistically significant IRRs during any SSRI treatment. Of these, only two showed a greater risk of suicidal behavior after versus before initiating a CNS drug (alprazolam, IRR ,"" 1.39, 95% CrI "","" 1.13, 1.71; flunitrazepam, IRR "","" 1.83, 95% CrI "","" 1.11, 3.07).

We did not find evidence of harmful interactions between SSRIs and the selected CNS drugs. Conclusions: Several of the detected signals for reduced risk correspond to drugs where there is previous evidence of benefit for antidepressant augmentation (e.g., olanzapine, quetiapine, lithium, buspirone, and mirtazapine). Novel signals of reduced suicidal behavior risk, including lamotrigine, valproic acid, risperidone, and melatonin, when using in addition to SSRIs, warrant further investigation.""",1.0,flu,True

Second-generation long-acting injectable antipsychotics (SG-LAIAs) have been shown to reduce risk of these outcomes in observational studies and pragmatic clinical trials. Objectives: To determine the risk of treatment failure, defined as treatment discontinuation, psychiatric hospitalization, suicide and incarceration, in patients treated with SG-LAIAs versus patients treated with other antipsychotics. Methods: We used linked administrative health, registry, and justice data from the Manitoba Center for Health Policy (MCHP) in Manitoba, Canada. We formed a cohort of new SG-LAIA users between February 2005 and March 2020 who had no previous SG-LAIA dispensation in a 365-day look back period. SG-LAIA users were categorized as incident new user (no prior-year antipsychotic dispensation) or prevalent new user (prior-year oral or first-generation long-acting injectable antipsychotic dispensation). We created an exposure set of eligible antipsychotic user comparators for each SG-LAIA new user, matched on calendar time, prior duration of antipsychotic use, and number of antipsychotics used in the look back period. Each SG-LAIA user was matched 1:1 with the comparator from the exposure set with the closest time-conditional propensity score. We used Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for time-varying antipsychotic polypharmacy during follow up to estimate risk of treatment failure in SG-LAIA users versus matched comparators. Secondary outcomes were treatment discontinuation, psychiatric hospitalization, and incarceration. Results: The cohort consisted of 343 matched pairs, of which 156 pairs were prevalent new users and 187 were incident new users. Overall, SG-LAIA use was associated with lower risk of treatment failure versus matched antipsychotic comparators (adjusted hazard ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.59-0.77). SG-LAIAs reduced risk of incarceration (aHR 0.67, 95% CI 0.500.90) and treatment discontinuation (aHR 0.62, 95% CI 0.53-0.72) but not psychiatric hospitalization (aHR 1.07, 95% CI 0.89-1.29).

However, the evidence underpinning these guidelines is limited, based on subgroup analyzes from randomized trials, early observational studies, or expert opinion. Further investigation is needed to better inform the guidelines with regards to the effectiveness of remdesivir in these patients. Objectives: To estimate the effect of a remdesivir initiation within two days of hospital admission compared with no remdesivir treatment on mortality among hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: The data include inpatient claims for billable products, procedures, and services from 297 hospitals across the United States. Adult patients admitted to the hospital with a COVID-19 diagnosis between May 1, 2020 and August 15, 2021 and no prior emergent care were included in the study. Baseline comorbidities were recorded from hospital encounters at or up to 12 months prior to admission. Timing and use of in-hospital medications, procedures, and oxygen were identified from hospital charges. Mortality was defined as a discharge disposition of death or transfer to hospice. Discharge with any other disposition treated was considered a competing event. The data were analyzed using a clone-censor-weight approach designed to emulate a randomized clinical trial. First, two copies of each patient were created, one for each treatment protocol. Second, patient copies were artificially censored at the time of deviation from their group's protocol. Finally, a Cox proportional hazard model was fit, conditional on baseline and timevarying covariates, to estimate the probability of remaining uncensored at each time point. Cumulative risks and risk differences were estimated with inverse probability of censoring weighted estimators. Results: Overall, 223 081 patients were included, contributing 1 265 692 person-days to the remdesivir protocol and 1 152 472 to the no remdesivir protocol. The estimated counterfactual 30-day mortality risks were 13.0% (95% CI: 12.8%, 13.3%) and 18.4% (95% CI 17.6%, 19.2%) for the remdesivir and no remdesivir protocols, respectively, for a risk difference of À5.4% (95% CI: À6.3%, À4.5%). The risk differences were À3.7% (95% CI: À5.9%, À1.5%), À10.1% (95% CI: À15.8%, À4.4%), and À7.3% (95% CI: À12.2%, À2.3%) for patients on low-flow oxygen, high-flow oxygen, and mechanical ventilation, respectively. Conclusions: In this large study of patients hospitalized with COVID19, we found that remdesivir treatment within two days of hospital admission reduced mortality compared with no remdesivir use during the hospital stay.

Objectives: We sought to validate this finding using independent realworld data from community oncology practices across the US. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of aNSCLC patients who initiated pembrolizumab monotherapy for first line treatment and had a PDL1 + e  50% using a nationwide, de-identified longitudinal electronic health record--derived database (Flatiron Health). We excluded patients with incomplete treatment data, those harboring alterations in EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 genes, and patients with a gap of >90 days between diagnosis and first visit or medication order. The primary outcome was overall survival, measured from initiation of pembrolizumab to date of death or last confirmed activity. Multiple imputation was used to impute missing covariates. Propensity scorebased inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to address confounding in Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard regression models. Baseline characteristics included in IPW were age at therapy initiation, race, sex, smoking history, and tumor histology, presence of KRAS or BRAF mutation, and ECOG performance status. Results: The cohort included1952 aNSCLC patients receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy. A 50% of cohort members were female, median age at first line therapy initiation was 73 years IQR [65-80], 71% had non-squamous histology, 94% had a history of smoking, 24% had a KRAS mutation, and 46% had very high PDL1 + e. IPW successfully balanced baseline covariates. Median overall survival in the weighted sample from the index date was 15.84 months [very high ÀPDL1 + e (90%)] versus 12.72 months [high ÀPDL1 + e (50%- 89%)], respectively.

Conclusions: After adjusting for potential confounders, patients with PDL1+e very high (90%) aNSCLC receiving first-line pembrolizumab experienced prolonged median survival compared to those with high PDL1+ (50-89%) in a multicenter real-world setting.

However, whether HCQ use can prevent other CV events remains to be examined further. Objectives: To evaluate the association between HCQ use and CV events in patients with SLE. Methods: We conducted a nested case-control study within a cohort of SLE patients using the nationwide French health care database (SNDS), which records all in-and outpatient claims, as well as hospital discharges, for more than 65 million inhabitants. SLE patients with at least a follow-up of 5 years in the database were identified over the period from 2010 to 2020 and were followed up to 31 December 2020. Study outcomes consisted of the composite of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or VTE, as well as individual components. Each case was the first outcome among the three components that occurred after SLE cohort entry and after a period of 5 years with no occurrence of the same outcome. For each outcome, date of first hospital discharge with the relevant diagnostic code was the index date. Controls were selected using incidence density sampling (case: control ratio up to 1:10) and matched on age, sex, time since first SLE code in the database and time since entry in the database, index date, use of anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs and use of CV drug in the last year, chronic kidney disease, hospitalization in the last year. HCQ exposure was categorized as current (last HCQ dispensing 1-90 days prior to index date), recent (last dispensing 91-365 days prior), or no dispensing in the year before index date. We used conditional logistic regression to evaluate the association between HCQ exposure and CV events, controlling for prior other CV event for the individual outcomes, and in the previous year, for the dispensing of other SLE treatments or NSAIDs, and number of outpatient visits. Results: The SLE cohort included 56 544 patients followed for a mean of 10.4 years. We identified 2355 cases of composite CV outcome, 737 MI, 1032 stroke, 783 VTE, and 22 444 matched controls.

1008,"Background: Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for developing atrial fibrillation (AF). Data from clinical trials suggest that sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may reduce the risk of AF. Objectives: To assess the association between use of SGLT2 inhibitors and the risk of new-onset AF in routine clinical practice. Methods: We used nationwide registers in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, 2013-2018, to include patients without history of AF who were newly prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor or an active comparator (glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonist). We performed a cohort study to assess new-onset AF in intention-to-treat analyzes using Cox regression, adjusted for covariates with propensity score weighting. Results: We identified 79 343 new users of SGLT2 inhibitors and 57 613 new users of GLP-1 receptor agonists. The adjusted incidence rate of new-onset AF was 8.6 per 1000 person-years for new users of SGLT2 inhibitors as compared with 10.0 per 1000 personyears for new users of GLP-1 receptor agonists. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) was 0.89 (95% CI 0.81-0.96) and the rate difference was 1.4 fewer events per 1000 person-years (95% CI 0.6-2.1). Using an as-treated exposure definition, the aHR for new-onset AF was 0.87 (95% CI 0.76-0.99). No statistically significant heterogeneity of the aHRs was observed between subgroups of patients with and without a history of heart failure or major cardiovascular disease. Conclusions: In this cohort study, using nationwide data from three countries, use of SGLT2 inhibitors as compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists, was associated with a reduced risk of new-onset AF.",1.0,trial,True

1014,"Background: Most patients with type 2 diabetes require combination glucose-lowering therapy; however, the effectiveness or safety of combination therapies are rarely assessed in either randomized trials or observational studies. Emerging data suggest that the combination of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) may yield complementary cardiovascular benefit. Objectives: To compare cardiovascular benefits of adding GLP-1RA versus dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) in patients on SGLT2i therapy. Methods: Using 3 US claims datasets (2013-2019), we conducted a cohort study of patients with type 2 diabetes who initiated either GLP-1RA or DPP-4i (index drug) while on SGLT2i therapy. Patients were 1:1 matched on their propensity score (PS) within each dataset and followed from the day after initiation of index drug (GLP-1RA or DPP-4i) for as long as they were exposed to both SGLT2i and index exposure. Secondary analysis included an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach where patients were followed for 365 days regardless of changes in therapy. Primary outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. Secondary outcomes included MI, stroke, allcause mortality, the composite of MI, stroke or all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF). Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazard model in each dataset and in the pooled data, stratifying on a dataset. Results: The PS-matched cohort comprised 41 586 GLP-1RA initiators and 41 586 DPP4i initiator (mean age 60 years, 55% men). Over the mean follow-up of 169 days, the primary outcome occurred in 215 GLP-1RA initiators (incidence rate [IR] 11.3 per 1000 person-years) and in 258 DPP4i initiators (IR 13.1 per 1000 person-years) with the HR of 0.87 (95% CI 0.721.04) for GLP-1RA as compared with DPP-4i. The results were similar for the secondary outcomes; however, patients initiating GLP-1RA while on SGLT2i had lower rates of HHF (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.41-0.80). The ITT analysis yielded more attenuated association for HHF (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.63-0.96), but stronger association for the primary outcome (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.70-0.92). Conclusions: In this large cohort study of US patients with type 2 diabetes already treated with SGLT2i therapy, the addition of GLP1RA- compared to DPP4i-was associated with reduced risk of HHF in primary, as-treated analysis, and reduced risk of MI/stroke in ITT",1.0,trial,True

We required the mothers to be continuously enrolled from 20 weeks prior to the non-live birth date until 1 month thereafter, and identified the subset who received care at Mass General Brigham, a hospital network in the Boston area. We retrieved the medical records for 195 SAB and 240 terminations, which were independently reviewed by 2 clinicians who extracted the GA at the pregnancy end date (gold standard). We developed: ALG 1: assign national median GA (i.e., SAB: 9 weeks; terminations: 8 weeks); ALG 2: assign GA randomly drawn from GA distributions reported in the literature; ALG 3: use a random forest (RF) model to predict GA based on the timing of prenatal screening tests, proximate etiologies for non-livebirth outcomes, and maternal risk factors. ALG performance was assessed based on the proportion of pregnancies with estimated GA within 1 and 4 weeks of the gold standard GA, the mean squared error (MSE) and the Rsquared, estimated using 10-fold cross-validation. Results: For both outcomes, ALG 2 performed the worst and ALG 3 (RF) performed slightly better than ALG 1. For SAB, 35.4% were correctly classified within 1 week and 84.1% were correctly classified within 4 weeks of the gold standard using the RF model (MSE: 11.4, R-squared: 0.02). For termination, the proportions were 51.7% and 90.4% respectively (MSE: 10.4; R-squared: 0.36). The R-squared was low across ALGs for both outcomes indicating the prediction of the ALGs did not explain much of the variation in GA. Conclusions: Depending on the research questions, SABs and terminations can be studied in claims data with careful implementation of the validated algorithms. However, investigators should be cognizant of the higher level of misclassification of GA for these pregnancy outcomes compared to live births and the potential implications for misclassification of the etiologically relevant time window.",1.0,case,True

1051,"Vanderbilt University Medical Center Background: Prior work suggests postpartum opioid use is associated with an increased risk of persistent opioid use. Whether low-dose opioid use is `safe' after delivery is of great clinical interest, yet the use of simple regression approaches (linear/categorical) to study this question can mischaracterize effects when there is a high proportion of non-users or low-dose data are sparse. Objectives: To compare modeling strategies for estimating the association between low-dose initial postpartum opioid use after vaginal delivery and total opioid dose used in the subsequent postpartum period.

1055,"2014). Prescription fill data were used to characterize total opioid dose (MME) filled in the initial postpartum period (exposure: day 3 pre-delivery to postpartum day 5) and in the subsequent postpartum period (outcome: postpartum day 6 to 42). Covariates were measured from day 180 pre-delivery to postpartum day 5. We used linear regression, adjusting for covariates, to compare strategies for modeling initial opioid dose, such as: (1) categorical terms, (2) a linear term, (3) natural cubic splines, and (4) fractional polynomials. For continuous models (2-4), we examined the use of a ""spike"" indicator term to distinguish initial users from non-users. With initial non-users as reference, we examined the dose response curves at low doses (<75 MME) across modeling strategies. Results: Among 147 414 vaginal births, 53.3% of women filled an initial postpartum opioid; few filled doses <75 MME (2.5%). In models without a ""spike"" term, the dose-response curves were forced through a y-intercept of 0 and had narrow confidence intervals (CI) (despite sparse data in the low-dose range) that indicated a significant positive association with subsequent opioid dose as initial dose increased from 0 to 75 MME. In contrast, the categorical and spline models with a ""spike"" term had dose-response curves with wide CI that were not significantly different from the null value at low doses and showed a negative association as initial dose increased from 0 to 75 MME. Importantly, all models demonstrated a significant positive association between an initial opioid dose >150 MME and subsequent postpartum opioid dose. Conclusions: The association between low-dose initial postpartum use and subsequent opioid use is sensitive to the modeling strategy in the presence of non-linear relationships and infrequent low-dose prescriptions. Studies of opioid doses should use flexible modeling approaches that do not presume a ""through-the-origin"" dose response curve to prevent a false illusion of safe vs. non-safe doses where they do not exist.",1.0,curve,True

1059,"making in pregnancy requires a sophisticated trade-off between benefits and all possible risks. Large healthcare utilization databases allow for simultaneous screening across a broad range of potential adverse pregnancy outcomes using scan statistic approaches such as TreeScanTM. When using such a safety surveillance approach, hierarchical classification of the outcomes based on shared pathogenetic mechanisms increases the power to detect signals for clinically related outcomes. Objectives: We explored the use of hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) to help inform the classification of congenital malformations, an outcome of most immediate concern. Methods: Using a pregnancy cohort of >1.8 million mother-child dyads nested within the Medicaid Analytic eXtract 2000-2014, we identified 251 878 children with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) malformation codes (740.x-759.x) documented within 3 months after birth. After assessing the Pearson correlation coefficient for each unique pair of malformation codes, we applied agglomerative HCA, and created a cluster dendrogram. The dendrogram was manually reviewed to screen out clusters of codes used interchangeably (e.g., ""unspecified"" and ""other"") and clusters based on extremely sparse data. Results: We identified the following clusters: (1) Malformations belonging to the same organ, organ system or body part (e.g., urinary tract anomalies, cleft lip and cleft palate, components within cardiac anomalies) which are grouped in existing clinical coding systems such as the ICD; (2) known combinations and sequences across different organ systems (e.g., splenic and cardiac anomalies in the context of situs inverses) not grouped in existing coding systems; (3) not previously recognized combinations of malformations occurring together more often than expected by chance (e.g., Meckel's diverticulum and urachus anomaly); and (4) malformations that seemed to stand on their own (e.g., pyloric stenosis, abdominal wall defects, transverse limb defects). Conclusions: This human-assisted HCA based approach for hierarchical outcome classification suggested splitting and lumping certain malformations that are not considered as such in classification systems organized by body system. Augmenting existing clinical classifications with clusters identified through large data exploration may be a promising approach when defining phenotypes for scanning-based safety surveillance activities and causal inference studies of congenital malformations and, by extension, other outcomes.",1.0,clinical,True

1066,"strategies are needed to gather evidence related to safety during pregnancy. Objectives: The objective of this work is to develop a scientifically rigorous framework to assess drug safety during pregnancy faster than a pregnancy registry, while maintaining precision. The framework extends from initial work with fingolimod and takes into account previous learnings. Methods: PRegnancy outcomes Intensive Monitoring (PRIM) is a framework to evaluate risk of drug exposure during pregnancy on pregnancy and infant outcomes. PRIM involves improving data collection, quality, and processing of pregnancies spontaneously reported by healthcare professionals (HCPs) or consumers to a marketing authorization holder. PRIM uses targeted follow-up questionnaires sent to the reporter or HCP at structured follow-up time points, rigorous data entry and quality control, and provides an end-to-end process from data extraction to analyzes. PRIM data collection and processing involves information relative to all pregnancies whether with normal or abnormal outcomes, enabling the calculation of prevalence estimates (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) of adverse outcomes, such as major congenital malformations (MCM). Prospective cases are focused on to reduce reporting bias. PRIM is classified as a non-interventional post-authorization safety study and transcends pharmacovigilance activities in several ways: (1) at least two external, independent experts adjudicate malformation cases based on data provided by the reporter or HCP; (2) an enhanced data quality control and correction system ensures data rigor; (3) PRIM uses pre-specified programs to extract and analyze aggregate data as defined a priori in a statistical analysis plan. Results: Gilenya/fingolimod was the first clinical program to apply a PRIM framework and served as a pilot. From 1-Mar-2014 to 28-Feb2021, PRIM enrolled 698 prospective cases with known pregnancy outcome, resulting in a MCM prevalence in live births of 2.2% (95% CI: 1.13.9). Conversely, from 1-Oct-2011 to 28-Feb-2021, the Gilenya pregnancy registry enrolled 297 women, with a MCM prevalence of 6.0% (95% CI: 3.3-9.8). To date, five products use the PRIM framework. The European Medicines Agency accepted PRIM as an alternative to a pregnancy registry and US Food and Drug Administration accepted it as an adjunct strategy. Conclusions: With PRIM, Novartis is able to provide consumers and HCPs with crucial information on safety during pregnancy faster compared to a pregnancy registry.",1.0,case,True

1070,"will require the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or oral corticosteroids (OCS) for disease control over the course of gestation. It is unclear whether the disease process alone increases the risk of adverse birth outcomes, or whether the excess risk is mediated through the use of these medications. Objectives: To quantify the medication mediated effects of DMARDs and OCS on the risk of preterm birth and small for gestational age among women with rheumatic conditions. Methods: We used data collected from Mother to Baby Pregnancy Studies between 2005 and 2019. Eligible women had a singleton, live birth, and either had a rheumatic condition (rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or psoriatic arthritis), or had no history of any autoimmune disorder. DMARDs (biologic and non-biologic) or OCS used between LMP and 37 weeks or delivery were assessed for risk of preterm birth and small for gestational age, respectively. We performed a causal mediation analysis to identify the natural direct and natural indirect effects, and the proportion mediated by each medication according to methods described by Tchetgen and Phiri. Loglinear regression models for the total effect and direct effect were adjusted for maternal age, education, race/ethnicity, pre-pregnancy BMI, asthma, and tobacco use. Models for the direct effect were weighted for women with rheumatic conditions by computing the predicted probability from a log-linear regression of medication use during pregnancy on risk factors (education, planned pregnancy, tobacco use) and a disease severity measure, the Health Assessment Questionnaire. Results: From 2182 women, 975 had a rheumatic condition. Preterm births occurred more frequently in women with rheumatic conditions (12.9% vs. 7.0%; aRR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4, 2.4). DMARDs mediated 32% of the total risk, OCS mediated 62%. Indirect effect estimates for DMARDs included the null. Small for gestational age offspring was increased in women with rheumatic conditions (9.7% vs. 5.8%, aRR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3, 2.5); 6% of the total effect was mediated through DMARDs, and 13% through OCS, although indirect effect estimates crossed the null for both agents. Conclusions: Mediation through DMARDs and OCS were only notable for the risk of preterm birth. The strongest mediation was observed through OCS, although residual confounding by disease severity may remain.",1.0,disease,True

Therefore, new methods for signal detection, such as tree-based scan statistics, are emerging. Objectives: This study aimed to detect potential safety signals following the initiation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) using tree-based scan statistics. It was investigated whether signals were unknown or listed in the Danish Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPCs). Signals were compared to those found in a previous study using active surveillance with repeated cohorts. Methods: Using Danish healthcare data from 1996 to 2016, we conducted a data mining study on 15 one-to-one propensity scorematched cohorts of new users of SSRIs and SNRIs. Propensity scores were estimated from a standard set of covariates. Patients were followed for a maximum of 6 months from treatment initiation until an outcome of interest or censoring. Signal detection was performed using the software TreeScan® on incident events on all levels of an ICD-10 diagnosis tree. Results: In total, 300 unique combinations of exposure, comparator, and medical events were identified. Most of these (82%) were considered unknown. Seven (36.8%) signals suggested for further evaluation in the previous study with repeated cohorts, which were present at the end of the study, were re-detected using tree-based scan statistics. Of these, six were unknown and suggested for further evaluation. For citalopram, these were hepatic failure, ischemic stroke, and renal failure. For escitalopram, they were cardiomyopathy, hemorrhagic stroke (detected as intracerebral hemorrhage), and renal failure. Conclusions: Tree-based scan statistics were able to detect a large number of signals of adverse events to SSRIs and SNRIs, of which the majority were unknown. Several signals identified in a previous study were confirmed using the tree-based scan statistics.",0.0,,False

Although this is included in the product information of some of these vaccines, data from Europe are scarce and inconsistent about vaccine and dosespecific effects. Objectives: To report absolute and relative incidence rates (IRs) of myo-/pericarditis before and after COVID-19 disease, and after each dose of four EMA-approved COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We combined primary and secondary healthcare data from Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Spain using a common data model. All individuals with complete data in 2020 were included from 1 January to 31 August 2021, end of data availability, or first myo-or pericarditis diagnosis. We calculated IRs before and after exposure to COVID-19 disease and after each vaccine dose. A nested self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) study including only vaccinated cases was performed to calculate IR ratios based on a 60-day control period prior to vaccination and dosespecific 28-day risk window. This design adjusts for all time-fixed confounders. Results: The cohort comprised 25 720 158 individuals (49% women) aged 46 years, of which 47% received one vaccine dose and 27% two. The SCRI included 948 myo-/pericarditis cases. Myocarditis IRs were similar between young (12-29 years) and old (>30 years) individuals (3.6 vs. 3.4 per 100 000 person-years, respectively), whereas pericarditis IRs were lower in the younger group (9.1 vs. 14.2, respectively).

A similar trend was observed for Moderna, but there were insufficient individuals with a second dose of this vaccine to allow for valid analysis. Analyzes in updated data instances with more vaccinated individuals are ongoing. Conclusions: Incidence of myo-/pericarditis was increased after COVID-19 disease in all age groups and after the second Pfizer dose in those aged 12-29 years. Although a similar trend was seen for Moderna, data was too limited to draw any conclusions.

Objectives: To screen for potential statin-related prescribing cascades using high-throughput sequence symmetry analysis (SSA). Methods: Using IBM Marketscan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Claims from Jan 2005 to Dec 2019, we identified new station users aged 20 years with continuous insurance enrollment 720 days before and 360 days after statin initiation. We screened statin initiators against all other drug classes (defined by anatomical therapeutic classification Level 4 codes) within 90 days of statin initiation-using SSA. SSA generated sequence ratios relating the proportion of statin initiators who start the other drug class after, versus before, the statin, while adjusting for prescribing time trends (adjusted sequence ratios [aSRs]). We then calculated naturalistic numbers needed to harm (NNTH)--the inverse of the number of other drug class initiators after starting a statin minus the number initiating before statin use, divided by the number of statin initiators. Three independent reviewers classified each significant signal as a potential prescribing cascade or not. Results: Overall, 2 290 011 statin initiators were included. We screened 526 classes, of which 160 had a positive signal (significant aSR). After review, 47 signals (29.4%) were classified as potential prescribing cascades. The top 3 classes considered potential prescribing cascades, as ranked by NNTH, along with their potential indication, were: (1) osmotically acting laxatives (A06AD; constipation; NNTH 44); (2) opioids in combination with non-opioid analgesics (N02AJ; pain/myalgia; NNTH 81); (3) first generation cephalosporins (J01DB; skin infection; NNTH 204). Additionally, we identified other clinically relevant potential cascades including antiinfectives (S03AA; eye/ear infections; NNTH 781); acetylcholinesterases (N06DA; cognitive impairment; NNTH 1250); and dantrolene (M03CA, rhabdomyolysis; NNTH , 30 523) Conclusions: High-throughput SSA screening is a novel approach to identifying CV-related prescribing cascades.

Objectives: To determine the frequency and nature (including causative drugs and drug-ADE combinations) of ADEs described in physician notes for dermatology patients. Methods: Physician free-text notes recorded during outpatient visits at five specialty dermatology networks in the OMNY Health Dermatology Database were used. All notes were de-identified and only non-templated entries were included. A pre-trained ADE classifier was used to screen which of the entries contained information about ADEs. Positive entries were passed to a named entity recognition (NER) pipeline for detection of drug and ADE entities. A relation extraction (RE) model was then applied to determine which of the drug-ADE pairs were related. Finally, an assertion status module was applied to classify the nature of the drug-ADE relationship (e.g., present, absent, conditional). Pre-trained biomedical text embeddings and natural language processing (NLP) models available in a licensed software package (Spark NLP for Healthcare; Lewes, Delaware, US) were used. Results: Approximately 448 million free-text entries from 4.1 million distinct patients were collected and de-identified. After removal of template text, 8.7 million free-text entries from 2.5 million distinct patients and 6.0 million distinct encounters were ultimately used in the analysis. The ADE classifier identified 25 984 entries (0.3%) as potentially containing ADE related information. Further application of the NER pipeline and RE model yielded 7640 drug-ADE relations across 5299 distinct patients. Assertion status results identified 5307 (69%) of the ADEs as being present. Among these present ADEs, the five most common causative agents were isotretinoin, spironolactone, doxycycline, tretinoin, and triamcinolone, which together accounted for 17% of ADEs. The top adverse event entity was rash (16%), followed by dryness (1.9%) headaches (1.7%), joint pain (1.6%), and hair loss (1.5%). When specific drug-ADE combinations were tallied, the five most common drug-ADE entities all included isotretinoin as the causative agent (dryness, headaches, joint pain, mood changes, and cheilitis). Conclusions: These results suggest that acne medications are the most common causative agents for many of the ADEs observed in specialty dermatology networks. Additionally, they suggest that pretrained, end-to-end NLP systems are effective for characterizing ADEs in clinical text.

Post-authorization safety surveillance enables early insights into the real-world safety profile of vaccination. Preliminary findings from one of the first US-based COVID-19 observational studies on post-vaccine outcomes are presented below. Objectives: To estimate incidence rates of adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and other clinically significant events among recipients of a COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: HERO-Together is a prospective observational cohort study of healthcare workers, their families, and members of the community. Participants self-enroll up to 60 days following their first vaccine dose using a participant-facing web portal. Data on COVID-19 vaccination, demographics, medical history, nonroutine medical care (including hospitalization), and AESI occurrence are collected via participant self-report at regular intervals. Medical records are collected and adjudicated to confirm participant-reported safety events.

We identified women aged 13-40 years old who got a 52 mg LNG IUS in 2019 (without previous utilization of a LNG IUS) and a control group who got a 19.5 mg LNGIUS, matched (1:1) on age (±3 years), pregnancies in the 10 years before, month of delivery in 2019 (±3) and type of physician (general practitioner, gynecologist or midwife). Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals to study the associations between the type of LNG-IUSs and the use of anxiolytics, hypnotics, and antidepressants within two years after dispensing. Results: A total of 45 736 women with a LNG 52 mg IUS (mean age: 32.3 [5.4]) and 45 736 women with a LNG 19.5 mg IUS (mean age: 31.8 [5.4]) were matched. After adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, arterial, venous, oncologic and gynecological history, obesity, use of smoking cessation drugs and the matching variables, having a 52 mg LNG IUS dispensation rather than a 19.5 mg one is associated with the use of antidepressant within the two years after dispensation (aOR ,"" 1.13 [1.05-1.22], p < 0.001) but not significantly with the use of anxiolytics (aOR "","" 1.05 [0.99-1.12], p "", 0.12) and hypnotics (aOR ,"" 1.09 [0.99-1.19], p "","" 0.07).

1105,"Background: Nearly 70% of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) use five or more medications concurrently, including prescription opioids for pain management. However, the safety of drug combinations involving opioids has not been evaluated with respect to fall or fracture risk. Objectives: To identify medications that may increase the risk of falls or fractures in RA patients taking prescription opioids continuously for at least 90 days. Methods: We used a case-crossover design to screen two commercial claims and Medicare databases (2003 to 2020). This approach selects RA patients who had a fall or fracture while on opioids and assesses exposure to non-opioid medications during a hazard window (days 130 before the event) and referent window (days 61-90 before the event). RA patients aged 18 years or older (65 years or older in Medicare) were required to have at least 365 days of continuous enrollment and at least 90 days of continuous prescription opioid use before a fall or fracture. We quantified the association between each drug pair and outcome using the odds ratio (OR). We also incorporated a control group of patients who experienced fall or fracture without opioid use in the prior 90 days to account for potential confounding by indication in a case-case-time-control analysis. We further limited analyzes to drug pairs with at least 500 individuals for sufficient statistical power. Results were evaluated in order of ascending p-value, and the false discovery rate (FDR) was used to adjust for multiple testing.

Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of OP medications on fracture risk in real-world settings. Methods: A cohort study was conducted using data of the French nationwide claims database, the SNDS, including all women 55 years, initiating an OP medication (i.e., denosumab, zoledronic acid (ZA), oral bisphosphonates (OBis), estrogens, teriparatide and raloxifene) between 2014 and 2016 according to a hierarchical approach that follows the relative order of drugs commercialization in France. Included patients were treated for 6 months, and followed up to 2 years. Fracture risk was estimated within treatment cohorts, comparing incidence rates between the 3 months following index date (baseline fracture risk) and the subsequent 12, 18, and 24 months. Results of the ""as treated"" own-control analysis are presented in terms of Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) and 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI).

1116,"Background: Oral combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) are commonly used worldwide, but their efficacy may diminish due to concomitant CYP3A4 inducers. Different progestins in CHCs vary regarding fraction metabolized by CYP3A4 (fmCYP3A4) and may have different efficacy reductions by such potential drug-drug interactions (DDI). Objectives: To compare the risk of CHC failure, that is, unintended pregnancy, in concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducer antiepileptic drugs with CHCs containing levonorgestrel (LNG, low fmCYP3A4)) or drospirenone (DRSP, high fmCYP3A4) via real-world evidence (RWE) and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling approaches. Methods: Our RWE study used a retrospective cohort design to identify females of childbearing age (18-48) in MarketScan® Research Databases (2005-2018) who were diagnosed with epilepsy, personality, or depressive mood disorder. Patients entered the cohort if we observed concomitancy of CHCs with CYP3A4 inducer antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, or topiramate). We excluded patients with infertility or hormonal dysfunction diagnoses. Concomitant use was determined based on information available from pharmacy dispensing data. During follow-up, we operationalized contraception failure with our team's previously developed algorithm that uses pregnancyrelated diagnoses and procedures to characterize pregnancy start date, duration, and end date.

Lastly, we used PBPK simulations of DRSP and LNG administered alone or with carbamazepine to obtain drug exposure changes in scenarios of DDI. Ratios of drug exposure under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were used to create ratios of DDI versus non-DDI AUC (AUCR) to compare PK changes of the two drugs to our RWE analysis results. Results: We identified 17 039 subjects in the LNG cohort and 15 254 subjects in the DRSP cohort. Incidence rate ratios were 1.70 [1.09, 2.67] and 1.53 [0.94, 2.43] for the unadjusted and adjusted analyzes, respectively. PBPK simulations resulted in AUCRs of 0.41 and 0.47 for LNG and DRSP, respectively, resulting in an exposure ratio of 0.87 between the two drugs in DDI scenarios. Conclusions: Our translational approach showed consistent directions in the modeled PK mechanism and real-world contraception failure. While the magnitude of relative differences between progestins was not similar, a linear relationship between reduced AUC and contraception failure is unlikely and requires further investigation. *The first two authors contributed equally.",1.0,curve,True

Methods: Using longitudinal claims data from commercially insured patients in the US, we identified patients 18 years, who had a diagnosis of AD and filled a prescription for a topical therapy. Patients entered the cohort if they initiated a systemic therapy (dupilumab, cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) from March 2015 to February 2021, not having used any study drug during 1 year before.

1149,"Background: A substantial body of research discusses appropriate chemotherapy discontinuation at the end of life of older metastatic breast cancer patients. However, only a few studies investigate endocrine treatment use near death. Objectives: To establish how frequently endocrine treatment is continued to the end of life or initiated close to death in metastatic breast cancer patients in Sweden. Additionally, to identify patient characteristics associated with a higher likelihood of end-of-life endocrine treatment and late initiation. Methods: Longitudinal, retrospective cohort study of decedents, including all older women (aged 65 years) with hormone receptor positive (defined as ever use of endocrine treatment) metastatic breast cancer who died in Sweden, 2016-2020. We used national death certificate data individually linked to several national registries. Endocrine treatment exposure was identified based on the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical codes (subgroup level `L02'). Treatment initiation was defined as the dispensing of endocrine treatment during the last 3 months of life given no endocrine treatment during the prior nine months. Treatment continuation was defined as endocrine treatment dispensing during the last 3 months of life given previous use during the prior nine months. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to investigate characteristics associated with treatment initiation and continuation. Results: In total, 3149 (median age at death 78 years) were included in the study as hormone positive metastatic patients.

Older women, those with many comorbidities or concomitant CDK4/6 treatment also had higher odds. While those with chemotherapy treatment at the end of life or higher education had lower odds to continue endocrine treatment. Conclusions: One third continue and 8% of older women with metastatic breast cancer initiate endocrine treatments at the very last part of life, potentially past the point where treatment has a benefit.

After a median follow-up of 8 (interquartile range: 4, 16) months, SGLT2i were associated with a reduced risk of hypoglycemia compared with DPP-4i [HR 0.75 (0.68, 0.83); RD À3.21 (À4.29, À2.12)] and GLP-1RA [HR 0.90 (0.82, 0.98); RD À1.33 (À2.44, À0.23)]. Results stratified by baseline insulin use were similar to the overall cohort findings. In patients with baseline SU, the risk of hypoglycemia was lower in SGLT-2i versus DPP-4i [HR 0.57 (0.49, 0.65), RD À6.80 (À8.43, À5.16)], while in those without baseline SU, the association was attenuated towards the null [HR 0.90 (0.78, 1.02), RD À1.26 (À2.76, 0.25)].

The MSM and ITT analyzes also provided similar findings. Conclusions: The use of SGLT-2i was associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia relative to DPP-4i and GLP-1RA, mainly driven by the subgroup of patients using SU at baseline.

However, SGLT2i are known to increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a rare yet serious outcome. It remains unclear whether individual SGLT2i are associated with a differential risk of DKA. Objectives: The primary objective of this large population-based cohort study is to determine whether the use of dapagliflozin or empagliflozin is associated with the risk of DKA compared with the use of canagliflozin. The secondary objective was to determine molecule-specific effects compared to an external comparison of dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, or sitaglipin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor. Methods: Using 3 US healthcare claims databases (Optum Clinformatics Data Mart Database, IBM MarketScan and Medicare fee-forservice) from January 2014 to June 2021, we assembled 3 cohorts of adults with type 2 diabetes. For cohort 1, we considered patients initiating individual SGLT2i (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) for a within-class comparison of SGLT2i. For cohort 2, we considered patients initiating the first of either an SGLT2i or dulaglutide (out of class comparison (#1). For cohort 3, we considered patients initiating the first of either an SGLT2i or sitagliptin (out of class comparison (#2).

1196,"Background: The association between antidepressants and type 2 diabetes has been controversial due to the bidirectional association of depression and type 2 diabetes. Recently large population-based studies from France and Japan and meta-analyzes have reported significantly increased risk despite adjusting for depression. Objectives: To investigate the association between antidepressant initiation and incident type 2 diabetes in different age-groups. Methods: We performed a cohort study in 1 million random sample of the Danish population, based on national registries. New-users of antidepressants were identified from 2001 to 2015 and 1:4 matched to controls on age, sex, and index date. The outcome was incident type 2 diabetes or oral glucose-lowering drugs. All analyzes were agestratified as young-middle aged (18-64 years) and older adults (65 years). Intention-to treat analysis with a follow-up of 5 years, and an analysis with time-dependent exposure status (current: 0-120, recent: 121-365 or past: >365 days) was conducted. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for potential confounders, including somatic and psychiatric comorbidities and comedications. Results: The age-sex matched cohort comprised of 117 691 antidepressant users and 470 764 controls. In the <65 age-group, the incidence rate (IR) of type 2 diabetes in antidepressant users and controls was 5 per 1000 person-years (PY) and 3.2 per 1000 PY, respectively, corresponding to an unadjusted HR of 1.57 (1.50-1.64) and adjusted HR (aHR) of 1.29 (1.221.36) in 5-year follow-up. Whereas, among the 65 age group, IR was 9.2 and 8.6 per 1000 PY corresponding to an unadjusted HR of 1.07 (1.01-1.14) and aHR 0.97 (0.90-1.04). Finally, in the time-dependent exposure model, the aHR in <65 age group for current, recent and past use was 1.43 (1.30-1.56), 1.38 (1.20-1.60) and 1.17 (1.07-1.29). However, the aHR in the 65 age group, was 0.95 (0.86-1.06), 0.93 (0.76-1.14), and 1.00 (0.87-1.15).

Objectives: To assess the risk of preterm birth, small-for-gestationalage (SGA) at birth, and stillbirth after COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. Methods: We used provincial databases in Ontario, Canada to identify all live and stillbirths 20 weeks' gestation (birth registry), linked to COVID-19 vaccination data (vaccine registry) for May 1 to November 30, 2021. Using Cox regression, we estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for preterm birth (overall; spontaneous preterm birth; very preterm birth <32 weeks), SGA birth (<10th percentile), and stillbirth treating COVID-19 vaccination as a time-varying exposure. Models were adjusted for calendar time, COVID-19 illness, sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, and pregnancy-related factors. Results: Among 69 650 eligible births during the study period, 33 295 (47.8%) were born to individuals who had received 1 dose of COVID19 vaccine during pregnancy. The cumulative incidence of preterm birth was 6.5% among those who received 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy and 7.0% among unvaccinated.

Objectives: To determine whether risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination among people ages 18-39 years differs by mRNA vaccine product. Methods: As part of ongoing real-time COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring within the Vaccine Safety Datalink, myocarditis and pericarditis cases in patients 18-39-years-old were identified and characterized by medical record review. We updated previous risk estimates of myocarditis and pericarditis during days 0-7 (risk interval) versus days 22-42 (comparison interval) post-vaccination and conducted direct comparisons of risk for mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 during 0-7 days post-vaccination.

1240,"Background: Acute pyelonephritis (APN) is a severe infection of the upper urinary tract and renal parenchyma. Increasing comorbidity burden and antibiotic resistance along with improving diagnostics may contribute to heightening the risk of APN hospitalization. Yet, few population-based studies have described APN incidence over time and according to age groups. Objectives: To examine temporal changes in APN hospitalization rate in Denmark. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of changing coding practices and population demographics. Methods: A nationwide register-based cohort study including Danish patients hospitalized for APN during 2000-2018 (identified using a composite of International Classification of Diseases codes, 10th Revision). Diagnoses registered less than 30 days apart were considered a single hospitalization. Patients were characterized according to sex, age, year of diagnosis, comorbidity, and region of residence. We estimated annual sex- and age-standardized APN hospitalization rates per 10 000 person years with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and stratified by sex, age group, diagnosis code, and region of residence. Hospitalization rate for urinary tract infection and sepsis diagnoses were investigated to address concomitant changes. Results: We identified 61 439 APN hospitalizations in 52 479 patients (73.6% female). Median age at diagnosis was 28 years (IQR, 11-54) in female and 57 years (IQR, 8-73) in male patients. From 2000 to 2018, the sex- and age-standardized hospitalization rate per 10 000 person years increased from 6.4 (95% CI: 6.1-6.7) to 12.9 (95% CI: 12.5- 13.3) in the female population and from 2.6 (95% CI: 2.4-2.8) to 4.0 (95% CI: 3.8-4.3) in the male population.

1247,"Background: The safety of COVID-19 vaccines remains an important global public health priority. Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) is an important but very rare prothrombotic disorder that is a safety concern for some COVID-19 vaccines. Definitions of TTS have been published by the Brighton Collaboration and US CDC but have only been used for confirming individual cases. A few real-world data studies have evaluated patterns of co-occurrence of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia as a potentially sensitive and non-specific proxy for TTS in claims and electronic health record databases. Objectives: To assess the incidence of co-occurrence of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TWT) diagnosis codes prior to the pandemic using the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan, which covers >99% of the population of Taiwan and is linked to the Taiwan death registry. Methods: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study to estimate TWT rates over the 3-year-period prior to the SARS-COV-2 pandemic (2017-2019). TWT was defined as patients with newly diagnosed thrombosis (ICD-10 G43.6, I26, I60, I61, I62, I63, I67.6, I70.92, I74, I75, I80.2, I82, P91), and with co-occurrence of newly diagnosed thrombocytopenia (D69.3, D69.4, D69.5, D69.6) within a ±7-day period.

Objectives: To investigate an approach of representing clinical and administrative healthcare-related code systems using network analysis modularity. Methods: We used the MIMIC-III dataset, an open-source Intensive Care Unit (ICU) dataset to create a network in which ICD-9 codes are the nodes and the number of patients who had the same diagnoses represent the edges. We then applied network modularity with different resolution thresholds to generate 6 different sets of modules. Each set was used separately to represent ICD codes creating 6 different datasets. These modules represent comorbidities occurring in the dataset. We implemented Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with non-linear kernel and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) to compare the performance of predicting 90-days ICU readmission between (1) the raw dataset, (2) 6 sets of modules' representations, (3) representing ICD codes using single-level Clinical Classification Software (CCS), and (4) truncated ICD codes to their highest level of hierarchy. The same methodology was applied to encoding DRG codes comparing only one set of modules to the raw dataset. Accuracy, AUC, F1-score were used to evaluate performance. Results: ICD codes: Different encoding approaches performed almost the same compared to encoding the raw dataset both in LR and GBM (AUC ranged from 80% to 81% in LR, 83%-84% in GBM), while they performed better in SVC (with highest AUC 85% vs. 82% in the raw dataset).

Objectives: To develop an ICH prediction tool and compare its performance versus Homer fall risk score in older adults taking oral anticoagulant (OAC) for predicting risk of ICH in patients with AF. Methods: We used the US Medicare claims data to identify new users of OAC (warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) aged 65 years with a diagnosis for non-valvular AF in the preceding 365 days from 10/19/2010 to 12/31/2017. We used patients from the Midwestern US as the validation set and used patients from all other US regions as the training set for the model development. We used Lasso regression with 10-fold cross-validation to select among 93 predictors based on literature to predict 1-year risk of ICH. We compared the prediction performance with versus without accounting for censoring due to death by inverse probability censoring weighting (IPCW) based on 95 covariates. We compared Homer score versus new AF ICH risk score in terms of Area under ROC curve (AUC) and reclassification, which measures performance of different scores in classifying patients into multiple risk groups.

We applied some of the best-performing, ITR-identifying, precision-medicine methods to a heart failure (HF) setting. Torsemide and bumetanide have superior pharmacokinetic profiles compared to furosemide, but which sub-populations benefit the most from superior profiles remains unclear. Objectives: To identify an optimal ITR for loop diuretic choice at HF hospitalization discharge, and to compare outcomes under this rule with outcomes under a one-treatment-for-all rule. Methods: We identified Medicare beneficiaries who were new users of furosemide, torsemide or bumetanide from 2007 to 2017, with an inpatient admission for HF. We excluded users with a loop diuretic in the six months prior to index HF hospitalization. Baseline covariates included patient demographics, comorbidities, concurrent medications, and dose equivalencies. Propensity scores were generated using a subset of baseline covariates identified using random forests (RF). Outcomes included all-cause mortality or a composite outcome of allcause mortality and HF readmission at multiple time points. We compared the optimized reward (number of days until outcome) under a one-treatment-for-all rule and an ITR identified from three precisionmedicine methods to identify optimal treatment rules: efficient augmented relaxation learning (EARL), residual weighted learning (RWL), and RF. Using these methods, we estimated the optimized reward for both the ITR and a one-treatment-for-all rule, and calculated the difference in optimized reward between the two approaches.

1292,"Background: While traditional Adverse Event (AE) reporting systems are slow to adapt on online AE reporting from patients, the number of patients using social media to share their experiences with vaccines is increasing. As global mass COVID-19 vaccination campaigns are ongoing, social media using artificial intelligence (AI)/natural language processing (NLP) is an important way to monitor AEs. Objectives: To monitor AE shared in social media by those who received COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: An AI powered NLP web app was developed to analyze web content (social media, and patient blogs and forums excluding press release) from 190 countries in 61 languages for mentions of COVID-19 vaccine related keywords. Following machine translation to English, lay language safety terms are detected using PubmedBERT based named-entity recognition model (precision ,"" 0.76, recall "","" 0.82) which are mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms using knowledge graphs. Insights were then generated using weekly and cumulative aggregated counts, proportions, and ratios. Visual analytics as word clouds, tabulations, and line graphs were used to analyze across periods any trending by vaccine brand, mechanism, country and MedDRA terms level (PT, HLT, and SOC). Results: Selected AE examples found using the app were consistent with those communicated shortly before or concomitantly by different Health Authorities. Anaphylactic reactions started to trend midDecember 2020 (under HLT """"Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid responses"""") shortly after the introduction of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

However, the effects of NSAID exposure on birth weight and gestational age are not known. Objectives: We estimated associations between prenatal NSAID exposure and preterm birth and small for gestational age among women with autoimmune conditions. Methods: Participants were enrolled in the Mother to Baby cohort and had an autoimmune disorder and singleton live birth >20 weeks gestation (n ,"" 2003). We characterized self-reported NSAID exposure over gestation for timing, duration, and average daily dose. Outcomes were preterm birth (i.e., <37 weeks gestation) and small for gestational age (SGA; <10th percentile birth weight). We used Poisson regression to estimate associations between NSAID exposure and study outcomes adjusting for demographics, co-use of other medications (Model 1), and disease severity at baseline (Model 2). Secondarily, we considered the role of acetaminophen use by individually matching NSAID users to controls on cumulative dose of acetaminophen exposure. Results: Overall, 15% of women reported NSAID use in pregnancy, with most use in the first trimester. No NSAID use exposure variables were associated with risk of preterm birth. Any NSAID use was associated with 1.7 (95% CI 1.2, 2.5) times greater risk of SGA and this estimate was attenuated to 1.5 (95% CI 1.0, 2.3) after adjustment for baseline disease severity. All other NSAID exposure variables were associated with SGA with similar magnitude. After matching on acetaminophen exposure, associations between any NSAID use and preterm birth and SGA were 0.8 (95% CI 0.6, 1.4) and 1.8 (95% CI 1.1, 2.9).

1303,"Background: Many treatment adherence measures use pharmacy databases or claims using fill and refill interval data. Solely relying on fill data to measure adherence may result in equating perceived underutilization to patient non-adherence, and consequently ignores potential under-prescribing practices or other system challenges. For example, poor adherence has been reported for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) use in lupus pregnancy based on fill data-often interpreting no fills as evidence of non-adherence, while failing to consider what was ordered. Objectives: The main objective of this work is to demonstrate how incorporating medication order data, in combination with fill data, informs important discussions of adherence. Using both data sources, we quantified measured primary medication non-adherence in a cohort of lupus pregnancies. Methods: In a retrospective cohort of 419 pregnancies of patients with lupus from a large integrated healthcare system, we used data on new medication orders and corresponding fill data for HCQ (2011- 2020). New orders included past and never users. We calculated the proportion of new orders filled (and filled within 30 days) during pregnancy. For pregnancies with no new order, we identified those with refills that extended into pregnancy. We stratified by calendar year: 2011-2015, 2016-2019, and 2020 separately to account for COVID19-related HCQ shortages. Results: The overwhelming majority of patients filled their HCQ orders during pregnancy, most within 30 days of the order. Nearly 46% of pregnancies had a new order for HCQ and 93.2% were filled (83.3% filled 30d). In 2011-2015, 92.3% of new orders were filled (88.5% 30d), in 2016-2019 96.6% were filled (80.9% 30d), and fewer in 2020 (84.0% ever, 76.0% 30d). A considerable proportion of pregnancies without new orders for HCQ had refills before pregnancy that extended into pregnancy. During 2011-2015, 53% of pregnancies either had a new order or refill from a previous period, compared to 63.2% of 2016-2019 pregnancies, and 68.6% in 2020.

However, patients are at an increased risk of vertebral fractures shortly after delaying or discontinuing denosumab. Timely administration of denosumab injections every 6 months is thus critical. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated increase in virtual care may have impacted timeliness of denosumab therapy. Objectives: To estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the proportion of older adults who received on-time denosumab dispensations. Methods: We identified all denosumab dispensations submitted for remuneration to the Ontario government from 2012/02 to 2021/01. For each dispensation between 2015/07 and 2020/06, we calculated the proportion of surviving patients who received an on-time denosumab dispensation 183 ± 30 days later. Interrupted time series analysis using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modeling was used to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (starting 2020/03) on the proportion of patients who received on-time denosumab dispensations each month. Models were stratified by: (1) patient residence in community or long-term care (LTC), and (2) user type (first-time user, early user [2-3 prior dispensations], and established user [4 prior dispensations]). Results: We calculated on-time dispensing for 648 221 denosumab claims, 82 561 of which were dispensed in LTC. In the community, the pre-pandemic proportion of on-time dispensations was steady, yet differed across user types (first-time users: À65%, early users: À75%, established users: À80%). We identified an immediate decline in the proportion of on-time dispensations across all user types at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (À17.8% [95% CI: À19.6, À16.0]), and a 46% monthly increase after April 2020.

1314,"Background: Opioid prescribing has contributed to a North American epidemic with increasing trends in several European countries. Rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) are one of the most common indications for prescribed opioids despite little evidence on opioid prescribing and the benefit of long-term use in RMDs. Objectives: To investigate national UK opioid prescribing trends in new users with the six RMDs: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), osteoarthritis (OA) and fibromyalgia. Methods: Patients aged 18+ years with RMDs with a new episode of opioid use without cancer in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) were included between 01/01/2006 and 31/12/2020. CPRD is a database of anonymised UK primary care electronic health records representative of the national population. Age- and genderstandardized rates of new opioid users were obtained by dividing the number of new opioid users with an RMD per year by the number of eligible patients registered in CPRD per year and using direct standardization. Trends for the rates were tested using negative binomial regression. Significant change points were identified by looking at the points where the derivative (i.e., rate of change) of the trends for the rates crossed zero. Long-term opioid users were defined as patients who had 3+ opioid prescriptions issued within a 90-day period, or 90+ days opioid supply, in the first year of follow-up, not including the first 30 days after a new opioid episode. Results: This study included 21505 RA patients, 8392 PsA patients, 4491 AxSpA patients, 4508 SLE patients, 944078 OA patients, and 33829 fibromyalgia patients, who had new opioid episodes between 2006 and 2020. Whilst overall trends for RA (2.7* vs. 3.9*), PsA (1.0* vs. 1.8*) and fibromyalgia (3.7* vs. 8.3*) has significantly increased over 15 years, from 2018 onwards, trends of new opioid users appeared to stabilize/decrease.

Heart failure (HF) is still one of the cardiovascular problems in Indonesia due to the high rate of morbidity, mortality, and rehospitalization. PARADIGM-HF trial in 2014 showed that, compared with enalapril, sacubitril/valsartan was associated with a significant reduction in mortality and reduced risk of hospitalization for patients who had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Sacubitril/valsartan has been included in the Indonesia National Formulary for the treatment of HFrEF since 2021 Objectives: Sacubitril/valsartan, a dual-acting angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi), is an innovative treatment for HF in patients with HFrEF. This study aimed to analyze the costeffectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan for the treatment of chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in Indonesia. Methods: This economic evaluation considers the cost-effectiveness of intervention of sacubitril/valsartan in addition to standard care versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in addition to standard care in the treatment of HFrEF.

Moreover, little is known about the evidence of adherence in the intensive phase or early-stage treatment phase, which is at higher risk of transmission, and its impact on mortality. Objectives: To investigate the level of early-stage nonadherence in the intensive phase, its risk factors, and its association with mortality in patients with drug-susceptible TB. Methods: We conducted a nationwide cohort study by linking the Korean National Tuberculosis Surveillance System Database and the National Health Information Database. We included all incident patients with incident drug-susceptible TB, who started the recommended regimen by the World Health Organization, between 2013 and 2018. The early-stage adherence during the intensive phase (within 60 days after the start date of the regimen) was measured using the proportion of days covered (PDC). We categorized patients based on levels of adherence as poor (PDC < 50%), moderate (50% to 79%), high (80%) adherent groups. We investigated risk factors of early-stage adherence using multinomial logistic regression model.

Although the difference in absolute risk of mortality by early-stage nonadherence was small, subgroup analyzes showed the risk of mortality was heterogenous according to age group, sex, and economic status. Conclusions: We found aged population, medical aid beneficial, and patients with renal failure disease and diabetes were less likely to adhere to the regimen in the intensive phase. Early-stage nonadherence was associated with a higher risk of mortality, and the risk was particularly most evident in younger, male, and low-income patients.

Objectives: The main objective of this study is to decipher the association of Sacubitril/Valsartan with hypoacusis by disproportionality analysis in US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: The FAERS data from July 2015 to September 2020 was leveraged to explore the association of Sacubitril/Valsartan with hypoacusis. Disproportionality analysis was performed considering Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A value of PRR 2.0 with a Chisquared test statistic of 4.0, at least three reports (n  3) of that preferred term (PT) and ROR-1.96 SE > 1 is considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 20 760 reports pertinent to hypoacusis were extracted from FDA database. Out of which, 841 (4.05%) reports revealed association with Sacubitril/Valsartan.

Objectives: To detect the possible safety signal of triazole antifungals associated with acute pancreatitis through disproportionality analysis in FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) Database. Methods: The case/non-case retrospective disproportionality analysis was performed in a publicly available FAERS database using Open Vigil 2.1(2004Q1-2021Q3). The preferred term used for the study was ""Pancreatitis Acute"" and the drugs included in the analysis were posaconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, and clotrimazole. Proportional reporting ratio (PRR) and Reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used as the data-mining algorithm for the analysis.

Randomized control trials reported improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms among patients with psoriasis receiving tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and ustekinumab (TNFi/ UST) versus placebo and conventional systemic agents (CSA). However, the risk of DAAD among TNFi/UST versus CSA users was not assessed in real-world settings. Objectives: we aimed to examine the incidence of DAAD among patients with psoriasis treated with TNFi/UST versus CSA Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the province of Quebec health administrative databases (1997-2015). Among adult patients with a diagnosis for psoriasis and initiating a CSA, we included those who later initiated a TNFi/UST at the date of their first prescription fill (index-date). We also included TNFi/UST non-users at a date chosen to match the time between the first CSA and the indexdate of a random TNFi/UST user using prescription-time distribution matching to reduce survival bias. TNFi/UST non-users were classified into current or previous CSA users according to their last CSA received at or before their index-date. Follow-up ended at the first date of DAAD diagnosis entry, death, or end of the study period. The first healthcare use for DAAD in follow-up defined incident DAAD. We considered a 3-month latency period to ensure that theses DAAD occurred after index date. Marginal Cox regression models weighted by the inverse adjusted probability of exposure (propensity score) compared the risk of DAAD between TNFi/UST, current and previous CSA users. Additional analyzes were conducted by age groups and sex. Results: The study cohort included 1333 patients with psoriasis: 183 TNFi/UST users, 625 current CSA users and 525 previous CSA users. Rates of DAAD were 63.3, 55.6 and 33.5 per 1000 person-year, respectively. TNFi/UST users were at lower risk of DAAD versus previous CSA users (Hazard Ratio 0.48, 95% CI: 0.28-0.94). The reduction in risk among TNFi/UST users was not statistically significant versus current CSA users. Similar results were observed across different age groups and sex. Conclusions: Among patients with psoriasis, the use of TNFi/UST compared to CSA may be associated with reduced risk of DAAD. It is reassuring that the risk of DAAD was not higher in TNFi/UST users",1.0,trial,True

Objectives: To estimate the risk of inpatient constipation among migraine patients prescribed anti-CGRP pathway mAbs and standard of care anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Methods: Within the Optum Electronic Health Record Research Database, patients with migraine who initiated erenumab, other anti-CGRP pathway mAbs, and AEDs (carbamazepine, gabapentin, topiramate, valproate sodium/valproic acid/divalproex sodium, zonisamide) were identified from May 2018 through March 2020. Erenumab initiators were propensity score-matched separately to initiators of other mAbs and AEDs. Inpatient constipation was defined as constipation (ICD10-CM code K59.0-) recorded during an emergency department or inpatient visit. Incident inpatient constipation events within 90 days following treatment initiation were identified among patients who initiated treatment by 31 December 2019 (to ensure patients had the requisite follow-up time). Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated comparing risk of inpatient constipation among propensity-score matched erenumab initiators relative to propensity-score matched comparators. Results: We identified 15 983 erenumab, 11 345 other mAb, and 43 810 AED initiators who met study criteria and initiated treatment between 17 May 2018 and 31 December 2019. Among matched initiators, inpatient constipation risk was 0.46% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.35-0.60) for erenumab and 0.44% (95% CI: 0.33-0.58) for other mAbs, with a corresponding OR of 1.06 (95% CI: 0.72-1.55).

Among nAMD patients, those receiving aflibercept had lower risk of TAEs (adjusted hazard ratio, HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.770.94) compared to those receiving ranibizumab. However, among DME patients, those receiving aflibercept had no differences in the risk of TAEs (1.14; 0.97- 1.35), compared to those receiving ranibizumab. Among patients treated with ranibizumab, the DME group had higher risk of TAEs than the nAMD group (HR: 1.15; 95% CI, 1.03-1.28); similar results were observed in patients treated with aflibercept (HR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.27- 1.85). When DME patients were treated with aflibercept, the risk of TAEs was 31% higher than when nAMD patients were treated with ranibizumab (HR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.09-1.56, p < 0.05). The p-value for statistical interaction between the anti-VEGF treatment and indications was 0.0033. Conclusions: Patients treated with aflibercept or ranibizumab for different indications may be associated with varying risk of TAEs.

1393,"Background: On September 5 2019, British Columbia's public drug plan program changed its coverage policy to switch patients treated with originator infliximab for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) to an infliximab biosimilar. Objectives: To monitor the impacts of the British Columbia policy on health services utilization during the first year of the policy. Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study using administrative data from British Columbia. We constructed 3 historical cohorts and 1 policy cohort of users of originator infliximab with IBD. We excluded users not covered by the provincial drug plan. We monitored the cumulative incidence of prescription refills for immunomodulatory drugs, switching to other biologic medications, and the use of additional health services. Log-likelihood ratios were used to quantify differences between the policy cohort and the average of the historical cohorts. Results: The market share of biosimilars increased among patients with IBD during the first year of the policy: from 10% to 82% of infliximab prescriptions in adults, and from 1% to 97% in children. The cohorts included 1839-2368 users of infliximab originator, ages 4- 90 years, mean age 43 years. The major findings during the first year of follow-up were: (1) a 0.9% increase in refilling infliximab, biosimilar or originator; (2) a 16% increase in dose escalation; (3) decreases of 2.4% in antibiotic filling and 2.6% in prednisone use; (4) an anticipated increase in visits to physicians and gastroenterologists to manage switching to biosimilars (24%); (5) a 4% decrease in discharge from hospital; and (6) a 3% decrease in emergency admission to hospital. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest British Columbia's Biosimilars Initiative for non-medical switching from originator to biosimilar infliximab for IBD was not associated with increased health services utilization, which served also as proxies for patient health. An increase in dose escalation was accompanied by an improvement in health status proxies.",1.0,disease,True

Objectives: To assess the biosimilar penetration rate in TNF-alpha inhibitors newly initiating patients and prevalent users from the date of first biosimilar commercialization, overall and according to the pathology treated, the physician specialty and patient characteristics. Methods: Using data of the French National Health Data System (SNDS), infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab adult new users and adult prevalent users from the date of commercialization in France of the first biosimilar of these respective molecules (i.e., January 2015, May 2016, and October 2018) were included in the study. Patients were followed until September 30, 2021 in a longitudinal approach. Patient socio-demographic characteristics, underlying pathologies and switch pathways were analyzed descriptively. Results: A 207 118 patients were included in the study. Respectively 25 950, 27 727, 48 768 infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab initiating patients were included. Biosimilars represented 78%, 46%, and 53% of the overall initiations of the 3 molecules, and 94%, 66%, and 60% during the last year of follow-up. Respectively 20 254, 31 038, 53 381 of originator infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab prevalent users were included in the study. A total of 46%, 19% and 17% had switched at least once for a biosimilar at the end of the study. Biosimilar penetration rate was much higher for infliximab than for its counterparts. Biosimilar initiation and originator-to-biosimilar switch tended to be observed more in rheumatology than in the other specialties. Biosimilar use was consistent across patient characteristics such as age, sex, deprivation, and medical history. Conclusions: Biosimilar initiation rate increased rapidly from their market arrival and originator-to-biosimilar switch rate remained moderate, highlighting the need and usefulness of political action and biosimilar use tracking. Overall, biosimilar use depended mostly of the considered molecule (infliximab hospital delivery boosting biosimilar utilization) and of the specialty of the prescriber (with a faster biosimilar adoption by rheumatologists relatively to gastro-enterologists and dermatologists).",0.0,,False

Changes in treatment were defined as (1) ""cycling"" from one TNFi to another and (2) ""switching"" from a TNFi to a non-TNFi bDMARD or tsDMARD within 12-months after TNFi initiation. A Bayesian methodology with an ensemble approach examined a network of at least 128 predictive models. A 80% of patients were used to train our model; 20% were used to validate the model. Results: Among 24 871 patients with RA who initiated a TNFi as their first line b/tsDMARD, mean age was 55.5 years, 77% were female, and the most common initiated TNFi was adalimumab (42%). During the 1-year follow-up, 3870 patients (16%) cycled to another TNFi and 2426 patients (10%) switched to another drug type. At baseline, compared to switchers, cyclers were 2.5 years younger on average, slightly more likely to be male and Asian, and more likely to have 1 comorbidity, but less likely to have 4 comorbidities. At baseline, cyclers also were more likely to be treated with an antimetabolite, folate, or a soluble TNF receptor agent, and less likely to be treated with an inflammatory bowel agent. Cyclers and switchers had similar use of procedures, hospitalizations, ER visits, and outpatient visits. Factors that increased the likelihood of switching to another drug type were high non-rheumatic Charlson Comorbidity Index score, receiving cancer chemotherapy, and C-Reactive Protein being abnormal or not performed. Factors that increased the likelihood of TNFi cycling included having psoriasis. Model AUC on training data was 0.624; AUC on the validation dataset was 0.611. Conclusions: ML methods can be leveraged to address questions in Pharmacoepidemiology using real-world data. It provides improved sampling of the modeling space (including interactions among variables) and increases model predictive power. The approach also amplifies relationships best supported by the data and downplays spurious associations. However, predicting treatment changes remains challenging even with novel methodological approaches, as unmeasured factors (such as prescriber's preference or patient's beliefs) remain key determinants of change.",1.0,disease,True

Methods: Using Danish national registries, the nation-wide study included individuals diagnosed with CD or UC who were biologicnaïve when initiating treatment with Infliximab (IFX), Adalimumab (ADA), Vedolizumab (VDZ), Golimumab (GOL), or Ustekinumab (UST) during years 2015-2020. The hazard ratios (HR) of switching or discontinuing biologic were explored using Cox regression adjusted for health-related and socio-economic parameters at treatment initiation. Results: Among 3016 CD patients and 3014 UC patients, IFX was used as first line biologic treatment in 86% (2579) of CD patients and 89% (2688) of UC patients. This was followed by ADA with 12% (354), VDZ with 2% (73) and UST with 0.3% (10) for CD patients, and ADA with 6% (186), VDZ with 3% (98) and GOL with 1% (40) for the UC patients. Compared to IFX as first-line treatment, initiators of ADA had a higher risk of discontinuation among CD patients (HR: 1.96 (95% confidence interval: 1.61; 2.38)) and among UC patients (2.15 (1.69; 2.74)), whereas initiators of VDZ had a lower risk of discontinuation among CD patients (HR: 0.58 (0.32; 1.04)) and among UC patients (0.48 (0.28; 0.84)). Analyzes of GOL and UST were impaired due to few events. In total, 43% (1292) of CD patients and 43% (1291) of UC patients started a second line biologic treatment, while 19% (587) of CD patients and 19% (564) of UC patients started a third line biologic treatment. Only 9% (273) of CD patients and 9% (277) of UC patients proceeded to fourth line biologic treatment. No difference in risk of switch in biologic treatment was observed comparing the first-line biologics. Conclusions: More than 85% of CD and UC patients initiating biologic therapy had IFX as their first-line biologic treatment, which is recommended by the official treatment guidelines. The reason for deviation from treatment guidelines or switch in therapy should be explored in further studies as well as the higher incidence of treatment discontinuation for ADA as first-line treatment.",1.0,,True
1412,"Methods: A list of oncology drug approvals between 2015 and 2020 were identified through review of FDA and EMA annual reports. Publicly available regulatory review documents were screened to extract information on clinical context, evidence, and additional B-R considerations. Results were stratified by agency, year, orphan designation, and review type. Results: Data were extracted from 233 regulatory reviews including 64 new EMA submissions (39 orphan and 25 non-orphan indications) and 70 new FDA submissions (35 orphan and 35 non-orphan indications). In 2015, there were few reviews (32%) with EMA effects tables or FDA B-R tables, compared with 93% each year starting in 2017. Among new submissions, there were notable differences between agencies, with FDA approvals more frequently based on single-arm trial evidence (orphan [54% vs. 40%] and non-orphan [40% vs. 21%] indications) and conducted as accelerated/priority reviews (orphan [83% vs. 60%] and non-orphan [71% vs. 13%] indications) than EMA, respectively. EMA more commonly based decisions on overall survival data (orphan [84% vs. 40%] and non-orphan [54% vs. 37%] indications) than FDA. For EMA and FDA, respectively, few assessments included quality of life data (9.4% vs. 0%), patient experience data (7.8% vs. 8.6%), or real-world data (1% vs. 0%). No assessments included results of quantitative B-R assessments. EMA more often granted marketing authorization without conditions (orphan [60% vs. 9%] and non-orphan [69% vs. 51%] indications) than FDA, with a requirement to conduct post-authorization studies more often required by FDA (64%, N ,"" 45) than EMA (41%, N "","" 26). Data were also extracted from 99 EMA label extension submissions; with no reviews of label extensions reported by FDA (which is common practice) for comparison. Conclusions: Differences in B-R assessments by regulators can inform early planning by sponsors to address multiple health authority needs. Notably, while both agencies have public policy targets of extending their use of patient experience data and real-world data these are still being rarely applied in regulatory B-R assessment of oncology drugs.""",1.0,clinical,True

Methods: Using a probabilistic model to account for differential vaccine effectiveness and temporal differences in disease dynamics, the benefit of different vaccines in the European Economic Area (EEA) were calculated by comparing the observed number of confirmed cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths (source ECDC) with the expected number of these events, had no COVID-19 vaccines been available. Risks of myocarditis, pericarditis and TTS associated with the vaccines was evaluated by comparing the observed risk events (source EudraVigilance) to the expected events based on background incidence rates (source EMA). Results: The vaccines under study had comparable benefits, but magnitude differed by age group, gender, and vaccine product. When relying on published vaccine effectiveness estimates, the benefit of vaccination was estimated by the prevention of 13 322 567 confirmed COVID-19 infections, 933 230 COVID-19 hospitalizations, 150 106 ICU admissions and 220 880 COVID-19 related deaths in the EEA, since the start of vaccination. While there was an increased risk of myocarditis in the male population <40 years of age after Spikevax vaccination, the vaccine prevented substantial COVID-19 hospitalizations in this population. Both the number of clinical benefits, as well as the risk of TTS after Vaxzevria vaccination were the highest in the 60 to 69 years of age category, with benefits outweighing the risk. Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates that the benefits of COVID19 vaccination far outweigh the myocarditis, pericarditis, and TTS risks. Rare, life-threatening side effects associated with vaccination might not be observed in a clinical trial and should be investigated as soon as possible after introduction of vaccines into large populations. The proposed methodology can be applied to any serious adverse event that may occur in the future or other vaccines.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Objectives: A structured benefit risk assessment (sBRA) was undertaken to compare the benefit risk (BR) profile of enoxaparin with other EU indicated LMWHs for the indication of extended treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and prevention of its recurrence in patients with active cancer. Methods: The following steps of the sBRA framework were applied: decision context, determination of key benefit and risk outcomes, identification of data sources and adequate data extraction. The only study to compare enoxaparin to other LMWHs was the observational study RIETECAT based on RIETE international registry of VTE patients. The data presentation is based on value tree and forest plot - representing the adjusted hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for benefits and risks of enoxaparin versus other EU indicated LMWHs. Results: The most clinically important benefits are the reduction in VTE recurrence and the reduction in all-cause mortality. ""Major bleedings and minor bleedings events"" are the most clinically important risks for this analysis. Regarding benefits, the comparison of enoxaparin with other EU indicated LMWHs showed a trend with favorable effects for enoxaparin for the reduction of VTE recurrence and the reduction in all-cause mortality, but no statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups. Regarding risks, the effect for major bleedings tended to be in favor of other LMWHs. For non-major bleeding, results tended to show a favorable effect for enoxaparin. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Conclusions: The sBRA facilitates the identification of critical issues and improves transparency of the assumptions used to evaluate the BR profile of a product.

In the PDM algorithm, a likelihood ratio was calculated which compared each scenario to the null hypothesis of no treatment efficacy. Likelihoods in the likelihood ratios were calculated assuming a normal probability model for the natural logarithm of the hazard ratio.

Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study using the IQVIA Medical Research Data (IMRD)-UK data (formally known as THIN database). All male patients with their first HF diagnosis between 2004 and 2019 were identified using the Read Codes from the diagnostic records. The MRA use was ascertained by the first prescription records after the HF diagnosis and was classified into spironolactone and eplerenone. Patients entered the study at the first HF diagnosis and the follow-up was split into three-month intervals. Using a marginal structural model approach, time-varying confounders associated with time-varying exposure and outcome were adjusted, and pooled logistic regression models with robust variance estimator were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of prostate cancer risk.

1496,"Background: Macrolide antibiotics treat a variety of infections but have a risk of treatment failure related bacterial resistance as a result of both prolonged sub- and supratherapeutic exposure. Objectives: We characterized the rate of macrolide antibiotic treatment failure and quantified the influence of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) on antibacterial treatment failure rates. Methods: This was a nested case-control study using the IBM MarketScan data (2004-2015). Two study cohorts were developed: an acute infections cohort and a bacteria-specific pneumonia cohort. Patients were included if they had a macrolide (erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin) fill within five days of diagnosis, were <65 years old, and had health coverage for 12 months prior and 60 days after diagnosis. Patients were excluded with a hospitalization within 30 days or an infection within 6 months prior to index date, a previous antibiotic claim 30 days prior to index date, or an immunocompromising disorder. Case-control pairs were matched 1:1 without replacement using incidence density sampling on the following: age, sex, and infection year, number of comedications, macrolide received, macrolide dose, and comorbidity score. DDI covariates were based on CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers where macrolide exposures either increase or decrease significantly; mild DDI (25%-49% exposure change) or moderate DDI (50% exposure change). Analyzes include calculation of the treatment failure rates, that is, macrolide therapy didn't eradicate the infection, and conditional logistic regression. Results: The common infection cohort consisted of 135 683 casecontrol pairs, while the bacteria-specific cohort consisted of 1115 pairs. Azithromycin was the most prescribed macrolide. The overall rate of treatment failure was 5.7% and 7.7% in the common infection cohort and bacteria-specific cohort, respectively. For the common infection cohort, the odds ratio for treatment failure was not influenced by mild AUC changes, but was for moderate macrolide AUC decrease (1.37 [1.02, 1.86]) and moderate AUC increase (1.12 [1.08,",1.0,flu,True

1503,"Background: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been widely adopted as an alternative to warfarin in prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Treatment guidelines for AF are based on results of randomized controlled trials (RCT) for DOACs. There is uncertainty on the applicability of RCT results to patient groups excluded from the trials. Objectives: To use eligibility criteria and baseline patient characteristics from ARISTOTLE, the pivotal RCT for the DOAC apixaban, to construct a trial-analogous cohort of patients in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). To compare results in this trial-analogous cohort with the RCT to validate non-interventional methods for assessing treatment effectiveness in stroke prevention in AF. Methods: ARISTOTLE eligibility criteria were applied to AF patients in CPRD Aurum prescribed apixaban or warfarin between 1 Jan 2013 to 31 Jan 2020 (418 705 people; 144 495 HES-linked and trial-eligible). Apixaban patients were matched to the RCT apixaban arm on key baseline characteristics creating a trial-analogous apixaban arm; this arm was then matched 1:1 to warfarin CPRD patients using propensity score matching yielding a trial-analogous cohort of 8603 apixaban and 8603 warfarin patients. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze the ARISTOTLE efficacy outcomes of (1) stroke or systemic embolism and (2) death from any cause and results compared with the trial. Time in therapeutic range (TTR) was calculated using Rosendaal's method and treatment effectiveness further evaluated based on TTR. Results: Results in the CPRD trial-analogous cohort [HR (95% CI)] were consistent with the trial results in confirming non-inferiority of apixaban compared with warfarin for stroke or systemic embolism [CPRD 0.90 (0.75-1.09) vs. trial 0.79 (0.66-0.95)] and death from any cause [CPRD 0.77 (0.70-0.86) vs. trial 0.89 (0.80-0.99)].

Conclusions: Analysis of this non-interventional data generated results comparable to ARISTOTLE. The weaker treatment benefit observed overall in our cohort may be linked to the higher proportion of patients with well-controlled warfarin compared with the trial. The methodological template developed can be used to determine risks and benefits of AF treatments in people in CPRD who would have been excluded from ARISTOTLE.",1.0,trial,True

Objectives: To investigate whether the intake of vitamin D supplements is associated with reduced all-cause and cause-specific mortality in real-world settings, and to validate the associations of 25(OH)D levels with mortality outcomes. Methods: Setting: This prospective cohort study employed 445 601 UK Biobank population recruited between 2006 and 2010, after excluding those without available information on the use of vitamin D or multivitamin supplements, and those who had no measured 25(OH) D at baseline.

Serious adverse events (SAEs) were used as an indicator of possible safety considerations during trials with cardiovascular indication for chronic wounds conditions, and deviations were used to assess protocol adherence. Quality control in the execution phase of clinical trials is critical to producing high integrity data and helps achieve the study's objectives, particularly as biomedical research moves towards a risk based monitoring approach. Objectives: Monitor study protocol compliance and safety factors by tracking the rate of deviations and adverse events over time; Determine which factors affect study efficiency; Identify trends in deviations, adverse event occurrence and type; Establish correlation of wound etiology with specific safety concerns.

Objectives: The objective was to evaluate pexidartinib and the REMS program using the Benefit-Risk Assessment, Communication, and Evaluation (BRACE) framework. Methods: The application of the BRACE framework includes a cycle of five steps: benefit-risk evidence identification, evidence integration and analysis, decision-making, benefit-risk communication and risk minimization, and evaluation. These iterative phases were applied to the pexidartinib life cycle. Results: In the benefit-risk evidence identification phase, data from the phase III trial showed that pexidartinib was effective in the treatment of TGCT with improved patient functional outcomes and symptomatic relief, although there were reports of hepatic-related adverse events. Hepatotoxicity was identified as an important risk associated with pexidartinib use and was weighed against the potential benefit of the therapy (evidence integration and analysis).

East China is an economically developed area with a massive use of antibiotics and a high rate of antibiotic resistance (ABR). However, the profile of dietary exposure to antibiotics in humans has not been well explored. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the total intake level of antibiotics in human via foods and drinking water based on a community population in East China. Methods: This study recruited 600 local residents from 194 households in Deqing County of Zhejiang Province starting in June 2019. Each participant was asked to complete a food frequency questionnaire to report the daily consumption of animal-derived foods and drinking water. Tap water samples were collected from ten households and assessed for the presence of 21 antibiotics in five categories. Data on antibiotic residues in animal-derived foods were obtained from the notification of unqualified edible agricultural products after special supervision sampling inspection in Deqing County. The dietary exposure to antibiotics in humans were estimated by combining the data of antibiotic contamination in foods and drinking water, and the information of dietary consumption. Results: Participants were exposed to 16 of the 21 antibiotics evaluated, with the daily exposure estimates ranging from 15.1 g to 1128 g. The exposure varied greatly across antibiotics.

Methods: We compared the guidance for pediatric use in the EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and the US Prescription Information (USPI) on the level of indications granted as of March 2020 for novel medicinal products approved in both regions between 2010 and 2018. Results: The guidance for pediatric use differed for 18% (61/348) of the listed indications covering 21% (45/217) of the products, but without the guidance being contradictory. Where guidance differed, an equal share was observed for indications with a higher level of information for pediatric use in one region over the other (49% (30/61) in the US; 51% (31/61) in the EU). The discrepancies in pediatric information could be explained by differences in regulations for 21% (13/61) of the indications. Only a few conditions and diseases (EU n , 4; US n ,"" 1) were observed to cover potential pediatric use outside the approved adult indication. Conclusions: Although the EU Pediatric Regulation more often provides regulators a mandate for requiring pediatric drug development as compared to the US PREA, this was not reflected in the prescription information approved by the two regulatory authorities.""",1.0,disease,True

1549,"Background: Isotretinoin is a potent acne treatment but with severe teratogenic effects. Although the Saudi Food and Drug Authority approved and updated risk minimization measures to prevent fetal exposure over the years, the extent of fetal exposure to isotretinoin in Saudi Arabia is unknown. Objectives: To quantify fetal exposure to isotretinoin in Saudi Arabia using real-world data. Methods: We included 5888 women of childbearing age (WCBAs) who initiated isotretinoin between 2015 and 2020 using electronic health records from 3 healthcare institutions. Isotretinoin users were followed from first day of dispensing to 30 days post discontinuation, during which WCBAs must avoid pregnancy (risk period). WCBAs' characteristics were collected within 6 months before initiation of isotretinoin therapy including indications, comorbidities, and medication use. We defined pregnancy as any positive pregnancy test (urine or serum) or any diagnosis or procedure related to pregnancy. The fetal exposure was quantified, as the total number of pregnancies during the risk period divided by total number of WCBA's included in the study. Moreover, to quantify adherence to risk minimization measures, we estimated contraceptive use (oral or intrauterine contraceptives) and pregnancy test (serum or urine) in the study cohort from the period prior to isotretinoin initiation until one month after therapy ended. Results: Adolescents comprised 28% of the sample and 80% were younger than 30 years old. Asthma (4%), hypothyroidism (3%), and polycystic ovary syndrome (6%) were the most prevalent medical diagnosis identified. Previous acne treatments included antibiotics and tretinoins; however, the majority (60%) were not treated with any acne treatment before isotretinoin initiation. Only 5% of WCBAs received at least one prescription of contraceptives. Most WCBA isotretinoin users (90%) were not tested for pregnancy before initiating isotretinoin. We identified 22 confirmed pregnancies (4.5 per 1000 WCBAs isotretinoin users). After adding suspected cases, the pregnancy risk was 9.5 per 1000. Conclusions: Although risk minimization measures exist in Saudi Arabia, considerable fetal exposure to isotretinoin occurred. Continuous evaluation of risk minimization measures is imperative to identify potential improvements to the system to prevent fetal exposure. Our study sets a baseline to examine the effectiveness of future updates of precautionary measures concerning isotretinoin use.",1.0,positive,True

Objectives: The goal was to have a framework to document and assess the research impact of CNODES. Methods: We used a theory-driven developmental evaluation approach as CNODES is a large, geographically dispersed research network with many stakeholders, and it exists in a changing drug regulatory and policy environment. Our utilization-focused approach takes into consideration diverse perspectives and intended uses of the assessment. We used the Theoretical Domains Framework version 2, with 14 domains. We analyzed the bibliometric and altmetric data for 95 CNODES publications. Results: Our outputs included a Logic Model and Theory of Change to guide CNODES research impact assessment. These outputs (1) identified research impact activities and outputs; (2) identified reach, including key academic and government stakeholders; (3) used the Theoretical Domains Framework to identify assumptions related to stakeholders' use of CNODES research; and (4) identified examples of desired behavior changes/changes in practice; for example, decisionmakers rely on and use CNODES evidence to help inform drug safety and effectiveness policies and practices. Using this framework, we adapted bibliometric and altimetric tools to document research impact. One citation indicator showed that 24% of CNODES publications are among the top 5% most cited in their field, with the average download per publication being 35 003 (IQR 8043-45 047). Conclusions: CNODES developed a logic model, theory of change, and evaluation matrix to guide integration of research impact assessment into the CNODES research process. CNODES identified stakeholders and considered their capacity, opportunity, and motivation for using CNODES research to inform decisions. CNODES used bibliometrics, altmetrics, media analysis, and authorship gender analysis to assist with impact documentation and is now automating these processes. These approaches provide for the ongoing assessment of ways in which CNODES research is being used by diverse stakeholder groups.

Objectives: To compare the top 10 teratogenic drugs with prenatal exposure among publicly and privately insured pregnant persons. Methods: We used US national 2013 IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Claims Databases and Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) Databases to identify pregnancy episodes among persons aged 12 to 55 years. Since pregnancy outcomes, conception, and pregnancy end dates are not directly recorded in claims data, we adapted previously validated algorithms to define pregnancy endpoints and gestation period. Teratogens were selected from the Teratogen Information System and Clinical Pharmacology based on the risk level and evidence quality. Those with the highest risk level and evidence quality were classified as definite teratogens (140 drugs) and those with possible risk as potential (60). Sex hormones, hormone analogs, abortion, and postpartum hemorrhage treatments were not considered due to challenges separating pregnancy-related indications, nor were opioids (due to complicated risk-benefit) and anti-obesity drugs (mechanism of harm related to weight loss). We defined prenatal exposure based on 1 outpatient pharmacy claim or medical encounter for drug administration during relevant pregnancy risk windows. We estimated ratios comparing the prevalence of teratogen exposure per 100 000 pregnancies during versus 90 days before pregnancy to account for background utilization. Ratios below 1 indicate exposure during pregnancy dropped relative to pre-pregnancy use. Results: The two study cohorts shared 9 definite teratogenic medications among the top 10 most frequently involved in prenatal exposure. Pregnancy/pre-pregnancy exposure prevalence ratios were consistently higher in Medicaid when compared to pregnancies covered by private insurance: 1.2 versus 0.7 for sulfamethoxazole/ trimethoprim, 0.7 versus 0.3 for high-dose fluconazole (450mg), topiramate 0.7 versus 0.5, lisinopril 0.3 versus 0.2, valproate 0.7 versus 0.7, carbamazepine 1.0 versus 0.8, phenytoin 1.2 versus 0.8, warfarin 0.7 versus 0.6, and losartan 0.4 versus 0.2. Among potential teratogens, drugs with the most frequent prenatal exposures in both cohorts were low-dose fluconazole 3.3 versus 1.3, gabapentin 1.0 versus 0.7, duloxetine 0.9 versus 0.7, and metoprolol 0.9 versus 0.8. Conclusions: Publicly insured persons have consistently higher risk for prenatal exposure to teratogenic medications when compared to those covered by private insurance, even when accounting for prepregnancy utilization.

However, the readability of imprinted and disseminated PILs was not assessed extensively in Saudi Arabia. Objectives: This study aims to assess the readability of PIL of antihypertensive drugs in both Arabic and English languages. Methods: This study was a descriptive analysis conducted in Saudi Arabia in August 2021. PILs of all oral antihypertensive medications in Saudi Arabia were included in the study. The Arabic and English PILs were extracted from the Saudi Drugs Information System (SDI) and pharmaceutical companies' registration documents. The study used Flesch-Kincaid grade level to assess the readability of English and sentence length to assess the Arabic texts. Descriptive analyzes were used to assess the readability scores and the mean differences. Results: It was found that almost 88% of English PILs were above recommended readability level compared to 79% of Arabic PILs. About 89% of English PILs of generic and 86% of brand-name medications were above the readability cutoff point compared with 83% of Arabic PILs of generic and 68% of brand-name medications. The means of grade level for readability of PILs for the widely used antihypertensive medications including ARBs, BBs, combination antihypertensive medications, and CCBs were higher than the recommended readability level (p < 0.05). The highest mean of grade level for readability among English PILs was for combinations of antihypertensive agents (9.35 ± 1.38) and among Arabic PILs was for ARBs (6.15 ± 1.62). Conclusions: The majority of PILs of antihypertensive medications were above the recommended readability level that can be understood by the majority of the public, especially among generic medications and most widely used antihypertensive medications.

1602,"Background: Hypothyroidism (HT) prevalence in the United States (US) was last estimated at the population level utilizing NHANES III data (1988-1994), some 28 years ago. In this study, using NHANES data from the'09/10 & 11/12 cycles, we demonstrate that the prevalence of HT has grown substantially higher Objectives: Update estimates of HT prevalence in the US by analysis of the most recent available NHANES data with thyroid profile, the'09/10 & 11/12 cycles. Methods: Survey data from the'09/10 & `11/12 NHANES cycles were combined. Patients aged 12 years old were included in the NHANES thyroid profile sub-sample; women who were pregnant were excluded. Disease status was determined from blood samples or evidence of HT treatment. Overt HT was defined as presence of elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH > 4.0 mIU/L) and a subnormal or low level of free thyroxine (FT4 < 0.8 ng/dL); patients with a documented prescription for HT treatment were also categorized with overt HT regardless of lab values. Subclinical HT was defined as elevated TSH (>4.0 mIU/L) and normal FT4 (0.8 ng/dL), without a documented prescription for HT treatment. Disease-free patients had TSH levels of 0.4-4.0 mIU/L and no prescription for HT treatment. Eligible HT therapies were levothyroxine, liothyronine. The results were analyzed by available demographic & comorbidity data. Results: Overall, HT prevalence (overt or subclinical) is estimated to be 9.6%, compared to 4.6% cited from the previous NHANES study. Prevalence among women (12.9%) was twice that of men (6.1%).

1613,"Background: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare, acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by progressive peripheral neuropathy. CIDP is difficult to diagnose and the epidemiology is not well characterized in the literature. Globally, reported incidence ranges from 0.7 to 1.6 cases per 100 000 personyears (py) and prevalence ranges from 4.8 to 8.9 per 100 000 py. Few viable treatments for CIDP have been discovered since the first IVIG therapy was approved by the FDA in 2008. This is an area under research and may have contributed to increased awareness of this disease in the past decade. Objectives: To determine the incidence of CIDP in a US commercially insured population and whether there was an increasing trend of diagnosis over the past 10 years. Methods: Using the Optum Clinformatics US health insurance claims database, a cohort of individuals with and without CIDP were identified between 06/30/2010 and 02/28/2021 based on the following criteria: being continuously enrolled in medical and pharmacy coverage for a 6-month baseline period, not having any ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnosis codes for CIDP (357.81, G61.81), multiple sclerosis (340, G35, respectively) or Guillain-Barré syndrome (357.0, G61.0) during the baseline period, 18 years of age, and those with CIDP were identified as having 2 diagnosis codes for CIDP (357.81, G61.81) that were 30 days apart.

1617,"Background: To date, only three studies have reported on the epidemiology of thyroid storm using population-based databases (Japan, Taiwan, and the United States) and data on its fatality are also limited. Objectives: Given the general lack of descriptive epidemiological studies on thyroid storm, we aimed to estimate the incidence rate and case fatality of thyroid storm in Germany based on a large claims database. Methods: Using the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD) we identified patients with at least one inpatient discharge diagnosis of thyroid storm (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision, German modification; ICD-10-GM E05.5) between 2007 and 2017 and calculated age-standardized and age-specific incidence rates in males and females. We defined deaths occurring within 30 days of the diagnosis as thyroid storm-associated and determined case fatality by sex and age group. Results: Overall, we identified 1690 patients with an incident diagnosis of thyroid storm (72% females). Mean age was 60 years (standard deviation: 18.6 years). The age-standardized incidence rate per 100 000 persons per year was 1.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 1.7) in females and 0.7 (95% CI 0.5 to 0.9) in males. In females 60 and >60 years of age, the incidence rate was 0.9 (males 0.4) and 2.7 (males 1.7), respectively. The case fatality of thyroid storm was 1.0% in males 60 years (females: 1.4%) and 16.7% in males >60 years of age (females: 10.9%). Conclusions: Incidence rates of thyroid storm were markedly higher in females than in males and were three times higher in persons >60 years compared to younger age groups.

1624,"Background: While many ongoing studies are investigating the realworld effect of available COVID-19 vaccines on morbidity and mortality, one aspect of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness that has received less attention is the effect of the vaccines on long haul COVID-19 disease after breakthrough infections. Research into this clinical condition has been hampered, until very recently, by the lack of an ICD-10 code to denote the presence of long haul COVID-19 disease in electronic healthcare databases. In October 2021, a new ICD-10 code (U09.9) was introduced for long haul COVID-19. Objectives: We sought to evaluate the prevalence of the new long haul COVID-19 diagnosis code, and describe characteristics of patients who receive it within a large US healthcare claims database. Methods: Beginning in October 2021, and extending through the most recent data available (December 15, 2021), we identified enrolled patients who had a claim bearing the ICD-10 code U09.9, corresponding to long haul COVID-19. For these patients, we also identified any other diagnosis codes received up to 1 month before and 2.5 months after their initial long haul COVID-19 diagnosis. We then ranked these diagnoses by prevalence among the long haul COVID-19 population. Results: A total of 8223 patients received a long haul COVID-19 diagnosis code during this 2.5 months window. The majority (58%) of these patients were female and the majority (69%) were below 55 years of age. The most common co-occurring diagnoses were other COVID19-related diagnoses, such as personal history of or exposure to coronavirus. Other commonly recorded conditions included essential hypertension (38%), unspecified hyperlipidemia (19%), fatigue (19%), dyspnea (16%), Type II diabetes mellitus (16%), hypoxemia (15%), gastroesophageal reflux (14%), anxiety (14%), and chest pain (13%). Many other diagnoses related to cardiovascular problems, weakness/fatigue, and respiratory issues were also present. Conclusions: This exploratory analysis provides insight into early usage of the code for long haul COVID-19 in a large US claims database. The population explored in this analysis is highly heterogeneous, as it may include patients with recent coronavirus infection as well as patients who were infected early in the pandemic and have had ongoing symptoms. Subsequent analyzes will explore the phenotypic patterns associated with this code, including disease trajectory and seek to elucidate the time course from infection to the long haul designation.",1.0,COVID-19,True

1627,"Background: Intentional self-harm is among the top ten leading causes of death in the United States (US) with poisoning being one of the major methods of suicide. National rates of intentional selfpoisoning have steadily increased from 2000 through 2018 based on data from suicide-related exposure calls to the US Poison Control Centers (PCCs). While clinical outcomes of intentional self-poisoning may range from no effect to death, suicide poisoning mortality remains a public health concern and future research to address this concern will rely on the quality of available mortality data sources. Objectives: To compare suicide poisoning mortality trends in the National Poison Data System (NPDS) to the CDC's nationally representative Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) and Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS) databases. Methods: The NPDS data from cases reported to all 55 PCCs are available in near real-time, covering a wide array of substances and including the reasons for overdoses and subsequent clinical outcomes. We assessed NPDS data (2000 to 2021) on self-poisoning mortality and compared annual number of reported suicide cases to the annual number of deaths in CDC WONDER and WISQARS (1999 to 2019) databases, which provide national mortality data based on death certificates (identifying cause of death, injury intent, injury mechanism and demographic data), and nationally projected fatal and nonfatal injury data from Emergency Department (ED) surveillance data, respectively. We plotted linear graphs for annual number of deaths and tested the linear relationships between the number of deaths in the NPDS and each of the CDC databases using simple linear regression models. Results: The mean annual deaths from self-poisoning during the study period were 702 (SD 142), 4644 (SD 730), and 6119 (SD 626) respectively, in NPDS, WISQARS and WONDER data. The proportion of total self-poisoning deaths nationwide in WONDER constituted by NPDS suicide deaths ranged from 8% (in 2002 and 2003) to 14% (in 2019). The correlation coefficients for the linear relationships between NPDS/WISQARS and NPDS/WONDER deaths, respectively, were 0.18 (p-value < 0.001) and 0.21 (p-value < 0.001). Conclusions: CDC WONDER data, which presents final vital statistics data includes more self-poisoning deaths compared to the WISQARS ED surveillance data. While NPDS data are available more rapidly, the NPDS captures a small (8%-14%) proportion of deaths by self-poisoning compared to CDC WONDER data and the proportion captured may not be consistent enough to accurately predict national trends in self-poisoning deaths from trends in NPDS cases.",1.0,clinical,True

The risk of the first complication is fairly well established for T2D patients while the risk of new CVRD complication for those with one of CVRD comorbidities is not well known. Objectives: To assess CVRD and mortality risks for T2D patients with a single CVRD: MI, stroke, PAD, HF, CKD or cardiorenal disease (CRD ,"" HF + CKD) compared to T2D patients without CVRD comorbidity. Methods: A cohort study of all T2D patients without CVRD (diseasefree) or with a single CVRD at baseline (January 1, 2014) identified and followed-up for 5 years in the French SNDS nationwide claims database. Hazard ratios (HR [IC95%]) adjusted for sex and age were estimated using Fine and Gray competing risk model for clinical outcomes (MI, stroke, PAD, HF, CKD, CRD) and Cox proportional hazards risk model for all-cause mortality. Results: From about 2 million T2D patients without cancer or transplantation at baseline, 76.5% were disease-free, 7.9% with a single CVRD and the others having several CVRD comorbidities history. Compared to the T2D disease-free population, the 5-year highest HR of each CVRD was observed in the corresponding comorbid CVRD population: 11.2 [11.0-11.5] for PAD, 8.8 [8.4- 9.2] for CRD, 7.3 [7.2-7.4] for CKD, 5.0 [4.8-5.1] for HF, 3.3 [3.2-3.4] for stroke and 2.3 [2.1-2.5] for MI, in the PAD, CRD, CKD, HF, stroke and MI populations, respectively. HR were also high for CRD in CKD and HF populations (5.6 [5.5-5.7] and 3.3 [3.3-3.4], respectively), for CKD in CRD and HF populations (9.8 [9.4-10.2], 7.6 [7.3-8.0] and 2.4 [2.32.5], respectively), for HF in CRD and CKD populations (7.6 [7.3-8.0] and 2.3 [2.3-2.4], respectively), for PAD in CRD and CKD populations ([3.7 [3.4-4.1] and 2.9 [2.8-3.0], respectively), while all other HR were also statistically significant but with a point estimate  2.0. The HR of all-cause death was 4.3 [4.2-4.5] for CRD, 2.7 [2.7-2.8] for HF, 2.1 [2.0- 2.1] for CKD, 2.1 [2.0-2.1] for PAD, 1.9 [1.9-1.9] for stroke and 1.4 [1.3-1.4] for MI populations. Conclusions: For T2D patients with a single CVRD complication compared to T2D patients of same age and sex without CVRD comorbidity, the risk of subsequent event is high, especially for PAD, CRD, CKD, HF, and to a lesser extent, stroke and MI populations. It was associated with an increased risk of death of about 4 times higher for CRD patients, about 3 for HF patients and about 2 for CKD, PAD, and stroke patients.""",1.0,disease,True

1637,"Background: Non-ischemic idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is considered a significant contributor to heart failure. However, data supporting the epidemiological burden of this potentially genetic disease in the United States (US) is sparse. This study sought to estimate the period prevalence of DCM and the proportion of idiopathic DCM in the US using a large, diverse population from electronic health records (EHR). Objectives: To estimate the period prevalence and clinical burden of DCM and idiopathic DCM in the United States (US) using a large, diverse population from electronic health records (EHR). Methods: This retrospective, observational study included 56 812 806 de-identified patients in Optum® EHR between 2017 and 2019. Suspected DCM cases were identified using ICD-10 coding. Using deidentified notes and unstructured data, 1000 randomly selected DCM cases underwent manual clinical review and validation to determine those that were DCM and idiopathic DCM. The period prevalence and clinical burden of DCM and idiopathic DCM were estimated. Results: Manual clinical review yielded a positive predictive value (PPV) of DCM of 92.5% and an idiopathic DCM proportion of 46.3%. Using the PPV of DCM, the period prevalence of DCM between 2017 and 2019 was 118.33 per 100 000. Prevalence was increased for adults 65 years of age, males, and African Americans. Extrapolation to the US population led to an overall estimated prevalence of roughly 388 350 patients as of 2019. Applying the proportion of cases with idiopathic DCM to the previous estimates yielded an idiopathic DCM period prevalence estimate of 59.23 per 100 000 with an estimated US clinical burden of roughly 194 385 patients. Evidence of actual genetic testing in this population was scarce, with less than 0.43% of DCM cases reporting genetic testing during the study period. Conclusions: This study establishes a period prevalence estimate for DCM and idiopathic DCM by utilizing a conservative case definition. We also observe very low uptake of molecular genetic testing in DCM clinical care. These findings suggest that the clinical burden of genetic DCM may be underestimated.",1.0,disease,True

1644,"Background: Several new classes of cancer therapies (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and supportive care medications (e.g., certain antiemetics) can delay ventricular repolarization, manifesting as QT interval prolongation on electrocardiogram, which is associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Older adults with cancer are at elevated risk for these adverse outcomes due to the high prevalence of comorbid cardiovascular disease and polypharmacy. Yet, few studies have quantified the incidence of SCD among older adults with cancer. Objectives: We estimated the 6-, 12-, and 24-month incidence of SCD among a cohort of older adults newly diagnosed cancer, overall and by age, sex, and cancer type. Methods: We identified all individuals aged 65 years or older with one of 21 solid tumors diagnosed between 2004 and 2017 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program cancer registries. Using linked Medicare enrollment data, we required all individuals to have continuous enrollment in Medicare Parts A and B (and no managed care enrollment) for up to 24 months following diagnosis (or until death, whatever occurred first). SCD was defined using a modification of the algorithm developed by Chung et al using place of death codes from medical claims and ICD-10 cause of death codes. We used the Aalen-Johansen estimator to calculate the 6-, 12-, and 24-month cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and SCD, overall and by age, sex, and cancer type. In SCD analyzes, death due to a cause other than SCD was treated as a competing event. We used bootstrapping with 200 replicates to estimate 95% confidence intervals. Results: There were 1 702 758 older adults with cancer included in the study population; the median age was 75 years; 49% were female; and the most common cancer types were lung (16.6%), prostate (15.6%), breast (13.6%), and colorectal cancer (10.6%). At 6-, 12-, and 24-months, the cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality was 21.1% (95% CI: 21.1%, 21.2%), 29.1% (95% CI: 29.0%, 29.2%), and 38.0% (95% CI: 37.9%, 38.1%). At the same time points, the cumulative incidence of SCD was 0.05% (95% CI: 0.046%, 0.052%), 0.075% (95% CI: 0.071%, 0.079%), and 0.11% (95% CI: 0.109%, 0.120%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of SCD at 24-months was highest among those aged 85+ years, males, and those diagnosed with colorectal (0.153%) or lung cancer (0.115%). Conclusions: While a rare event among older adults with cancer, SCD occurs more frequently among adults aged 85+, with colorectal or lung cancer, and males. Using large healthcare databases, like SEERMedicare, may allow researchers to evaluate the risk of SCD associated with cancer treatments and supportive care medications.",1.0,disease,True

1648,"Background: Vaginal bleeding (VB) affects up to 30% of recognized pregnancies. The risk of cardiovascular outcomes following childbirth complicated by VB not ending in a miscarriage is not well investigated. Objectives: To examine an association between childbirth affected by VB and subsequent women's risks of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Methods: This was a registry-based cohort study in Denmark. Between 1979 and 2017, among 1 329 331 women we identified 3 085 955 pregnancies. Of these, 69 230 ended in childbirth affected by VB within 20 gestational weeks; 2 180 855 ended in VBunaffected childbirth; 578 355 ended in termination, and 258 430 ended in a miscarriage. The outcomes were diabetes types 1 and 2, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, including myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation or flutter, heart failure, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, coronary artery bypass grafting, and percutaneous coronary intervention. We computed the incidence rates per 10 000 person-years and cumulative incidence of the outcomes at 40 years of follow-up, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals controlled for age, calendar year, comorbidities, and socioeconomics at baseline using Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted conventionally and using inverse probability of treatment weights. Results: At the end of follow-up, among women with VB-affected vs VB-unaffected childbirths, the cumulative risks of the outcomes were 4.5% versus 3.5% for diabetes type 1; 13.8% versus 11.1% for diabetes type 2; 25.1% versus 21.4% for hypertension; 10.6% versus 8.2% for ischemic heart disease, including 2.9% versus 2.6% for myocardial infarction; 5.3% versus 4.4% for atrial fibrillation or flutter; 2.3% versus 2.0% for heart failure; 5.1% versus 4.0% for ischemic stroke; 1.8% versus 1.4% for hemorrhagic stroke; 0.5% versus 0.4% for coronary artery bypass graft; and 2.4% versus 1.9% for percutaneous coronary intervention. Adjusted HRs were 1.2 to 1.3-fold increased for diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation or flutter, heart failure, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke as well as a coronary artery bypass grafting. For comparisons of VB-affected childbirths with terminations, hazards were up to 1.3-fold increased for diabetes and 1.1-fold increased for hypertension, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation or flutter, and hemorrhagic stroke. HRs were unity when we compared having VB-affected childbirth with having a miscarriage. Conclusions: Women's hazards of diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes were increased following childbirths affected by VB when compared with VB-unaffected childbirths or terminations.",1.0,disease,True

1654,"Background: To better understand the impact of type 2 diabetes (T2D), data on reliable trends regarding prevalence are key. In addition, it is also vital to know trends in antidiabetic treatment and riskfactor control among people with T2D. Such recent data from European people with T2D are not published yet. Objectives: To update national trends in the prevalence of T2D in the Netherlands for the period 2004-2020 and to assess trends in treatment and risk-factor control. Methods: The DIAbetes, MANagement and Treatment (DIAMANT) cohort was used to calculate prevalence, treatment and risk-factor control over time (2004-2020). DIAMANT is a large and complete population-based, dynamic, prospective cohort of persons with diabetes, derived from electronic medical records from Dutch general practitioners that have given consent to extract their regular care electronic file in the PHARMO General Practitioner (GP) Database for research purposes. A cross-sectional design was used, which was repeated each year for the duration of the study period. Prevalence was calculated by dividing the total number of people with T2D in the DIAMANT cohort by the total number of residents in PHARMO's GP Database. All antidiabetic prescriptions were converted into treatment episodes of continuous use to determine treatment. For risk-factor control, the last measurement (glycated hemoglobin level [HbA1c], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], systolic [SBP] and diastolic blood pressure [DBP]) in the year prior to the year of interest was used. Descriptive statistics were used for all analyzes. Results: The number of residents in PHARMO's GP Database (e.g., population size) increased from nearly 950 000 in 2004 to >3 200 000 in 2020. The number of people with T2D increased from >21 000 in 2004 to >185 000 in 2020. The prevalence of T2D in the Netherlands increased from 2.3% in 2004 to 5.8% in 2020. The proportion of persons with T2D who used any antidiabetic treatment increased from 21% in 2004 to 58% in 2020. Glycaemic control (HbA1c 53 mmol/mol) increased from 19.9% in 2004 to 53.5% in 2014, after which it decreased to 46.8% in 2020. Lipid control (LDL 2.6 mmol/l) increased from 8.7% in 2004 to 40.7% in 2012, after which the increase leveled off (to 50.0% in 2020). BP control (140/90 mmHg) increased from 11.3% in 2004 to 45.6% in 2012, after which the increase leveled off (to 53.7% in 2020). Conclusions: During 2004-2020, the prevalence of T2D in the Netherlands more than doubled. The proportion of patients using any antidiabetic treatment increased steadily throughout the study period. Diabetes risk-factor control improved from 2004 to the early 2010s but subsequently declined or stagnated.",1.0,,True

1658,"Background: Chronic cough (CC), lasting for 8 weeks or more, can be caused by various respiratory/non-respiratory medical conditions and other factors. Emerging evidence suggests some CC may have a single disease entity with neural dysregulation. Limited evidence is available on patient characteristics among CC patients. Objectives: To examine the trends in cough medication (CM) use and characteristics among CC patients. Methods: We conducted repeated annual cross-sectional analyzes using 2013-2019 statewide electronic health records from the One Florida Clinical Research Consortium database. Among patients without cancer or benign respiratory tumor diagnoses and with 2 medical encounters, we identified CC patients (aged 18 years) defined as having any 3 clinical cough events (i.e., a cough diagnosis, or a prescription of opioid antitussives, benzonatate, or dextromethorphancontaining medications) occurring within 120 days. We required the first and last of the 3 events to be 8 weeks apart and any 2 of the 3 events to be 3 weeks apart. We examined the trends in CM use among CC patients from 2013 to 2019 using multivariable generalized estimating equations and described patient characteristics in 2019. Results: From 2013 to 2019, there were increasing trends in benzonatate use (16.3% to 23.7%) and gabapentinoid use (9.2% to 15.2%) among CC patients, while opioid-containing antitussive use has increased till 2015, and then decreased (11.3% in 2013, 16.3% in 2015, and 12.2% in 2019) (all p < 0.001). Dextromethorphan use remained stable (8.7% to 11.1%; p , 0.13). Of 1966 CC patients in 2019 (aged 65 years ,"" 31.2%, female "","" 68.7%, White "", 63.2% and Hispanic ,"" 12.5%), 92.6% resided in metropolitan counties, 38.4% had 1 hospitalization and 43.3% had 2 emergency department visits. Medicare was the most common primary payer for CC patients (39.9%), followed by Medicaid (33.6%) and commercial insurance (20.6%). The top 3 most frequently diagnosed respiratory comorbidities were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (48.0%), acute upper respiratory tract infections (45.3%), and bronchitis (41.1%); whereas musculoskeletal disorders (71.9%), hypertension (66.5%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (52.4%) as the most frequently diagnosed non-respiratory conditions. The top 3 frequently prescribed concomitant medications were antibiotics for respiratory infections (47.1%), inhaled short-acting beta-agonists (37.9%), and H1 antagonists (30.3%). Conclusions: Among CC patients in Florida, there were increasing trends in benzonatate and gabapentinoid use and a decreasing trend in opioid-containing antitussive use. CC patients had substantial burdens of respiratory/non-respiratory comorbidities and healthcare and concomitant medication use.""",1.0,respiratory,True

1665,"Background: Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. To the best of our knowledge, treatment incidence rates (TIR) and treatment prevalence (TP) of glaucoma and intraocular hypertension (GLC-IOH) have not been previously quantified in a large population sample in the United Kingdom (UK). Objective: To quantify the number of patients with treatment for glaucoma (GLC) and intraocular hypertension (IOH) in the UK. Methods: Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), GOLD, we calculated crude and age-standardized treatment incidence rates (AS_TIR) as well as treatment prevalence for GLC-IOH from 2000 to 2019. We assessed person-time of all patients at risk of treatment for GLC-IOH and the number of incident cases with treatment for GLC-IOH, stratified by age, sex, year of diagnosis, and region. We defined cases with treatment for GLC-IOH as individuals with at least two documented prescriptions of antiglaucoma medication or glaucoma surgery. Results: We identified 107 215 incident cases with treatment for GLCIOH in 79.2 million person-years (py) from 2000 to 2019. The AS-TIR per 100 000 py (95% CI) for GLC-IOH remained fairly stable during this period: 123.66 (120.45-126.88) to 142.11 (138.71-145.51) cases per 100 000 py. The treatment incidence rates sharply increased with increasing age, with highest incidences at 80-89 years (average 606.77 (598.78-614.75) per 100 000 py). We observed a preponderance of female cases starting from the age of 70 years. Treatment incidence rates for GLC-IOH were highest in London, England and Wales and 20 to 30% lower in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Treatment prevalence for GLC-IOH increased by 32.7% from 1.19% (1.12-1.27%) to 1.58% (1.50-1.67%) during the study period. The treatment prevalence was highest in the elderly: 9.4% in those over 80 years, and almost 12% in the age group >90 years had treatment for GLC-IOH. Conclusions: In our large nationwide study of treatment rates for GLC-IOH in the UK, the overall treatment incidence rates for GLCIOH remained fairly stable from the year 2000 to 2019. However, the treatment prevalence increased by one third. Treatment incidence as well as prevalence of were different across regions of the UK.",1.0,Clinical,True

1669,"Background: Few studies have reported the burden of osteoarthritis (OA) in different parts of India. However, no study has reported the detailed estimates of incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) and its trends for OA (and its various sites) across the states of India over a long period of time. Objectives: We aim to describe the state-wise prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for osteoarthritis (OA) in India from 1990 to 2019 according to age and sex. Methods: Data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 were used. The burden of OA -including knee OA, hip OA, hand OA, and other OA- was estimated for India and its states from 1990 to 2019 through a systematic analysis of prevalence, incidence, and YLDs modeled data using the methods reported in the GBD 2019 Study. All estimates are presented as counts and age-standardized rates per 100 000 population, with uncertainty intervals (UIs). Results: Around 23.46 million individuals in India had OA in 1990; this increased to 62.35 million in 2019. The age-standardized prevalence of OA increased from 4895 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 4420- 5447) in 1990 to 5313 (95%UI: 4799-5898) in 2019, per 100 000. OA was the 20th most common cause of YLDs in India in 2019, accounting for 1Á48% (95%UI: 0Á88-2Á78) of all YLDs; increasing from 23rd most common cause in 1990 (1Á25% (95%UI: 0Á74-2Á34)). Knee OA was the most common form of OA, followed by hand OA. The prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for OA and knee OA were consistently higher in females than males. Uttar Pradesh (8.53 million (95% UI: 7.63-9.53), Maharashtra (6.37 million (95%UI: 5.75-7.06), and West Bengal (4.90 million (95%UI: 4.39-5.46) had the three highest levels of OA prevalence. Goa (5689 (95%UI: 5125-6282)), Rajasthan (5667 (95%UI: 5097-6305)), and Kerala (5658 (95%UI: 5107-6263)) had the highest age-standardized prevalence of OA in 2019, per 100 000. Conclusions: The burden and impact of OA in India are substantial and is increasing; however, it varied among states. Females were affected more commonly than males. Knee OA was the most prevalent site. With improvement in life expectancy and population aging, greater increases are expected. Adopting suitable control and preventive community measures to reduce modifiable risk factors (such as obesity, injuries, and occupational stress) are needed now to reduce the current and future burden of OA in India.",1.0,Disease,True

Yet, data on how psychiatric morbidity influences the association between SEP and breast cancer prognosis is scarce. Objectives: To investigate the influence of prior psychiatric medical treatment on the association between SEP and breast cancer recurrence and mortality in a cohort of premenopausal women diagnosed with non-distant metastatic breast cancer in Denmark. Methods: We conducted a nationwide cohort study, and crosslinked data from Danish registries on breast cancer, prescriptions for psychiatric medication, comorbidities, marital status, cohabitation, income, education, and employment. From the Danish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG) registry we assembled a cohort of all premenopausal women diagnosed with non-distant metastatic breast cancer between 2002 and 2011, who were aged <,""54 years. We classified the women as prior users of psychiatric medication if before breast cancer diagnosis they had redeemed two or more prescriptions of psychiatric medication with one of the ATC codes: N05A (antipsychotics), N05B (anxiolytics) and N06A (antidepressants). We followed the women from the date of breast cancer surgery until death, emigration, recurrence, other malignancy, 10 years after diagnosis or 25 September 2017. Using Cox regression, we estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals associating SEP with (1) recurrence (including breast cancer-specific mortality) and (2) all-cause mortality, stratifying models according to prior use of psychiatric medication. Results: The study cohort included 5861 women. Of these, 976 developed recurrence and 857 women died during follow up (median 7 and 9 years of follow up, respectively). Women with low SEP had increased risk of recurrence and all-cause mortality. Among women with low education level, HRs of recurrence and mortality were higher among prior users of psychiatric medication than seen in women with no prior use, indicating potential effect-measure modification. No differences were observed for the remaining SEP exposures. Conclusion: Psychiatric morbidity may partly explain the increased risk of recurrence and all-cause mortality seen in women with low education level. For the remaining SEP exposures, use of psychiatric medication prior to breast cancer diagnosis did not influence the association between SEP and breast cancer prognosis.""",1.0,flu,True

1678,"Background: Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder that affects the skin and is associated with several comorbidities and other allergic conditions. Due to immune dysregulation in patients with AD and subsequent frequent use of immune modulating drugs, the dermatology community remains concerned about the risk of acquiring coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in individuals with AD. Objectives: To report the incidence of COVID-19 among patients with AD by conducting a literature search. Methods: A targeted literature search was conducted in PubMed and Embase through January 2022 for observational studies reporting the incidence of COVID-19 among the AD population of all severities and ages using search terms representative of AD and COVID-19. Case series, case reports, studies focused on COVID-19 incidence with the use of specific systemic drugs, and studies that report prevalence of AD in COVID-19 tested/positive population were excluded. Results: The search yielded a total of 520 articles in both databases, of which six articles reported the incidence of COVID-19 in the AD population. The overall incidence of COVID-19 per 1000 AD patients ranged from 8.7 to 70.3 in registry-based studies while the incidence in population based (Claims/EHR) studies ranged from 41.8-46.3. Additionally, one study reported an increased risk (RR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.12-1.24) of COVID-19 in AD patients compared to patients without AD. Of three studies that examined COVID-19 symptomology, 95.4% to 96.4% of the COVID-19 infected AD patients were either asymptomatic or had mild COVID-19 symptoms, and 3.5% to 4.6% of patients had moderate to severe COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusions: The claims/EHR based studies reported similar estimates of incidence while the registry-based studies reported varying COVID-19 incidence estimates. These differences may be explained by the different countries in which they were conducted, the different study periods, and that one study was conducted in New York City, the epicenter of COVID-19 in the US at the time. The limited evidence available suggest, that the AD population may have a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection, further research is needed to better understand the role of severity, treatment and other factors for the risk of COVID-19 among people with AD.",1.0,community,True

However, a comprehensive analysis to capture major infections among the elderly is very limited. Objectives: This study aimed to estimate age- and gender-specific incidence of infections, including UTI, pneumonia, sepsis, cellulitis and cholecystitis, and to investigate the economic burden of each infection (for both incident and recurrent episodes) among the elderly in Taiwan. Methods: We identified individuals aged 65 years old and older from the National Health Insurance Research Database between 2000 and 2019 in Taiwan. Nine pre-selected infection episodes (UTI, pneumonia, sepsis, cellulitis, cholecystitis, bloodstream infection, endocarditis peritonitis, and meningitis) were identified by any admission with corresponding diagnosis codes (ICD-9 or ICD-10). The incidence rate (per 1000 persons) for each infection were calculated annually within different age and gender groups. For economic burden, direct medical costs and length of stay were estimated for the index event (the first episode within study period of each enrollee) and subsequent events. In addition, time interval between each event were also presented. Results: The incidence of all selected infections was 78.4 and 86.9 (/1000 persons) in females and males during our study period. The incidence of infection in women aged 65-74, 75-84, and 85+ was 45.4, 101.1, and 200.5 (/1000 persons), respectively, while in men was 52.1, 114.0, and 211.9 (/1000 persons). UTI was the most common infection in old women (45.5/1000 persons), while pneumonia was the most prevalent one in old men (48.1/1000 persons). The medical costs of an infection admission in older adults was USD $1474 (mean, Q1-Q3: 7523 298), and 21.32% of them had been admitted in intensive care units. After the index event, 57.6% patients had the subsequent infection episode, with the time from the index event as 337 days (mean, Q1-Q3: 58-1127) and the medical costs increased from USD $1323 (mean, Q1-Q3: 656-3145) in index event to $1450 (mean, Q1-Q3: 738-3296) in subsequent event. Conclusions: Overall, the incidence of infection was higher in old men than women in all age groups, and increased with age. UTI and pneumonia were the two dominant infections in the elderly. Recurrent infections has incurred significant clinical and economic burden. A comprehensive geriatric assessment should consider the impact of infection on clinical outcomes of older adults.",1.0,clinical,True

The association of CIDP with diabetes remains controversial, as both diseases have increased prevalence in older patients, underlying inflammatory pathogenesis, and can present with peripheral neuropathy. Some diabetes patients with diabetic neuropathy can be misdiagnosed with CIDP, but it may be less likely that CIDP patients will have misdiagnosis of incident diabetes. Objectives: To evaluate the incidence of diabetes mellitus among CIDP patients compared to the general population. Methods: Using the Optum Clinformatics US health insurance claims database, a cohort of individuals with and without CIDP were identified between 06/30/2010 and 02/28/2021 based on the following criteria: being continuously enrolled in medical and pharmacy coverage for a 6-month baseline period, not having any ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnosis codes for CIDP (357.81, G61.81), multiple sclerosis (340, G35, respectively) or Guillain-Barré syndrome (357.0, G61.0) during the baseline period, be 18 years of age, and those with CIDP were identified as having at least 2 diagnosis codes for CIDP (357.81, G61.81) that were 30 days apart. The index date for CIDP patients were the date they satisfied the disease definition, a random index date was assigned to general population individuals. We followed all individuals in the cohort until the earliest of death, disenrollment from their insurance plan, or the end of available data (08/31/2021). CIDP patients and general population individuals were matched 1:5 based on age, sex, and index year. Incidence of diabetes in both groups were identified as having at least 2 diagnosis codes for diabetes (250.x, E10.x, E11.x) that were 30 days apart. Results: A total of 2832 CIDP patients were matched to 14160 general population individuals in the database over the study period. The mean age was 65 years (SD 15) and 58% were male. There were 283 cases of diabetes among the CIDP patients and 559 cases among the general population, resulting in incidence rates of 35/1000 person-years (py) and 21/1000 py respectively. The incidence rate ratio was 1.63 (95% confidence interval 1.42, 1.89). Conclusions: There was a significantly higher rate of diabetes among CIDP patients than in the general population.",1.0,disease,True

1723,"Objectives: To evaluate population level mortality trends by CML, ALL, and CLL subtypes to assess how varying levels of targeted treatments penetrations may impact the mortality trends at the population level. Methods: We used data from 13 US SEER cancer registries (1992- 2017) among US adults. We identified cases of CML, ALL, and CLL using histology codes. Incidence rates were calculated after accounting for reporting delays. To calculate mortality rates, cause of death was ascertained from death certificates during 1992-2018. Finally, we present estimates of 5-year relative survival according to subtype and diagnosis year. Results: For CML patients, mortality rates began to decline in 1998 at an average rate of 12% annually. Imatinib was approved by the FDA for treating CML and ALL indications in 2001, leading to a clear benefit on CML patients. CML incidence was stable during 1992-1995, decreased from 1995-2002 at 2.4% annually, and then increased gradually beginning in 2002 at 1.5% per year. Five-year CML survival increased dramatically over time, especially on average of 2.3 percentage points per year from 1996-2011. ALL incidences increased gradually 1992-2017. In contrast, mortality decreased slowly during 1992- 2012 and then no longer was found to be declining during the study period. Five-year survival increased on average 1 percentage point for each subsequent year of diagnosis. CLL incidence fluctuated during 1992- 2017. In contrast, mortality decreased during 1992-2011 and then declined at a faster rate by 3.6% per year starting from 2011. Five-year survival increased steadily during 1992-2016. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates a fluctuation in rates of incidence and survival in all studied leukemia subtypes with a marked and significant reduction in CML mortality in the US general population, which was primarily due to the introduction to the TKIs starting in 2001.

From April 1 to December 11, 2020, we identified as cases all cohort members with an incident ICD-10-CM hospital discharge diagnosis of COVID-19. We randomly selected up to 10 controls per case from the base population, matched on index date and neighborhood (census block or block group). Nursing home cases were matched to controls from the same facility. We defined -1 blocker use as a prescription fill providing 15 days of supply during the 30 days prior to index date. 5- reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) use, an alternative BPH therapy, was the comparator. The outcome of COVID-19 hospitalization had 2 levels: uncomplicated and severe (complicated by intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death.

1741,"reported suspected sepsis from two healthcare facilities in Abuja from October 2020 to May 2021 to assess sepsis case finding, samples request and antimicrobial therapy. Data were descriptively analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine factors associated with blood culture requests. Results: In the online survey, 32% (8/25) of facilities reported performing blood cultures. Only one had access to a clinical microbiologist, and 28% (7/25) and 4% (1/25) used standard bacterial organisms for quality control of media and quality control strains for AST, respectively. At the two facilities where data abstraction was performed, 7.1% (2924/41066) of patients were found to have reported suspected sepsis. Majority of these patients came from the pediatrics department, were outpatients and the median age was two years. Most did not have vital signs or major foci of infection documented. Blood cultures were requested for 2.7% (80/2924) of patients. Inpatients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 7.5, 95% CI: 4.6-12.3) and patients from the urban health care health facility (aOR: 16.9, 95% CI: 8.1- 41.4) were significantly more likely to have a blood culture requested. After consultation, more antibiotics in the Watch category (66.8%, 1628/2436) were prescribed for these patients compared to the Access category antibiotics (33.2%, 808/2436). Conclusions: A significant number of sepsis patients were in the pediatric age group with clinician suspicion used as principal tool for case finding. The use of blood culture for targeted therapy very poor and being an inpatient increased the odds of having a request. The use of Watch versus Access antibiotics increased, rising above the set target (60% for Access antibiotics). It is important to set up diagnostic stewardship programs at these hospital to improve the detection and targeted treatment of sepsis.",1.0,case,True

Objectives: To characterize, compare and contrast sociodemographic, comorbidity, asthma medication, and clinical measurements of asthma patients with and without COVID-19 outcomes of different severity across age groups. Methods: We included asthma patients from the Swedish National Airways Register (SNAR), identified four COVID-19 outcome groups (diagnosis, hospitalization, intensive care, and death) and a general population group among them, and linked to data from several national health registers. The study period was Jan 2020-Feb 2021. Subjects were grouped into adolescents (12-17 years) and adults (age groups 18-39, 40-64 and 65+).

The mean age across the studied age groups gradually increased from milder to worse COVID-19 outcomes and was higher than the population. In all age groups, females were in majority (53-65%), except in adolescents, where males predominated in both the population (53.6%) and COVID-19 diagnosis group (52.3%). Adolescents with asthma and COVID-19 had more allergy and autoimmune disease than their non-COVID-19 peers (73%-80% vs. 72% and 1%-13% vs. 0.8%, respectively). The prevalence of comorbidities in COVID-19 positive adults 40 years was higher than in the corresponding asthma population - especially cardiovascular disease (2970% vs. 15-47%), diabetes (10%-30% vs. 4- 11%) and psychiatric disorders (10%-25% vs. 3-6%) - most notably for COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Elevated use of bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and poor asthma control was more prominent in asthma patients with severe COVID-19 outcomes and older age groups than in the asthma population. Body mass index was particularly elevated in age group 40-64 years with asthma and COVID-19 (29-33Kg/M2), and current smoking especially prevalent (5%-14%) among age group 18-39 years with COVID-19.

Objectives: To investigate the use of metamizol and other NOADs in Switzerland over time, and to characterize users of different NOADs with regard to age and co-medications. Methods: We conducted a retrospective descriptive study using the claims database of the largest Swiss health insurance company (Helsana). We identified all claims (ATC-codes) of metamizol, ibuprofen, diclofenac, and paracetamol in patients aged 18 years or older. We evaluated the number of dispensed defined daily doses (DDD) of each NOAD from 2014 to 2019. To characterize users of different NOADs, we identified the first claim of each NOAD of interest (metamizol, ibuprofen, diclofenac, and paracetamol) per patient in 2019.

1788,"Background: Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is an additive, which is widely used in products such as cosmetics, drugs and foods for its bleaching and opacifying properties. TiO2 as a food additive has recently gained considerable attention because of its hypothesized harmful effects including carcinogenesis, inflammation or metabolic dysregulation. On October 8 2021, the Member States of the European Union approved the European Commission's proposal to ban the use of TiO2 as a food additive from July2022. However, the population might still be exposed to TiO2 through drug consumption. Objectives: We therefore aimed to describe the presence of TiO2 in drugs available on the French market and to estimate the French population exposure to TiO2 through drug consumption. Methods: We used data from the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to identify all pharmaceutical presentations marketed in France. We used the Theriaque® database to retrieve detailed information on these drugs such as their pharmaceutical form, route of administration or presence of TiO2 or other excipients. The ANSM provided us with data on the corresponding amounts of TiO2 present. We also retrieved the annual number of boxes reimbursed by the French national health insurance system for each pharmaceutical presentation. We described the presence of TiO2 in pharmaceutical drugs marketed in France from 2001 to 2020. Results: Preliminary results showed that among the 38 322 pharmaceutical presentations available on the French market from 2001 to 2020, 11 698 (30%) contained TiO2. Among the 22 014 pharmaceutical presentations which have been reimbursed at least once from 2001 to 2020, 9280 (42%) contained TiO2, corresponding to 15 437 075 836 reimbursed drug boxes, versus 25 675 546 647 reimbursed drug boxes",0.0,,False

It is prudent to reduce unnecessary long-term prescribing of PPIs. Objectives: To measure the impact of mailing personalized prescribing portraits and summary evidence letters cautioning against long-term PPI prescribing in primary care. Methods: Family physicians (n ,"" 5348) in the province of British Columbia, Canada, were randomized by postal code into four arms: early Portrait-Letter; delayed Portrait-Letter; early Portrait/delayed Letter, and vice versa. The primary outcome was change in defined daily doses (DDD) of PPI per patient. Secondary outcomes included duration of therapy, dose per day, and incidence of therapy discontinuation and starting. Using linear regression, outcomes in the 3-month delay period were compared with the 3-month window immediately before the first mailing. Results: The intervention and control groups were balanced on physician age, sex, and prescribing volume. The mean baseline prescribing of PPIs was 71.5 defined daily doses (DDD) per patient. The prescribing portraits were associated with a reduction in mean DDD dispensed per patient of À1.07 (95% CI: À2.54 to 0.40). The evidence letters were associated with a reduction in mean DDD dispensed per patient of À0.66 (95% CI: À2.08 to 0.75). The combined impact of the portrait and letter was not additive, with a change in mean DDD of À1.03 (À5.88 to 3.80). The portrait and letter were also each associated with statistically nonsignificant reductions in duration of therapy and dose. There was no evidence of change in therapy discontinuation or new therapy starts. Conclusions: In a randomized trial of PPI personalized prescribing portraits and evidence summary letters, we did not find a behavior change in PPI prescribing in the short term.

1798,"Background: Audit and feedback are core components of quality improvement, but trials have been criticized for being uncoordinated, lacking innovation, and underpowered. To date, in British Columbia (BC), Canada, physician-prescribing portraits have been sent by mail, a costly process that is difficult to repeat efficiently and to evaluate. Objectives: To assess how the stages in operationalizing a secure online portal to provide up to 5000 family physicians (FP) with personalized prescribing portraits, influenced evaluability. Methods: Stage 1: To get data access permission, a security threat and privacy risk assessment was needed of a method to track when FPs accessed their portraits, without revealing their identities, yet allowing linkage to anonymous databases needed for impact evaluation. Stage 2: In developing the portal infrastructure, including website design, server architecture, and data transfer processes, we needed a way to delay access to randomized control groups. Stage 3: Online accessibility added new dimensions to iterative design of portraits via an interdisciplinary team with evidence review usability testing by a select panel of physicians: these processes should be able to continue after publication, with clarifications aided by feedback. Stage 4: A simple authorization process for physician registrants (https:// secure.ti.ubc.ca), creates a yes-no metric of engagement (registration), leading to a quantitative metric - number of webpages accessed. Stage 5: Randomized promotions by email or mail (with each new Portrait) provide opportunities for low-cost trials of testing engagement innovations: for example, 300 FPs were randomized to 3 groups, 2 with 6-month delays in access to their online portraits. Impact on accessing 4 other pre-loaded portraits will be assessed. Nonrandomized impact evaluations will compare FPs who access their Portraits during in-person educational sessions with non-participants. Results: Online portraits created new channels for qualitative evaluation of ongoing feedback from FPs when they access Portraits by themselves or in educational sessions with their peers. Conclusions: Online Portraits pave the way for combining randomized trials with cycles of quality improvement in audit and feedback methods.",1.0,trial,True

1801,"Background: Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (ticagrelor (TIC), prasugrel (PRAS), or clopidogrel (CLOP)) is critical for patients with ACS and PCI to prevent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) through platelet inhibition. Compared with CLOP, the more potent P2Y12 inhibitors, TIC/PRAS, were superior in reducing MACE in clinical trials but have a higher bleeding risk, which is more pronounced as the treatment duration extends. Thus, treatment recommendations consider de-escalation from TIC/PRAS to CLOP to reduce the bleeding risk during the maintenance stage. There are no recent data on the initial choice and switching/de-escalation of P2Y12 inhibitors after PCI in real-world settings. Objectives: To describe the initial choice of P2Y12 inhibitors and switching rate and direction after PCI discharge. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using IBM® MarketScan® Commercial claims data from 2009 to 2018. We included patients 18 years, diagnosed with ACS, discharged after PCI, without prior use of P2Y12 inhibitor in the past 12 months. The first P2Y12 inhibitor prescription had to be filled within 30 days after PCI discharge (index date). Patients were required to have at least 12-month continuous medical and pharmacy enrollment before the index date to assess eligibility criteria. They were followed for 12 months. A switching event was defined as the first-time change of P2Y12 inhibitors from the original choice during the 12 months maintenance period, which included escalation (CLOP -> PRAC/TIC), deescalation (PRAS/TIC ->CLOP), and switch (PRAS -> TIC or vice versa). Patients had to stay on treatment (gaps between two prescriptions <30 days) to be assessed for switching. Results: 42 199 patients initiating P2Y12 inhibitors after PCI discharge were included. Use of CLOP decreased across the study period with a prevalence from 97.5% in 2009 to 32.3% in 2018. The preference for more potent inhibitors increased with prevalence from 2.5% (PRAS 2.5%, TIC 0%) in 2009 to 67.7% (PRAS 10.1%, TIC 57.6%) in 2018. A total of 4245 switching events were identified. The switching rate increased from 1.4% in 2009 to 15.9% in 2018, with stable escalation proportions of 1.3% in 2009 to 1.2% in 2018 among CLOP initiators. The de-escalation proportion for those initiating PRAS/TIC increased from 0.1% in 2009 to 13.0% in 2018. Switches within PRAS/TIC were uncommon with about 1% across 2009 to 2018. Conclusions: More potent P2Y12 inhibitors are increasingly preferred as initial therapy following PCI. Switching increased over the study years, mainly due to de-escalation. Further studies on predictors of switching and real-world outcomes are needed.",1.0,clinical,True

Objectives: To investigate to what extent patients are being treated in accordance with indicators of potentially rational prescribing and the association of this with adequate drug treatment. Methods: The drug treatment of 302 consecutive primary care patients (65-99 years of age, 59% female) was assessed by two general practitioners (GPs), independently and then in consensus, according to 19 Swedish indicators of potentially rational prescribing. The drug treatment was categorized as adequate if no action related to the patient´s medication was suggested by the GPs in consensus, and inadequate if some action was suggested, e.g. to change the drug treatment, order a laboratory test, or schedule an extra appointment. Results: For a total of 223 (74%) patients, 1 indicator of potentially rational prescribing was fulfilled; 524 such instances were found (range: 0-7/patient). The top tree fulfilled indicators were: (i) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, and/or dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, and/or thiazide diuretic in hypertension (169 (83%) out of 203 patients with this diagnosis); (ii) low-dose acetylsalicylic acid or clopidogrel or oral anticoagulant in ischemic heart disease (56 (92%) out of 61 patients); and (iii) statin in ischemic heart disease (43 (70%) out of 61 patients). For 2 (1%), 0 (0%), and 5 (8%) patients, respectively, for whom these indicators were not fulfilled, the GPs suggested to add the drug at issue. Crude logistic regression showed a negative association between having 1 fulfilled indicator of rational prescribing and adequate drug treatment (odds ratio: 0.53 (95% CI: 0.29- 0.95)), but not the adjusted model including age, sex, and the number of drugs: 0.81 (0.42- 1.58). Conclusions: The majority of older primary care patients are treated according to at least one indicator of potentially rational treatment.

Eighty-seven (53%) and 70 (43%) of respondents indicated that they have a standardized national surveillance system for monitoring AMR in humans and animals respectively. Prescribing practices and appropriate antibiotic use in human health are nationally monitored in 56 (34%) countries. Forty-three (26%) and 38 (23%) of respondents offer antimicrobial stewardship training in healthcare and in veterinary settings respectively. Sixty-six (40%) indicated that they have a nationwide AMR awareness campaign targeting stakeholder groups.

We used 2018-2020 data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to estimate the prevalence of disease among recently incarcerated and nonincarcerated populations in the United States. We used IQVIA's National Sales Perspective (NSP) to quantify the distribution of medications to incarcerated and non-incarcerated populations from 2018 to 2020. The NSP provides national dollar and unit sales of prescription medications across multiple distribution channels including prisons and jails (correctional facilities). Results. The US incarcerated population accounted for 0.44% of estimated individuals with Type 2 diabetes in the US, yet only 0.12% of anti-hyperglyemic pharmaceutical volume from 2018-2020, representing a 3.8 fold difference between diabetes burden and medication treatment in correctional facilities. Only 1.8% of diabetes therapies distributed to correctional facilities reflected therapies more recently brought to market, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SLGT-2) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, whereas such treatments accounted for 12.3% of all diabetes therapies used among the non-incarcerated population.

1843,"Background: Long-term, often lifelong care for cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients require consistent usages medication, hence the availability of essential medicines is vital for treatment, survival, and quality of life. However, research on the availability of essential medicines in low- and middle-income countries is scarce. Objectives: Our objective was to assess the availability of essential medicines for CVD (EM-CVD), and to explore facility characteristics associated with availability of those medicines in Bangladesh. Methods: We used publicly available cross-sectional data from two waves of Bangladesh Health Facilities Survey (BHFS) that were conducted in 2014 and 2017. A total of 128 (56 from 2014, and 72 from 2017) facilities were included in the analysis for availability of EM-CVD. The outcome variable `EM-CVD availability' was calculated as a count score of the tracer medicines: (angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (enalapril), thiazide, beta blockers (atenolol), calcium channel blockers (amlodipine/nifedipine), aspirin). Several potential facility characteristics were considered, including managing authority, location, administrative division, external supervision, routine user fee, 24-hour duty schedule of medical specialists, medical officers, nurses, and paramedics, inpatient capability, diagnostic capacity score, and guideline for disease diagnosis and management. Multivariable Poisson regression model was used to identify the health facility characteristics associated with EM-CVD availability. Results: Between 2014 and 2017, there has been an increase in the availability of calcium channel blockers (from 54.7% to 61.9%) and aspirin (from 37.4% to 46.0%), while there has been a decrease in the availability of ACE inhibitors (enalapril) (from 18.8% to 10.7%), thiazide (from 23.5% to 18.2%), beta blockers (from 57.9% to 51.9%). In both surveys, The likelihood of EM-CVD availability was higher (relative risk (RR): 1.88, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.332.65, p-value: <0.01 and 1.97 (1.49 À2.61), p-value: <0.01, respectively) among the",1.0,disease,True

Conclusions: Our findings show that facility management authority (public, private not-for-profit, or private for-profit) and diagnostic capacity are significantly associated to EM-CVD availability. Government officials should consider a variety of policy issues, such as the importance of public facilities and the diagnostic capacity of facilities, in order to increase EM-CVD availability.",0.0,,False

1847,"Background: Most guidelines do not recommend one antipsychotic over the other for the management of schizophrenia, whilst other guidelines recommend starting with an atypical antipsychotic first. There is a lack of recent data assessing the utilization of antipsychotics in Scotland. Objectives: To assess the utilization of antipsychotics in Scottish primary care and evaluate the trends seen. Methods: This repeated cross-sectional study used Scottish Prescription Cost Analysis datasets (covers all prescriptions dispensed in Scottish primary care setting) from 2010-2020. Antipsychotics use was measured using number of items dispensed/1000 inhabitants and number of Defined Daily Doses (DDDs)/1000 inhabitants/day. Results: Both utilization metrics showed an overall increase in total antipsychotics (increased by 26.5%; 1.97 DDDs), an increase in atypicals (increased by 54.8%; 2.84 DDDs) and a decrease in typicals (decreased by 38.6%; 0.87 DDDs). In terms of atypicals, quetiapine had the highest number of items dispensed/1000 inhabitants (increased by 98.4%; 36.4 items), whereas Olanzapine had the highest number of DDD/1000 inhabitants/day (increased by 32.3%; 0.71 DDDs). For typicals, prochlorperazine had the highest number of items dispensed/1000 inhabitants but chlorpromazine had the largest number of DDD/1000 inhabitants/day over the study period and still the number of DDDs decreased by 49.2% (0.31 DDDs) over the 10 years. Conclusions: The utilization of antipsychotics has increased considerably, with atypical antipsychotics markedly taking the lead over typicals. Despite the popularity of certain antipsychotics, particularly atypicals, there is no clear evidence to suggest that one antipsychotic is more efficacious or beneficial than the other, which suggests the most prescribed drugs are prescribed for reasons other than patient/ physician preference and tolerability. This highlights the need for medication reviews to make sure patients are on the most suitable antipsychotic.",0.0,,False

Objectives: To identify groups of patients with similar psychotropic medication patterns and examine the relation between the identified medication groups and subsequent labor market marginalization (LMM) in refugee youths and Swedish-born with CMD (depressive, anxiety, and stress related disorders). Methods: The study used a longitudinal matched cohort from Swedish registers from 2006-- 2014, including data on demography, medications, medical history, and reported LMM of Swedish residents 19-25 years with CMD. Exposure measure was based on psychotropic medication (antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, sedative-hypnotics, mood stabilizers) dispensing collected one year before and after CMD diagnosis. Louvain clustering was applied to identify groups of individuals with similar patterns of dispensed psychotropic medications. Outcome was a composite LMM measure defined as being granted disability pension, longterm sickness absence (>90 days), or >180 days unemployment and it was followed from one year after diagnosis until the end of data linkage, death or emigration.Group membership was used as exposure for the Cox regression (yielding Hazard ratios, HR, and 95% Confidence intervals, CI). Results: Among the 12 472 youths with CMD, 4206 persons (33.7%) had any measure of LMM during a mean follow-up of 4.1 years (SD 2.3 years). Refugees had a lower cumulative dosage in all medications, except antipsychotics, compared to the Swedishborn. Six clusters of patients were identified based on their psychotropic medication use patterns over time. A patient cluster characterized by multiple sustained medications after the peak of the dosages at CMD diagnosis was associated with the highest HRs of the composite LMM (HR (95% CI): 1.84[1.59, 2.11]), whereas the lowest HRs were observed within a cluster with a sharp peak in antidepressants only (1.12[0.90, 1.40]). No differences between refugees and Swedish-born with regard to the association between clusters and LMM occurred. Conclusions: Refugee youths had lower overall psychotropic medication use than their Swedish-born counterparts. Medication use patterns, represented by cluster membership, were differentially associated with LMM similarly for refugees and Swedish-born.",1.0,social,True

1856,"Background: Antibiotic use is an important contributor to the development of antimicrobial resistance. Older adults residing in residential aged care facilities are frail and at high risk for infection, yet little is known about the patterns of antibiotic use among this population. Objectives: To investigate the trends of antibiotic use over time in Australian residential aged care facilities focusing on the antibiotics frequently used for the management of urinary tract infection (UTI). Methods: A cross sectional retrospective analysis of pharmacy medication supply data of residents of aged care facilities in the Illawarra region of Australia between May 2016 and May 2019 was conducted. Antibiotics recommended by the Australian guidelines for treatment or prevention of UTI were included in analysis. The primary outcome consisted of the monthly proportion of residents supplied with an antibiotic. Secondary outcomes were type of antibiotic frequently used and duration of use determined as the number of antibiotic days supplied per 100 resident days for each year. Trends were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: This study included 3459 unique residents that were supplied a total of 7913 antibiotic episodes. Antibiotic use decreased over time with a mean of 17.0% of residents supplied one or more antibiotics of interest per month in May 2016 and 14.8% in May 2019. Among the antibiotics of interest, cefalexin, amoxycillin and amoxycillin with clavulanate were the most frequent antibiotics supplied. The duration of antibiotic use was around 8 days per 100 resident days and remained unchanged over the three-year study period. Conclusions: We found that the supply of antibiotics commonly used for the treatment or prevention of UTI decreased in Australian residential aged care facilities between 2016 and 2019. Antibiotics supplied were generally broad spectrum agents and results of duration of use around the recommended Australian guideline durations. With use of broad-spectrum antibiotics as a known accelerating factor for development of antimicrobial resistance, strategies to optimize antibiotic choice in residential aged care facilities appear needed.",1.0,,True

Methods: Cross-sectional study. 752 consecutive patients with insomnia disorder having sleep maintenance problems were treated in an outpatient Sleep Clinic with low dose amitriptyline (10-20 mg based on self-titration). Treatment was intended to improve sleep maintenance. Before the planned follow-up consultation (around 6 weeks since start treatment) patients completed an online treatment evaluation questionnaire. Treatment (dose, adherence), sleep, fatigue, satisfaction and side effects were assessed by multiple-choice questions with room for free-text elaboration. Results: 53.7% of the patients reported to use amitriptyline up to 10 mg/day, 42.9% used a self-increased dose of mostly 20 mg/day, while 3.5% had discontinued treatment. 73.9 % of the total study population reported improvement of sleep maintenance, 31.3% improved sleep onset, 35.2% improved daytime fatigue, and 45.8% reported to be (very) satisfied with treatment results. 66.1% reported at least one side effect.

Methods: Data on availability and prices of essential medicines for young children (aged 1 month to 5 years) from ten historical World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) datasets were combined into a single database, to increase the volume of data. Two datasets were extracted from this database, both containing 25 composite facilities: dataset 1 (selected at random) and dataset 2 (preference given to medicines that were available). The methodology as proposed was used to run a base case scenario on both datasets. Univariate sensitivity analyzes were performed to test the assumptions related to the NUNT (+/-60%; representing differences in body weights of children within age group) and different scenarios for weighting for DB. An additional sensitivity analysis was run on a continuously smaller basket of medicines to find the minimum number of medicines that should be surveyed to get a stable estimate. Mean facility scores were calculated, which express medicines' accessibility across health facilities. Results: The mean facility score for dataset 1 within the base case scenario was 35.5% (range 8.0-58.8%). Different NUNT scenarios lead to variations in mean scores of +0.1% and À0.2%, or differences of +4.4% and À2.1% at a more conservative NPL of $5.50. Different approaches for weighing for DB induced a variance of 9.0%. For dataset 2, the base case scenario resulted in a score of 76.3% (range 57.2- 90.6%). Variations to the NUNT generated differences of +0.0% and À0.6%. At an NPL of $5.50 the differences were +5.0 and À2.0%. Applying other procedures for DB weighting led to a variance of 11.2%. Less than 5% change in mean facility score was observed for a medicine basket down to 12 medicines. For smaller baskets, scores increased more rapidly with a widening range. Conclusions: We conclude that the proposed methodology provides robust estimates of access to medicines with regard to the NUNT and with baskets of at least 12 medicines. Although small differences were found compared to the base case scenario, we consider a difference of 5% not relevant. Alternative approaches for DB weighting may cause relevant fluctuations, and should be investigated further.",1.0,flu,True

Patients were excluded if had <6-month follow-up or use of DMARD prior to index. Index date was the first DMARD claim, follow up was until end of the study period (31-Dec-2020) or last information available. DMARD starts, duration, discontinuation, and switching were measured and stratified for SUS-exclusive and non-SUS exclusive cohorts. Multivariate logistic and cox regression evaluated determinants of initiating or switching to a new tsDMARD, respectively. Results: We identified 250 251 RA patients with mean age (SD) 58.4 (15.3) years. Majority were female (83%), white (58%), and resided in the Southeastern states (53%). Of those, 62% were SUS-exclusive and 38% non-SUS exclusive. b/tsDMARDs were used by 118 135 (47%) patients; among them, adalimumab was most common (47%, 32%; in 2010, 2020), followed by etanercept (34%, 19%; 2010, 2020), and others. Age (adjusted odds-ratio 1.78 [50+]; 95% CI 1.57-2.01), SUS exclusive (0.53; 0.47-0.59), distance to clinic (0.57 [160+ km]; 0.45- 0.72), and pre-index immunosuppressant csDMARD claims (1.23; 1.08-1.41) were independent predictors of initiating a novel oral tsDMARD (JAK inhibitor). For switching from bDMARD to tsDMARD, associations were similar, except directionality of SUS exclusive (1.10; 1.03-1.18) and distance to clinic (1.18; 1.03-1.35), and number of previous bDMARD (0.15; 0.14-0.16). Conclusions: DATASUS is a valid source for treatment-related analyzes in RA reflecting the public health system in Brazil. Distance to clinic, number of previous bDMARDs, and SUS exclusive were predictive of patients switching to a tsDMARD, which may relate to the convenience of an oral DMARD.

Objectives: To examine temporal trends in acid-suppressants initiation within the first year of life in a large unselected cohort and to detect socio-demographic and medical characterizations associated with treatment initiation. Methods: A retrospective population-based cohort in a large statemandated health fund in Israel, including all members born between 2005-2020. AST initiation was defined as at least one purchase of H2 receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors within the first year of life. The association between AST initiation and socio-demographic and medical characteristics was assessed via multivariable logistic regression including calendar year, birth order, multiple vs. singleton birth, gestational age at birth, infant weight and sex. Results: Among 595 860 children born during the study period, 22 412 (37.6 per 1000) initiated AST. The incidence rate of AST initiation increased by 2.8 fold from 18.2 per 1000 in the year 2005 to 51.0 per 1000 in 2020, while the median age at initiation decreased steadily over time from a median of 3.0 (IQR: 1.6-5.0) to 2.4 (IQR: 1.5-3.8) months. Preterm birth was strongly (p < 0.001) associated with AST usage with OR of 4.23, 3.05 and 1.65 for extreme, early and moderate preterm vs. term birth, respectively.

1882,"Background: Metabolic Syndrome is one of the most prevalent diseases around the world. Since there are various complications related to this disease, it is a real challenge for clinicians to prescribe the most functional series of medications for these patients. In the treatment process of such diseases, multi-drug prescriptions, known as ""Polypharmacy"" are common. Many factors are associated with this issue and it has several untoward consequences and impacts on patients' health and their treatment process. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of poly-pharmacy among the metabolic syndrome patients in Iran at national level between 2015 and 2016, and to assess its correlation with socioeconomic and demographic factors. Then we evaluated the epidemiology of Potentially Inappropriate Medication (PIM) among patients over 60 years with and without poly-pharmacy and assessed its correlation with poly-pharmacy and other socioeconomic and demographic factors Methods: A population based cross sectional study was performed following overlapping data from Iranians Health Insurance Service prescriptions between 2015 and 2016 with patients data from STEPS Iran 2016 study. Epidemiology of poly-pharmacy was evaluated among 2075 metabolic syndrome patients and then, correlation between poly-pharmacy and socioeconomic and demographic factors was assessed using multi-variate regression analysis . Patients 60 years and above with metabolic syndrome were considered as elderly, and then epidemiology of PIM (Potentially Inappropriate Medication) was evaluated through their prescriptions based on American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria 2019 (AGSBC).The correlation of PIM with poly-pharmacy and other socioeconomic and demographic factors was evaluated as well using multi-variate regression analysis. Results: Out of 2075 metabolic syndrome patients between 2015 and 2016, 10.3% (214) had prescriptions with poly-pharmacy. Among socioeconomic and demographic factors, significant correlation of poly-pharmacy with age, area of living and job was observed (P value <0.001). In 2015 and 2016 combined, prevalence of PIM was 6.6% and 46.1% in prescriptions without and with poly-pharmacy respectively. Significant correlation was observed between area of living, poly-pharmacy and PIM (P value <0.001). Conclusions: Poly-pharmacy has a significant relationship with certain sociodemographic factors, therefore preventive measures should be taken to avoid adverse effects of poly-pharmacy among metabolic syndrome patients.",1.0,disease,True

Lasso models predicting 1 prescription and 3 prescriptions showed the C-statistics ranging from 0.641 (maoto) to 0.886 (tokishakuyakusan) and 0.799 (bakumondoto) to 0.930 (kamishoyosan), respectively. The models identified common predictors of different Kampo formulations, such as female sex and previous Kampo use. The models also identified specific characteristics associated with particular Kampo formulations, such as mental and behavioral disorders for kamishoyosan, hochuekkito, and hangekobokuto. The simplified prediction scores were slightly inferior to full models. Conclusions: Lasso regression models showed good performances in predicting various Kampo formulation prescriptions from claims data.

Objectives: To describe the use of cholesterol lowering drugs among treatment naïve patients up to 12 months after being diagnosed with FH, ASCVD, or ASCVD-RE in Denmark. Methods: Nation-wide observational study using the Danish National Health registers between 2015 and 2020. The cohort consisted of treatment naïve patients diagnosed with FH, ASCVD with hypercholesterolemia (HC), or ASCVD-RE with HC who received cholesterol lowering drugs after diagnosis. Treatment naïve patients were defined as patients not receiving any cholesterol lowering drugs before first diagnosis (look-back until 2005).

Objectives: To describe the drug utilization of anxiolytics and sedatives in adults including type of drug, amount, and prescriber's specialty. Methods: A register-based study included new users (age 18- 64 years) of anxiolytics and sedatives in January 2015-December 2019, free of any such prescription 5 years prior to inclusion. The individuals were linked to national register data on dispensed drugs, recorded diagnoses, and level of education. Results: In total, 764 432 new users of anxiolytics and sedatives were identified during the study period, which corresponds to an incidence of 26 per 1000 inhabitants and year.

1910,"Background: Overactive bladder (OAB) is characterized by urinary urgency, frequency and nocturia, with or without incontinence, and significantly reduces quality of life. Anticholinergic medications (oxybutynin, solifenacin, and tolterodine) and a beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist, mirabegron, are the first line pharmacologic agents for the treatment of OAB in England, despite limited effectiveness. However, there are concerns that anticholinergic medications are associated with cognitive decline and incident dementia. Objectives: To describe the utilization of OAB medications in England in adults aged 50 years and older between 2000-2019 by age, sex, and drug. Methods: We estimated the prevalence of prescribed OAB treatment from 75.7 million person-years of registration aged over 50 between 2000-2019 at general practices in England from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum database, stratified by year, age group (50- 59, 6069, 70-79, 80+ years), sex, and drug. Results: Between 2000 and 2019, there was an increase in the number of men prescribed OAB medications from 11 to 24 per 1000 person-years (PY) and in women from 17 to 39 per 1000 PY. Medication use increased linearly with age group. In 2019, of those aged 50-59 years there were 8 men and 23 women per 1000 PY prescribed OAB medications while of those aged 80 years or older, 60 men and 65 women were prescribed OAB medications per 1000 PY. Between 2005 and 2019, prescriptions for solifenacin increased (from 3% of prescribed OAB agents in 2005 to 33% in 2019), whilst declining preference was observed for tolterodine (from 50% to 18% of prescriptions) and oxybutynin (from 37% to 18%). Prescribing of mirabegron has also increased since 2013 (from 1% of OAB prescriptions in 2013 to 20% in 2019). Conclusions: The proportion of patients prescribed overactive bladder agents has more than doubled in England over the past 20 years, with women and older patients receiving more prescriptions. Increased prescribing in older adults raises concerns, due to age-related changes in pharmacodynamics increasing vulnerability to reported side-effects including possible longterm cognitive decline. Although prescribing appears to be switching towards agents with a purported favorable cognitive profile, evidence as to whether mirabegron shares similar associations with cognitive decline as anticholinergics is lacking.",1.0,Clinical,True

The campaign encourages people/carers to take an active role in managing their medicines with 3 steps: (1) Know: your medicines and keep a list (2) Check: that you're using the right medicine the right way and (3) Ask: your health professional if you're unsure. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are encouraged to engage with people about their medicines and the benefits of keeping lists. Objectives: To (1) identify the barriers and facilitators to implementation of the KCA campaign among HCPs, patients and carers and (2) investigate attitudes to patient held medication lists (PHML) Methods: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with HCPs, people taking multiple medicines (5+ medicines concomitantly) and carers of people taking medicines; purposively sampled via social media, patient groups and research collaborators. Interviews were thematically analyzed using the Framework method with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Results: Thirty-nine interviews were conducted with 9 patients, 9 carers and 21 HCPs (6 general practitioners; 2 hospital doctors; 7 community pharmacists; 2 hospital pharmacists and 4 nurses). All groups reported limited knowledge of the campaign as a result of disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. electronic transfer/delivery of prescriptions). However patients, carers and HCPs expressed positive attitudes towards the campaign - seen as empowering for patients, with the potential to improve adherence. Most of the patients used lists and considered them useful in certain situations (e.g. during transitions of care) but concerns about the accuracy of PHML were expressed by all groups. Practical barriers reported across the groups included time pressures for HCPs and difficulties in maintaining medicine lists for patients on multiple medicines, with cognitive impairments or literacy issues. All groups reported the potentially positive influence of appropriate HCPs - such as pharmacists, GPs - in promoting the KCA as well as practical facilitators such as digital/compact lists. Conclusions: The CFIR and TDF identified a number of barriers and facilitators to successful implementation at individual and organizational levels. Encouragement from key HCPs and development of a variety of list formats for patients/carers could significantly increase the impact of the KCA campaign. While attitudes to PHML are generally positive, concerns about the accuracy of lists - held in common by HCPs and patients/carers - need to be addressed.",1.0,social,True

In the years up to 2014, little age differentiation was seen in glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) thresholds at initiation of glucose-and blood pressure-lowering treatment. Objectives: To assess trends in HbA1c and SBP thresholds at initiation of glucose- and blood pressure-lowering medication among patients with type 2 diabetes between 2015 and 2020 and assess the influence of age and sex on these trends. Methods: We used the Groningen Initiative to ANalyze Type 2 diabetes Treatment (GIANTT) primary care database. Patients initiating a first non-insulin glucose-lowering or any blood pressure-lowering medication between 2015 and 2020 with an HbA1c or SBP measurement in the 120 days before initiation were included. We used multilevel regression analyzes adjusted for potential confounders to assess the influence of calendar year, age, or sex and the interaction between calendar year and age or sex on trends in HbA1c and SBP thresholds at initiation of medication. Results: We included 2671 and 2128 patients in the analyzes of HbA1c and SBP thresholds, respectively. The overall mean HbA1c threshold at initiation of glucose-lowering medication significantly increased from 7.4% in 2015 to 8.0% in 2020 (p < 0.001), particularly significant in the younger age groups. Compared to patients aged 80 years, patients aged 60-69 years initiated medication at lower levels mainly in the first years. Patients <60 years and between 70- 79 years initiated medication at similar levels as patients aged 80 years. Females initiated glucose-lowering medication at lower levels than males throughout the study period (p < 0.001). The mean SBP threshold at initiation of blood pressure-lowering medication varied from 145 to 149 mmHg without a clear trend (p , 0.676). There were no significant differences in SBP thresholds between patients of different ages or sex. Conclusions: The rising trend in the HbA1c threshold at initiation of glucose-lowering medication in the lower age groups was unexpected and requires further investigation. Males appear to receive less timely initiation of glucose-lowering medication than females.

Data are needed on the heterogeneity of patients and their antibiotic treatment patterns before and after a positive GIPP result. Objectives: To characterize antibiotic treatment of diarrheal illness before and after a positive GIPP result. Methods: We analyzed electronic health records for patients evaluated for diarrhea in an inpatient, emergency, or outpatient setting in our academic-affiliated health system during 2018 and had a positive GIPP result for 1 pathogen. We excluded patients with HIV, on immunosuppression for transplant, biologics, or steroids. The dichotomous outcome of interest was change in antibiotic therapy after positive GIPP result - initiation, discontinuation, or switch. We constructed one directed acyclic graph for the outcome and covariates (symptoms at presentation, pre-GIPP treatment, GIPP-detected pathogen, age, comorbidity [inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, or cancer], gender, race/ethnicity, age, insurance type, and testing site). To avoid committing the Table 2 fallacy, we enumerated a specific adjustment set to estimate each covariate's association with the outcome. We fit logistic regression models using g-computation to estimate risk differences (RD) for each covariate with bootstrapped 95% CIs. Results: Among 193 included patients, the median age was 31 years (interquartile range, IQR 5-56); 35% were non-white, 45% were female, and 58% were privately insured. The median GIPP turnaround time was 31 h; the most common pathogens detected were norovirus (21%), Salmonella species (21%), and Campylobacter jejuni/coli (18%). 29% of patients received empiric antibiotics before the GIPP result. After a positive GIPP result, 83 (43%) patients experienced a change in antibiotic treatment (primary outcome) - 48% of whom initiated antibiotics, 18% discontinued, and 11% switched. Post-GIPP antibiotic treatment change occurred in 12% of norovirus-positive patients, 53% for Salmonella, and 46% for Campylobacter. In standardized data, antibiotic treatment change was most strongly associated with having one or more comorbidities (RD 29%; 95% CI 2%, 53%), antibiotic use <30 days before GIPP test (RD 20%; 95% CI 0%, 37%), and having public vs private insurance (RD 16%; 95% CI À0%, 32%).

This person-time was used to calculate rates per 100 person-years (PY) of nine commonly used outcomes in pharmacoepidemiology. We also compared rates of new use per 100 PYs for five common drugs and drug classes. Finally, we compared monthly rates to identify when 2020 data differed the most from the other calendar years. Results: The total number of individuals and amount of person-time covered by NC Medicaid from March-September was greatest in 2020 (n , 1 275 189; PY , 698 076) compared to 2018 (n , 1 216 473; PY , 649 667) or 2019 (n , 1 243 958; PY ,"" 661 992), with the larger relative increase in person-years because laws were passed to prevent Medicaid coverage from lapsing during the pandemic. Demographics were similar in each calendar period. Despite this similarity, rates of several outcomes differed substantially in 2020 compared to 2018 and 2019, including higher rates of death (2.35/2.51/2.74 per 100 PY in 2018/2019/2020), lower rates of breast cancer screening in women (3.30/3.27/2.77), and fewer myocardial infarctions (2.11/2.22/1.74), with the largest differences observed in March, April, and May. Other outcomes showed similar trends. While new use of drugs also appeared lower during April (1.99/2.02/1.73 for metformin, 3.45/3.35/3.13 for statins) and May (2.00/1.87/1.66 for metformin, 3.58/3.42/2.92 for statins), a rebound in prescriptions in later months resulted in similar overall rates of new use; this pattern was common to most drugs studied. Conclusions: The pandemic and associated public health measures resulted in substantial changes in the healthcare system that are reflected in the 2020 NC Medicaid data. Establishing how these changes impact outcome misclassification and propensity score estimation will help studies using similar real-world data reach valid conclusions.""",1.0,epidemiology,True

Results: The annual incidence rate of new users of glucose-lowering drugs increased from 2005 (3.9 / 1000 person-years), peaked in 2011 (6.1/1000), and decreased towards 2020 (3.7/1000) to levels comparable to those in 2005. In contrast, the total prevalence of use increased gradually from 2.1% in 2005 to 4.5% of the entire adult population by the end of 2020. By then, metformin comprised 41% of all glucose-lowering drug consumption followed by insulin (20%), glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (13%), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (13%), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (9%). In 2020, 55% of individuals were on monotherapy, 29% used dual therapy while 13% and 2.8% used three and four drug classes, respectively. By 2020, both intensity and diversity of therapies had increased substantially, with 16 different treatment regimens each covering >1% of users, compared to 6 regimens in 2005. In 2020, 89% of all glucose-lowering drugs were prescribed by general practitioners who predominantly prescribed metformin (44% in 2020) followed by insulin (16%) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (12%) while hospital physicians (prescribing 11% of all glucoselowering drugs) most commonly prescribed insulin (41% in 2020), glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (19%) and metformin (17%). Conclusions: While the rate of new users is declining, the total prevalence of use for glucose-lowering drugs continues to increase. The vast majority of glucose-lowering drugs are prescribed by general practitioners and both the intensity and in particular diversity of glucose-lowering treatment is increasing, likely reflecting changing guidelines and increasingly individualized therapy.",0.0,,False

Immediately, international regulatory agencies began systematic withdrawals of affected ARB products as the nitrosamine contamination in each product was confirmed. Objectives: To examine the trends of ARB utilization and switching patterns in the US, Canada, and Denmark, before and after July 2018, when the first ARB (valsartan) was recalled. Methods: As part of FDA's international collaboration efforts, healthcare data from four Canadian provinces and Denmark were converted to Sentinel's standardized common data model. We conducted a retrospective study between 2014 and 2020 to determine the monthly proportion of utilization of each ARB relative to all ARB use, and the quarterly proportions of ARB users who switched to other ARBs or antihypertensives before and after the recall notices. Results: We identified 10 590 009, 790 356 and 492 229 ARB users in the US, Canada, and Denmark, respectively. Losartan had the largest market share in the US and Denmark (60%), while candesartan and valsartan dominated the ARB market equally in Canada. In July 2018, we observed an immediate steep decline in the proportion of valsartan use in the US and Canada that did not return to the prerecall levels. In Denmark, where valsartan contributed only 1% to the ARB market, valsartan trend changes were negligible. With the decline in valsartan use from July 2018, we observed significant increase in switching from valsartan to other ARBs in the third quarter, 2018 (Q3-2018) in the US and Canada. Increased switching was not sustained after Q4-2018. There was a small increase in switching to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors relative to the valsartan-toother-ARBs switch. We also observed increased switching from olmesartan, irbesartan, and losartan to other ARBs in Q1-2019, in US and Canada. In the US, more valsartan users switched to losartan than to other ARB. Losartan users switched more to olmesartan, irbesartan to losartan and olmesartan to losartan. In Canada, more valsartan, losartan, irbesartan and olmesartan users switched to candesartan than to other ARB. Conclusions: Changes in ARB utilization matched the timing of ARB recalls. A rapid decline in valsartan use occurred immediately after the July 2018 recalls. Losartan, olmesartan and irbesartan switching to other ARBs occurred in the first quarter of 2019 matching the recall period for these ARBs.",0.0,,False

1958,"Background: The European Medicines Agency's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee concluded in 2017 that hypotonic intravenous (IV) fluids are associated with an increased risk of hospital-acquired hyponatraemia (HAH) eventually leading to brain injury and death. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment guide implemented in Denmark as part of risk minimization measures to reduce the risk of hospital-acquired hyponatraemia. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey, including a premeasurement (spring 2019) preceding the distribution of the treatment guide (June 2020) and a post-measurement (June 2021). Prescribing practices of IV fluids were assessed by means of four clinical scenarios commonly encountered in the emergency department. Eight multiple-choice questions were used to measure knowledge about IV fluids and hyponatraemia. A priori we defined an absolute success criterion as a risk of being treated incorrectly with hypotonic fluids by no more than 10% of prescribers in each scenario. For the knowledge measure we used a pre-defined threshold of success of 80% correct answers. Chi square test was used to compare prescribing practice before and after the implementation of the treatment guide. Results: After the intervention, about a third (30.5%) reported that they would use hypotonic fluids in patients with increased intracranial pressure, and a quarter (25.3%) would use hypotonic maintenance fluids in children, both of which are against guideline recommendations. About 6% reported to use hypotonic fluids in patients with hypovolaemia without severe symptoms of hyponatraemia and 7.1% would use hypotonic fluids in patients with severe symptoms of hyponatraemia. Significant improvement was only seen for use of hypotonic fluids in patients with severe symptoms of hyponatraemia, which decreased from 16.5 to 7.1% (p < 0.05). For all scenarios together, 20.3% and 17.2% incorrectly selected a hypotonic fluid pre-and post-intervention, respectively. None of the knowledge questions met the predefined criteria of success at 80% correct answers (range 10.8% - 77.6). 21.5% of respondents received the treatment guide and 16.9% read it. Conclusions: Use of hypotonic fluids against guideline recommendations is widespread and calls for further interventions to reduce the risk of hospital-acquired hyponatraemia.

The 2-year persistence was 58.7% (58.5-59.1) in alendronate users; 28.0% (24.5-31.8) in risedronate users; 42.9% (41.3-44.4) in ibandronate users; and 71.9% (71.0- 72.7) in denosumab users. The 4-year persistence was 46.5%, 16.1%, 29.5%, and 56.9%, respectively.

Older age and region of residence were predictors of persistence for all medications. Being female was a predictor of persistence for all medications expect ibandronate. Dementia was a predictor of higher persistence for alendronate but not denosumab; the opposite was observed for prior OTx. Comorbidities such as COPD, chronic renal impairment and diabetes were predictors of lower persistence for alendronate, but not denosumab. Use of anxiolytics, sedatives and opioids were predictors of lower, whereas use of statins and antipsychotics were predictors of higher persistence of both alendronate and denosumab Conclusions: Persistence with initial treatment was highest after 1 year, decreasing afterwards. Persistence was highest for denosumab followed by alendronate.

To determine characteristics of patients who are prescribed low-dose rivaroxaban for the management of ASCVD. Methods: In patients with a prior ASCVD diagnosis, utilization of lowdose rivaroxaban (2.5mg, twice daily) was measured in CPRD Aurum (UK) and the PHARMO database network (Netherlands, NL), from 2015 to 2020. Monthly cross-sections were taken to calculate prevalence and incident prescribing (CPRD Aurum) and dispensing (PHARMO) of low-dose rivaroxaban. Incidence rates (IRs), incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. IRRs compared utilization in the years 2019 and 2020 to reference period 2015-2018, prior to the guideline changes. Comparisons between users or non-users were made using mean differences (MD) in demographic covariates and using chi-squared tests. Results: We included 708 390 ASCVD patients from the UK and 415 380 from the Netherlands, with a median follow-up time of 1043 and 1856 days respectively. In the UK, the IR of new use of low-dose rivaroxaban in the period 2015-2018 was 13.24 per 100 000 person-years, in 2019 the IR was 41.89 (IRR 3.16, 95% CI [2.55;3.91]) and in 2020, 117.16 (IRR 8.85, 95% CI [7.46;10.50]). While in the Netherlands, the IR in 2015-2018 was 2.04 per 100 000 person-years, in 2019 the IR was 37.30 (IRR 18.26, 95% CI [12.10;27.55]) and in 2020, 20.91 (IRR 10.24, 95% CI [6.41;16.36]).

Objectives: To determine prevalence of antidepressant use in women aged 45 to 75 years over time. Methods: Using the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD, ~20% of the German population), we conducted cross-sectional analyzes for each year between 2010 and 2018. We determined the number of women aged 45-75 with at least one dispensation of an antidepressant in the respective year. This number was divided by the number of person years accrued by all women aged 45-75 in the respective year. Similarly, we determined agespecific prevalences of antidepressant use for selected ages (45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75). Results: The overall prevalence of antidepressant use in women aged 45-75 was 153 per 1000 women years in 2010 and slightly increased to 159 per 1000 in 2018. In women aged 50 and 60, respectively, the prevalence increased from 129 per 1000 in 2010 to 133 per 1000 in 2018 (relative increase: 3%) and from 163 per 1000 in 2010 to 169 per 1000 in 2018 (relative increase: 3%), respectively. In women aged 45, 55 and 75 the prevalence of antidepressant use in 2010 was 139 per 1000, 152 per 1000 and 183 per 1000, respectively, and declined to 116 per 1000 (relative decrease: 17%), 151 per 1000 (relative decrease: 1%) and 177 per 1000 (relative decrease: 4%) in 2018. Conclusions: The prevalence of antidepressant use in Germany between 2010 and 2018 showed an increase in women aged 50 and 60 while it decreased in the younger and older women.

Data were collected within SCIFIPEARL, a study including linked data on COVID-tests, hospital diagnoses, dispensed prescription drugs and socioeconomic data from Swedish national registers. Initiations of different antihypertensive drug classes were studied from March 2020 until October 2020. Incidence rates were expressed per 1000 person-year (P-Y) for the exposed and unexposed group. Associations between initiation of antihypertensive medicine and risk of COVID-19 were assessed by a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Results: A total of 224 582 patients (exposed and unexposed) were included.

We observed an increasing trend in the new-generation ASMs polytherapy in both provinces throughout the study period (1998- 2019). The combination of first-first generation ASMs dropped from 97.7% to 44.2% in MB and 90.3 to 17.6%, in SK. Combination of the first-second generation increased from 0 to 10% in MB and 0 to 9.2% in SK, while combinations of second-second generation increased from 0 to 45.8 % in MB and 9.7 to 73.2 % in SK. Conclusions: First-generation ASMs use during pregnancy seems to show a decreasing trend in Canadian populations, as opposed to newgeneration ASMs which are on the rise. It is essential to evaluate the neonatal safety profile of new-generation ASMs, especially those with scarce safety evidence. Future studies on ASMs utilization during pregnancy in other populations are warranted.",0.0,,False

1990,"Objectives: To support further activities in promoting the rational use of opioids, we aimed to describe changes in prescribers' responsibility for opioid initiation and maintenance in Denmark. Methods: We identified a random 20% sample of all Danes alive at any point between 2000 and 2020 and used the Danish National Prescription Registry to identify all prescriptions of opioids filled. We then described the distribution of prescribers responsible for opioid initiation and maintenance. The prescribers were divided into general practitioners, hospital prescribers, and other prescribers. Results: Overall, general practitioners were responsible for most opioid initiation (75% during 2000-2020) and in particular opioid maintenance treatment (92%). However, while hospital prescribers initiated 20% of opioid treatments during 2001-2012, this increased to 36% in 2020. Similarly, hospital prescriber's share of maintenance treatment increased from 5.9% during 2000-2012 to 12% in 2020. This change was particularly pronounced for morphine initiation (49% hospital prescribers in 2020 up from 38% during 2000-2010) and oxycodone initiation (77% up from 41%). Regarding choice of opioids, codeine use dropped markedly, particularly among hospital prescribers. Tramadol was consistently the most common first choice opioid in general practice (32% in 2020), whereas its use among hospital prescribers decreased (from 54% during 2000-2015 to 21% in 2020). Conversely, the proportion of treatment initiation by hospital prescribers comprised of morphine and oxycodone increased to 36% and 40% in 2020, respectively. Conclusions: General practitioners prescribe most opioids in Denmark, however, hospital prescribers are increasingly responsible for opioid prescribing, in particular initiation of morphine and oxycodone.

Objectives: We aimed to identify longitudinal patterns of individual predicted overdose risks after opioid prescriptions were initiated in a state Medicaid program. Methods: We developed a retrospective cohort of Pennsylvania Medicaid beneficiaries aged 18 to 64 years who initiated opioid prescriptions between July 2017 and September 2018. We first applied a previously developed and validated machine-learning algorithm to obtain risk scores for opioid overdose emergency department or hospital visits in 3-month intervals for each beneficiary who initiated opioid therapy, until disenrollment from Medicaid, death, or the end of observation (December 2018). We performed group-based trajectory modeling to identify trajectories of these predicted overdose risk scores change over time. Results: Among 318 585 eligible beneficiaries (mean age ,"" 39 ± 12, female "","" 66%, White "", 62% and Black ,"" 25%), 0.61% had 1 occurrences of opioid overdose in a median follow-up of 15 months.

And we analyzed gender, types of HSP, medication patterns, medical expenditure in the two groups by classifying them into adults (20 years) and children (<20) by 2 test with a significance level of p < 0.05. Results: The male to female ratio in the adult group was 2.1 (68.0% vs. 32.0%), but in the child group, it was 4.2 (80.8% vs. 19.2%) (p<0.01). The proportion of enrolling in the Medical Aid program in the child group (10.8%) was 2.2 times higher than the adult group (5.0%) (p<0.01). The annual average number of outpatient visits for ADHD treatments was no statistical significance in the two groups. MPH was the most frequently prescribed medication (adults: 84.5%, children: 87.6%) in both groups, followed by ATX and CLO. OROSMPH was prescribed the most in both groups, but the proportion of OROS-MPH use in adults (61.5%) was higher than children (45.9%). The proportion of prescribing MPH combination (2+) was higher in children (22.0%) than in adults (16.5%). The average annual medical expenditure for outpatient visits and admissions was $429-$465 and $3283-$5685 with the differences in the two groups were not statistically significant. Conclusions: We identified differences in ADHD treatment in gender ratio, types of HSP, medication patterns between adults and children.

In addition, the quarterly proportion of ARB users that switched to an alternative ARB or an ACE inhibitor was determined, based on longitudinal follow-up of ARB users that had at least one year observability at the time of the first ARB prescription and 2 ARB prescriptions. Changes were assessed by reviewing graphical outputs visually. Results: A total of 5.74 million ARB prescriptions were identified in 552 512 patients during the study period (329 472 patients were followed up for switches). Valsartan and candesartan were the most commonly prescribed ARBs. After July 2018 a significant decline in the monthly proportion of valsartan prescriptions was observed, reaching its lowest level in June 2019. The proportion for valsartan out of all ARB prescriptions decreased from 35.2% in June 2018 to 17.8% in June 2019 (19.3% at end of study). The decrease for valsartan was matched by a corresponding increase for candesartan, from 39.5% in June 2018 to 56.9% in June 2019 (58.0% at end of study). Smaller changes were observed for other ARBs. In line with the decreased monthly proportion for valsartan, increased switching was observed in valsartan users, mainly to use of candesartan, between the third quarter (Q3) 2018 and Q3 2019. There was also evidence of increased switching from irbesartan between Q4 2019 and Q1 2020, 6-12 months after the last batch recall, but no evidence of increased switching from losartan. There was no evidence of increased switching from ARBs to ACE inhibitors. Conclusions: Batch recalls for valsartan resulted in an immediate decline in use of valsartan and switching mainly to candesartan in Germany.

The cumulative incidence was calculated per 100 000 patients by dividing the number of new Esmya users by the number of patients from the study population in the corresponding quarters. Since the release of the different interventions were close, an intervention period that covered the timing in which the corresponding RMMs under study were disseminated was considered. Therefore all interventions were assessed in a single stage. Results: Regulatory actions taken were associated with an immediate and significant falling level of DID and incidence. The DID was 70% less than expected 12 months after the interventions. This value was 59% for the incidence. Despite the immediate high decrease of Esmya use after the intervention, a change in the slope was not observed and the use started rising again in the last segment of the study period from 1.0 DID and 0.4 new users per 100 000 patients in the third quarter 2018, to 7.0 DID and 5.0 new users per 100 000 patients in the last quarter 2019. Conclusions: The RMMs had an immediate strong impact on Esmya use. Nevertheless, the downward trend in the long-term might have been affected by the lack of comparable effective drugs.

Methods: Using claims data from 15% random samples of national Medicare beneficiaries and the entire Florida Medicare beneficiaries, we identified individuals who had type 2 diabetes and initiated SGLT2 inhibitors or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4 inhibitors, as the active control) between 1/1/2017 and 12/31/2018. Cohort entry was the day of the first filled prescription of any SGLT2 inhibitors or DPP4 inhibitors, defined as no use of either in the prior year.

There is lack of research on if racial disparities exist in RA patients with COVID-19 in US. Objectives: To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of RA patients with COVID-19 and estimate the risk of COVID-19 outcomes across race groups Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using US Optum COVID-19 electronic health record data (01/2007-06/2021). Adult RA patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis ( 1 diagnosis code or positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test) and 183 days of database enrollment and treated with immunomodulatory therapies prior to the diagnosis date were stratified into 4 racial groups: White, African American (AA), Asian, and Others/Unknown. Baseline (BL) demographics (age, sex, region, insurance) and clinical characteristics were evaluated. Logistic regression was used to estimate the risk of 11 COVID-19 outcomes within 30 days of the diagnosis, adjusting for demographics and demographics plus BL clinical covariates. Results: A total of 4476 COVID-19 patients with RA, comprising of 15% AA, 72% White, 2% Asian, and 10% Other/Unknown patients, were identified during 2020-06/2021. Compared with White patients, AAs were younger (59 vs. 62 years), more likely female (86 vs. 76 %), enrolled in Medicaid (14.5 vs. 6.5%), with more BL comorbidities/medications (e.g. hypertension: 61 vs. 46%; diabetes: 29 vs. 19%; CKD/Dialysis: 20 vs. 16%; lung disease 28 vs. 25%; corticosteroid: 36 vs. 34%). The adjusted ORs for the comparison were: Hospitalization 1.56 [95% CI 1.28, 1.91]; ICU admission 1.58 [1.11, 2.45]); Pneumonia 1.41 [1.14, 1.74]; Kidney failure 2.36 [1.81, 3.09]; Heart failure 1.55 [1.15, 2.09]; ARDS 1.26 [1.00, 1.59]; Thrombotic events 1.45 [1.03, 2.06]; Sepsis 1.49 [1.08, 2.05]; Mechanical ventilation/ECMO 1.52 [0.99, 2.35]; in hospital death 1.27 [0.86, 1.89]; and all-cause mortality 1.03 [0.72, 1.48]. Asian and Other/Unknown patients had similar demographic profile as AAs though BL clinical characteristics were similar to White patients. Compared with White patients, Asian patients had similar risk for all 11 outcomes while the risk was elevated for hospitalization, ICU admission, Pneumonia, ARDS, and Sepsis in the Other/Unknown group. Conclusions: AA COVID-19 patients with RA had more baseline comorbidities and increased risk of COVID-19 outcomes than White patients.

Additionally, compared to men, women may have a lower likelihood of achieving clinical response, but data related to this topic are controversial. Objectives: We aimed to compare the likelihood of achieving remission across men and women with RA, who started their first biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (b/tsDMARD). Methods: This observational cohort study in the Swiss Clinical Quality Management in Rheumatic Diseases (SCQM) registry included adult RA patients who started their first b/tsDMARD (from 1997 to 31/April/2018). Patient characteristics at start of the b/tsDMARD were compared between men and women. Logistic regression was used to assess the likelihood of achieving remission during the first year after b/tsDMARD start, defined by disease activity score 28 (DAS28) <2.6, in men compared to women (reference group). Secondary analyzes were adjusted for age and seropositivity as prognostic factors. Subsequently, we conducted mediation analyzes to investigate the role of potential mediators or factors that could explain the findings from the main analysis. Results: The study included 3722 RA patients, of which 2839 (76.3%) were women and 883 (23.7%) were men. Compared to women, men were older at diagnosis and start of b/tsDMARDs, and had shorter time from diagnosis to their first b/tsDMARD (3.4 vs 5.0 years, p < 0.001). At baseline (b/tsDMARD initiation), women had significantly higher disease activity (DAS28) and worse patientreported outcomes (Health Assessment Questionnaire, tender joints). Concomitant osteoporosis and depression/anxiety were more frequent among women, while men had more frequent diabetes and prior or current smoking record. Physician's global disease assessment and swollen joints were similar across groups. Compared to women, men had 21% increased odds of achieving DAS28-remission, with an odds ratio (OR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.42. Secondary analyzes adjusting by for age and seropositivity did not change the findings (adjusted OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.46). Our analyzes of potential mediators suggested that the observed effect may be explained by the shorter disease duration and lower DAS28 at treatment initiation in men vs women. Conclusions: Men started b/tsDMARD earlier than women, particularly regarding disease duration and disease activity (DAS28) at b/tsDMARD initiation, and they presented higher odds of remission. This highlights the importance of an earlier treatment, and it suggests to target an earlier stage of disease in women to match the benefits observed in men.",1.0,clinical,True

Repurposing drugs offers a route to therapeutic development that is shorter, inexpensive, and more likely to succeed. The literature documents that metformin may decrease the risk of ADRD although results are controversial. Objectives: To assess the effects of metformin on the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and to determine if there are health disparities in the association. Methods: We used the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, 2015- 2017. Metformin was identified based on the generic name of metformin and the glucophage, glucophage XR, fortamet, glumetza, and riomet. Patients with ADRD were identified based on ICD-10 codes. Confounding factors included were year, age, gender, race, marital status, education attainment, rural-urban residence, census regions, household income, Charlson comorbidities index (CCI), body mass index (BMI), and health status. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify the impact of metformin on the risk of ADRD. All analyzes were conducted using SAS 9.4. Results: 33 590 individuals were included in this study. Overall, metformin is associated with a significant reduction of ADRD risks, and we found significant disparities in the association.

Two types of colorectal cancer screening, including fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, were measured. The colorectal cancer screening knowledge was evaluated by asking if the participants have heard of two screening methods and whether they knew Medicare pays for colorectal cancer screenings. Logistic regression models were used to examine the impact of ADRD diagnosis on the utilization and knowledge of colorectal cancer screening. Subgroup analyzes were also conducted for racial/ethnic, gender, and geographic disparities. Results: The overall colorectal cancer screening rate in older adults was increased from 86.4% to 88.96% from 2015 to 2018. Patients with AD were 39% (OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.50-0.76) less likely and those with RD were 25% (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.62-0.91) less likely to use any colorectal cancer screening when compared to older adults without ADRD. The rate of knowledge of colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy remained high between 84.23% and 84.57% while the knowledge of FOBT increased from 64.32% to 78.69% during the study period. Compared to older adults without ADRD, those with AD were 77% (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.12-2.81) more likely to hear of colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy. The rate of knowledge of Medicare pays for colorectal cancer screening increased from 42.19% to 45.27% during the study period. Compared to older adults without ADRD, those with AD were 19% (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.700.94) less likely to know that Medicare",1.0,clinical,True

2140,"Background: Social determinants of health (SDOH) data are becoming increasingly important in studies using real-world data (RWD). However, it is unclear how disparities variables are operationalized and/or how these data are generated in insurance claims data. Objectives: The aim of this study was to characterize the types of SDOH variables available in RWD, how these variables are generated, and whether the authors disclosed the data generation methods. Methods: A structured search of published literature indexed in Google Scholar and PubMed was conducted. The specific search terms used were ""disparities"", ""United States"", ""claims"", and ""retrospective"". The literature search was restricted to articles that used real-world data sources in the United States, examined at least one SDOH variable, and were published between 2019 and 2021. Quality-control assessments verified summary data against the original articles to ensure accurate data extraction. Results: We identified 35 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Race and ethnicity were the most frequent SDOH variables examined (n ,"" 32), followed by socioeconomic status (n "", 27) and urban/rural residence (n ,"" 14). Among studies reporting race and ethnicity, 59% used a self-reported measure, 31% used an algorithm-derived measure, and 13% had an unknown method. Among studies examining urban/rural residence, only 1 study used self-reported data and 93% used an algorithm-derived measure most commonly based on location. Among studies with at least one socioeconomic status variable, use of proxy variables was the most common method (57%), followed by algorithm-derived measures (14%). Household income was the most common proxy for SES (43%), followed by Medicaid eligibility status (31%), education level (26%), and poverty level (17%). Discussion of data generation methods occurred least often for race and ethnicity, with only 34% disclosing how the variable's data was generated, compared to 71% of papers with an urban/rural residence variable and 78% of papers with a socioeconomic variable. Conclusions: There was significant heterogeneity in how data is generated for SDOH variables and inconsistent disclosure of data generation methods in the real-world data studies. While race and ethnicity were the most common social determinants examined, they had the least disclosure regarding how data is generated for the variable. Further discussion of data generation methods for SDOH variables in real-world databases is warranted.""",1.0,Social,True

However, patients' interest in oral health during cancer treatment tends to decrease. Objectives: To evaluate the incidence of major dental treatment event over time after cancer diagnosis in cancer patients compared to a matched sample of the general population Methods: Time-dependent hazard ratio (HR) and associated 95% confidence interval (CI) of each considered treatment event, stomatitis, tooth loss, dental caries/pulp diseases and gingivitis/periodontal disease, was calculated by applying a subdistribution hazard model with time-varying covariates using the Korean national claims database collected from 2002 to 2015 and mortality treated as a competing event. Subgroup analyzes were conducted by type of cancer. Results: 39 625 cancer patients and a matched control group were selected. The risk of stomatitis treatment was higher in cancer patients than in the control group in all time intervals, with the HR was 2.04 (95% CI , 1.60-2.58) within 30 days after cancer diagnosis and gradually decreased to 1.15 (95% CI ,"" 1.04-1.28) after 5 years.

2157,"Background: Pseudo-randomization techniques such as propensity score matching are commonly used for confounding control in comparative pharmacoepidemiology research. Applications of these methods tend to assume initial treatment compliance, which may be problematic in real world data especially when treatment guidelines are evolving. Intention-to-treat (ITT) effect estimates are popular, because, under the assumption of confounding control at baseline, bias due to treatment switching is commonly thought to be conservative (i.e., toward the null). Objectives: Using a potential outcomes framework for disease causality, simulate the direction and magnitude of bias in the ITT hazard ratio (HR) in the presence of unidirectional treatment switching when baseline confounding control is achieved. Methods: We simulated a cohort study with 1000 pairs of exposed and unexposed patients and their potential outcomes: 1) doomed experience the outcome regardless of exposure; 2) harmed experience the outcome if exposed; 3) protected do not experience the outcome if exposed; 4) immune are not at risk of the outcome. To simulate confounding control at baseline, the sampling distribution of potential outcomes was equivalent among the exposed and unexposed. To simulate a monotonic treatment effect, the proportions of doomed, harmed, protected, and immune patients were set to 0.27, 0, 0.06, and 0.67, respectively. For a non-monotonic effect, harmed patients were included in the population, and the proportions of potential outcomes were 0.18, 0.14, 0.21, and 0.46. In both scenarios, only unexposed patients were at risk of treatment switching. Doomed and protected types had a 0, 50, 70, and 95% chance of treatment switching. Immune and harmed types did not switch. Distributions of ITT HRs were obtained over 1000 repetitions. Results: When the effect was monotonic, the mean [standard deviation (SD)] ITT HR was 0.81 [0.07] when crossover did not occur and converged on the null (HR ,"" 1) as the rate of crossover increased to 95% (mean [SD] 0.89 [0.08], 0.94 [0.08], 0.99 [0.08]). When the effect was non-monotonic, the ITT HR under treatment switching was directionally different (mean [SD] 1.12 [0.09], 1.32 [0.12], 1.69 [0.15]) from the compliance HR (mean [SD] 0.82 [0.06]). Conclusions: Even when patients' potential outcomes are balanced at baseline, the ITT HR in the presence of treatment switching may be directionally different from the compliance ITT HR when the effect is non-monotonic and the mechanism that drives crossover is related to the outcome. This may be the case when clinical practice is evolving and new treatments are given to the patients that are most likely to benefit.""",1.0,epidemiology,True

Objectives: To determine the impact of the pandemic on the incidence of select immunologic and oncologic diseases compared to prepandemic period in the US. Methods: In the US Optum claims database we identified all enrolled individuals who were  18 years of age between Jan 2018 and Aug 2021. We identified incident cases of cancers [colorectal (CRC), breast (BCA), and lung (NSCLC)], multiple sclerosis (MS), atopic dermatitis (AD), and asthma during the study period using first instance of relevant ICD-10 codes (index date). We excluded patients who had < 6 months of enrollment or disease of interest before the index date. Each calendar year was classified into Winter (Dec/Jan/Feb), Spring (March/April/May), Summer (June/July/Aug), and Fall (Sept/Oct/Nov) period, to account for seasonality of COVID-19. We calculated cumulative incidence for each disease for each period. We reported change in incidence using 2018 as the reference seasons to determine trends before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: We identified ~18 million patients eligible for the study for each cohort. We found that incidence of almost all selected diseases decreased during the pandemic compared to the same period in year 2018. Compared to the corresponding period in 2018 the reported incidence of MS cases decreased between 17% and 83% from March 2020 and August 2021. During the same time period the incidence of cancers decreased between 40% and 86% for CRC, 49% and 91% for BCA, and 25% and 85% for NSCLC, respectively. The incidence of asthma decreased between 12% and 64%, with sharp declines occurring in line with COVID waves. The incidence of AD declined sharply in spring 2020 (17%), however relative to 2018 there was generally no sustained decrease in incidence. In general, the pattern followed the restrictions put forth by the government in response to the COVID-19 waves except for summer 2021 when the incidence rates were the lowest for most diseases in spite of limited social restrictions. Conclusions: COVID-19 led to an apparent decrease in the incidence of most selected diseases; the change followed the pattern of COVID-19 social restrictions. The decrease could be due to reduced screening or limited encounters of mild cases of the diseases. The results suggest that future studies using data from 2020-2021 should exercise caution while interpreting incidence or prevalence data. In addition, more research is required to facilitate understanding the profile of patients who were newly diagnosed in contrast to those who were not, to comprehend implications for external validity.",1.0,pandemic,True

2168,"Background: Pharmacoepidemiologic studies often involve use of real-world data, which are challenged by various sources of bias, including confounding, selection bias, and information bias. Use of negative controls to address bias, while not a new concept, has recently gained more attraction in drug safety and effectiveness studies. Nevertheless, to what extent these methods have been applied in pharmacoepidemiology studies is not well known. Objectives: To evaluate the state of use and utility of negative controls in pharmacoepidemiologic studies. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Dissertations and Theses Global for the published literature through September 2020 on drug safety and effectiveness studies that deployed negative controls to address potential bias. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and abstracted data. We summarized the studies based on the utility of negative controls and identified the approaches for testing the underlying assumptions of negative controls. Results: We identified 177 eligible articles. Most studies were published after 2013 (167, 94%). Cohort study accounted for 64% (114), followed by case-control studies (18, 10%) and self-control case series (10, 6%). Administrative data (111, 63%) and electronic health records (60, 34%) were the most common data sources used in these studies. Ninety (51%) studies used negative control outcome only, 55 (31%) used negative control exposure only, and 28 (16%) used both. Negative controls were applied mainly to address unmeasured confounding (88, 50%), with fewer addressing selection bias (8, 5%), information bias (6, 3%), or competition bias (1, 1%). We identified four domains of the utility of negative controls: 1) detection of bias (173, 98%), 2) correction of bias with regard to point estimate or confidence interval calibration (15, 8%), 3) p-value calibration (12, 7%), and 4) performance comparison of different analytical methods used in drug safety and effectiveness studies (23, 13%). We summarized the systematic steps to examine the underlying assumptions for negative controls. Conclusions: The use of negative controls in pharmacoepidemiologic studies are mainly to detect bias due to unmeasured confounding. Lacking in many studies was empirical tests of the underlying assumptions. Negative controls are a powerful method but to ensure rigorous and widespread application, future work is needed to empirically test underlying assumptions or explore innovative approaches with less restrictive assumptions.",1.0,negative,True

However, the robustness of the research is dependent on the validity of diagnoses used to identify the key clinical endpoints. Objectives: To understand and evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic algorithms in routine health data relevant for COVID-19 research. Methods: We conducted a literature search for validation studies published in English between 2015 to 2020 using North American or Western European routine health data, which assessed cardiovascular, thromboembolic, respiratory and systematic inflammatory events of interest to both COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics as listed by the Safety Platform for Emergency Vaccines (SPEAC). We included studies with a Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) score >7 that reported positive predictive values (PPV). We extracted the study population, data source, codes, algorithm, reference standard, PPV and calculated median and interquartile ranges for the PPVs found. Results: We identified 43 studies. The events most commonly validated were myocardial infarction (MI), thromboembolic events and stroke. The median PPV for identifying MI was 80% (IQR 22%) (n , 13 studies). The PPVs for venous thromboembolism (VTE) were more variable (range 31%-92; median 73%; n ,"" 11 studies). Within VTE, the median PPV for pulmonary embolism was higher than for deep-vein thrombosis. We observed PPVs >70% for atrial fibrillation (AF) (n "","" 5). The PPVs for general stroke were variable, but highest for ischaemic stroke (PPVs for ischaemic stroke 85%; n "","" 2 studies). Several events of interest (arrythmias, pneumonitis, myocarditis, respiratory distress syndrome) had only a single validation study available; while others events of interest critical in the early pandemic period (cytokine release syndrome and multi organ dysfunction syndrome) had none. Data on renal failure were difficult to interpret due to lack of uniform definitions across studies. Conclusions: Accurate validated algorithms were available for MI, VTE, ischaemic stroke and AF, while there was considerable variability in PPV for general stroke depending on the data source and healthcare setting. There remains a lack of validation studies for many cardiovascular, respiratory and systemic adverse clinical events that emerged of interest during the early part of the pandemic.

Objectives: To assess the impact of Tea & CrêPE Reading Club on students' learning and to collect feedback on the operation of the club. Methods: From October 2021 to January 2022, in this cross-school, student-led journal reading club, the first series of readings featuring eight online meetings to explore basic method and bias from 11 articles among the 30 must-read materials. A self-reported survey was conducted to obtain feedback from attendees with all evaluations voluntary and anonymous. We collected baseline characteristics including sex, age, and educational background and used the Likert scale to assess the level of understanding of the terminologies and the papers, and the level of comprehension and interest in PE studies. The scores from 0 to 10 indicated the poorest to perfect level of each question. Also, checkboxes were designed to survey the pros and cons of the club. Paired t-test was performed to compare the differences in scores before and after joining the club. Meanwhile, students were free to provide additional suggestions on the overall activity. Results: A total of 24 students completed the survey; most of them were graduate students in master's or PhD programs. The level of understanding of the terminologies and papers significantly increased from 3.9 to 5.9 and 3.5 to 5.6 (p < 0.01), respectively. The level of comprehension and interest in PE studies also increase significantly (4.0 to 5.8 and 5.0 to 6.5; p < 0.01). They gained the most knowledge from the papers, which introduced study design and bias. However, the papers with the topics of misclassification and research philosophy were relatively difficult for the attendees.

2181,"Background: Following the US transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD10-CM in 2015, the number of codes for chronic inflammatory arthritis increased from 9 to 193. It is unclear how this transition affected diagnoses of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) within claims databases. Objectives: Determine how the ICD transition affected the identification of incident JIA diagnosis, including by JIA type and treatment. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, eligible members were commercial health plan members from the HealthCore Integrated Research Database <18 years old enrolled January 2006 to February 2020 with 6 months of enrollment and no prior rheumatic disease or immunosuppression. Diagnosis of JIA was based on ICD-9-CM algorithms previously used or validated in other claims data. Initial cohort identification was performed using a Sentinel Initiative modular program. Poisson and negative binomial regressions adjusting for calendar time, month post-switchover, ICD era, and seasonality were performed. Incidence rates (95% confidence intervals) are expressed per 100 000 members per month. Results: We identified 6260 and 2308 incident JIA diagnoses using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes, respectively. Mean age at diagnosis was 12 years (SD 4.8); differences by sex (64% female) and JIA type were consistent with known JIA epidemiology. The monthly incidence of diagnosed JIA did not change within either coding era but declined abruptly at the ICD-9/10-CM transition from 1.57 (1.55, 1.59) to 1.33 (1.30, 1.37). When stratified by JIA type, incidence declined for seronegative poly- or oligoarticular JIA [1.21 (1.19, 1.22) to 0.93 (0.90, 0.95)] and juvenile spondyloarthritis [0.27 (0.27, 0.28) to 0.23 (0.22, 0.24)] but doubled for systemic JIA (0.06 to 0.12); the incidence of seropositive JIA was slightly increased [0.052 (0.051, 0.053) to 0.067 (0.065, 0.069)]. The incidence of JIA without attendant drug claims declined (33% to 27%), whereas incident JIA treated with biologics within 6 months of diagnosis increased abruptly (25% to 35%), despite no market changes around the transition. Among members diagnosed with JIA by ICD-9-CM but not ICD-10-CM (N ,"" 1270) despite continued enrollment after 2015, common alternate diagnoses included anxiety, fatigue, non-specific musculoskeletal pain, and headaches. Conclusions: The incidence of diagnosed JIA, both overall and without expected medical treatment, declined abruptly at the US ICD-9/10-CM transition, with apparent reclassification of some persons to diagnoses consistent with chronic pain disorders. Increases in certain JIA subgroups were noted, including systemic JIA and biologic-treated JIA, suggesting improved diagnostic specificity with ICD-10-CM codes.""",1.0,disease,True

2188,"Background: Validation substudies are an important component of pharmacoepidemiology studies using claims-based algorithms for outcome assessment. However, conventional approaches to validation substudy design (i.e., simple random sample, balanced design) recommend sampling participants once follow-up has been completed. The adaptive validation approach allows for prospective monitoring of validation data, enabling detection of a time trend and subsequent adjustment to the validation approach. Objectives: To evaluate performance of the adaptive validation approach in detecting time trends in classification parameters and to develop recommendations for sampling validation data to account for time trends in outcome misclassification. Methods: We simulated 10 000 datasets in which 100 000 cohort members were enrolled over a 5-year period and followed for two years for occurrence of an event. In each simulated cohort, we assumed an exposure prevalence of 20% and the true 2-year risk of the outcome in the exposed to be 10% and 5% in the unexposed. A time trend in outcome misclassification was induced in each simulated cohort by manipulating the degree of change in outcome misclassification over time and assuming that misclassification decreased over time. Blocks of 10 participants by observed outcome status within strata of the exposure were sampled in order of outcome ascertainment and classification parameters were computed using a betabinomial Bayesian model to iteratively update the positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively). Results: In our preliminary simulation results, we observed a positive time trend in the classification parameters, as expected. The ability of the adaptive validation approach to detect a time trend in the classification parameters was dependent on the degree of change in outcome misclassification. Conclusions: Our simulation results support the need for analysing changes in validation parameters over the follow-up period. When a time trend in classification parameters exists, conventional validation approaches using a single summary classification parameter value will misrepresent the classification accuracy over most of the study's outcome ascertainment period.",1.0,epidemiology,True

However, other models have been less investigated, especially those exploiting the potential of large databases. Objectives: To compare the performances of machine learning (ML) models in predicting use of PIMs and quantifying the associated factors, in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: This is a retrospective population-based cohort study using medico-administrative databases (Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System) in the province of Quebec, Canada. The study population is older adults (at least 66 years old) alive and covered by the public drug insurance plan from April first, 2015 to March 3first, 2016. We used logistic regression, random forests, neural networks, gradient boosting machines, and naïve Bayes to predict PIM use. The latter is a binary outcome defined as having at least one prescribed PIM, based on the 2015 Beers criteria. Potential predictors included age, sex, residential status (urban/rural), material and social deprivation indices, number of hospitalizations in 2015, and chronic diseases. Performance metrics were sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predicted values (NPV), and area under the curve (AUC); relative variable importance was measured for each model. Data were separated in training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. Results: Out of 1 105 295 older adults, 533 719 were PIM users (48.3%). No imbalanced issue, which can negatively affect prediction, was thus observed. Performances according to AUC, PPV, and NPV were similar across the five investigated models (mean values: 0.62, 0.52, and 0.70 respectively), while sensitivity and specificity ranged from 0.38 to 0.52, and from 0.70 to 0.80 respectively. Overall, the two most (least) important variables for prediction were being a woman and anxiety-depressive disorders (heart failure and deprivation indices). Conclusions: No model clearly outperformed the others. Furthermore, the investigated models yielded similar results in the ranking of prediction variables. ML models may help slightly refine predictions, but other variables may be more helpful in the case of PIM use prediction. Other settings could also be more favorable to ML models, such as unbalanced outcomes or use of only continuous predictors.",1.0,community,True

Methods: We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and the Cochrane Library were searched with no time restrictions until 13 July 2021. Papers were searched using 42 predefined keywords and 7 medical subject headings based on the presence of 1) routinely collected healthcare data 2) a pharmacoepidemiologic drug safety focus and 3) a signal detection related keyword, limited to original research and reviews. Results: Of 1765 reviewed studies, 101 studies and 15 reviews were eligible for inclusion. Methods included adaptations of disproportionality measures normally associated with spontaneous reports, traditional epidemiological designs, methods specific to signal detection with RWD, such as temporal pattern discovery, and implementations of machine learning. Performance assessment was often reported in terms of area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) with a range of positive and negative controls. 7 studies presented AUC values for more than one method and a range of drug-outcome pairs, in which a total of 13 methods were used. No study compared all 13 methods. The reported AUCs ranged from 0.47 to 0.81. No method consistently outperformed all other methods. 9 papers reported AUCs for subsets of drugs and outcomes. They reported both qualitative and quantitative findings at drug or outcome level. Higher AUCs were achieved for individual outcomes compared to the average measures, up to 0.94 for the self-controlled case series with acute renal failure. Different databases, reference sets, analytic configurations, metrics and definitions for the exposures and outcomes were used for performance assessment. Conclusions: A variety of methods have been described in the literature for signal detection with RWD. Although no method showed superior performance in each study it was evaluated in, and across all drugs and diseases, there is some suggestion that self-controlled designs can achieve better results, particularly with acute outcomes. However, limited inference can be drawn on comparative performance of methods across studies given the heterogeneity of methods evaluations.

Health insurance claims databases provide an opportunity to study uncommon complications, such as VTE, in a large RA population. To date, however, no prior studies have validated an algorithm based on ICD-10-CM codes. Objectives: To evaluate the performance of health insurance claims data for identifying VTE among patients treated for RA. Methods: The study included adults aged 18 years with commercial or Medicare Advantage insurance with Part D (MAPD) who received treatment for RA between 01 May 2016-30 November 2020 and had an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for RA. After a 6-month covariate assessment window and evidence of a biologic or targeted synthetic DMARD, patients were observed for 1 month. Observation time ended on disenrollment from the health plan, occurrence of a presumptive VTE, or the end of the study period (31 December 2020). Patients with a presumptive VTE were identified based on an algorithm using ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, drug dispensing records, and type of care setting, adapted from a prior publication. Clinical data from the patient's medical chart was abstracted to confirm the VTE diagnosis using pre-specified clinical confirmation rules. The validity of the algorithm to identify VTE was assessed by calculating the positive predictive value (PPV). Results: Patient charts were procured from treating providers for 155 of 254 patients (61%) identified with the pre-specified VTE algorithm. The majority of patients were female (74%), with mean age 66 years (standard deviation [SD] 11), and MAPD insurance (81%). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (27%), ever smoking (56%), hypertension (72%), obesity (47%), and prior evidence of VTE (28%) were common. Follow-up ranged from 51-1704 days (mean 912; SD 525 days). The PPV for the VTE algorithm was 75% (117/155; 95% CI 69-82%) using information in available medical charts as the reference standard.

Objectives: To identify unusual site TTS within administrative claims or EHR databases using ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, and to validate the algorithm using clinical information in EHRs within the network of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) Initiative. Methods: Based on literature review and clinical input, we developed an algorithm based on ICD-10-CM codes for unusual site TTS as a composite outcome--first recorded ICD 10-CM final or discharge diagnosis in the inpatient (IP) or emergency department (ED) setting indicating an unusual site thrombosis, with a co-occurring final or discharge diagnosis for thrombocytopenia in the IP, ED, or outpatient setting within 14 days of the thrombosis diagnosis. Patients with potential TTS were identified using the claims-based algorithm in the EHR database of an academic health network. Validation occurred for up to 50 cases at each thrombosis site. Positive predictive value (PPV) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using pathology or imaging results in EHRs as the gold standard, per an interim Brighton Collaboration definition. Results: A random sample of 50 of 211 cases of portal vein TTS was selected for validation and all cases of other unusual site TTS were validated, for a total of 117 events. Among 113 patient records with sufficient information for validation of both components of the diagnosis, the overall algorithm PPV was 76% (95% CI 67%-83%; 86 of 113 records with imaging and platelet count results). Overall, the PPV for the diagnosis of the thrombocytopenia component (98%, 95% CI: 92%-99%; 112 of 115 records with platelet count results) was higher than for the diagnosis of the thrombosis component (76%, 95% CI: 67%-83%; 87 of 115 records with imaging results). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a validated ICD-10-CM-based algorithm for unusual site TTS.

Sources of bias were described using additional questionnaire data including self-reported vaccination and infection onset dates, COVID-19 symptoms, co-morbidities and extreme vulnerability to COVID-19, care home status, household size and type, vaccine delay and reasons, and mixing Behaviors after vaccination. The original analysis was updated to adjust for potential biases. Results: 8648 individuals (response 36.1%) were included. There was minimal evidence of exposure and outcome misclassification, confounding by comorbidities, riskier Behavior after vaccination or vaccination itself associated with COVID-19. Additional adjustment for potential confounding by household size, type and clinical vulnerability decreased the final reported VE estimate from 88% (95% CI: 79%- 94%) to 87% (95% CI: 78%-93%) after a second dose of BNT162b2. The follow-up for patients with ChAdOx1-S was too short to assess. Health-seeking Behavior markers were not available to assess potential confounding or collider bias. Assessment of healthy vaccinee bias from vaccine delay was limited since it was difficult to determine an accurate COVID-19 onset date. Conclusions: Early TND COVID-19 VE studies appear robust to several biases, however, the current study was limited by questionnaire responses and data available. Further research is required to assess the robustness of TND and other observational studies to confounding by health-seeking Behavior, collider bias, and healthy vaccinee bias from vaccine delay.",1.0,negative,True

2225,"Objectives: To give insights and tentative recommendations on statistical analyzes to perform for coming observational studies not assessing C19 using EHR during the C19 pandemic period. Methods: Sources of bias will be highlighted in the context of C19 pandemic with two different focuses: the measure of incidence of pathologies and the association between an exposure and an outcome. The statistical analyzes to evaluate the magnitude of these biases and to account for them will be described. An illustration on surgical data will be provided. Results: The incidence estimation of diseases is expected to decrease in 2020-2021 compared to previous years, due to a bias of detection. Instead of providing the observed number of incident cases, the expected number of new cases could be produced using projections with temporal series or age-cohort-period models. The temporal series of weekly/monthly number of newly exposed patients and patients with outcome are compared with the same series identified on several previous years. Hypotheses behind significant changes should be evaluated (pandemic burden on medical resources, lock-down, social distancing). Confounding bias may occur if C19 affects outcome and exposure. Before/after designs should be avoided and case-control preferred. The estimation should be performed overall and by civil year using mixed models.

The latter uses a weighting approach that is complementary to observational causal inference methodology applied to real world external comparators. This yields estimation of marginal hazard ratios and survival distributions. We implement our proposed methodology to estimate these parameters in simulation studies of left truncated data where entry and survival times are marginally dependent, but independent conditional on measured confounders. We also illustrate estimation of the marginal survival distribution for patients with metastatic prostate cancer in a real world clinico-genomic database. Results: Our simulation studies show unbiased estimation and valid confidence interval coverage for conditional hazard ratios, marginal hazard ratios, and marginal survival distributions. In contrast, standard methods for left truncation show heavy bias and lack of coverage given a confounded association between survival and entry times. In our application, we found evidence of conditionally independent left truncation among a cohort of patients with metastatic prostate cancer who received comprehensive genomic profiling. A standard risk set adjusted Kaplan-Meier analysis estimates a median survival time of 17.8 months (95% CI [16.5, 19.3]) after first-line therapy. Using a nontruncated dataset, we estimate density ratio weights to account for the confounders identified. A subsequent weighted analysis estimates a median survival time of 16.5 months (95% CI [15.1, 18.1]), indicating an overestimate of survival when conditionally independent left truncation is not properly accounted for.

2258,"Background: The use of routinely collected health and prescriptions data for pharmacoepidemiology is a growing domain, which can overcome some of the challenges of feasibility and generalisability faced by randomized-controlled trials. However, there is a lack of consistency between researchers in the use of codelists to identify cases, interventions and outcomes, data management and analytic methods, which can lead to inconsistent findings. Objectives: To address issues of consistency, transparency and reproducibility in the use of routine data for pharmacoepidemiology, we are co-producing an online knowledge hub. The purpose of the hub will be to promote open science, share learning and facilitate collaborations. The hub will be the first of its kind in the pharmacoepidemiology domain. In the hub's first phase of development, described here, we aimed to consult multidisciplinary pharmacoepidemiology researchers on the following objectives: i - Is there demand for an online knowledge hub? ii - What features would the online knowledge hub need to have to be of use to the research community? Methods: Over the space of 12 months, we promoted a 3 online events via the UCL e-Research domain, with attendees from 12 universities across 5 countries. The events consisted of seminars and problem solving workshops. In the first two events, we surveyed 120 delegates to establish whether there was demand for an online knowledge hub and to identify features that would be of use to the research community. In the third event, we held a workshop to build on the features for the online hub identified in the surveys, and to coproduce a blueprint for the online pages. Results: 100% of event delegates surveyed agreed there would be demand for the online knowledge hub. Three main themes for proposed features of the online knowledge hub were agreed upon during the workshop: 1) An open science platform to share and review codelists/data management coding templates/statistical analysis code, used in pharmacoepidemiology studies; 2) A resource library with information on data sources, training on data management and",1.0,epidemiology,True

Methods: We identified patients with new prescriptions for biologics or targeted therapies (e.g. janus kinase inhibitors) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from rheumatologists in the Illumination Health RealWorld Evidence Platform (EHR data) linked to either fee-for-service Medicare or commercial health plan data. The first prescription in EHR data for each medication anchored the index date. We required  12 months of medical and pharmacy coverage in claims data prior to index. We tested 6 new user definitions that required a rheumatologist office visit, any prescription in EHR data, or both, either  12 or  24 months prior to index.

However, these studies did not generate measures of absolute risk under complete adherence to these treatment strategies Objectives: To estimate the per-protocol effect of adhering to the following treatment strategies on 12-year risk of dementia: (1) initiation of AD with AC properties (""AC AD"") and continuation for 4 months, until the development of a contraindication, or (2) initiation of AD without AC properties (""non-AC AD"") and continuation for 4 months, until the development of an indication, or (3) no initiation of AD over follow-up Methods: We used CPRD GOLD electronic health records of UK adults aged 50 years without a diagnosis for dementia or cognitive impairment and with no use of antidepressants in the last 12 months to emulate a sequence of 204 nested target trials, beginning in each of the months between 2001-2017. In the baseline month of each emulated trial, we classified individuals into one of three strategies: ""AC AD"" initiators, ""non-AC AD"" initiators, and non-initiators. Individuals were censored if and when they deviated from their assigned treatment strategy. We used pooled logistic regression to estimate the per-protocol effect of these strategies on incident dementia via 12-year risk differences (RD) and risk ratios (RR), adjusting for baseline and post-baseline variables using inverse-probability weighting Results: Eligible individuals included 29 408 initiators of AC AD (80 329 person-years of follow-up), 19 753 initiators of non-AC AD (58 728 person-years of follow-up), and a selected random sample of 1 114 975 non-initiators of AD (5 608 493 person-years of followup). The estimated 12-year risk (95% CI) of dementia was 5.7% (4.4%; 7.5%) under the ""AC AD"" strategy, 6.2% (4.3%; 7.5%) under the ""nonAC AD"" strategy, and 5.5% (5.0%; 6.0%) under the ""no AD"" strategy.

2280,"Background: Propensity score matching (PSM) is widely used for confounding adjustment in real world evidence (RWE) studies evaluating outcomes associated with drug use in routine care. However, it has an important limitation of removing unmatched observations from the analysis, potentially leading to increased covariate imbalance, reduced sample size and limited generalizability. In contrast, weighting on the propensity score has several advantages, including increased precision through retaining most observations and flexibility for targeting specific populations for inference. The FDA's Sentinel System recently added inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) for confounding adjustment in comparative safety and effectiveness studies. Objectives: To evaluate IPTW in a distributed data network by comparing adjusted effect estimates obtained using a PSM approach versus an IPTW approach in the Sentinel System for a study of stroke and bleeding risk in patients aged 65 years or older initiating nonvitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOAC) for atrial fibrillation. Methods: Patients aged 65 years and older initiating NOACs (rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban) between 10/19/2010 and 9/30/2015 in the Sentinel Medicare data partner were identified. PSM (1:1) and IPTW with stabilized average treatment effect weights were used separately for each pairwise NOAC-NOAC comparison. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the outcomes of thromboembolic stroke (stroke), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), major extracranial bleeding (MEB), and GI bleeding (GIB) comparing each NOAC with each other. Results: Overall, the point estimates and 95% CIs were similar between the analyzes using PSM and IPTW. For example, there was no difference in the risk of stroke comparing rivaroxaban versus dabigatran after adjustment using PSM (HR [95% CI]: 0.89 [0.74, 1.07]) or IPTW (0.90 [0.76, 1.06]). Similarly, rivaroxaban use was associated with a numerical but nonsignificant increased risk of ICH compared to apixaban in both analyzes [PSM HR (95% CI) 1.28 (0.99, 1.67) and IPTW 1.23 (0.96, 1.58)].

2291,"Background: Defining mental health (MH) conditions with data collected from primary care is challenging. Researchers have addressed this by using validated algorithms and code lists. Algorithms detect and integrate different data types (e.g., diagnosis codes and drug treatment records) to define if the patient has an MH condition. A list of medical codes (e.g., diagnoses and symptoms) usually supplies these algorithms to improve their accuracy. The code lists validation is frequently a qualitative process (e.g., clinical review) and can demand additional external information, increasing costs, logistics and data management. Objectives: To validate code lists for defining common MH conditions with primary care data, using a mixed qualitative and quantitative approach and without recurring to external data. Methods: Using a mixed approach, we validated a Read codes list created to define common MH conditions in patients registered in the UK primary care system (The Health Improvement Network (THIN) data). The goal was to select valid Read codes to retain in the list and classify these codes in clusters defining MH conditions. The qualitative step included an in-depth revision of the codes by a panel of six doctors (3 general practitioners and 3 psychiatrists). Simultaneously, the quantitative step included different statistical analyzes on THIN data (i.e., exploratory factor analysis (EFA), cluster analysis) for reaching the same goal. The statistical results informed the preliminary qualitative conclusions (e.g., correspondence analysis), generating a final selection and classification. Finally, we contrasted the classification against appropriate drug treatment to verify consistency. Results: From a preselected list of 2007 Read codes, a total of 1638 were selected by all doctors. Later, they agreed on classifying these codes into 12 categories of common MH disorders. From the same preselected list, a total of 1364 were quantitatively selected. Using data from 497 649 persons who used these Read codes at least once, we performed the EFA, retaining five factors (5 categories) from the unrotated factorial solution. Both classifications showed good correspondence, informing a final classification strongly correlated with drug treatment, for example, for severe mental illnesses and cognitive decline. Conclusions: We produced a comprehensive set of medical codes lists for 12 common MH conditions validated by a combination of clinical consensus panel and quantitative cluster analysis with cross-validation. The mixed qualitative and quantitative approach maximizes benefits from internal data, avoiding extra costs and logistics from external data collection/recovery in validating MH code lists.",1.0,clinical,True

Results: On January first, 2018, 3 466 321 persons were included in PHARMO's GP population (mean age: 41.6 years, 49.7% males). The sex and age distribution was similar to the Dutch population. Regarding medication use, only the pharmacological subgroups `viral vaccines' and `hormonal contraceptives for systemic use' differed (SD >0.2); use in PHARMO's GP population was higher compared to the Dutch population. These differences were explained by the fact that `viral vaccines' and `hormonal contraceptives for systemic use' are not completely reimbursed via the basic health insurance. No differences were observed regarding diagnoses. Mortality was lower in PHARMO's GP population than in the Dutch population, which is in line with expectations. Persons who die are more often older and no longer under the care of a GP (i.e. institutionalized). Conclusions: The GP Data of the PHARMO Data Network are representative of the Dutch population regarding demographic characteristics and provided primary care in terms of medication use and diagnoses.

Objectives: To report on the selection for a scoping review to identify literature describing recommendations, or tools to describe, report on or leverage HDS for pharmacoepidemiologic research. Methods: We identified relevant literature published up to end 2021. We first selected a set of core papers, based on the expertise of the co-authors. We then executed three steps: 1) a snowball search of the reference lists of the core papers, 2) a PubMed search and 3) a webbased search for gray literature. Documents were reviewed in a standardized process by independent pairs of reviewers; first title and abstract (TIAB), then full text review (FTR) if TIAB was of interest. We excluded documents if they met any of the following criteria: 1) described only clinical trials and not observational (or routinely collected) data sources, 2) reported only statistical methods to handle heterogeneity in results (e.g. meta-analysis), 3) applied pharmacoepidemiologic studies that were not focussed on methodology or providing guidance, 4) papers otherwise out of scope (e.g. pre-clinical studies). We included documents if they reported at least one of the following: 1) relevant descriptions of multiple data sources, 2) tools to report on HDS, 3) strategies to use HDS to improve evidence, 4) guidance on reporting HDS.

It is unclear if hospitalized days that are fully covered by Medicare Part A, which requires no copay/co-insurance for days 2-60, are consistently reflected in databases that rely on Medicare Supplemental insurance data that only contain claims for services covered at least in part by the supplemental plan. Objectives: We compared length of stay (LOS) for hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 90-day readmission rates between fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare claims from CMS and FFS Medicare Supplemental claims from IBM MarketScan (MKS). Methods: We conducted parallel analyzes in MKS and a 20% sample of CMS Medicare claims. We identified patients' (66+ yrs) first hospital admission for AMI between 2007 and 2017, requiring evidence of at least 365-days of continuous enrollment in an employer-sponsored supplemental FFS insurance plan and prescription drug coverage. Patients were followed until the first of hospital readmission, death, disenrollment, or reaching 90-days post discharge. We compared LOS, defined as the number of nights of the index admission, and 90-day readmission rates between the cohorts. We explored 2 methods of identifying inpatient stays in the MKS data. The first relied solely on admission and discharge dates from the inpatient admission and services files. The second incorporated inpatientspecific evaluation & management CPT codes with an inpatient place of service found in the outpatient services file. We evaluated the impact of the second method on the LOS and estimated 90-day risk of readmission. Results: We identified 12 753 and 67 633 patients in CMS and MKS, respectively. Mean age (CMS: 77.8, MKS: 77.6) and percent female (CMS: 40.1%, MKS: 41.4%) were similar. The mean LOS in CMS was 3.7d; 21.2% of patients were readmitted within 90 days. When relying",1.0,,True

Objectives: To assess the impact of misclassifying certain discharge dispositions as censoring or competing events on the estimation of inhospital mortality incidence in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: Using hospital chargemaster data from 297 hospitals in the United States, we identified adults admitted with a COVID-19 diagnosis between May 01, 2020 and August 15, 2021. Hospital discharge disposition was classified as: home, hospice, hospital transfer, longterm care facility, or death. Our outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality due to COVID-19 infection. We considered patients transferring hospitals to still be at risk of severe disease, and patients discharged to long-term care facilities to no longer be at severe risk. We estimated the cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality at 30 days under the following scenarios: (1) censor all discharges with dispositions other than death; (2) treat all discharges with dispositions other than death as competing events; (3) treat discharge home as competing event, censor at hospital transfer, long-term care facility, and hospice; (4) treat discharge home or to a long-term care facility as competing events, censor at hospital transfer and hospice.

Objectives: The current study compared non-large-scale PSM and CM in terms of post-match patient retention, covariate balance and residual confounding at progressively smaller sample sizes. Methods: We identified new users of -blockers versus angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) monotherapy between 10-01- 2014 and 01-01-2017 from the IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Claims and Encounters database (index,""first drug exposure).

Matching covariates (n "","" 37) included patient demographic and select clinical characteristics. Observed covariates included patient demographics, and all observed prior conditions, drug exposures, and procedures. Expected absolute systematic error (EASE), a summary measure of expected systematic error, was assessed using 105 negative control outcome experiments perceived as unassociated with the treatment. All analyzes were conducted within a 10% and 0.25% sample group consisting of 5 and 200 subsample draws, respectively. Results: A total of 186 233 (-blocker: 56 871; ACEI: 129 362) patients meeting the study criteria were identified. CM achieved superior patient retention and matching covariate balance in both sample groups. After PSM, an average of 1.6% and 15.3% of matching covariates were imbalanced in the 10% and 0.25% sample groups, respectively. There was no evidence of a significant differences in observed covariate balance between PSM and CM; however, CM with more stringent balance criteria (e.g., SMD < 0.01) was associated with a significant reduction in EASE as compared to PSM. Conclusions: We recommend CM with more stringent balance criteria be considered as an alternative to PSM when using a small set of matching covariates.""",1.0,clinical,True

2322,"Background: In UTMOST, a cohort study comparing partial vs total knee replacement, we were able to replicate the results of an RCT using propensity score stratification and inverse probability weighting. However, instrumental variables (IV) based on surgeon's preference failed, yielding implausible estimates. This is despite these IVs fulfilling two pre-specified conditions: they were strong instruments and they balanced known confounders (all with an ASMD<0.1). Objectives: To estimate bias and coverage of preference-based IV analyzes and of a Synthetic IV in plasmode simulated datasets. To explore if known confounders, all of them balanced in falsification tests, could be driving the bias. Methods: Plasmode simulation, a re-sampling method with replacement that can keep the confounding structure of the data. Data was re-sampled from the original UTMOST effectiveness study. We used surgeon preference as present in the dataset as an IV and constructed a totally synthetic IV with a similar shape as the real-world IV. Both continuous IVs were dichotomised on median. Exposure was created as a function of the IV and known confounder effects, with different IV strengths. The outcome was created as a function of a predefined true treatment effect and the known confounder effects. We compared the bias and coverage of the real-world IV and the Synthetic IV on the estimation of treatment effects in a two-stage least squares regression. We explored the same metrics in the real-world IV method, in several simulations, with only introducing the effects of one confounder at a time (instead of the whole list of confounders) from a list of 24 hand-picked known confounders. Results: Synthetic IV coverage was optimal for all IV strengths, with 96% (88% - 91%) coverage, but a relative bias of 100%, with an IV strength OR ,"" 50. The real-world IV coverage was systematically bad for all strengths, with 55% (52% to 58%) for the same OR "","" 50 IV strength and a relative bias of 350%. After repeating the simulation of the real-world IV with one single confounder at a time both in the exposure and outcome generation, some variables introduced substantial bias and resulted in a coverage lower than 80%: for pre-operative knee score (221% bias), deprivation (54% bias) and surgeon output (33% bias). Conclusions: The traditional falsification method based on covariate imbalance for known confounders failed to detect confounding. New methods, such as plasmode simulations evaluating the effect of one known confounder at a time could be a useful diagnostic to detect residual confounding. More research is needed to understand the relationships between IV and confounding, especially in surgical and device epidemiology.""",1.0,epidemiology,True

2325,"Background: In pharmaco-epidemiological studies using the claims databases, frailty would be an important confounder among the elderly, as frailty is a clinical state that cannot be captured or measured directly from the claims databases. At present, researchers have developed various algorithms using diagnostic codes in the claims databases to measure frailty. Due to the discrepant definitions of frailty, the measurement methods are different, and its generalizability needs to be addressed. Objectives: To summarizes the latest advances in frailty measurement in claims databases and evaluate the claims-based frailty index (CFI) generalizability. Methods: We used the following academic search engines (""google scholar"", ""Base"", ""Core"" and ""PubMed"") to search claims-based frailty index related articles.

Articles were classified into 4 categories, ""Development and validation"", ""Applications"", ""Review"" and ""Comparison"". The initial search was supplemented by an additional article from the references of the included articles.

Where randomization is not feasible or unethical, the use of an external data source as a comparator is increasingly used. One challenge with an external comparator is identifying a data source that adequately reflects the target trial population. Clinicaltrials.gov is a data source that can be readily used to evaluate the ability of the RW data source to approximate a potential target trial. Objectives: To evaluate the generalizability of potential external comparator data sources to the characteristics of patients enrolled in clinical trials evaluating chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy for Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) using data aggregated through clinicaltrials.gov. Methods: We compared baseline characteristics of DLBCL patients enrolled in trials with CART interventions reported through clinicaltrials.gov to RW data sources: the nationwide (US-based) deidentified electronic health record (EHR)-derived Flatiron Health database and Optum. Trials matching the criteria were extracted from clinicaltrials.gov, along with additional metadata to enable further analysis, combination, and summarization of the subject baseline characteristics. Characteristics using standards-based, categorical taxonomies were combined and nonstandard taxonomies were included where possible to accurately represent the data. DLBCL patients treated with available CART treatments were identified in both Flatiron and Optum using ICD-10 codes and a record of a CART treatment in the patient's clinical record. Baseline characteristics were described using summary statistics and evaluated for clinically meaningful differences. Results: Six clinical trials of CART treatments for DLBCL were identified in the clinicaltrials.gov data base totaling 454 patients. 91 CART treated DLBCL patients were identified in the Flatiron and 109 in Optum. More RW patients were age 65 and older (43%-44%) than trials (0% - 30%). Most patients in both RW and trials were white and male. One trial reported both lymphoma type and line of therapy. One other study reported disease histology. Similar to RW patients, most trial patients had DLBCL subtypes and had 2 or more lines of therapy. Conclusions: Clinicaltrials.gov provides an opportunity to evaluate potential RW data sources to be used as external comparators.

2335,"Background: Decentralized clinical trial (DCT) approaches - that center trial activities around the participant instead of the investigative site - have the potential to improve clinical trial conduct. However, there is limited information on the regulatory acceptance of these strategies. Objectives: To identify opportunities and challenges that impact the implementation and authorization of DCTs from a regulators' perspective. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with European clinical regulators were conducted between May and October 2021. Regulators from 27 European countries were invited. The interview guide included topics on scientific and operational aspects of DCTs. Data were analyzed according to thematic analyzes. Results: Twenty regulators from 11 national competent authorities participated in one of the 15 interviews. Five major themes were identified from the interview data: justification, responsibilities, participant interests, data quality, and future perspectives. The respondents indicated that a scientific justification should underlie a DCT approach depending on the clinical trial context. Although all therapeutic areas may be considered for a DCT, several interviewees indicated that DCTs could be considered particularly in the context of rare diseases, chronic diseases, and low-risk clinical trials. In addition, participant safety and investigator oversight should be safeguarded when in-person visits are limited and when involving third parties. The respondents recognized the potential of DCTs to recruit participants who would not participate in a conventional clinical trial. Nevertheless, several regulators expressed concerns regarding generalizability, increase of missing data, increased variability in trial results, and validation of novel digital endpoints in the context of DCTs. The interviewees indicated that gaining experience with ""decentralized elements"" exerted by combining onsite and decentralized elements, and harmonization across Europe could facilitate the implementation of full DCTs in the future. Conclusions: Key opportunities of DCTs include decreasing participation burden, allowing underserved groups to participate in CTs, and capturing data closer to the real-world. However, maintaining investigator oversight when involving third parties are challenges to the implementation of DCTs. The possible impact of decentralization on the data quality should furthermore be addressed when designing a DCT.

2342,"Background: Studies suggest that use of anticancer drugs (ADs), including platinum-based agents is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI); however, observational studies aiming at estimating the effect of ADs on the risk of AKI are challenged by a lack of active comparator drugs with the same indication and by confounding by indication. The case-time-control design minimizes the time-stable confounding by indication and the effect of time trends of drug use. Objectives: To evaluate the use of case-time-control (CTC) design to mitigate confounding by indication when examining the association between AD use and AKI in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Methods: Using population-based registries, we identified patients diagnosed with CRC in Denmark between 2010 and 2018 with recorded creatinine measurements. We defined AKI according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) creatinine criteria. To investigate the transient impact of ADs on the risk of AKI events within two years after cancer diagnosis, we compared the incidence of AKI after AD administration (any type and oxaliplatin) using a CTC design, with the periods 1-30 and 61-90 days before AKI serving as the hazard and comparison period, respectively. For each case, we identified 5 controls matched on stage and year of cancer diagnosis. We excluded AKI events in the first 90 days after cancer diagnosis to ensure relevant hazard and comparison periods. In a sensitivity analysis, this period was increased to 180 days. A priori, we expected a transient increased incidence of AKI after AD administration, i.e., the odds ratios (ORs) from the CTC model would be greater than one. Results: We identified 19 880 CRC patients with data on creatinine measurements and cancer stage. Of them, 8870 (44.6%) received ADs and 1857 (9.3%) developed AKI within 90 days to two years after the cancer diagnosis. The CTC model yielded an OR for AKI of 0.59 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.47--0.75) for AD overall and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.55--1.10) for oxaliplatin in the period 90 days to two years after cancer diagnosis. The ORs for AKI in the period 180 days to two years after cancer diagnosis were 0.98 (95% CI: 0.72--1.33) and 1.34 (95% CI: 0.81--2.20), respectively. Conclusions: The results from the CTC model varied substantially depending on whether AKI events were included from day 90 or day 180. The results from the period 90 days to two years after cancer diagnosis showed a transient unexpected lower risk of AKI after AD administration, indicating that the design of the study is susceptible to timevarying confounding. The variation of the results together with the risk of time-varying confounding complicate the interpretation of the results and indicate that the CTC design may not be suitable in this setting.",1.0,case,True

Results: A total of 65 976 CRC patients (1336 from GENIE-BPC; 552 from TCGA; 32 169 from MarketScan, 31 919 from SEER-Medicare) and a total of 13 985 stage IV CRC patients (647 from GENIEBPC; 90 from TCGA; 8114 from SEER-Medicare; 5134 from MarketScan) were identified. SEER-Medicare had the oldest patient population, mean (SD) age of 77.7 (7.9) years old for CRC and 77.3 (7.8) years old for stage IV CRC. GENIE had the youngest patient population, mean (SD) age of 54.1 (12.6) for CRC and 52.7 (12.1) for stage IV CRC years old. The majority of patients were male (except for SEERMedicare) and of white race across databases, and about half of the patients in TCGA had no race information. GENIE-BPC had the highest proportion of stage IV CRC patients (48.4% vs. other databases 13.8-25.4%) and patients receiving treatments (95.7% vs. 37.6- 59.1%). FOLFOX (+ bevacizumab) is the most common regimen across databases accounting for 47.3-78.5% of patients receiving first line of therapy. Median survival was 94, 36, 44 months (CRC) and 23, 23, 15 months (stage IV CRC) for TCGA, GENIE-BPC after left truncation, and SEER-Medicare databases. Conclusions: Compared to other databases, GENIE-BPC had the youngest CRC patients with the most advanced disease and the largest proportion of patients receiving treatment.

2353,"Background: The genetic variations of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 are associated with the antiplatelet efficacy of clopidogrel. However, guidelines do not recommend routine genetic testing prior to antiplatelet therapy. Also, most studies consist of cardiac indications, but relatively few studies have focused on clopidogrel use in stroke patients in real-life conditions. Objectives: To determine the association between CYP2C19 loss of function (LoF) alleles and the outcome of three-year mortality in a population of clopidogrel users and a subgroup of patients with a history of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). In a secondary analysis, we investigated the event risk only in subjects who were still current users of clopidogrel at the event date. Methods: This inception cohort study included 983 participants from the population-based cohort of the Rotterdam Study who had started clopidogrel during the study period and for whom genetic data were available. The date of the first clopidogrel prescription was the day of entry to the study. The cumulative survival was compared between CYP2C19*2 LoF allele carriers and non-carriers using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimate. We performed a time-to-event analysis of the main outcome of mortality in three years of follow-up. A Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the associations between LoF allele status and mortality in the total population and a non-fatal stroke/TIA subgroup. In a secondary analysis, we investigated this association among the current clopidogrel users. Results: The outcome of 3-years mortality occurred in 139 patients (14.1%) of the total population with a median (IQR) age of 75(67-82) years during follow-up. 30.6% (n , 301) of subjects were CYP2C19*2 LoF allele carriers and the cumulative incidence of 3 years mortality was 17.3% (52 events). The K-M estimate showed significantly lower cumulative survival in the LoF allele carriers than non-carriers (log-rank test p ,"" 0.04) during follow-up. The CYP2C19*2 LoF allele carriers had an increased 3-years mortality risk with a Hazard ratio (HR) of 1.65 (95% CI: 1.16, 2.35) in the fully adjusted model. In the stroke subgroup (292 patients) the risk estimate was greater [HR "","" 2.28 (1.26, 4.12)]. However, in the current users' analysis, this association was not statistically significant [HR: 1.13 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.72)]. Conclusions: Our findings support the role of CYP2C19 variations in the effectiveness of clopidogrel and suggest that in a real-life setting of a European population, LoF CYP2C19*2 allele carriers treated with clopidogrel have a higher risk of mortality in three years of follow-up. We observed a higher estimation of event risk in the subset of people with stroke/TIA.""",1.0,,True

2357,"Background: Contact dermatitis is a common dermatosis and can have both allergic and non-allergic character. Many intrinsic and extrinsic factors (allergic and toxic substances, age, sex, ethnicity, genetic factors, comorbidities) influence the incidence of the disease. It is a skin inflammatory condition that occurs at the spot of contact with a low molecular weight substance or protein in an individual allergic to this substance. Pathogenesis is based on type IV immune reaction with the predominant role of specific lymphocytes Therapeutic options for the same are limited due to the involvement of many unknown factors leading to the disorder which poses a threat to the quality of lives of these patients. Drug repurposing proposes a new window of hope, which could help make their lives better. Objectives: To determine off-label therapeutic possibilities for Contact Eczema. Methods: Geo-databases were used to obtain a list of genes and proteins that are involved in the development and expression of Contact Eczema. The common genes and proteins involved in various pathways were then obtained and checked for their interactions using STRING. The repurposing application was utilized to obtain possible drug targets for these genes, following which the drug targets and their structurally similar counterparts were analyzed through in-silico methods to screen out the drugs with the best docking scores. Results: The genes and proteins that were found linked with Contact Eczema were FLG, S100A7, CCL17, S100A9, and MMP12. The drugs with the possibility of therapeutic repurposing, targeting these were found to be Tasquinimod, Roquinimex, Paquinimod, and Laquinimod. Conclusions: The therapeutic options for CE are limited due to multifactorial etiology. Drug repurposing proposes a new array of hope in patients with CE. This novel computational analysis identified Tasquinimod, Roquinimex, Paquinimod, and Laquinimod as drugs that can be repurposed for CE.",1.0,Contact,True

2364,"Background: Tamoxifen treatment roughly halves the recurrence rate among estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients. Therapeutic efficacy may to some extent hinge on successful biotransformation of tamoxifen to metabolites with higher estrogen receptor affinities. These biotransformation reactions are primarily catalyzed by the CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzymes and each of these enzymes can be inhibited by comedications. Objectives: We evaluated whether tamoxifen-treated premenopausal breast cancer patients have a higher recurrence rate when concomitantly prescribed a drug that potentially inhibits tamoxifen metabolism. Methods: We enrolled a cohort of 5959 premenopausal women diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer between 2002-2011. We divided the cohort into women with estrogen receptor positive tumors who were treated with tamoxifen (ER+/T+) and women with estrogen receptor negative tumors who were not treated with tamoxifen (ERÀ/TÀ). Prescription drug exposures were ascertained from the Danish nationwide prescription registry. We fit Cox regression models and used a Bayesian joint modeling approach to estimate associations of exposure to drugs that are substrates for or inhibitors of CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 with recurrence. Results: In the conventional Cox regression models, concomitant prescription of inhibitors of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 were not associated with recurrence in the ER+/T+ group (CYP2D6: HRadj ,"" 0.98, 95% CI: 0.74, 1.3; CYP2C19: HRadj "","" 0.99, 95% CI: 0.71, 1.4). Inhibition of CYP3A4 was associated with an increased recurrence hazard among ER+/T+ women (HRadj "","" 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1 to 2.0), but not among ERÀ/TÀ women. After incorporating the longitudinal structure of the CYP inhibiting medication with a Bayesian joint modeling framework, users of CYP3A4 inhibiting medication had a reduced estimated rate of recurrence compared with non-users among ER+/T+ women (HRcrude "","" 0.69, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.97). With this approach, concomitant use of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 inhibitors were again not associated with recurrence in the ER+/T+ group (CYP2D6: HRcrude "","" 1.01, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.04; CYP2C19: HRcrude "","" 0.97, 95% CI: 0.93, 1.01). Conclusions: The positive recurrence association seen with CYP3A4 inhibition was specific to the ER+/T+ group, as would be expected for a predictive marker of tamoxifen effectiveness. In the joint modeling approach, CYP3A4 inhibiting medications were associated with a reduced estimated rate of recurrence, suggesting that the association observed in the conventional approach is likely biased.

Objectives: To identify the barriers and facilitators associated with voluntary reporting of adverse drug reactions among community pharmacists. Methods: This prospective study was conducted over a period of six months. The study involved focus group discussions with the community pharmacists practicing in the Mysuru district. The demographic details and study-specific details such as barriers and facilitators for active participation of community pharmacists in adverse drug reactions reporting were documented. The findings were presented descriptively. Results: A total of 205 community pharmacists participated in this study. Lack of recognition of adverse drug reaction reporting as a professional responsibility by the community pharmacists (132, 64.4%), followed by lack of time (42, 20.5%) and assuming adverse drug reaction reporting as the responsibility of physicians (27, 13.2%) were the most common barriers reported by the respondents. Having a userfriendly online reporting system (92, 44.9%) and professional development programs focusing on skills to identify and report adverse drug reactions by community pharmacists (51, 24.9%) were the most common facilitators reported.

2374,"Background: Although cannabis preparations are increasingly available across jurisdictions worldwide, evidence concerning their riskbenefit profile is far from conclusive. Post-marketing monitoring plays an essential role in investigating their safety because of novelty and heterogeneity in formulations and uses. Objectives: Using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), we aim to characterize post-marketing cannabis-related adverse drug events (ADEs). Methods: FAERS quarterly data (January 2004-September 2021) were downloaded and deduplicated to identify cannabis products, namely cannabidiol (CBD), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and cannabinoids not otherwise specified (cannabinoids-NOS). Reports of cannabis-related ADEs were described and compared to other FAERS reports. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated to detect signals of disproportionate reporting for the three different products. Product labels were used to highlight unexpected signals. Results: We retrieved 25 686 cases of cannabis-related ADEs, of which 40.5% involved CBD and 25.5% THC.

However, dearth in literature pertinent to the genetic mutations underlying pathogenesis of RMS and the potential association of other drugs in triggering RMS have been incompletely investigated. Objectives: This study aims to unravel drugs and associated off-label targets (OLTs) which induce RMS by exploiting FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and Pharmacovigilance/Pharmacogenomics In silico Pipeline (PHARMIP). Methods: The case/non-case retrospective observational study design was used for data retrieval and analysis from the FDA database. Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) data mining algorithms were used to evaluate the strength of the signal. A value of ROR-1.96SE>1 (SE-standard error), PRR2 are considered as positive signals.

2452,"Background: Drug induced congenital anomalies can be averted if the health care practitioners of kept informed of the adverse outcomes in pregnant females. Hypospadias are commonly observed with anticonvulsants. In the current study, hypospadias was detected as a new signal for lopinavir. Objectives: The current study explored the medications associated to cause hypospadias by analysing the data mined from the US FDA adverse event reporting system (US FAERS) database. Methods: It is a case-non case study employing the data mining algorithms. A disproportionality analysis was performed to identify the drug event combinations (DEC). The adverse events reported in FAERS were retrieved with the preferred therapeutic term hypospadias. The data was mined from the first quarter of 2006 to November 2021 using the OpenVigil 2.1 database. Proportional reporting ratio (PRR>1) and reporting odds ratio (ROR>2) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and drug event combinations >10 was used as the criteria for predicting the drugs associated to cause hypospadias. Subgroup analysis was done to determine the congenital anomalies. Results: Lopinavir is a protease inhibitor reported to cause congenital hypospadias in the USFDA database. The PRR observed for lopinavir is 18.75 and ROR is 18.8(13.55, 26.07) with 37 events. The medication reported to cause highest PRR is fluphenazine enanthate with PRR 4712.53 and ROR 14315.6(2586.83 77243.26) with 4 events. Anticonvulsants, antivirals and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly reported to cause hypospadias. Among the anticonvulsants, valproate exhibited higher PRR 48.8 and ROR 49.1 with 109 events. Among antivirals, nelfinavir showed 136.55 and ROR 139.12 with 55 events. Among SSRIs, fluoxetine PRR 10.17, ROR 10.18 and drug-event as 20. The subgroup analysis revealed a higher rate of anomalies for tenofovir. Conclusions: Lopinavir associated hypospadias is a new signal generated to alert the health care practitioners to monitor the administration of lopinavir among pregnant females. Lopinavir should be administered with caution in pregnant females with Human immunodeficiency viral infection I.",1.0,case,True

Objectives: To compare, in a large national cohort, the risk of early CIE associated with antipsychotic with strong versus weak 1-adrenergic and 5-HT1A antagonisms. Methods: We performed a population-based cohort study in the General Sample of Beneficiaries (Echantillon Généraliste des Bénéficiaires [EGB]), a random 1/97 permanent sample representative of the French national healthcare insurance database. We assembled a cohort of all adults, new users of antipsychotics with strong 1-adrenergic and 5-HT1A antagonisms (sulpiride, amisulpride, olanzapine, loxapine, aripiprazole, and quetiapine) or weak antagonisms (haloperidol, risperidone, cyamemazine, and chlorpromazine) between January first 2009 and December 31 2018. We used an as-treated exposure definition where patients were considered exposed from the date of the first prescription and censored upon treatment discontinuation or switch. Multivariate and standardized mortality ratios (SMRW) weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of hospitalization for CIE (ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack) associated with strong vs weak antagonists. We estimated the risk of all-cause mortality as a secondary outcome. The study protocol was registered to the European Union electronic Register of PostAuthorization Studies (EUPAS40828). Results: The cohort included 11 865 new users of strong antagonists and 7 478 of weak antagonists, with a total follow-up of 4 474.2 person-years and 2 854.6 person-years, respectively. Our study found a standardized incidence for CIE between 0.61 and 0.45 per 100 person-year respectively for our two groups of exposure. Compared with weak antagonists, use of strong antagonists was not associated with an increased risk of CIE in the multivariate Cox model (HR 1.37 [0.61- 3.04]), and in the weighted Cox model (HR 1.79 [0.96-3.35]). However, use of strong antagonists was associated with an increased risk of death in the three models (HR 3.87 [3.08-4.86]; HR 1.78 [1.41- 2.26] and HR 1.30 [1.13-1.50], respectively).

2462,"Background: Drugs used to treat cardiovascular disorders are associated with the highest rates of medication errors. Patients in the cardiovascular critical care unit (CCCU) are inherently predisposed to high mortality and morbidity rates owing to complex management approaches and deranged physiological parameters. Objectives: To identify and classify medication errors and the associated risk factors among patients with cardiovascular disorders at the CCCU. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) CCCU wards. Approval for this study was granted by the KNH/UoN Ethics Review Committee. Forty patients were selected through convenient sampling. A pre-designed questionnaire was used to extract on patient's sociodemographic and clinical characteristics from their files. Data was analyzed descriptively and inferentially using Microsoft Excel 2016 and STATA version 13.0. Fischer's exact or Pearson's Chi-square tests were used to establish the association between the predictor variables and the medication errors. A regression analysis identified the independent predictors of medication errors at P < 0.05. Results: Most participants were female (55.0%), unemployed (75.0%), and admitted through the outpatient department (50.0%). The mean age was 47.7 (SD: 15.4) years and the average duration of admission was 7.6 (SD: 3.9) days. Hypertension (27.5%), hypertensive urgency (22.5%,), and acute decompensated heart failure (7.5%,) were the primary cardiovascular diagnoses. Ninety-seven prescriptions were reviewed from which 74 medication errors were identified. Most patients had at least one error (95.0%).

Objectives: To describe and compare the profile of ONJ notifications under denosumab (Prolia, Xgeva) and/or bisphosphonates through a two-step analysis in two pharmacovigilance databases. Methods: First, we performed a descriptive clinical analysis and a disproportionality analysis in the French pharmacovigilance database (FPVD) from January 1985 to December 2019, then a disproportionality analysis through the calculation of reporting odds ratio (ROR) in Vigibase, the WHO pharmacovigilance data base on the same period. The cases were selected using the Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQ) ""osteonecrosis"" and the prefered terms (PT) ""osteonecrosis"" and ""osteonecrosis of jaw"". We have eliminated duplicates. Results: Of the 1398 cases obtained by the SMQ on the FNPV, 1120 were selected as ONJ cases: 759 are attributed to bisphosphonates, 290 to the denosumab, and 71 to both. The majority of patients are women (69.73%), mean age 67 +- 12 years, treated for bone metastases (58.66%), in the context of breast cancer (57.69%). With the PT ""Osteonecrosis of jaw"" in the FNPV, the denosumab (XGEVA® form) has the highest ROR 1775.1 (95% CI 1473.3-2138.8) versus 369.5 (95% CI 318.4-428.9) for bisphosphonates, the highest with zoledronate (ROR 264.5, 95% CI 228.1-306.8).

The sources of articles included MEDLINE (n ,"" 8), the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (n "","" 6), Side Effect Resource (n "","" 6), and social media platforms (n "","" 6). The main uses of machine learning in patient safety were in the identification of adverse drug events and reactions (57.6%), processing of safety reports or clinical narratives (21.2%), extraction or prediction of the effects of drug-drug interactions (7.6%), identification of populations at high risk of experiencing drug toxicity or guidance for personalized care (7.6%), prediction of drug side effects (3.0%), simulation of clinical trials (1.5%), and integration of prediction uncertainties into diagnostic classifiers to increase patient safety (1.5%). Some of the machine learning methods identified were the use of a natural language processing system to detect potential adverse events and the creation of a model based off laboratory tests to detect patients that may have had an adverse drug event linked to a drug-drug interaction. Conclusions: The most frequent use of machine learning in patient safety is to gather information on adverse drug reactions or adverse drug events. The natural language processing systems and models for adverse drug events were able to capture adverse events or drug-drug interactions earlier than traditional methods.

The current epidemic of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines contributes to vaccine hesitancy with lethal consequences. Antipathy to immunizations, frequently associated with myths, has a long history and has repeatedly allowed vaccine preventable diseases to resurge. Pharmacoepidemiologic studies to assess new vaccine safety concerns can be time consuming and expensive. An association in cats between vaccination sites and sarcomata has been recognized for 30 years. Cases are rare but led to recommendations for immunizations at distal locations to allow resection by amputation.

2488,"Methods: Anticipating that feline experience might give rise to concern over possible human implications, we examined US data from large cancer registries to look for ecologic associations between typical vaccine injection sites and connective tissue malignancies (excluding Kaposi's sarcoma) between 1975 and 2018, as several new vaccines were introduced. Modeling employed SEER 9 and SEER 18 registry data covering up to 30% of the US population. We defined fibrosarcoma histology by morphology codes and potential vaccine injection sites by primary tumor locations. Regression analyzes employed JoinPoint software (IMS, Calverton, Maryland) to estimate average annual percentage changes in rates, change points, and the percentage change in incidence rates by year. Results: The best fitting models from SEER 18 data have a larger decrease in fibrosarcoma incidence rates at possible vaccination sites from 2000 to 2018, with an annual percentage change (APC) of À4.5% compared to an APC of À3.3% for other locations (both significant with p < 0.001). This pattern is inconsistent with any association of these tumors with vaccinations over an extended period as vaccine coverage grew for protection against increasing numbers of target diseases. Our negative result is biologically plausible, based on established limitations in extrapolating from animals to humans along with specific demonstrations of fibrosarcomata at injection sites only in cats and ferrets.

Social health determinants including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) have been associated with individual risk for health disparities and adverse health outcomes. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication of pregnancy and decisions to initiate pharmacotherapy may be influenced by social or community factors that impact lifestyle and healthcare utilization. However, few studies have evaluated the role of social vulnerability in GDM management. Objectives: To examine the association between SVI and GDM pharmacotherapy initiation. Methods: We identified a retrospective cohort of pregnant women with GDM enrolled in Tennessee Medicaid who delivered between 2007-2019 using claims and pharmacy data linked to vital records and a state hospitalization registry.

Objectives: To investigate the relationship between being pregnant with a female fetus and the severity of NVP. Methods: In a cohort study, we linked data from nationwide registers on pregnancies, prescriptions, and primary and secondary healthcare from 2004 to 2020 in Norway. Singleton pregnancies with recorded information on sex and resulting in termination, stillbirth or live birth were included. NVP was identified from a diagnosis or the dispensing of antiemetic drugs in first trimester, when its symptoms usually are most severe. Severity of NVP was classified in two ways. First, by the level of care at which the diagnosis for NVP was recorded: 1) primary care, 2) outpatient secondary care and 3) inpatient secondary care. Second, according to the recommended treatment pyramid for the dispensing of antiemetic drugs in pregnancy: 1) antihistamines, 2) dopamine antagonists, 3) ondansetron and 4) methylprednisolone. Using Poisson regression, we estimated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for a diagnosis at each level of healthcare and the dispensing of a drug from each level of the antiemetic drug treatment pyramid for women pregnant with a female compared to a male fetus. No adjustments were made. Results: We included 961 790 pregnancies, 48.6% with females and 51.4% with males.

To retrieve coded diagnoses, codes were mapped from the Matcho algorithm and other sources to many vocabularies (ICD9CM, ICD10CM, ICPC) via the Codemapper tool. Records of the same person were listed longitudinally, and grouped in episodes of pregnancy. Using hierarchical rules we defined start date, end date (limited to pregnancies completed by the time of data extraction) and type of end, categorized as livebirth, still birth, termination, spontaneous abortion, ectopic, unknown (UKN), ongoing (ONG). Results: Episodes of pregnancy were 566 050, 126 119, 1 954 078, 7039 108 566, 885 415 in ARS, CASERTA, BIFAP, VID, PHARMO, UOSL, respectively. BR was the highest provenance in the hierarchy in 100% of cases in UOSL, and ranged from 95.1% in ARS to none in BIFAP. All data sources except UOSL could retrieve pregnancies whose end was UKN: these constituted 13.2%, 4.5%, 35.2%, 24.4%, and 1.0% of pregnancies identified in ARS, CASERTA, BIFAP, VID and PHARMO, respectively. ONG pregnancies could be retrieved from ARS, BIFAP, VID and PHARMO. Conclusions: The algorithm leveraged heterogeneous provenances in Europe. Pregnancies could be retrieved that would have gone unnoticed if querying only information recorded at the end of pregnancy, including pregnancies that were ONG at the time of data extraction. Detecting ONG and UKN pregnancies can substantially increase cohorts, with potential to extensively assess impact of regulatory decisions, and to rapidly investigate emerging issues, such as drug utilization in pregnancies exposed to COVID, or exposure and safety of COVID vaccines during pregnancy.

Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate completeness of recording of chronic diseases and adverse maternal obstetric outcomes during hospitalizations for a delivery in the Swiss Hospital Medical Statistics (MS) dataset. Methods: We conducted a nationwide observational cross-sectional study (2012-2018) based on the Swiss MS dataset. We identified hospitalizations of women who delivered a singleton live-born infant (ICD-10-GM) in an inpatient setting in Switzerland and quantified the prevalence of 23 chronic diseases (ICD-10-GM). We compared our results to a nationwide Danish registry study, which used the same disease definition to quantify disease prevalence during pregnancy. We further quantified the prevalence of adverse maternal obstetric outcomes (ICD-10-GM and CHOP) during the delivery hospitalization and compared our results to existing literature. Results: We identified 577'220 delivery hospitalizations, of which 4.99% had a record for a least one diagnosis for a chronic disease (versus 15.49% in Denmark). In total, 13 of 23 chronic diseases were substantially under-recorded, and eight of those diseases were more than 10-fold more frequent in the Danish study than in ours, including psychiatric diagnoses, chronic lung disease (including asthma), rheumatoid arthritis, ischemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Thyroid disorders (2.65% vs 2.29%), non-ischemic cardiovascular disease (0.17% vs 0.14%), and coagulation disorders (1.07% vs 0.73%) were recorded similarly often. The prevalence of adverse maternal obstetric outcomes was comparable to other European countries (gestational diabetes: 6.85%, gestational hypertension: 1.02%, pre-eclampsia/HELLP-syndrome: 1.79%, postpartum hemorrhage: 7.95%, placental abruption: 0.60%, and preterm delivery: 4.11%). Conclusions: Our results suggest that chronic diseases are underrecorded during delivery hospitalizations in the MS dataset, which may be due to specific coding guidelines and aspects of whether or not a disease generates billable effort to a hospital. Adverse maternal obstetric outcomes are more completely captured, but future studies need to confirm their true prevalence.",1.0,disease,True

2560,"Background: Depressive disorders are relatively common during pregnancy and mainly treated with antidepressants inhibiting serotonin (SSRI) or serotonin and noradrenaline- (SNRI) recapture. In the general population, the use of such antidepressants has been associated with pressor effects. Gestational hypertension (GHTA), a new onset of arterial hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation is a leading cause of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible association between exposure to SNRI during pregnancy and GHTA. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible association between exposure to SNRI during pregnancy and GHTA. Methods: EFEMERIS database was used; it contains medications dispensed to pregnant women in Haute-Garonne between July 2004 and December 2019. We identified women with GHTA using antihypertensive medication after 20 weeks of gestation, hospitalization for GHTA, mention of GHTA on children compulsory health certificates or on pregnancy termination records. We compared women exposed to SNRIs to women using SSRIs and to unexposed controls. Univariate then multivariate logistic regressions have been conducted. Results: The study included 308 pregnancies (0.2%) exposed to SNRIs, 1627 (1.1%) to SSRIs and 144 580 (98.7%) unexposed pregnant women. Women exposed to SNRI or SSRI had more long-term health conditions (12.5% and 11.3% versus 2.1%), had been more exposed to potentially hypertensive medications during pregnancy (19.5% and 20.7% versus 12.7%) and have been prescribed a higher average number of active substances than those not exposed (13.9 versus 8.9). The rate of women with GHTA was higher among women exposed to SNRIs (9.1%) compared to women exposed to SSRIs (5.4%) (ORa , 1.82[1.16-2.87]) and those not exposed (4.3%) (ORa ,"" 2.21[1.48-3.29]). Conclusions: This study indicates an increased risk of GHTA in women treated with SNRI. The observed effect needs to be further investigated.

We identified pregnancies in women aged 20 to 44 who gave live births between June 1, 2011, and December 31, 2019. Exposure was defined as 1 prescription for PPIs during the first trimester, which was further categorized by cumulative defined daily dose (DDD) for subgroup analyzes. The unexposed reference group was defined as no filled prescription for PPIs from 90 days before the start of pregnancy to the end of the first trimester. Outcomes of interest were overall malformations, cardiac malformations, cleft palate, hypospadias, and hydrocephalus, selected on the basis of previous findings that suggested potential increased risks associated with PPI use. The diagnoses of malformation were identified using infants' records within 1 year after birth. We used propensity score (PS) fine stratification to control for 31 potential confounders and a weighted generalized linear model to estimate relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: The study cohort of 2 696 216 pregnancies included 40 540 (1.5%) pregnancies exposed to PPIs during the first trimester. The absolute risk of overall malformations among PPI-exposed and unexposed pregnancies was 49.7 and 39.7 per 1000 pregnancies, respectively. After the PS adjustment, the RR was slightly increased for overall malformations (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.13) and cardiac malformations (1.08, 1.01-1.15), but did not reach statistical significance for the cleft palate (1.02, 0.73-1.43), hypospadias (0.70, 0.46-1.07), and hydrocephalus (1.05, 0.59-1.86).

2574,"Background: Asthma is a common chronic condition affecting also pregnant women. It is recommended to continue the use of long-term asthma control medications during pregnancy to improve the health of mothers and the newborns. However, in Belgium there is little information about the utilization and the evolution of long-term asthma control medication during pregnancy. Objectives: To investigate the trends in the use of long-term asthma control medications during pregnancy between 2003 and 2018 in Belgium. Methods: We used a nationally representative database of health insurance claims, as the permanent sample. We calculated the proportion of pregnant women who filled at least one prescription of long-acting 32-agonists (ATC code R03AC12-13), inhaled corticosteroids (ATC code R03BA), combination of inhaled 32-agonists and corticosteroids (ATC code R03AK), theophylline (ATC code R03DA) and leukotriene modifiers (ATC code R03DC). The proportions were calculated for successive 2 years periods between 2003 and 2018. Logistic regressions were used to analyze the trends of the prescriptions dispensed during pregnancy while controlling for maternal age. Results: The study included 42 582 pregnancies. Overall, we observed a significant increasing trend in the prescriptions of the asthmacontrol medications dispensed during pregnancy from 3% (95% CI, 2.5-3.5%) in 2003-2004 to 4.2 % (95% CI, 3.8-5%) in 2017-2018 ptrend <0.001.

For the long-acting 32-agonists alone and theophylline, the number of pregnancies exposed was less than 5. Conclusions: Using a national database, we showed for the first time that the proportion of the pregnant women with at least one prescription of long-term asthma control medications is increasing in Belgium. The two most used medications dispensed during pregnancy were combinations of 32-agonists with inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled corticosteroids alone. The study also highlights an increase trend in the use of combination fixed-dose inhalers. While our results suggest an increasing use of asthma medication during pregnancy, future research should explore the adherence of the treatment before and during pregnancy.""",0.0,,False

Objectives: To compare maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant individuals treated for opioid use disorder with buprenorphine or methadone during pregnancy. Methods: We conducted a cohort study in publicly insured pregnant individuals in the Medicaid Analytic eXtract from 2000-2014 comparing buprenorphine and methadone. Exposure during early pregnancy (through week 19), late pregnancy (week 20 through delivery), and in the 30 days prior to delivery was assessed using dispensing and administration codes. Outcomes included neonatal abstinence syndrome, preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age, cesarean delivery, and severe maternal morbidity. We estimated risk ratios (RR) and adjusted for a wide range of confounders using propensity score overlap weights, including demographics, markers for opioid use disorder history and severity, chronic conditions, concomitant medication use, and healthcare utilization. Results: In early pregnancy, 4349 and 1927 pregnancies were exposed to buprenorphine and methadone, respectively. 4331 and 2287 were exposed to buprenorphine and methadone in late pregnancy (with 3758 and 2070 in the 30 days prior to delivery).

Yet, it can be a challenge for voluntary, observational studies like pregnancy registries to ensure the study population is representative in terms of potential biological, social, and other determinants of health. Understanding the demographic characteristics of pregnancy registry participants is important for assessing representativeness and putting results into context. Objectives: To examine the demographic characteristics of pregnancy registry participants in the published literature in comparison with those of pregnant women in the general US population. Methods: We searched PubMed (term ""pregnancy registry"") and the websites of OTIS, VAMPSS, and Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) to identify English language publications from pregnancy registries conducted primarily in the US and Europe. The most recent publication from each registry that reported the impact of drug exposures on pregnancy outcomes was included.

2602,"Background: Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. Calcium-based antacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used during pregnancy to treat symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Both have been hypothesized to reduce the risk of preeclampsia. Objectives: To determine the associations of calcium-based antacid and PPI use during pregnancy with late-onset preeclampsia, taking into account dosage and timing of use. Methods: We included 9058 pregnant women participating in the PRIDE Study (2012-2019) or pREGnant (2014-2019), two prospective cohorts in The Netherlands. Data were collected through webbased questionnaires and obstetric records. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) for late-onset preeclampsia for any use and trajectories of calcium-based antacid and PPI use before gestational day 238, as well as hazard ratios for time-varying exposures after gestational day 237. The models were weighted using inverse probability of censoring weights and adjusted for a sufficient set of confounders. Results: Late-onset preeclampsia was diagnosed in 2.6% of pregnancies. Any use of calcium-based antacids (RR 1.2 [95% CI 0.9-1.6]) or PPIs (RR 1.4 [95% CI 0.8-2.4]) before gestational day 238 was not associated with late-onset preeclampsia. However, use of low-dose calcium-based antacids in gestational weeks 0-16 (<1 g/day; RR 1.8 [95% CI 1.1-2.9]) and any use of PPIs in gestational weeks 17-33 (RR 1.6 [95% CI 1.0- 2.8]) seemed to increase the risk of late-onset preeclampsia. We did not observe any associations between late-onset preeclampsia and use of calcium-based antacids and PPIs after gestational day 237. Conclusions: In this prospective cohort study, use of calcium-based antacids and PPIs during pregnancy was not found to reduce the risk of late-onset preeclampsia.",1.0,flu,True

Furthermore, we conducted a cohort analysis to determine the number of pregnancies between 2004 and 2016 occurring during isotretinoin therapy. For that purpose, we assigned an exposure window to each dispensation (date of dispensation + number of dispensed defined daily doses) and assessed whether it overlapped with the onset of pregnancy. The study was financed by Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM). Results: We identified 39 627 girls/women with at least one dispensation of isotretinoin. Age-standardized prevalence of girls/women with 1 dispensation of isotretinoin per 1000 persons increased from 1.19 in 2004 to 1.87 in 2016 (57% increase). About 60% of isotretinoin users were in age group 16-30 years. In total, there were 249 624 dispensations of isotretinoin during the study period. Of these, 88.7% were prescribed by dermatologists and 5.9% by general practitioners. Overall, we identified 45 pregnancies exposed to isotretinoin at the onset of pregnancy. The number doubled when the month before pregnancy was also considered as relevant exposure. Conclusions: Use of isotretinoin among women of childbearing age has increased in Germany between 2004 and 2016. The majority of users were in age groups with a high prevalence of child birth.

Objectives: To describe the most common clinical diagnoses in a cohort of commercially insured pregnant women and how they vary by trimester. Methods: Using the Optum Dynamic Assessment of Pregnancies and Infants (DAPI) database, pregnancies were identified in medical claims data from October 2015 through October 2021. Date of last menstrual period (LMP) was estimated in two ways. For pregnancies in which at least one Z3A code was observed (83.0%), LMP was estimated by subtracting the weeks of gestation specified by the code from the service date for all Z3A codes within the pregnancy episode and taking the median date. For pregnancies without Z3A codes, we estimated the LMP by subtracting a fixed number of weeks from the pregnancy outcome date; for example, for singleton full term deliveries, 39 weeks were subtracted. We identified trimesters using the following definitions: first trimester, LMP through 13 weeks; second trimester, 14 through 27 weeks; third trimester, 28 weeks through end of pregnancy.

The risk of MCM was 4.7% in pregnancies with no pregestational diabetes, 7.7% in those exposed to insulin, and 7.6% in those exposed to a non-insulin second line ADM.

Results were similar in both cohorts. Conclusions: Preliminary results show a higher prevalence of MCM in pregnancies exposed to non-insulin second line ADM compared to pregnancies with no pregestational diabetes. However, the PR moves to the null when using a comparison group with the same underlying indication and on the recommended T2DM treatment in pregnancy.

Methods: Using Optum's Dynamic Assessment of Pregnancies and Infants (DAPI), an existing mother-infant linked claims database, pregnancies among women aged 18-55 years and their linked infants were identified. Pregnancies were linked to potential male parents, defined as individuals with the same family member identifier at any time between the start of pregnancy (estimated date of last menstrual period [LMP]) and the pregnancy end date, including an additional timeframe of 30 days before and after. Linked male parents were required to be 1855 years on the LMP date. To reduce the potential for linkage to a non-parent male family member (e.g. father or brother of the pregnant female), we restricted to the subset of pregnancies linked to one male only, pregnancies with mother's age greater than 26, and pregnancies where the mother's age was within 10 years of the linked male's age. We chose a minimum maternal age of 26 to account for the potential for younger mothers to be included under their parent's health plan. Results: A total of 1 192 044 pregnancies occurring between October 2015 and August 2021 were identified as the source within which to link to potential male parents. The mean maternal age was 31 years. There were 725 048 pregnancies (61%) with linkage to one or more",1.0,negative,True

2653,"Optum Epidemiology Background: Preterm birth (i.e., birth of an infant before 37 weeks gestation) is an outcome of interest when evaluating medication safety during pregnancy. Preterm birth can be identified in health insurance claims databases using International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes, which include obstetric (i.e., O) codes for preterm delivery for use on maternal claims and perinatal period (i.e., P) codes for extreme immaturity/preterm newborn for use on infant claims. Additionally, it is possible to calculate gestational age to identify deliveries that occur prior to 37 weeks gestation, independent of codes for preterm birth. Objectives: To determine the correspondence between 3 separate methods to identify preterm birth: 1) diagnosis code on a maternal claim; 2) diagnosis code on an infant claim; 3) gestational age <37 weeks at delivery. Methods: Using Optum's Dynamic Assessment of Pregnancies and Infants (DAPI), a claims-based pregnancy database that includes mother-infant linkages, women with pregnancies between October 2015 and August 2021 that were linked to infants were identified. A diagnosis of preterm birth was identified based on the presence of ICD-10 codes O60.1, P07.2, or P07.3 on a maternal or infant claim. Gestational age was calculated using the last menstrual period (LMP) as estimated by ICD-10 Z3A codes denoting weeks of gestation and delivery date.

Whether well-child care (WCC) visits vary by type of POE and important social determinants of health is unknown. Methods: In this population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada, children with POE were classified as 1) <30 days prescribed opioid analgesia, 2) 30+ days prescribed opioid analgesia, 3) medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD [buprenorphine, methadone, or other opioid agonist]), 4) combined MOUD and opioid analgesia, or 5) unregulated opioid use. Study outcomes included attending 5 WCC visits by age 2 years, and the 18-month enhanced well-child visit (EWCV). Modified Poisson regression was used to examine factors associated with outcomes. Results: Children with prenatal exposure to <30 days of opioid analgesics were most likely to attend 5 WCC visits (61.2%).

Healthcare utilization databases are increasingly used in perinatal pharmacoepidemiology. However, the validity of studying LBW based on recorded diagnosis is not well documented. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) LBW codes recorded in healthcare claims. Methods: We identified a nationwide sample of 462 infants born 2009-2014 in the Medicaid Analytic eXtract, who had Medicaid coverage at birth. Infants were sampled stratified by preterm status (N ,"" 201 preterm, N "","" 261 term). Medical delivery hospitalization records were retrieved, and birth weight as documented in these records was considered the gold standard. LBW was determined present in the claims if there was 1 ICD-9 code with a specified weight range <2500 grams (765.01-08, 765.11-18, V21.31-35) within 30 days after birth. Performance characteristics - sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) - of LBW codes against LBW classification based on weight documented in the medical records were calculated. Results were stratified by preterm status, and consistency between claimsbased weight range and true weight was assessed. Results: Among 201 infants born preterm were 100 with 1 LBW code (95 true positives) and 101 with no such code (82 true negatives), leading to a Se of 83.3%, Sp of 94.3%, PPV of 95.0% and NPV of 81.2%. Among 261 infants born at term, 11 had 1 code (10 true positives) and 250 had no LBW code (239 true negatives), resulting in a Se of 47.6%, Sp of 99.6%, PPV of 90.6% and NPV of 95.6%. Estimates overall, accounting for the stratified sampling, were 65.7%, 99.2%, 93.5% and 94.6% respectively. When looking at the actual weight, there was very good correspondence between weight range recorded in claims and weight documented in medical records, with 103 of all 105 true positives having claims-based weight ranges including the true weight.

2672,"Background: There have been few published studies on the prevalence of medications used by lactating persons and they have been limited by small size, selection bias, and lack of information on infant age. Objectives: Using a novel, electronic health record (EHR)-based approach, to estimate the prevalence of medication use at 2, 4, and 6 months postpartum among lactating mothers. Methods: We utilized automated EHR data from a US health system to conduct a retrospective cohort study. To classify lactation status among postpartum persons, we used infant feeding information (breast milk only, formula or other milk only, or both) at well-child visits (WCV) and maternal breastfeeding status at postpartum visits (yes, no). This information is routinely recorded in standardized fields in the health system's EHR. To identify maternal medication use, we used dispensing data from pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacies via Surescripts® health information network. We linked mothers receiving prenatal care within the health system to their infants born between May 2018 and June 2019 and required infants to have at least one WCV between 31-90 days of life (i.e., 2-month WCV). We included mothers of infants who received breastmilk at 2-month WCVs and excluded mothers reporting no breastfeeding at postpartum visits. Mothers were excluded when infants were not receiving breastmilk at WCVs. We assessed maternal medications dispensed between 17-90, 77-150, and 137-210 days after delivery corresponding to 2, 4, and 6-month WCV less a two-week grace period (to allow for continued use of medications dispensed just before the WCV). Results: We identified 6049 eligible mothers, and 4181 (69.1%) were classified as lactating at the 2-month WCV. Among the lactating mothers, 62.7% were Non-Hispanic White and 31.4% had public insurance. The most common medication classes dispensed between 17-90 days postpartum were oral progestin contraceptives (19.3%), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (9.1%), first generation cephalosporins (4.3%), thyroid hormones (3.6%), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (3.4%), penicillinase-resistant penicillins (3.1%), topical corticosteroids (2.9%), and imidazole-related antifungals (2.1%).

Methods: Using the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD, claims data from ~20% of the German population) we selected a cohort of girls/women aged 12-50 years initiating RVX treatment between December 2011 and December 2016 and followed the cohort until end of 2018. Based on established algorithms, we identified pregnancies occurring during follow-up and linked the mothers' and the babies' data. We classified a pregnancy as exposed during the critical time window for malformations if there was (i) a RVX dispensing during day 1-56 or (ii) a supply overlapping it with a follow-up dispensing within 30 days. Comprehensive patient profiles of pregnant women and their linked live-born children were reviewed to describe pregnancy outcomes. Results: The cohort included 14 953 women in whom 778 pregnancies were identified during follow-up. In 133 pregnancies, there was a dispensing of RVX in the 90 days before onset (group 1), in 48 during first trimester (group 2), in 2 during second trimester, and in 1 during third trimester. In 630 pregnancies, there was no RVX dispensing in these time windows (group 3). In group 1, 2, and 3, respectively, the proportion ending in a live birth was 83%, 75%, and 91%.

2682,"Background: Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are often used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatic diseases. These conditions also occur in women of childbearing age. Therefore, pregnant women may also be exposed. It is still a matter of debate whether the immunosuppressive effects of TNFi increase the risk of severe infections in infants, particularly when they were exposed during the second half of pregnancy. Objectives: Based on German claims data, we aimed to describe i) the dispensation of TNFi before and during pregnancy and ii) the occurrence of infections leading to hospitalization in the first year of life among prenatally exposed infants. Methods: Using the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD), we included live-born children from pregnancies starting between 2006 and 2016 in women aged 12-50 years, and with at least one dispensation of TNFi in the 180 days before or during pregnancy (continuous health insurance in this period was required). We described patterns of exposure among included pregnancies. Furthermore, we assessed hospitalization of infants due to severe infections (main discharge diagnosis) in their first year of life.

Little is known about how mothers with and without linked infants may differ, informing analyzes and interpretation. Not all infant outcomes can be assessed on maternal records, as not all are evident at birth. Thus, there is a need to assess some outcomes using infants' health claims. October 2018, Mother-Infant Linkage (MIL) table was added to the Sentinel Common Data Model (SCDM); HealthCore implemented the use of the MIL table into the HealthCore Integrated Research DatabaseSM (HIRD) in March 2020 Objectives: To examine the characteristics, including demographics, for women with linked infants and women without linked infants in the HIRD Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a large existing cohort of all live births in the HIRD, March 2020 and March 2021, ages 18- 49 years at delivery with a minimum of 6-months of continuous enrollment. For the MIL in the HIRD, deterministic matching on subscriber ID was applied to link mothers with delivery claims to their infant(s). A mother was classified as linked to her infant if infant's date of birth was within three days of the delivery date. We examined the distributions of maternal demographic characteristics stratified by infant-linkage status. For continuous measures, mean and standard deviation (SD) were calculated, and proportions for categorical measures Results: As of March 2021, the HIRD has 1.9 million mothers and 3.4 million infants, resulting in 1.4 million mother-infant linkages (73.4%). For this analysis, 101 580 women with live birth claims were identified in the HIRD between March 2020 and March 2021. Of these, 64 400 (63.3%) had linked infants and 37 180 (36.6%) had no linked infant.

Objectives: To utilize data from a large health insurance claims database to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on obstetric and gynecologic healthcare utilization and outcomes. Methods: For each month of 2019 and 2020, women aged 18- 45 years on the first of the month without prior claims for hysterectomy, sterilization, or menopause and who were enrolled for the entire month were identified in the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD). For each month, we calculated the proportion of women with a claim for each of the following encounter types: gynecologic exams, prenatal visits, pregnancy-related encounters, preterm births, and preeclampsia, eclampsia, or gestational hypertension (PEGH). For each month, we calculated the deviation from the expected 2020 counts by subtracting the 2020 proportion from the 2019 proportion and multiplying the difference by the 2020 denominator for that month Results: For each month, at least 2.8 million qualifying women were identified. Throughout 2019, approximately 3% of women generated a claim for a gynecologic exam each month. In 2020, this number dropped to 0.5%-1.9% in March-May, with a total of 133 406 potentially missed or delayed gynecologic exams in 2020.

Methods: We used the IBM® MarketScan® Research Database from Oct 2015 to Feb 2020 to identify patients with livebirth delivery and exposure to study drugs. We excluded patients diagnosed with preterm premature rupture of membranes, exposed to other antibiotic types and routes or teratogenic drugs. We modeled a PS based on infection indications a week prior to and including index, gestational age at index, and covariates developed for pregnant populations.

We also noted alerts indicating infection complications, which were unlikely safety issues, suggesting that indication-related outcomes could be removed from the outcome tree to reduce noise. Conclusions: Signal identification assessments designed to screen thousands of outcomes are unlikely to achieve optimal confounding control. Increased efforts are needed to reduce bias due to unmeasured confounding, especially given different confounders could be associated with different outcomes. Additionally, the outcome tree may need to be tailored to eliminate issues of protopathic bias though retention of complications that imply ineffective treatment may be desirable. Screening analyzes should anticipate and minimize noise but should also tolerate potential false alerts to facilitate full capture of safety issues when prioritizing outcomes for targeted pharmacoepidemiology studies.",1.0,epidemiology,True

2704,"Background: When data sources do not have clinical or obstetric estimates for gestational age at birth (GAB) or ICD-10-CM Z3A codes for gestational age, researchers often use a fixed duration of pregnancy based on published mode or median GABs, such as 39 weeks (w) for all live births. GAB estimates for subgroups of live births can be derived using the CDC´s US birth data files, which report clinically based GAB and many data elements from birth certificates. Objectives: To describe the distribution of GAB stratified by plurality (e.g., twin) and within plurality by other relevant subgroups. Methods: We used CDC´s US birth data for 2019 (the most recent pre-pandemic year) and 2020 (the most recent available year). The study population included all live births with nonmissing GAB. We stratified data based on plurality and other variables. For each stratum, we estimated mean, standard deviation, median, mode, and percentage born at each gestational week. We present results overall and for singletons and twins for 2020. Results for 2019 were similar. Results: In 2020, 3 619 826 newborns were issued birth certificates; 3 617 213 (99.9%) had nonmissing GAB. Among singletons (3 501 693; 96.8%), the median and mode GAB were 39 w overall and in most strata. Births with smaller median or mode GAB were from women with eclampsia (0.3% of 3 617 213 live births; median and mode, 37 w), women receiving intensive care (0.2%; median, 37; mode, 39 w), newborns receiving intensive care (8.0%; median, 37; mode, 39 w), low birth weight (LBW, 6.5%; median, 35; mode, 37 w), very LBW (1.0%; median and mode, 28 w), extremely LBW (0.5%; median and mode, 25 w), and newborns not discharged alive (0.2%; median, 23; mode, 22 w).

2708,"Background: Three-quarters of pregnant people have nausea or vomiting; many use antiemetic medications to manage these symptoms. Evidence from small trials suggests that the antiemetic ondansetron may provide effective symptom relief while being better tolerated than other antiemetics. However, evidence from some observational studies suggests ondansetron may be associated with malformations, leading to a 2019 warning against first trimester use by the European Medicines Agency. A US study reported prenatal ondansetron use increasing dramatically from 2006-2014, but no studies have examined whether this increase has continued. Objectives: To describe recent trends in prenatal ondansetron use, as well as any prenatal antiemetic use, in a US integrated health system, particularly after 2014. Methods: We used electronic health record data from Kaiser Permanente Washington to study pregnancies in women age 15-49 from 2010-2021. We assessed prescription antiemetic exposure using outpatient pharmacy dispensings. For each year, we calculated the proportion of pregnancies exposed to 1 dispensing of ondansetron, promethazine, metoclopramide, doxylamine with pyridoxine (combination medication), pyridoxine, or prochlorperazine, and constructed 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Objectives: To determine the incidence rate of hospitalization and severe maternal and perinatal outcomes and to investigate medication use among pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 across multiple European countries. Methods: This is a multi-national population-based cohort study using the International Network of Obstetric Survey Systems (INOSS). Countries participating in this network adapted their surveillance system during the COVID-19 pandemic to monitor pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study population comprised all pregnant women admitted to hospital with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test within 7 days prior to or during admission and up to 2 days after giving birth between February/March and December 31, 2020. Pregnant women were eligible for inclusion if they were admitted due to COVID-19 or were symptomatic. Common protocols with uniform definitions were used in each country to retrieve information from hospital records, including medicine use, maternal and perinatal outcomes. Results: In the source population of 1 898 811 maternities, 2 347 women were admitted due to COVID-19. The rate of hospitalization due to COVID-19 ranged from 0.2 to 1.9 per 1000 maternities across countries, 308 (13%) women were admitted to ICU, and 147 (6%) needed mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Conclusions: This multi-national collaborative approach allows comparison of the impact of varying timing and nature of public health measures implemented by different nations. We observed that the rate of hospitalization due to COVID-19 and medication use among pregnant women varied across different European countries in 2020. Admission due to COVID-19 was associated with a high risk of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, preterm delivery and ceaserean section. It is striking that only a few pregnant women received medical treatment directed at COVID-19.

Methods: Using the Optum Dynamic Assessment of Pregnancies and Infants (DAPI) database, pregnancies that started and ended between 01 April 2020 and 31 October 2021 were identified. COVID status was determined by ICD-10 codes and SARS-CoV-2 viral test results (identified using LOINC codes and test descriptions). Pregnancies with at least one positive test or ICD-10 code U07.1 or U07.2 were confirmed positive (CP). The remaining tested pregnancies were categorized as negative (CN) if at least one negative test was recorded or uncertain (CU) if no clear result was observed during pregnancy.

Corticosteroids, azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine, ciclosporine and tacrolimus are considered safe treatments during pregnancy. However, these treatment options may still not be sufficient in patients poorly responsive to conventional therapies or patients who suffer from nephritis. The only biologic authorized for SLE up to this date, belimumab, is currently not recommended for use during pregnancy due to lack of data. Pregnant patients, face the dilemma of cessation or continuation of belimumab. If belimumab is stopped there will be a risk of SLE flare and its consequences for mother and foetus. Continuation is also not optimal because the lack of knowledge. Objectives: To compare the reported fetal outcomes in SLE patients who stopped scheduled belimumab within the first trimester (group A) and who continued scheduled belimumab during the first trimester or thereafter (group B).

In covariate-adjusted models in the 2019 cohort, the incidence of SMM was higher among CS than vaginal deliveries at both 42 days (5.6% vs 2.4%; OR 2.02, 95% CI: 1.93, 2.13) and 360 days (6.5% vs 3.0%; OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.78, 1.95). Remaining outcomes were similarly more common among CS deliveries at both time points, except for hemorrhage. Risk of 1-year infant morbidity in the 2019 cohort was higher among CS vs vaginal deliveries (27.7% vs. 23.6%; OR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.17-1.22). Incidence of morbidity was higher in CS vs vaginal delivers for both full-term (27.7% vs. 23.6%) and preterm infants (56.7% vs 41.8%). Similar trends were observed in the 2020 cohorts. Conclusions: Our study, performed using recent data obtained from a large US healthcare claims database, provides contemporary evidence of potential risks to mothers and infants of CS delivery relative to vaginal delivery.",1.0,flu,True

2804,"Background: Maternal use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is common, estimated at 8% in the US. Although the risks to infants from antennal exposure appear to be small, clear quantitative data is missing. Studies have found that higher risk of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was associated with maternal exposure to antidepressants during and prior-to pregnancy, as well as with paternal exposure, indicating that there may be residual confounding factors. Objectives: We aimed to estimate the effects of SSRIs and maternal depression on the child's risk of ASD and ADHD, using data from electronic health records. Methods: We used primary care electronic health records of mothers and their children from IMRD-UK (incorporating data from THIN, a Cegedim database). The cohort included 141 974 children of 115 453 mothers, born between 2000-2018. We applied large-scale propensity score matching that included all demographic and clinical covariates (conditions, drugs, observations and procedures) and estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of ASD and ADHD diagnosed at ages 3-10 years using Cox proportional hazards model. We compared the following groups: (1) mothers with history of depression that were either exposed to SSRIs or unexposed to any antidepressant during pregnancy; (2) mothers that used SSRIs before conception and were either exposed or unexposed during pregnancy; (3) mothers unexposed during pregnancy with or without history of depression. To adjust for unmeasured confounding bias, we applied empirical calibration using unrelated health outcomes as negative controls and synthetic positive controls.

The HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD) contains claims from approximately 1 in 10 US pregnancies during the pandemic, presenting a unique opportunity to study the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy. Objectives: To utilize data from a large health insurance claims database to investigate the effect of COVID-19 infection on pregnancyrelated outcomes. Methods: We included women with an ICD-10-CM or ICD-10-PCS code for a pregnancy outcome during the study period (Jan 2020 - Mar 2021), with 6 months of continuous enrollment in the HIRD prior to their estimated last menstrual period (LMP) date, and aged 1849 years at LMP. We restricted women to their first pregnancy. Maternal COVID-19 status was determined using ICD-10-CM U07.1 for lab-confirmed COVID-19 or a positive antigen or RNA test any time during or 30 days prior to LMP. We calculated the prevalences of preterm birth, stillbirth, small for gestational age (SGA), low birth weight (LBW), pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, gestational hypertension, cesarian delivery, and major congenital malformations (MCM) among COVID-19 infected and non-COVID-19 infected pregnancies. We calculated unadjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each outcome, comparing COVID-19 infected to uninfected pregnancies. Results: We identified 188 072 qualifying pregnancies during the study period. Of these, 8920 (5%) were exposed to documented maternal COVID-19 infection. We observed higher prevalences for all examined birth outcomes among COVID-19 pregnancies as compared to non-COVID pregnancies, with PRs ranging from 1.10 to 1.99: stillbirth: 1.10 (95% CI: 0.911.34); preterm birth: 1.24 (95% CI 1.14-",1.0,COVID-19,True

Objective: To examine change in the utilization of biologics 6 months before, during and after pregnancy among patients with autoimmune conditions. Methods: We used US national IBM® MarketScan® Research Databases and identified all pregnancy episodes regardless of outcome with an estimated conception date between 2012 and 2018 among persons age 12 to 55 years. Patients had continuous insurance benefits from 6 months before to 6 months after pregnancy end date and had a condition where a biologic may be used. These conditions include multiple sclerosis (MS), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). An autoimmune disease (AID) was identified by a related diagnosis in  1 inpatient or  2 outpatient encounters on different dates during the 6 months before conception. Utilization of biologics was determined by pharmacy dispensing claims and healthcare common procedure coding system codes on medical encounters. Results: We identified 11 631 pregnancy episodes with an autoimmune condition.

Objectives: We hypothesized that the rate of incident sarcoidosis in patients after solid organ transplantation would be lower in patients treated with mTOR inhibitors compared with calcineurin inhibitor users. Methods: We used the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) covering all Danish hospitals to identify patients with solid organ transplants between 1996-2018. Patients receiving mTOR inhibitor or calcineurin inhibitor treatment after the transplantation were included in the study. The DNPR and the Danish National Prescription Registry were used to identify treatment with mTOR inhibitors and calcineurin inhibitors. Patients with sarcoidosis outcome were identified from the DNPR based on the International Classification of Diseases-10 code D86. Patients entered the cohort 90 days after the date of transplant and were followed until sarcoidosis diagnosis, date of death or 12.31.2018 --whichever came first.

Methods: Searches were performed in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Trip medical database and CRD databases up to October 2021. Primary research studies published in English, which reported burden of disease for patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems in AADC deficiency were included. Two independent reviewers carried out screening and data extraction. Results: The search yielded 968 identical records, of which 54 have been included after review. Forty-eight studies reported signs/ symptoms of patients with AADC deficiency, one reported impact of disease on patients, three described the impact of disease on caregivers, and two reported the disease impact on healthcare systems. Patients with AADC deficiency experienced a wide range of signs/ symptoms (i.e. developmental delay, movement disorders, autonomic dysfunction, etc.) regardless of motor milestone achieved. These symptoms and limited function had a negative impact on patients' ability to develop, socialize due to significant impact on activities of daily living and on their emotional wellbeing.

Objectives: The study sought to estimate the nationwide epidemiologyof PPP in China and conduct a systematic review of the published data worldwide. Methods: A population-based study was conducted using Urban Basic Medical Insurance in China from 2012 to 2016. International Classification of Diseases code (ICD-10: L40.3, L40.2) and Chinese medical termswere used to identify cases and estimate the prevalence and incidence of PPP in China. To summarize the incidence and prevalence of PPP worldwide, a systematic review was done among Web of Science, PubMed, SinoMed (China BioMedical Literature Service System), CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), and Wanfang Database up to January 2022, using the terms ""palmoplantar pustulosis"", ""incidence"" and ""prevalence"". Two researchers independently reviewed the title, abstract and full-text and extracted data from the studies relevant to the objectives. Results: The crude prevalence and incidence of PPP in 2016 in China were 2.73 (95% CI 2.22 to 3.24) and 1.56 (95% CI 1.15 to 1.96) per 100 000 person-years, respectively. We found a higher prevalence (2.91 vs. 2.49) and incidence (1.75 vs. 1.42) in females than in males, which showed a bimodal age distribution, with the first peak at 0-3 age group and the second peak at 30-39. Five relevant studies were included in the systematic review. The prevalence of PPP ranged from 5 to 120 per 100 000 person-years, i.e., Denmark 5, United States 9, Sweden 26, Korean 51, Germany 80/91, and Japan 120 per 100 000 person-years. Only one study calculated incidence which was 12.70 per 100 000 person-years in Sweden, and it was 5.40 per 100 000 person-years when the strict case criteria was used. Three studies reported the mean age of PPP from 52.20 to 61.20, and one study from Sweden said onset age was 56.40. Conclusions: The previous proposal that the prevalence and incidence of PPP might be higher in Asia than in Western countries was not supported. For the first time, our study found a bimodal pattern with the first peak onset at the 0-3 age group, which was corresponding to the innate immune dysfunction in the etiology of PPP. PPP mainly affected labor force population, suggesting a heavy indirect disease burden.

Objectives: This analysis describes the overall survival of an international cohort of eculizumab-treated patients compared with an untreated cohort using data from the International PNH Registry (NCT01374360). Methods: The study included patients with PNH enrolled in the Registry from March 2007-April 2021. Ever-treated patients received eculizumab for 35 days; never-treated patients did not receive eculizumab at any time. Baseline was defined as treatment initiation for evertreated and registry enrollment for never-treated patients. Cox proportional hazards modeling and Kaplan-Meier estimates were employed. Baseline covariates adjusted for were: presence of high disease activity (HDA) [defined as lactate dehydrogenase ratio 1.5 Â ULN with 1 clinical sign or symptom], age, sex, history of bone marrow failure (BMF), history of thrombotic events, transfusion dependence, and estimated glomerular filtration rate 60. Survival time was analyzed using 1) baseline as start time and 2) left-truncation, which analyzes followup time from baseline but maps this time from disease start date. Results: Baseline characteristics of the 1892 ever-treated and 2735 never treated patients were similar for age (44.6 [17.3] vs 46.4 [18.9] years) and sex (53% female). Compared with never-treated patients, more ever-treated patients had HDA (1105/1312 [84.2%] vs 684/2146 [31.9%]) and fewer had history of BMF (822/1010 [45%] vs 1969/2581 [76%]). Among ever-treated patients, those with HDA at baseline experienced the largest reduction in mortality risk (HR [95% CI], 0.46 [0.33-0.64]; n ,"" 174). Overall survival probability by treatment status was consistently greater in ever-treated vs. never-treated patients through 20 years of follow-up; survival probability at 20 years was 82% (ever-treated) vs 69% (never-treated) using left truncation. Results were similar without use of left truncation. Conclusions: Eculizumab treatment improved survival in patients with PNH compared with a never-treated cohort at a comparable time point in their disease course. Covariates were assessed at baseline only and competing risks and time on treatment were not controlled for, which are potential limitations. Though left truncation sought to minimize immortal bias, the bias persisted as some patients began treatment prior to enrollment.

Limited treatment options are available to manage symptoms. Life expectancy is approximately 7 years from symptom onset. Comorbid mood disorders are common with PSP but are not well understood, and limited data exists on treatment patterns with regards to medications for depression and anxiety with PSP. Our study seeks to better understand these patterns. Objectives: To describe treatment patterns of 50 patients diagnosed with PSP across North America, specifically for patients who are also taking medications to treat depression and/or anxiety. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 50 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PSP. Using a novel research platform, complete and deidentified medical records were requested, digitized, and abstracted by trained clinical abstractors. Date of records acquired ranged from 1997-2021, and medical records were sourced from 133 care centers. The analysis included medications with an indication for depression, anxiety, or other mood disorder. Descriptive statistics were used to convey cohort characteristics and longitudinal medication use. Results: In the cohort of 50 patients diagnosed with PSP, 52% were female and 48% were male. Mean age at diagnosis for these groups was 66 and 67 years, respectively. Mean range of available records for patients was 8 years, with the average record dated less than a year before diagnosis. 28% of patients were diagnosed with anxiety, 38% were diagnosed with depression, and 8% were diagnosed with an unspecified mood disorder (58% combined across conditions). 23 patients were prescribed 18 depression or anxiety indicated medications, with ongoing use of 23 of the 34 prescriptions.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using the IQVIA US Ambulatory electronic medical record database to identify patients with POTS in 2019. As there is no ICD-10 code for POTS, we utilized the SNOMED CT code (4159659) to identify patients. The denominator included any patient with 1 encounter/visit in 2019; the numerator included any patient with 1 SNOMED CT code (4159659) in 2019.

2859,"Background: Friedreich ataxia (FA) is a rare neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive loss of muscle control resulting in impaired movement and speech. Severe disability and premature mortality due to cardiac complications are common in the late stages of the disease. While the varied clinical manifestations of FA profoundly impact patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL), the relationships between FA symptoms and clinical manifestations, and other determinants of HRQoL impact in FA, have not yet been explored. Objectives: In this study, a conceptual model was developed to illustrate the HRQoL implications and burden of the symptoms and clinical manifestations experienced by individuals living with FA. Methods: The conceptual model was based on the published literature on the HRQoL impacts and broader lived experiences of those with FA; data describing HRQoL and its mediating factors in other disease areas was used to address gaps in the literature pertaining to FA. The model was continuously refined after review by clinical experts and individuals living with FA. Results: This conceptual model describes the mediating factors, drivers of impact, and outcomes that contribute to patient HRQoL in FA. Key mediating factors identified include patient characteristics, clinical manifestations, symptom severity, social and environmental factors. Individuals are affected by changes to their physical abilities and activities of daily living, social and emotional impacts, fatigue, and pain. The model recognizes the relationship between mediating factors, clinical health status, and functional and psychosocial outcomes in determining overall HRQoL. Conclusions: This work supports understanding of determinants of patient HRQoL in FA, including the relationships between various mediating factors and outcomes. Findings suggest that interventions are needed to address the clinical manifestations of FA, as well as the broader social and environmental factors that influence the burden of disease. The conceptual model also suggests the pathways through which FA interventions may improve HRQoL.",1.0,disease,True

2862,"Background: The progression of Friedreich Ataxia (FA) can result in severe disability, dramatically affecting the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients and caregivers. New therapies are under development and will require utility estimates for health states characterizing the HRQoL impact of FA. Objectives: This study aimed to compare the coverage of domains, validity, feasibility, and acceptability of generic preference-based measures (PBMs) for assessing the impact of FA on the HRQoL of patients and caregivers. Methods: Targeted literature reviews were conducted to identify drivers of HRQoL among FA patients and their caregivers, and relevant outcome measures to capture these impacts. Publications describing these measures were reviewed to understand coverage of relevant HRQoL drivers, validity for FA, respondent burden, and acceptability to selected health technology assessment agencies. Results: Key drivers of HRQoL among both patients and caregivers included impacts on fatigue/sleep, emotion/mood, and social interactions. Additional drivers were impacts on activities of daily living and physical function for patients; and impact on productivity and leisure activities, pain, and physical health for caregivers. Relevant generic PBMs identified during the review included the EQ-5D, Health Utilities Index (HUI), SF-6D, Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB), Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D), Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL), Care-related Quality of Life (CarerQoL), Carer Experience Scale (CES), and Adult Social Care Outcomes Toolkit for Carers (ASCOT-Carer). While most directly or indirectly covered many of the drivers, the SF-6D, EQ-5D, and HUI2 had the strongest balance of driver coverage, validity, feasibility, and acceptability among patient outcome measures; and the EQ5D, CarerQoL, and ASCOT-Carer among caregiver outcome measures. Conclusions: Generic PBMs covering FA-relevant constructs can provide important insights into the burden experienced by patients and their caregivers. These findings will help inform the choice of outcome measures for HRQoL studies in FA and upcoming health economic analyzes.",1.0,social,True

Objectives: To utilize a real-world data source to describe the occurrence of diagnosed sleep disorders, including insomnia, in patients newly diagnosed with WD. Methods: Patients newly diagnosed with WD were identified between 2016 and 2021 within the TriNetX Dataworks USA Network, an electronic health records database, which includes approximately 76 million patients from 48 healthcare organizations (HCOs) in the USA. Patients were included if they had  2 ICD codes for WD and at least one year of follow-up before and after diagnosis and no identified history of prescribed WD treatment (chelators or zinc). Patients with sleep disorders were identified via ICD code or an RxNorm code for prescribed sleep aids. The proportion of patients with a sleep disorder in the full TriNetX Dataworks population over five years of age was also determined as an estimate of prevalence of sleep disorders in the general population. Results: A total of 310 patients with WD were included in the analysis (mean age ± standard deviation (SD) 47 ± 19 years old, 42% male). Sleep disorders (including use of sleep aids) were diagnosed in 49 patients within the year prior to WD diagnosis (15.8%; 95% CI: 11.7%, 19.9%). Insomnia was diagnosed in 24 patients (7.7%; 95% CI: 4.8%, 10.7%) and was the most common of the sleep disorders among patients with WD, accounting for 55.8% of the patients with sleep disorders. In the year after diagnosis, 73 patients had a sleep disorder (23.5% (95% CI: 18.8%, 28.3%) and insomnia remained the most common sleep disorder (40.6%). Similar findings were observed in sensitivity analyzes among patients with two years look back and two years of follow-up data, and in analyzes restricted to patients not prescribed zinc or chelators (n ,"" 253, 81.6%). In the full TriNetX Dataworks population, 12.3% of patients had a diagnosed sleep disorder and 3.4% had insomnia. Patients with WD with insomnia were on average 54 years old, similar to the insomnia patients in the overall TriNetX network. Conclusions: Using electronic health records, these findings suggest that the prevalence of diagnosed sleep disorders, especially insomnia, in WD may be greater than general healthcare seeking population.

2870,"Heath Record (EHR) databases can support observational research in PAH; however, differentiating PAH patients from the overall PH patient population based on administrative codes is challenging. Objectives: The study objective was to develop guidance on the use of combinations of administrative codes for PAH patient identification (PAH algorithms), for aligned research in coded healthcare databases. PAH algorithm performance was evaluated by checking PAH patient cohorts identified based on administrative codes against their true clinical diagnoses. Methods: Patient records from the Vera Moulton Wall Center clinical PH database (true diagnoses) were linked with coded EHR data from Stanford University Medical Center. Over a dozen published PAH algorithms and clinically meaningful algorithm modifications were applied to separate PAH from non-PAH patients in the coded EHR data. Using the clinical PH database, each patient's cohort assignment was assessed against their true diagnoses. Results: Records from 720 PH patients (558 PAH and 162 non-PAH patients) from the clinical PH database could be linked with EHR data. Algorithms consisting of only 1 P(A)H-specific diagnosis code separated PAH patients from non-PAH patients with sensitivity >97% and positive predictive value (PPV) >79%, while specificity was <12%. Such algorithms tend to classify all PH patients as PAH patients. Highest specificity (100%) and PPV (100%) were obtained for an algorithm requiring 1 PAH diagnosis code OR 1 PH diagnosis code + 1 diagnosis code for a PAH-associated disease, AND 1 PAH drug code, AND exclusionary codes for other forms of PH. This algorithm did not classify non-PAH patients as PAH patients but missed 520 true PAH patients (sensitivity: 7%). The algorithm that was most balanced in terms of sensitivity, NPV and PPV (all > 70%) included 1 PH diagnosis AND 1 PAH drug AND exclusionary codes. Conclusions: There is no universal algorithm appropriate across all research questions. To identify a ""clean"" PAH cohort - e.g., for diagnostic studies -, a complex algorithm with combinations of diagnosis, procedure, drug, and exclusionary codes should be used. However, such an algorithm likely misses true PAH patients. To identify all PAH patients - e.g., for treatment pattern studies -, one diagnosis code might be sufficient, but the resulting cohort likely contains non-PAH patients, too.

Variables collected in this study included demographics, crizotinib treatment, medical and ocular history, ophthalmic examinations, and outcomes of any PSTE and SVL cases. An external expert adjudication committee determined whether reported cases were likely to be true cases of PSTE or SVL. Results: Cumulatively, 50 reported cases indicative of SVL or PSTE were received during the study; 42 of these 50 (84.0%) cases were from the spontaneous reporting system. Of those 50 reported cases, 46 were AE/SAE reports potentially indicative of SVL and 4 were AE/SAE reports potentially indicative of PSTE. Of the 46 reported cases potentially indicative of SVL, 5 cases were adjudicated as likely to be SVL, 10 cases as likely to be PSTE, 1 case to be a non-case, and 30 cases as insufficient information. Adjudication of the 4 reported cases indicative of PSTE found all 4 cases as likely to be PSTE. In total, there were 5 adjudicated SVL cases and 14 adjudicated PSTE cases. Two of the 5 adjudicated SVL cases were reported as unrelated to crizotinib and 3 cases were reported as unknown relationship. One of 14 adjudicated PSTE case was considered related to crizotinib. Associated risk factors for SVL/PSTE among the cases included a prior history of ocular disease (eg., cataracts, macular edema).

Methods: We conducted a new user, active-comparator cohort study using South Korea's nationwide health insurance claims data from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2020. The study cohort was patients with type 2 diabetes newly prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, with cohort entry defined as the first date of the prescription. Within this cohort, we classified patients into four discrete subgroups based on their baseline status and conducted 1:1 propensity score matching between users of SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP4 inhibitors in each subgroup: cardiovascular disease and diuretic use (CVD+/DU+); cardiovascular disease only (CVD+/DU-); diuretic use only (CVD-/DU+); without cardiovascular disease and diuretic use (CVD-/DU-). We estimated incidence rates per 1000 person-years and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox regression models for the risk of amputation associated with SGLT2 inhibitors versus DPP4 inhibitors. Results: Among 1 588 797 patients in the study cohort (mean [SD] age, 60.2 [13.7] years; 42.3% women), we identified 219 900 patient-pairs of SGLT2 inhibitor and DPP4 inhibitor users after propensity score matching. The incidence rate per 1000 person-years in SGLT2 inhibitor and DPP4 inhibitor users in the four groups were: CVD+/DU+ group, 0.45 vs 1.21; CVD+/DU-group, 0.30 vs 0.64; CVD-/DU+ group, 0.31 vs 0.57; and CVD-/DU- group, 0.25 vs 0.51. The HRs for the risk of amputation associated with SGLT2 inhibitors versus DPP4 inhibitors were 0.36 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.90) for the CVD+/DU+ group, 0.46 (0.21 to 1.01) for the CVD+/DU-group, 0.55 (0.27 to 1.14) for the CVD-/ DU+ group, and 0.49 (0.34 to 0.71) for the CVD-/DU-group. Conclusions: History of cardiovascular disease and/or diuretic use appeared to have no effects on the risk of amputation associated with SGLT2 inhibitors among patients with type 2 diabetes.

2901,"Background: The adrenal gland uses the cholesterol of low-density lipoproteins as a substrate to produce steroid hormones including mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids and sexual hormones. By inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, statins could reduce the synthesis of steroid hormones, thereby causing adrenal insufficiency (AI). Objectives: We aimed to study the potential statin-related risk of AI in a large nationwide database. Methods: We conducted a nested case-time control study using a cohort of patients 18y and affiliated to the General Scheme of the French Health Insurance database in 2010 (SNDS), without AI history. Cases were patients with a first event of AI between 01/01/2015 and 31/12/2017. AI was defined as the presence of both a hospital stay with a diagnosis of AI (ICD-10 codes E271 to E274), and a first dispensing of hydrocortisone ±30 days before/after hospital admission. Each case was matched to up to 10 controls on age (± 2 years), sex, and prior treatment with corticosteroids in the 3 years before the index date. Exposure to statin was measured over the 5 years preceding the index date using different definitions: history of use, cumulative use and intensity of last statin used. A 6-month censoring lag-time for exposure was applied before the index date to avoid a potential detection bias. Association was estimated using a conditional logistic regression adjusted on confounders including a disease risk score. Analyzes were stratified on age, sex and corticosteroid history of use. Sensitivity analyzes explored the impact of lag-time length for exposure by repeating the main analysis with a 3-month and without lag-time. Results: 4492 cases of AI were compared to 44 798 controls (median age 66y, 58% women), of which 39% vs. 33% were exposed to statins, respectively. No association between statin use and AI was found when adjusting the model for confounders, either for new-users of statin (adjusted OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.81-1.55), current users (0.97; 0.89-1.06) or past users (0.98; 0.871.09). A slight, but non significant, increase in AI risk was observed for new users of statins (1.12; 0.81- 1.55), and a risk reduction for patients whose last statin used was of low intensity (0.84; 0.73-0.98). In stratified analyzes, there was no difference in AI risk, neither according to sex nor according to corticosteroid history of use. A non significant higher risk was found in statin users aged 51 to 65 (1.12, 0.97-1.29). Sensitivity analyzes on lag-time provided consistent results. Conclusions: We found no relevant association between statin exposure and AI risk. The risk, if any, seems to be very limited and does not compromise the benefit of statin treatment.",1.0,case,True

2905,"Background: Some recent studies have suggested that benzodiazepines might trigger suicidal behaviors but the association remains suspected of bias. Objectives: This study aimed at estimating the risk of suicide attempt and suicide death associated with benzodiazepines using methods minimizing confounding factors. Methods: Case-crossover (CCO) study, based on data from the French reimbursement healthcare system (SNDS). Participants: 16y, with a suicidal act identified between 2013 and 2016, and at least one benzodiazepine dispensing over the previous 120-day ""observation period"". According to psychiatric history in the year before the observation period (yes/no), two populations were defined. Benzodiazepine dispensing was self-compared between a risk-period (days [À30, À1] before the act) and two reference periods (days [À120, À91] and [À90, À61]). Analyzes were adjusted for time-varying confounders (psychotropic drugs). To strengthen bias control, we performed a second CCO using cyamemazine as a negative control with similar risk of indication bias, and a case-case-time-control design to address time-trend bias. Results: Among the ""non-psychiatric population"", 34 076 individuals attempted suicide (41.8% men; mean age, 44.8 ± 18.0 years), and 4354 deceased by suicide (77.7% men; 61.2 ± 18.4 years). We found an increased dispensing of benzodiazepines in the 30 days before suicide attempt (adjusted OR 2.77; 95% CI: 2.69-2.86) and suicide (1.80; 1.65-1.97). Among the ""psychiatric population"", 77 474 cases attempted suicide (33.1% men; 48.8 ± 15.0 years) and 7958 died from suicide (58.4% men; 56.7 ± 16.0 years): benzodiazepine dispensing during the 30-day risk-period was significantly associated with both suicide attempt (1.74; 1.69-1.78) and suicide (1.45; 1.34-1.57). The risk persisted in the complementary analyzes. Conclusions: Using methods with increased bias control, this nationwide study supports an association between benzodiazepine and suicidal behaviors. Even if residual confounding cannot be ruled-out, these results strengthen the need for awareness and monitoring when prescribing benzodiazepines, and plea for the importance of screening for suicidal risk carefully before initiation.",1.0,Case,True

Therefore, this is a pressing issue as the number of obese individuals in the US has constantly increased from 30.5% in 1999 to 42.4% in 2018. Objectives: To assess the incidence and risk of major and minor bleeding of factor Xa inhibitors and warfarin in obese and morbidly obese NVAF patients. Methods: This was a propensity-score-matched retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records in the US from June 2012 to December 2020. Obese and morbidly obese individuals with NVAF with the first prescription of rivaroxaban, apixaban, or warfarin (index date) were included. Patients with valve disease, transient atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, pregnancy, or knee or hip replacement surgery were excluded. Major bleeding was defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria and minor bleeding if it did not meet the criteria. Patients were followed for at least 12 months from the index date until the first occurrence of major and minor bleeding. The incidence density rates, and Cox regression were calculated. The adjusted p-value <0.0083 with Bonferroni correction. Results: Three matched (1:1) cohorts were created: apixaban (292) versus warfarin (292), rivaroxaban (250) versus warfarin (250), and apixaban (271) versus rivaroxaban (271). The incidence of major bleeding outcomes was significantly higher in obese people on warfarin versus apixaban (p-value , 0.0037) and in obese and morbidly obese people on warfarin versus rivaroxaban (p-value , 0.0037).

Objectives: To evaluate the real-world comparative risk of betablockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) for patients with COPD and AF. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the National Health Insurance Database from 2009-2018. Patients with prevalent COPD and incident AF were enrolled in this study. We divided patients into BB or CCB group based on the first prescription (the date was index date) after the first AF diagnosis and excluded patients received both BB and CCB. The primary outcome was allcause mortality, and secondary outcome was emergency room visit or hospitalization due to COPD with acute exacerbation (COPDAE). We collected baseline characteristic 1-year before index date and presented as mean (standard deviation, SD) or number (percentage). We applied Kaplan-Meier method to estimate cumulative incidence rate and log-rank test to determine the difference. Finally, we used coxproportional hazard model to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Total 41523 patients were enrolled in this study, 22598 in BB group (54.4%) and 18925 in CCB group (45.6%). We found 57.1% patients received selective BB in BB group. From baseline characteristic, the history of CHF, MI and ischemic heart disease (IHD) were respectively 43.2%, 7.9%, and 45.5% in BB group and 41.9%, 4.9% and 38.8% in CCB group. During 1 year before index date, 10.5% in BB group and 17% in CCB group had at least 1 episode of COPDAE, whereas 2.5% in BB group and 7.1% in CCB group occurred three times and above. After 1-year follow-up, the mortality was 23% in BB group and 34% in CCB group Log-rank test also showed significant difference for 2 groups in mortality and COPDAE. Finally, compared with CCB group, BB group was associated with a lower risk of mortality (adjusted HR , 0.86; 95% CI 0.83-0.88) and lower risk of COPDAE (adjusted HR ,"" 0.68; 95% CI 0.65-0.71). Moreover, we applied several subgroup analyzes and found that either selective BB or nonselective BB had a lower risk of mortality and COPDAE. We also found that regardless of patient with CHF and MI or not, the risk was lower in BB group. Conclusions: The use of BB in patients with COPD and AF associated with a lower risk of mortality and COPDAE compared with use of CCB. The association was independent of the selectivity of BB, presence or absence of CHF and MI. In further studies, subgroup analysis of severe COPD cases and other sensitivity analysis are needed.""",1.0,trial,True

2921,"Background: Osteoporotic fractures are a debilitating condition associated with high morbidity. Several reports have linked use of antipsychotics to the development of osteoporotic fractures by increasing serum prolactin. However, it is not clear which antipsychotic medication has a higher risk of developing osteoporotic fractures. Objectives: To summarize evidence on differential risk of osteoporotic fractures associated with use of antipsychotic medications. Methods: Observational studies were retrieved by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and PsychINFO up to January 2022. We included analytical studies in which the risk of osteoporotic/any fractures in users of individual antipsychotic medications was compared to the risk in nonusers. In conducting the search, two reviewers screened full-text articles for inclusion, performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa tool. A meta-analysis was conducted for 1) risperidone and 2) haloperidol versus non-users of antipsychotics using a random-effects model. Results: In total 1595 titles and abstracts were screened, and 50 studies were reviewed in full text. The inclusion criteria were met by eight studies. Antipsychotic-user populations varied; two studies included individuals older than 65. Three studies included individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and parkinsonism. Whereas three studies included general antipsychotic users. The highest risk of fractures was associated with haloperidol, zulcopentixol, risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine use. However, included studies were not directly comparable due to differences in comparator choice and study design. Therefore, only four studies comparing risperidone use and three comparing haloperidol use to non-antipsychotic use were included in the meta-analysis. There was no evidence of an association between use of risperidone and development of osteoporotic fractures (OR ,"" 1.12, 95% CI 0.94-1.33), with moderate variability between studies (I2 "","" 27%).

Objectives:To compare the risk of CDI in Taiwan hospitalized patients who exposed to PPIs and H2RAs for SUP between 2017 to 2018. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study by using the National Health Insurance Database (NHID) to identify hospitalized patients aged above 20 years old who used PPIs or H2RAs during hospitalization between 2017 to 2018. Patients with records of PPIs or H2RAs 180 days before index date or history of gastrointestinal ulcer 180 days prior to admission date were excluded. Eligible patients were then grouped according to their first prescriptions and followed at most 90 days from the admission date. The date of their first prescription of PPIs or H2RAs was defined as the index date. Patients were censored when the occurrence of CDI, discontinuation, switch, death, or end of observation, whichever came first. CDI was defined as having prescription of metronidazole, fidaxomicin, and oral vancomycin over 7 days plus either the records of C.difficle toxin test or CDI diagnosis (ICD-9 ,"" 008.45, ICD-10"",""A04.7). Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the risk of CDI between two groups, and the results were presented as adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: A total of 406 926 patients were identified, 49.3% used PPIs and 50.7% used H2RAs. Both groups had mean age around 67 years old and similar length of hospitalization about 17 days [mean 17.6 (SD 14.8), 16.1(SD 13.8)]. Incidence of CDI were higher among patients in PPIs than those in H2RAs (3.8 vs 3.1 per 10 000 patents-days), and risk of CDI in PPIs group was significantly higher than H2RAs group (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.02-1.33). To consolidate the outcome measurement, we extended the prescription of CDI treatment from 7 days to 10 days as sensitivity analysis, and the comparable result confirms the robustness of the result. Conclusions: In Taiwan hospitalized patients who used PPIs for SUP have higher incidence rate of CDI than that of H2RAs. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the risk of CDI in patients who used PPIs and H2RAs and evaluate the necessity of SUP in hospitalized patients.""",1.0,,True

Methods: R-packages for extracting free-text medication prescription instructions in a structured form (doseminer) and an algorithm for transparently processing this information (drugprepr) were developed (available on CRAN). Data from Clinical Practice Research Datalink were used to identify adult patients without cancer, with at least 1 opioid prescription during 2017. To define drug exposure, prescription duration was defined as (quantity of tablets x drug interval)/ numerical daily dose [ndd]). Ndd was defined as drug number x drug frequency. Doseminer was used to extract numerical values from free text (e.g. ""take up to eight tablets/day"" to dose number 0-8; dose interval 1 day). Drugprepr allowed computation of ndd using different minimum, mean, maximum drug number and frequency assumptions.

Results: During the study window, 60 394 patients were identified with 190 754 opioids prescriptions of which 41.6% prescriptions were PRN.

The distribution of hazard ratio as a function of the decisions ranged from 2.64 (95% CI: 2.23, 3.12) to 3.30 (95% CI: 2.78, 3.90). Conclusions: Assumptions made during the drug preparation process, especially for PRN drugs or those that have variability in prescription instructions, can impact the results of subsequent risk estimates.

The leuprolide exposed cohort included patients with a CPP diagnosis during the 183 days before (baseline) leuprolide initiation (index date). The first leuprolide unexposed cohort was patients diagnosed with CPP, indexed on median time from the first CPP diagnosis to exposure summarized from the leuprolide exposed cohort. The second unexposed cohort was individuals with no baseline CPP diagnosis, indexed on the first well visit. All 3 cohorts had no baseline long-acting GnRH agonist use.

2994,"Background: Novel oral anticoagulant (NOACs) is now frequently used in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), venous thromboembolism (VTE), VTE prophylaxis, stroke prevention, valve disorders, and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In recent years, safety alerts have been issued due to the risk of adverse events associated with NOACs. The safety signals raised in term of bleeding-related adverse events of NOACs is still controversial. Objectives: 1. To evaluate the risk of adverse events associated with NOACs in patients with various indications such as AF, VTE, VTE prophylaxis, stroke, and CVD. 2. To estimate the ranking and hierarchy of interventions based on the safety of NOACs.

To address this gap, we conducted a replication of selected results from vACCine COVID-19 monitoring readinESS (ACCESS) in the EU with data from Electronic health Records (EHR) in the US. Objectives: Using data from the Optum EHR in the US from 2017 through 2019, we aimed to reproduce the incidence rates (IRs) from EU ACCESS for the following Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs): Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS), stress cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis alone and with pericarditis. Methods: AESI definitions from 9 databases across 7 EU countries were abstracted from the online ACCESS documentation (https:// zenodo.org/). IRs were estimated with patient data from the Optum EHR using the definitions from the ACCESS `narrow concepts.' In the Optum EHR and ACCESS, a one-year washout period after database entry was required to establish an index date for follow up and qualify a patient for incident events. IRs from the Optum EHR were compared to those reported in ACCESS for all ages and each year from 2017 to 2020. IR point estimates from Optum EHR that fell within the range of the point estimates from ACCESS were interpreted as evidence of a successful replication.

Objectives: To assess the association between the usage of antipsychotics in patients with hospital-acquired delirium after discharge and the risk of death. Methods: Between 2011 and 2018, we used Taiwan's National Health Insurance Database (NHID) to conduct a nested case-control study. To avoid misclassification of delirium diagnosis, we included people diagnosed with hospital-acquired delirium while excluding those diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar illness, or depression. Case patients were individuals who died within 180 days after discharge, then control patients were matched with a ratio of up to 1:5 in age, sex, and days after discharge. We used conditional logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 percent confidence intervals (CIs) on the mortality risk in patients with hospitalacquired delirium after discharge receiving antipsychotics compared to those who did not. Moreover, we considered variables reviewed from the literature as well as expert opinions. To examine the association, we stratified patients into two groups: those with dementia and those without. Furthermore, since QTc prolongation is a problem for patients on antipsychotics, we evaluated patients with arrhythmia to sort out the potential confounder. Results: There were a total of 13 219 cases and 56 301 matched controls in this study. The average age was 79.2 (SD 13.1) years, and males accounted for 55 percent of the cohort.

Objectives: To compare risk of ISH, suicide, and a composite outcome of ISH or suicide in older men treated with 5-ARIs vs. alpha-blockers for BPH. Methods: Using Medicare data linked to the National Death Index (NDI) from Jan 1, 2007 through Dec 31, 2016, we implemented a new user, active comparator, retrospective cohort design in males aged 65 and older with BPH who initiated treatment with 5-ARIs (dutasteride 0.5mg or finasteride 5mg) or alpha-blockers (alfuzosin, silodosin, and tamsulosin) that are indicated for BPH. ISH events were identified by ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes in inpatient or outpatient emergency department settings. Suicides were identified through cause-of-death information from NDI. We used inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) Cox proportional hazards regression to compare time-to-event between the two treatment groups, with robust variance estimation. Statistical significance was determined using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of hazard ratios (HRs) and two-tailed-tests (p-value  0.05).

Objectives: To compare all-cause mortality risks of pimavanserin compared to preferred AAPs and non-preferred AAPs in PD psychosis Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study consisting of individuals with PD who were new users of pimavanserin and other AAPs using 2016-2021 Optum's de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart. Pimavanserin users were matched to preferred AAP or nonpreferred AAP users via propensity scores, and baseline characteristics before and after matching were compared using standardized differences.

3034,"Background: Nausea is one of the most common adverse effects of opioid-treatment. In our everyday practice, we are often confronted with the statement that oxycodone is less likely to induce nausea than morphine. However, the evidence of this statement is sparse. Objectives: To assess the association between initiation of opioids and antiemetic therapy, and assess the difference in risk among initiators of morphine and oxycodone. Methods: A symmetry analysis was employed on all adults living in Denmark (2020: 4 666 625), who filled in their first prescription of a strong opioid, morphine or oxycodone, in the period of 1996- 2019 and initiated antiemetic therapy (propulsives and serotoninagonists) 30 days prior to or after this date. Individuals with a diagnosis of cancer up to opioid-initiation were excluded. A symmetrical distribution of prescriptions before and after opioid-initiation is expected if no association between opioids and antiemetics exists (i.e. a sequence ratio (SR) of 1.0). Using morphine as the active comparator, we estimated the active comparator adjusted SR of being prescribed antiemetic therapy up to 30 days after initiating oxycodone compared to initiating morphine. The active comparator adjusted SR for oxycodone was estimated using the simple ratio approach. Results: A total of 17 274 individuals filled in their first-ever prescription of antiemetic therapy within 30 days before or after their first ever opioid prescription; 12 229 individuals filled their prescription of an opioid before filling a prescription of antiemetic therapy, and 5045 individuals filled their prescriptions in the opposite order (SR 2.42, 95% CI 2.35-2.51). The majority were females (n ,"" 11 772, 68, 1%) with a median age of 73 years (IQR 58-84 years). The SR was 1.96 (95% CI 1.88-2.05) if the initial opioid prescription was morphine, and 3.28 (95% CI 3.11-3.46) if the initial opioid was oxycodone. The OR for oxycodone with morphine as reference was 1.68 (95% CI 1.57-1.80). The absolute risk of filling a prescription of antiemetic therapy within 30 days following initiation of oxycodone was 1127 per 100 000 adult oxycodone users without cancer. For patients initiating antiemetic therapy within 30 days following initiation of morphine, the absolute risk was 770 per 100 000 adult morphine users without cancer. Conclusions: Individuals initiating oxycodone as their first opioid for non-cancer pain were more likely to be prescribed antiemetic therapy compared to individuals initiating morphine as their initial opioid. This suggests that oxycodone may be more emetogenic than morphine.""",1.0,,True

3045,"Background: Historically, studies have reported increased risk of hip fracture following exposure to antidepressants while noting the potential for bias and confounding in this association. With changing patterns of care over time, it is important to update prior studies in other data sources and time periods. Objectives: To replicate and update a landmark case-control study of the antidepressant-hip fracture association (Hubbard 2003), conducted using UK CPRD over 1987-1999, in a large US claims database with recent data. Methods: Patients with diagnosis of hip fracture or fractured neck of femur between 2010-0101 and 2019-12-31 were identified in Optum's de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database. Index was first recorded fracture for cases. Controls were a random sample of patients with no record of hip fracture and were matched 1:2 on age, sex, and years enrolled. Matched data was analyzed using conditional logistic regression. The impact of first prescriptions was estimated for tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in days 0-14, 15-42, and 43+ of continuous treatment, allowing for treatment gaps up to 30 days. Potential confounding variables were included in adjusted models if, in bivariate models, inclusion resulted in change of odds ratio (OR) for antidepressants of at least 10%. Results: 170 738 patients with diagnosis of hip fracture were matched to 295 260 controls. Mean (SD) age of matched cases was 75.6 (15.0) and 67.5% were female. Cohort characteristics were similar to Hubbard. Rates of exposure to TCAs pre-index were 4.24% for cases and 2.76% for controls. Rates for SSRIs pre-index were 22.6% and 14.17%. Rates for TCAs were higher in Hubbard (cases: 17.8%; controls: 11.8%) and lower for SSRIs (5.5% and 3.0%). History of exposure to opiates was identified as a confounder for both TCAs and SSRIs; history of exposure to benzodiazepines was identified as a confounder for TCAs. Adjusted ORs for days 0-14, 15-42, and 43+ preindex for TCAs were OR(CI): [2.42(1.93, 3.04), 1.90(1.60, 2.26), and 1.27(1.23, 1.32)], while SSRIs were [1.73(1.47, 2.04), 2.24(2.09, 2.40), and 1.48(1.46, 1.51)]. Corresponding results from Hubbard et al were [4.76(3.06, 7.41), 2.58(1.88, 3.53), and 1.15 (1.08, 1.23)] for TCAs and [6.30(2.65, 14.97), 4.30(2.39, 7.74), and 1.32(1.19, 1.48)] for SSRIs.

3048,"Background: The ORAL Surveillance (OS) post-authorization safety trial suggested an increased risk of major cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) taking tofacitinib (tofa) compared to the tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) etanercept or adalimumab. To assess the concordance of OS findings in routine patient care, the association between tofa versus TNFi and CV events was assessed in a real-world setting using principled pharmacoepidemiology methods. Objectives: To compare the risk of CV events between tofa vs. TNFitreated patients with RA aged >50 with >1 CV risk factor, and methotrexate use in the year prior. Methods: Using Optum Clinformatics® an OS cohort mimicking trial inclusion/exclusion criteria was created. Patients meeting study criteria from Nov 2012-Dec 2020 were followed from initiation of tofa or TNFi for a CV event until the end of index drug exposure, insurance disenrollment, or end of data. The outcome was a composite of incident myocardial infarction or stroke/transient ischemic attack. Cox proportional hazards regression estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) between 1:1 propensity score-matched treatment groups. Results: The final cohort included 2378 patients (mean age 63 years, 81% female). The incidence rate per 100 person-years for CV events among tofa and TNFi initiators, respectively, was 1.62 (0.98-2.54) and 1.02 (0.53-1.78). The HR was elevated in the main analysis (1.61; 0.78-3.32). The point estimate attenuated in a sensitivity analysis using time-varying exposure/covariates (1.22; 0.63-1.61) albeit, despite increased precision in the sensitivity analysis, CIs included the null. Conclusions: Replicating methodology from OS in real-world data yielded point estimates for tofa vs. TNFi treated patients above one for MACE in an OS like real-world cohort. In a time-dependent analysis, the point estimate was attenuated. Confidence intervals from both primary and sensitivity analyzes included the null.

We included patients aged 18-85 years with at least 2 years of previous data and an incident diagnosis of melanoma or non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) cases and controls (matched 10:1 by age and sex). We excluded immunosuppressed subjects. We defined ever use as any prescription record and high use as a cumulative exposure of at least 200g (reference: never use). The cumulative dose was categorized for dose-response assessment. We used conditional logistic regression models to compute ORs (95% CI) adjusted for photosensitizing, antineoplastic, disease-specific drugs, and comorbidities. Results: We identified a total of 7809 melanoma cases in SIDIAP, 4661 in BIFAP and 21 978 in Denmark; 64 230 NMSC cases in SIDIAP, 31 063 in BIFAP; and 152 821 in Denmark, and approximately 10 times as many controls.

Objectives: This study aimed to develop a prediction model for an individual's risk of muscle disorders to support clinical decision making on statin treatment, as part of a research project for STRAtifying Treatments In the multi-morbid Frail elderlY (STRATIFY). Methods: An observational cohort study was designed to derive the model, using electronic healthcare records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database in the UK. Males aged over 50 and females aged over 60, who were potentially eligible for statin treatment, were followed-up for hospitalization or death with a diagnosis of muscle disorders within ten years. Patient characteristics, comorbidities and medications including statins were selected as predictors based on the literature and expert opinions. The model was derived using the Fine-Gray sub-distribution hazards approach, taking into account the competing risk. External validation in the CPRD Aurum database examined the model's discrimination using the C statistic and the calibration using the observed/expected ratio (O/E) and calibration slope. Results: The cohort for model derivation included 1 785 207 patients, with a mean age of 64 and 44% females. Patients prescribed statins were predicted to have a higher risk of muscle disorders. Other important predictors that increased the risk of muscle disorders included female sex, obesity, frailty, previous muscle problems, vitamin D deficiency, mild liver diseases and concomitant myotoxic medications. External validation in 3 889 504 patients showed a good discrimination (C statistic 0.7821, 95% CI: 0.7818-0.7824) and calibration (O/E 0.87, 95% CI: 0.85-0.88; calibration slope 1.06, 95% CI: 1.05- 1.07) of the model for the ten-year risk prediction. The model performance was similar for the prediction at one and five years. Conclusions: This model uses routinely available patient characteristics and medical history to accurately predict an individual's risk of muscle disorders. It could assist communication between physicians and patients about the benefit-harm trade-off of statin treatment and help make well-informed shared clinical decisions.",1.0,disease,True

3064,"Background: While hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) is an important outcome in clinical and epidemiologic studies, the appropriate definition to identify HHF in database research is still undetermined. Objectives: To develop and validate algorithms to identify HHF in healthcare databases. Methods: This validation study was conducted in adults with gout or urate-lowering drugs who were admitted to a medical center in Taiwan. A random sample of 300 hospitalization events with HF-related discharge diagnosis in the first five coding positions between 2014 and 2017 was selected as the validation cohort (150 each for the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM eras). Algorithms to identify HHF were developed with a combination of different lists of HF-related diagnosis codes, diagnostic positions, use of intravenous (IV) loop diuretics, IV inotropes, augmentation of oral loop diuretics, renal replacement therapy (RRT), and elevation of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level (if tested). Manual chart review by two independent cardiologists was used as the reference standard for evaluating developed algorithms. HHF case ascertainment was based on the consensus definitions for HHF (as endpoint events in clinical trials) and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities criteria. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were assessed. Results: Of all the sampled hospitalizations, 62 (41%) in the ICD9-CM era and 47 (31%) in the ICD-10-CM era were adjudicated as definite HHF. The algorithms solely with diagnosis codes in the first five coding positions showed the worst PPVs (0.40 and 0.31 respectively). The algorithm which contained ""diagnosis code of ICD-9-CM 428.x or ICD-10-CM I50.x in the first two coding positions"" and ""IV loop diuretics or IV inotropes"" (with or without the criterion of ""augmentation of oral loop diuretics"") had the best performance. This algorithm exhibited a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 0.79 (95% CI 0.69-0.90), 0.88 (0.81-0.95), 0.81 (0.710.91), and 0.87 (0.80-0.94) respectively in the ICD-9-CM era, and 0.74 (0.62-0.87), 0.91 (0.860.96), 0.78 (0.66-0.90), and 0.90 (0.84-0.95) respectively in the ICD-10-CM era. Adding RRT or elevation of NT-proBNP did not significantly enhance the sensitivity or PPV of the algorithms. Conclusions: Our results suggest that adopting an explicit code definition of HF in the first two coding positions, combined with the use of IV loop diuretics and IV inotropes, attained an acceptable level of sensitivity and PPV for identifying HHF in both the ICD-9-CM and ICD10-CM eras in healthcare databases.",1.0,clinical,True

3067,"Background: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are antidiabetic drugs that interact with sulfonylureas and increase their risk of hypoglycemia. However, it is unknown whether this risk varies with the pharmacologic properties of DPP-4 inhibitors (peptidomimetic vs non-peptidomimetic). Objectives: To assess the risk of severe hypoglycemia associated with concomitant use of sulfonylureas with peptidomimetic DPP-4 inhibitors (vildagliptin, saxagliptin) compared with concomitant use of sulfonylureas with non-peptidomimetic DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, linagliptin, alogliptin) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used the United Kingdom's Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to hospitalization and vital statistics data. We included patients initiating sulfonylurea treatment between 2007 and 2020. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of severe hypoglycemia (defined as hospitalization with or death due to hypoglycemia) associated with concomitant use of sulfonylureas with peptidomimetic DPP-4 inhibitors compared to concomitant use of sulfonylureas with non-peptidomimetic DPP-4 inhibitors, adjusted for baseline covariates. We also assessed potential effect measure modifications by age and sex. Sensitivity analyzes assessed potential exposure and outcome misclassification. Results: The study cohort included 196 138 sulfonylurea initiators. Median (interquartile range) follow-up was 6.02 (2.93-9.16) years, during which 8576 events of severe hypoglycemia occurred (crude incidence rate, 7.17 [95% CI, 7.02 to 7.32] per 1000 person-years). When compared with concomitant use of sulfonylureas with nonpeptidomimetic DPP-4 inhibitors, concomitant use of sulfonylureas with peptidomimetic DPP-4 inhibitors was not associated with an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.22). There was effect modification by sex, with concomitant use of sulfonylureas with peptidomimetic DPP-4 inhibitors being associated with a numerically increased risk of severe hypoglycemia among female patients (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.81) and a decreased risk among male patients (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.99; p for heterogeneity , 0.009). Age did not modify the association. Sensitivity analyzes yielded findings that were consistent with those of the primary analysis. Conclusions: Our study showed no increased risk of severe hypoglycemia associated with concomitant use of sulfonylureas and peptidomimetic DPP-4 inhibitors compared with concomitant use of sulfonylureas with non-peptidomimetic DPP-4 inhibitors.

However, there is scant population-based evidence characterizing the pattern of use and safety profile of these opioids in the MDD setting. Objectives: To characterize the use and safety profile of buprenorphine and tramadol in a real-world target population with MDD. Methods: We performed a retrospective new-user cohort study of privately insured US adults with MDD, aged 18 to 64 years, who initiated buprenorphine or tramadol between January 2007 and December 2014 (index date) in the IQVIA PharMetrics® Plus for Academics Database. We ascertained the cumulative incidence of opioid exposure, the primary outcome of serious acute adverse events (composite of respiratory depression, seizure, myocardial infarction, kidney injury, liver injury, and hypoglycemia), and the secondary outcome of all-cause emergency room department visits and hospitalizations. Cumulative incidence was computed using Poisson regression, and inverse probability weighted Cox model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the primary and secondary outcomes comparing tramadol users to buprenorphine users. Results: A total of 7218 buprenorphine new users and 128 539 tramadol new users were included in the study. The median number of prescriptions dispensed per month (and the average days' supply per prescription) was 2 (20 days) for buprenorphine and 35 (23 days) for tramadol. There was a statistically significant linear trend in the cumulative incident use of buprenorphine or tramadol from year 2007 to 2014. Compared to buprenorphine, tramadol was associated with a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of serious opioidrelated acute adverse events (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.16, 1.21) and a statistically significant reduction in all-cause ER visits and hospitalizations (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.95, 0.97). Conclusions: In commercially insured adults with MDD, the off-label use of buprenorphine and tramadol was common. The risk of serious adverse events did differ between buprenorphine and tramadol, with tramadol associated with an increase in the occurrence of serious acute adverse events and a reduction in all-cause ER visits and hospitalizations.

To assess the concordance of OS findings in routine patient care, the association between tofa versus adalimumab/etanercept and malignancies was assessed in a realworld setting using principled pharmacoepidemiology methods. Objectives: In a population similar to OS, to compare the risk of malignancy excluding NMSC between tofa vs TNFi treated patients with RA aged >50 with >1 cardiovascular risk factor, and methotrexate use in the year prior. Methods: Using Optum Clinformatics® claims data, a cohort was created mimicking OS inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients meeting study criteria from Nov 2012-Dec 2020 were followed from initiation of tofa or TNFi until censoring at the first of: malignancy excluding NMSC, initiation of another janus kinase inhibitor, insurance disenrollment, or end of data. Exposure classification was hierarchical: once exposure to tofa occurred, time could not be attributed to the TNFi treatment group. Patients exposed to tofa were considered always exposed, even upon discontinuation or switch to TNFi. Patients initiating a TNFi could contribute to both treatment groups. Upon a switch to tofa, patients enter the tofa group and no longer contribute person-time to the TNFi group. A Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying exposure and covariates was fitted comparing 1:1 propensity score(PS)-matched treatment groups. Results: The study included 2378 patients (mean age 63 years, 81% female) with 113 events and a median [IQR] follow-up time of 253 [135, 506] days, and median [IQR] time on tofa of 224 [119, 456] days. The hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) comparing tofa initiators to TNFi initiators was 1.11 (0.76-1.61) vs an HR of 1.48 (1.04-2.09) in OS. (Standard errors in this analysis were not adjusted for PS-matching and may result in narrower CI's.) Conclusions: This study did not find a similarly increased risk of malignancy in patients treated with tofa vs. TNFi in a real-world setting. This discrepancy for a long-latency event may be partly attributable to limited follow-up time in claims and different patterns of drug use across routine patient care and clinical trial settings. OS had a prolonged duration of therapy (3.5 years on average) compared to <1 year in this real-world data study.

Patients were classified into subgroups to represent disease severity, by their mean daily dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) purchased during 2017-2018, as well as by purchases of second controller (long-acting beta agonist, LABA and/or leukotriene receptor antagonists) and short-acting beta agonists (SABA). The medical record of a sample of 200 patients was reviewed by pulmonologist for further validation. Patients were characterized according to sociodemographic variables and asthma related variables. Results: We identified 143 813 asthma patients. The mean age on Dec 31 2018 was 40.01 (±19.43) and 73 441 (51.1%) were females. Diagnosis of asthma by a specialist was available for 58 205 (40.5%) patients. The proportion of past/current smokers was 14.2% among those age 18 years. The distribution of subgroups was (in order of decreased disease severity): High dose ICS n , 4240 (2.9%); Medium dose ICS n , 8027 (5.6%); low dose ICS n , 13 118 (9.1%); very low dose ICS n , 30 775 (21.4%); SABA only n , 15 225 (10.6%); no treatment (did not purchase ICS/ LABA/SABA or did not purchase any drug for asthma) n ,"" 72 428 (50.4%). The results of the medical records review were consistent with the identification and classification criteria. Older age was associated with increased disease severity (no treatment 38.15 ± 18.19 vs. high dose ICS 52.84 ± 21.01, P < 0.001). The proportion of factors assessed in 2018, that may indicate of poor control of asthma also increased with disease severity: using 3 SABA inhalers; 2 courses of oral corticosteroids (OCS); chronic use of OCS; 1 hospitalization. Conclusions: The current study offers criteria for the identification of asthma patients and classification of its severity. Identifying those with uncontrolled asthma will enable healthcare providers to offer them appropriate treatment and possibly prevent future exacerbations, hospitalization and improve the patients' quality of life.""",1.0,respiratory,True

3088,"Background: In some of the patients with a COVID-19 infection, symptoms persist for longer than three months (post-COVID syndrome (PCS)), but little is known about how this affects the quality of life (QoL). For a complete understanding of the effects of PCS on QoL, we combine patient experiences from questionnaires with clinical data from electronic health records (EHRs) of general practitioners (GPs). Objectives: What is the quality of life of patients with post-COVID syndrome three and six months after a COVID-19 infection? Methods: In 2021, Nivel, the Netherlands Institute for Health Services initiated the Nivel Corona Cohort. We selected patients with a COVID-19 registration (ICPC code R83.03) in their EHRs from Nivel Primary Care Database and invited them to participate via their GP. Patient recruitment occurred between January and September 2021. Participants receive four questionnaires with questions about the COVID-19 infection, persistent symptoms, lifestyle and QoL (SF12, score from 0-100) from before the COVID-19 infection and three and six months later. After patients' permission, we linked data from questionnaires to data from the EHR. The EHR data contains information about comorbidities (ICPC), contact with GPs and drug use (ATC). PCS was defined as the presence of at least one COVID-19-related complaint three months after the corona infection, and whether the patient experiences discomfort or is not fully recovered. We analyzed the association between QoL and gender and age and we compared the QoL of patients with and without PCS. In follow-up analyzes, we will study which clinical factors from the EHR data, such as comorbidities and drug use, are associated with a lower QoL. Results: 442 patients from 18 general practices participate in the Nivel Corona Cohort. 178 (40.3%) of these patients had PCS as defined above. Initial analyzes show that both the mental and physical QoL of people with PCS was significantly lower three months after COVID-19 infection (mean 48.1 (SD 10.6) and 41.0 (SD 10, 6), respectively), than in people without PCS (54.7 (SD 5.9) and 53.6 (SD 4.7), respectively). There was no significant difference in QoL between men and women after three months. The reduced physical and mental QoL also persisted in people with PCS six months after the COVID-19 infection. Women with PCS had a significantly lower physical QoL than men after 6 months (respectively 37.6 (SD 10.0) and 42.3 (SD 8.4), p ,"" 0.01), but not a lower mental QoL. Older people with PCS had better mental QoL at three and six months than younger people, but there was no difference in physical QoL. Conclusions: Persistent complaints after a COVID-19 infection, or PCS, have a long-term influence on the QoL. Linking data from EHRs and questionnaires provides more insight into which factors are related to this.""",1.0,COVID-19,True

However, the treatment-eligible G12C mutant NSCLC population, has not been well characterized, nor have its outcomes with current treatment approach. Objectives: To characterize a nationwide real-world G12C mutant NSCLC population and to estimate its overall survival (OS). Methods: Adult aNSCLC patients diagnosed between January first, 2018 and October 3first, 2020 were identified using the Danish Lung Cancer Register, which contains data on all Danish lung cancer patients since 2003. Additional information was gathered from the following registers: the Danish National Patient Register, the Danish Pathology Register and the Danish Civil Registration System. The study period was from January 1, 2018, to March 31, 2021, providing a follow-up time  6 months from NSCLC-diagnosis for all included patients. The primary outcome was OS from diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included a characterization of the study population including KRAS mutation status, demographics, clinical characteristics, tumor characteristics, treatment history (LOT, type of therapy), and genetic co-mutation profile, as well as time-to-next-treatment (TTNT) and OS from LOT1 and LOT2.

Objectives: To assess changes in the utilization of lidocaine plasters following a restriction on their coverage, and regional variation following this. Methods: This interrupted time series study of Ireland's GMS state drug scheme used aggregate region-level data from the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (2015-2019).

Objectives: To investigate the utilization of APM following a hospitalization for patients with COVID-19 and other infections. Methods: This study used all available data from Optum® Clinformatics® Data Mart and included patients aged 65 and older with a new dispensing of an APM in Optum within 30 days of hospital discharge with an infection diagnosis.

TCS were classified using (1) the 7-category US classification system; (2) a 4-category classification from a recent Cochrane Review largely based on the UK formulary; and (3) the 4-category ATC classification. To facilitate comparisons, we consolidated the 7-category US classification system into 4 categories and computed Cohen's weighted kappa (kw) to assess agreement. We assessed correlation between the systems (without consolidating the 7-category classification) using Spearman rank correlation coefficients (rs).",1.0,disease,True

Conclusions: We used multiple resources to classify TCS into three potency classifications. Our findings demonstrate that while correlated, the systems are often incongruent and could yield different results in pharmacoepidemiologic studies. We offer a comprehensive list of TCS potency classifications to support future research; investigators should leverage this resource to contribute robust evidence on the use of TCS, be transparent in their classification approach, and consider alternative potency definitions in sensitivity analyzes.""",0.0,,False

Results: Following the investigative initiative, we observed no change in prescribing patterns for patients with chronic pain; conversely, among acute and postsurgical pain patients, we observed immediate declines in mean daily MME (acute: À0.70 [95% CI: À1.33, À0.07]; postsurgical: À2.39 [95% CI: À3.44, À1.34] mean daily MME). Postlegislation, prescription rates did not decline for those with acute, postsurgical, and non-cancer pain, but instead declined among cancer patients with chronic pain (À12.18 [95% CI: À24.03, À0.33] per 10 000 person months). We observed modest trend declines in mean days' supply for acute and postsurgical pain, but greater declines for chronic pain (À7.25 [95% CI: À9.29, À5.21] days' supply per year). Conclusions: We found mixed evidence on the potential impact of two statewide opioid prescribing policies. Some prescribing indicators declined after the policy while others did not; where observed, declines were most often in a group not intended to be impacted by the policy.

Objectives: To identify and quantify common drug combinations at a drug compound level in first-time metformin users with polypharmacy in the UK, stratified by sex and age. Methods: New users of metformin aged 18+ were identified from the IQVIA Medical Research Data incorporating data from THIN, A Cegedim Database of anonymized electronic health records (2016-2019). Patients with gestational diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, or insulin therapy were excluded.

There is a bidirectional association between depression and T2DM, with polypharmacy common in comorbid individuals; however, the impact of polypharmacy on antidepressant use in individuals with T2DM is unknown. Objectives: In adults with T2DM, we aimed to investigate the association between the number of prescribed medications and early antidepressant discontinuation (duration <32 weeks), specifically: (i) discontinuation of antidepressants altogether; and (ii) switching antidepressant agents.

Conclusions: Early discontinuation of antidepressants is common in adults with T2DM. However, individuals who received more concurrent prescriptions at the start of antidepressant treatment may be more adherent to antidepressant treatment.

However, the risk of delirium after UR treatment has not been well established. Objectives: To assess the association between UR treatment and risk of delirium in patients with BPH. Methods: We conducted a self-controlled cased series (SCCS) study using Taiwan's National Healthcare Insurance Database (NHID). The pre-specified study period started from 2012 to 2018. We included elderly patients aged 65+ years at 2012 newly diagnosed with BPH and received BPH drugs, including alpha blockers (AB) and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARI), and an incident event of delirium during study period. The incident delirium was defined as those without a record before 2012. We classified all observed time into pre-exposure, early exposure, exposure, post-exposure, and non-exposure period. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% CIs were estimated to compare the risk of delirium within each period with unexposed period using conditional Poisson regression model. Results: A total of 16 927 patients were identified. Compared to the non-exposure period, the IRR of delirium was 12.82 (95% CI: 11.94, 13.77), 3.45 (95% CI: 3.03, 3.92), 2.94 (95% CI 2.81, 3.07), 3.63 (95% CI 3.35, 3.93) for pre-exposure, early exposure, exposure, post exposure period, respectively.

Objectives: To investigate the association between polypharmacy status and trajectories of HRQoL in older adults. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study of 2181 community-dwelling adults, 65 years and older, who participated in the 2013 to 2017 waves of the Household Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. Polypharmacy was defined as the regular use of 5 prescription medications. Polypharmacy status was categorized into no polypharmacy, in 2013 only (baseline only polypharmacy), in 2017 only (incident polypharmacy) or at both time points (persistent polypharmacy). HRQoL was assessed through the SF-36 questionnaire generating two summary scores: physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). Linear mixed-effects models stratified according to polypharmacy status and change in comorbidities were used to assess trajectories of HRQoL. Results: Older adults with persistent polypharmacy had lowest scores for HRQoL measures in 2013 and 2017. After adjusting for all covariates, those with incident polypharmacy had the steepest annual decline in both the PCS and MCS: À0.86 in PCS and À0.76 in MCS for those with decreasing or stable comorbidities, and À1.20 in PCS and À0.75 in MCS for those with increasing comorbidities. Over the 4-year study period, this equated to a decline of À3.44 in PCS and À3.04 in MCS for those with incident polypharmacy with decreasing or stable comorbidities, and À4.8 in PCS and À3.0 in MCS for those with incident polypharmacy with increasing comorbidities. Conclusions: Polypharmacy was associated with poorer HRQoL, even after adjusting for confounders. Incident polypharmacy was found to be associated with a clinically important decline in HRQoL and this should be considered when prescribing additional medication to older adults.",1.0,community,True

Other characteristics could be used to classify polypharmacy into subgroups with varying levels of risk. Objectives: To characterize different types of polypharmacy among older adults in the province of Quebec, Canada. Methods: Using healthcare databases from the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System, we selected a community-based random sample of 110 000 Quebecers aged 66 years and older on March 3first, 2017. Only those who were covered by the Public Drug Insurance Plan were included. Categorical indicators used to describe polypharmacy were evaluated over a 6-month period (October first, 2016 to March 3first, 2017) and consisted of: (1) number of medications, (2) potentially inappropriate medications (PIM), (3) drug interactions, (4) high-alert medications, (5) anticholinergic burden score (ABS), (6) use of blister cards, and (7) administration complexity (i.e., different routes of administration). Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to subdivide polypharmacy into groups. Models ranging from 1 to 7 classes were tested. Choice of the final model was based on fit statistics, parsimony, and interpretability. Results: In total, 93 516 individuals were included. Participants were on average 75.5 (±7.1) years old and took 6.4 (±4.7) medications. Nearly half (52.7%) had at least one PIM, one drug interaction or one high-alert medication. Mean ABS was 0.9 (±1.5). One third (33.6%) had at least one complex route of administration and 15.7% used blister cards. A 4-class model was selected, based on statistical criteria and clinical interpretability. Entropy was 0.77. The groups can be described as: (1) High-medium number of medication, low risk (33.5% of population share), (2) Medium number of medication, PIM use ± high ABS (8.1%), (3) No polypharmacy (45.7%) and (4) Hyperpolypharmacy, complex use, high risk (12.8%). However, tested models had continuously decreasing fit indices (BIC, AIC, SABIC) and relatively low entropy (<0.80), making the choice of model more arbitrary and compromising classification's validity.

Literature suggests that PIMs exposure is higher among Nursing Home Residents (NHRs) than among Community-Dwelling Older Adults (CDOAs). However, very few studies have compared exposure to PIMs controlling for demographic and health status differences between these two populations. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of PIMs between NHRs and CDOAs from French health insurance data. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted over a 3-month period in 2019 using the French National Healthcare Database (SNDS). The study population included 274 971 NHRs and 4 893 721 CDOAs aged between 75 and 110 years. We described the prevalence of seventeen PIM indicators, based on the Beers and STOPP 2015 lists. The Prevalence Ratio (PR) of PIMs between NHRs and CDOAs was assessed using robust Poisson regression models adjusted for age, sex, diseases, and polypharmacy. Results: NHRs were older (89.2 ± 5.9 versus 82.5 ± 5.4 years) and more frequently female (79.1% versus 59.9%) than CDOAs. During the study period, 54% of NHRs and 29% of CDOAs received at least one PIM. After adjustment for confounders, the prevalence of PIMs was 33% higher among NHRs compared to CDOAs (aPR [95% CI] ,""1.33 [1.33-1.34]). Compared to CDOAs, NHRs received PIMs related to benzodiazepines (aPR [95% CI]"",""1.43 [1.42-1.43]), anticholinergic drugs (aPR [95% CI]"",""1.29 [1.27-1.31]), and at least three central nervous system-active drugs (aPR [95% CI]"",1.94 [1.92-1.96]) more frequently.

Conclusions: This large study from the French National Healthcare Database confirms that NHRs are at greater risk for PIM overall than CDOAs, although this is not true for a few PIM indicators. As the population is aging, it is essential to promote and evaluate interventions in NHs and in the community to enhance medication optimization.""",1.0,Community,True

Hypertension in the mid to late-life is associated with an increased risk of incident dementia and whether there are changes in prescribing patterns of blood pressure-lowering drugs with regards to a patient's dementia diagnosis is unclear. Objectives: The objective of the study is to evaluate whether there are changes in prescribing trends of blood pressure-lowering drugs before and after incident dementia diagnosis in Hong Kong. Methods: This is a population-based study using electronic health data from Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS), a territory-wide medical database in Hong Kong. The target population were those aged 40 years or older diagnosed with dementia from 2004-2019. A time series analysis was conducted to compare the monthly proportion of patients prescribed with blood pressurelowering drugs 3 years before and after incident dementia diagnosis using a segmented autoregressive error model. Eligible patients had a hypertension diagnosis and a blood pressure-lowering drug prescription before time series entry. Secondary outcomes were healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and uncontrolled blood pressure (UBP). Subgroup analysis was conducted by dividing patients into different comorbidity burdens based on Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI): 0-3, 4-7 and 8+. Results: The study included 31 873 patients with dementia in 2004- 2019. The mean age at incident dementia diagnosis was 84.09 years old (Standard Deviation: 7.84). There was a decreasing prescribing trend of blood pressure-lowering drugs 3 years before dementia diagnosis, a sharp increase shortly after dementia diagnosis, then a greater decreasing trend in the 3 years after dementia compared to predementia (Pre-dementia slope: À0.17, Level change: 4.66, Slope change: À0.30, all p-value <0.01). For HRU, there was an increasing pre-dementia slope, a sharp increase shortly after dementia, then a gradual decreasing trend. For UBP, there was a decreasing predementia slope, a decrease shortly after dementia, then a nonsignificant decreasing trend. The 0-3 and 4-7 CCI subgroups followed similar trends to the main analysis. The 8+ CCI group had a greater decreasing prescribing trend after dementia and higher overall HRU throughout the time series. Conclusions: Patients with prior hypertension received increased medical care immediately after their first dementia diagnosis in Hong Kong. As their condition was better managed, the proportion of patients with uncontrolled blood pressure decreased, while prescribing and healthcare utilization in the 3 years after dementia diagnosis gradually decreased.

3207,"Background: Hip fracture is a major traumatic event that often requires pain management with opioid therapy. Following hip fracture hospitalization, older adults commonly receive post-acute care (PAC) in Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs), Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRFs) and Long Term Acute Care Hospitals (LTACHs) to rehabilitate and eventually discontinue opioid use before returning home. Little is known about continued opioid use after PAC and whether setting is related to whether patients become long-term opioid users. Objectives: To assess whether any and long-term opioid use following discharge from PAC after hip fracture varies by PAC setting across SNFs, IRFs and LTACHs. Methods: We assessed any opioid dispensing and long-term use of opioids among Medicare beneficiaries aged >66 years with a hip fracture hospitalization followed by PAC in a SNF, IRF or LTACH between 2012 and 2018. Patients were followed from PAC discharge for up to one year or until censoring due to re-fracture, re-entering PAC, Medicare disenrollment, or death. Long-term opioid use was defined as an episode of 90 or more days of continuous use with gaps of no more than 30 days. Fine and Gray proportional subdistribution hazards regression models were used to estimate the risk of any post-PAC opioid dispensing and becoming a longterm opioid user following discharge from each PAC setting. Analyzes were adjusted for age, sex, race, year, Combined Comorbidity Index, days in PAC and the competing risk of death. Results: We included 513 497 patients discharged from PAC (76% SNFs, 24% IRFs, 0.4% LTACHs). SNF patients were older on average, while LTACH patients had more comorbidities and longer PAC stays. Opioids were dispensed to 89 591 (17%) patients following PAC discharge and the unadjusted one-year cumulative incidence was notably higher in SNF patients (21.3%) than IRF (18.8%) or LTACH (18.4%). LTACH patients had a significantly reduced hazard of post-PAC opioid use (Hazard Ratio (HR): 0.794 [95% CL 0.705, 0.894]) compared to IRF. There was no significant difference in long-term opioid use between LTACH and IRF (HR: 1.038 [95% CL 0.828, 1.302]). SNF patients had a significantly increased hazard of post-PAC opioid use (HR: 1.208 [95% CL 1.188, 1.229]) and of long-term opioid use (HR: 1.473 [95% CL 1.414, 1.535]), compared to IRF. Conclusions: Opioid use is common upon discharge from PAC after hip fracture. Further research is needed to assess the effects of post-PAC opioid use and how management during PAC can be modified to reduce the need for continued opioid use after discharge home.",1.0,,True

Objectives: To evaluate the application of joint latent class models (JLCM) in identifying trajectories of frailty progression over time and risk of death in older people using routinely collected data. Methods: Patients identified from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD database linked to Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics mortality register aged 65 on December 3first 2009 were included. eFI scores were calculated at baseline (2009) and annually in subsequent years (2010-2013). JLCM include the longitudinal and time-to-event sub-models. It uses latent class modeling to divide the population into subgroups (clusters) with different average intercepts and slopes. The model then calculates the mortality risk of each cluster. Two- to six- cluster models were fitted. To determine the best model (i.e., number of clusters), Bayesian Inference Criterion (BIC) was used. Models were adjusted for baseline age and gender. Intercepts and slopes, baseline characteristics, and mortality hazard ratios (HR) of the identified clusters were reported. Results: The 5-cluster model was chosen based on BIC and 475 503 patients were included.

Subsequent data processing, creating the analysis datasets, performing the statistical analyzes and producing results, may also benefit from harmonization and streamlining. Objectives: To develop and implement a lean and flexible data model and a lightweight framework of modular analytics programs that can be used for pharmacoepidemiological studies. Methods: The framework is currently implemented in SAS and based on a Nordic Common Data Model (NCDM) with added analytic metadata containing 1) a specification of study parameters, 2) a concept dictionary defining the mapping of codes (for diagnoses, procedures, etc.) to concepts and 3) a variable dictionary defining variables in the analytic dataset based on concepts and time windows. A prerequisite for using the framework is an initial extract-transform-load step where data are structured in person-time-event datasets corresponding to residence episodes, clinical events (healthcare encounters, cancer and death records with diagnosis and procedure codes), drug events (pharmacy dispensings), and lab events (laboratory measurements). The data model can be extended with ad hoc person-time-event datasets (e.g., vaccinations). Modular programs are designed to run in a logical sequence. First, codes from different systems are translated into broader concepts. Second, the study population is selected, identifying exposed persons and comparators, applying inclusion and exclusion criteria and sampling controls if relevant. Finally, the analysis dataset is created, applying metadata definitions of confounder variables, criteria for follow-up, outcome events and censoring.

Objectives: To evaluate the use of ML to automate extraction of data from studies included in two SLRs, including randomized controlled trials in oncology (SLR 1) and observational studies in Fabry disease (SLR 2). Methods: Using web-based tools, we annotated documents with terms of interest (entities) and relationships between them (relations). Articles identified from SLR 1 and SLR 2 were annotated alongside a larger set of similar articles. The process was two-stage: entity extraction - identification of entities; relation extraction - classification of entity relations. Several models were trained and tested in their ability to identify entities and their relations vs human annotation, and the results compared. For entity extraction: BERT + CRF labels words in the context of neighboring words. For relation extraction: BERT + Relation Classification, identifies relations between a pair of entities based on their location. BERT is pre-trained on general language text, so using biomedical literature, we also fine-tuned BERT to learn context-rich word representations. Performance was measured using relaxed F1 scores, a measure of specificity and sensitivity. We defined successful matches as partial overlap of entities of the same type.

3228,"Background: While early readmission and death after hospitalization for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (ECOPD) are important adverse outcomes for both patients and society, prior studies found inconsistent risk factors and moderate prediction ability. Objectives: To examine the ability of machine learning approaches on predicting early readmission and death after ECOPD hospitalization. Methods: We used Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to identify ECOPD hospitalizations between 2015 and 2019. All hospitalizations were split into the development dataset (discharged between 2015 and 2018) and the validation dataset (discharged in 2019). Predictors were collected during the previous year and the index hospitalization, including patient characteristics, administrative health data, individuals' linked laboratory tests, and environmental data. Prediction on 30-day readmission and death were derived in the development dataset using lasso regression, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and neural network, with LACE index as the reference. Calibration plots and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were evaluated based on the validation dataset. The top predictors were identified using in-built methods. Results: There were 101 011 hospitalizations included in the development dataset and 17 565 in the validation dataset. The 30-day readmission rate was 29.1% and the 30-day mortality rate was 4.3% after ECOPD hospitalization. In the validation dataset, the best machine learning model (XGBoost) had an area under ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.721 (95% CI, 0.713-0.729) for 30-day readmission and an AUROC of 0.809 (95% CI, 0.794-0.824) for 30-day death, which were both significantly higher than the corresponding value for LACE index (0.651 and 0.641, respectively).

3235,"Background: Electronic health record (EHR) discontinuity, i.e., receiving care outside of a given EHR system, has been shown to cause substantial misclassification in commonly used clinical risk scores. A prediction model was previously developed to identify patients with high EHR-continuity, but the impact of this algorithm on the prediction performance of these scores when predicting clinical outcomes is unknown. Objectives: To assess the performance of commonly used clinical risk scores when predicting clinical endpoints in patients with high vs. low predicted EHR-continuity. Methods: The study cohort was patients aged  65 years identified in a US multi-center EHR linked with Medicare claims data (2007/1/1- 2017/12/31). Included subjects were required to have 365-day Medicare (Parts A, B, D) continuous enrollment, with at least one overlapping encounter in the study EHR. The index date was defined by the date at which these two criteria were met. Four risk scores were calculated based on covariates assessed in 365 days prior to the index date using EHR data alone (subject to misclassification due to EHRdiscontinuity). We examined the performance of 1) combined comorbidity score (CCS) predicting death 2) claim-based frailty score (CFI)predicting death 3) CHAD2DS2-VASc predicting ischemic stroke 4) HAS-BLED predicting bleeding using logistic regression. All the clinical endpoint (death, stroke, and bleeding risks) were evaluated in the linked EHR-claims data (not subject to misclassification due to EHRdiscontinuity) in one year following the index date. We compared prediction performance of risk scores based on Area under the ROC curve (AUC), stratified by four levels of EHR-continuity score with cut-off informed by the literature (low: <0.055, low-intermediate: 0.055-0.218, intermediate: 0.218-0.371, high: 0.371). Results: The study cohort included 319 740 patients (42 066 atrial fibrillation patients for CHAD2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores). Using CCS based on EHR alone to predict one-year risk of death, the AUC was 0.562 in the lowest EHR-continuity level and increased to 0.838 in the highest EHR-continuity level.

Conclusions: Using EHR data only, the prediction performance of risk scores is substantially worse in patients with low predicted EHRcontinuity vs. those with high predicted EHR-continuity.

3248,"Background: Ascertainment of mortality is critical to many noninterventional studies but is challenging due to the lack of systematic recording of mortality data in health claims or electronic medical records. The National Death Index (NDI) is considered a gold standard for mortality ascertainment in the US. However, linking real-world data sources to NDI data often involves considerable time and resources, and privacy restrictions prevent linkage to NDI data for some populations. While alternative sources may be used, their performance may vary over time. Objectives: To investigate time trends in the performance of death data from the Social Security Death Master File (DMF), hospital discharge codes, health plan disenrollment, obituaries, and other sources compared to the NDI in the HealthCore Integrated Research DatabaseSM (HIRD). Methods: This study is a secondary analysis of de-identified data originating from a standing cohort of individuals in the US with advanced cancer with an established NDI linkage in HIRD from January 2010 to December 2018. NDI early release data was obtained for 2018 and may not be complete. Mortality data sources, including inpatient discharge status, health plan disenrollment, DMF, and online obituary data, all updated monthly in the HIRD, were compared to the NDI. Death status from each source and the NDI was used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each year of the study. Results: We identified death dates for 27 396 of 40 692 advanced cancer patients from 2010 to 2018 (NDI: 25 761; alternate sources: 24 612; overlap: 22 977). The sensitivity for the DMF declined from 0.77 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.79) in 2010 to 0.13 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.14) in 2018.

3250,"Background: Real-world data (RWD) capture mortality in different ways. Some RWD only capture mortality within its data generation processes (e.g. disenrollment due to death/in-hospital death), while other RWD use external sources to supplement death information that occurs outside of the database (e.g. linkage of electronic health records (EHR) to Social Security Death Index). Accuracy of such mortality information varies by RWD source and is never 100% complete. There are conflicting recommendations for censoring overall survival (OS) in RWD. Objectives: We present a simulation study to evaluate the impact of censoring schemes on estimates of median survival time and hazard ratios under conditions of incomplete mortality information. Methods: Survival data was simulated to represent a real-world EHR database. OS was assumed to follow an exponential distribution with median OS time of 1.5 and 3 years for the control and treatment groups, respectively. The maximum follow up was truncated at 5 years, corresponding to ~25% of patients censored at 5 years. Last activity was correlated with death when death occurred within the EHR system, with median time from last activity to death being 14 days. The capture of linked mortality information was varied from 0% to 95% incomplete. 1000 simulated datasets were generated with 200 patients assigned in 1:1 ratio to the treatment and control groups. Two censoring schemes typically recommended were evaluated: (1) censor at last activity date in absence of an observed death, and (2) censor at maximum follow up date. Median OS times and hazard ratios were estimated in each dataset. Bias and coverage were used to measure performance of each censoring scheme under varying amounts of incomplete mortality information. Results: Our simulations demonstrate censoring at last activity is most biased when linked mortality information is well captured. Estimates of median survival were biased down indicating shorter estimated survival compared to the true parameter (mean bias in years (control, treatment) when 0% incomplete: -.04, -.25; when 95% incomplete: -.005,-.03). Estimates of hazard ratios were biased upwards indicating a smaller effect than the true effect, however less impact was seen (mean bias in log HR when 0% incomplete: .03; when 95% incomplete: .0004).

3279,"Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the neurological disease whose prevalence has increased most, and currently available treatments are only partially or transiently effective. Neuroprotective drugs are needed and a promising strategy is to identify existing molecules that may present a therapeutic or even preventive advantage for PD (drug repositioning). Objectives: We aimed at detecting drugs that are potentially protective for PD, using a large-scale automated screening strategy. Methods: We implemented a machine learning (ML) algorithm combining subsampling and lasso logistic regression in a case-control study nested in the French national healthcare database. Our study population consisted of 40 760 incident cases identified by a validated algorithm in 2016-2018, and 176 395 controls of similar age and sex, both followed since 2006. Drug exposure was defined by the penultimate level of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification considering the frequency of prescriptions over a two-year period starting ten years before the date of PD to account for the potential for reverse causation. Sensitivity analyzes were conducted considering an exposure period of five years and the finest substance level of the ATC classification. Models were adjusted for a wide range of covariates available in the database (chronic diseases, reasons for hospitalizations, medical consultations, biological procedures, deprivation and rurality indices). Results: Six drug subgroups were detected by our algorithm among the 374 screened. Sulfonamides (ATC C03CA), in particular furosemide (C03CA01), showed the most robust signal. Other signals included adrenergics in combination with anticholinergics for obstructive airways diseases (R03AL), and insulins and analogs (A10AD).",1.0,disease,True

3283,"Background: All services should exist for customers, and understanding customer needs is essential. Customer journey maps are commonly used to visualize their experiences in the marketing field. Following this system, it is quite meaningful to have a tool for patients in the healthcare field to help understanding emotional distress with treatment and making a solution for it. Therefore, we attempted to develop a patient journey map (PJM) that visualizes patients' actual experiences, and this is expected to promote the provision of patientcentric solutions. Objectives: To develop the PJM for visualizing a patient journey using disease blogs obtained from the Internet and identifying unsatisfactory events for patients by applying natural language processing (NLP) technique. Methods: Using NLP and graph database theory approach, we first tried to visualize medical paths. For medical terms that appear multiple times (e.g., hospital admission), we adopted only the first appearance of each term as a node. In order to evaluate the validity of our approach, we calculated the patient satisfaction index (PSI) of sentences, which contain the term using the prediction model presented previously (Matsuda, et al.

Results: We analyzed 48 disease blogs written by patients with breast cancer (20-34 years old: n ,"" 10, 35-49 years old: n "","" 30, 50- 64 years old: n "","" 8). Using the PJM, we succeeded in visualizing a series of patient's treatment experiences as a path, which consists of each treatment experience as a node, and the path lined up in a chronological order.

The risk of muscle-related adverse events may be significantly increased when an interactive drug is added to the treatment of patients taking statins. Previous studies have reported that potential Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) may increase the risk of statin-related myopathy, and several drug are included as contraindicated to prescribed with statins in Korean national drug utilization review (DUR) system. However, there have been no studies focusing on contraindication conducted using the Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management-Korea adverse event reporting system database (KIDS-KD). Objectives: To assess patterns of spontaneous reporting of myopathy following combined use of statin-contraindicated drugs, compared with reports of non-myopathy. Methods: Among the individual cases safety reports (ICSRs) reported to the KIDS-KD from 2016 to 2020, the drug of interest was a statin and the selection criteria were statin classified as C10AA HMG CoA reductase inhibitors according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System code (out of 8 types of detailed component name classification, 7 types of domestically marketed drugs). The combinations of statin and contraindicated drug were extracted from DUR criteria in Korea. We defined myopathy cases using `Myopathy' and `Rhabdomyolysis' among MedDRA SMQ terms, and matched appropriate WHO-ART code in which AE terms are recorded in the database.

3294,"Background: Recent case reports suggested that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may interact with statins via pharmacokinetic mechanisms, thereby increasing the risk of statin-induced myotoxicity. Given the common use of both drug classes in patients with cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome, further evidence is needed to understand this potential interaction. Objectives: To assess the risk of myotoxicity reporting associated with concomitant use of SGLT2 inhibitors and statins. Methods: We queried the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from 2013 to 2021 for reports including SGLT2 inhibitors, statins, or both. The study outcomes were myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, defined using preferred terms from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. We assessed several measures of disproportionality for the reporting of the study outcomes associated with concomitant use of SGLT2 inhibitors and statins. We estimated an additive interaction in a linear model (assuming a safety signal when the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval [CI] >0) and a multiplicative interaction using a logistic model to generate reporting odds ratios (RORs) (assuming a safety signal when the lower bound of the 95% CI of the ROR>1). We also computed the 0 shrinkage measure, a method recommended by the WHO for drugdrug interaction (DDI) signal detection (assuming a safety signal when 0025>0), and the concomitant signal score (CSS), a method that extends the proportional reporting ratio to the DDI setting considering two criteria in the assessment of concomitant signal detection (assuming a safety signal when both CSS criteria are met). In sensitivity analyzes, we adjusted for age and sex, and focused on canagliflozin and rosuvastatin, the SGLT2 inhibitor-statin pair with the strongest pharmacological rationale for a DDI. Results: There were 428 myopathy and 69 rhabdomyolysis reports involving both an SGLT2 inhibitor and a statin in FAERS during the 9-year study period.

Objectives: To assess whether concomitant use of sulfonylureas and beta-blockers is associated with an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia compared to the use of sulfonylureas alone, and to assess the role of cardioselectivity of beta-blockers in this association. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the United Kingdom's Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to hospitalization and vital statistics data. We included patients initiating sulfonylurea treatment between April 1998 and June 2020. Patients with use of beta-blockers in the 6 months prior to cohort entry were excluded. Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of severe hypoglycemia associated with concomitant use of sulfonylureas and beta-blockers compared to the use of sulfonylureas alone, adjusted for potentials confounders at cohort entry. We assessed the role of cardioselectivity by comparing current concomitant use of sulfonylureas and noncardioselective beta-blockers to current concomitant use of sulfonylureas and cardioselective beta-blockers. Sensitivity analyzes addressed different potential sources of bias including exposure misclassification (by using alternate grace periods), outcome misclassification (by using a stricter outcome definition), and residual confounding (by using concomitant use of sulfonylureas and thiazide diuretics as active comparator). Results: A total of 252 869 patients initiated sulfonylurea treatment during the study period.

Methods: We conducted a cohort study using the UK primary care Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD, 2000-2019). We identified patients with an incident diagnosis of depression (exposed cohort)). For each exposed patient, we identified one comparison patient of the same age and sex without a diagnosis of depression prior to the cohort entry date (CED) of the corresponding exposed patient. Comparison patients had to have 1GP visit within 14 days prior to the CED. We followed patients from day 1 after the CED for a maximum of 2 years or until censoring. The primary outcome was a composite of diagnosed acute infection (respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital, or septicemia). We used fine stratification based on propensity score (PS) to control for 32 baseline covariates including lifestyle factors, comorbidities, comedications, and health-care utilization.

Methods: Using Danish medical registries, we conducted a nationwide population based cohort study during 1996-2016. Individuals with migraine were identified by redeemed prescriptions for migraine specific medication. Five members matched on age, sex, and calendar year from the general population were selected for each migraine patient. We calculated the cumulative incidence with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for 21-years of follow-up as a measure of the absolute risk (AR) of premature stroke and MI for women and men with and without migraine. We used Cox regression to compute hazard ratios (HR) adjusted for age, calendar period, and comorbidities comparing individuals with migraine to those without of the same sex. Results: We identified 198 542 individuals with migraine (82% female). AR of premature MI was 1.2% (95% CI: 1.1-1.3) for women without migraine and 1.6% (95% CI: 1.3-1.8) for women with migraine.

Rates from Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales were considered as three separate interventions, with different dates as per official date of mandate publication/s. Data from England was used as the counterfactual, as no passport mandates were imposed until late December.

Poor oral health may have a profound effect on general health as well as the quality of life, and some oral diseases are closely related to chronic diseases. However, the treatment of oral disease for oral health conditions is expensive because of the high prevalence and recurrent cumulative nature. Thus, oral health care and prevention of disease is an important issue for individual and public health. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the annual changes in the age-standardized incidence rate of oral diseases, dental caries and pulpitis, gingivitis and periodontitis, and tooth loss and identify the risk factors in Korea. Methods: National Health Insurance Service - National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) and Health Screening cohort (NHIS-HEALS) were used. We selected individuals who had not been diagnosed or treated for oral diseases between 2002 and 2005. The agestandardization incidence rate of oral disease was performed using 2005 population projections for Korea as a standard population. Annual percent changes (APC) of the incidence rate from 2006 to 2015 were assessed using joinpoint regression analysis. Associations between risk factors and each oral disease were evaluated by Cox proportional hazard model. Subsequently, the marginal model was used to evaluate the comprehensive effects of risk factors on all oral diseases. Results: Decreasing trends were observed in dental caries and pulpitis (APC,""-5.49 and À4.17 in NHIS-NSC and HEALS, respectively) and tooth loss (APC"",""-4.96 and À1.41), whereas an increasing trend existed in gingivitis and periodontitis (APC "","" 8.66 and 9.13) between 2006 and 2015.

3325,"Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is often considered for patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD), as recommended by guidelines from several countries. However, previous studies have shown inconsistent results regarding the response to ECT in patients with TRD. Objectives: To assess and compare the response rate of ECT for patients with TRD to that of other patients with depression (i.e. nonTRD) in a large and clinically representative patient sample. We hypothesized that patients with TRD would have a lower ECT response rate than other patients with depression. Methods: Patients 18 years old, treated for a unipolar, non-psychotic depressive episode with at least one ECT session as part of a first-time, index ECT series between Jan. 1 2011 and Dec. 31 2017 were identified from the Swedish National Quality Register for ECT, and individually linked with other population-based registers. Patients with any lifetime diagnosis of bipolar disorder, manic or hypomanic episode, psychotic disorder, or dementia as well as those lacking registration of the primary outcome measure were excluded. Using the Prescribed Drug Register, we classified patients as having TRD if they had initiated a third consecutive trial of antidepressants or add-on medications before starting ECT. Remaining patients were considered to have other depression. The main outcome measure was response to ECT according to the Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement scale (CGI-I) assessed within a week after the ECT series, defined as a CGI-I assessment of `much' or `very much improved'. Outcome measures were compared between patients with TRD and with other depression using logistic regression to calculate odds ratios of response and corresponding confidence intervals, adjusting for potential confounders including sociodemographic and clinical covariates. Results: A total of 4244 patients were included. Of these, 1121 patients were classified as TRD (61.2% female, mean age 51.4 years) and 3123 (54.3 % female, mean age 50.4 years) patients had other depression. The CGI-I response rate after ECT among patients with TRD was 65.9% compared to 75.9% in other patients with depression (adjusted odds ratio 0.64 [95% CI 0.54-0.75]). Conclusions: A clear majority of patients with TRD as well as patients with other depression responded to ECT, although the response rate was lower in TRD.",1.0,clinical,True

3331,"Background: While benzodiazepines (BDZ) are effective as anxiolytic drug, BDZ is also known to cause more dangerous adverse events (AEs) in long-acting BDZ. Objectives: To compare patterns of AE reports including long-acting BDZ with short-acting BDZ. Methods: Among the Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) reported to the Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management-Korea adverse event reporting system database (KIDS-KD) between 2016 and 2020, ICSRs containing BDZ drugs were selected. BDZ were categorized into two groups (long-acting and short-acting) based on their elimination half-life. Drugs that has a longer half-life (24 h) were considered long-acting BDZ and those with a shorter half-life (<24 h) were considered short-acting BDZ. Suspected AEs were coded with the WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology (WHO-ART) codes - Preferred Term (PT). For comparing patterns of reported AEs, we adopted the criteria of signal detection: PRR (PRR2, cases>2, chi-square4), ROR (ROR2, cases>2, chi-square4) and IC (IC_low>0). For the AEs that showing significance, we reviewed literatures and label information. Results: Among total of 3 722 851 ICSRs in KIDS-KD, the number of ICSRs for long-acting BDZ users was 10 920 (0.29%) and short-acting BDZ users was 25 596 (0.69%). Reports for average of age in longacting BDZ users and short-acting BDZ users were 59 and 60 years old. The number of aged over 65 years old for long-acting BDZ and short-acting BDZ was 4229(0.11%) and 9665(0.26%), respectively. Cramps legs (PRR, 6.25), delusion (PRR, 3.13), dementia (PRR, 3.32), gait abnormal (PRR, 2.9), hypotonia (PRR, 2.75), malaise (PRR, 2.04) and vertigo (PRR, 2.41) were significantly reported higher in long-acting BDZ. Conclusions: We confirmed that AEs including cognitive impairment and ataxia showed higher reporting ratios in long-acting BDZ compared with short-acting BDZ.

3335,"Methods: This is a cohort study using two different data sources, ANMCO, a prospective registry of patients with HF who visited participating cardiology centers in Italy, and BIG-PAC, a database combining healthcare data from various primary and hospital centers in Spain. Patients with HF in ANMCO (new and prevalent patients) between January 2010 and December 2018, and in BIG-PAC (new patients only) between January 2012 and September 2020 were classified into HFrEF (<40%), HFmrEF (40%-49%) and HFpEF (50%) and HFuEF (no EF record) based on their LVEF at index (according to ESC 2016 guideline). Patients without a second LVEF assessment during follow-up were excluded from the analysis. The proportion of HF phenotypes was reported for each assessment together with the transition among LVEF categories. Results: The study included 5304 and 12 498 eligible patients in ANMCO and BIG-PAC. At baseline (first diagnosis in BIG-PAC and enrolment date in ANMCO), HFrEF represented about 58% of HF patients in ANMCO [3096/5304] and 62% in BIG-PAC [7798/12 498]). At the next measurement, 69% (2146/3096), 60% (764/1269) and 84% (792/939) of patients with HFrEF, HFmrEF and HFpEF stayed in the same class in ANMCO while in BIG-PAC were 59% (4638/7798), 41% (362/885) and 55% (2089/3815) first and second categories agreed. About 31% (950/3096) and 41% (3160/7798) of HFrEF patients in ANMCO and BIG-PAC had a higher EF at the second measurement (HFrEF with improved EF) and about 23% of HFmrEF patients improve EF to 50% in both databases. Overall, 24% and 27% of patients show an increase in EF at the second measurement. In ANMCO, more patients with HFmrEF had an EF > 50% at second measurement than EF <40 (23% vs 17%), while in BIG-PAC the trend was the opposite (23% vs 36% HFmrEF to HFrEF). Among all patients, 7% (358/5304) and 17% (2132/12 498) in ANMCO and BIG-PAC had a lower EF at second measurement sufficient to change category. The proportion of patients with EF >,""50% increased in ANMCO: 18% to 26%, but decreased in BIG-PAC: from 31% to 26%, with 21% of initial HFpEF patients having an EF <40% at follow-up. Conclusions: The proportion of HF phenotypes determined at second EF measurement are very similar in Italy and Spain. While about one quarter of patients shows an improvement in EF in both databases, the Italian Registry registry data shows fewer phenotype transitions overall owing, perhaps, to a population with more mature disease.""",1.0,disease,True

3343,"Objectives: Develop SEIRS long term forecast model using country specific data that predicts the waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in 45 countries. Methods: Daily mortality data from Our World In Data were used to estimate the number of COVID-19 infections. Age-adjusted infection fatality rate (IFR) was derived from population based analyzes in Iceland, where near total population testing occurred. The reproduction number (R0) came from fitting mortality curve and adjusted for: date, pre- and infectious periods, immunity duration by disease severity/vaccination status, vaccine efficacy/availability and uptake by age. The model incorporated historical data, scientific publications, and media reports. Adjusted daily mortality included fixed variables with R0 variation over time. Hospitalizations, ICU admissions and mortality were forecasted over one year for each country. Forecast accuracy was assessed quarterly once historical data were available. Results: Before vaccines, R0 was affected by immunity duration, transmissibility and non-pharmaceutical interventions. In 2021, vaccination increased the model complexity, and was updated to estimate the susceptibility pool over time by country based on: vaccination/ booster schedule by age, vaccine uptake, efficacy and immunity duration. These factors vary significantly and require country-specific modeling to predict COVID-19 mortality. The forecast accurately modeled COVID-19 short-term and showed surges in the future. By July 2020, the model predicted 29.4 million (M) infections in the US, compared to the 17.1M - 35.1M infections estimated by the US National Institute of Health (NIH) seroprevalence study (based on 4.5M confirmed cases). By the end of 2021, the model showed 254M cumulative infections and 3.63M hospitalizations in the US, compared to 206M - 424M infections reported by NIH and 3.71M hospitalizations reported by Center for Disease Control (CDC). For 2022, the model projected 249M infections/4.2M hospitalizations in the US, and 2.8 billion infections/35.5M hospitalizations worldwide. Conclusions: This SEIRS-based model that integrates country specific data accurately forecasts COVID-19 mortality and demonstrates an emerging persistent state.

3347,"Objectives: We aimed to investigate the incidence, characteristics and its impact on mortality of post-AMI HF in both STEMI and NSTEMI patients. Methods: A nationwide cohort study was conducted using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database from 2014 to 2019. Patients admitted for incident AMI were included. We further captured cases with documented in-hospital HF or post-discharge HF during the 1-year post-AMI follow-up period. The rate and timing of HF occurrence were assessed. Logistic regression and cox proportional hazard models were adopted to examine the impacts of postAMI HF on in-hospital and one-year mortality after discharge from the index AMI event, respectively. Results: A total of 71 489 patients (mean age 66.3 ± 13.2, female 25%) with an incident AMI were identified during 2014 to 2018, in which 9198 (13%) patients developed in-hospital HF. The proportion of patients developed in-hospital HF was higher in NSTEMI patients (16%) as compared to STEMI patients (10%). Of 55 899 patients survived from the index AMI event and discharged without in-hospital HF, 2748 (4%) patients were admitted for HF at 1-year of follow-up and the rate of post-discharge HF was comparable in STEMI and NSTEMI (4%). The incidence of HF after AMI was highest in the first month with a decrease afterward. Female gender, older age and NSTEMI were at higher risk of developing post-AMI HF. Noteworthy, post-discharge HF was associated with an increased risk of 1-year mortality in both STEMI(adjusted HR: 2.45, 95%[CI] 2.12-2.80) and NSTEMI (adjusted HR: 2.35, 95% [CI] 2.152.57) patients. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the proportion of patients developed in-hospital HF was higher in NSTEMI than STEMI patients. As post-AMI HF was associated with increased risk of 1-year mortality, optimizing HF management plan for these patients is crucial.",1.0,case,True

3354,"Background: The prevalence of congenital anomalies of eyes (COA) ranges between 2.4 and 7.5 per 10 000 births. Some have a genetic origin; however most are still unexplained. Research on the impact of prenatal medication exposure on COA genesis is sparse in humans. Several medicines taken during pregnancy are reported to be associated with human COA and around 30 are associated with COA in animal models. Some of these are commonly prescribed to pregnant women. Objectives: The aim of the Medikeye project is (Part 1) to describe COA across Europe, and (Part 2) to investigate any potential associations between first trimester exposure to medication and the occurrence of a COA. The study is ongoing. Part 1 will be presented here. Methods: This study is a European collaboration within the EUROmediCAT network, which brings together 18 population-based registries of congenital anomalies from 13 European countries covering more than 11 million births, 1995-2018. Part 1 is a descriptive study of the ""Eye anomaly subgroup"" defined by the EUROCAT Guide 1.4 according to the international classification ICD-10 (Q10, Q11, Q12, Q13, Q14, and Q15). Minor eye anomalies are excluded. Cases include livebirths, stillbirths, fetal deaths from 20 weeks and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly. Results: We identified 4 433 cases of COA. The prevalence was 3.47/ 10 000 births, and was stable over time . Prevalence ranged from 1.26- 13.74 / 10 000 depending on location of registry. Congenital lens anomalies were the most frequent eye anomalies (30 %), of which over half (54.2%) were isolated. Microphthalmia was the second most frequent eye anomaly (26 %) of which 74.5% were syndromic forms . 22% of liveborn cases have a fetal weight <5th percentile. Known genetic determinants of COA explained only 3 to 25% of COA depending on the type of anomaly. The three ATC classes most frequently prescribed or dispensed to women during the first trimester of pregnancy were B (Blood and blood forming organs), A (Alimentary tract and metabolism), and N (Nervous system). Among women who used medications, the mean [SD] number of medicines per woman was 1.82. Conclusions: This is the first European epidemiological descriptive study reporting COA.

3357,"Background: The Swedish National Health Registers are used for a variety of purposes, including pharmacoepidemiological research due to their large and linkable data. The National Patient Register (NPR) covers information on diseases and medical procedures for the entire Swedish population. The use of NPR to identify cancer risk in safety studies is desired, but NPR has not been validated to date. High completeness of the Swedish Cancer Register (SCR) has been reported, however, its usefulness is limited by its long production time and annual updates. If the consistency of NPR for reporting cancer diagnoses compared to SCR can be shown, it might be widely used in research that requires rapid reporting. Objectives: The overall aim of this study was to evaluate the consistency of NPR for cancer diagnoses as compared to SCR. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with the entire Swedish population as the source population. The study population was patients with at least one cancer registered in SCR between 1 January 2018 and 30 September 2020. The comparison was made between cancer diagnoses identified by the International Classification of Disease 10th version and by the International Classification of Disease for Oncology third version reported in NPR and SCR, respectively. If the same cancer recorded in SCR was found in NPR within +/- 90 days it was considered consistent. Cancer was categorized into 13 classes according to the location of the tumor, excluding lymphoid, hematopoietic, and multiple sites. The frequency of cancers reported in NPR and SCR were compared overall and by category, using SCR as the gold standard. Accuracy measurements including positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), false positive rate (FPR), and false negative rate (FNR) were calculated. Results: In total 223 843 cancer diagnoses in SCR and 124 466 in NPR were identified. The 4 most common cancer types in the registers were skin, digestive organs, male genital organs, and breast. The higher accuracy measurements were observed for breast, male genital organs, and oral cancers (PPV: 87.5-97.4%, sensitivity: 82.2-91.0%, AUC: 0.91-0.95, FPR: 0.18-1.5, FNR: 9.0-17.8).

Conclusions: Consistency of cancer diagnoses in NPR depends on cancer type. The observed high consistency may be explained by the availability of screening. A potential explanation for the lower consistency may be differences in the coding and reporting processes. The mechanisms behind this difference in consistency remain unclear and further investigation is needed.",1.0,disease,True

Objectives: To systematically compare the two diabetes risk assessment tools to explore the factors influencing diabetes risk assessment. Methods: In this prospective study, the study population was exposed to diabetes risk assessment using two diabetes risk assessment tools provided by the American Diabetes Association and The Canadian Diabetes Risk Questionnaire. The study participants were identified as having low or high risk following the diabetes risk test provided by the American Diabetes Association. Whereas, having a high, moderate, or low risk of developing diabetes following The Canadian Diabetes Risk Questionnaire. In addition to common factors in both the tools, additional factors that influence the risk of diabetes mellitus in the study population were also explored. The observations are presented descriptively. Results: A total of 206 individuals were screened for the risk of diabetes mellitus.

Methods: We used NHANES cross-sectional survey data from 2013- 2014 and 2017-2020 (no OP survey in 2015-2016). Eligible participants: adults  40 years for 2013-2014 data and  50 years for 2017-2020 who responded to the survey and had a serum creatinine measure. We determined kidney function by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (CKDEPI) creatinine equation 2021. We defined individuals with moderate to severe CKD as those with eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Prescription and supplement use were based on interviewer review of bottles on hand. All other survey data were self-reported by participants. Results: We identified 7776 eligible participants of whom 51.3% were female and 13.6% had moderate to severe CKD.

However, limited randomized controlled trials assess the comparative effectiveness between PET and surgery. Objectives: The cohort study compared the mortality outcome between surgery and PET in women with breast cancer. Methods: Women aged 50 years with a newly diagnosed, earlystage breast cancer were identified from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (Gold and Aurum) linking to Hospital Episode Statistics, Cancer Registry, and national death registration from 2000 to 2016 in England and followed from the date of diagnosis to death before 2019. In both older (70 years) and younger (50-69 years) groups, propensity scores derived from age (by 5-year intervals), Hospital Risk Frailty Score (3 levels) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (3 levels) and Index of Multiple Deprivation (5 levels), were used to match patients receiving PET or surgery by inverse probability of weight. All-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression, adjusted for the above propensity score as doubly robust estimations, and presented in Hazard Ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: Most women with breast cancer (58 804) were diagnosed at a younger age (61%). The proportion of patients receiving surgery and PET differed between younger (93% vs. 7%) and older groups (70% vs. 30%). The 10-year overall survival was higher in surgery than PET in both younger (29% vs 8%) and older (0.8% vs 0.04%) groups. PET incurred a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality in younger (HR: 2.72; 95% CI: 2.36, 3.14) and older (HR: 2.48; 95% CI: 2.31, 2.67) groups. Likewise, PET has a higher risk of breast cancer specific mortality in younger (HR: 3.27, 95% CI: 2.75, 3.90) and older (HR: 3.62, 95% CI: 3.20, 4.07) groups. Conclusions: Despite the high proportion of PET used in older women with early-stage breast cancer, surgery is superior to PET in reducing mortality for women with early breast cancer, regardless of age. Further research is needed to optimize clinical decisions in allocating frail, unfit for surgery patients to PET.",1.0,trial,True
3374,"Objectives: The objectives of this study were to estimate the annual incidence of dementia and its clinical outcomes in Taiwan from 2004 to 2017. Methods: From Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, people aged 65 years or older and newly diagnosed of dementia, defined as presence of at least three outpatient visit or at least one hospitalization with corresponding diagnosis (ICD-9-CM codes 290, 294, 331.0331.2, 331.82, 331.89, 331.9; ICD-10-CM codes: F01-F04, G30, G31), in each year between 2004 and 2017. Agestandardized overall and sex-stratified annual incidence were reported as estimates per 10 000 person-years at risk. Annual percentage changes (APCs) were tested by joint point regression analysis. Type specific estimates, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia were also reported. For those with incident dementia between 2004 and 2013, we further estimated their annual mortality rates and cause of death during a 5 years of follow-up period. Results: The annual number of incident dementia cases steeply increased by 65% during the study period in Taiwan (from 30 606 in 2004 to 50 651 in 2017), especially in female (+90%). The age-standardized annual incidence of dementia slightly increased from 142.9 per 10 000 people in 2004 to 146.2 per 10 000 people in 2017, with an APC increase of 0.4% [95% CI: 0.1% to 0.8%], p ,"" 0.02). The agestandardized annual incidence of dementia in male remained stable; In contrast, the trend was significantly increased in female (APC: 0.7% [95% CI: 0.2% to 1.1%], p < 0.01). A significant decrease in vascular dementia was observed. The age-standardized annual incidence of vascular dementia was 25.9 per 10 000 people in 2004 but steeply declined to 17.5 per 10 000 people in 2017 (APC À6.1% [95% CI: À7.1% to À5.1%], p < 0.01)). For all identified cases between 2004 and 2013 (n "","" 372 203; age 79.3 ± 7.3 years, 53.2% female), the annual mortality was approximately 12% during study period.

3384,"Background: The exact cause of diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains unknown. Studies have suggested a clinical rationale for subgrouping T2D into 3 phenotypes of either insulinopenic (high insulin sensitivity, low beta-cell function), classical (low insulin sensitivity, low beta cell function), or hyperinsulinemic (low insulin sensitivity, high beta cell function). We hypothesized that patients with hyperinsulinemic T2D have the highest prevalence of DPN and that hyperinsulinemia per se is independently associated with DPN above and beyond other components of the metabolic syndrome. Objectives: To investigate the association between hyperinsulinemia with DPN. Methods: We included 3397 recently diagnosed T2D patients (median diabetes duration 1y [IQR 0-3]) prospectively enrolled in the Danish Center for Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes (DD2) Cohort between 2010-2015. Insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function were quantified with the HOMA2 model based on baseline fasting serum C-peptide and plasma glucose levels. DPN was defined as a score of 4 when answering the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument questionnaire sent out median 3 years after DD2 enrollment. We used multiple chained equation to impute missing values of potential confounders and applied Poisson regression to calculate age-, sex-, diabetes duration-, drug therapy- and lifestyle adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) of DPN. Results: We identified 900 (27%) hyperinsulinemic, 2150 (63%) classical, and 347 (10%) insulinopenic T2D patients. Hyperinsulinemic patients had higher waist circumference (88/102 cm in females/males; 36% of insulinopenic, 75% of classical, 89% of hyperinsulinemic), more self-reported sedentary lifestyle (9%, 21%, 49%), higher triglycerides (1.7 mmol/L; 13%, 35%, 42%), but intermediate high HbA1c levels (7.5%; 8%, 12%, 6%). The aPR of DPN was 1.42 (95% CI 1.21-1.65) for hyperinsulinemic T2D patients, compared with the classical phenotype. The prevalence remained elevated (1.35 [1.15-1.57]) after further adjustment for central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, and HbA1c. For the insulinopenic patients, the partly and fully aPRs of DPN were 0.86 (0.65-1.14) and 1.03 (0.77-1.38), respectively. In additional spline analyzes, increasing hyperinsulinemia was a strong driver of DPN even after adjusting for insulin resistance. In contrast, the effect of insulin resistance on DPN disappeared when adjusting for hyperinsulinemia.",1.0,clinical,True

3396,"Background: Lower extremity (LEX) strains, including hamstring, quadriceps, adductor, and calf strains, are among the most common injuries in sports. Injury reduction strategies and policies can be refined by understanding occurrence and incidence using Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data linked to player participation exposure information. Objectives: To describe the incidence of LEX strains in professional American football using a standardized, linked EMR database. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study of LEX strains in the National Football League (NFL) during the 2015-2019 seasons identified in the standardized Leaguewide EMR (n ,"" 32 teams). Injury data in the EMR were linked with game statistics and player participation to calculate injury risk and incidence rates. All players who played in at least one NFL game or who sustained a LEX strain during NFL participation (game or non-game) were included in risk calculations. LEX Strain frequency was calculated by setting (game, practice, conditioning), season (offseason, preseason, regular season, postseason), and roster position. Game incidence rates per 1000 plays and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for season, roster position, and play type. Results: Across 5 seasons, 5780 LEX strains were reported among 2769 players (1-season risk: 26.7%, 95% CI 26.0%-27.3%), 69% (n "","" 4015) of which resulted in time-loss. Among time-loss strains, 58.5% were hamstring (n "","" 2347), 21.3% were adductor (n "","" 855), 11.8% were calf (n "","" 474), 8.0% were quadriceps (n "","" 323), and 0.4% affected multiple muscle groups (n "", 16).

Among preseason practice strains, 72% (n "","" 775) were reported during the Training Camp period. In games, punt plays had nearly twice the rate as kickoff plays (14.9/1000 plays; 95% CI 13.1-17.0 vs. 7.5/1000 plays; 95% CI 6.2-8.9, respectively) and over three times the rate as pass (4.3/1000 plays; 95% CI 4.0-4.7) and run (2.6/1000 plays; 95% CI 2.3-2.9) plays. Conclusions: LEX strains impact 1 in 4 NFL players each season and occur mostly during preseason practices and regular season games, causing a high patient burden in terms of pain, injury management, and time lost from physical activity. The 2-week period of Training Camp practices comprised 19% of all time-loss strains, which draws focus on the need for reduction efforts as players acclimate to sports participation.

Objectives: To examine the annual LD prevalence between 2007 and 2019 and specific clinical outcomes in 2018-2019 among the US commercially insured population. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using the 2007- 2019 Clinformatics® Data Mart, an integrated commercial healthcare claims database in the US. For each calendar year within the study, we assembled an adult LD cohort (age 18 years) who were continuously enrolled, allowing a 45-day gap, and had 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient LD diagnoses. The LD cohort included the subgroups: nonHIV-associated LD (non-HIV-LD) and HIV-associated LD (HIV-LD). Standardized annual LD prevalence based on the age and sex distribution of the 2019 US population was calculated. The prevalence of various clinical outcomes in 2018-2019 was estimated among the nonHIV-LD and HIV-LD subgroups. They were compared against ageand sex-matched control groups with a 1:4 ratio from the general population with neither an LD or an HIV diagnosis using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals. Results: The age and sex standardized prevalence of non-HIV-LD in the general adult population slightly increased from 2.3/100 000 in 2007 to 2.9/100.000 in 2019, while the prevalence of HIV-LD stayed stable (1.9/100 000 in 2019).

Objectives: To demonstrate a process that evaluates US data sources from which diversity targets for clinical trials can be generated to improve representation of patients, specifically race and ethnicity (R/E). Methods: Data and literature were evaluated based on population representativeness, sample size, recency or study period, sensitivity/ ability to identify the indication, granularity of R/E categories, completeness of data collected, known and potential biases. Each R/E category's share of the total prevalent/incident case population was generated and expressed as a range of proportions, considering the potential limitations and/or biases of each RWD source specific to each of the 27 indications evaluated. Demographic distributions may be applied to US census data to estimate the real-world population, where appropriate. The following sources were queried for R/E per indication of interest: 1. Longitudinal patient electronic medical records systems (EMRs); Integrated Health Network EMR and Ambulatory EMR; indications defined by ICD10 diagnosis codes and established coding algorithms 2. Government sources of publicly available electronic datasets including CDC's cross-sectional household survey: National Health Interview Survey 3. Publications were graded and ranked using CDC Principles of Epidemiology in Public Health Practice, Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative, and Good Research for Comparative Effectiveness (GRACE) Principles Results: The consistency of R/E distributions between RWD sources varied by each indication but demonstrated reliability based on the known data characteristics. For example, R/E distributions for acute events (eg, stroke) tended to be adequately captured in EMR, yet in some cases comprehensive estimates were available in literature and CDC data (eg, diabetes). Critical factors include inpatient/outpatient records, sample size and sample population, access and treatment disparities resulting in underrepresentation in healthcare system data, and differences in data capture (eg, categories and definitions).

Objectives: To illustrate how clustering and visualization of healthcare pathways can enhance the characterization of patients with prostate cancer, at all disease stages. Methods: Patients with prostate cancer in 2014 were identified in SNDS and their healthcare data were extracted with up to 5 years of history and 4 of follow-up. Fifty-one specific healthcare encounters constitutive of prostate cancer management were synthetized into 4 macro-variables using clustering of variables approach. Values of these macro-variables over patient follow-ups constituted healthcare pathways. Optimal matching using TRATE substitution method was applied to calculate distances between pathways. Partitioning around medoids algorithm was then used to define consistent groups of similar pathways across four exclusive cohorts of incident prostate cancer patients: hormone-sensitive (HSPC), metastatic hormone-sensitive (mHSPC), castration-resistant (CRPC), and metastatic castration-resistant (mCRPC). Index plots were used to represent pathway clusters. Results: The repartition of macro-variables values - surveillance, local treatment, androgenic deprivation, and advanced treatment - appeared to be consistent with HSPC, mHSPC, CRPC and mCRPC status. Two to five clusters of healthcare pathways were observed in each of the different cohorts, corresponding for most of them to relevant clinical patterns. For instance, clustering allowed to distinguish patients undergoing local treatment with or without androgen deprivation therapy in HSPC; patients with rapid and slow disease progression in CRPC; patients with curative, non-curative treatment, or treatment-free interval in mHSPC.

3418,"Background: Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (CLE) is an autoimmune disease that may present with or without systemic manifestations. There are limited published population-based, epidemiologic studies on CLE, most of which have been conducted in the United States (US) and Europe in predominantly White populations. Two published studies from the US suggest a higher incidence and prevalence of CLE among non-White individuals (Drenkard, 2019, Izmirly, 2019). Some evidence suggests that there are ethnoracial differences in the clinical presentation of CLE. Electronic health record (EHR) databases are an efficient source of rich demographic and clinical data on large numbers of CLE patients from diverse settings. To date, limited CLE epidemiologic studies that include significant numbers of African American (AA) patients have been conducted in large EHR databases. Objectives: The main objectives were to describe the demographic characteristics of CLE patients in a large EHR population in the United States (US). In addition, the prevalence of comorbidities among CLE patients were compared to non-CLE matched controls and variations among African American CLE patients were further explored. Methods: A descriptive longitudinal study was conducted using the Optum Deidentified Electronic Health Record Dataset (n ,"" 103 million) from 2007 to 2019, across the US including inpatient and ambulatory electronic health records. For each CLE patient, two general population controls free of CLE or SLE any time in the database, were matched to the cases on: year of birth, gender, total time in the database, and enrollment status. Comorbidities were classified using the Clinical Classification System developed by the Agency for Health Research Quality (CCSR). Results: A total of 27 532 adult CLE patients were identified, 81% were female (F/M ratio "","" 4/1). CLE patients were 70.5% White, 17.9% AA, 1.6% Asian, and 4.8% Hispanic.

Using NICE guidelines, we selected relevant indicators of RA diagnosis, treatment, and management. We included all patients in England in CPRD Aurum and CPRD GOLD with an incident diagnosis of RA on or after 1 January 2005, at least 2 years after registration. Results: We found 53 083 and 18 167 patients with a new diagnosis of RA in CPRD Aurum and CPRD GOLD, respectively. In both databases approximately 67% were female with similar mean ages at first diagnosis. Before first RA diagnosis, CPRD Aurum patients were more likely to have more RA specific labs recorded at any time, and more supporting codes recorded. After diagnosis, CPRD Aurum patients were more likely to have 2 or more diagnoses of RA recorded and 10 or more general RA labs recorded, and patients in CPRD GOLD were more likely to have 10 or more prescriptions for conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARD). Otherwise, the distribution of drugs used to treat RA was similar between databases. The standardized incidence of RA was similar between databases. Correctness appeared somewhat higher in CPRD Aurum compared to CPRD GOLD. Conclusions: Overall, among RA patients, recording of diagnoses, prescription drugs and labs were similar between CPRD Aurum and CPRD GOLD. Slight differences were found for a few variables under study, but overall, we found consistency between the databases. In addition, standardized incidence of RA was similar between databases. This validation study provides assurance of the quality of the new Aurum database that, given its size, could play an important role in health research.",1.0,disease,True

3427,"Background: Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is frequently diagnosed among patients with multiple myeloma (MM), and may result from the underlying disease or treatment. Timely and effective management of PN is essential to minimizing the severity and maintaining therapeutic efficacy in treatment-emergent PN. Clinical trials or small observational studies outside of the United States or Europe have reported high rates of treatment-related PN in bortezomib- and thalidomidebased regimens, but generalizable information on PN in patients with MM in the US is lacking. Objectives: To evaluate the 30-day incidence of PN among newly diagnosed patients with MM and among those initiating a bortezomib- or thalidomide-containing regimen. Methods: Patients were identified between January 2013 and September 2020 in IQVIA PharMetrics® Plus and between January 2008 and October 2020 in Optum Claims. Newly diagnosed patients with MM were identified in two US real world data sources using a MM diagnosis [index event] for the first time in a patient's medical history, a second MM diagnostic code between 30 and 90 days post-index, and 1 procedure code for bone marrow aspirate, biopsy, or interpretation OR procedure codes for at least two distinct diagnostic tests 90 days before or after the index event. Patients with MM initiating a bortezomib- or thalidomidecontaining regimen were identified based on a pharmacy code for bortezomib or thalidomide for the first time in the medical record [index event], and the same criteria for the newly diagnosed cohort occurring at most 365 days before the index event. Thirty-day incidence rates were calculated per 1000 patient-years and are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on the Fisher's exact test. Results: Among newly diagnosed patients with MM, the 30-day incidence of PN was 319.2 (95% CI: 280.7-361.5) in the IQVIA PharMetrics® Plus database (N , 13 697) and 365.4 (95% CI: 324.5-410.0) per 1000 patient-years in the Optum Claims database (N , 15 161). Higher rates of PN were observed among males compared with females and among individuals with type 2 diabetes compared to those without. The incidence of PN in bortezomib-exposed patients was 367.7 (95% CI: 316.2-425.1) in IQVIA PharMetrics® Plus (N , 8862) and 349.4 (95% CI: 294.8-411.1) in Optum Claims (N ,"" 8130). For patients exposed to thalidomide, the incidence of PN was 857.1 (95% CI: 442.9-1497.0) in IQVIA PharMetrics® Plus (N "", 287) and 321.4 (95% CI: 147.0-610.2) in Optum Claims (N , 484). Conclusions: This study describes a high burden of PN (~ >30%) both after MM diagnosis as well as after initiation of treatment for MM and elucidates the need for enhanced surveillance and identification of neuroprotective strategies.",1.0,disease,True

Objectives: To determine the incidence rate of ischemic stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF), and heart failure (HF) within 90 days after an incident MI as well as the average duration of time for these events to occur after MI. Methods: This was a descriptive, retrospective study using administrative medical and pharmacy claims data from a commercially insured US population (IQVIA PharMetrics® Plus). This study included adults who experienced an MI between January 2016 and December 2020 and had at least one year of enrollment in the database prior to the MI. Individuals were followed starting on the day after their MI and up until 90 days after their MI for the occurrence of ischemic stroke, AF, and HF. Baseline patient characteristics were ascertained using all available data prior to the MI, including demographic variables, comorbidities, and select medication use. The incidence rates of each outcome following MI and the duration of days between MI and the outcomes were calculated in the overall cohort and within pre-defined subgroups. Results: A total of 457 068 individuals had an MI during the study period and were eligible for inclusion in the study. Ischemic stroke after an MI occurred in 34 656 individuals, AF after an MI occurred in 18 917 individuals, and HF after an MI occurred in 27 544 individuals. Incidence rates of ischemic stroke, AF, and HF occurring within 90 days of MI were 355.4 (95% [Confidence Interval] CI: 351.7, 359.2), 233.1 (95% CI: 229.8, 236.4), and 409.7 (95% CI: 404.9, 414.6) per 1000 person-years, respectively. For all three outcomes, incidence rates were higher in subgroups of individuals who were aged 65 years, individuals with a history of peripheral artery disease, and individuals with a history of diabetes. Of those individuals who experienced an outcome of interest, it took on average 19, 21, and 20 days to experience stroke, AF, and HF following their MI, respectively. Conclusions: This study highlights the demographics, comorbidities, medication use, and incidence of select clinical events occurring among a cohort of real-world patients in the acute phase after an MI.

3436,"Background: In the United States (US), the use of imaging to diagnose and monitor osteoarthritis (OA) patients in clinical practice is not well characterized, and few recommendations are provided in clinical guidelines. Characterization of imaging (x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computerized tomography (CT)) is important to understand its utility for assessing OA progression. Objectives: To estimate the frequency of imaging for diagnosis or monitoring of patients with knee and/or hip OA in US clinical settings, overall, and by patient and physician characteristics. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study used data from the 2020 US Adelphi Disease Specific Program for OA, which surveyed physicians who made treatment decisions for  10 OA patients per month. Validated statistical survey methods have been published (Anderson 2008). Rheumatologists (n ,"" 35), orthopedists (n "","" 27), pain specialists (n "","" 14), and primary care physicians (PCPs) (n "","" 50) were included. Surveyed physicians completed a record form on 1012 consecutive OA patients 18 years old. Analyzes were limited to patients diagnosed with hip and/or knee OA. Patient characteristics were described overall, and by joint type. Descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, proportion) were used to summarize frequency of imaging overall, and by joint type and current pain level. Results were also stratified by physician specialty and insurance type. Results: The study included 1120 patients with knee (61.6%), hip (19.7%), and both knee/hip (18.7%) OA. Mean age was 65.1 years, and 46.5% were male. Patients were primarily Caucasian (71.8%) and African American (14.4%), with the majority covered by Medicare (50.5%) or commercial insurance (37.2%). Characteristics were similar by joint type. To diagnose OA, 91.3% of patients underwent x-ray, 27.0% MRI, and 5.9% no imaging. Imaging for monitoring was less frequent, with 69.3% undergoing x-ray and 12.9% an MRI to monitor OA in the past 12 months. CT scans were infrequent for diagnosis and monitoring (<1% of patients). Among patients imaged for monitoring, reasons included identifying worsening (69.9%) or new (30.5%) symptoms, or routine check-up (34.8%). The proportion of patients undergoing x-ray monitoring increased by pain severity (57% mild, 73% moderate, 81% severe). Among patients with moderate/severe pain, the proportion of patients undergoing x-ray monitoring was highest among orthopedists (orthopedist 85.9%, pain specialist 76.4%, PCP 74.3%, rheumatologist 70.3%). Conclusions: In this sample of US patients, imaging was widely used to diagnose OA. Imaging was used to a lesser extent to monitor OA, with frequency varying by pain level and physician specialty.""",1.0,clinical,True
3437,"Background: Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) affects an estimated 30% of women, impacting their health and quality of life. Despite the availability of non-invasive therapeutic options, including the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUS), up to 54% of women with HMB never receive a proper diagnosis or treatment. A delay in diagnosis may require more invasive treatment with fertility risk. Large real-world population-based studies on HMB are lacking. Objectives: The Champion-HMB network study of real-world data aimed to describe the incidence rate and proportion of women diagnosed with HMB from 2000 to 2020, their baseline characteristics, longitudinal treatment pathways, and treatment guideline compliance in three countries with different healthcare systems. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used 20 years of anonymized data standardized to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnerships (OMOP) common data model (CDM) from four databases: electronic health records (EHR) from France (IQVIA LPD, primary care) and Germany (IQVIA DA, primary care and outpatient specialist), and claims from the USA (MarketScan, Optum). Seven cohorts were defined: (1) all women aged 11-55 years with continuous observation data of 365 days, and all women: (2) with an HMB diagnosis; (3) with HMB of unknown cause, (4) starting LNG-IUS treatment, (5) receiving, and (6) not receiving guideline-compliant treatment, and (7) with cervical cancer or endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. Patients were followed up until natural or medical menopause, hysterectomy, bilateral ovariectomy, age 55, or death. Results: The descriptive analysis examined patient demographics, comorbidities, and underlying causes of HMB. HMB treatment pathways, LNG-IUS treatment duration and switching were also analyzed. Women receiving and not receiving first-line guideline-compliant treatment were identified and the frequency of surgical treatment (hysterectomy and endometrial ablation) was assessed. Of 55 974 084 eligible women, 3 049 915 (5.4%) with HMB were identified (39 565 in France, 118 885 in Germany and 2 629 643 in the USA). Conclusions: Advanced network analytics allowed us to generate standardized, timely, real-world evidence into the patient journeys of women with HMB from diverse populations, countries, and datasets. The results show country-specific differences in HMB diagnosis, management, and variation in capture by setting (primary or specialist care, or hospital databases).

Methods: We conducted a population based descriptive study using primary care electronic health records from IQVIA Medical Research Data (IMRD-UK). A validated method utilizing read codes attributed to a clinical diagnosis of hypertension was used to identify the study population of 2 133 118 adults aged 40 years and over with hypertension between 2000 to 2021. The annual incidence rate of dementia was estimated and further stratified by sex, 10-year age bands and Townsend deprivation quintiles. Confidence intervals were estimated assuming Poisson distribution. Incidence rates were calculated using the number of new dementia cases in adults with hypertension and dividing by the person-years at risk (PYAR) of dementia. Results: A total of 85 245 adults with hypertension had a new diagnosis of dementia between 2000 and 2021. The incidence rate of dementia increased from 1.98 per 1000 PYAR (95% CI 1.89-2.07) in 2000 to 5.29 per 1000 PYAR (95% CI 5.07-5.53) in 2021. Females with hypertension had a higher incidence of dementia; 4.43 per 1000 PYAR (95% CI 4.40-4.47), than males; 3.07 per 1000 PYAR (95% CI 3.04-3.11). Those aged over 80 with hypertension had the highest incidence of dementia; 20.14 per 1000 PYAR (95% CI 19.78-20.50).

The study base comprised all rehabilitation stays of all patients who were admitted to inpatient rehabilitation at ZURZACH Care, Rehaklinik Bad Zurzach, Switzerland, between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2018. Incident delirium episodes were defined as those rehabilitation stays during which incident delirium took place. We calculated the cumulative incidence of delirium during rehabilitation. Within the study base and separately within incident delirium episodes, we summarized continuous variables as means with standard deviations, and categorical variables as absolute and relative frequencies. Results: Within the study base comprising 10'503 rehabilitation stays, we identified 125 validated incident delirium episodes (cumulative incidence: 1.2%). Patients with incident delirium episodes were more often male (56.0% vs. 44.6%), on average older (mean age: 77.2 vs. 66.8 years), had a longer mean rehabilitation stay (33.1 vs. 25.3 days), a higher disease burden (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS]: 18.8 vs. 14.7), and a higher average number of administered drugs (9.0 vs. 6.9) than those of the study base.

3468,"authors' experiences there is a clustering in products for the treatment of neurological and endocrine/metabolic diseases. Objectives: This research aims to characterize trends in extension studies in interventional research over the last 20 years using metadata from a large clinical trial registry. Methods: Clinicaltrials.gov was searched for interventional studies containing the terms ""longterm extension"" or ""open-label extension"" posted from 01-Jan-2002 to 31-Dec-2021. 1737 studies were returned and 728 were excluded as they were determined not to be stand-alone extension studies. 1009 studies included in the analysis were mapped to ICD-11 taxonomy based on study indication and divided into 2 time periods: P1: first posted between 2002 and 2011, and P2: first posted date between 2012 and 2021. Studies were further analyzed by study phase, design characteristics and therapeutic area. Results: There was a 37.4% increase in the number of studies in P2 compared to P1, mainly attributable to studies in early development (phase 1 to phase 2), which increased by75.6%. 12.7% of studies were randomized and 8.0% where OLEs. 19.0% had a parallel groups design and 13.7% were OLEs. 5.9% of studies included masking, with 3.5% of LTEs including masking of both participant and investigator. There were no notable differences between the 2 time periods. Studies were most frequently conducted in diseases of the nervous system (22.9%) followed by endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases (12.4%). Conclusions: These findings point to a trend towards initiating extension studies earlier in development over the last 10 years. We identified a sizable number of OLEs that included control groups and randomization and LTEs that included masking, which serves to generate more scientifically robust results. The finding that extension studies were most frequent in neurological and endocrine/metabolic indications confirmed the authors own experience and may be related to high proportions of rare disease and high disease burden in these areas, which would require further investigation.",1.0,cluster,True
3469,"Objectives: To assess the comparative effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors vs. dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors in reducing the incidence of stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). Methods: We conducted a new-user active comparator cohort study design using a US-based commercial healthcare insurance database from 1 January 2015 to 30 June 2020. We included patients who: (a) initiated treatment with a SGLT2 inhibitor or DPP4 inhibitor; (b) had 12 months of continuous enrollment prior to treatment initiation (i.e., lookback period); (c) had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during lookback period; and (d) were 18 years or older at cohort entry. The main outcome was a composite of stroke and MI. Patients in the cohort were followed until the earliest of: treatment discontinuation, switch to the comparator drug, outcome, disenrollment from healthcare benefits, death, or end of study period. We adjusted for confounders via propensity score matching. We used Cox proportional-hazards regression with a robust variance estimator to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) while adjusting for calendar time. We stratified the primary analysis by individual outcomes. Results: The matched cohort included 135 482 new users of SGLT2 inhibitors and 135 482 new users of DPP4 inhibitors. The incidence rates of the stroke-MI composite per 100 person-years were 2.6 and 3.0 for SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP4 inhibitors, respectively. In Cox proportional-hazards models, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with a lower rate of stroke or MI (adjusted HR (aHR), 0.93; 95% CI 0.88-0.98) compared to DPP4 inhibitors. The benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors vs. DPP4 inhibitors was evident for stroke (aHR, 0.82; 95% CI 0.71- 0.95) but not myocardial infarction (aHR, 0.99; 95% CI 0.88-1.13). Conclusions: Use of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with a lower rate of a composite outcome of stroke or MI compared to DPP4 inhibitors. This finding appears to be driven by a lower incidence of stroke in persons taking SGLT2 inhibitors.",0.0,,False

3507,"Background: While medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) has been effective, treatment initiation has been a challenge. Objectives: The objective of this study was to examine race/ethnicity and regional geographic factors associated with initiation and supplyside barriers to initiation for MOUD. Methods: EMBASE and PubMed databases were searched for observational studies examining race/ethnicity, supply-side, and geographic correlates of MOUD initiation. Articles were examined, grouped by factors summarized, and findings were collated. Results: Thirty-eight observational studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. Non-white individuals were almost universally disadvantaged in initiating MOUD therapy, particularly buprenorphine therapy, despite on average residing closer to clinics than white patients. Fourteen studies utilizing data from electronic health records, public insurance, private insurance, and state and federal administrative records found disparities in MOUD treatment initiation. Buprenorphine was also less utilized by non-White patients. The disparity in buprenorphine use among non-white patients in comparison to white patients may be due to lack of availability. Availability is a function of clinics, physicians possessing a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine, and waivered physician patient capacity to prescribe buprenorphine. According to the studies examined for this review, all these factors are lacking in non-White communities. One study postulated that this may be due in part to lack of physician resources to obtain waivers in already under-resourced areas. This leaves patients with the option of naltrexone or methadone from a specialty clinic. Three studies reported on the distribution of buprenorphine and methadone providers in the United States. All noted that buprenorphine availability was not even across all states and regions. The Northeast, particularly Rhode Island, has the most methadone clinics per 100 000 population in 2019. Wyoming was the worst in terms of methadone availability. Conversely, in terms of buprenorphine, states west of the Mississippi exhibited the least access to treatment (Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota). Conclusions: There is strong evidence from this review that there are both race/ethnicity and regional disparities in MOUD initiation and supply-side barriers to initiation. The lack of buprenorphine availability in non-white communities is particularly troubling. There is growing evidence that naltrexone is not as effective as buprenorphine in preventing mortality from opioid overdose. If naltrexone is more often the only available medication for some communities, this presents a significant health equity issue. These findings warrant further research into the causes of these disparities to act quickly and efficiently via policy, physician education, or public health education.",1.0,area,True

We compared the effectiveness and safety outcomes in adult warfarin users (18 years) who underwent bariatric surgery to those who did not undergo bariatric surgery. We examined the incidence of stroke, Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), VTE, and major and minor bleeding. We performed Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the risk of effectiveness and safety outcomes and propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to adjust for baseline demographic, confounders, and clinical characteristics. Results: We assessed a total of 677 320 patients who met the study inclusion criteria.

The selected features included metformin, year, age, gender, race, marital status, education attainment, rural-urban residence, census regions, household income, Charlson comorbidities index (CCI), body mass index (BMI), and health status. Metformin was identified based on the generic name of metformin and the glucophage, glucophage XR, fortamet, glumetza, and riomet. Patients with ADRD were identified based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. stochastic gradient boosting (XGboost) was used to examine the effects of metformin on the risk of ADRD. In addition, Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used to identify the contribution and association of features to the risk of ADRD. All analyzes were conducted using python 3.8. Results: 33 590 individuals were included in this study. One-third of the included people (11 197) were assigned to the training group, and two-thirds (22 393) were assigned to the test group. The top 5 factors associated with the risk of ADRD were age, comorbidities, marital status, BMI, and race. Based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the prediction performance was 0.51. According to the confusion matrix, the accuracy and the precision of the model were 94.4% and 45.7%, respectively. According to SHAP, although metformin ranked low among all features, it predicted a low risk of ADRD with the SHAP ranging from À0.022 to 0.003. Conclusions: Our results suggest that age, comorbidities, marital status, BMI, and race are the most important predictors of the risk of ADRD. In addition, metformin may have a protective effect against the risk of ADRD.",1.0,disease,True

Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of adjuvant therapy with CT alone and CT plus TA in mCRC patients on survival outcome, and examine the interaction between neo-adjuvant therapy and survival outcome among mCRC patients receiving adjuvant CT plus TA or not, using the Taiwan population databases. Methods: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database (NHID) and Taiwan Cancer Registry, we identified patients with mCRC who received adjuvant therapy from January first, 2009, through December 3first, 2019. Overall survival of patients who received primary tumor resection and metastasectomy was assessed after receiving adjuvant CT alone or CT plus TA. The multivariable analysis for survival outcome after adjuvant therapy was performed via Cox regression. We matched CT alone to CT plus TA group by propensity scores (PS) matching and weighting 2.69 (1.95-3.69). Results: Overall, 697 patients with mCRC were enrolled in our study; 429 and 268 patients received CT alone or CT plus TA therapy, respectively. Compared with adjuvant CT alone, adjuvant CT plus TA resulted in similar mortality among mCRC patients after primary tumor resection and metastasectomy (hazard ratio [HR],"" 1.00; 95% CI, 0.82-1.22), whereas adjuvant CT plus TA did marginally reduce the mortality rate among patients treated with neo-adjuvant with TA (HR "","" 0.51; 95% CI, 0.25- 1.04) after PS weighting. Among patients treated adjuvant CT alone, neoadjuvant CT with TA was associated with higher mortality (HR "","" 2.69; 95% CI, 1.95- 3.69) than patients who received neo-adjuvant CT alone. Conclusions: Although overall results demonstrate survival is similar between adjuvant CT plus TA and CT alone, our findings suggest that the adjuvant CT plus TA would improve OS benefit compared to adjuvant CT alone if mCRC patients received neo-adjuvant CT plus TA. This would underscore the importance of stratification by neoadjuvant CT with TA or not in applying current treatment guidelines and for future clinical trials.""",1.0,clinical,True

SGLT2i users were patients prescribed SGLT2is during their hospitalization or at discharge, and non-users were those not prescribed SGLT2is during this period. Propensity score matching was done in a 1:1 ratio between SGLT2i users and nonusers to balance potential confounders. Primary outcomes were the HF readmission and in-hospital mortality at 30 days after discharge. Exploratory outcomes were cardiorenal safety outcomes of myocardial infarction, stroke, and acute kidney injury. We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the study outcomes associated with SGLT2i use versus non-use. Results: Of 25 627 patients with type 2 diabetes newly hospitalized with HF, we identified 1067 patient-pairs of SGLT2i users and nonusers after propensity score matching (mean age 69.1 years; 51.8% male). Among 166 events of HF readmissions within 30 days after discharge, 69 occurred in SGLT2i users and 97 in non-users, with its risk significantly lower among SGLT2i users versus non-users (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.95). Meanwhile, the risk of 30-day in-hospital deaths was statistically non-significant between exposure groups (0.60, 0.22 to 1.65); 6 and 10 events occurred in SGLT2i users and in non-users, respectively. Findings from our exploratory analyzes showed no increased risks for the cardiorenal safety outcomes associated with SGLT2is when compared with non-users.

Objectives: To evaluate the immediate change in LDL-C (first 3 months of treatment) and the LDL-C long-term control (up to 10 years) after statins treatment initiation in people prescribed statins regularly. Methods: Retrospective cohort study. Using UK primary care data (The Health Improvement Network) from >500 general practices, we evaluated individuals aged 35 to 99 between 2008 and 2018 who were prescribed statins regularly. We performed an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis. We modeled LDL-Cholesterol change over time using continuous linear splines with random intercept and slopes models, from which three slopes of LDL-Cholesterol change were estimated for 1) -10 years to baseline (first statin prescription) (pretreatment: 31); 2) baseline to +3 months (immediate impact: 32); 3) +3 months to +10 years (long-term control: 33); overall and stratified by gender (women/men) and dose (low/high).

We found that statins initiation reduced, on average, À1.3 mmol/L in the first 3 months of treatment (adjusted for confounders). It represented an immediate control from 3.8 mmol/L to 2.5 mmol/L, on average. In the long term, the LDL-Cholesterol remained controlled, showing an average increment from 2.5 mmol/L to 2.7 mmol/L in 10 years. Women reduced 10% more than men their LDL-Cholesterol in the short term (3 months), and 62% in the long term (up to 10 years). High doses of statins were 21% more effective to reduce LDL-Cholesterol in the short term, and 58% in the long term. Conclusions: People prescribed statins regularly control their LDLCholesterol in the long term. The notable LDL-Cholesterol reduction experienced in the first 3 months of treatment, which usually leads to optimal levels, is typically maintained during the following years. Being women and being prescribed high dose are both factors that benefit LDL-Cholesterol control in the short and long term.""",1.0,,True

Methods: EPICOS is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted in 51 hospitals in Spain, Bolivia, and Venezuela. Healthcare workers with negative SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG test were randomly assigned to: daily TDF/FTC (245mg of TDF and 200 mg of FTC once daily) plus HCQ (200 mg once daily) for 12 weeks, TDF/FTC plus HCQ placebo, HCQ plus TDF/FTC placebo and TDF/FTC placebo plus HCQ placebo. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19. We also studied any (symptomatic or asymptomatic) COVID-19 infection. The target sample size was 4000 participants. We compared group-specific 14-week risks via differences and ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Of 1002 individuals screened, 926 (92.4%) were eligible; 64.2% recruited in Spain, 22.3% in Bolivia, and 13.6% in Venezuela. Median age was 38 years (range 18-68), 62.5% were female, 62.3% worked at inpatient care, and comorbidities were rare. Compared with the placebo group, 14-week risk ratios (95% CI) of symptomatic COVID-19 were 0.39 (0.00, 1.98) for TDF+HCQ, 0.34 (0.00, 2.06) for TDF, and 0.49 (0.00, 2.29) for HCQ. Corresponding risk ratios of any COVID-19 were 0.51 (0.21, 1.00) for TDF+HCQ, 0.81 (0.44, 1.49) for TDF, and 0.73 (0.41, 1.38) for HCQ.

We obtained or calculated the risk ratio of COVID-19 diagnosis for assignment to HCQ versus no HCQ (either placebo or usual care) for each trial, and then pooled the risk ratio estimates. We used a fixed effect, the standard random effect, and a modified Hartung-Knapp approaches. Results: The primary outcome definition varied across trials, with some trials using the presence of symptoms with or without laboratory confirmation, others using laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 and others laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without symptoms. Two studies were excluded because they had no events in the HCQ arm. The pooled risk ratio estimate of the pre-exposure prophylaxis trials was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.580.90) when using either a fixed effect or a standard random effects approach, and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.52-0.95) when using a conservative modification of the Hartung-Knapp random effects approach.

Methods: This population-based cohort study includes incident MND patients from 1993 to 2018 in Hong Kong. The data was collected from a clinical electronic database, the Clinical Data Analysis and Report System, covering all Hong Kong public hospitals. The observation period was from the onset of MND to their death date, study end date (December 3first, 2018) or first use of edaravone, whichever comes first. We censored the observation period when the patient is exposed to edavarone because, as the second approved drug for MND, its inclusion may affect the association. A multivariable Cox regression model was conducted for estimating hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality among riluzole users and non-users.

Objectives: To identify non-opioid medications associated with falls or fractures in OA patients on opioid therapy for at least 90 days. Methods: Using two US healthcare claims databases (2003-2020) and a case-crossover design, we conducted a semi-automated evaluation of non-opioid medications and their association with a fall or fracture (outcomes) in patients on opioids. The analytic cohort consisted of OA patients  40 years who experienced a fall or fracture with at least 365 days of continuous enrollment and at least 90 days of continuous opioid use prior to the outcome date. The hazard window was defined as days 1-30 and referent window as days 61-90 before the outcome date. We quantified the odds ratio (OR) between each non-opioid medication and each outcome. Analyzes were limited to non-opioid medications with at least 500 individuals with discordant exposure across the windows to avoid statistically unstable estimates. Case-crossover estimates in patients with no exposure to opioids were used to adjust for potential time-varying confounding in a case-case-time-control analysis. Results were evaluated in ascending order of p-value, and the false discovery rate (FDR) was used to account for multiple testing. Results: We identified 41 693 OA patients who experienced a fall and 24 891 OA patients who experienced a fracture while on long-term opioid therapy.

The study quality was assessed using the JADAD score. Two reviewers independently screened, extracted and assessed the studies. Any differences were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. The results will be pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.3. The study was registered at PROSPERO [CRD42020176782]. Results: A total of 30 high quality RCTs out of 7470 screened studies, with 57% having a maximum JADAD score of 5 were selected for the review. The primary outcomes of ICS combinations of change from baseline in FEV1 trough [Mean Deviation (MD): 69.54; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 22.5, 116.58; p < 0.0004], change from baseline in the SGRQ-C score [MD: À1.46; 95% CI: À2.23, À0.59; p < 0.0001], and change from baseline in COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score [MD: À1.08; 95% CI: À1.53, À0.63; p < 0.0001] were statistically significant.

3616,"introduction of direct acting antivirals (DAAs) has advanced treatment for HCV due to its high cure rates of over 95%. However, high costs of DAAs are barriers to treatment, prompting national negotiations in Canada to reduce pricing and improve access. Consequently, in 2015 and 2017, policies were implemented allowing DAAs to be widely available, leading to increases in DAA utilization. However, the realworld impact of expanded DAA access is unknown. Objectives: To determine the early change in volumes of hospitalizations associated with liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after expanded DAA access. Methods: We conducted a population-based time series analysis using national administrative databases in Canada from the Canadian Institute for Health Information, including data from all provinces and territories except Quebec. The number of hospitalizations associated with liver disease and HCC were identified monthly and yearly, respectively, between April 2006 and March 2020. We used Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models to assess the trends for each outcome, with ramp functions at 2015 and 2017 denoting the two timepoints during which policies were implemented to expand DAA access. Volumes were analyzed for the overall national population and by age group. Results: Hospitalizations due to liver disease increased steadily in Canada from 2006 to 2020 (average 5756 admissions per month), with no significant changes in 2015 or 2017. Volumes were highest in those aged 65+ (29 689 per year) and lowest in the age < 30 group (3296 per year). Hospitalizations increased in 2015 for those aged 30-49 (p ,"" 0.0149), but ages 50-64 saw volumes plateau in 2015 (p<.0001) and 2017 (p "","" 0.0068). HCC-specific hospitalizations also generally increased during this time (average 225 cases per month), but a significant drop was found in 2017 (p "", 0.0288). Admissions were highest among those aged 50-64 (1147 per year) and 65+ (1390 per year). Ages 30-49 saw a decrease in 2015 (p , 0.0033) followed by an increase in 2017 (p ,"" 0.0161), while ages 50-64 experienced reductions in 2015 (p "","" 0.0073). Conclusions: Expanding DAA access led to fewer HCC-specific hospitalizations in the overall population but had no apparent effect on hospitalizations for liver disease yet. Importantly, significant reductions were observed in the age 50-64 age group.

Evidence is limited on the real-world prevalence of GABAergic medications and their impact on outcomes in patients receiving cancer immunotherapy. Objectives: To characterize the use of GABA receptor positive allosteric modulators (benzodiazepines and zolpidem) among cancer patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Methods: This descriptive study included patients starting immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for lung, head and neck, liver, and renal cancer between January 2010 and June 2019 using IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Medicare databases. Patients were required to be continuously enrolled from 365 days prior to initiation of treatment with atezolizumab, avelumab, cemiplimab, durvalumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab or pembrolizumab and were followed until discontinuation, disenrollment or end of the study period. Baseline and concurrent use of benzodiazepines or zolpidem was identified and cumulative exposure was estimated as daily diazepam equivalent doses. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) associated with treatment discontinuation. Results: Among 8295 patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy included in the study, 1906 (21%) concurrently received benzodiazepines or zolpidem during follow up. Compared to patients that did not receive GABA modulators, patients receiving GABA modulators were older (median age 62 vs 59, P < 0.001) and had a higher proportion of female patients (48%) and prior use of GABA modulators at baseline (66% vs. 16%; P < 0.001). Among patients exposed to GABA modulators during follow up, 29% received 5mg or greater diazepam equivalents per day. Overall, baseline GABA modulator use was associated with lower rates of discontinuation of immunotherapy (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.86-0.97) which varied by cancer site. Conclusions: In this cohort of patients with commercial and Medicare insurance receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for cancer, we found a non-trivial number of patients were concurrently receiving GABA modulators and had an observed lower rate of treatment discontinuation.

Objectives: In this study, we focus on identifying potential new therapeutic benefits of one PPI, rabeprazole sodium, using real-world data from administrative claims. Methods: New users of rabeprazole were identified from five sources: the IBM MarketScan© Commercial, Multi-State Medicaid, and Medicare Supplemental Databases, the Optum© De-Identified Clinformatics© Data Mart, and the Japan Medical Data Center database. Outcomes were defined according to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) classification system codes and required a diagnosis on two or more distinct dates. A selfcontrolled cohort design was used to assess the association between rabeprazole and the incidence of all observed disease outcomes. Empirical null distributions constructed from negative control outcomes were used to adjust for systematic error across a large number of effect estimates. Potential benefits were defined as disease outcomes for which rabeprazole was associated with  30% reduction in incidence (empirically calibrated P  .05) in at least two databases. Results: 908 121 new users of rabeprazole were identified (average age: 50.6 years, average duration of use: 169 days). Of 25 513 outcomes assessed, five potential benefits were associated with rabeprazole after removing conditions related to GERD: benign hypertension (meta-analytic incidence rate ratio (IRR): 0.68, 95% CI: 0.48-0.94), essential hypertension (IRR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.40-0.77), hyperlipidemia (IRR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.43-0.85), acute myocardial infarction of the inferior wall (IRR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.417-0.81), and malaise (IRR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.48-0.99).

Since 2010, OHS has collected data on risk factors for several types of cancer and other chronic conditions, including smoking and skin/hair color. For a subgroup of OHS participants, we obtained linked administrative data to ascertain longitudinal information on drug exposure and outcomes. We studied new-users of HCTZ or ACEi, who were free of NMSC at baseline, and had at least 12-months of enrollment in Ontario's public drug insurance plan. Follow-up started at 12 months after the first prescription (lag time) and continued until NMSC, discontinuation/ switching of initial treatment, death, or loss to follow-up. Multivariable Cox models were used to obtain adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, hair color, comorbidities, current and past use of immunosuppressant and other photosensitizing drugs, and family history of skin cancer. Results: We studied 9398 subjects, 42.9% female and most (56.5%) aged 65-74 years. Age distribution was similar between HCTZ and ACEI groups, with a trend for fewer females in the ACEI group (36% versus 54% in the HCTZ group). Other risk factors were evenly distributed among both groups. We identified 394 NMSC events during a median follow-up of 440 days (interquartile range, 131-1145).

Adopting a prevalent new-user design, we matched bDMARD users to bDMARD naïve patients using time-conditional propensity scores. The risk of incident osteoporotic fractures (including hip, vertebrae, humerus, and forearm) was estimated among the matched patients by Cox proportional-hazards models. Secondary analyzes were performed with stratification by sex and RA disease activity at baseline. Results: Out of 24 678 patients with RA, 4265 bDMARD users were matched to the same number of bDMARD naïve patients (mean age 56.2 years, 74% female).

Currently, there is limited evidence on the impact of baloxavir on clinical outcomes in influenza, especially influenza complications. Objectives: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baloxavir in comparison to placebo or any neuraminidase inhibitor in the treatment of influenza in healthy and at-risk adults and children. Methods: We searched PubMed, Medline, GoogleScholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception until July 2021. We included published randomized controlled trials that met the following criteria: published in English, compared baloxavir with placebo or any neuraminidase inhibitor, and reported at least one relevant efficacy, virology, or safety outcome. No restrictions were set for patients' age. Efficacy outcomes included total complications, time to alleviation of symptoms (TTAS), and change from baseline in virus titers at day 2. The primary safety outcome was all adverse events. We used random-effect models to pool the trial results, and statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I2 test. Results: Out of 307 screened studies, four studies enrolling 2511 patients met our inclusion criteria. Baloxavir did not significantly decrease the likelihood of total complications compared to placebo (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.53; I2 67%) and oseltamivir (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.72; I2 21%). Baloxavir significantly reduced TTAS by 26.55 h (95% CI À33.20 to À19.90; I2 0%) when compared to placebo, however there was no significant difference compared to oseltamivir (À1.14 h, 95% CI À6.33 to 4.05; I2 0%). The mean decline in virus titer from baseline to day 2 was significantly greater for baloxavir than for placebo (mean difference (MD) À2.43 log10TCID50/ ml; 95% CI of À4.05 to À0.80; I2 98%) and oseltamivir (MD À1.75; 95% CI of À1.96 to À1.54; I2 0%). Baloxavir significantly decreased total adverse events compared to both placebo (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.97; I2 0%) and oseltamivir (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98; I2 0%). Conclusions: Baloxavir is superior to placebo and as effective as oseltamivir in shortening the duration of influenza symptoms; however, baloxavir did not demonstrate a significant benefit in decreasing complications when compared to both placebo and oseltamivir.

We defined time-varying exposure to standard (enoxaparin 30 or 40mg QD, fondaparinux 2.5mg, low dose apixaban or rivaroxaban, or heparin 5000u BID or TID) versus high-intensity (enoxaparin 30 or 40mg BID, or up to 1.2mg/kg of body weight QD, heparin 7500u TID, heparin 10 000u BID or TID, or dabigatran 220mg QD) thromboprophylaxis. We separately examined risk of escalation to therapeutic anticoagulation, severe disease (first occurrence of high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation), and death. To summarize risk, we present hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Cox proportional hazards models incorporating time-varying treatment. Results: Persons whose first dose was high intensity (n ,"" 14 224) were younger, more often obese and had greater oxygen support requirements than those who received standard thromboprophylaxis (n "","" 36 969).

Objectives: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of first-line SGLT2 inhibitor use on H-hf among treatment naïve Japanese type-2 DM patients against biguanide or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Methods: We used the Japanese nationwide claims database to extract patients with type2 DM diagnosis newly initiating biguanide, DPP4i or SGLT2i in fiscal year 2014. Those with previous DM drug use or history of heart failure were excluded. To extract similar number of patients in each treatment group, and for the ease of computation, we randomly sampled 100% of SGLT2i, 20% of biguanide, and 3% of DPP4i initiators from the cohort. We followed the patients up to 1080 days after the initiation, and assessed the incidence of H-hf. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for baseline characteristics including age, sex, comorbidities, other medication use and hospitalization history, and inverse probability of censoring weighting for per-protocol effect estimation adjusting for the same variables assessed every 90-days. Weighted Kaplan Meier method was used to estimate 3-year cumulative incidence of hf-H, and weighted Cox model was used for hazard ratio estimation. Results: We extracted 7288 biguanide-, 10 687 DPP4 inhibitor-, and 8976 SGLT2 inhibitor-initiators with mean age (standard deviation) of 60.6 (10.9), 66.9 (11.5), and 57.5 (10.9), respectively.

Methods: HERO-HCQ was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study to evaluate the superiority of HCQ vs placebo for COVID-19 pre-exposure prophylaxis in HCWs. Eligible participants provided consent, were 18 or older, and worked in a healthcare setting. There were two on-site visits - one at baseline and another at 30 days - all other data were participant-reported through an online portal supplemented by call center back-up. Inperson assessments included a nasopharyngeal swab for SARSCoV-2 and a blood sample to assess SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG antibody status. Each participant was randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive a loading dose of HCQ 600 mg twice on Day 1 followed by 400 mg daily for 29 days or matching placebo taken orally. The primary outcome measure was a composite of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 clinical infection by Day 30 defined as new onset fever, cough, or dyspnea and either a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test (confirmed) or a lack of confirmatory testing due to local restrictions (suspected). Results: At 34 US sites, 1360 HCW were enrolled between April and November 2020. Enrollment closed before full accrual due to recruitment challenges.

Crit Care Med. 2021;49: e1025-e1036) that were conducted exclusively among patients with a FXa inhibitor-associated acute major bleed treated with 4F-PCC or studies with results for 4F-PCC-treated patients reported separately were included in this meta-analysis. Estimates of hemostatic effectiveness were pooled using a Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) random effects model in STATA statistical software version 16.1 (StataCorp., 2019). Results: Nine observational cohort studies with a total of 677 patients treated with 4F-PCC for Factor Xa inhibitor-associated acute major bleeding were identified; seven studies were conducted retrospectively and two were conducted prospectively. Studies were conducted in the United States (7), Sweden (1), and Canada (1). Two studies reported 12-hour effectiveness and seven studies reported 24-hour effectiveness. Four studies were conducted exclusively among patients with an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and five studies included patients with an ICH or other type of bleed. Overall, 79% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 74%-84%) of 4F-PCC-treated patients were assessed as having a favorable hemostatic effectiveness. Favorable hemostatic effectiveness was 89% (95% CI: 81%-94%) and 77% (95% CI: 72%-82%) for patients measured at 12 and 24 h, respectively. Favorable hemostatic effectiveness was 83% (95% CI: 75%- 90%) and 76% (95% CI: 69%-82%) among studies including patients with only ICH or studies including patients with mixed bleed types, respectively. Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides an assessment of hemostasis effectiveness of 4F-PCC used to treat FXa inhibitor-associated acute major bleeding. Clinical studies are needed to confirm the results seen in the real-world as 4F-PCC could provide an effective alternative to the currently available treatments.",1.0,Clinical,True

3765,"Background: Pregnant women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 are particularly at risk of maternal and pregnancy adverse outcomes. Since the beginning of the pandemic, clinical guidelines have drastically changed, as new treatments and data have emerged overtime. Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe the use of COVID19 related drugs during pregnancy and their evolution between the early and late period of the pandemic. Methods: This was an international prospective cohort study including pregnant women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from March, 2020, to July, 2021, through the COVI-PREG registry. We collected exposure to the following COVID-19 related drug categories: antibiotics, antivirals, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), corticosteroids, antiinterleukin-6 (anti-IL-6) and immunoglobulins. A descriptive analysis was performed to determine the prevalence of drugs used at the substance level and category level stratified by trimester of pregnancy, maternal COVID-19 severity level and early and late period of the pandemic (before and after July, 1, 2020). Results: We included 1'964 patients who tested positive for SARSCoV-2 during pregnancy. Overall, 10.4% (205/1964) of pregnant women received at least one COVID-19 related drug. Antibiotics (8.6%; 169/1694) were the most frequently used category, followed by corticosteroids (3.2%; 62/1964), antivirals (2.0%; 39/1964), HCQ (1.4%; 27/1964), and anti-IL-6 (0.3%; 5/1964). Among all drug categories, antibiotics represented 56.0%, corticosteroids 20.5%, antivirals 12.9%, HCQ 8.9% and anti-IL-6 1.7% of drugs used. The use of at least one COVID-19 related drug was 3.1% (12/381) in asymptomatic patients, 4.2% (52/1233) in outpatients, 19.7% (46/233) in inpatients without oxygen, 72.1% (44/61) in those requiring standard oxygen, 95.7% (22/23) in those requiring high flow oxygen, 96.2% (25/26) in intubated patients and 57.1% (4/7) among patients who died. The proportion of patients who received at least one drug to treat COVID-19 was higher during the early period than in the late period (16.7% vs. 7.7%).Antibiotics, antivirals, and HCQ had a lower rate of use in the late compared to the early pandemic period. Conclusions: Drug use in pregnant women was associated with disease severity. The use of drugs not recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 has decreased after the emergence of the first scientific evidence. The trend towards increased use of corticosteroids seems to be aligned with the evolution of guidelines. Finally, there is still a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 related drugs in pregnant women, which call for further studies.",1.0,positive,True

3768,"Background: Despite the important role of retail pharmacies in promoting access to contraceptives and abortion products in the community, there is limited information on the availability of contraceptives and abortion products by product type at retail pharmacies in high income and LMICs at the country-level. Objectives: We examine the availability of contraceptives and abortion medications in retail pharmacies for high-income countries (HICs) and LMICs at the country-level before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using quarterly pharmacy retail sales data collected from IQVIATM MIDAS® in 70 countries from January 2015 through September 2020. For each quarter, we report utilization of contraceptives and abortion medications as defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 women and girls of reproductive age (15-49 years) per day. Results: From 2015 to 2020, global contraceptive use declined 5.8% (76.3 DDD to 71.9 DDD). Contraceptive use in HICs was more than eight times greater than in LMICs t(188.8 DDD vs 21.4 DDD). Oral contraceptives and long acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) were substantially higher in HICs compared to LMICs (130.9 DDD vs. 17.2 DDD; and 47.1 DDD vs. 0.7 DDD, respectively). Utilization of LARCs, however, increased significantly in LMICs (214%, from 0.2 DDD to 0.7 DDD; p < 0.01), and emergency contraceptive use remained higher in LMICs compared to HICs. LMICs experienced low contraceptive use across categories over time. India had the lowest contraceptive use over time (6.5 DDD to 7.3 DDD), and West Africa experienced the greatest increase in overall contraceptive use, driven by injectables (352%, 7.7 DDD to 34.9 DDD). Compared to the previous year's quarter, during the first quarter of COVID-19 (Apr-Jun), global contraceptive use declined in all categories except injectables. Abortion products were more common in LMICs compared to HICs; use declined substantially over time in HICs but increased significantly in LMICs (À47.6%, from 2.3 DDD to 1.2 DDD; p < 0.01; and 83.0%, from 3.9 DDD to 7.2 DDD; p < 0.01, respectively). By 2020, Pakistan had the highest abortion medication use followed by Bangladesh (67.0 DDD and 6.4 DDD, respectively). Conclusions: Despite minimal declines in contraceptive utilization and a shift toward LARCs globally, there are persistent disparities between LMICs and HICs. Utilization of abortion medications, however, is persistently higher in LMICs than HICs. Disparities between high income and LMICs in contraceptive may contribute to worsening disparities in reproductive health. Our findings also suggest that LMICs are more likely to rely on abortion medications from retail pharmacies than HICs, which may be related to limited access to contraceptives from the public sector.",1.0,community,True

Objectives: To describe use patterns of UTI-antibiotics and UTI-related hospital admissions up to and after nursing home admission in Denmark. Methods: In a cohort of all Danish residents moving into nursing homes in 2015-2020, supplied with data from the nationwide Danish health care registries, we described prescription patterns, use of UTIantibiotics (pivmecillinam, nitrofurantoin, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin), and hospital admissions related to UTIs in the two years preceding and following nursing home admission. Further, we examined differences in UTI-antibiotic use across the Danish regions, municipalities, and individual nursing homes. Results: The cohort comprised 86 214 residents (61% female; median age 84 years). The most commonly used UTI-antibiotic were pivmecillinam (54%) and trimethoprim (18%). Fifteen percent of all UTI prescriptions was followed by another UTI prescription within 15 days. General practicioners prescribed the majoritiy (86%) of all UTI-antibiotics. UTI antibiotic use doubled prior to nursing home admission from 7 to 14 treatments per 100 residents per month two months prior to admission. Following admission, UTI antibiotic use dropped to 10 treatments per 100 resident per months consistently over the following two years. Overall, women used slightly more UTI antibiotics compared to men, e.g. 15 vs 11 in the month prior to admission. Hospital admissions related to UTIs peaked at three months prior to moving in, with 3 admissions per 100 residents, dropping to 1 admission per 100 residents per month subsequently. We found considerable variation in use of UTI-antibiotics between nursing homes, with ten percent of nursing homes responsible for one third of all UTI treatments in 2020. Conclusions: Use of UTI antibiotics increased prior to and remained at a stable high level during the two-year follow-up after nursing home admission. Most prescriptions were prescribed by general practitioners. Use of UTI-antibiotics showed considerable variation between individual nursing homes.",1.0,,True

Methods: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington has been collating and tracking reported COVID-19 outcomes, projecting the trajectory of the pandemic, and quantifying its toll. Building on this work, we produced estimates of COVID-19 vaccine coverage globally by location, by day since December 1, 2020, and by brand. We included 10 brands in our analysis (CanSinoBio, CoronaVac, Covaxin, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Novavax, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinopharm, and Sputnik V), as well as a residual ""other"" category. We rely on observed brand-specific vaccine uptake data rather than estimated uptake when available. Absent brand-specific uptake data for many locations in the world, we developed a stepwise estimation approach to quantify vaccine uptake as a function of predicted vaccine supply, distribution, and hesitancy. We estimate newly available doses by brand based on purchase agreements, model distribution as a function of location-specific infrastructure and brandspecific abundance, and assume 10% spoilage and 10% drop-out for two-dose series. Results: Between December 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, we estimate that 8 billion doses of vaccine were administered globally, excluding boosters. This includes 2.6 billion, 1.3 billion, and 1.2 billion doses of Sinopharm, Oxford-AstraZeneca, and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, respectively. We estimate that 3.9 billion individuals were fully vaccinated during that period: 571 million with a single dose of Johnson & Johnson; the remaining with two-dose regimens. As of December 31, 2021, we estimate that 806 million had received only a single dose of a two-dose regimen. Of these, we expect only 395 million will complete their series. Conclusions: These estimates of vaccine uptake by brand can be used to inform subsequent analyzes of global impact as well as to identify the size of partially-vaccinated populations globally.",1.0,COVID-19,True

It is critical to track the pattern of use of psychotropic medicines in order to ensure that they are used responsibly. Objectives: To assess the pattern of psychotropic drug utilization among patients with psychiatric illness at tertiary hospital. Methods: A prospective observational study was carried out over a period of nine months. Patients of either gender, above 18 years and diagnosed to have psychiatric disorder were enrolled in the study. Prescriptions were reviewed by the clinical pharmacist during patient's visit at outpatient department of Psychiatry. The demographic details, past medical and family history were collected and documented for further evaluation. Results: A total of 430 patients were enrolled in the study. A majority (57.20%) of them were females and majority were in the age group of 41-50 years. Depression (60%) was the most common diagnosis followed by Bipolar Affective Disorder (21.62%), schizophrenia (2.30%) and Alcohol Dependence Syndrome (6.04%). Quetiapine (62.8%) was the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medication followed amitriptyline (13.22%). Lithium (54.7 %) was observed to have surpassed the use of Valproate (32%) as a mood stabilizer in bipolar affective disorders. Psychotropic medicines were used in accordance with current recommendations and guidelines for various indications.

3814,"Background: There is extensive evidence on benefits of antihypertensive treatment, yet many patients with hypertension do not reach therapy goals. Poor persistence to antihypertensive drug therapy has shown to be an important reason behind treatment failure. No studies on adherence and persistence have been conducted in Lithuania, despite that the country is among those with the highest cardiovascular mortality in Europe. Objectives: To describe the choice of therapy for initiation of antihypertensive treatment, to determine the percentage of patients not being persistent with antihypertensive treatment after one year and to explore factors associated with non-persistence. Methods: In this cohort study, data on dispensed prescription medicines from Lithuanian National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) were used. All prescriptions of hypertensive adult patients that claimed their first prescription in 2018 were included. Initiation of treatment was described by ATC class for monotherapy patients and number of active pharmaceutical ingredients for combination therapy patients. Descriptive statistics were used to present means and frequencies. Non-persistence was assessed using anniversary method at day 365. Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore factors associated with non-persistence. Results: 72088 patients with the diagnosis hypertension (mean age 58 years) received an antihypertensive treatment for the first time in 2018. Of those, 56% started with monotherapy treatment, 49% of them started with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. 44% started with combination therapy. Of combination therapy patients 72% started with two active pharmaceutical ingredients. 57% of patients had discontinued the antihypertensive therapy after one year. 61% of monotherapy patients were non-persistent comparing to 53% of combination therapy patients. Patients gender and prescriber qualification showed no association with persistence. Younger patients, patients whose primary care registration was in rural area, patients started with monotherapy and patients with no medication change had higher odds to become non-persistent. Conclusions: More than half of hypertensive patients were initiated with monotherapy treatment in 2018.

Poison control centers, together with other pharmacoepidemiological sources, can be part of an active surveillance system for monitoring medicine's misuse and drug abuse. Objectives: To characterize calls received by the Portuguese Poison Information Center (CIAV) reporting intentional poisonings involving at least one psychoactive medicine. Methods: Retrospective observational study of intentional exposures to opioid analgesics, antiepileptics, anxiolytics, hypnotics and sedatives, antidepressants, psychostimulants and drugs used in opioid dependence reported to the Portuguese Poison Information Center (CIAV) from 2014 to 2018. The variables studied were demographic characteristics of individuals, geographic distribution of calls, co-exposure to alcohol or illicit drugs, call origin, case evaluation and case guidance. Annual rates of intentional exposure based on census and medicines' use data (sales information from HMR Portugal) were estimated. Results: Between 2014 and 2018, 24 624 calls were received at CIAV reporting 34 203 intentional exposures to any medicinal product, with 20 906 exposures receiving emergency room visit advice or effective hospitalization. In the 23 139 calls reporting intentional poisonings to the 69 psychoactive medicines studied, exposure was combined with alcohol or with illegal drugs in 1918 and 117 calls, respectively. 31 169 (91.1%) intentional exposures involved one of the studied medicines, 76% of which referring to females and 46% to the 35-54 age group. The most frequently involved psychoactive medicines were benzodiazepines (62.0%), leading alprazolam (15.4%, but declining since 2015) and diazepam (12.0%), with trazodone ranking fifth (6.0%). Prescription opioids are quite underrepresented, tramadol appearing first in the 25th position of the ranking. Alprazolam has the highest rate of intentional poisoning (88.2/million inhabitants). However, considering the at-risk population (patients treated with each medicine), the rate of intentional poisoning is higher for diazepam and trazodone (in 2018, 6.12 and 5.77/1000 patients, respectively). Conclusions: Prescription opioids are not frequently reported in intentional poisonings, contrasting with benzodiazepines and antidepressants, the top therapeutic classes involved in poisonings reported to CIAV. Given the fact that both these classes currently account for a large proportion of medicines' consumption in Portugal, morbimortality consequences of their possible misuse should be further studied, in order to minimize the associated risks.",1.0,case,True
3821,"Background: This study describes supply trends of anticoagulants and antiplatelets at United States (US) hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for institutional strategies to manage drug supply in the setting of ongoing shortages. Objectives: The objective of this research was to describe the trends in supply of anticoagulants and antiplatelets at US hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We used IQVIA National Sales Perspective (NSP) monthly projections of the total volume of medications purchased by US hospitals, focusing on anticoagulants and antiplatelets. Medication volume is standardized using extended units (EUs), calculated by multiplying the number of product units or packages by the package size. We calculated the total monthly EUs for predefined drug categories (aspirin, oral anticoagulants, oral antiplatelets, parenteral anticoagulants, parenteral antiplatelets) and specific medications between January 2018 and February 2021. We then determined mean volumes over 3 month periods to account for monthly variations. We also determined the year-over-year (YoY) change in supply by comparing the volume in a period in a given year with the volume in the same period of the previous year. Volumes were compared between the COVID-19 pandemic period (April 2020 onward) and the prepandemic period (March 2020 and earlier). These dates aligned with the US declaration of a national emergency in March 2020. Results: At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a 43.7% decline in the total volume of anticoagulants and antiplatelets at US hospitals between March 2020 and April 2020, falling from approximately 450 million EUs to 255 million EUs. The 3 month average total volume in the period prior the pandemic (January 2020 - March 2020) was 403 million EUs (95% CI: 299 million - 507 million), which fell to 318 million EUs (95% CI: 234 million - 403 million) in the 3 months after, representing a 21.1% decline. The 3 month average total volume subsequently increased 27.6% and 6.7%, respectively, in the subsequent periods. The YoY change in supply was negative for aspirin (À27.5%), oral anticoagulants (À4.6%), oral antiplatelets (À20.3%), parenteral anticoagulants (À23.1%), and parenteral antiplatelets (À37.0%) from April 2020 through June 2020. While YoY change became positive for oral (8.8%) and parenteral anticoagulants (11.9%) by the year end, it remained negative for aspirin (À14.0%), oral antiplatelets (À0.7%), and parenteral antiplatelets (À11.5%). Conclusions: Though the onset of COVID-19 pandemic corresponded to a decrease in antithrombotic supply at US hospitals, volume returned to prepandemic levels.

Objectives: To gain insight into the prescription patterns of inhalation medication in asthma patients in clinical practice. Methods: This observational study identified new asthma patients aged 16 years, based on first prescription of short- or long-acting beta-agonists (SABA or LABA), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), or a combination thereof (ICS+LABA), from the University of Groningen IADB. nl prescription database between 1994 and 2021. Treatment steps were defined as follows: 1: use of SABA or ICS-formoterol as needed, 2: low dose ICS, 3: low dose ICS plus LABA or intermediate dose ICS only, 4: intermediate to high dose ICS plus LABA, or high dose ICS only, 5: referral to a specialist. Patients' treatment steps and switches thereof were determined over time, using dosage and time-varying proportion of days covered when necessary. Patterns were compared for gender, age and relevant comorbidities. Sensitivity analyzes will be performed by excluding possible COPD cases. Results: We identified 64056 patients.

Methods: In this validation study, the drug treatment of 302 consecutive primary care patients was analyzed (65-99 years; 59% female; treated with 0-20 (median: 6) drugs). PIMs/PPOs concordantly identified by two specialist physicians, in retrospect after a planned physician visit, using three European PIM/PPO criteria sets, were included. As gold standard, the physicians in consensus categorized the drug treatment as adequate or inadequate, the latter implying that additional action related to the medication could be medically justified prior to the next regular visit. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for PIMs/PPOs according to the three criteria sets to identify inadequate drug treatment were calculated, as well as sensitivity/specificity. Results: According to the STOPP/START criteria, the EU(7)-PIM list, and the Swedish indicators of prescribing quality, 0-8, 0-6, and 0-12 PIMs/PPOs per patient, respectively, were identified. In all, the drug treatment of 98 (32%) patients was categorized as inadequate, most often due to a need for more medical information to enable decision making about initiation/withdrawal of a specific drug. The areas under the ROC curve for the three criteria sets were 0.60 (95% confidence interval: 0.53-0.66), 0.69 (0.63-0.75), and 0.73 (0.67-0.80), respectively.

Methods: We conducted a population-based observational study using the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System (QICDSS). Between 2002 and 2018, we identified Quebec residents (>,""14 years) insured with the provincial drug plan with a first diagnosis of cluster B PD recorded in the QICDSS (since 1996). We retrieved all the claims for main psychiatric drug classes (antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders [ADHD] medications) in the year before and after PD diagnosis. We calculated the proportion of individuals exposed to the different medication classes and, for each class, the mean number and mean days' supply of medications used. Results were presented according to the year of PD diagnosis to investigate prescription trends and by sex. Results: Between 2002 and 2018, we identified 87 778 new cases of cluster B PD patients, with a mean age of 44.8 years (standard deviation: 19.5) and 57.5% women. The most prevalent psychiatric comorbidities were depression (50.9%), anxiety (49.7%), and psychotic disorders (37.5%). Most patients (71.0%) received at least one psychiatric medication in the year before PD diagnosis, and 78.5% received these drugs in the subsequent year. Similarly, the proportion of users increased for antidepressants (51.6-54.7%), antipsychotics (35.9% 45.2%), mood stabilizers (14.8%-17.0%), and ADHD medications (5.1%-5.9%), and remained relatively stable for anxiolytics (41.4%41.7%). Trends showed increased use of antipsychotics and ADHD medications during the study period, while anxiolytics and mood stabilizers decreased, and antidepressants remained stable. Women used psychiatric medications more frequently, with differences according to drug classes. Conclusions: Psychiatric medication use is highly prevalent among cluster B PD patients, even in the absence of evidence-based""",1.0,Cluster,True

3863,"Background: Although multimodal management of chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) is recommended, long-term medicine and health service utilization among people using opioids for CNCP is not well known. Objectives: This study aimed to describe 12-month and 30-day use of medicines and health services for pain over four years; and determine associations between 30-day use and sociodemographic and pain characteristics. Methods: The Pain and Opioids IN Treatment (POINT) study included 1514 Australian adults receiving opioids for CNCP for more than six weeks. Medicines (opioid and non-opioid analgesics, psychotropic medicines) and services (physical, mental health, specialized) used in the previous 12-months and 30-days were collected annually over four years (2015-2018). Associations were explored between 30-day treatment use and sociodemographic characteristics and pain measures using mixed-effects logistic regression models. Multiple imputation using chained equations was conducted to reduce bias from missing data. Results: Overall, 1334 participants completed at least one annual follow-up (median age 57 years, interquartile range (IQR) 48-67, 56% female). Median pain severity (5.0, interquartile range (IQR) 3.8-6.3) and pain interference scores (5.7, IQR 3.9-7.3) indicated moderate pain throughout the study period. Most participants reported use of medicines (12-month: 97.6%; 30-day: 96.8%) and services (12-month: 91.8%; 30-day: 66.1%). Some treatment use was not consistent with guidelines: ongoing use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and sedative-hypnotics was common, as was gabapentinoid use for nonneuropathic pain, while fewer people engaged with specialist pain management programs (12-month: 22.3%). Private health insurance was associated with using physical (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.59, 99.5% confidence intervals (CI) 1.15-2.22) and specialized services (aOR 1.47, 99.5% CI 1.14-1.91), but not medicine use. Conclusions: Many people taking opioids long-term for CNCP also use other treatments. Medicines were used more frequently and consistently than non-pharmacological treatments. Pain severity remained high, suggesting current treatment models may be insufficient, and access to effective pain management remains a significant problem for many patients.",1.0,,True

Objectives: We explored user-reported use patterns, indications, and adverse effects of analgesics in a Danish community pharmacy survey. Methods: We conducted a survey in eight community pharmacies across Denmark. Pharmacy staff invited persons aged 18 years redeeming prescriptions for analgesics or requesting analgesics over the counter (OTC) to participate in the study. The survey included questions about type of analgesics, on-label and self-reported indications and dosage, and self-reported adverse effects when using analgesics. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 2410 participants completed the survey; 68% were female and 50% were above 60 years old. Most participants (61%) filled a prescription for paracetamol followed by non-steroidal analgesics (NSAIDs; 23%). Overall, 73% had an analgesic prescribed for daily use, while 61% reported daily use of their medication, and 35% of all participants reported using analgesics ""as needed"". Among participants using OTC analgesics, 17% reported using their medication daily. The majority of all prescriptions (80%) was labeled with the standardized indication ""against pain"", while self-reported indications were most commonly back pain (31%) and muscle/joint pain (18%). The most common self-reported indications among participants using OTC analgesics were headache and muscle/joint pain with 38% and 19%, respectively. Finally, we found that 90% of all participants reported not experiencing adverse effects when using analgesics. Conclusions: A considerable proportion of participants used analgesics differently than prescribed, while almost one-fifth of participants requesting OTC analgesics used their medication daily. The majority of all prescriptions for analgesics have the standardized phrase ""against pain"" on the drug label rather than a specific indication.

Objectives: To describe underlying reasons for PIMs/PPOs according to some STOPP/START criteria that were completely discordantly identified by two general practitioners (GPs). Methods: This descriptive study was based on PIM/PPO assessments, by two GPs according to STOPP/START version 2 based on information in the medical records, performed in a study investigating the clinical relevance of PIMs/PPOs as well as the adequacy of drug treatment in 302 consecutive, older, primary care patients (65-99 years; 59% female, median: 6 drugs in the medication list).

Methods: In this longitudinal trends study, we used pharmaceutical sales data from IQVIA's MIDAS. We analyzed quarterly sales data for mental illness medicines between January first 2015 to October 3first 2020. Medicines for mental ilness were defined as antidepressants and mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, anxyiolytics, hypnotics, sedatives and anti-epileptics. For each specific medicine, we also determine whether it is included on the current WHO essential medicines list (EML). Population estimates for each country and region were based on the UN World Population Prospects 2019 report. Average quarterly sales trends of mental illnes medicines were expressed as defined daily doses (DDDs) per 100 000 inhabitants per day. Results: In LMICs, the availability of medicines for mental illness increased from 1337 DDDs per 100 000 persons per day in January to March of 2015 to 1967 DDDs by October 2020, corresponding to a 47% relative increase and was largely driven by the growth of antidepressants and mood stabilizers (477 DDDs vs 807 DDDs; p < 0.001) and typical antipsychotics (89 DDDs vs. 155 DDDs; p < 0.001). During this time period, only 41% of mental health medicines overall were designated as WHO essential medicines, and only one-third of antipsychotics. The availability of mental health medicines varied substantially across regions and countries, ranging from 78 DDDs per 100 000 persons in Vietnam to 15 265 DDDs per 100 000 persons in Croatia in 2019. The most pronunced increases were observed in Ukraine (from 404 DDDs per-capita in 2015 to 823 DDDs per-capita in 2020) and Brazil (from 3985 DDDs to 7577 DDDs). There was no measurable impact of COVID-19 on the availability of mental health drugs in 2020. Conclusions: Access to mental health medicines has steadily increased in LMICs over a 5 year period, yet there is substantial disparities within regions and between countries, including those with growing mental health burden. Efforts to increase access to mental health medicines should consider expanding the EMLs list to include approved agents increasingly used for the treatment of mental illness, particularly typical antipsychotics.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Methods: Using EHR data from a National Cancer Institutedesignated comprehensive cancer center, we identified LC patients diagnosed between 1/2011-6/2021 and underwent genomic sequence testing. We identified NSCLC patients and categorized use of ICIs including pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab and durvalumab into 1) first-line (given ICI alone or in combination), and 2) second/later-line therapy. We identified demographics and comorbidities. We described prevalence of NSCLC and trend of ICI use as first-line therapy over each year. We used logistic regression to predict first-line ICI use with predictors age, gender, race, ethnicity, and comorbidities in NSCLC patients. Results: Among 2231 lung cancer patients, 82% (1829) were NSCLC. Among 1829 NSCLC patients (mean age 67, 47% male, 67% nonHispanic White), 12% (216) patients received ICI alone or in combination with chemotherapy with pembrolizumab as the most common agent (84%). The use of ICI in NSCLC has increased from 3% (2011) to 15% (2015), 24% (2018) and as high as 33% (2020). Among 216 ICI users (mean age 66, 44% male, 73% non-Hispanic White, 42% hypertension, 16% diabetes, 9% hypothyroidism and 3% autoimmune comorbidity), 38% received ICI as the first line therapy. In multivariate logistic regression for ICI users, hypertension (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.7) and older age >66 (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36-0.78) predicted lower first-line ICI use. Conclusions: ICI use has increased dramatically after 2015. The observed increase in the ICI use followed FDA's approval of ICIs in 2015 for metastatic NSCLC with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. However, its use as the first-line is still limited to < 40 % of NSCLC patients. Hypertension and older age predicted lower ICI use as the first-line therapy.

We further required patients to have continuous health plan enrollment in the twelve months after the index date. Utilization patterns of prescription opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), gabapentinoids, duloxetine, skeletal muscle relaxants, total knee replacement (TKR), and total hip replacement (THR) surgeries were assessed over calendar time using the twelve months after the index date for each patient. We also quantified the total morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) available per patient in each calendar year. Results: We identified a total of 335 705 patients with hip or knee OA during the study period. The mean age on the index date was 72 years (standard deviation: 7 years), and 59% were female. Prescription opioid use remained relatively constant from 28% in 2005 to 24% in 2012, then declined sharply over time to 9% in 2019; total opioid dosage per patient also decreased from 1328 MMEs to 1036 MMEs over the same period.

Methods: All person-years (PYs) exposed to dabigatran from January 2015 to December 2020 were calculated from recordlinkage claims database, using defined daily doses to estimate the duration of each dispensation. Idarucizumab use was identified from inpatients and/or emergency care, and incidence rate was calculated over PYs of dabigatran use. To identify patients treated with idarucizumab, emergency visits and hospital discharge records were probabilistically linked to dabigatran users, matching date and ward of admission.

Subsequently, each association between idarucizumab administration and hospitalization/emergency visit was ranked as (1) probable, (2) possible, (3) incompatible, (4) non assessable. Linked users were described in terms of indication and followed-up for 30 days to assess mortality. Results: During the study period, 49 134 PYs of dabigatran use were observed, and 249 administrations of idarucizumab were recorded, corresponding to 5.1 (95% CI: 4.5-5.7) per 1000 PYs.

Studies have shown concurrent use of conventional and herbal medicines in diabetes management, but data on this is often missing due to lack of tools that can report the simultaneous use. Objectives: This study sought to develop, test and validate a virtual tool that collected diabetic patients' medical and medication history including the herbal medicine, to be used to improve patient outcomes. Methods: A virtual tool that collated patients' socio-demographic, medical and medication data was developed and tested by pharmacists and medical practitioners for usability. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were recruited and interviewed about the use of herbal medicine as well as their opinions on usability of the tool. Data was analyzed descriptively. Ethical approval was sought from Kenyatta National Hospital/ University of Nairobi Ethics Review Committee. Results: A virtual medical and medication tool was developed and validated during the study. Eighteen patients were recruited to test the tool, most of whom were men (10, 56%) and above 50 years (10, 56%). Type 2 diabetes was the most abundant with 61% experiencing at least one or more comorbidities, with elevated blood pressure being the most common (9, 50%). 89% (n ,"" 16) patients were using herbal medicine, with ginger, garlic and thorn melon combination being commonly used (22%).

3914,"Introduction: Long-term persistence with statin treatment represents a basic precondition of successful secondary prevention in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients. The aims of our study were: a) to analyze non-persistence with statins, and b) to identify patient- and medication-related characteristics associated with nonpersistence. Methods: Our study cohort (n ,"" 13763) included patients treated with statins in whom PAD was newly diagnosed between 1 January and 31 December 2012. The database of the General Health Insurance Company represented a source of data for our study. Patients were followed for five years. Patients with at least six months without any statin prescription were defined as non-persistent patients. To analyze characteristics associated with non-persistence, the Cox proportional hazards model was applied. Results: At the end of the 5-year follow-up, 5743 (41.7%) patients were found to be non-persistent. Increasing age, history of ischemic stroke, diabetes mellitus, high intensity statin treatment, general practitioner as index prescriber, increasing overall number of medications, and administration of certain cardiovascular medications represented factors associated with a decreased probability of non-persistence. On the contrary, female sex, university education, simvastatin or rosuvastatin as initially administered statins, being a new statin user, and increasing patient´s co-payment were associated with an increased likelihood of discontinuation of statin treatment. Conclusions: In non-persistent patients, special attention should be paid to improving their adherence to medications.""",1.0,disease,True

3918,"Objectives: The overall aim is to apply time-series change detection methods towards testing effectiveness of RMM, to a) determine the effect of known interventions/changes specified a priori, and b) detect plausible changes in a data-driven manner, not pre-specified a priori. Methods: Study Design: Cohort study conducted within the OHDSI international federated data network. Study Population: · Cohort 1: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and on treatment with HCQ and dexamethasone (DXM), from January to October 2020. · Cohort 2: Patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and on treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), from 2000 to 2018. · Cohort 3: Patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and on treatment with dexamethasone (DXM), from 2000 to 2018. Data Sources: Three databases mapped to the OHDSI OMOP Common Data Model, namely IQVIA Open Claims (USA) and IQVIA Hospital (USA), and THIN (UK). Statistical Analysis: Two change detection approaches were included: segmented regression (linear and Poisson), and Bayesian online changepoint detection. All analyzes were conducted in R version 4.0.0. Results: Cohort 1 A change point followed by a downward trend was detected in HCQ use time-series between 2008 and 2012, potentially explained by the decline in HCQ use following RA guidelines recommend using Methotrexate as first line therapy from 2008. Cohort 2 A change point followed by a downward trend was detected in HCQ use time-series between March and April 2020, potentially explained by the decline in HCQ use following the April 2020 regulatory action by EMA and WHO due to cardiovascular safety issues. Cohort 3 A change point followed by an upward trend was detected in DXM use time-series in June 2020, potentially explained by the June 2020 Recovery RCT report confirming 30% reduction in mortality. Conclusions: Change detection methods were used to study changes in the use of a given drug over time in a data-driven manner. The application was demonstrated through three real-world examples. The proposed RMM effectiveness testing approach is available as an interactive web app where researchers/regulators/policymakers can select their drug, cohort, and time period of interest, and view the estimated changes in these data over time.

Using these data, we emailed a four-item Qualtrics survey to galcanezumab prescribers (n ,"" 601) for whom email addresses were available. Reminders were sent on a weekly basis. The survey was available from October 26 through December 21, 2021. Results: After 50 undeliverable emails, we reached an estimated 551 providers and received 70 survey responses (response rate: 13%). Of 65 prescribers who completed the survey, 40 (62%) had received sample packs provided by the manufacturer explicitly for loading doses (the manufacturer does not promote the use of samples for anything beyond the loading dose). Of those, 97% responded that they provided sample packs for the loading dose and 56% responded that they provided the sample packs for doses beyond the loading dose. Most providers (62%) indicated that sample pack administration is routinely recorded in the electronic medical record (EMR). Conclusions: Medication samples were given to patients, including for doses beyond the loading dose. Drug samples not recorded in claims can lead to exposure misclassification in claims-based pharmacoepidemiology studies. Patients who do not fill a prescription after receiving a sample, possibly due to adverse events, intolerability, lack of effectiveness, long-lasting effectiveness, or cost are not identifiable in claims. Use of samples beyond the initial dose will also appear as nonexposure in claims studies, affecting assessment of safety, adherence, and cost. Although medical records may contain data on samples, not all providers indicated that they record samples in their EMR, indicating that even medical records data may not be sufficient to capture all samples. Claims- or medical record-based studies of medications should explore the impact of sample utilization and consider incorporating quantitative bias and other sensitivity analyzes into the study protocol.""",1.0,epidemiology,True

Methods: We used national coronial data linked with medicine dispensing claims for all people who died by suicide in Australia (2013- 2019). We used a data-driven approach to identify structural breaks (breakpoints) in linear regression models of weekly dispensing and initiation rates for all medicines over time. Results: Our study included 14 344 people (24% female, median age 44 years). In the year prior to death, women were more likely than men to be dispensed antidepressants (62% [n , 2164] vs 42% [n ,"" 4535]), benzodiazepines (46% [n "", 1600] vs 29% [n ,"" 3126]), and antipsychotics (26% [n "", 892] vs 17% [n ,"" 1814]). For antidepressants, the dispensing rate increased by 0.3% per week (95% CI 0.2%-0.4%) until a breakpoint 15 weeks prior to death, when it started increasing by 1.8% per week (95% CI 1.5%-2.1%). For benzodiazepines, dispensing increased by 0.4% per week (95% CI 0.4%0.5%) until 9 weeks prior to death, increasing to 4.8% per week (95% CI 4.1%-5.6%) after. For antipsychotics, dispensing increased by 0.2% per week (95% CI 0.1%-0.4%) until 23 weeks prior to death, increasing to 1.0% per week (95% CI 0.8%-1.3%) after. In the 6 months prior to death, treatment-naïve women were more likely than men to initiate antidepressants (26.2% [n "", 523] vs 18.4% [n ,"" 1553]), benzodiazepines (21.4% [n "", 568] vs 15.2% [n ,"" 1479]), and antipsychotics (9.9% [n "", 293] vs 6.0% [n ,"" 596]). Breakpoints in the weekly rate of initiation of antidepressants and benzodiazepines were observed at approximately 3 months prior to death, and 4 weeks prior to death. In the 4 weeks prior to death, the initiation rate increased rapidly by 16.2% per week (95% CI 5.0%-28.5%) for antidepressants and 18.2% (95% CI 9.9%-27.4%) per week for benzodiazepines. The initiation rate was highest the week prior to death for both medicine classes. No breakpoint was observed in antipsychotic initiation over time. Similar patterns of change were observed for men and women. Conclusions: Women who died by suicide were more likely to be dispensed psychotropic medicines than men. In both sexes, dispensing and initiation increased more rapidly closer to the date of death, with benzodiazepine initiation seeing the most dramatic changes in the month before death.

Methods: This retrospective, observational study analyzed claims data from the IBM® MarketScan® Commercial and Multi-State Medicaid Databases. Individuals aged 18-64 years with 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient claims for SZ or BD diagnoses during the year preceding the analysis years 2015-2019 were included, with age- and sex-matched controls. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and medication use were assessed. Opioid dispensing was defined as chronic (70 days over a 90-day period or 6 prescriptions annually) or nonchronic (1 prescription, chronic definition not met during an analysis year). Results: In 2019, the Commercial and Medicaid databases contained 4773 and 30 179 patients with SZ and 52 780 and 63 455 patients with BD, respectively.

While various guidelines have emerged to aid decision making on anticoagulation (AC) use for COVID-19 infection, they are based on limited and inconsistent evidence. With the emergence of COVID-19 variants, their effect on hypercoagulability is also unknown. Objectives: To describe anticoagulation utilization over time and its predictors among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a multi-institutional electronic health record (EHR) repository in the United States. We identified hospitalized COVID-19 patients between 4/1/2020-1/31/2022. We categorized AC (enoxaparin, heparin, or direct oral anticoagulant) use into 3 groups - no use, standard prophylaxis (SP), or treatment dose (TD) - and assessed use over calendar time. We also evaluated utilization patterns over time among subgroups defined by low (Ddimer < 1 mcg/ml), medium (D-dimer  1 mcg/ml and platelet < 50 000/mcl), and high (D-dimer  1 mcg/ml and platelet  50 000/ mcl) thromboembolic risk. Results: Among 141 661 COVID-19 patients (median age 57, 49% male, and median BMI 30) from 25 institutions, 66% received some level of AC, with 42% and 24% on SP and TD, respectively. From 4/2020 to 11/2021, the rate of AC was stable over time at around 65%; from 12/2021 to 1/2022, there was a significant decrease in AC use to 47% (p < 0.001). A length of stay (LOS) > 7 days was associated with a 56% increase in AC utilization compared to LOS  7 days (p < 0.001). Prior to 12/2021, average LOS was 8.6 days compared to 5.6 days after. Out of 53 927 patients stratified by thromboembolic risk, 16%, 26%, and 43% with low, medium, and high risk received TD, respectively. In the high risk group, 84% received any type of AC, and those with a longer LOS (> 7 days) had a higher AC utilization rate (p < 0.001). Compared to 25% of non-high risk patients receiving TD, 43% of high risk patients received TD (p < 0.001). TD rate dropped to 35% after 12/2021 from 44% prior while the percentage of high risk patients remained unchanged. Conclusions: Two thirds of COVID patients received some level of AC. While trends in AC utilization remained stable over the first 1.5 years since the pandemic, after 12/2021 during the Omicron variant surge in the United States, AC use reduced by 35%, which was accompanied by decreased LOS. High thromboembolic risk status and longer LOS predicted higher AC use at therapeutic dose.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has now approved factor Xa inhibitors for NVAF patients, which are rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Objectives: To explore the utilization patterns of factor Xa inhibitors and warfarin in obese NVAF patients based on insurance coverage. Methods: A retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records in the US from June 1, 2012, to December 14, 2020, was performed. Obese individuals who had a NVAF diagnosis with their first prescription of rivaroxaban, apixaban, or warfarin were included. Patients with any valve disease, transient atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, pregnancy, or those who had knee or hip replacement surgery less than six weeks earlier were excluded. The total number of prescriptions for each factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban and apixaban) and warfarin was calculated by adding the number of each prescription based on insurance coverage (Medicaid, Medicare, private, and other). Results: The estimated average percentage of patients aged 65 years or older across all three cohorts was 65.33%. The total number of oral anticoagulant prescriptions (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and warfarin) was 591 among the Medicare population. This number includes 214 people who were using warfarin, 198 people who were using apixaban, and 179 people who were using rivaroxaban. The total number of Medicaid coverage for apixaban, rivaroxaban, and warfarin prescriptions was similar, showing 22, 25, and 20, respectively. People who carried private insurance showed similar utilization of rivaroxaban (86 prescriptions) and apixaban (86 prescriptions) compared to warfarin (57 prescriptions). Among patients with other insurance coverage, the highest total number of prescriptions was 18 for apixaban, followed by 16 for warfarin, and six for rivaroxaban. Conclusions: The utilization of apixaban, rivaroxaban, and warfarin by obese NVAF patients was higher in the group with Medicare coverage than in groups with other types of coverage.

3959,"Background: Riluzole was the first disease-modifying drug authorized for the treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) in Italy. Therapeutic indications for riluzole limit its use to patients without specific contraindications. Furthermore, the drug is not indicated for motor neuron diseases other than ALS (o-MND). Objectives: Our first objective was to describe riluzole use in ALS patients with contraindications to its use and the second objective was to describe off-label riluzole use among patients with o-MND in the Italian regions of Lazio, Tuscany, and Umbria. Methods: Objective 1: a cohort of adults prescribed riluzole for the first time (index date) during the years 2016-2019 and with a previously recorded ALS diagnosis was constructed using the regional administrative healthcare databases. Patients with o-MND recorded in the 5 years before the index date were excluded. Contraindications considered at index date were: being affected by ALS for more than 5 years, presence of tracheotomy, and renal or hepatic failure in the 5 years before the index date. Objective 2: for the analysis of off-label use, a cohort of patients with o-MND diagnosis in 2016-2019 was enrolled and followed for up to 4 years on riluzole use. Prevalence of riluzole use was analyzed stratified by sex, Italian region, and over person time. Results: Objective 1: the study population included 206 ALS patients prescribed riluzole in Lazio, 336 in Tuscany, and 60 in Umbria. Less than 1% had a recorded history of ALS of more than 5 years. Less than 2% had undergone tracheotomy or were affected by hepatic failure. Renal failure was documented for 1.9%, 2.7%, and 5.0% of ALS patients in Lazio, Tuscany, and Umbria, respectively. Objective 2: the o-MND cohort comprised 264 patients in Lazio, 222 in Tuscany, and 66 in Umbria. Off-label riluzole use was observed, with differences between regions and sexes. Prevalence of riluzole use were 8.5% in females, 19.9% in males in Lazio, 33.0% in females, 26.5% in males in Tuscany and 4.2% in females and 2.4% in males in Umbria. Prevalence of riluzole use was stable over time, except in Tuscany, where some fluctuation was registered, ranging between 17.9% and 34.4% for males and 26.7% and 50.0% for females. Conclusions: Riluzole use in ALS patients in the presence of contraindications is rare in the 3 Italian regions, with slightly greater use in the presence of renal failure, especially in Umbria. Off-label riluzole use in o-MND was found to be non-negligible, with variations between sexes and regions. Our observations may be partially explained by the lack of specific disease modifying medications in o-MND, on differences between regional health policies.",1.0,disease,True

Objectives: This study aimed to determine the profile of statin usage in post-myocardial infarction patients in a general hospital in Banjarmasin during 2016-2020, as a whole and based on age, gender, hypercholesterolemia, and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) management. Methods: This was a descriptive drug utilization study with data sources from medical records of myocardial infarction patients in a general hospital in Banjarmasin during 2016-2020. The profile of statin usage, both for the whole statins and based on statin intensity and patient characteristics, during 2016-2020 was analyzed descriptively and shown in the forms of tables and graphs. Results: The subjects of this study were 887 patients, with most of the patients were less than 75 years old (94.8%) and males (77.3%). Results showed that the proportion of statin usage in post-myocardial infarction patients during 2016-2020 was 78.2%, with the highest use in 2017 (82.3%) and the lowest in 2016 (73.3%). The intensity of statins used was low and moderate, with an increasing use of moderate-intensity statins was observed with the advancing years. Based on patient characteristics, those aged 18-74 years (78.5%), having prior hypercholesterolemia (100%), and PCI therapy (89.8%) were more likely to receive statin therapy, while gender category did not tend to be associated with differences in statin usage. Conclusions: It can be concluded that not every post-myocardial infarction patient in a general hospital in Banjarmasin during 2016- 2020 received statin therapy, and age category, previous hypercholesterolemia, and previous PCI therapy tended to be associated with the differences in statin usage.",0.0,,False

Objectives: To evaluate antibacterial utilization in a tertiary hospital setting at Koç University Hospital (KUH), to encourage prudent use of antibacterials in Turkey, and to highlight the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the rational use of antibacterials. Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive study was retrospectively conducted with data extracted from KUH CP inpatient order system and was carried out for a period of one year. Antibacterial utilization of adult (aged18 years) inpatients, who were prescribed at least one type of systemic antibacterial (ATC code J01), was evaluated using the recommended parameter DDD/100 admission and compared between 6 months before COVID-19 and during COVID-19 periods. March 11, 2020, the very first COVID-19 diagnosed case in Turkey, was set as the cutoff date of the 6-month period for the selection of the compared antibacterials using the DU90% method. Results: Finally, 3280 of 5942 and 2605 of 4942 prescriptions for pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods were included, respectively. Antibacterial utilization according to DDD/100 admissions increased from 193.96 to 201.26 DDD/100 admissions after the initiation of COVID-19 pandemic. The most utilized antibacterials were piperacillin and enzyme inhibitors in pre-COVID-19 period, whereas meropenem was utilized the most during COVID-19 period.

Methods: We conducted a time series trend analysis using publicly reported data from the Florida state Medicaid enrollment files and the Medicaid State Drug Utilization Database. Buprenorphine medications (single agent and buprenorphine/naloxone combination products) with OUD indications were identified via National Drug Codes and aggregated to total prescriptions in Florida Medicaid per quarter. Monthly Florida Medicaid enrollment for those aged 18 and older were averaged to quarterly enrollment. The quarterly measure was constructed as total prescriptions reimbursed per 10 000 adult enrollees from quarter 1 (Q1) 2016 to Q1 2021. Joinpoint regression was used to identify significant shift points (joinpoints) in the trend via Monte Carlo Permutation method. Measures were log-transformed to calculate Quarter percent changes (QPC) between joinpoints. Results: A total of 202 732 buprenorphine prescriptions were reimbursed during the study period, ranging from 33 prescriptions/10 000 enrollees in Q1 2016 to 73 prescriptions/10 000 enrollees in Q1 2021. A single significant joinpoint was identified in Q2 2019, where the QPC , 4.51% for the first period (prior to the joinpoint break) and QPC ,"" 0.77% for the second period (following the joinpoint break). The weighted average QPC was 3.4% throughout the study period, meaning there was an average increase in 3.4% prescriptions/10 000 enrollees during each quarter evaluated. The timing of the break aligns with the addition of new buprenorphine generic formulations in this state's covered drug list in early 2019. Conclusions: There was an increase in overall buprenorphine use in every quarter of the study period. Despite multiple policy reimbursement changes aimed at increasing buprenorphine accessibility in the Florida Medicaid program during the study period, we only identified a single significant break in the trend likely associated with formulary changes. Earlier policies related to reimbursement (e.g., removal of prior authorization requirements in Q1 2018) were not associated with significant deviations on increasing utilization trends.""",0.0,,False

Percentages of patients with prescriptions/administrations for therapies mentioned in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) treatment guidelines for adults were computed. Outcomes of interest included length of stay (LOS), gross charges, discharge disposition, and inpatient mortality. Results were stratified by treatment setting. Results: A total of 3526 patients (51% female, 50% ages  10 years, 50%/27%/22% White/Black/Other) diagnosed in the outpatient/ observation (OP; 32%), emergency department (ED; 53%), inpatient (IP; 8%), and unspecified (UN; 7%) settings were included. Aside from remdesivir, which was administered to 20% of patients in the IP setting, other antiviral therapy use was negligible. COVID-19 antibody products were used in < 10% of patients across all settings. Dexamethasone was used in 31%/7%/2% of patients in the IP/ED/OP settings. Adjunctive vitamin and antithrombotic therapies were given to 18% and 11% of patients, respectively, in the IP setting. Mean (median) LOS was 1.6 days (1 day) and gross charges were $16 979 ($1758).

Conclusions: These results help provide insights into real-world hospital experience of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Observed treatment patterns in children generally aligned with the NIH guidelines for adults. As expected, most therapies were prescribed/administered in the IP setting, followed by the ED and OP settings. Outcome metrics of LOS, gross charges, and inpatient mortality were more favorable than those regularly reported among adult populations.

Objectives: To examine 5-year trajectories of opioid use from the time of opioid initiation and the individual characteristics associated with different trajectories of use. Methods: A population-based cohort study of people initiating prescription opioids (2003-2018) in New South Wales, Australia, linked to a range of healthcare datasets [POPPY II Cohort]. We used groupbased trajectory modeling to determine trajectories of monthly opioid use over 60-months from the date of first opioid initiation. Characteristics of individuals within each trajectory including sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, hospitalizations, psychotropic and analgesic medicine use, and type of initial opioid use, were identified. Results: We identified five trajectories of long-term opioid use among 3 474 490 individuals: two involved very low (74%) or low use (18%), one involved sustained use (3%), one involved moderate decreasing to low use (3%), and one involved low increasing to moderate use (3%). Individuals in the three moderate or sustained opioid use trajectories were older, with more co-morbidities and hospitalizations prior to their first opioid initiation, had higher rates of use of other psychotropic and analgesic medicines, and were initiated on stronger opioids. Conclusions: Most individuals had relatively low use of opioids over a five-year period. Individuals with sustained or increasing use were older with more co-morbidities and medicine use, likely reflecting a higher prevalence of pain and treatment needs in these individuals.",1.0,,True

Objectives: To evaluate the impact of CV comorbidities on overall survival (OS) and CV safety in older mCRC patients treated with bevacizumab as a first-line therapy. Methods: A 2009-2015 cohort of mCRC patients 65 years initiating bevacizumab as a first-line therapy was extracted from the French healthcare insurance system claims database (Système National des Données de Santé). At baseline, heart failure, hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and venous/arterial thrombosis have been identified through existing algorithms. 3-year OS has been described using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the impact of baseline CV comorbidities on 3-year OS evaluated using a time-dependent multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. 3-year cumulative incidence of the same CV events and the impact of baseline CV comorbidities on their 3-year occurrence have been evaluated using Fine & Gray models considering death as competing risk. Results: 9222 patients were included: 56.4% male, median age 73 years [IQR 68-78], hypertension 63.5%, heart failure 3.6%, pulmonary embolism 1.5%, stroke 1.3%, myocardial infarction 1.3%, and venous/arterial thrombosis 8.4%.

Heart failure was the comorbidity that shortened the most the median OS (À4.3 months). In multivariable analyzes, none of the CV comorbidities was associated with a higher risk of death unlike age 75, Activities of Daily Living (ADL)-dependency, radiotherapy and initiation of another targeted therapy during follow-up. At 3 years, CV events had occured respectively in 60.2% [58.9; 61.4] and 44.1% [42.3; 45.9] of patients with and without CV comorbidities. Venous thrombosis at baseline was associated with a higher risk of CV events as well as female gender, 3 CV medications at baseline, initiation of another targeted therapy and 7 bevacizumab injections during follow-up. When excluding hypertension from CV events, heart failure, and arterial thrombosis at baseline were also associated with a higher risk of CV events. Conclusions: CV comorbidities before bevacizumab initiation in older mCRC patients had a clear impact on the occurrence of CV events but few on OS. If judged beneficial, older patients with CV comorbidities should be treated with bevacizumab under a close monitoring. Attention should be paid to CV comorbidities impacting the patients' autonomy, especially heart failure.""",1.0,,True

We varied the time frame allowed between claims from 12 to 24 months. The gold standard used was depression assessed through a structured interview based on selfreported symptoms aligned with DSM-IV criteria during the ESAServices study. The interview data were linked to the RAMQ health databases. We computed many algorithms' sensibility, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. Results: The prevalence of depression was 14.73% based on the ESAServices definition and 22.21% according to our most efficient algorithm, defined as follows: 1 ICD-10 hospitalization code for depression (F320, F321, F322, F323, F328, F329, F330, F328, F329, F331, F332, F333, F334, F338, F339), or 1 ICD-9 diagnostic code for depression (311, 3090, 3091, 3119, 3004, 3011, 296, 3092), or 1 American Hospital Formulary Service (AHFS) code for antidepressant claims (AHF281604, AHF283632). Sensibility was 44.3% (95% Confident interval (CI): 38.0-50.5), specificity was 78.6% (95% CI: 76.4-80.7), positive predictive value was 26.3% (95% CI: 22.0-30.5), and negative predictive value was 89.1% (95% CI: 87.4-90.8). The agreement between the algorithm and the structured interview was low, with a kappa of 0.18 (95% CI: 0.13-0.22).

Objective: To investigate the extent to which presented interaction alerts, categorized as clinically relevant, require further medical action for the specific patient. Methods: We studied interaction alerts provided by Janusmed, presented at physician consultations for 274 consecutive primary care patients, 65 years of age and with 2 drugs in the medication list. The analysis was retrospective and based on printouts from the medical records for the 21/2 years preceding the consultation. Alerts classified as clinically significant (categories C and D according to the Janusmed classification system) were assessed by two specialist physicians, first independently and then in consensus, as to whether they justified any medical action not taken by the prescribing physician. Results: A total of 206 clinically relevant drug interaction alerts were triggered in 101 (37%) patients. Some action in response to the alert was deemed medically justified for 35 (17%) alerts in 26 (26%) of these patients. The most commonly suggested actions were switching to a less interacting drug in the same drug class (n ,"" 10), separating drug intake (n "","" 9), and ordering a laboratory test (n "","" 8).

Results: Of 276 166 738 weighted visits of older cancer patients who experienced pain, 10 007 639 (3.6%) weighted visits resulted in prescribing an opioid alone, and 21 934 106 (7.9%) weighted visits led to concomitant opioid and BZD prescriptions. Opioid users were slightly more likely to be female, from the Midwest, and have lung or breast cancer compared to non-users. Concomitant users were significantly more likely to be from the Midwest (p ,"" 0.02) and prescribed an opioid and BZD in the primary care setting (p < 0.001) compared to nonopioid users. Compared to 57% fall events in opioid-only users, there were 94% fall events in concomitant users. Concomitant users had alarmingly a 2.81 (OR: 2.81, 95% CI: 1.88-4.21) times higher odds of falling compared to non-users (83%). Falls in concomitant users peaked in 20092011 (42%) and then declined in 2015-2017 (6%) as expected. Conclusions: Older cancer patients inherently have an increased fall risk, and concomitant therapy of opioids and BZD further compounds this risk. Prevalence rates of concomitant prescribing declined between 2015-2017, showing that clinicians were adhering to Beers Criteria and CDC guidelines.

Of patients on opioids, 12% were on HIOP, and 88% were on LIOP. When evaluating adverse events, fall risk was 75% and 48% for HIOP and LIOP users, respectively. The odds of fall events in patients on HIOP was almost 3 times (AOR: 3.09, 95% CI: 1.01-9.47) higher compared to patients on LIOP. Of HIOP, methadone was the most significantly associated with falls (P < 0.001), whereas oxycodone was significantly associated with falls for LIOP (P , 0.03). Patients on acetaminophen and opioids concurrently were almost twice as likely to incur a fall event if they were on HIOP (P , 0.21). Patients on concurrent NSAIDs had two times lower odds of falling if they were on a HIOP (P ,"" 0.23). Conclusions: HIOP, when prescribed to older patients with cancer, are associated with nearly 3-fold fall events, but this needs further investigation. Concurrently prescribing acetaminophen or NSAID may also have a clinically important effect on fall risk, even though it is not statistically significant. Tight control with rigorous treatment guidelines in prescribing HIOP to this patient population may help in addressing the issue of fall events. Decision makers may need to be more vigilant when determining the type of opioids to prescribe and increase monitoring of fall-related adverse events in older cancer patients on HIOP and other pain medications.""",1.0,clinical,True

The median facility-level rate of PI use of antipsychotics ranged from 0% to 13.6% in Q1 (n "", 68 LTCFs) to 31.14% to 100% in Q5 (n , 68 LTCFs). There was significant variation between the highest (Q5) and lowest rates (Q1) of PI use of antipsychotics based on remoteness (p ,"" 0.03) and socioeconomic status (p < 0.01). LTCFs in major cities (Q1 74% vs Q5 88%) were more likely to use PI antipsychotic medications than those in regional and remote areas.

Results: In the total study population of 31 511 patients (mean age 75 years (SD 8), 46% men), 3735 (12%) patients were classified as frail by their GP. The CCI showed the highest AUC (0.79, 95% CI: 0.78- 0.79), followed by the CDS (0.69, 95% CI: 0.68-0.69). Moderate sensitivity to identify frailty was found when using the DPI or the CCI, while sensitivity was poor using the CDS and FI. Specificity was highest for the CCI (0.70, 95% CI: 0.69-0.70). Calibration was considered good for all instruments. Different results were observed when applied in subgroups of age and sex. Overall, the four instruments showed poorer performance in men and women aged >85 years compared to younger age groups (AUC 0.55 to 0.58 in men and 0.58 to 0.61 in women).

Results: We identified 1201 eligible patients admitted to a SNF after a hip fracture (mean age 81 [standard deviation 11] years]; 68% female; 85% White) with 1704 initial analgesic orders (45% opioids, 38% APAP, 6% NSAIDs, 11% combination products).

4099,"Background: Long-term exposure to drugs with anticholinergic and sedating properties is associated with worse cognitive and physical function in older adults, therefore, it is important to identify subgroups who may be at increased risk of prolonged exposure at high doses. Estimating longitudinal trajectories of use may be impacted by how missing data are addressed. Objectives: To assess whether estimates of longitudinal trajectories in use of these drugs (collectively assessed via the Drug Burden Index (DBI score)) and trajectory membership are affected by the missing data approach. Methods: We used a 0.2% nationwide, random sample of US Medicare beneficiaries, age 66+ years with fee-for-service coverage (A, B, D) during 2014-2016. Our cohort included initiators of DBI drugs, using a 1-year lookback to exclude prevalent users. After initiating, we estimated each patient's average daily score each month (12 scores per patient). We estimated 1-year DBI score trajectories using groupbased trajectory modeling (GBTM) and k-means clustering (KMC) methods, allowing for 2-5 groups/clusters. DBI score could be missing due to death, administrative censoring, or insurance disenrollment. To assess the impact of missing data, we compared a complete case",1.0,cluster,True
4100,"analysis approach (all 12 scores needed) versus each trajectory estimator's default approach (only 1+ score needed for GBTM, 2+ scores needed for KMC). Results: Among the 10 993 eligible patients, 6% died, 31% were administratively censored, and 3% disenrolled. In both longitudinal trajectory methods, the complete case analysis approach suggested that 3 trajectory patterns captured heterogeneity in DBI scores over time: a very small group (2%) with persistently high DBI scores (DBI>1); a small group (18%) with stable lower DBI scores (DBI0.5); and a large group (80%) with quickly decreasing lower DBI scores (DBI< 0.5). Results from the default approaches were qualitatively the same as the complete case analysis. Graphical displays will accompany these results. Conclusions: In this study, with high prevalence of missing data, longitudinal trajectories were similar across competing approaches for handling missing data. Future work will explore the impacts of missing data and the potential for selection bias when characterizing longitudinal patterns of other drug classes.",1.0,case,True

4110,"Background: Statins are one of the most widely used therapeutic classes in older adults. Nonetheless, there is very limited evidence-based data on the benefits and risks of statins for the population aged 75 years, especially in primary prevention. The population-based patterns of prescription and discontinuation of statins in oldest old are not well described. Objectives: The objective was to draw a portrait of statin prescription and discontinuation among community dwelling, oldest old adults in Quebec, Canada, between 2008 and 2018. Methods: Using the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System, we built a population-based cohort of all individuals 80 years on April 1, 2013. To be included, individuals had to live in the community and be covered with the provincial drug plan between April 1, 2008, and April 1, 2013. We studied their use of statins from April 1, 2008, to March 31, 2018, or until the end of their eligibility to the public drug plan (e.g., transfer to a long-term care facility, death). We identified statin claims from the pharmaceutical database to determine the date of statin initiation (if between 2008 and 2018) and discontinuation. We used descriptive statistics to portray the different patterns of statin use and discontinuation during the follow-up. Results: We included 278 996 individuals, with a mean age of 84.8 years and 63% women. Around half of them were current statin users on April 1, 2013 (n ,"" 137 068; 49%).

4114,"Background: Characterization of the dynamic changes in burden of comorbidities and healthcare utilizations before and after dementia diagnosis is crucial in addressing the care needs of people with dementia. Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the dynamic changes in comorbidity and healthcare utilization among incident dementia patients in Taiwan. Methods: People aged 65 years or older and newly diagnosed with dementia (ICD-9-CM codes 290, 294, 331.0-331.2, 331.82, 331.89, 331.9; ICD-10-CM codes: F01-F04, G30, G31) between 2004 and 2013 were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database. To describe the changes of comorbidity before and after dementia diagnosis, we selected 22 common diseases/conditions in dementia patients and used normalization method based on prevalence at baseline to capture the changes in these diseases/conditions 3 years before and 5 years after diagnosis of dementia. Number of outpatient visits, emergency room visits, admissions (including length of stay), and psychotropic mediation uses during the same observational period were also estimated. Results: Dementia patients were more likely to have comorbidity after the diagnosis of dementia compared to baseline. During the 5-years of follow-up, the prevalence of schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson disease, and anxiety, increased by 153.1%, 150.6%, 146.3%, and 94.9%, respectively. The prevalence of other comorbidities also increased by approximately 65% to 110% compared to baseline. In addition, patients were more likely to have delirium, fracture, insomnia, and ulcer both at baseline and first year after the diagnosis of dementia.

Methods: We used the Surveillance Epidemiology and End ResultsMedicare database to identify a cohort of adults aged 66 years and older diagnosed with incident locally advanced esophageal cancer between 2004 and 2017. Age-standardized rates of treatment receipt were calculated across the time period. Joinpoint regression was used to detect temporal trends in treatment receipt. Trend analyzes were performed to examine how the percentage of trimodal and definitive chemoradiation patients receiving cisplatin-based, carboplatin-based, and other chemotherapy regimens evolved over time. Results: In total, 4332 adults aged 66 years with locally advanced esophageal cancer were included.

4154,"Background Gabapentin has been increasingly prescribed to older adults; however, recent studies raise concerns about the safety related to misuse and adverse events (e.g., respiratory depression, dizziness, and sedation). Moreover, the relationship between gabapentin use and motor behavior changes in older adults has not been studied yet. Objectives We aimed to examine the association of gabapentin use and motor behavior changes in older adults with normal cognition. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set (2005-March 2021). We identified gabapentin new-users with normal cognition at the visit of gabapentin initiation (i.e., index visit) and no history of gait disorder, falls, and slowness. New-users were matched on year of first enrollment and time of gabapentin initiation since enrollment to randomly select nonusers (1 to 9 ratio) with replacement. The outcomes of interest, including gait disorder, falls, and slowness, were defined based on clinician judgment and assessed at the first and second visits after the index visit. We used stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights and stabilized inverse probability of censoring weights to mitigate confounding and selection bias. Confounders were measured at index visit (except for smoking history and diabetes which was only available at enrollment) and included demographics (age, sex, education, and race); body mass index; smoking history; comorbidities (depression, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and anxiety); and medications (opioids, antiseizures, and anxiolytic, sedative, and hypnotics).

4165,"Background: Multimorbidity, potentially inappropriate medications, and polypharmacy are common and have been reported to be associated with adverse outcome in elderly. In the past decade, the World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed the Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) screening tool to assess the intrinsic capacity (IC), defined as the composite of all physical and mental capacities that an individual can draw upon during his/her life. However, studies on the association between IC, PIM, and polypharmacy are limited. Objectives: This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the risk of IC decline associated with PIM and polypharmacy in older adults. Methods: Eligible study subjects were older adults aged 65 years old and older who attended a community hospital for senior citizens' health examination, completed the WHO ICOPE screening assessment, and finished the survey (for baseline characteristics collection) between March 1 to October 31, 2021. For all study subjects, we calculated their IC score. The IC score ranged from 0 to 6, with a higher score indicating better IC. PIM was defined as if older adults received medications listed in the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) 2019 Beers Criteria. Polypharmacy was defined as the concurrent use of five or more medications by older adults. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of IC decline associated with PIM and polypharmacy. Results: A total of the 404 older adults (mean age 72 [standard deviation (SD) 6.7] years old and 51% were female) were included in our study. Approximately 66.1% (n ,"" 267) of them were with an education level greater than senior high school. The number of medications received per day were 5.4 ± 6.2. Approximately half of them (52.7%) received PIM and one-third of them (35.9%) had polypharmacy. The most commonly prescribed PIM were benzodiazepines and Z-drug (31.9%). The IC score was 4.54 [SD1.1]. The logistic regression models revealed that PIM was associated with a 2.06-fold increased risk of IC decline (aOR 2.06 [95% CI 1.32-3.22]) and polypharmacy was associated with a 2.46 -fold increased risk of IC decline (aOR 2.46 [95% CI 1.57-3.85]).

4168,"Background: Fractures have serious health consequences in older adults, including hospitalizations, institutionalization, and death. Many medications are individually associated with the risk of falls and, consequently, fracture. It is less clear that the use of multiple concomitant medications such as polypharmacy (5 medications) increases the risk of fracture. Objectives: To identify what is known about the effect of polypharmacy on the risk of bone fracture in adults aged 65 years and to examine the methods used to study this effect. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of studies published through June 21, 2021, in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Cochrane, Web of science, and gray literature, regardless of language. The main concepts for the search were fractures, older adults, and polypharmacy. We screened titles, abstracts, and full texts and performed data extraction and quality assessment with two independent reviewers. We performed a narrative synthesis of the results since meta-analysis was not feasible. Results: A total of 20 articles published between 2008 and 2021 were included. Nine different definitions of polypharmacy were used and were based on three methods of medication count (8/20 simultaneous, 4/20 cumulative, 2/20 daily average, and 6/20 indeterminate). Polypharmacy was a relevant modifiable factor in the two predictive studies included. It was prevalent among older people with a fracture and a dose-response relationship was demonstrated between increasing numbers of medications and fractures. However, only five of these studies presented multivariate analyzes. Of the four articles that did not demonstrate neither a positive association between prevalent polypharmacy and fracture nor a dose-response relationship, only one included a multivariate analysis. The articles were rated from poor to acceptable quality. Conclusions: Polypharmacy is a modifiable risk factor of interest for fractures in older adults and could contribute to quickly and easily identify individuals at risk of fracture. The diversity of methods for calculating medications and definitions of polypharmacy highlights the importance of detailed methodology for understanding and comparing results. Adjustment for confounding variables, for example with multivariate analyzes, is recommended.",1.0,positive,True

Methods: We included patients with a documented diagnosis of dementia within the electronic medical record (eMR), aged 75 year and consecutively admitted to three hospitals in Sydney, Australia between July 2016 and February 2020. Frailty was measured using a 37-items Frailty Index (FI) developed specifically to measure frailty in acute care settings. Participants were classified as frail if they scored >0.25 and non-frail for scores  0.25. Medication use was defined using three parameters including exposure to polypharmacy (5  drugs); the use of at least one inappropriate medication according to the 2015 Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs); and exposure to medications with anticholinergic and sedative properties as defined by the Drug Burden Index (DBI). Inferential and descriptive analyzes were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), and statistical significance was determined as P value < 0.05. Results: On preliminary analyzes, 502 participants were included (56% males) with the mean age of 85.9, SD 5.7. Seventy eight percent (n , 390) were classified as frail and 22% (n ,"" 112) as non-frail.

Additionally, we restricted the analyzes to patients with 2 unique providers in the prior 360 days of cohort entry (i.e., DH-CCB or RAASi initiation) using national provider identifier (NPI). Results: Overall, 1987 patients comprised the DH-CCB - LD dyad, and 3148 patients comprised the RAASi - LD dyad, in which 1250 (63%) patients and 1813 (58%) patients had dyad medications prescribed by discordant providers, respectively.

Differences of medicines' consumption on gender and age groups for district of dispensing, INN and therapeutic group were assessed in a generalized linear model. Spearman correlation assessed the monotonic relationship between study variables. Results: A higher consumption of medicines was observed in women, more evident with aging, except in the oldest olds, where the gender difference tends to shrink. Use per capita shows an opposite trend, with the oldest-old men surpassing oldest-old women (mean packages 55.5 in men (M) vs. 55.1 in women (W)). Therapeutic class ranking is led by cardiovascular medicines (37% M vs. 31% W) followed by CNS medicines (30%) and antidiabetics (13%) in women, and antidiabetics (16%) and benign prostatic hypertrophy drugs (14%) in men. There were statistically significant differences regarding gender in the per capita use of antidepressants, anxiolytics, antithrombotic agents and opioids, the latter two also with significant differences in the younger and older age groups. Similarly, differences were found in all three age groups (65-74, 75-84, 85+) in 10 of the 18 districts of Portugal mainland.

Regular medications were categorized as symptomatic or preventive based on published lists and expert consensus. Results: Overall, 550 Australian residents (median age 89 years; IQR 84-92; 73% female) and 333 Japanese residents (median 87 years; IQR 83-91; 73% female) were included. In Australia, 42% and 46% of residents were frail or most-frail respectively. In Japan, 25% and 62% of residents were frail or most-frail respectively. Most-frail residents received the highest mean number of medications in Australia (10.1 ± 4.0) and Japan (6.9 ± 3.4). Preventive medications (56%) were more prevalent than symptomatic medications (44%) irrespective of frailty status or age in Australia but not in Japan. In Australia, mean symptomatic medications were more prevalent with increasing frailty (nonfrail: 3.7; frail: 4.2; most-frail: 4.8) but less prevalent with age (<80 years: 5.0; 80-89 years: 4.6; 90 years: 4.1). In Japan, a ratio of symptomatic to preventive medications of 1.3 was observed across all frailty status and age groups. Among most-frail residents in Australia, paracetamol (76%), vitamin D analogs (55%), and contact laxatives (45%) were the most prevalent medications used. In Japan, osmotic laxatives (55%), proton pump inhibitors (51%), and calcium channel blockers (34%) had the highest prevalence among most-frail residents. Irrespective of frailty status and age, the most frequently prescribed medications were paracetamol (69%) in Australia and osmotic laxatives (56%) in Japan. Conclusions: Residents who were most-frail used the highest number of medications in these two Australian and Japanese cohorts. Increasing frailty was associated with higher use of symptomatic medications in Australia but this did correspond to lower use of preventive medications.

The incident CV event was defined as patients without a history of CV events within 5 years prior to the event date. We calculated anticholinergic burden scores based on Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden scale (ACB). We compared the scores within the hazard period (defining as a 30-day period before the event date), with referent period (which was a random selection of a 30-day period between 60 and 180 days before the event). To address the issue of prescription trends of drugs, we selected a 1:1 matched control group without a record of CV event but had same disease risk score (DRS) with each case patient for the control-crossover analysis. We performed conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the difference of scores for anticholinergic burden (3+, 1-2, and 0 point) between hazard and referent periods. Results: We identified a total of 317 446 case patients. The average age of the cases was 78.4 (SD, 0.01) years. Compared to the score 0 point, we found the ORs were 9.35 (95% CI, 9.159.55) and 4.62 (4.52-4.71) for the score 3+ and 1-2, respectively in the casecrossover analysis; the ORs were 1.21 (1.19-1.24) and 1.18 (1.16- 1.21) for the score 3+ and 1-2, respectively in the control-crossover analysis. The case-time-control analysis suggested higher scores of anticholinergic burdens were associated with the risk of CV events (OR, 7.72; 95% CI, 7.507.94) for score 3+ and (3.91; 3.79-4.03) for score 1-2.

4209,"(2018-2021) were used for the analysis. Nurses' notes describing fall events were identified though a keyword search for ""fall"" or ""fell"". Natural language processing (NLP) techniques were used to extract prominent latent constructs derived from the co-occurrence of words. Weighted unigram/bigram frequencies were calculated for each note (after removing ""the"", ""a"", etc.), then inversely weighted by the total number of notes in which they occur (TF-IDF method). This process calculates the informativeness of a word for a specific note. Latent constructs were identified through an iterative optimization process known as non-negative matrix factorization. This method assigns scores to both words and notes. Notes scoring high on one construct are likely to contain words also scoring high on that construct and vice versa. Two reviewers independently examined high-scoring words and read the corresponding full nurses' notes. After discussing their interpretations, they were able to achieve consensus on the construct labels. Results: A total of 9104 unique fall events were identified. The first 10 constructs corresponded to three stages of fall response events: 1) fall context (i.e., wheelchair, bed); 2) post-fall checks (i.e., injury, neurological, well-being); and 3) post-fall actions (i.e., assisted transfers, escalation to supervisors, root-cause analysis). Medications were notably absent from the top 10 constructs identified. Conclusions: Nurses' notes provide valuable contextual information about fall events, which may be useful in developing novel fall prevention strategies in nursing homes. Future research includes extending the use of NLP to further isolate and categorize fall response stages.

There is limited evidence on the impact of health insurance on the health and economic well-being of Indian beneficiaries along with uncertainty in the execution of such economic evaluations in India, due to some hesitancy for the adoption of developed countries guidelines. Hence it is crucial to evaluate the reporting of methods and results of cost-effectiveness analyzes and establish their validity. We describe and examine reporting characteristics of methods and results of cost-effectiveness analyzes conducted in India. Objectives: 1) To identify cost-effectiveness studies conducted in India and report their characteristics. 2) To assess the quality of the studies conducted in India using cost-effectiveness analysis. Methods: A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar from the inception to 30 November 2021 to identify cost-effectiveness studies conducted in India. A combination of keywords, MeSH terms on costeffectiveness, and India were used with Boolean operators. The study included all the cost-effectiveness analyzes conducted that have used quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as the outcome measures. Two reviewers independently extracted data using a selfdeveloped item data collection form designed to assess reporting details of the studies. Quality of studies was evaluated using the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) and Quality of health economic studies (QHES) checklists. The collected data were analyzed descriptively.

Most articles showed moderate quality when assessed with the CHEC (68.75%) and QHES (45.83%) checklists. In CHEC, most studies have not mentioned the costs of physical units (39, 81.3%) and are not valued appropriately (27, 56.3%). In contrast, in QHES many studies did not mention about study objective (26, 54.2%), data abstraction (32, 66.7%) leads to a decline in quality of studies.

4266,"Background: The need for real-world evidence (RWE) is ever increasing; however, there are limitations to means of RWE generation. Large healthcare databases are quick and inexpensive but lack comprehensive data on clinical characteristics and patient outcomes. Bespoke data collection address these limitations, but at a cost that constrains scale and generalizability. A need thus exists for a single source solution to solve this issue. Objectives: To describe development of a consolidated data model to support RWE generation. Methods: In the United States, integrated delivery networks (IDNs) own healthcare facilities and employ healthcare providers. Electronic medical records (EMR) capture information from encounters at their facilities, with curated data including diagnoses, prescription orders, and lab results; chart review can be used to extract information from unstructured/uncurated data fields (e.g., signs, symptoms, diagnostic findings). IDNs may also capture claims for care within/outside their facilities, including prescription dispenses, procedures, and charged/ paid amounts. Some allow direct-to-patient contact, which offers the ability to collect data on preferences, indirect cost, and health-related quality of life. Results: Our consolidated data model can support various RWE use cases, including but not limited to: (1) external control arms; (2) caseselection algorithm development; (3) pragmatic trials; (4) prospective observational studies (including but not limited to registries); (5) clinical decision support tools and medical device utility development/",1.0,clinical,True

Administrative data allow estimation of historical populationbased incidence rates in large studies that are useful for assessment of potential safety signals. However, limited information is available regarding changes in incidence rates resulting from alterations in healthcare seeking behavior and COVID-19 infection disease itself. Objectives: To estimate background incidence of AESI in the preCOVID and active-COVID eras (prior to the distribution of SARSCoV-2 vaccines). Methods: This observational cohort study included 50 million individuals sampled from HealthVerity closed claims to mirror the 2019 US census age and sex distribution. A 1-year of insurance enrollment was required prior to cohort entry in at least one of two time periods: preCOVID (01Dec2018-30Nov2019) and COVID era (01Dec2019- 10Dec2020). The incidence rates of 37 AESI per 100 000 personyears and associated 95% CI were calculated among individuals with no diagnosis of the applicable condition during a clean period prior to cohort entry. Within each time period, estimates were stratified by age and sex. Results: Among individuals sampled from HealthVerity, there were 26.9 million individuals included in the pre-COVID and 25.9 million individuals included in the COVID era cohorts. Median age was 47 years, and 52% of individuals were male. Estimated IR varied substantially across categories of age and gender. For approximately half (46%) of the AESI considered, COVID era incidence was reduced by at least 15% compared to the pre-COVID era. The incidence of anosmia was elevated in the COVID era vs. the pre-COVID era (149.84 vs 47.67). The incidence of other COVID-19 disease outcomes was not elevated: myocarditis (9.51 vs 9.97), pericarditis (19.24 vs 24.53), single organ cutaneous vasculitis (16.91 vs 21.93), and Chilblain-like lesions (3.95 vs 4.29). Conclusions: Potentially consistent with decreases in healthcare utilization and other COVID-19 pandemic factors, evidence of depression in claimsbased estimates of the incidence of nearly half of the AESI were identified in the COVID era.

For surrogacy, an additional step would be to evaluate the relationship between treatment effects on early and late outcomes. Counterfactual-based mediation analysis is described, to quantify (i) the difference in late outcomes between treatment groups had treatment not affected the early outcome and (ii) the change in late outcome associated with a change in the early outcome with treatment. Results: A framework will be developed considering descriptive analyzes, association assessment and causal relationships and their interlink for the statistical evaluation of surrogacy. Conclusions: Using appropriate descriptive and association analyzes provides insight into the expected causal relationship between the early and late outcome. Evaluation of the causal relationship requires assumptions to be made that may only be approximations of the truth. Even when full surrogacy may not be proven, our framework will provide insight into the extent to which a change in the early outcome supports a change in the late outcome.

Outcomes of interest were treatment effects in terms of generic and disease-specific patient-reported outcomes, patientspecific disease burden and utility values. Relevant studies meeting selection criteria were identified through systematic searches of Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica dataBASE (Embase), American Economic Association EconLit, and Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) Reviews. Hand searches of five relevant conferences from the past two years and health technology assessment (HTA) body websites were carried out to supplement the evidence base. The process of study screening, study selection, and data extraction was conducted by two independent reviewers and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes guidelines. The Minimum Standard Checklist for HRQoL outcomes was used to assess the quality of HRQoL studies. Studies were limited",1.0,disease,True

Searches of pre-specified conference proceedings and HTA body websites resulted in the identification of 17 additional citations. After study selection, 65 studies were included in the reivew. Together, these studies show that CC has a high humanistic burden as measured by a variety of instruments including the cough visual analog scale, Leicester Cough Questionnaire, Cough-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, Chronic Cough Impact Questionnaire, Short Form-36, and EuroQol-5 Dimensions. Some studies show that pharmacological treatments such as gefapixant, gabapentin, pregabalin, and morphine sulfate can impact the HRQoL of patients with CC. We did not find any study looking at HSUV related to CC. Conclusions: The available evidence suggests that CC lowers patients' HRQoL. Pharmacological treatments such as gefapixant, gabapentin, pregabalin, and morphine sulfate, can impact the HRQoL of CC patients. However, the existing evidence base is small, and none of these drugs are currently approved for the treatment of CC. Therefore, there is a considerable need for approved therapies that can improve the HRQoL of CC patients.",0.0,,False

4315,"Background: HIV infection remains a public health concern, with approximately thirty-eight thousand people in treatment in Portugal. This results into increasingly high consumption levels of medicines for HIV, associated with high costs for the Portuguese healthcare service. Hospital management boards have tools that help control expenditure, and manage tight budgets; one of them is the use of generics. When branded medicines lose market exclusivity, generics typically enter the market at lower prices, decreasing the cost of treatment for patients. Objectives: To determine the impact of generic entry on the HIV patient treatment cost between the period of 2011 to September 2021. Additional outcomes aimed at the characterization of the consumption and expenditure evolution of HIV pharmacological classes across a time period of nine years (2011-2020). Methods: A quasi-experimental interrupted time-series analysis was conducted to examine the HIV treatment cost and expenditure, as well as the unit cost per HIV medicine, from data of 26 hospitals of the Portuguese healthcare service during January 2011 to September 2021. Data regarding medicine consumption and expenditure were acquired from INFARMED's database, while the number of patients was provided quarterly by the Information System for Contracting and Monitoring (SICA). Seven HIV generic medicines were analyzed (Emtricitabine + tenofovir; Ritonavir; Lopinavir + Ritonavir; Darunavir; Lamivudine + Abacavir; Efavirenz and Tenofovir). All generics entered the hospital setting from 2012 and 2020 and were selected according to the hospital's consumption level.

An evidenceinformed Community Pharmacy-Based Diabetes Care Plan was developed to provide patient-led goal-setting support and motivational interviewing to people living with type 2 diabetes. Community pharmacists identified what patients perceived as'problems' with managing their diabetes and supported them in achieving their self-set goals. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of the care plan on self-reported outcomes using validated questionnaires: patient activation measure (PAM©), quality of life (EQ-5D-5L© and EQ-VAS), medication adherence (Morisky, Green, and Levine Adherence Scale (MGL)); and on clinical outcomes: plasma glucose, waist circumference and body mass index (BMI). Methods: A longitudinal study design was employed. Ethical approval was obtained before commencing the study. Patients living with type 2 diabetes attended six remote pharmacist consultations over six months in 20 community pharmacies in Lagos, Nigeria. Self-reported outcome measures were collected at baseline and on study completion. Clinical outcomes were collected monthly, including patients' plasma glucose, weight, waist circumference and height.

4326,"Background: Regulators have issued safety warnings for an association between thiazide use and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)following observational studies that found an association between thiazide use and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). We hypothesized that diagnostic suspicion bias could impact the significance or magnitude of this association. Objectives: To estimate the impact of diagnostic suspicion bias in studies of thiazide and NMSC. Methods: A cohort study of users of thiazides (exposed), angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (controls), using administrative data from British Columbia (2000-2019). Users entered the cohort at the first-ever diagnosis of NMSC by a family practitioner (suspected NMSC) and were followed until NMSC diagnosis confirmation based on a validated combination of diagnoses and procedures. Exposed and control groups were frequency-matched (1:3) on year, age, sex, geographic area, income, and use of other photosensitizing medications. We estimated the hazard ratios using Cox regression, adjusting for the matching factors, comorbidities, and prior use of other medications and health services. A hazard ratio of less than 1 (exposed compared with controls) of a confirmed NMSC diagnosis supported an increased probability of a false-positive diagnosis among thiazide users with suspected NMSC, i.e., the presence of diagnostic suspicion bias. Results: In the frequency-matched cohort, 578 of 3138 exposed individuals (18.4%) and 2010 of the 9477 controls (21.2%) had a confirmed NMSC diagnosis during 1 year of follow-up. The estimated crude and adjusted hazard ratios for the frequency-matched cohort were 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.86, 1.07) and 0.96 (0.85, 1.09). In an analysis stratified by year of cohort entry (before 2017 when the large observational studies on the thiazide-NMSC association were published, or 2017 and later) the hazard ratio moved away from the null after 2017.

Despite multiple efforts to improve screening and linkage to care, persistent gaps in the HCV care cascade have been identified in the published literature. Objectives: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis integrating published data to characterize and summarize estimates of the HCV cascade of care in emergency departments (ED) and ambulatory care settings [i.e., HCV antibody (Ab) screening, HCV RNA testing, contact and referral to a specialty provider, treatment initiation and completion, and sustained virologic response (SVR)]. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and PsycINFO for articles examining the cascade of HCV care (e.g., in ED or ambulatory care settings) published between January 2014 and March 2021. We excluded non-English articles, systematic reviews, case studies, or studies conducted in non-developed countries. We performed generalized linear mixed models for meta-analyzes of seven steps of HCV care cascade to estimate pooled prevalence estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Hartung-Knapp adjustment and logit transformation. Results: Among 100 078 articles screened, we identified 41 articles focusing on ED (n , 11) and ambulatory care settings (n ,"" 31). Of 84 637 individuals visiting the ED, 38.2% (95% CI 12.7% - 72.4%) were screened for HCV infection. Of those with a positive Ab test, 51.4% had a positive HCV RNA test, 32.6% had a successful contact rate, 16.6% were linked to care, 14.1% initiated treatment and 4.7% achieved SVR. The screening rate for HCV infection was 71.4% (95% CI 27.4% - 94.3%) among 618 443 individuals visiting an ambulatory care setting. Of those with a positive Ab test, 54.9% had a positive HCV RNA test, 47.1% had a successful contact rate, 37.7% were linked to care, 19.8% were prescribed treatment, 15.1% completed treatment and 13.1% achieved SVR. Conclusions: Compared to ambulatory care settings, screening for HCV infection, successful contact, and linkage to care rates were decreased by up to 50% that subsequently resulted in a lower SVR rate in ED settings.

Methods: Historical cohort study of UK patients 4 years old using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (2008-2019). Patients receiving intermittent OCS were categorized by OCS prescribing pattern based on prescription gaps (only 1 [once-only], >1 with any gaps >90-days but no gaps < 90-days [less frequent] and >1 with < 90-day gap(s) [frequent]) and indexed on the first intermittent OCS prescription within 3 months of an asthma-related event; OCS-naïve patients with asthma matched on gender, age and index date served as controls. Follow-up was until end-of-records. Patients with a diagnosis for a chronic condition treated with OCS or a chronic adverse event outcome pre-index were excluded. HCRU (general practitioner [GP], Accident and Emergency [A&E] and outpatient visits, hospitalizations and prescriptions) and cost were compared for OCS and non-OCS use (Mann-Whitney test) and for intermittent OCS use patterns (Chi-squared test). Cost sources were Personal Social Services Research Unit 2020 for GP and outpatient visits and hospitalizations; NHS National Cost Collection 2019/20 for A&E visits; Prescription Cost Analysis 2018 for prescriptions. Results: Of 763 136 patients with asthma receiving an OCS prescription, 149 191 met eligibility criteria (52.6% female, mean age 38.7 years). 50.3%, 27.4% and 22.3% had once-only, less frequent and frequent pattern of OCS use during follow-up, respectively; 149 191 OCS-naïve patients were included. Frequency of respiratory-related GP, A&E and outpatient visits, hospitalizations and prescriptions post-index were higher in OCS versus OCS-naïve patients (Mean 9.0 vs 3.8, 1.8 vs 1.4, 5.2 vs 4.1, 2.0 vs 1.6 and 37.1 vs 13.9; all p < 0.0001), and increased with more frequent patterns of intermittent OCS use (p < 0.0001).

Methods: This retrospective observational cohort study used health administrative data to identify pts with primary advanced EC (American Joint Committee on Cancer de novo stage IIIB) or recurrent EC (progression from de novo stage I, II, and IIIA) between 2010 and 2018, with follow-up to December 2019. Treatment patterns included chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy agents. KaplanMeier methods were used to examine time to next treatment (TTNT; treatment initiation to initiation of subsequent treatment or any-cause death) and overall survival (OS; treatment initiation until any-cause death) from initiation of second-line (2L) chemotherapy following prior PBCT. Outcomes were stratified by disease status (A/R) and treatment type. Results: 1053 A/R EC pts were identified; 75.2% (N , 466/620) of advanced and 57.0% (N ,"" 247/433) of recurrent EC pts received first-line (1L) systemic therapy. In 1L, 96.1% of advanced and 45.3% of recurrent pts received PBCT. The study cohort included 187 advanced (N "", 144) and recurrent (N ,"" 43) EC pts who received 1L PBCT and initiated a 2L chemotherapy. Median TTNT for 2L chemotherapy was 6.4 months (95% CI: 5.3 to 7.7 months), and differed significantly by therapy, from 3.9 months (95% CI: 3.2 to 7.4 months) for liposomal doxorubicin (LD) to 9.9 months (95% CI: 7.1 to NA months) for carboplatin and LD. Median OS from initiation of 2L chemotherapy was 10.4 months (95% CI: 8.9 to 13.3 months) and significantly higher for those re-challenged with PBCT compared to no rechallenge (13.3 months [95% CI: 11.2 to 20.9 months] vs 6.4 months [95% CI: 4.6 to 10.4 months]; P < 0.001). Median OS also differed significantly by chemotherapy (P "","" 0.02), from 6.7 months (95% CI: 4.5 to 11.4 months) for LD to 13.3 months (95% CI: 9.1 to 41.2 months) for carboplatin and paclitaxel. TTNT and OS did not differ statistically by disease status (P "", 0.5 and P ,"" 0.06, respectively). Conclusions: Outcomes for A/R EC patients who progressed on/after PBCT in Canada represent a pressing unmet medical need that could benefit from novel therapies. Funding: GSK (216962).

4363,"Background: The COVID-19 Pandemic had created challenges for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), such as the difficulties accessing the health care system, transition to unplanned virtual care, reduction in physical activity, patients' concerns about medication risk and compliance, lack of social supports, and interaction with loved ones. This impact on patients with RA is complex and yet to be explored. Objectives: We examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with RA by comparing patient reported outcomes (PROs) and disease activity (DA), and medication profile between pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. Methods: The Ontario Best Practices Research Initiative is an observational clinical cohort of adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. For this analysis, patients were included if they had at least one visit with a physician or interviewer within 12 months before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 15 2020). Baseline characteristics, DA, as well as other PROs (HAQ-DI, RADAI, EQ5D, and medication use / changes) were included. Paired two-sample ttest and McNamar's test was performed for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Results: We identified 1508 patients (mean age ,"" 62.7, 79.3% female) that fulfilled eligibility criteria. With the pandemic, the number of physician visits per patient increased by a mean of 0.21 visits (SD: 1.51) (p < 0.0001). Despite the patient global and physician global assessment and composite DA scores being similar before and after the pandemic, swollen joint count (SJC) and tender joint counts (TJC) showed improvement during the pandemic (differences of - 0.49 (3.04), p < 0.0001 and À0.40 (3.73), p < 0.003 respectively). Similar improvement was observed in PROs, such as RADAI (À0.17 (1.40), p "","" 0.002) and fatigue (À0.48 (2.42), p < 0.0001). There were also statistically significant changes in the treatment algorithms as biologic (32.6% vs 29.9%' p "","" 0.002) and conventional synthetic DMARDs (83.3% vs 79.5%; p < 0.0001) usage were decreased with increased uptake in JAK inhibitors (12.1% vs 15.4%; p < 0.0001) with the pandemic. Conclusions: This study demonstrates disease activity in patients with RA changed during the pandemic. Despite stable composite indices, the PROs improving with the pandemic may be explained by the change in patients' lifestyles, such as being able to work from home. We also observed an increase in number of visits, which may be a limitation of the virtual care. Changes in medications may be attributed to either patients or physicians preferring treatment modalities with a shorter half-life given the concern of immunosuppression during the pandemic or the easiness of oral therapy compared to an SC therapy that requires patients' training.""",1.0,COVID-19,True

4366,"Background: Home time, the number of days alive and spent out of hospital and skilled nursing facility, has been proposed as a patient-centered outcome. The role of frailty in the association of oral anticoagulants (OACs) with home time and medical cost for older adults with atrial fibrillation (AF) remains unclear. Objectives: To determine the comparative home time loss and cost of OACs in patients with AF, stratified by levels of frailty Methods: We used the US Medicare claims data to establish 4 new user cohorts: patients aged  65 years with a dispensing of warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, respectively, without any OAC use in the preceding 183 days from 2013 to 2017 (cohort entry date [CED],"" first dispensing date). The study cohorts were required to have a non-valvular AF diagnosis in the 365 days before CED (i.e., the covariate assessment period). Frailty was measured using a validated claims-based frailty index (range: 0-1; non-frail if < 0.15, pre-frail if 0.15-0.24, and frail if 0.25). We used inverse probability treatment weighting to balance 93 covariates among apixaban (referent group), warfarin, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban. We estimated odds ratio (OR) for having home-time-loss more than 14 days over 183 days following the CED using logistic regression and difference in permember per-year (PMPY) total cost of care using a generalized linear model. Results: Our study cohort included 143 191 apixaban (mean age 77.4 years [Y]), 149 706 warfarin (mean age 77.9 Y), 30 023 dabigatran (mean age 76.2 Y), and 113 842 rivaroxaban (mean age 76.4 Y) users. For the non-frail group, compared to apixaban users, the adjusted ORs of having home-time-loss > 14 days were 1.6 (95% confidence interval: 1.2, 2.1), 1.2 (0.9, 1.7), and 1.4 (1.0, 1.9) for warfarin, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban, respectively. The corresponding ORs were 1.2 (1.1, 1.4), 1.1 (0.9, 1.3), and 1.2 (0.98, 1.4) for the frail group. For the non-frail group, compared to apixaban users, the adjusted difference in PMPY ($) was 635.8 (À5.4, 1279.7), À459.4 (À1068.1, 147.4), and 793.2 (146.7, 1443.0) for warfarin, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban, respectively. The corresponding estimates were 1675.6 (À889.4, 4255.2), À176.7 (À2664.6, 2310.7), and 3863.4 (1200.0, 6560.8) for the frail group. Conclusions: Apixaban was associated with lower home time loss compared to warfarin and rivaroxaban in the non-frail group but this benefit was only observed when compared to rivaroxaban in the frail group. Apixaban was associated with greater total healthcare cost compared to rivaroxaban, and the cost increase was considerably higher in patients with frailty.""",1.0,trial,True

4372,"Background: Two oral antiviral therapies have recently received FDA emergency authorization for COVID-19 patients at high risk of disease progression. Limited real-world data are available on the medical conditions associated with hospitalization. Objectives: To assess the rate of hospitalization and explore the baseline medical conditions associated with the risk of COVID-19 progression. Methods: Patients presenting with a diagnosis of COVID-19 in the outpatient setting (index) were identified using the Optum® deidentified Clinformatics® Data Mart database between 04/01/2020 and 05/31/2021. All diagnoses prior to index were extracted from a 12-month baseline period with continuous enrollment and no evidence of pregnancy or prior COVID-19 infection. Patients were followed until inpatient hospitalization or 30 days following index. Those who died or disenrolled prior to day 30 were censored. Any baseline comorbidity with at least a 5% sample prevalence was included as a covariate in a regularized (LASSO) cox regression model predicting progression to hospitalization, controlling for demographics and yearquarter of diagnosis. Results: Of 487 060 patients identified, 16 392 were hospitalized within 30 days (3.39 hospitalizations per 100 patient months) and 3.05% were censored. 76.51% of hospitalizations occurred 10 days of index, with pneumonia or other diseases of the respiratory system present in 20.14%. Diseases of the circulatory system were the most common (18.84%) diagnosis for hospitalizations >20 days after index. A regularized cox regression identified 29 highly correlated baseline diagnoses including known risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, COPD, cardiovascular disease, liver disease and obesity. Sleep apnea (HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.14-1.26), fluid/electrolyte disorders (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.08-1.21) and history of mental health or substance abuse (HR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.05-1.15) were also highly predictive.

Patients socio-demographics, the type of immunosuppressive medication regimen, side effects and adherence data were collected using a predesigned data collection tool. Assessment of health related quality of life was done using Kidney transplant questionnaire-25 (KTQ-25). Descriptive and inferential analysis was carried out using STATA version 13. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine independent predictors of low HRQoL scores Results: The mean (SD) age of the participants was 45.4(14.7) with a male predominance (70%). Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity among study participants (60%) followed by both diabetes and hypertension (25%). The most prevalent immunosuppressant regimen was prednisolone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate (75%) and the adherence rate was 78.8%.

While some countries with joint replacement registries have recorded reductions in revision burden, other countries without joint replacement registries have also reported similar reductions. Objectives: This study aims to evaluate whether joint replacement registries are associated with the burden of revision changes while controlling for confounders that could affect the association. Methods: The assessment was performed by a difference-indifferences statistical approach using a panel regression model. The revision burden in the registry periods of registry countries was compared to the non-registry periods of the registry and non-registry countries. The effect of confounders was controlled by the linear trend in the model. Data were collected from 1980 to 2018. Registry data were obtained from joint replacement registries' annual reports, while non-registry data were obtained from each included country's pooled hospitals annual revision burden reported in the literature. Results: Data were obtained from 12 registry periods and 8 nonregistry periods. The average difference in revision burden in the registry periods of registry countries relative to the non-registry periods of registry and non-registry countries was statistically significant for hip 0.038 (3.80%; 95% CI: 0.025-0.051; p-value < 0.001), and knee 0.016 (1.63%; 95% CI: 0.010-0.023; p-value < 0.001). The establishment of joint replacement registries was associated with a 3.80 and 1.63 percentage points reduction in the revision burden for hip and knee, respectively for the whole sampling period. Conclusions: Joint replacement registries are associated with a significant reduction in the burden of revision.

Objectives: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (US) on screening for, diagnosing and surgically treating breast cancer (BC). Methods: Data was used from a random sample of 5.4 million US women drawn from the Komodo Healthcare Map, a large and nationally representative database of health insurance claims. BC screening by mammography, breast biopsy procedures, new BC diagnoses (i.e., BC diagnosis after 12 months without a claim for BC), and mastectomies were identified in the claims between 2016 to June 2021 (end of available data) by using CPT and ICD-10 codes. Monthly rates of mammograms, biopsies, diagnoses and mastectomies during the pandemic (from January 2020) were calculated per 100 000 female patients and compared to rates in the same month during the prepandemic period (mean monthly rates across 2016-2019). Results: The number of women undergoing mammography and breast biopsy started to decrease from January 2020. The reductions were largest in April 2020, with an 88% decrease in mammograms and a 44% decrease in biopsies compared to April in the pre-pandemic period. Rates gradually went back up in May and June 2020 but never exceeded pre-pandemic rates. There were also fewer BC diagnoses in the first period of 2020, with the greatest reduction again seen in April (À26% compared to April 2016-19). In line with these results, the number of mastectomies was also lower in the first part of 2020, though the greatest reduction occurred in June 2020 (À24% compared to June 2016-19), lagging two months behind the maximum reduction in breast cancer diagnoses. In line with the apparent absence in catch ups of breast cancer diagnoses, the reduction in mastectomies in the first period of 2020 was not made up in the subsequent period until June 2021. Conclusions: A substantial reduction in breast cancer diagnoses during the pandemic is apparent.

We estimated crude incidence rates of RSV-LRTIs ignoring palivizumab exposure (crude), and adjusted for periods of palivizumab exposure when the risk for infection was reduced(within 30 days of palivizumab administration). The adjustment divided the number of RSV LRTIs by efficacy estimates (preterm 78%, CLD 39%, CHD 45% for inpatient RSV-LRTI) or the average efficacy (50%) when condition- or outpatient settingspecific data were unavailable. Results: Among infants 12 months old within prematurity strata (29; 29-31; 32-34; 35-36; 37 weeks GA), crude RSV-LRTI incidence rates decreased from 73-72-57-35-15 for inpatient and 243-352- 286-247-168 for outpatient encounters per 10 000 children-month, respectively. Crude diagnosis-stratified incidence rates for inpatient (outpatient) encounters were 84 (332) for CLD, 101 (306) for CHD, 49 (163) for IM, 55 (264) for MD, 82 (267) for CF, and 157 (377) for Down. Immunoprophylaxis use is suggested for children with active CLD and IM in their second year of life; their incidence rates for CLD and IM were 108 (340) and 76 (149), respectively. Adjustment for palivizumab exposure increased incidence rates by 100-123% for inpatient RSV-LRTI and 100-119% for outpatient RSV-LRTI.

4457,"Background: Ureteroscopy (URS) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) are minimally-invasive procedures used in the treatment of urinary system stone disease (USSD). Additional procedures after URS or PCNL may be required due to early contra- or ipsilateral stone recurrence, regrowth of residual fragments, or planned staged procedures, all of which impose a burden on the patient and healthcare system. Objectives: To describe incremental healthcare costs associated with retreatment among adults undergoing URS or PCNL for USSD. Methods: The IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Database was used to identify adults aged 1864 years with USSD treated with URS or PCNL between 2010--2019. Patients had 12 months of continuous insurance coverage before (baseline) and after (follow-up) the first (index) procedure. The primary outcome was total (all-cause) healthcare costs measured over the follow-up period, not inclusive of index.

Results: ver the 12-month follow-up period, approximately 23% (27 402/119 800) of URS patients were retreated (82% had early retreatments) and 36% (1957/5516) of PCNL patients were retreated (78% had early retreatments). Among patients with retreatment during follow-up, modalities of retreatment were as follows: URS - 2.6% retreated with PCNL, 62.8% with URS, 36.8% with SWL; PCNL - 37.1% retreated with PCNL, 38.8% with URS, 28.5% with SWL. Retreatment was associated with statistically significant incremental healthcare cost increases (all P < 0.001): URS had a $14 998 (95% CI: $14 507-$15 488) increase with early retreatment and a $22 391 (95% CI: $21 445-$23 336) increase with later retreatment; PCNL had a $23 570 (95% CI: $21 411-$25 728) increase with early retreatment and a $21 893 (95% CI: $18 770-$25 015) increase with later retreatment. Conclusions: Retreatment during the first year following URS or PCNL is common, with associated economic burden of up to $23 500 per patient. The high rate of early retreatment and associated costs demonstrate that there is an unmet need to improve mid- to long-term results in URS and PCNL.",0.0,,False

However, the cost variation between these drugs makes the choice of treatment debatable. Objectives: To evaluate the patient-level real-world costeffectiveness of ACTH versus oral prednisolone for children with WS. Methods: A cost-effectiveness decision tree model was applied from the payer's perspective to predict the benefit and costs of ACTH and oral prednisolone in children with WS. Model inputs were obtained from real-world parent-reported data at a tertiary care center in North India. The model consisted of two health states either persistent cessation of spasms (within 14 days of treatment onset without any recurrence for  28 consecutive days) or no sustained cessation of spasms (within the 14 days of the treatment onset). The direct cost of treatment was collected as diagnostic, medications, hospital admissions, traveling, and lodging/ staying cost. Incremental costeffectiveness ratios (ICERs) for cost per child with spasm cessation were the primary outcome. One-way sensitivity analyzes were performed to understand the impact of different variables on the costeffectiveness model and visualized in the Tornado diagram. Probabilistic sensitivity analyzes using Monte Carlo simulation with over 10000 iterations were applied through the uncertainty range for ICER.

The study PLATO showed that ACS patients who were randomized to receive 12 months of ticagrelor had a significant reduction in the combined CVD endpoint. Objectives: The study objective was to evaluate the costeffectiveness of ticagrelor in reducing CV endpoint in the Indonesia setting. Methods: It used the Markov model as a decision analysis to compare ticagrelor with clopidogrel for ACS. The model constructed with a decision tree included four health conditions (no additional events, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and any cause death), The probability of each state and quality-adjusted life years were derived from the PLATO trial and Indonesia life table. The resource consumption and associated costs were collected from three hospitals (public, national referral, and private hospitals) in Indonesia. The study was conducted from a health care provider perspective, using 5 years and lifetime horizon and discounting rate of 3%. Results: The incremental QALYs and life-year gained (LYG) of ticagrelor in five years was 0.0410 and 0.0462, respectively; in a lifetime was 0.0828, and 0.0947, respectively. The ICER per QALY of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in private, national referral, and public hospitals was USD 2390.276, USD 3813.638, USD 1278.361, respectively for five years; and USD 2471.392, USD 5453.987, USD 2343.269, respectively for a lifetime.

Conclusions: QALYs and life-year gained of use ticagrelor higher compared to clopidogrel. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in five years and lifetime models showed under onetime GDP, which means the use of ticagrelor was highly cost-effective and acceptable to apply in the clinical setting in Indonesia.",1.0,disease,True

Methods: We reviewed selected peer-reviewed literature and regulatory documents to focus on 4 key features of RWE studies conducted in insurance billing/claims data and electronic health records to provide clinical evidence of risks or benefits: (1) Representative patient population; (2) Verified exposure/adherence to study drug; (3) Accounting for all study participants; (4) Outcomes accurately captured in diagnostic or billing codes. Results: Representative patient populations are a challenge in the fragmented US healthcare system because major RWD sources are segmented by age (excluding most patients > 65 years in commercial claims), gender (Veterans Administration health system), or socioeconomic status (Medicaid, private insurance). Exposure/ adherence is uncertain because RWE studies may assume that prescribed medicines were taken continuously by patients. One verification study reported that only a fraction of new prescriptions were then filled by the patients, ranging from 45% for pain medications to 76% for antimicrobials. Accounting for participants may not detect patient deaths because most insurance RWE sources cannot distinguish whether censored patients died or left the system in good health unless the patients died in-hospital or were separately linked to a death index. Many safety and efficacy outcomes cannot be captured by diagnostic/billing codes characterizing an office or emergency department visit or hospitalization. A 2020 FDA study of a widely used asthma drug with a boxed warning about neuropsychiatric side effects found no increased risk of depression in an asthma population more than 1 million patients. The study failed to capture an adverse effect of the asthma drug well documented elsewhere because the available diagnosis codes were inadequate. Conclusions: While RWE studies contribute valuable perspectives on many issues in drug therapy, using RWE to support regulatory decisions that can affect the health and safety of thousands require special vigilance, appropriate design, and understanding that some outcomes cannot be reliably evaluated in these data. Valid use of RWE could be expanded through upgrading the major data sources to support this important public health objective.",1.0,clinical,True

Objectives: Our study evaluates the payer costs of patients with COVID-19 compared to those of patients with influenza and viral pneumonia. Methods: Patients with COVID-19 from October first, 2020, to February first, 2021, or with influenza/ pneumonia (IP) from October first, 2018 to February first, 2019 were identified in IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE) and Medicare Supplemental databases. The date of first COVID-19 or influenza/ pneumonia (IP) diagnosis was defined as ""index""; all patients had  6 months of continuous enrollment pre- and post-index. COVID-19 patients were categorized by disease severity (mild, moderate, and severe) using the signs and symptoms definitions from the Janssen Phase 3 Trial. Asymptomatic COVID-19 cases were excluded. Variables for all patients included demographics and comorbidities at index. Duration of disease was estimated for all patients based on the date of first and last associated diagnosis or prescription. A maximum 35-day visit gap was allowed. Outcomes were all-cause payments (ACP) and disease-specific payments (DSP) for the entire disease duration. IP and COVID-19 cohorts were matched 1:1 on age, sex, and comorbidities (R package MatchIt, distance: GLM, method: nearest, caliper: 0.1). Inflation-adjusted payments to 2021 consumer-price index for IP vs COVID-19, and IP vs each severity of COVID-19, were estimated using generalized linear models with gamma distribution and log link. Results: Matched cohorts included 6332 Medicare [58.5% female, average age 75.3 (standard deviation (SD): 7.6), and 397 532 commercially-insured patients [57.6% female, average age 34.7 (SD: 16.7)] . Payments, both Commercial and Medicare, were significantly greater for COVID-19 patients than flu/pneumonia patients [Commercial ACP: COVID-19: $5060 (95% CI:$4923-$5197), IP: $ 3162 (95% CI: $3039-$3285), p < 0.001]. When comparing IP to COVID19 severity categories, adjusted incremental payments between IP and severe COVID-19 averaged $24 853 (95% CI $21 574 - $28 132) for DSP and $50 326 (95% CI $43 932 - $56 719) for ACP, respectively (p < 0.01). IP was also significantly less expensive than moderate COVID-19 for Commercial payers (but not for Medicare). IP was more expensive than mild COVID-19. Conclusions: The cost of care for severe COVID-19 patients significantly exceeded that for patients with influenza/pneumonia matched on age and comorbidities, for both Medicare and Commercial payers.",1.0,coronavirus,True

4525,"Background: Viagra Connect® (VC [a behind-the-counter, pharmacistsupervised sildenafil citrate]) was launched in the United Kingdom (UK) in April 2018 for erectile dysfunction (ED). Before and after its launch, a pharmacist education program of additional risk minimization measures (aRMM, as defined by EMA), comprising a training guide and a checklist regarding the safe use of VC was implemented. Using online resources, printed materials and in-store face-to-face sessions, pharmacists were trained to assess ED patients' suitability of VC and to advise them to see their doctors within 6 months. Objectives: As part of the aRMM evaluation, this survey assessed whether patients were evaluated appropriately and were advised by pharmacists, at the time of VC dispensing, to see their doctors. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional web-based structured survey. Patients who were dispensed VC at pharmacies across UK were screened for eligibility between October 2020 and June 2021. Statistical methods included counts and proportions. Results: A total of 412 patients who were dispensed VC at 96 pharmacies across UK were eligible. Of 303 (73.5%) eligible respondents, 297 (98.0%) completed the survey for analysis. In assessing the suitability of VC use, most of the respondents reported that at the time of VC dispensing their pharmacists asked questions regarding their blood pressure and heart conditions (91.9%), other illnesses (87.9%) and concomitant medications usage (86.5%). 82.2% of them reported being asked about ED and 71.7% of them recalled being asked if their doctor has said that they were not fit enough for physical and/or sexual activity. About half (51.2%) of the patients reported being advised by the pharmacist to see their doctor. A majority (65.0%) of the 297 respondents reported that they had either visited (19.2%) or planned to visit (45.8%) their doctor in near future. In addition, 68.7% of them said that they had received advice on lifestyle modifications to manage their ED-related health risks. Conclusions: This survey suggested that patients are being assessed appropriately for the suitability of VC, although only half received advice from pharmacists to see their doctors.

Individual ADR reports (patient, drug, reaction/ symptom and related information) from VA ADERS were evaluated for inclusion, and qualifying reports were matched to the VHA hospitalization and then paired with that patient's total hospitalization costs. Each ADR suspect medication was paired with the reported reactions, and hospitalization costs were summarized using mean, median, and measures of variance (SD and IQR). Costs were adjusted to 2018 US dollars using the Consumer Price Index. Results: In total, 5113 ADR reports (4880 patients) indicated the event resulted in hospitalization.

4540,"Background: Case-crossover studies have been proposed as a design suitable for brief exposure that causes a transient change in risk of an acute-onset disease. In pharmacoepidemiology, drug use is often chronic or successive, which leads to bias in case-crossover studies due to within-subject dependency. Objectives: In our simulation study, we show that bias due to withinsubject exposure dependency associated with chronic exposure can be removed by the Mantel-Haenszel method or our recently proposed weighting method. We also show that when some patients are censored due to switching to another drug after chronic use of a previous drug, bias occurs which is similar to that due to exposure time trends. Methods: In the simulation, we used case-crossover and case-timecontrol studies within a cohort of new drug users. Assume that every day, 60 patients enter the cohort after starting a drug of interest and continue it at least for 60 successive days. After the end of drug use, some patients are unexposed for at least 60 days. The other patients switch to another drug when the exposure period ends and are censored immediately. We varied the proportion who were censored from 0 to 30%. We assume that the rate of the outcome occurrence is 0.00005 per day during the unexposed post-exposure period and the rate is 0.0002 per day during the exposure period, so the rate ratio (RR) for the exposure is 4.0. We assume case-crossover and case-timecontrol studies are conducted to identify cases and control-subjects selected by the risk-set sampling with one case period and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30 or 60 control periods within the cohort during a time period of 200 days after the ""steady state"" is attained.

4543,"Background: In the United States, the legality of cannabis and other cannabis-derived products, including CBD, has changed over time at both the state and Federal levels. In June 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first cannabis-derived cannabidiol (CBD) human drug product (Epidiolex), currently indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis complex in patients ages 1 year. At the Federal level, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 removed ""hemp"" (i.e., cannabis plants and derivatives that contain no more than 0.3 percent THC on a dry weigh basis) from the Controlled Substances Act. Since then, there has been a proliferation of non-FDA approved products asserting to contain CBD. Objectives: To describe exposure and clinical patterns in cases involving CBD products documented by the US Poison Control Centers (PCCs) in children. Methods: We extracted closed human exposure cases involving CBD among children ages 2-12 years from the America's Poison Centers National Poison Data System (NPDS) between July 1, 2014, and June 30, 2021. We described cases by reason for exposure, exposure route, clinical effects, and medical outcomes, overall and by FDA approval status. Results: We identified 2352 CBD cases; 95.5% described exposure to non-FDA approved CBD and 92.2% to a single product. The most common exposure route was ingestion (95.5%); 14.5% of cases described related medical outcomes categorized as minor and 4.7% as moderate; 0.3% described major medical outcomes, none of these documented a temporal association with approved CBD exposures. The most frequent clinical effects included mild-to-moderate CNS depression (16.0%), vomiting (3.4%), other neurological effects (2.2%), and tachycardia (2.2%).

4551,"Background: For pregnancy safety and population-based studies, administrative health claims are indispensable tools for studying pregnancy and infant outcomes. However, the accurate ascertainment of pregnancy outcomes and estimating the start date of pregnancy are crucial to avoid misclassification of any drug exposure. Several pregnancy algorithms that utilize administrative health claims are available; however, their performance varies based on the pregnancy outcome, live birth vs. early pregnancy loss Objectives: To confirm cases identified by the spontaneous abortion (SAB) identification algorithm using the HealthCore (HC) internal algorithm and the Instant Health Data Patient Profile (IHD-PP) using the HealthCore Integrated Research DatabaseSM (HIRD). Methods: The Sentinel Cohort Identification and Descriptive Analysis tools (FDA, 2018) identified eligible pregnancies and women of childbearing age (10-49 years) between November 2015 to December 2020. Pregnancies ending in a spontaneous abortion were identified via developed and validated algorithms. Since the SAB identification algorithm could not estimate the start date of pregnancy, i.e., the last menstrual period (LMP), a harmonized gestational age (GA) of 140 days was used for all cases. The HC internal pregnancy algorithm and the IHD-PP were utilized to validate these cases. A lookup period of (À140 +7 days) was used to search for all codes  8 weeks and < 20 weeks. Furthermore, the HC algorithm considers the difference in days between the reported gestational week, i.e., Z3A code, and the event date. Results: Using the IHD-PP, 85% of SAB cases identified by the SAB identification algorithm were confirmed by the HC algorithm as actual SAB cases, while 15% were corrected as elective termination cases. In addition, the HC algorithm recalculated the GA among all the SAB cases using all available codes. For 90% of the SAB cases, GA was inferred as 88 GA days instead of the harmonized 140 days. While for 10% of the SAB cases, reported Z3A codes were allocated, thus their GA was adjusted based on the Z3A codes, with half of the cases corrected to 60 GA days and the other half corrected at 130 GA days. Conclusions: The performance of any pregnancy algorithm used to identify early pregnancy loss, such as spontaneous abortion, relies on the accuracy and completeness of the diagnosis coding within the administrative claims database. Moreover, the complexity associated with identifying spontaneous abortion muddles the estimation of GA and limits the assessment of the start of pregnancy date. All of which",1.0,case,True

4554,"Background: On 16 December 2021, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nMAbs) and antiviral medicines were offered as treatment to non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk of severe outcomes in England. Initially, the two most common therapeutic options were sotrovimab (nMAb) and molnupiravir (antiviral). Evidence for the approval of these medications primarily came from two phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials. Currently very little is known about real-world COVID-19 treatment effectiveness, especially in more vulnerable populations, such as those eligible for these treatments. In this cohort study, we outline the protocol of a target trial and emulate this using data from the OpenSAFELY platform. Objectives: To estimate the hazard of COVID-19 related hospitalization and death within 28 days associated with use of sotrovovimab or molnupiravir versus no-treatment, in non-hospitalized high-risk COVID-19 patients. Methods: With the approval of NHS England, we analyzed primary care data from patients in England using the OpenSAFELY platform linked to hospitalization, mortality, COVID-19 testing and COVID19 therapeutics records. We identified all non-hospitalized COVID19 patients between 16 December 2021 and 10 February 2022, matching patients who initiated sotrovimab and molnupiravir to eligible patients who did not initiate either therapy. Patients were followed from matched date of infection (to mitigate immortal time bias) until the earliest of outcome, death date, deregistration or 28 days post-index date. Propensity score weighting was used to account for confounding bias and treatment effects were obtained using Cox models. A key concern was unmeasured confounding and this was investigated using quantitative bias analysis, including evalues.",1.0,COVID-19,True

4561,"Background: Clinical trials have demonstrated that 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs), but not alpha-blockers, reduce the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-related surgery and acute urinary retention (AUR). However, a large gap exists between treatment duration in clinical trials and real-life situations. Objectives: To assess the long-term 15-year effectiveness of treatment with 5-ARIs versus alpha-blockers on the risk of progression to BPH related surgery and AUR. Methods: Analyzes for this study were conducted in May 2022. Using data from National Danish Health registries, we identified all newusers of 5-ARI or alpha-blocker monotherapy in Denmark, 1997- 2017. We defined an index date 180 days after date of first prescription, and included men who redeemed at least two prescriptions of either 5-ARI or alpha-blocker monotherapy before index date. We used multiple imputation to replace missing prostate specific antigen values. We followed patients from index date until BPH surgery/AUR, death, migration or end of follow-up, and compared the risk of progression in the two treatment groups, using standardized mortality ratio weighting (SMRW) adjusted Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and cumulative incidence function, treating death as a competing risk. We computed the risk of overall progression - defined as progression to BPH surgery or AUR - and the risk of progression to BPH surgery and AUR separately. Additionally, we estimated the relative risk reduction (RRR), the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed to treat (NNT). Results: We included 126 423 men who received 5-ARIs (n , 22 099) versus alpha-blockers (n ,"" 104 324).

Although the safety of the vaccine has been investigated worldwide, real-world safety data after the start of mass vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines at the workplace in Japan is lacking. Objectives: This real-time survey was aimed to assess adverse events following immunization (AEFI) with mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine in a real-world, workplace vaccination setting including three doses. Methods: The workplace vaccination at Keio University took place using the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine between June 26 and September 3, 2021, for the first two doses and between March 22 and May 28, 2022, for the additional third dose. The target of workplace vaccination included students, faculty members, and administrative staff of Keio University in Tokyo, totaling approximately 25 000 people. An online survey of suspected AEFI was conducted in the samples of students, faculty members, and administrative staff of Keio University Faculty of Pharmacy. Participants were requested to take four surveys during the seven-day follow-up period after each dose. Results: The maximum number of responses to the survey (301 participants) was obtained on Day 0 for the first dose. The majority of",1.0,COVID-19,True

A much larger number of respondents reported these systemic AEFIs for second dose, with a peak on Day 1. No noticeable difference in local reactions was seen between the first and second dose. While females reported more AEFIs after the first dose, the rate became closer as the number of male reports increased at the second dose. After stratification into young group aged 10-29 years and a middle-age group aged 30 years, reporting rate for the young group was higher than that for the middle age group after the first dose, but the difference decreased after the second dose. Most AEFIs were partially or completely resolved at Day 7 for both doses, except for known localized cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction for the first dose. More respondents used antipyretic analgesics for the second dose. The responses for the third dose are collecting at the time of abstract submission. Conclusions: This real-time survey among a Japanese workplace vaccination population confirmed that the safety profile of mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine in a real-world setting was similar to that derived from the premarketing randomized clinical trials. A high rate of AEFIs, including local and systemic reactions, were reported for both doses, especially for the second dose, albeit that these were not severe and probably resulted from the induced immune response.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Smaller studies of either type contributed negligibly. The reporting time course of the studies indicate that larger RCTs drive conclusive decisions regarding clinical benefit, with limited value from RWS. Conclusions: When evaluating therapies in future pandemics, we recommend: 1) large RCTs, especially the early deployment of platform studies; 2) any RWS should be large, with high quality design and analysis; 3) reporting standards and data standards for primary endpoints, explanatory factors and key subgroups should be improved; 4) appropriate incentives to enable access to patient-level data and; 5) an overall aggregate view of all available results should be available at any given time.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some health services including prescription of medications have been disrupted or changed in several countries. Yet, it is not known whether the pandemic has affected rates of prescription of cardiovascular drugs. Objectives: To describe the monthly trends in filled prescription of cardiovascular drug before (pre-COVID-19 era) and during the pandemic in Norway, and to estimate changes in prescription patterns following the COVID-19 pandemic among 1) the general population and 2) patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Methods: This was a population-based cohort study comprising adults ( 18 years old), registered as residents in Norway between 2018 to 2021. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease were identified using International Classification of Diseases codes (ICD-10) and cardiovascular medications were identified using ATC codes. Defined daily dose (DDD) per month per 1000 individuals were calculated for each study population from January 2018 to November 2020.

In this study, based on the adverse drug event active surveillance and assessment system-II(ADEASAS-II), we designed and established an automatic monitoring module for seizures from multiple aspects, including symptom descriptions, EEG examinations, neuroimaging, records of anti-epileptic drugs and diagnosis. Objectives: To establish an automatic monitoring module for epileptic seizures in hospitalized patients based on the ADE-ASAS-II, and to provide an efficient data mining tool for real-world research on large samples of epileptic seizures. Methods: This module used text classification technology and decision tree to mine the cases with seizures. First, collect keywords about seizures in guidelines, literature, spontaneous reports and electronic medical records. Screen and classify those keywords into four subsets as the criteria for the classification of decision tree nodes. Optimize the module by custom and shielding functions of ADEASAS-II with test data and determine the best keyword sets as the module's alarm rules. Then, expand the sample size for monitoring, check the stability of the module.Finally, concisely describe the gender, age, seizure types and causes of positive cases. Results: 5557 inpatients as the test data were manually reviewed. Through repeatedly tests, 37 alarm keywords in each branch of the decision tree were determined, and 12 keywords were entered to the EMR title shielding list. The positive predictive value of the module is 13.86%, and the recall rate is 100%. We monitored 14 549 hospitalized patients in May 2021 for validating the stability of the module, and 90 patients with epileptic seizures were screened by inclusion and exclusion criteria, with a PPV of 14.6% and an incidence rate of 0.62%. 53 out of 90 cases were acute symptomatic seizures, and the most frequent seizure type is tonic-clonic.

All cases were divided into three subgroups, including coagulation dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation dysfunction accompanied with thrombocytopenia, according to different mechanisms of coagulopathy. Results: Most of patients were male (69.84%) and over 60 years old (76.98%). The majority (95.52%) of ADR occurred within 15 days after medication, and lasted for no more than 14 days (95.48%). Patients with coagulation dysfunction alongside thrombocytopenia got a higher risk of bleeding(P < 0.001). We confirmed association of coagulopathy and 13 antibacterial types.

Methods: We used UK primary care records (CPRD AURUM), mapped to the OMOP CDM. All people aged  75 years, who were not previously infected with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 as of January 4 2021, were included. Subsequently, individuals were assigned to the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts based on administered COVID19 vaccination between 4 and 28 January 2021. Index date for vaccinated people was the vaccination date. For the unvaccinated cohort, index dates were randomly assigned following the distribution of the vaccinated cohort's index dates. Lasso regression was used to identify relevant covariates (e.g. conditions, drug exposures) for inclusion to large-scale PS. In addition, location, age, prior observation time, regional vaccination rates, diagnostic effort and COVID-19 incidence rates at index date were forced into the PS equation. We estimated three different PS, including different levels of location granularity: (1) no location, (2) regions or (3) GP practice. Following PS weighting, standardized mean differences (SMD) were used to assess covariate imbalance and compare OW and IPTW performance in minimizing observed confounding. Negative Control Outcomes (NCO) were used to detect residual confounding. Results: Vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts comprised 583 813 and 332 315 individuals, respectively. Prior to weighting, baseline characteristics were largely unbalanced between the cohorts, particularly age [SMD 0.31], location (region [0.14] and GP practice [0.74]) and GP visit counts. Overall, OW showed lower minimum SMD (median: 0.002; max: 0.025) for all covariates compared to IPTW (median: 0.004; max: 0.135). Assessing NCO, OW showed lower systematic error (26% NCOs associated with exposure) than IPTW in most scenarios (56%). Unweighted analyzes showed one-sided systematic error, with 74% NCOs being positively associated with vaccination. Conclusions: Our study found OW to be preferable over IPTW in minimizing observed and unobserved confounding in COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness research.

Methods: We used HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD) data to assess the time to reach an adequately powered sample size to assess the prevalence of MCMs in infants of women exposed to one of four multiple sclerosis or migraine drugs during pregnancy and the associated risk ratio (RR), assuming 1:2 matching. We used HIRD uptake information to calculate the estimated years required to reach the target sample size in a US ACD. As only a proportion of women who take a drug will enroll in an OPR, we assumed a range of recruitment rates (5, 10, 30, and 60 participants/year) to calculate the years required to reach the target sample size to detect the desired RR of 2.0 in an OPR. Results: To detect an RR of 2.0, 520 women/arm should be included for an adequately powered study sample. Through utilizing HIRD, the average uptake rate for dimethyl fumarate, a multiple sclerosis drug with the lowest uptake of all drugs examined, was 36 pregnancies/ year. Using an ACD, it would take 14.3 years to detect a RR of 2.0. It would take 52.0 and 17.3 years to reach adequate power to estimate a RR of 2.0, if 10 (27.8% of women treated) and 30 (83.3% of women treated) women, respectively, were recruited per year in an OPR. Conclusions: Assessing safety using either an ACD or an OPR will take more than a decade. Actionable safety data from ACDs may be available years before OPR data collection is complete, at which point the clinical landscape may have changed.

4655,"Background: Monitoring blood glucose in patients with diabetes is crucial to optimize glucose control and minimize the risk of diabetic complications, particularly hypoglycemia. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems automatically track blood glucose levels, which may help patients make more informed decisions regarding their glucose control. Most of the evidence on the effectiveness of CGM systems is in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, the indications and guidelines for CGM systems are evolving, with some experts recommending their use in all patients who use insulin, regardless of diabetes type. Thus, it is important to characterize the utilization of CGM systems and their impact on the rate of hypoglycemia in the real-world setting. Objectives: The objective of this ecological study was to assess temporal trends in CGM system use and evaluate whether these trends",1.0,,True

Methods: From January 1, 2016, through January 1, 2021, we created a series of 11 cohorts (one for every six months of calendar time) of patients with a diagnosis of T1D and a recent history of insulin use. Within each cohort, we assessed the prevalence of CGM system use and the rate of hypoglycemia in the six months after cohort entry. In the subset of patients with a recorded HbA1c during baseline, we measured the mean HbA1c during follow-up as an alternate measure of glycemic control. All analyzes were repeated in cohorts of patients with T2D and recent insulin use. Results: The prevalence of CGM use increased from 6.4% to 27.0% among patients with T1D from 2016 to 2021. However, the rate of diagnosed hypoglycemia slightly increased in patients with T1D from 2016 (11.2/1000 person-years) to 2021 (18.9/1000 person-years). In patients with a recorded HbA1c level at baseline, there was a decrease in the percentage of patients with severe hyperglycemia (HbA1c > 8.0%) during the study period, from 53.5% in 2016 to 40.8% in 2021. In contrast, the prevalence of CGM use was much lower in patients with T2D, though it increased from 0.6% in 2016 to 3.8% in 2021. Similarly to T1D, the rate of diagnosed hypoglycemia in T2D slightly increased from 30.6/1000 person-years in 2016 to 39.1/1000 person-years in 2021. However, the percentage of patients with severe hyperglycemia was relatively consistent in patients with T2D (33.4% in 2016 to 28.8% in 2021). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that the increase in the use of CGM systems in insulin users with T1D and T2D does not correlate with a reduction in the rate of hypoglycemia at the population level, but does correlate with a reduction in the rate of hyperglycemia in patients with T1D. More careful selection of patients who might most benefit most from CGM use is warranted.",0.0,,False

Methods: We conducted a national register-based study using data from the French National Health Insurance database (SNDS). This database provides anonymous detailed information on health insurance claims for 99% of the population living in France. We included all French women aged 13-49 years old who got an intra-uterine contraceptive dispensation in 2019. We collected information about sociodemographic characteristics and medical and gynecological history of women at the time of the device dispensation, and indicators of utilization one year after. Logistic regression was then performed to study the association between Cu-IUD/LNG-IUS dispensation and women's characteristics in a multivariate model using stepwise regression (selection criterion p < 0.05). Results: A total of 477 705 Cu-IUDs (user's mean age: 32.5 years [±7.3]) and 355 242 LNG-IUS (mean age: 36.4 [±7.7]) had been dispensed in 2019.

Women with newly inserted IUDs were recruited in 10 European countries (Austria, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Finland) via a network of approximately 1200 health care professionals. Cumulative incidence, crude and adjusted hazard ratios for expulsion were calculated. Results: Overall, 27 822 copper IUD users from the EURAS-LCS12 study were considered for this analysis. The most frequently used IUD shape was T/Y (73.7%) followed by chains (12.1%), Omega (10.5%), and balls (3.8%).

Objectives: To discuss the development and implementation of methods for evaluating device safety and effectiveness using electronic health record (EHR) and supply chain data for label extensions using a National Evaluation System for health Technology Coordinating Center's ablation catheter test-case as an exemplar. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Mercy and Mayo Clinic, 2 large multicenter US healthcare systems, in patients treated for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT) with one of two variants of an ablation catheter: ThermoCool SmartTouch (ST) or ThermoCool SmartTouch Surround Flow (STSF). Code-based algorithms were developed for efficient identification of cohorts and effectiveness outcomes, with accuracy assessed by comparing to clinician chart review and measured by positive predictive values (PPVs). Physician chart review was used to ascertain primary composite safety outcomes that comprised numerous individual components. Three criteria (hospitalization/readmission or emergency department visit within 7 days post ablation, index hospital stay 48 h, or codes for events that may not have been captured by the other 2 criteria) were used for flagging charts for physician review. Propensity scores were used for balancing baseline covariates. A federated model was used in which each healthcare system maintained its own data, and a combined treatment effect was estimated. Results: PPVs of code-based algorithms to identify cohorts and effectiveness outcomes ranged from 89%-95% and 87.5%-100%, respectively. A two-phase analytic approach was implemented by using different statisticians, first balancing covariates using propensity scores blinded to outcomes and subsequently conducting outcome analyzes of covariate-balanced data. Treatment effects across healthcare systems were averaged using a fixed-effects model for evaluating ThermoCool ST vs STSF to treat persistent AF. When covariate balance could not be achieved, study cohorts from both healthcare systems were combined and compared to an externally derived performance goal, an approach used for evaluating ThermoCool STSF to treat ischemic VT.

In women aged below 20 years, the cumulative expulsion rate was similar among females with BMI < 30 and BMI of 30 with overlapping CI (6.6 [5.7-7.6]/100 vs. 5.5 [3.19.8]/100). In women aged above 20 years, expulsion rates were higher in females with an BMI 30 compared to BMI < 30 (5.4 [4.9- 5.9]/100 vs. 3.3 [3.2-3.5]/100). The rate of expulsions was similar in nulliparous and parous adolescents (6.6 [5.7-7.5]/100 vs. 5.4 [3.1- 9.4]/100) but not in nulliparous and parous women (4.7 [4.4-5.2]/100 vs. 3.2 [3.0-3.4]/100) above 20 years of age. A multivariable Cox regression, stratified by age, shows that BMI (BMI 30; HR 1.7 [1.5- 1.9]) and gravidity (never pregnant; HR 1.6 [1.4-1.7]) are independent risk factors for expulsion in women aged above 20 years, but not in younger women (BMI 30; HR 0.8 [0.4-1.5] and never pregnant; HR 1.3 [0.8-2.0]). Conclusions: More expulsions were observed in females younger than 20 years, regardless of known risk factors. However, there is no increased risk in IUD expulsions among nulliparous or obese adolescents compared to parous and normal weight adolescents",1.0,case,True

4705,"Background: Recent studies have reported a substantial increase in the incidence of immediate release fentanyl (IRF) use in Spain from 2012 to 2017. Modeling IRF use and its dynamic associations with cancer incidence, will allow to put in context this increase in IRF use and future assessments on the effectiveness of risk minimization measures put in place by the regulatory authorities. Objectives: To estimate the dynamic relationship among immediate release fentanyl use and cancer incidence Methods: Monthly cumulative incidence for IRF and cancer were extracted from a nationwide electronic healthcare record database (BIFAP). A Vector autorregresive (VAR) model was constructed using the following step procedure: 1) split data into training data for modeling and test for validation 2) assessing for time series stationarity; 3) selecting lag-length; 4) building the VAR model; 5)assessing residual autocorrelation; 6) checking stability of the VAR system; 7) evaluating Granger causality; 8)impulse response analysis and forecast error variance decomposition 9)prediction performance with validation data. Results: The analysis showed a strong linear correlation between IRF and cancer (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.6 (95% CI: 0.5- 0.7). Two VAR models, VAR (2) and VAR (11) were selected and compared. All tests performed for both models satisfied assumptions for stability, predictability and accuracy. Granger causality revealed cancer incidence is a good predictor for IRF use. VAR (2) seemed to be slightly more accurate, according to the RMSE of the test data. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a robust and structured VAR modeling approach is useful to estimate dynamics associations involving IRF use and cancer incidence. Such information could be useful to put into context drug use and unsuccessful regulatory interventions, identifying enablers and barriers to implementation.",1.0,,True

4716,"Objectives: To assess whether the number of TCR patients identified and their characteristics differ when using three different time windows to link progressions to LOTs to determine refractory status. Methods: A population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted using the nationwide de-identified EHR-derived Flatiron Health database (January 2011 - July 2021). MM patients were classified as refractory to treatment based on a progressive event that occurred after a certain period of time after starting a LOT (start of the window) through < 60 days after the last dose of that LOT (end of the window). To see the effect of modifying the time window, three different starting points were used: 30 days after LOT start, 45 days, and 60 days. The end of the time window remained the same for all definitions (ie, < 60 days of last dose of that LOT). Baseline characteristics for all three cohorts including demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics were compared using descriptive statistics. Results: Using the 30-day, 45-day, and 60-day time window, 189, 185, and 180 TCR patients were selected, respectively.

4723,"Results: Outcome definition: eRMM surveys are often short and, in the authors' experience, the expectation of the PRAC is that each question will correspond to a variable, and responses to each variable will be presented separately in the results. Outcomes commonly cover 3 categories: receipt/awareness, knowledge/ understanding, and self-reported Behavior. The importance of these categories varies depending on the product and its risk profile and, with the objective of minimizing risks, one might want to focus on specific questions, e.g., knowledge of an important risk. In three studies, we proposed a hierarchy of questions via creation of composite outcomes (predefined group of core questions to which success criteria would apply). Composite scores were defined based on one outcome category or spanning all 3 categories. The endorsement of this approach by the PRAC was study-dependent, and what was accepted for one study was not necessarily endorsed for another, depending potentially on the type and level of the risk to be minimized. Success criteria: Success is commonly defined as 80% correct responses; however, the dilemma is whether this should be determined as 80% of participants providing correct responses to specific questions, or as participants responding correctly to 80% of all questions on average. Our experience showed that the former is more commonly used to determine success criteria. In circumstances where it is particularly important that a risk is well understood, additional thresholds (e.g., 90%, 100%) can be added. Conclusions: Our experience is that eRMM survey outcomes can be defined in different ways, according to the product and focus of the educational material, while the definition of success criteria across studies is more homogeneous.

The index date was defined as the date of 1L initiation. Patients were eligible if they had available radiological images in the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) with a CT or PET baseline scan within 8 weeks prior to index date. Differences in patient characteristics between patients with and without FU scan during 1L were assessed using standardized mean differences (SMD). OS between both cohorts was compared employing Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. To empirically assess the magnitude of ITB and the potential influence of imaging surveillance on OS outcomes, naive and ITB-adjusted estimates were compared using time-dependent and landmark models. Results: Overall, 4074 patients were eligible of which 2874 (70.5%) had 1 FU scan and 1200 (29.5%) did not have any FU scan after baseline. Patients with 1 FU scan had longer periods to initiate 1L after diagnosis, lower ECOG categories, were less likely to present with metastatic disease at initial diagnosis and were younger (all SMDs>0.1). In the naive analysis, median OS for patients with 1 FU scan was significantly longer with 16.1 (95% CI 15.1-17.0) versus 3.1 (95% CI 2.7-3.5) months for patients without FU scan (HR 0.34 [95% CI 0.32-0.37]).

Conclusions: Patients with 1 FU scan after 1L treatment initiation showed significant differences in baseline characteristics and OS compared to patients without FU scans, even after ITB adjustment.

Taking an approach in which we favor clinical face validity of risk factors over ""black box"" predictive analytic approaches, we search for risk factors for hemostasis-related surgical complications (HRSC), a difficult-to-predict outcome for which there is limited prior literature on risk factors. Methods: Retrospective study of the Premier Healthcare Database. Patients included for study underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy (VATL), laparoscopic right colectomy (LRC), or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on an inpatient setting between Oct-2015 and Feb-2020 (first,""index). For each cohort, a high-dimensional dataset of candidate risk factors was built based on all observed secondary diagnoses recorded during index and designated as """"present on admission""""; as this resulted in >5000 unique diagnoses, the Clinical Classification Software Refined (CCSR) was used to aggregate diagnoses into >500 clinically-meaningful categories. The outcome, HRSC, comprised hemorrhage, control of bleeding, and acute posthemorrhagic anemia. Candidate risk factors were fed into regularized logistic regression models with a 70%/30% train/test split for each cohort; clinically-plausible risk factors that were consistently significant predictors of HRSC across the 3 training models were then used in a final parsimonious model including sex, age, race, and payor; finally, the parsimonious model was applied to the test data to compare predicted risk with observed incidence of HRSC. Results: The study included 11 141 VATL, 20 156 LRC, and 121 547 LSG patients, in whom 7.5%, 7.8%, and 1.2% experienced HRSC, respectively. Ultimately, 9 clinically-plausible CCSR categories were identified as being statistically significant predictors across all 3 cohorts (e.g., coagulation and hemorrhagic disorders, malnutrition, alcoholrelated disorders, among others) In the parsimonious model applied to the test data, the observed incidence of HRSC was substantially higher in the top quintile vs. bottom quintile of predicted risk: LSG 2.05% vs. 0.53%, LRC 13.30% vs. 4.11%, VATS 12.49% vs. 5.04%.

4757,"assumptions about the underlying causal effect. This gives SCC model-based simulations unique advantages over structural equation model (SEM) based simulations in identifying the limitations of various analytic methods, but fundamental structural differences can make it difficult to translate, compare, and contrast SCC and SEM simulation findings for important pharmacoepidemiologic research questions. Objectives: Describe and demonstrate a method to map a set of SCC sufficient causes and variable values to SEM coefficients. Methods: The first step in mapping an SCC simulation to a SEM equivalent is identifying the causes of each relevant variable based on a directed acyclic graph. Next, saturated (or near-saturated) multivariable logistic regression models are fit to predict the probability of each variable conditional on its causes (or, if it has no causes, its overall probability). The coefficients of these logistic regression models are then used as parameters for a ""standard"" SEM-style simulation, resulting in a study population with similar confounding and overall treatment effect. To test this approach, we simulated a binary treatment X and a binary outcome Y in 500 000 individuals with three confounding variables (two binary, one continuous) using an SCC approach. We then fit saturated multivariable logistic regression models based on the directed acyclic graph created for the SCC model, and simulated another population of 500 000 individuals based on those coefficients. We compared treatment prevalence, outcome rates, and propensity score distributions between the two populations. Results: Of the 500 000 simulated individuals in the SCC population, 43.5% received X ,"" 1. Overall risk of the outcome Y was 27.2%, with a risk of 19.9% in those with X "", 1 and a risk of 36.6% in those with X ,"" 0.

Objectives: We illustrate the bias introduced when estimating the risk of rehospitalization within 90-days of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) if death is not accounted for as a competing event. We demonstrate how this validated algorithm can be used to reduce this bias. Methods: We use a 20% sample of Medicare claims (2007-2017) to identify patients with an incident admission for AMI. Patients were required to be 66+ years of age with employer-sponsored supplemental insurance. We compare 3 methods of estimating the risk of 90-day rehospitalization. The first method uses the true death data available in the Medicare enrollment data. We used cumulative incidence functions to estimate the risk of rehospitalization, accounting for death as a competing risk. The second method mimics scenarios where death data are unavailable, and patients are disenrolled from insurance coverage shortly after death. We used Kaplan Meier curves to estimate the risk of rehospitalization, treating death as noninformative censoring at the time of disenrollment. The third method applies the validated predictive algorithm to the Medicare claims where death date has been obscured. We used a predicted probability threshold of 0.99 to distinguish between plan disenrollment and death (sensitivity ,"" 0.92, specificity "", 0.90). We estimated the risk of rehospitalization accounting for predicted death as a competing risk. Results: We identified 12 753 patients with an index hospitalization for AMI (mean age ,"" 77.8 years). When accounting for death as a competing risk using validated death dates, the estimated 90-day risk of rehospitalization was 21.6% (20.8%, 22.3%). When mimicking a scenario where death is treated as non-informative censoring at the time of disenrollment, the estimated 90-day risk was 24.8% (23.9%, 25.6%). When using the algorithm to distinguish between death and disenrollment and accounting for predicted death as a competing risk, the estimated 90-day risk was 21.7% (21.0%, 22.4%). Conclusions: When estimating the risk of rehospitalization following AMI in a cohort of Medicare patients, applying a claims-based algorithm to predict death resulted in estimates that closely mirrored the estimates using validated death data.

Methods: We identified patients aged 20 or older with incident ASCVD event during 2016 to 2018 from the National Health Insurance Database (NHID) in Taiwan. NHI is a nation-wide insurance program that covers more than 99% of all citizens' health service reimbursement, including outpatient visits, hospitalizations and medication prescriptions. The discharge date of the first ASCVD hospitalization (,""the index hospitalization) during the study period was defined as the index date. In this example, we would like to describe the follow-up of ASCVD recurrence in these patients under different data conditions: (1) full-data-link; (2) index-facility-only. The former used all medical records in NHID for each patient while the later utilized records only from the hospital that was the same with the index hospitalization, thus mimic the single-institution scenario. We followed the patients from index date to occurrence of any ASCVD event, death, lost to follow-up or end of study. Lost to follow-up was defined as failure to return to any healthcare facility for 180 days or longer from the last medical visit. Other outcomes included median follow-up of any medical visits, lipid-lowering drug use, and lipid exam. Results: We included a total of 185 730 incident ASCVD patients. For full-data-link vs. index-facility-only scenarios respectively, there were 23 310 and 17 988 recurrent ASCVD events, corresponded to incidence rates of 95.8 and 72.0 per thousand patient-years, respectively. Under index-facility-only scenario, the incidence rate was underestimated by approximately 25%. Median follow-up days for any medical visit, lipid-lowering drug use, and lipid exam were 516 vs. 379, 432 vs. 377, and 296 vs. 293 days for full-data-link vs. indexfacility-only scenarios respectively, corresponded to percentage of under-estimation by 27%, 13% and 1%. When restricted to records from medical centers, the extent of under-estimation in index-facilityonly scenario decreased by 3%. Conclusions: Loss to follow-up due to lack of medical records from other institutions contributed to 25% under-estimation of ASCVD recurrence during a 3-year observation period among patients with ASCVD. Follow-up durations of any medical service and medication treatment but not lipid exam were under-estimated as well.

Objectives: To evaluate the validity of ambulatory status derived from US EHR-claims linked records as a proxy measure of MS disability, the correlation and test characteristics were determined in comparison to EDSS scores extracted from the unstructured notes of the EHR. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of an MS patient cohort within the US Optum Market Clarity de-identified EHR and claims linkage database.

EDSS scores recorded by clinicians in unstructured notes during the observation period were extracted using natural language processing (NLP). Ambulatory status was derived as a three level category from ICD diagnoses and HCPCS medical aids; 1) fully ambulatory, 2) walks with assistance, and 3) nonambulatory status. In sensitivity analyzes, information from unstructured notes on patients' ambulatory status extracted by NLP was included, and impact to algorithm performance was evaluated. Results: Of eligible patients (n ,"" 47051), mean age was 53 years and 76% were female. MS subtype was extracted using NLP for 18039 patients (38%) with 79% having relapse-remitting MS.

Based on the derived ambulatory status, 68% were fully ambulatory, 21% walked with assistance and 11% were non-ambulatory. Ambulatory status showed moderate correlation with EDSS (0.64, p < 0.001, Spearmans' rank). When categorizing EDSS< 4 as no walking impairment and EDSS4 as walking impairment, fully ambulatory status showed 84% sensitivity and 72% specificity in categorizing walking status per EDSS. Including ambulatory status recorded in unstructured notes led to modest improvements in correlation with EDSS (0.68, p < 0.001), and higher specificity (85%) in classifying walking status per EDSS, but with lower sensitivity (74%). Conclusions: Considering the absence of EDSS scores in claims and rarity in EHR databases, ambulatory status may be a relevant and useful proxy indicator of MS disability for the purposes of confounding adjustment for comparative analyzes in EHR or claims based studies.""",0.0,,False
4779,"Background: We identified little consistency in fracture outcome definitions in a prior scoping review of studies that utilized administrative claims data to estimate drug effects on fracture risk. Heterogeneity in outcome definitions complicates the comparison of results across studies; outcome misclassification can lead to biased estimates of fracture risk. Objectives: To compare fracture rates between hip fracture definitions. Methods: We linked emergency department (ED) and hospitalization (inpatient) claims data for the population of Ontario, Canada to compare differences in hip fracture outcome identification in a cohort of 113 452 long-term oral bisphosphonate users (2003/04-2016/12). Six definitions were compared that used diagnostic (ICD-10: S72.0x, S72.1x, S72.2x) only, or diagnostic and procedural (fixation, reduction, replacement) codes. Our definitions, from most to least inclusive were: 1) one ED or inpatient diagnosis, 2) one inpatient diagnosis, 3) one ED diagnosis, 4) ED or inpatient: one diagnosis and one procedure within 7 days of first claim, 5) one diagnosis and one procedure during the same hospitalization, 6) one diagnosis and one procedure in ED. The most inclusive definition (1) served as the referent group for comparisons. Fracture incidence censored on death and end of follow-up (2020/04) was the primary outcome. Incidence rates and number of hip fractures were used to quantify comparisons. Results: The number of fractures identified ranged from 96 (definition 6) to 9601 (definition 1). Definitions that only considered diagnoses in either hospital (definition 2) or ED (definition 3) identified 91%-93% of fractures identified by definition 1. Interestingly, definitions that required procedural codes in addition to diagnostic codes within hospital only (definition 5), or hospital and ED (definition 4), captured only 87% of fractures relative to definition 1. At the extreme, < 1% of hip fractures identified using diagnostic codes in ED or inpatient were captured by diagnostic and procedural codes in ED (definition 6). Differences in definitions translated into differences in fracture incidence (per 10 000 person-years): 93.3, 89.8, 85.3, 79.5, 79.2 and 0.93 by each respective definition.

Objectives: To compare the performance of matching weights (MW), overlap weights (OW), inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW), and average treatment effect in the treated weights (ATTW) in the context of seven treatment groups. Methods: We used US Medicare fee-for-service data (2012-2017) to evaluate the risk of opioid overdose among individuals on long-term opioid therapy initiating one of eight skeletal muscle relaxants. Patients were allocated to seven treatment groups based on an initiated skeletal muscle relaxant and followed from the day after initiation until outcome occurrence, change in therapy, death, or end of data for a maximum of 365 days. PSs were estimated as a function of 97 baseline covariates and used to calculate weights. Weighted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to quantify hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% robust confidence intervals (CIs) for six treatment groups relative to cyclobenzaprine. We also conducted 1:1 PS matching for six pairwise comparisons with cyclobenzaprine as the reference group. Target estimands, statistical efficiency, and HRs with 95% CIs were compared across the four weighting methods and PS matching. Results: The study included 207 364 eligible patients with treatment group sizes ranging from 3110 initiating chlorzoxazone/orphenadrine to 77 165 initiating cyclobenzaprine before adjustment. All methods balanced measured covariates with no standardized differences > 0.10. MW and OW standardized all treatment groups to the smallest group (chlorzoxazone/orphenadrine), IPTW standardized all treatment groups to the largest group (cyclobenzaprine), and ATTW and pairwise 1:1 PS-matched cohorts most closely resembled the chosen reference group (cyclobenzaprine) with respect to measured covariates. All approaches suggested an increased risk of opioid overdose for baclofen relative to cyclobenzaprine, with HRs and 95% CIs spanning 2.70 (95% CI 2.06, 3.55) for OW to 3.29 (95% CI 2.44, 4.44) for 1:1 PS matching, and no differences in risk for the other five treatments. Conclusions: In this head-to-head empirical comparison of seven treatments, the four evaluated PS-based weighting methods yielded similar HRs and 95% CI coverage. Nevertheless, the generalizability of our findings may be limited to situations where the distribution of treatment effect modifiers, if they exist, does not differ across treatment groups.",1.0,,True

We described the patient-level characteristics, initial treatment regimen for incident BC, subsequent treatment for BC recurrence, and incidence rates (IR) of recurrence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Among 66 376 women initially identified with stage I-III BC and surgery within 90 days, 9.4% were excluded based on above prespecified treatment and diagnostic parameters.

Pneumonia was identified in any position from inpatient claims only (definition 1), outpatient claims only (definition 2), and inpatient or outpatient claims (definition 3). Crude and adjusted sequence ratio (cSR/aSR) were calculated separately under traditional and rate-based SSA frameworks. Within the traditional framework, cSR was the ratio of the number of patients with first pneumonia occurred after the index date to the number of patients with first pneumonia occurred before the index date; Within the ratebased framework, cSR was the ratio of the number of pneumonia diagnoses after the index date to the number of pneumonia diagnoses before the index date.

Objectives: We developed a summary Elixhauser comorbidity score (S-Elixhauser) to predict 30-day, in-hospital and 1-year mortality in older adults using the 38 comorbidities developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and compared its performance with existing comorbidity measures in older patients and in three disease-specific populations (heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes mellitus). Methods: This retrospective cohort study used Medicare claims for fee-for-service beneficiaries from 2017 to 2019 and included Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized in 2018 (n ,"" 899 844) and three disease-specific hospitalized patient cohorts. We used logistic regression and separately derived weights for 38 comorbidities to predict 30-day, in-hospital and 1-year mortality. We internally validated and calibrated the S-Elixhauser, and compared its performance against the individual Elixhauser comorbidity indicators (38 comorbidities), the AHRQ-derived weighted summary score, the Charlson comorbidity indicators (17 comorbidities) and the Charlson summary score in predicting 30-day, in-hospital and 1-year mortality, using cstatistics. Results: The S-Elixhauser score was well-calibrated and showed modestly greater discrimination in predicting 30-day mortality (c-statistic 0.705, CI 0.703-0.707) than the AHRQ Elixhauser score (c-statistic 0.688, CI 0.686-0.690), the Charlson comorbidity indicators (c-statistic 0.696, CI 0.694-0.698) and the Charlson summary score (c-statistic 0.690, CI 0.6880.693), but less discrimination than the individual Elixhauser comorbidity indicators (0.711, CI 0.709-0.713). Similar findings were observed for in-hospital and 1-year mortality. In three disease-specific populations, the S-Elixhauser score performed equally well or better than the AHRQ Elixhauser score and both Charlson comorbidity measures.

4808,"Background: Pharmacoepidemiological studies are often biased by confounding by indication when utilizing real-world data. To circumvent such bias, researchers often choose to restrict their study sample to individuals with a particular drug indication (i.e., indication-based sampling). This strategy may, however, be problematic. Objectives: We here showcase how indication-based sampling may exaggerate, rather than alleviate, bias in studies examining drug effects. Methods: We describe bias amplification under indication-based sampling, which we highlight using simulations of varying levels of confounding and applied examples, overall and in relation to effectheterogeneity. Results: If we allow the indication to vary freely, the indication will explain some of the differences in drug use. However, if we constrain the indication, a larger share of the variation in drug use must be due to some other factor (e.g., an unmeasured confounder). In simulations, we find that indication-based sampling is more biased than alternative approaches (e.g., regression adjustment) to control for confounding by indication. This suggests that indication-based sampling is often not warranted, especially since the approach also depletes the sample size. Stratum-specific effects are, however, important to consider when effect-heterogeneity can be assumed or the research question under study concerns the drug effect in a specific population (e.g., it is relevant to stratify by/restrict to individuals with depression in studies of the effect of antidepressants on suicide). Nonetheless, it can be detrimental to perform indication-based sampling when there is no reason to expect effect-heterogeneity (e.g., it is not warranted to stratify by/restrict to individuals with epilepsy in studies of antiseizure medication teratogenicity). Conclusions: Restricting a study sample to a particular drug indication should not be considered unbiased or an optimal strategy to address confounding by indication. In fact, indication-based sampling is generally more biased than alternative modes of analysis. We suggest that future studies using real-world data stay wary of bias amplification when considering drug indication, in spite of recent enthusiasm for active-comparators and target trial emulation.",1.0,case,True

Three approaches were used to identify UC events: 1) at least one claim with a UC diagnosis during the follow-up period; 2) at least two claims (separated by 30 days) with a UC diagnosis during the follow-up period; and 3) at least two claims (separated by 1 day) with a UC diagnosis during the follow-up period. Results: After applying the inclusion criteria, the number of patients at risk was 46 678 985 in the general population, 401 056 cancer patients who underwent any treatment, and 27 166 cancer patients who received ICI treatment.

Methods: A literature search was performed in Ovid (no time limits) to find sources that reported ICD codes for at least one disease of interest. Articles were screened in two levels (title/abstract; full text). Comparisons between ICD code lists and evaluation of discrepancies in patient disease classification were performed in SAS Version 9.4.

Objectives: The objective of this literature review was to investigate in how far PK/PD modeling is utilized in observational studies particularly on glucose-lowering, and antiarrhythmic drugs. Methods: A Systematic Literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and WEB OF SCIENCE was conducted from January 2010 to 2first February 2021. To calculate the utilization of PK/PD modeling in observational studies, we followed two search strategies. In the first strategy, we screened a 1% random set from 95 672 studies on glucose-lowering and antiarrhythmic drugs on inclusion criteria. In the second strategy, we evaluated the percentage of studies in which PK/PD modeling techniques were utilized. Subsequently, we divided the total number of included studies in the second search strategy by the total number of eligible studies in the first search strategy. Results: The comprehensive search of databases in addition to the manual search of included references yielded a total of 29 studies included in the qualitative synthesis of our systematic review. Nearly all 29 studies had utilized a PK model, whereas only two studies developed a PD model to evaluate the effectiveness of medications. Sixteen out of 29 studies (55.1%) used a PK/PD model in the observational setting to study effect modification. The utilization proportion of PK/PD modeling in observational studies was calculated as 0.42%. Conclusions: Overall, there is a lack of synergy between clinical pharmacology and pharmacoepidemiology. Although pharmacoepidemiology started mainly quantifying adverse reactions and their risk factors after marketing, the increasing size of health care databases nowadays stimulates comparative studies on effectiveness. Unfortunately, such databases rarely include information that can be used for personalized fine-tuning of results within various risk groups. Especially large-sized observational studies make only limited use of information on effect modification from PK/PD studies.

Two other methods were implemented: the weighted sum of the difference of LE at the age of diagnosis in the general population obtained from life tables and the observed LE with a parametric gamma model adjusted on age and sex (method 2) or with linear extrapolation of a logit-transformed curve of the survival ratio between simulated general control population from life tables and MM study population (method 3). Results: A total of 26 357 incident patients were diagnosed with MM between 2014 and 2019 (mean age: 69.7 years) including 10 563 (40.1%) who died during follow-up (mean age: 76.3 years).

Conclusions: The mean number of YLL for MM patients varies between 10.9 and 13.3 years according to the method of estimation. The method 1 is widely used in the literature due to its simplicity and allows comparisons with other reference studies however it applies only to deceased patients and tends to overestimate YLL.

Participants included in this study had to fulfill American Thoracic Society criteria for ATT interruption (alanine transaminase [ALT]5 times upper limit of normal [ULN]/ALT3 times [ULN] and symptomatic). Causality assessment by a multidisciplinary expert panel review served as the reference standard for the analysis. The panel ranked potentially implicated drugs as certain, probable, possible, or unlikely causes, guided by the World Health Organization Uppsala Monitoring Center causality assessment criteria. The RUCAM was performed for each potentially implicated drug. We calculated sensitivity and specificity of the RUCAM in identifying a probable/certain drug cause for liver injury. Results: We included 48 participants. All were HIV positive. Thirtyseven were taking ATT and 38 ART, with 27 taking concomitant ATT and ART. There was a median of 6 potentially hepatotoxic drugs per case (range 4 to 7). Sensitivity and specificity of the RUCAM in identifying a probable/certain drug cause of liver injury compared with expert panel review was 11% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2%-28%) and 85% (95% CI 62%-97%) respectively.

Finally, the adjusted Rand index, a standard clustering metric, was calculated. To further evaluate the proposed improved model against the original model, both were used to cluster an additional dataset. The resulting clusters were evaluated using an additional set of ""Clinician-in-the-loop"" metrics. These can be categorized into intruder detection metrics and in-depth metrics. Intruder detection quantifies the coherence of the clusters by measuring how well a domain expert can identify an intruding report or AE term added to a cluster. The in-depth assessment had domain experts attempt to label each cluster with a clinical theme. These were used to quantify the fraction of clusters with recognizable clinical themes, the extent to which clinical themes were repeated and how well the clusters covered the safety profile of the drug. Results: The automated metrics showed that the modified version of vigiGroup was more effective in finding all the reports related to a clinical theme.

4903,"Background: Analgesics are the most widely used class of drugs and are reported to associated with various hypersensitive reactions. Analgesics induced hypersensitivity reactions constitute nearly 10%-15% of all reported adverse drug reactions. Objectives: To assess the pattern of hypersensitive reactions associated with analgesic therapy among hospitalized patients. Methods: This ambispective observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital of southern India. The patients who developed hypersensitive reactions following analgesic use were identified and details were collected and documented. For the identified hypersensitivity reactions, preventability using Schumock and Thornton scale, and predictability using Rawlins and Thompson scale was assessed. Results: A total of 212 patients were identified who developed hypersensitive reactions following analgesics according to our study observations. A majority of patients were females (n ,"" 119, 56.1%). Tramadol (n "","" 88, 41.5%) was the most frequent causative agent in the development of hypersensitive reaction, followed by acetaminophen (n "","" 68, 32%), diclofenac (n "","" 20, 9.4%), aceclofenac (n "","" 19, 8.9%), aspirin (n "","" 6, 2.8%), naproxen (n "","" 5, 2.3%), mefenamic acid (n "","" 3, 1.4%), codeine (n "","" 2, 0.9%) and morphine (n "","" 1, 0.4%).

A majority (n "","" 171, 80.6%) of the hypersensitive reactions were predictable but not preventable. Conclusions: The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions to analgesics in hospitalized patients is high. As analgesics are accessible to general public as over-the-counter medications, the frequency of hypersensitive reactions may be still higher. Therefore, it requires careful monitoring and reporting of hypersensitive reactions to analgesics among general public.""",0.0,,False

4909,"Background: Disproportionality analysis, a way to quantify unexpectedness, is the standard approach in statistical signal detection. To improve signal detection, information can be leveraged from similar drugs. By using safety profiles of chemically similar drugs, the aim is to find signals earlier as chemical similarity gives additional support resulting in less case safety reports required to detect signals. Furthermore, leveraging chemical similarity may propose a mechanism of action for the suspected Adverse Event (AE). Objectives: Predict American Structured Product Label (SPL) changes using machine learning based on known AE of structurally similar drugs and disproportionate reporting rates. Methods: To create a dataset of drug-AE pairs, SPLs were mined with advanced natural language processing algorithms. We excluded combination products, biologics, herbals, vaccines, as well as dermatological and ophthalmic drugs. A subset of the included drugs were test drugs which had a label change to their SPL within a defined time window. The dataset had 3528 drug-AE pairs, composed of positives (label changes) and negatives. Drugs were chemically represented as Morgan fingerprints of radius 2 and their similarity was computed using Dice coefficient. The Information Component (IC) was used as a measure of disproportionality between observed and expected reporting of drug-AE pairs. Features for the model included chemical similarity, presence of an AE in the comparator label, and IC values computed in VigiBase, the World Health Organization's global database of reported AE of medicinal products. The machine learning model chosen was a random forest, trained and evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. Results: Using only positive IC025 without a machine learning model as a baseline model resulted in an f1 score of 0.41 with precision of 0.84 and recall of 0.26. Feeding IC values into the random forest model resulted in an f1 of 0.64, with precision (0.64) and recall (0.66). If only chemical similarity and comparator label information is used with the random forest model, f1 of 0.66 is found with similar precision (0.66) and recall (0.68). Both random forest models perform much better in recall than the baseline model. Best results are found when combining IC and chemical information, resulting in an f1 of 0.74 with precision of 0.72 and recall of 0.76. Other chemical representations and machine learning models performed similarly. Conclusions: When only using IC values, recall is low. Considering drug chemical similarity or IC values in a machine learning model improves prediction of label changes. Best performances are achieved when chemical information and disproportionality are used together, showing that chemical information could support timely signal detection.",1.0,case,True

4912,"Background: The use of anti- vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) treatment had been reported to increase the risks of thromboembolic events. Therefore, the use of anti-VEGFs for patients with colorectal cancers (CRC) raised the concern of the increased risk of retinal vein occlusion (RVO), an ocular disease which caused by embolism or venous stasis. This study aimed to evaluate the risk of RVO in patients with CRC treated with anti-VEGFs. Objectives: To determine the association of anti-VEGF use and RVO in colorectal cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study by analysing the data from Taiwan's Cancer Registry and National Health Insurance database (NHID). We selected a cohort of patients newly diagnosed of CRC from 2011 to 2017 and received anti-VEGFs. New case was identified based on 12 months' washout period. We defined the date of first prescription of anti-VEGF as index date. Four patients diagnosed with CRC but without an exposure of anti-VEGF were randomly selected as the control group. The study outcome was the incidence of RVO defined by the ICD-9-CM (362.35 and 362.36) or ICD-10-CM codes (H3481 and H3483). Patients were followed from their index date until the occurrence of RVO, death, or the end of the study period. Covariates included patients' age at index date, sex, calendar year of CRC diagnosed, stage of CRC and comorbidities related to RVO. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs with adjustments of all covariates to compare the risk of RVO between anti-VEGF group and control group. Results: We identified a total of 6285 patients in anti-VEGF group and 37250 patients in control group with the mean age of 59.49 ± 12.11 and 63.88 ± 13.17 years respectively. The incidence rates were 1.06 per 1000 person-year for anti-VEGF group and 0.63 per 1000 person-year for control group. There was no statistically significant difference for the RVO risk between anti-VEGF and control group (HR, 2.21; 95% CIs, 0.87-5.61). Conclusions: Our results indicated no association between the use of anti-VEGF and the occurrence of RVO among CRC patients, although the crude incidence rate of RVO was higher in patients receiving anti-VEGF comparing with control patients.

4918,"Background: Ginkgo Biloba (GB) is a herbal product used to enhance cognitive functions, blood flow improvement, as an antioxidant, and for its antiplatelet activity. Some studies showed that GB may increase the risk of bleeding by impairing platelet aggregation. Objectives: This review aims to assess the relatedness of the potential drug-herbal interaction between GB and NSAIDs as a part of drug - herbal interaction assessment project initiated by the Saudi Food and Drug Authority. Methods: This safety review utilized several sources. First, a systematic literature search was performed in Cochrane, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Also, a search was performed in Adis Insight database, and the Natural Medicines Database. The search included published work from inception to February 2022 for eligible English publications with appropriate keywords (Table 1). Moreover, a search in the World Health Organization (WHO) database (VigiBase) was conducted in February 2021 to retrieve all reported cases worldwide of potential drug-herbal interaction between GB and NSAIDs. The assessment was performed and guided by the Strength-of-Recommendation Taxonomy tool. The interaction rate was determined based on the level of significance. Results: We found four published case reports, one randomized clinical trial (RCT), and 2 observational studies that reported GB interaction with NSAIDs. Case reports retrieved from the literature were reported with ibuprofen (n ,"" 1), Aspirin (n "","" 3), and rofecoxib (n "","" 1). Case reports suggest a temporal pharmacodynamics interaction between GB and NSAIDs, resulting in bleeding. One of the cases reported a temporal fatal intracerebral mass bleeding in a healthy subject who used to take GB and started ibuprofen 4 weeks prior to his death with no other confounders. In the observational studies, the researchers reported some cases of bleeding with the concomitant administration of GB and NSAIDs. However, the RCT that included a small sample size did not find a clinically or a statistically significant increased risk of bleeding with the concomitant use of aspirin and GB in adults. The search in VigiBase revealed 13 interactions between GB with aspirin (n "","" 7), meloxicam and naproxen (n "","" 1), diclofenac (n "","" 2), and ibuprofen (n "","" 3). Overall, the interaction severity was high and caused lifethreatening reactions. The interaction rate was moderate required avoiding the combination, and the likelihood of occurrence was probable.

4921,"Background: Advances in the treatment of cancer in young patients have led to great improvements in life expectancy. However, treatment with chemo or radiotherapy causes reduction of sperm counts often to azoospermic levels that may persist for several years or be permanent. Objectives: To quantify disproportionate reporting (Disp-Rep) for the risk of drug-associated oligospermia/azoospermia for 41 clinically approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in 2 groups: 1) Antiangiogenic (AA) TKIs; 2) Non-anti-angiogenic (NAA) TKIs. Methods: We used the AERS and VigiBase databases, with data up to Dec 2021 and Mar2022 for analysis respectively. Cases of oligospermia and azoospermia were identified using MedDRA (v24.1) and the high-level-term (HLT) `Spermatogenesis and semen disorders' (SSD). Empirical Bayes Geometric Means (EBGM) with 90% CI were calculated to quantify Disp-Rep. We considered the lower bound of the 90% CI, EB05 > 2 as the threshold for claiming an observation of Disp-Rep. We studied 3 groups of drugs: 1) Positive control group (non-TKIs associated with oligospermia/azoospermia: sulfasalazine, colchicine and cisplatin) and two groups of TKIs: 2) AA TKIs & 3) NAA TKIs. Drugs were identified by non-proprietary name. Results: We retrieved 104 SSD cases in AERS and 83 in VigiBase. In AERS, Disp-Rep with EBGM [90% CI, EB05-EB95] was confirmed for the positive control group: cisplatin 4.32 [3.29-5.64], and colchicine 3.80 [2.40-5.97] and in VigiBase for sulfasalazine 3.15 [2.05-4.68]. In AERS, Disp-Rep was confirmed for only 1 of 25 NAA TKIs: ibrutinib 3.52 [2.37-5.13]. No Dis-Rep was found for the rest of NAA TKIs: afatinib, alectinib, avapritinib, bosutinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, dabrafenib, dasatinib, entrectinib, erlotinib, fostamatinib, gefitinib, gilteritinib, imatinib, lapatinib, lorlatinib, nilotinib, osimertinib, pemigatinib, pexidartinib, pralsetinib, tucatinib and zanubrutinib.

The analysis in VigiBase database yielded similar results. Conclusions: Ibrutinib (NAA TKI) was the only drug among the 41 different TKIs studied with Disp-Rep for oligospermia/azoospermia in both databases.

Objectives: To present the current status of polypharmacy in AEs reports of the elderly over 65 years using the Korea adverse events reporting system (KAERS) database. Methods: We used the KAERS database, which is a nationwide database of AEs reports from 2016 to 2020. Polypharmacy was defined as administered 5-9 drugs and administered more than 10 drugs was defined as excessive polypharmacy. Only cases reported by the regional pharmacovigilance centers were included, and the timing and duration of drug administration were not considered. Baseline characteristics, proportion of reports on a certain number of drugs by age group and reported medications coded by anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) first level was analyzed according to polypharmacy classification. Results: Among the total of 258 078 elderly patients reports from 2016 to 2020, 243 640 reports (94.41%) administered 1-4 drugs, 12 825 reports (4.97%) administered 5-9 drugs, and 1613 reports (0.63%) administered over 10 drugs per one report. The mean number of drugs per elderly report in the KAERS database during the study period was 1.63.

People with atopic eczema are prescribed OCS in different patterns (e.g., continuously or intermittently) which may affect how fracture preventive care is prescribed. Objectives: To determine if people receiving intermittent OCSs are less likely to receive adequate fracture-preventive care than people receiving the same cumulative OCS dose continuously and, if so, if this affects fracture risk in these people. Methods: We conducted a nationwide cohort study using routinely collected UK general practice data (January 1998 to January 2020). We identified 20 680 individuals aged 66+ with atopic eczema who had received at least 450mg prednisolone equivalent dose in 6 months. Of these, 13 240 were intermittent and 7440 were continuous OCS users. We estimated hazard ratios from Cox regression for the outcome of fracture preventive care (prescriptions for bisphosphonates, calcium, vitamin D), and secondary outcome of major osteoporotic fractures, comparing those with continuous OCS use to the rate of those with intermittent OCS use. Results: People prescribed continuous OCSs had higher rates of fracture preventive care than those prescribed OCSs intermittently (age, sex, deprivation and comorbidity adjusted HR 5.11; 95% CI 4.63- 5.63). Effect estimates were attenuated in sensitivity analyzes using different continuous/intermittent OCS definitions, however a strong positive association between continuous use and fracture preventive care prescribing remained.

Methods: Side-by-side Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) disproportionality analyzes were performed on the manufacturer-maintained database of adverse event reports for insulin lispro. Lot-level analyzes included insulin lispro lots for reports submitted between October 2013-October 2018 (lots with new purification process); insulin lispro lots for reports between January 2008-October 2013 (historic); and lots for reports between October 2013-October 2018 (concurrent, including both old and new lots). MedDRA PT of interest included changes in insulin effect and hypersensitivity (including immunogenicity and injection site reactions). New lots compared to concurrent and historic lots separately.

To facilitate patient safety, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) has issued guidelines for the management of antituberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity (ATH), however the extent to which Moroccan physicians comply with these guidelines in daily practice is unknown. Objectives: To determine the factors that may be associated with compliance with the ATH management guide in primary care facilities in Casablanca Methods: A cross-sectional study of primary care facilities in Casablanca between March and July 2020 was conducted. Self-reported data regarding the daily practice around diagnosis, management and rechallenge of anti-tuberculosis medications following ATH was collected from general practitioners via a self-administered questionnaire. Selfreported practice was compared with the recommendations in the American Thoracic Society (ATS) ATH management guidelines and physicians following at least 75% of the ATS ATH recommendations were considered to be complaint with the guidelines for each area (diagnosis, management, rechallenge). Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with guideline compliance. Results: Of the 125 physicians practicing in the public primary care structures of Casablanca, 93 agreed to participate in our study. The average age of the participants was 41.58 ± 8.75 years with a mean of 10.56 ± 5.96 years of practice. Across all areas, 32.6% of physicians were complaint with the ATS guideline. In terms of diagnosis, 89.9% of physicians complied with the guidelines for diagnosis of symptomatic patients but this reduced to 50.6% for diagnosis of asymptomatic patients. Initial management guidelines for ATH were followed by 75.3% of physicians. Rechallenge practices were consistent with the ATH management guideline for 43.2% of physicians. In multivariate analysis, except for having received TB training in the previous 12 months (OR , 3.22; 95% CI ,"" [1.18;8.94]), no other factors (Gender, age, place and years of practice) were statistically associated with compliance with the ATH management guidelines. Conclusions: This cross-sectional study showed that in general the management practices for ATH in primary care facilities in Casablanca do not conform to the ATS guidelines. We found that education on management of TB was associated with increased compliance indicating that physician education is in strategy likely to increase physician management at ATH in primary care.""",1.0,area,True

4957,"Background: In clinical practice, kidney function (i.e., glomerular filtration rate, GFR) is often estimated (eGFR) using the CKD-EPI formula. The formula is derived from large studies comparing measured GFR with a number of clinical characteristics of which serum creatinine, sex, age, and race (black vs. non-black) have proven to be significant. The correction for race implies that people of black race will have a greater eGFR than non-black people with similar serum-creatinine, which may affect decisions on medical intervention, referrals, and drug dosing. To improve health equity a new refitted CKD-EPI formula, that does not include race has been proposed. Objectives: To estimate and compare the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the predominantly non-black Danish population using the original and refitted CKD-EPI formula. To describe the characteristics and 1-year mortality in the resulting CKD populations. Methods: Using nationwide Danish population-based registries, we identified all adults in Denmark on 1 January 2019; extracted all their outpatient creatinine tests in 2016-2018 from biochemical databases; computed eGFR based on the original and refitted formulas assuming non-black race; and identified individuals with CKD. CKD was defined as having eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 measured twice at least 90 days apart. We computed the prevalence of CKD using the original and refitted formulas and described the distribution of CKD stage, age, sex, and the prevalence of diabetes, liver disease, chronic pulmonary disease, connective tissue disease, heart failure, thromboembolic disease, and cancer within these populations. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate 1-year mortality among persons with CKD, overall and by CKD stage. Results: Among 4 768 234 adults, we identified 261 625 persons with CKD (prevalence: 5.5%) using the original formula, but only 198 367 (prevalence: 4.2%) using the refitted formula. The distribution of CKD stage, age, and sex were similar within the two CKD-populations. The CKDpopulation identified by the refitted formula had slightly higher comorbidity burden; most noticeably diabetes (27% vs 24%). The 1-year mortality was higher using the refitted formula (8.9%) than using the original (7.9%). The difference in mortality was most predominant for CKD stage 3a and decreased with increasing stage both in absolute and relative terms. Conclusions: Compared with the original CKD-EPI formula, the refitted formula reduced CKD prevalence by 24% and resulted in a population with a slightly increased comorbidity burden and mortality.",1.0,clinical,True
4958,"Heart Failure (HF) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) separately, few studies have assessed the distribution of concurrent CKD and HF by REMs and sex in RWD. Objectives: To describe variation across racial and ethnic groups among patients with concurrent CKD and HF. Methods: The TriNetX (USA) electronic medical records (EMR) network from 2005 to February 2022 was used to retrieve REMs counts for patients in the US with HF and CKD concurrently. ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes were used to identify subjects for CKD and HF diagnoses. TriNetX is broadly representative of the US population and captures 54 909 750 US subjects with REMs data. The REMs categories are recorded according to Health Level 7 (HL7) including not Hispanic White, Black, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander subgroups; along with Hispanic ethnicity (all races). Results: In TriNetX, patients with concurrent CKD and HF was 895 900. Patients of Black not Hispanic background represented 22.3% of the population, White not Hispanic 66.9% and Hispanic 8.6%. The distribution for other smaller REMs categories was < 5%. When further stratifying by sex we found a greater burden of concurrent CKD and HF in men compared to women across all REMs. The highest prevalence was found in Asian not Hispanic males (58.7%). For comparative purposes we also assessed CKD and HF separately by REMs. The Black not Hispanic population with HF constituted 15.3% and for CKD 20.3%. Hispanics represented for CKD 9.9% and HF 8.3%, while White not Hispanic CKD 67.0% and HF 74.1%. The remaining ethnic and racial groups were < 2% for both. Of import, the Black not Hispanic group represented a greater proportion among those with CKD, HF, or both in comparison to the US Census 2020 (12.1%). In contrast, the Hispanic group consisted of a lower proportion compared to the US Census (18.7%). Conclusions: The investigation of REMs disparities may reflect socioeconomic or genetic influences. Concurrent CKD and HF was consistently higher in men than women across all REMs. Regardless of sex, Black not Hispanics had the highest prevalence. These descriptive data for concurrent CKD and HF illustrate the importance of considering social subgroup characteristics to better understand disease epidemiology.",1.0,Disease,True

Methods: To estimate the incidence and prevalence of different indications by race and ethnicity in the US, data were obtained from several different sources, with US Census data underpinning the population estimates. The county level was selected as the geographic measure to visualize the results. For cancer types, data were obtained from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. For non-oncology diseases, PharMetrics Plus (PM) and the Truven MarketScan Research Multi-State Medicaid Database were used. Incidence and prevalence of non-oncology diseases were estimated at the state level using the PM database, and the racial distribution was estimated from Truven Medicaid. In some cases, racial/ ethnicity breakdowns from the literature were used instead of Medicaid claims data. For all diseases, due to the sparsity of data, the incidence and/or prevalence at the racial/ethnic state level were assumed to be consistent within a state. A visualization tool was then built on top of the data. Results: Fifteen oncology and 5 non-oncology diseases were included in the first iteration of the diversity dashboard. The dashboard allows for the easy filtering and selection by several parameters. The user can select the disease, incidence or prevalence metric, race/ethnicity category, population characteristics such as county population size, and the number of incident or prevalent cases diagnosed annually. Tool tips allow the user to see the number of incident or prevalent cases in a county, as well as the population size of the county. Additional features such as research site advocacy and community-based organization locations can be included as well. Conclusions: Visualization of real-world data with the overlay of race and ethnicity may provide a better understanding of the diversity of patient populations in the US and enable informed decisions and actions for participant awareness, engagement, and recruitment. It is hoped that such efforts will lead to clinical trial populations that are more reflective of the real world and aligned with the epidemiology of the disease studied.",1.0,disease,True

Medicaid coverage requirements analyzed included: counseling required, step therapy, prior authorization, pharmacy/medical benefits, treatment programs covered, preferred drug list (PDL) status for generic/brand-name, dosage/ age limits, as well as rules for pregnancy. Income requirements to qualify for Medicaid were also considered. The results were entered into a dataset and commonalities and differences were identified and analyzed. Results: Prior authorization was required for 39 states while proof of substance use disorder counseling was needed for 46 states. Dosage limits, especially for buprenorphine-based medications, were required for virtually every state, ranging from 8-32mg/day, with many having 2-year limits. Most states that had age limits required patients to be at least 16 years old to start MOUD. PDL status for each state was very different, with an even mix of states preferring generic over brand-name and the reverse. Many states did not have naltrexone on their PDL at all, likely due to its high cost. Buprenorphine was the most commonly approved medication during pregnancy, when mentioned, though many states did not have data on the subject. The income required to enter Medicaid depended on whether states adopted ACA reforms. Conclusions: Significant barriers to access to MOUD involved dosage limits, proof of counseling/prior authorization, as well as PDL status. These barriers could have significant outcomes for Medicaid holders with OUD and thus need to be further studied. Further work would expand analysis to 2016 and 2019 years.",0.0,,False

Methods: Using electronic health records from the OneFlorida+ network, we assembled a cohort of T2D patients who initiated a secondline ADD in 2015-2020. The T2D cohort was spatiotemporally linked to a set of 131 contextual SDoHs documenting their social and built environment at the census tract level.

Results: Of 28 874 study patients, 61% were women, 36% were nonHispanic Black, and the mean age was 58 (± 15) years. Two contextual SDoH factors identified as significantly associated with SGLT2i/GLP1a use were the neighborhood deprivation index and percent of vacant addresses in the neighborhood. Patients living in such neighborhoods are less likely to be prescribed newer ADDs. There was no interrelation between race/ethnicity and SDoH with regard to the use of newer ADDs. Conclusions: Using a data-driven approach, we determined the key contextual-level SDoH factors associated with evidence-based treatment of T2D.

Using a notebook developed in Python, the following steps were automated: 1) exclusion of variables with > 20% missingness; for all other missing data, medians were imputed for numerical and modes for categorical variables, 2) trimming tails at 99.998%, 3) splitting the ADS into training (70%) and test (30%) datasets, and 4) removal of highly correlated variables (VIF > 10). Six PMs were analyzed: Logistic regression classifier, decision tree, random forest, weighted XGBoost (WXGB), weighted CatBoost (WCB), and Support Vector. Ensemble modeling was performed with voting classifier. Results for each model included metrics of F1 scores, accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and Kappa. The best model fit was determined by high sensitivity and AUC. Results: The ADS included 683 695 TKA patients with 108 preoperative variables. All models except for the SVM could be generated. Outcome data was highly imbalanced (ie, low 90-day rate): 2% of patients had an RKC, and 13% of patients had an RCC. For RKC, WCB had the highest sensitivity (0.557) and AUC (0.625) while all models had weaker scores. The ensemble modeling had lower sensitivity and AUC than WCB. For RCC, WCB also outperformed all other models with an AUC of 0.837 and a sensitivity of 0.776. The comparatively high AUC predictability of RCC vs RKC was possibly due to the lower rate of RKC vs RCC. In addition, cardiac readmissions are more likely predicted by variables in the ADS (eg, preoperative comorbidities) vs knee readmissions, which might be associated with surgical characteristics not captured in a claims database.

Methods: Retrospective analysis of hospital data from the Premier Healthcare Database. Study patients were age 18 years and had a hospital encounter for one of 9 procedures of interest between 1-Jan-2019 and 31-Dec-2019: cholecystectomy, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), cystectomy, hepatectomy, hysterectomy, pancreatectomy, peripheral vascular, thoracic, and valve procedures (first procedure ,"" index). Patients were also required to have evidence of hemostatic agent use during index. Patients were grouped by presence vs. absence of uncontrolled bleeding, defined as diagnosis and/or intervention for bleeding during the index encounter despite hemostat use. Outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) admission and duration, requirement for ventilator, overall length of stay (LOS), and total hospital costs during index.

While many patients have anatomy suitable for a variety of EVAR endografts, there have been concerns around endoleaks for patient receiving some endograft devices. There is little evidence on outcomes associated with graft choice to guide treatment decisions. Objectives: To compare rates of mortality, rupture and secondary intervention following EVAR using contemporary endograft devices from three major manufacturers. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study using linked clinical registry (Australasian Vascular Audit) and administrative data. We identified patients undergoing EVAR for intact AAA between 2010-2019 in New South Wales, Australia. We compared all-cause mortality, secondary rupture and secondary intervention rates for patients treated with Medtronic (Endurant), Gore (Excluder) and Cook Medical (Zenith) standard devices. We used inverse probability of treatment weighted proportional hazards and competing risk regression to adjust for patient, clinical and aneurysm characteristics. Results: We identified 2874 eligible EVAR patients, with a median follow-up of 4.1 (maximum 9.5) years. Mortality rates were similar for patients receiving different devices (ranging between 7.0-7.3 per 100 person-years). There was no significant difference between devices in secondary rupture rates, which ranged between 0.4-0.5 per 100 person-years. Patients receiving Medtronic or Gore devices tended to have higher rates of subsequent aneurysm repair (1.5 per 100 person-years) than patients receiving Cook devices (0.8 per 100 person-years), but not all these differences reached statistical significance (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.02-2.47; HR 1.73, 95% CI 0.94-3.18 respectively).

Variability in methodology of DY calculation and cancer prevalence impact the reported outcomes. Objectives: To quantify the impact of this variability on DY estimates under a variety of clinical scenarios. Methods: We conducted a simulation analysis. We generated a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients undergoing bronchoscopy for parenchymal lung lesion biopsy. Based on published literature, we used the following base case assumptions: cancer prevalence at index (60%), distribution of non-malignant cases at index [Specific Benign (SPB) , 10%; Non-specific Benign (NSB) , 35%; Nondiagnostic (ND) ,"" 55%], and loss to follow up at 12 months (10%). The sensitivity of bronchoscopy for malignancy was assumed to be 80%. We calculated DY, defined as the rate of True Positives (TPs) and True Negatives (TNs), using three alternative methods. Method 1 considered malignancy as TP and only SPB results as TN. Method 2 was an extension of Method 1 and allowed NSB cases to be counted as TNs if follow-up confirmed benign disease. Method 3 allows for all cases with a non-malignant result to be counted as a TN if follow-up data confirmed benign disease. A scenario analysis was conducted to demonstrate the impact of a wide range of parameter estimates on DY. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was conducted to simulate the DY obtained from the 3 methods using 10 000 simulated clinical scenarios in which all parameters were allowed to vary around the base case using a normal distribution. Results: The DY estimates based on base case assumptions were 53.2% (method 1), 64.5% (method 2), and 89.2% (method 3). Scenario analysis revealed cancer prevalence has the largest impact on DY, especially when using method 1 and 2. When cancer prevalence exceeds 80%, these commonly used definitions merge with regards to DY. In PSA, DY ranged from 22.9%-87.6% using method 1, 38.8%88.7% using method 2, and 67.3%-100% using method 3. PSA also revealed that in all simulated clinical scenarios, method 1 always resulted in lower DY estimates than method 2, which was always lower than method 3.

Methods: EURAS-LCS12 is an ongoing prospective, noninterventional cohort study in ten European countries. Women with a newly inserted hormonal or copper IUD were enrolled between 2014-2021.

Only a few studies have examined the impact of one-dose vaccination against varicella zoster virus on the incidence of varicella cases with complications among children using standard disease classification codes at a national level. Objectives: To determine whether the incidence of varicella cases with complications had decreased during 2010-2020 among Korean children after the introduction of the universal one-dose varicella vaccination program in 2005. Methods: For this study, open access nationwide healthcare claim data from the Korea Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA), publicly available through the healthcare big data open system (http://opendata.hira.or.kr), were used. In the data, varicella cases with complication were recorded according to the International Classification of Disease, 10th revision (ICD-10). Annual incidence rates of varicella cases with complications were estimated by dividing the numbers of age-specific (0-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-19 years) varicella cases with complications in the HIRA data by the age-specific total population sizes in each year from 2010 to 2020. In addition, complication-specific analysis was performed: meningitis (B010), encephalitis, myelitis and encephalomyelitis (B011), pneumonia (B012), and other complications (B018). Results: The incidence of varicella cases with complications among Korean children has significantly (92%) decreased from 137 per 100 000 persons in 2010 to 11 per 100 000 persons in 2020.

5052,"Background: Children and adolescents are disadvantaged in terms of drug treatment. 42%-90% of hospitalized pediatric patients are treated with medications outside their product license (off-label use); in the outpatient setting, 46%-64% of patients are affected. Since the beginning of the 2first century, authorities have made various regulatory efforts to facilitate pediatric drug development and thus reduce off-label use. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to analyze the licensing status of drug prescriptions in German pediatric (specialized) outpatient clinics and to determine changes over a 10-year period. Methods: In 2009 and 2019, retrospective, monocentric, crosssectional studies were conducted to assess drug prescriptions with regard to their licensing status in 10 (one general and nine specialized) outpatient clinics in Germany. All patients less than 18 years of age who had received at least one electronic drug prescription were included. Prescriptions were systematically classified as in-label, offlabel or unlicensed and characteristics for off-label prescribing (e.g. indication, dose, etc.) were assigned according to the currently valid SmPC. The prevalence and relative frequency of off-label prescriptions were calculated, reasons for off-label prescribing were analyzed and logistic regression was performed to determine influencing factors. Results: 751 prescriptions of 296 patients in 2009 and 1438 prescriptions of 786 patients in 2019 were examined and classified according to their licensing status. The relative frequency of off-label prescribing was around 45% with no significant change over the decade. The prevalence of off-label prescriptions was 60.1% in 2009 and 53.1% in 2019, and therefore significantly higher in 2009 (p ,"" 0.037). The mean number of prescriptions per patient was also significantly higher in 2009 (2.5 ± 2.3 vs. 1.8 ± 1.5, p<0.000). There was a strong correlation between prevalence and the number of prescriptions per patient. In both years, drugs for obstructive airway diseases and vitamins were among the three most frequently off-label prescribed therapeutic drug groups. Moreover, the comparison revealed the same high-ranking reasons for off-label use in the two studies: indication, overdosing and missing pediatric information. Conclusions: Off-label prescribing continues to play an important role in everyday clinical practice in pediatrics. Despite numerous regulatory efforts and incentives, no substantial decrease in off-label prescribing has been observed since 2009. Further efforts are therefore needed to generate more evidence-based knowledge about pediatric pharmacotherapy and to treat children in the best possible way.""",1.0,flu,True

5062,"Background: Comparing antibiotic prescribing between countries can provide important insights into potential needs of improving antibiotic stewardship programs. Given the high prevalence of antibiotic use in early life, a focus on this age group is of particular interest. Objectives: To compare outpatient antibiotic prescribing in early life between children born in Denmark (DK) vs. Germany (GER). Methods: Using the Danish nationwide healthcare registries and the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD; claims data covering ~20% of the German population), we included children born between 2004 and 2016 and followed them from birth until end of enrollment or Dec 31, 2018, identifying outpatient antibiotic prescriptions. For each country, we determined the median time to first antibiotic prescription using Kaplan- Meier analyzes. For the first two years of life, we calculated the prescription rate (number of prescriptions per 1000 persons/year) and determined quality indicators of antibiotic prescribing (ratio of broad- to narrow-spectrum antibiotics [B/N ratio]; and access-to-watch index according to the WHO) based on the first prescription. All analyzes were stratified by year of birth. Results: Overall, the cohorts comprised ~0.8 (DK) and ~1.6 million (GER) children. In the 2016 birth cohort, the median time until first outpatient antibiotic prescription was ~21 (DK) and ~28 months (GER) and had increased by 50% (DK) and 59% (GER) compared to the 2004 birth cohort. The prescription rate was 617 (DK) and 477 (GER) in the 2016 birth cohort and had decreased by 45% (in both countries) compared to the 2004 birth cohort. In the 2016 birth cohort, the B/N ratio was 0.15 (DK) and 3.93 (GER); and the access-to-watch index was 19.5 (DK) and 1.1 (GER). The B/N ratio was consistently low for Denmark, while it almost doubled for Germany over time. Conclusions: Over the first two years of life, children born in Denmark received antibiotics markedly earlier and more frequently than in Germany, while quality indicators of antibiotic prescribing were more favorable in Denmark.

Assessing the impact on pediatric psychotropic medication use and potential regional variations would provide insight into the magnitude of effect in this population. Objectives: To examine trends in, and geographic variability of, psychotropic prescriptions to US children before and in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We utilized IQVIA's US Longitudinal Prescription dataset from Jan 2019 to Sept 2020, which captures approximately 90% of prescriptions dispensed across the US. Data was provided under the IQVIA Institute Human Data Science Research Collaborative. We examined prescriptions dispensed to children aged 5-17 years by therapeutic class: antidepressants, antipsychotics, attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications (stimulants, alpha agonists), and sedatives/anxiolytics. We measured total prescriptions dispensed per month overall and stratified by ten US geographical regions (as defined by US CDC). We estimated the year-over-year percent change in number of prescriptions dispensed in 2020 vs. 2019 overall and by month for Mar through Sept. Results: In the study period, 95.6 million pediatric psychotropic prescriptions were dispensed in the US. More antidepressant, antipsychotic, and sedative/anxiolytic prescriptions were dispensed to children in Mar 2020 compared to Mar 2019 (% increase by medication class: 412%), followed by a sharp decline in May 2020 compared to May 2019 (% decline: 7%-13%). By Sept 2020, counts were similar to Sept 2019. ADHD medications were similar in Mar of 2020 vs. 2019 but by May 2020 dropped 21% (2.3 million dispensings in May 2020 vs. 2.9 million in May 2019); by Sept 2020, prescriptions remained below 2019 levels. Trends observed in pediatric psychotropic prescriptions in 2020 vs. 2019 were similar by US region however, regional variation was observed in the magnitude of change and extent of rebound of prescription counts by Sept 2020. In New England and Pacific regions, fewer antipsychotics (5%, À8%, respectively) and antidepressants (À4%, À3%) were dispensed from Mar-Sept 2020 vs. Mar-Sept 2019, while in the West North Central region, more antipsychotics (+3%) and antidepressants (+4%) were dispensed. Conclusions: Overall, there were fewer psychotropic prescriptions dispensed for US children early in the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. While some regions rebounded to prepandemic numbers by Sept. 2020, this varied by psychotropic class and region.

5072,"Background: Antibiotic exposure has been linked to incident juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) through a purported mechanism of microbiome disruption. Among non-sedating H1 antagonists, loratadine, but not cetirizine, has direct antibacterial properties and may disrupt microbiota. Objectives: To test if loratadine exposure is associated with newly diagnosed JIA. Methods: We performed a nested case-control study using data from 45-state US Medicaid claims data (2001-2012). Cases were newly diagnosed with JIA based on previously validated diagnostic algorithms. Each case was matched to up to 10 randomly selected unaffected controls by age, sex, state, and years of enrollment at the time of JIA diagnosis (index date). Subjects were excluded for non-JIA rheumatic diseases, immunodeficiencies, malignancy, prior immunosuppression, and exposure to multiple antihistamines. Loratadine and cetirizine exposure was defined by a prescription dispensed prior to a 3-month pre-index lag period and categorized by number of courses dispensed and time relative to the index date. The association between antihistamine exposure and incident JIA diagnosis was estimated using conditional logistic regression, adjusting for race, eligibility type, allergic and other comorbid conditions, antibiotics, and prior infections, and expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To approximate an active-comparator study, exposed groups were compared indirectly based on the difference of respective coefficients. Results: We included 13 012 cases with JIA and 128 996 controls. 16 728 subjects were exposed only to loratadine, 10 369 only to cetirizine, and 105 851 were unexposed to antihistamines. Compared to no antihistamine exposure, we found weak associations for loratadine exposure (OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.11, 1.25]) and cetirizine exposure (OR 1.13 [95% CI 1.05, 1.22]). However, loratadine was not associated with JIA when compared to cetirizine (OR 1.04 [95% CI 0.95, 1.13]). Further, we found a weak association for a single course of loratadine within the past year (OR 1.15 [95% CI 1.01, 1.32]) but not 2+ courses (OR 0.96 [95% CI 0.80, 1.15]).

Although no therapies have been approved specifically to prevent or treat cCMV, six months of (v)GCV initiated within the first month of life is recommended for newborns with moderate to severe disease to improve outcomes. Objectives: To describe (v)GCV use for treatment of cCMV in the United States. Methods: We used the FDA Sentinel System's Distributed Database (1/2008-3/2021) to identify infants with cCMV, defined as any diagnosis code for cCMV or CMV in the first 45 days of life (G1). The date of earliest observed diagnosis code during the study period served as the index date. Additionally, we identified two subsets: cCMV treated with (v)GCV within 45 days of the index diagnosis (G2), and cCMV treated with (v)GCV within 180 days of the index diagnosis (G3). We assessed hearing loss and common cCMV-related clinical characteristics at baseline, and periodically assessed hearing loss and hematological outcomes, associated with both cCMV and (v)GCV, in the 365 days following the cCMV diagnosis. Results: We identified 1500 infants with cCMV (G1), of which 15% were treated with (v)GCV within 45 days (G2) and 20% within 180 days (G3). Among all G1-G3 infants, mean age at diagnosis was 8-9 days (SD 11.5-12.3 days) and 53%-54% were male. Among G1 infants, 70% had at least one cCMV-related clinical characteristic with or without hearing loss at baseline, of whom 23% received (v)GCV.

5101,"Background: Depression in pregnancy is common, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are usually the first line of medications for treating perinatal depression. However, their effects on fetal development are less clearly understood. In recent years, animal and clinical studies suggest that potential risks to the offspring may not manifest until adolescence, once brain circuits regulating emotion have matured. However few studies have examined outcomes into adolescence. Here, we use Danish population data to test the effect of maternal SSRI use during pregnancy on offspring emotional psychopathology up to age 22. Objectives: To test the associations between maternal SSRI antidepressant use in pregnancy and offspring emotional disorders and antidepressant usage while controlling for confounders. Methods: SETTING: 1 094 202 single-birth Danish children born 1997-2015, and followed through 2018, using data linkages across Danish national birth, prescription, and patient registers. MAIN EXPOSURE: use of any SSRI medication within the pregnancy period. Main Outcome: first diagnosis/filled drug; each diagnostic and medication class were also examined individually. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Propensity score weights (primary) and matching were used to adjust for potential confounders. We also used Danish National Birth Cohort data (1997-2003) to quantify subclinical differences. Results: 4.6% (n , 1018) of exposed and 3.9% (n , 42 796) of unexposed offspring had an emotional disorder diagnosis or an antidepressant prescription (propensity-score-weighted HR , 1.45 [95% CI:",1.0,clinical,True

The associations were similar when restricting the sample to pregnant mothers with a psychiatric diagnosis (HR , 1.46 [1.24-1.72]). PS-weighting reduced mean differences between SSRI users and non-users on most but not all clinical and subclinical factors. Paternal use during the index pregnancy was also associated with offspring emotional disorders (HR ,"" 1.33 [1.22, 1.46]). Conclusions: Our findings extend previous work suggesting that prenatal antidepressant exposure is associated with increased, as well as earlier onset of, emotional disorders throughout adolescence. Offspring of mothers who use SSRIs in pregnancy constitute a high-risk cohort who should be screened for psychiatric onset prior to adolescence. The associations between paternal SSRI use and offspring outcomes suggest that effects of in utero exposure may be a combination of drug-specific exposures and markers of underlying maternal illness.""",1.0,clinical,True

Results: Among 422 156 mother-child pairs, 2125 children were born from mothers exposed to levothyroxine during pregnancy. A significantly increased risk of preterm birth was observed in children with maternal levothyroxine exposure during pregnancy, when compared to mothers who had no history of thyroid-related diagnoses or prescriptions (weighted OR [wOR]: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.39). Similarly, an increased risk of preterm birth was found among children of gestational levothyroxine users, when compared to children of mothers who had used levothyroxine before but stopped during pregnancy (wOR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.09, 4.25). Sensitivity analysis by excluding mothers exposed to psychotropic or antiepileptics medications before or during pregnancy also indicated a similar increased risk of preterm birth regarding the gestational use of levothyroxine (wOR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.45). No significant association was observed for the risk of SGA, ADHD, and ASD.

5112,"Background: Accurate estimates of gestational age (GA) and pregnancy outcome from administrative and clinical databases are critical to the validity of pregnancy exposure and outcome studies. Moll et. al.

The authors found strong agreement between the algorithms and physician adjudication of EMRs. Objectives: To assess the consistency of the GA algorithms described by Moll across multiple real-world databases. Methods: Using 4 administrative and electronic health record (EHR) databases (Optum Claims, Optum EHR, Pharmetrics Plus®, and MarketScan® Databases), the GA algorithm was applied to female subjects ages 12-55 years (inclusive), with a pregnancy outcome code of interest between 02/01/2017-06/30/2021, and continuous enrollment for at least 10 months prior and 30 days following the end of pregnancy.

5113,"Results: There were 2 187 148 eligible pregnancies across the 4 databases. Application of the GA algorithm yielded 1 672 334 (76%) FTBs, 269 744 (12%) PTBs, 232 888 (11%) SAs, and 12 182 (< 1%) stillbirths; GA could not be estimated for 68 065 (3%) pregnancies. The GA algorithm performed consistently across databases. GA estimation was most frequently based on a Z3A code (ICD-10 code for weeks of gestational age) with another type of service (5269%), a Z3A code with a first trimester ultrasound (16%-25%), and a Z3A code with an anatomic ultrasound (10%-13%). The distribution of median GA at the end of pregnancy was similar across the datasets: 39 weeks for FTB; 36 for PTB; 23-26 weeks for stillbirths; and 10 weeks for SA. Conclusions: The GA algorithm performed consistently across 4 databases, according to the step in the hierarchy each GA was estimated, and the age distribution for each outcome type. These results suggest the algorithm can be used in multiple real-world databases to estimate GA and may be a valuable tool for assessing pregnancy exposures and outcomes.",0.0,,False

Objectives: We aimed to assess the risk of hospitalization for VOE associated with out-hospital exposure to systemic corticosteroids in patients with SCD in France. Methods: Data source was the French national health database. The study population consisted in all patients with SCD with at least one hospitalization for VOE between 2010 and 2018, identified with a primary discharge diagnosis of VOE (D57.0 code of the international classification of disease, 10th version; positive predictive value: 98.6%). All SCD genotypes were included. Patients hospitalized during the three months before the first VOE were excluded. We performed a casecase-time-control study, which allows a self-adjustment for timeindependent confounders. The outcome was the first hospitalization for VOE. The exposure to oral and injectable corticosteroids, identified using out-hospital reimbursement data, was assessed during a case period (28 days before the outcome) compared to the exposure during a control period (28 days, starting 84 days before the outcome). The same comparison was made among future cases (matched patients hospitalized for VOE the year after the given case), in order to adjust for the trend of exposure to corticosteroids (calendar variations).

5138,"Background: Friedreich Ataxia (FA) is a rare mitochondrial disorder characterized by progressive loss of muscle control resulting in impaired movement and speech. When the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes switched to the 10th revision (in Oct 2015), the FA-specific diagnosis code was removed and not reinstated until September 30, 2020. This period of non-specific coding complicates the design and implementation of retrospective claims analyzes characterizing patients with FA. Objectives: To explore ICD-10 codes captured during the non-specific period among patients who had specific FA diagnosis prior to the ICD-10 revision in October 2015. Methods: This study used the United States IBM MarketScan Commercial database subset from Aug 2010 to Sept 2020. Patients with 1 inpatient, or 2 outpatient visits separated by 30 days, with a primary or secondary diagnosis of FA (ICD-9 334.0) prior to Oct 2015 were identified. The most frequently recorded primary ICD-10 diagnosis codes during the nonspecific period were summarized, overall and among the subset of visits coded by a neurologist. Results: A total of 669 patients with FA were identified from the period of Aug 1, 2010, to Sept 30, 2015. Among those with available follow-up during the non-specific period, the code for a group of conditions classified as early-onset cerebellar ataxia (ICD-10 G11.1) was the most frequently captured diagnosis code for inpatient and outpatient visits overall, and when coded by a neurologist. For outpatient neurologist diagnoses, G11.1 accounted for 46% of encounters, followed by codes G11.8 (other hereditary ataxias, 4%), and G11.3 (cerebellar ataxia with defective DNA repair, 4%). The top three inpatient neurologist codes were G11.1 (34%), M41.45 (neuromuscular scoliosis, 18%), and I49.01 (ventricular fibrillation, 14%). Conclusions: This study confirms that identifying FA patients from administrative claims databases is challenging during the non-specific coding period. G11.1 was the most frequently used for primary diagnoses among patients with FA, however this code is also used for various other ataxias.

5144,"Background: Clinical trials of gene therapies are often unrandomized due to limited sample size, lack of effective treatment and ethical considerations for placebo treatment in often debilitating diseases. External control arms (ECAs) can be used to provide context on disease progression. Critical to applying an ECA strategy is comparability of the population, outcomes, procedures and assessment timepoints between the trial and ECA data source, but in most situations, analyzes of the trial and ECA cannot be blinded. Objectives: To review development and pre-testing of methods to minimize rater bias and generate blinded data for single-arm trials, despite the lack of an internal comparator. Methods: We developed an innovative process to demonstrate effectiveness of a gene therapy in a trial conducted in children with significant development delays and mortality with disease progression. The primary endpoint is assessed by clinicians in the trial and will be assessed similarly in a natural history study (NHS); the assessment could not be blinded. However, interviews with experts and caregivers/parents (CG/P) as well as review of existing measures identified observable activities that were meaningful in child development as well as to CG/Ps and could be video recorded. Following development of standardized materials to instruct CG/Ps to record their child attempting specific activities (e.g., communication, eye movement, head control, limb movement, walking, block play), a centralized 3-expert panel reviewed videos from a pre-test of materials and video recording procedures prior to implementation in the two studies. Results: CG/Ps showed good understanding of pre-test of materials and procedures, having minor suggestions. Testing the expert review process with pre-test videos showed mostly good agreement among the three experts (agreement: 80% to 100%) for gross motor skills and lower agreement for more subtle aspects and reactive communications. For the clinical trial and NHS, the panel will review videos in random order, blinded to timepoint, treatment (i.e., study) and dose cohort, with quality control videos randomly intermixed to monitor longitudinal drift within raters. Conclusions: This novel approach reflects an innovative way to minimize rater bias and generate blinded, more rigorous data in single-arm trials to show improvement and progression in treated patients in a gene therapy trial and untreated NHS patients.",1.0,Clinical,True

5148,"Background: Amid rising incidence of gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer, identification of cases in real world datasets has proved difficult. While the GEJ has differing pathological features from the esophagus and stomach, there are no International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for cancer at the GEJ. Objectives: To develop a method for use of electronic health record (EHR) provider notes to identify patients with, and diagnostic patterns in, GEJ cancer. Methods: This study used Optum Pan-Oncology® EHR data (United States). The study cohort included adult patients with an ICD code for cancer of the stomach or esophagus between March 31 2015-2020. GEJ cases were identified using two definitions in Natural Language Processed (NLP) provider notes: (1) Primary GEJ Cohort: presence of a ""Term"" related to cancer and ""Location"" related to the GEJ, and (2) Subgroup: patients in the primary GEJ cohort with additional presence of a confirmatory note called a ""Sentiment."" Those identified were then assessed for subsequent ICD and provider note diagnoses in their patient timelines. Results: Out of 41 370 patients with an ICD code for esophageal or gastric cancer, 567 (1.4%) had a provider note for GEJ cancer in the 30 days prior to the ICD diagnosis. 2526 (6.1%) had a provider note for GEJ cancer on or in the 30 days following the ICD diagnosis. After applying exclusion criteria, 1869 of these 2526 patients met the primary GEJ cohort definition. 76.4% and 56.7% of these patients had a subsequent diagnosis for esophageal or gastric cancer respectively. 69.6% and 37.5% of these patients had subsequent provider notes that additionally met the ""Term/Location"" and ""Term/Location/Sentiment"" GEJ cancer definitions, respectively. 72% of provider note events in the dataset were not associated with a ""Sentiment."" Of patients in the primary cohort, 649 (34.7%) met the subgroup definition. 80.7% and 62.4% had a subsequent diagnosis for esophageal or gastric cancer respectively. 72.1% and 55.8% of this subgroup had subsequent provider notes that additionally met the ""Term/Location"" and ""Term/Location/Sentiment"" definitions, respectively. Conclusions: Compared to the broader ""Term/Location"" definition, the more restricted ""Term/Location/Sentiment"" definition captured a higher proportion of patients who had additional GEJ provider notes following their first, but identified fewer patients overall. In the absence of a gold standard, these explorations and sample size considerations were important in understanding real world clinical patterns and creating a meaningful and novel algorithm for identifying GEJ cancer in EHR records.",1.0,case,True

5155,"Background: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism; clinical presentation can vary widely. Natural history studies to date are limited and are primarily from single tertiary care institutions; no recent study has been conducted in the US. Objectives: To describe the prevalence, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and disease progression of WD patients in the US coupled with validation of WD definition. Methods: This retrospective study used the US Optum® EHR database from 1/1/2007 to 09/30/2020. The study population included patients who had at least 1 ICD diagnostic code for WD (ICD- 10,E83.01 or ICD-9 code ,"" 275.1), and at least 1 of the following: 1 inpatient visit or 2 outpatient visits with WD diagnoses 30 days apart, a reported treatment for WD, or an ICD/CPT code for cirrhosis or liver transplantation. The first occurrence of the WD diagnostic code in the study period represents the index date. This WD definition was validated through clinician review of a subset of the sample with available clinical notes, and the positive predictive value (PPV) was calculated. WD patients' demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment, and progression to hepatic, neurologic, and psychiatric manifestations, and death were described and calculated. Results: A total of 4665 WD patients were identified, with a prevalence rate of 6.6 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI: 6.4 to 6.9). Among the WD case population 56% were female, 78% Caucasian, and 81% nonHispanic. The median age was 50 years (IQR: 34 to 63), and median follow-up was 3.8 years (IQR: 1.7 to 6.1). During follow-up, 17% (n "","" 804) of patients with WD died and the median time from index date to death was 2.1 years (IQR: 0.9 to 4.1). During follow-up, hepatic manifestations were reported in 50% of WD patients (liver cirrhosis 23%, liver failure 14%, liver transplant 7%), neurologic symptoms in 41% (gait disturbance 24%, dysphasia 24%), and psychiatric manifestations in 55% (depression 41%, psychosis 10%). Approximately 18% of WD patients were recorded to have been on treatment for WD at some point during follow-up, with 8% on chelators and 13% on zinc. After clinical review and case definition validation of 210 patients, 130 were confirmed with WD (PPV "","" 62%), resulting in an adjusted prevalence rate of 4.1 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI: 4.0 to 4.3). Conclusions: No evidence of treatment for WD was reported for the vast majority of WD patients even though average follow-up was nearly 4 years, while hepatic and psychiatric manifestations occurred in an overall majority of WD patients. Future natural history studies of WD are needed to further validate these results.""",1.0,disease,True

Although vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing severe forms of COVID-19, a residual risk may persist, despite vaccination, for certain population groups. Objectives: To determine medical and socioeconomic risk factors associated with risks of COVID-19-related hospitalization and inhospital mortality in France by August, 31 2021 among fully vaccinated persons. Methods: The study was based on data from the national COVID-19 vaccination database (VAC-SI) coupled with the National Health Data System (SNDS), which contains comprehensive reimbursement and hospitalization data for all of France. All people fully vaccinated by July 31, 2021, with a double-injection vaccine, i.e., the mRNA BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines, or a single dose for people with a previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included and followed until August 31, 2021. Cox proportional hazard models were performed to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for COVID-19-related hospitalization or in-hospital death associated with age, gender, deprivation index, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive or oral corticosteroid therapy from day 14 after fullvaccination. Results: In a population of 28 031 641 fully vaccinated individuals with an average follow-up of 80 days, 5345 (87 hospitalizations per 100 000 person-years) were hospitalized for COVID-19 and 996 (16 in-hospital death per 100 000 person-years) died in hospital. In multivariable analysis, a higher risk was observed with increasing age, male gender, and social deprivation. Most of the 47 chronic conditions considered were positively associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization and a slight excess risk of death. The risk of hospitalization and in-hospital death for COVID-19 also increased with the use of immunosuppressants (aHR 3.3 [2.8-3.8] and 2.4 [1.7-3.5], respectively) and oral corticosteroids (aHR 2.8 [2.5-3.1] and 4.1 [3.3-5.1]). Less than 10% of hospitalized cases and 2% of those who died in hospital had no identified comorbidities. There was a strong association between an increasing number of comorbidities and the risk of hospitalization and in-hospital death (e.g., 5+ versus none, aHR 10.1 95% CI 9.0-11.5 and 17.8 95% CI 11.5-27.4, respectively). Conclusions: Although vaccination has dramatically reduced the occurrence of severe forms of COVID-19, a residual risk remains for the elderly, immunocompromised, and polypathological populations and warrants complementary preventive measures.",1.0,vaccine,True

5165,"Background: The European electronic healthcare data source landscape is growing. In Europe, healthcare systems and healthcare practices vary broadly across countries, which impacts the capture of medical records in electronic databases. It is of importance to consider heterogeneity in data capture for multi-databases assessment. Objectives: To assess the impact of heterogenous diagnosis vocabularies and different provenance of data on the incidence rate of AESI across 10 European electronic healthcare databases. Methods: A multi-database dynamic cohort study was conducted from 2017 to 2020 (2010 and 2014 for 2 databases) to generate background incidence rates (IR) of 41 AESI. We used 10 data sources from 7 European countries (DK, FR, GE, IT, ES, NL, UK) capturing data from different provenance: inpatient and/or outpatient settings, emergency room visits or general practitioner medical records (GP) and varying vocabularies (ICD9/ICD10, ICPC, SNOMED). Some data sources contained multi-data provenance for event diagnosis including simultaneously hospital-records linkage (in-outpatient) and GP data. To standardize the process for IR generation, syntactic harmonization was conducted by the Data Access Providers (conversion to ConcePTION CDM), semantic harmonization was part of the analytic R program. IR for each data source were computed by age and sex by dividing the number of incident cases by the total person-time at risk. Age-standardized rates (against Eurostat population) were pooled using random effect models according to the provenance of the events diagnosis: (1) Inpatient only, (2) In and outpatient, (3) Inpatient and emergency room, (4) GP and in-outpatient, (5) GP only. Results: A total follow-up time of 211.7 million person-years from 63 million individuals was included. For most of the 41 AESI, rates varied according to the provenance of the event diagnosis.

AESI such as anosmiaageusia were better captured in setting including GP data. Conclusions: This study highlighted the appropriateness of electronic healthcare data sources for a correct identification of AESI and consequently, correct interpretation of IRs. Our results showed the importance of the nature of the event and the setting in, which it is diagnosed which should be captured by the data sources that are used to calculate rates, otherwise underestimation is likely.",0.0,,False

5193,"Background: On January 29, 2021, Pfizer, in collaboration with the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Analysis Group, initiated a study (C4591012) for EUA active surveillance among VHA enrollees. Objectives: To assess whether the VHA population experiences increased risk of safety events of interest after receiving PfizerBioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: Electronic medical record (EMR) data from the US VHA were used to conduct rapid-cycle, longitudinal, cohort study analyzes. The study period began on 12/11/2020 (US FDA EUA approval date) and the data cutoff date for this abstract was 9/24/2021. Different methods of analyzes for signal detection and evaluation were conducted for 46 pre-specified safety events of interest in addition to a prioritized analysis of myocarditis/ pericarditis. Results: A total of 1 448 043 VHA enrollees with a mean age of 65.2 years received  1 dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Using seasonal influenza vaccine as an active comparator, cerebrovascular non-hemorrhagic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, chilblain-like lesions, anaphylaxis, and acute kidney injury were initially detected as potential signals. None remained as a signal following evaluation based on multivariate Poisson regression with a pre-specified signal definition of incidence rate ratio (IRR)>3 and p-value < 0.01. For myocarditis/pericarditis, there were 29 cases within the 21-day risk interval after either dose of the PfizerBioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and the rate was not significantly different during the comparison interval for both doses (adjusted IRR [95% CI]: 1.07 [0.56, 2.04]). Of the 29 cases, 19 were confirmed through chart review. All 19 individuals had pericarditis and 4/19 (21.1%) had myocarditis. All 4 cases of myocarditis and 17/19 (89.5%) cases of pericarditis had recovered by the date of chart review. Conclusions: None of the safety events of interest were found to be associated with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine based on the signal detection and signal evaluation analyzes. Active safety surveillance is an essential part of pandemic response. For myocarditis/pericarditis, adjusted analyzes comparing events in the risk interval vs. comparison interval among Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine recipients detected no signals, although the small sample size of young men in the VHA population provided limited statistical power.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Objectives: To investigate the real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE) of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines among elderly US NH long-term stay residents in the pre-Delta and Delta variant periods. Methods: Retrospective cohort study using Medicare claims data among beneficiaries ages 65 years residing in US NHs December 2020-November 2021. The study allowed for time-varying exposures: residents contributed time to unvaccinated, one, two (fully vaccinated), and three/booster-dose vaccinated cohorts. Primary outcomes were severe COVID-related outcomes (hospitalizations and deaths). Marginal Structural Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios for outcomes in the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts. Confounding was adjusted for by using propensity score weighting and by including time-varying factors in the outcome model (census-tract level COVID-19 circulation, proportion Delta). Results: The source population consisted of >1 015 000 Medicare beneficiaries residing in >15 000 NHs as of December 2020. After applying inclusion criteria, the eligible population included >336 000 elderly NH long-term stay Medicare beneficiaries. Over 50% of NH residents received >1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine between December 27, 2020-January 16, 2021, and >70% received >1 dose by January 31, 2021. We conducted a preliminary analysis using data accrued prior to August 14, 2021. The unvaccinated and fully vaccinated cohorts were well-balanced after propensity score weighting except for level of COVID-19 circulation, prior influenza vaccination, and prior COVID-19 diagnosis. The crude rate of post-weighting COVID-19 hospitalization per 100 000 person-weeks was 145.32 and 18.82 among the unvaccinated and fully vaccinated, respectively; and 139.41 and 39.95, respectively, for the death outcome. During the high COVID-19 circulation (5000 COVID-19 cases over 4 weeks per 100 000 persons), pre-Delta period VE was 74% (95% CI 70%-78%) against COVID-related death and 72% (95% CI 66%-77%) against COVID-related hospitalization, 99% Delta period VE was 64% (95% CI 54%-72%) against death and 43% (95% CI 24%-58%) against hospitalization. Conclusions: COVID-19 mRNA vaccines were effective against severe COVID-related outcomes among elderly NH residents.

5202,"Background: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic diseases with increased morbidity and reduced quality of life. Development of newly coding algorithms for IBD identification using claims databases is needed. Objectives: to develop and test specific coding algorithms to identify Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in a cohort of users of biologics approved for IBDs, using claims database of an Italian Local Health Unit (LHU). Methods: Fully anonymized data were extracted from the claims database of Caserta LHU during the years 2015-2018. As gold standard, we considered confirmed diagnoses of CD and UC, as reported by specialists in electronic therapeutic plans (ETPs). Five CD/UC specific algorithms were developed. IBDs-related ICD9-CM codes as primary cause of hospital admissions, exemption from healthcare service copayment codes and dispensing of biologic/non-biologic drugs only approved for CD/UC were the components of the newly developed IBD coding algorithms. Sensitivity (Se)/specificity (Sp)/positive (PPV)/ negative predicted values (NPV) were estimated. Performance of each algorithm was evaluated through the Youden index. Such algorithms were developed to distinguish patients with CD/UC from non-IBD cases in the cohort of users of biologics approved for CD/UC treatment. Results: Among 1 million inhabitants from Caserta LHU, 627 subjects received at least a biologic drug for which ETP was available. Of these, 134 (21%) biologic users had 1 ETP with IBD diagnosis; specifically, 83 (62%) and 51 (38%) patients were identified as confirmed diagnosis of CD and UC, separately. The best algorithm for CD identification (Youden Index (0.953)) included diagnosis code (i.e. ICD-9:555.x) OR specific exemption code (009.555/555) OR [non-specific exemption code (009) AND dispensing of non-biologic drugs with exclusive CD indication (methotrexate/budesonide)] (SE: 98.8%; Sp: 96.5%; PPV: 81.2%).

These biological medicines are prescribed in specialized consultations that can be taken at both public (Serviço Nacional de Saúde) and private sector. However, they can only be dispensed at public sector facilities. The data related to every act of dispensing these medicines must be sent by NHS's hospitals to INFARMED, the national medicine agency. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to analyze the characteristics of patients who were dispensed biological medicines and prescribing patterns in Portugal in 2020. Methods: Observational, descriptive and retrospective study based on the data shared by all pharmaceutical services of public hospitals and 3 hospitals with public-private partnerships. Results: The data of the present study refers to a sample of 10 930 patients aged between 2 and 94 years old, of which about 54.7% are female patients and 45.3% are male patients. The age range (years) with the highest prevalence corresponds to [50, 60[ (24.1%) and the lowest prevalence to [0, 20[ (2.1%). PP is the most diagnosed pathology (32.7%), followed by RA (29.9%), AS (22.0%), PA (12.8%) and PJIA (2.6%). The majority of patients diagnosed with PA, AS and PP are male (53.7%, 50.8% and 60.7%, respectively), while patients diagnosed with RA and PJIA are mostly female (78.3% and 65.1%, respectively). Patients are mostly adults or elderly, with the exception of those diagnosed with PJIA who are mostly younger than 30 years old (84.6%). Adalimumab was the most dispensed medicine to patients with AS (36.1%) and PJIA (41.1%); etanercept to patients with RA (33.7%) and PA (32.0%); ustecinumab to patients with PP (47.6%). Differences in prescribing pattern were observed between private and public sector, in particular in the area of dermatology.

5212,"Background: The use of biologics for treatment of plaque psoriasis (PsO) is typically reserved for situations where symptoms are not well controlled with traditional topical and systemic therapies. Treatment patterns of biologics for PsO in the real-world setting are not well understood. Objectives: The objective of this research was to describe secular trends in the use of biologics for the treatment of plaque psoriasis (PsO) using real-world data. Methods: Patients from 6 specialty dermatology networks and 2 integrated delivery networks within the OMNY Health Dermatology Platform with any indication of PsO (diagnosis code: L40.0) from 2014- 2021 were included. Demographic characteristics were tabulated at first PsO diagnosis. PsO severity was characterized for patients with data on body surface area and/or physician global assessment. Annual percentages of patients with prescriptions for biologics currently approved for treatment of PsO were computed. Secular trends in annual treatment patterns were described. Results: Across all years, a total of 159 818 unique PsO patients with prescription or procedure data were included. Patients were 55% female, 13% nonwhite (among known categories), and 44% ages  60 years with diverse geographical distribution in the United States. Adalimumab use increased steadily from 3.2% to 4.3% while etanercept use decreased steadily from 2.1% to 0.56%. Ustekinumab use increased from 1.6% in 2014, peaked at 2.9% in 2017, then decreased to 2.4% in 2021. Continued increased use over the observation period was also observed for secukinumab (0.96% in 2016 to 3.6%), ixekizumab (0.78% in 2017 to 3.5%), risankizumab (1.5% in 2019 to 5.4%), and guselkumab (1.5% in 2018 to 3.4%). Smaller proportions of patients were prescribed certolizumab, infliximab, brodalumab, and tildrakizumab (< 0.5% in any year). Overall, PsO patient exposure to any biologic therapy exhibited a monotonically linear increase from 6.7% in 2014 to 22% in 2021 with an average rate of 2.2% per year. For patients with severity data, the trend for biologic use decreased slightly over the observation period for mild and moderate patients while it increased for severe patients. On average, severe patients were 2.5 times as likely as moderate patients and 4.5 times as likely as mild patients to have been expose to biologic therapy. Conclusions: Results provide insights into real-world trends in use of biologics for treatment of PsO. Overall, patient use of biologics increased steadily over the observation period with decreased use of some therapies being replaced with increased use of other therapies. Trends varied by PsO severity. Given the multiple approved indications for some of the biologics, further analyzes would be helpful to use for patients with multiple indications.",1.0,area,True

Lack of information for the comparison of IL-17 inhibitor (IL17i) or IL-12/23 inhibitor (IL12/23i) with conventional systemic immunosuppressants (TSI) on the risk of HZ in patients with psoriasis. Furthermore, evaluation on the risk of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is scarce. Objectives: To compare the risk of HZ and PHN in patients with psoriasis receiving IL17i and IL12/23i versus TSI. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study by analysing data from National Health Insurance Database (NHID 2004-2018) in Taiwan. We included adult patients aged 20 years and above diagnosed with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis (ICD-9-CM 696, ICD10-L40) receiving biologics (etanercept, adalimumab, ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab) or TSI (methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin) for more than three months. Primary outcome of study was diagnosis of HZ (ICD-9-CM 053, ICD-10-B02) and the secondary outcome was diagnosis of PHN ((ICD-9-CM 053, ICD-10-B02) and the use of low level laser therapy 1 (51032B) or analgesics for at least 6 weeks. The patients were followed from initiation of IL17i and IL12/23i or TSI for 2 years or until the occurrence of outcome or death. We performed Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models to compare the risk of HZ and PHN between IL17i, IL12/23i with the reference group of TSI, with adjustment of patients' age, sex, comorbidities and co-medications. Results: We identified a total of 400 and 1678 patients with psoriasis receiving IL17i and IL12/23i group with the average age of patients 46.6 (SD 13.1) and 46.4 (SD 13.6) years, respectively. We found the incidence rates of HZ were 6.8, 14.5 and 12.7 per 1000 person-years for IL17i, IL12/23i and TSI groups, respectively. Comparing with patients receiving TSI, we found the risk of IL17i (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.16-2.58) and IL12/23i (1.36; 0.98-1.88) was not associated with increased risk of HZ. The incidence rates of PHN were 0.0, 2.4 and 2.9 per 1000 person-years for IL17i, IL12/23i and TSI groups, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found among IL17i, IL12/23i and TSI groups on the risk of PHN.

Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of biological disease-modifying drugs (bDMARD) used in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis. Methods: This is a cohort, in which patients diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, with first prescription of bDMARD in the Unified Health System in Brazil, as of 2018 by the State Health Secretariat of the State of Minas Gerais, were followed for at least 6 months. Outcomes such as maintenance to drug therapy, therapeutic failure, and discontinuation were evaluated. Results: 235 patients were followed, 54% of whom were male, with a mean age of 43 years. Adalimumab was prescribed for 41.7% of patients as first-line bDMARD treatment, followed by golimumab (25.1%) and infliximab (16.2%).

5225,"Background: Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that preferentially affects the spine and is the most frequent rheumatic condition within the group of spondyloarthritis. The prevalence in the population may vary according to location and affects mostly young white males. The Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) provides treatment for patients diagnosed with AS, and includes in its clinical protocol the biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMAD): adalimumab, etanercepte, infliximab, golimumab, certolizumab, and secuquinumab. Maintenance of drug therapy is critical to treatment success and has an impact on both patients' quality of life and health care costs. There are several factors that may influence adherence, and the pandemic COVID-19 has arrived as a new barrier to this end. Objectives: To evaluate the epidemiological and clinical profile of patients diagnosed with AS who had biological therapy abandonment as an outcome, as well as to analyze the influence of the pandemic by COVID-19, in this context. Methods: This is a cohort, in which patients diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, with first prescription of bDMAD in the SUS, Brazil, as of 2018 by the State Health Secretariat of the State of Minas Gerais, were followed for at least 6 months.

Biological disease course modifying drugs (bDMARD) such as anti-TNF adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercepte, golimumab, and infliximab, and non-anti-TNF abatacepte, rituximab, and tocilizumab, can be used in cases where there is persistent disease activity, already the synthetic target-specific disease course modifying drugs (sDMARD) such as baricitinib, tofacitinib and upadacitinib are also indicated as alternative therapies after failure of other treatments. Objectives: To evaluate the profile of the use of bDMARD and sDMARD in the treatment of RA by the Unified Health System (SUS) in Brazil. Methods: This is a cohort in which patients diagnosed with RA who started using bDMARD and sDMARD, provided by the Specialized Component of Pharmaceutical Services (CEAF) in Minas Gerais, were followed from 2018. Results: A total of 352 patients were followed, of which 86% were female, with a mean age of 55 years and an estimated disease duration of 12 years. Tofacitinib was the most used drug in the first line of treatment (21.0%), followed by the anti-TNF biological DMARD adalimumab (20.2%) and golimumab (20.2%), and by the anti-CTL4Ig abatacept (6.0%). Of the 352 patients, 69 (19.6%) switched therapy, the main reason for switching being therapeutic failure. Of the patients who failed after using the first biologic, 18, 6% used tofacitinib as a second therapeutic option. Among the therapies with the highest rate of use, abatacept had the lowest failure rate (4.8%) followed by tofacitinib (8.1%). Adalimumab was the drug with the highest incidence of therapeutic failure (28.2%). Of the patients who failed after using the first biologic, 4.8% used tofacitinib as a second therapeutic option. Conclusions: The data from this study demonstrate that tofacitinib was the most prescribed drug, both in the first and second therapeutic options. This finding may be associated with the greater preference of patients for sDMARD, as they have the advantages of being administered orally and not requiring refrigeration for storage.

5235,"Background: Brodalumab is a biological anti-psoriatic drug marketed in Europe since 2017. A post-authorization safety study was commissioned by the EMA to investigate safety of brodalumab in a real-world context, with regards to 1) serious infections, 2) major adverse cardiac events, 3) suicidal behavior, and 4) malignancies. Objectives: The present abstract introduces the BRAHMS study and provides an overview of the underlying research collaboration and methods. Further, the first results on the study population are provided. Methods: A collaborative consortium including data sources from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany, PHARMO Database Network in the Netherlands, and Italy was established, in total accounting for an overall population of ~50 million inhabitants. All brodalumab users with a diagnosis of psoriasis from 2017-2028 are enrolled and compared with users of other biological anti-psoriatic drugs including TNF-alfa inhibitors (etanercept and adalimumab), IL-12 and IL-23 inhibitors (ustekinumab), and other IL-17A inhibitors (secukinumab and ixekizumab). Multiple designs are used, including active comparator new user design, case-time control design and comparative designs for cumulative drug exposure. Each site transforms data into a BRAHMS-specific common data model. Analysis code is prepared centrally and run on the local instances of the common data model. Only aggregate results are shared between sites. A framework for defining study variables is developed which allows flexible site-specific adaptations hereof. The study is approved by EMA and conducted according to the ENCePP code of conduct. Results: Until December 2021, we have identified approx. 1150 brodalumab users since the launching of brodalumab in 2017 (with varying data availability).

5242,"Background: Insulin glargine's innovator and two biosimilar products are approved in Saudi Arabia to improve glycemic control in adults and children age 2 years and above with diabetes mellitus. The identification of brand name and batch number are essential components in reporting adverse drug events (ADEs) of biological medicines due to the variability of biomanufacturing process that may cause safety risks such as immunogenicity. Objectives: To assess the availability of batch number and tradename of reported insulin glargine (reference and biosimilar) ADEs to the National Pharmacovigilance Center (NPC) database. Methods: We performed a descriptive analysis of spontaneous ADE reports of insulin glargine (reference and biosimilar) in Saudi Arabia reported to the NPC from January 1, 2010 to January 10, 2022. The analysis examined the reporting frequency of batch number, and tradename. Results: The study identified 410 ADE reports of insulin glargine. There were 368 (89.8%) reports linked to innovator product, 30 (7.3%) reports linked to biosimilar product. The remaining (11; 2.7%) reports did not include the tradename. The batch number was included in 216 (52.7%) of reported cases. 215 (52.4%) ADE reports included both the batch number and the tradename. The majority of cases did not indicate the reporter type (300; 73.2%). The remaining 110 ADE reports were submitted by a healthcare professional, of which, 41 (37.3%) included both tradename and batch number, 67 (60.1%) included on only the tradename, and 2 (1.8%) reports did not include the tradename or batch number. Conclusions: The analysis demonstrates limitation of spontaneous ADE reports of insulin glargine (reference and biosimilar) due to not including batch number of the reported ADEs.

Methods: The PATHFINDER study (EUPAS29263) is a retrospective population-based study conducted on Tuscan healthcare administrative database (HAD). We included first-ever bDMARD users for RA with a visit at the Rheumatology ward of Pisa University Hospital from 2013 to 2016. The index date was defined by the first dispensation date of bDMARD. We extracted the drug supplies from HAD and the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) from medical charts. In the 3 years follow-up, we measured discontinuations, as the result of the coverage of each bDMARD dispensation, based on the Defined Daily Dose, and the number of doses supplied plus a grace period of 60 and 30 days in the main and sensitivity analyzes, respectively. We assessed DAS28 before (T0), after (T1) the first bDMARD supply, and before (TD0), after (TD1) discontinuation. We selected patients with at least 3 DAS28 available and stratified by discontinuation occurrence, testing the difference in disease activity recorded at T1.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using National Health Insurance data (NHID) from 2003-2018. We compared CD patients on biological therapy in the post-biological era (POB, 2011- 2018) with a historical control group as biologics-naïve CD patients in pre-biological era (PRB, 2003-2010). For the POB, the index date was the first biological prescription date. For PRB, the index date was randomly assigned by computer according to the duration between the first CD-related medication and first biologics date of the POB. Study outcome defined as mild infections (outpatients visit) and severe infection (emergency room visit, or hospitalization). To control the measurable confounding factors, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) estimation was applied.

Methods: Data from BADBIR, a prospective pharmacovigilance register investigating the long term safety of systemic and biologic therapies prescribed to patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, were analyzed. Eligible patients were 16 years receiving a first course of MTX or ADN between 2007-2021 with 6 months' follow-up and biologic-naïve at registration. Effectiveness was defined as achieving absolute Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 2 using a minimum PASI (in case of multiple PASI records per individual) reported 13 weeks after treatment start date until stop date. Average treatment effects (ATE) was estimated using inverse probability of treatment weighting with propensity score included age, gender, Body Mass Index, disease severity and duration, smoking, alcohol consumption, previous non-biologic systemics, comorbidities and psoriatic arthritis. Results of ATE was presented as Risk Ratio (RR). Exposure time was calculated from therapy initiation to censor at stop date, latest follow-up, or death. Flexible parametric model estimated adjusted standardized average survival (persistence) (AS), defined as treatment discontinuation due to the lack of effectiveness, occurrence of adverse events or other reasons, at 6, 12 and 24 months. Multiple imputed datasets for missing baseline and outcome data were used. Results: In total, 6575 patients (median age 44 years; 44% female) were analyzed with 2659 (40%) prescribed MTX and 3916 (60%) prescribed ADN. The proportion of patients achieving PASI2 was lower in the MTX cohort (37%) compared with the ADN cohort (77%). Patients prescribed ADN were 2x more likely to achieve effectiveness than patients prescribed MTX [RR 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-2.5].

When applicable, code modifiers were used in addition to unspecified HCPCS to identify biosimilars. Biosimilars either newly marketed or blocked due to patent litigation were not evaluated. Patients were required to have at least one day of enrollment to be included. Annual dispensings for 24 biosimilars and their 8 referent products were evaluated. Percent market share was also evaluated as total number of biosimilar dispensings divided by total number of product dispensings. Results: We identified 1 587 360 total biologic dispensings among 303 690 patients in 2015, of which 173 (0.01%) were for biosimilars.

We found no primary diagnoses of chronic respiratory failure, heart failure, or myocardial infarctions at 3 months-post-discharge, with analysis of additional outcomes ongoing. Conclusions: Improved understanding of long-term health consequences associated with COVID-19 infection and hospitalization is critical to inform patient care as the pandemic progresses. Medicaid data provides a unique opportunity to study this question in underinsured individuals, particularly due to statewide holds on Medicaid disenrollment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and timeliness of data availability.

Pathological stage was measured from tumor specimens at the time of surgery and categorized into stage I to III based on the American Joint Cancer Committee 8th edition. Logistic regression adjusting for demographic and clinicopathologic confounders was used to assess the association between tumor location and pathological stage. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess overall survival associated with tumor location adjusting for the same confounders. Results: In our cohort, a total of 3614 had a nonmetastatic tumor in the low rectum and received selective surgeries during the study period; 633 (17.6%), 881 (24.4%), 1011 (28.0%), and 1089 (30.0%) tumors were located at 0-2cm (ultra-low), 2-3cm, 3-4cm and 4-5cm from the anal verge, respectively. Of stage III tumors, 32.5% were located at 4-5cm from the anal verge compared to 26.3% of stage I. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that the odds of advanced pathological stage in tumors 0-2cm, 2-3cm, and 3-4cm, respectively, were less likely compared to tumors 4-5cm from the anal verge (0-2cm vs. 4-5cm: OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.92; 2-3cm vs. 4-5cm: OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.61-0.85; 3-4cm vs. 4-5cm: OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70-0.95).

Outcome: Labor market affiliation: employment, sickness absence, social transfer payments (employment-ready), passive social transfer payments, and disability pension. Further, labor market indicators based on the patients' different labor market affiliations was calculated Statistical analysis: Sequence analysis and unconditional logistic regression analysis presented with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: At the index week, 14.1% of patients with TRD were in employment compared with 26.4% among non-TRD patients. Over time, the proportion of patients in employment increased slightly. The proportion of TRD patients with sickness absence at the index week was 47.0% and 26.2% for non-TRD patients. The adjusted odds of a below mean volatility of labor market transitions, characterized by more episodes in passive social transfer payments and disability pension, were higher among patients with TRD compared with non-TRD patients (OR 1.63, 95% CI [1.56-1.69]). Similarly, the adjusted odds of a below mean integration into employment were 1.63 higher among TRD patients compared with non-TRD patients (95% CI [1.56-1.70]).

Results: We identified a total of 967 systematic reviews and metaanalyzes, of which 453 were included for title and abstract screening. A total of 98 publications were retrieved for full-text review, among which 39 publications (22 systematic reviews and 17 meta-analyzes) were retained for final data extraction. Top reasons for exclusion included not meeting the long COVID-19 definition or not being a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study from 2000- 2018 using individual-level data from Danish medical registries. The Danish National Prescription Registry was used to identify individuals (40 years) with a first-time redeemed prescription of memantine or an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Individuals with an ICD diagnosis of dementia registered in the DNPR or the DPCRR prior to, or on, the date of the redeemed prescription were excluded. We followed these individuals from date of redemption of their prescription until an inpatient or outpatient diagnosis of dementia recorded in the DNPR or DPCRR, death, emigration, 5 years of follow-up, or end of study period, whichever came first. The cumulative incidence with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of a dementia diagnosis in the DNPR was calculated after 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years, treating death as a competing risk. Results: A total of 16 852 individuals (54% female) were identified with a prescription redemption during the study period. Median age was 79 years (interquartile range: 73-84). Of these, 2009 (12%) had redeemed a prescription of memantine and 14 843 (88%) a prescription of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.

The 5-year mortality was 54% (95% CI: 53%-55%). Conclusions: After five years, only 56% of patients redeeming a prescription of memantine or an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor were identified in the DNPR or DPCCR with an inpatient or outpatient diagnosis of dementia. This finding may be explained by high mortality among dementia patients, absence of any hospital encounter resulting in a primary or secondary dementia diagnosis, and the prescription of dementia medications for non-approved indications.",1.0,,True

Objectives: To investigate and compare methods for the construction of confidence intervals (CIs) for the average estimates of incidence. Methods: We used Lyme Borreliosis (LB) surveillance data available from 24 European countries to demonstrate the performance of different methods. The average number of cases or incidence over a multi-year period was calculated as the weighted estimate of the annual number of cases, or yearly incidence with weights equal to the yearly denominators. We used the combination of stratum-specific CIs, based on the F-distribution, to calculate the 95% CI for the average incidence. A simulation study was performed to compare the performance of this method with the conventional imputation method. In the imputation method, the mean annual population was used as the denominator, and the mean annual number of cases was the numerator. We considered various scenarios where we varied the population size, the true proportion, and the number of data points to be averaged. Finally, these methods were applied to quantify the LB average incidence in 24 European countries. Results: The simulation study showed that our method produced higher coverage probability and equivalently (very) small bias when compared to the imputation method. More specifically, the coverage probability using the imputation method decreased substantially (from 94% in the best scenario to below 20% in the worst case). The method we used, in contrast, preserved good coverage in all scenarios (above 95%). To our data application, average LB incidence varies considerably in Europe (from 0.2 in Portugal to 81.3 in France and 263 cases per 100 000 person-years in Estonia). Conclusions: The proposed method (weighted average with 95 % stratum-specific CI based on F-distribution) is straightforward to implement and provided better estimates compared to the conventional imputation method.

Exposure on individual-drug as well as group- and subgroup level (3- and 4-character level of AnatomicTherapeutic Chemical Classification system) was assessed from the Prescription register since 1995. Univariable associations of exposures that had occurred at least three years before the index date (PD diagnosis date of the referent case) were assessed in the screening sample with conditional logistic regression with significance level P ,"" 0.1 as threshold. Exposure prior to index date was considered in sensitivity analyzes. In confounder-adjusted replication analyzes different exposure periods were used. Results: The results reflect the known risk factors (e.g., smoking and cancer) and the implied role of immune system in PD pathogenesis as well as spurious associations. Two groups (antipsoriatics and antigout preparations) and 4 subgroups (cicatrizants, antipsoriatics for topical use, antigout preparations and mydriatics and cycloplegics) met the screening threshold. The group-level associations were mainly driven by associations of individual drugs. Seven other drugs (for example methotrexate, drugs for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD) associated with lower risk. In sensitivity analyzes, group-level association was observed with antineoplastic drugs, driven by methotrexate. In addition, 3 diabetes drugs and 5 COPD drugs met the screening threshold. Antigout preparations and antipsoriatics were the only exposure whose association was confirmed in replication.

5341,"Background: In healthy adults, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is stable until approximately 40 years of age after which it declines by ~1 ml/min/year. Consequently, the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is defined as an eGFR < 60 ml/ min/1.73 m2, increases with age. Another risk factor for CKD is acute kidney injury (AKI), which is defined by an abrupt decline in kidney function often related to treatment with nephrotoxic drugs.",1.0,disease,True
5342,"Intriguingly, even if AKI is transient and kidney function recovers, it increases the risk of developing CKD. This could be reflected by a drop in eGFR level, a decrease in eGFR slope, or a combination of both. However, data describing the changes in eGFR level or eGFR slope from before to after AKI are sparse and conflicting. Objectives: To describe changes in eGFR level and eGFR slope from before to after first-time AKI in individuals with repeated measurements before and after AKI. Methods: Using Danish population-based laboratory databases linked with health and administrative databases, we included individuals with first-time AKI defined by an acute increase in plasma creatinine (pCr) during 2010 to 2017. We restricted the population to individuals with an outpatient baseline eGFR 8-365 days before AKI and three or more outpatient pCr measurements both before and after AKI. Individuals were stratified by baseline eGFR (/< 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and linear regression models were used to estimate and compare individual eGFR slopes and eGFR levels before and after AKI. Results: We identified 265 161 individuals with first-time AKI. Of these 98 072 individuals had an outpatient baseline eGFR and three or more pCr measurements both before and after AKI and were included for further analyzes. Included individuals were younger and had a substantially lower one-year mortality compared with individuals not included. Among included individuals with AKI, 64 805 (66%) had a baseline eGFR 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 33 267 (34%) had a baseline eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. In individuals with a baseline eGFR 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, AKI was associated with a median difference in eGFR level of À5.6 ml/min/1.73 m2 (interquartile range [IQR], À67 (34%) had a baseline eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2.

Our cohort consisted of individuals with comorbid depression and T2DM. Participants entered the study at the date of their first oral antidiabetic prescription, and were excluded if they had a prescription for insulin less than 6 months after the date of the first oral antidiabetic. We identified 11 862 cases as participants who received a prescription for insulin during the their electronic health record (EHR) follow-up. We matched these to 43 452 controls who had not yet received any prescription for insulin, based on age, gender, GP practice and length of follow-up. We used conditional logistic regression to describe the association between antidepressant prescribing during follow-up and starting insulin. We adjusted for demographic and health characteristics, and previous medication use. Results: Cases who commenced insulin were similar to controls who had not yet commenced insulin, with regards to demographic characteristics and previous medication use. Cases had higher prevalence at study entry of all comorbidities. After adjusting for all covariates: Any antidepressant use was associated with almost 4x higher rate of starting insulin therapy (rate ratio 3.78, 3.53-4.04). There was no evidence of a difference between recent and past antidepressant use. Higher cumulative durations of antidepressant use (24+ months - RR 5.61, 5.23-6.03) were associated with further increased rate of insulin commencement, compared to shorter durations (< 6 months - RR 3.94, 3.64-4.27). SSRIs were associated with the highest rate of commencing insulin (RR 3.14, 2.98-3.31) and mirtazapine with the lowest increased rate (RR 1.87, 1.74-2.01). Conclusions: Antidepressant prescribing is associated with a large increase in the rate of commencing insulin having started oral antidiabetic treatment in people with comorbid depression and T2DM. The effect may be due in part to antidepressant users being individuals with more severe depression, as we were unable to sufficiently control for this.",1.0,case,True

CPGs have the potential to improve the quality of patient care and patient outcomes, but embracing low-quality guidelines may result in widespread use of inefficient practices and harm to patients. The increasing use of CPGs growth, as well as concerns about their quality, has prompted for the assessment of the quality of guidelines and their reporting. Objectives: To assess the quality of latest guidelines published by the NCCN. Methods: We included guidelines published by the NCCN in the year 2020. Two authors independently assessed CPGs by using two popular quality assessment tools AGREE-II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation) and RIGHT (Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Health Care) Statement. Disagreements between the authors were resolved by consensus with a third author. Data extraction was performed using Microsoft Excel. Based on the score obtained for each CPG, quality of the guidelines was evaluated. Results: A total of 59 CPGs were identified. We assessed scores of all CPGs by using AGREE II. Compared to other domains, the domains ""Clarity of presentation"" & ""Editorial independence"" scored high with mean percent scores of 81.4% and 95.8%, respectively. The domain clarity of presentation includes whether the recommendations are specific and clear, key recommendations are easily identifiable or not. Editorial independence includes funding and conflicts of interests. The domain ""Stakeholder involvement"" scored the lowest among all domains with mean percent score of 49%. It includes regarding guideline developing group, values and preferences of the patients. In the assessment that used the RIGHT statement, the domain ""Funding and interest"" reported highest among all domains with mean percent score of 100% and includes about conflict of interests. The domains ""Evidence"" and ""Recommendations"", reported lowest for all CPGs with mean percent scores of 30% and 49.8%, respectively. Evidence includes whether the guideline is based on approach used to assess the certainty of body of evidence and recommendations includes whether guidelines provide clear, precise and actionable recommendations. Overall assessment for all CPGs shows ""Recommend with modifications"".

Objectives: To determine the antihypertensive prescription pattern and its effect on blood pressure control in patients with CKD attending the nephrology outpatient clinic of a tertiary healthcare facility in Lagos, Nigeria. Methods: A cross-sectional study with retrospective follow-up of 154 participants with CKD who were 18 years of age or older, had at least two clinic visits and consented to participate in the study. A structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to retrieve socio-demographic and clinical data from participants. The etiology of CKD, co-morbid conditions, prescribed antihypertensive medications, clinic blood pressure records, and results of laboratory investigations were retrieved from the participant's hospital records. Results: Participants were divided into sextiles based on their baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure values and the mean of absolute blood pressure reduction was determined for each quartile. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the means of absolute blood pressure reduction across the sextiles. The level of statistical significance was set at P-value less than 0.05. Forty-eight percent of participants were males while the mean age of the study population was 59.5 + 12.1 years. Overall, hypertension was present in 92.9% of participants.

We followed them from urticaria diagnosis date until the first of: incident cancer diagnosis, death, emigration, or end of study (31 December 2018). We calculated cumulative incidence of cancer, treating death as a competing risk, and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) as measures of relative cancer risk using Danish national cancer rates.

However, with the rising breast cancer diagnosed at an older age (70 years) and increasing primary endocrine therapy (PET) used for treating older women, the survival of women with breast cancer in different age strata is still inconclusive. Objectives: This matched cohort study compared the survival of women without cancer against women with breast cancer, considering the age and treatments. Methods: The study cohort, women with newly-diagnosed, earlystage breast cancer, were identified from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (Gold and Aurum) linking to Hospital Episode Statistics, Cancer Registry, and national death registration from 2000 to 2016 in England, and matched (1:5) to women without cancer by age, gender, and general practice on the diagnosed date (index date). Cohort and matched cohort were followed from index date to the date of death, and the survival was stratified by age strata (younger 50-69 years; older 70 years). Survival of cohort was further stratified by treatments (surgery or PET). Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis compared the 5 and 10-year survival rates and adjusted for Hospital Risk Frailty Score and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Results: The cohort (58 808) and matched cohort (297 732) have a similar proportion (39.337.2%) of older women.

After adjusting for risk factors, the survival of matched cohort remained superior to the study cohort.

5405,"Background: Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) tend to develop a constellation of chronic comorbidities over time. These are associated with high drug utilization and adverse events. There is an increasing need for understanding the frequently complex disease progression over time. Some methodological approaches have been applied, for instance using latent class growth analysis (LCGA) or principal component analysis (PCA). Nonetheless, Bayesian nonparametric methods have not yet been used for T2DM comorbidity progression. Objectives: We aimed to find different profiles of patients and their disease progression after T2DM onset using Bayesian nonparametric models in primary care electronic medical records. Methods: The IQVIA Medical Research Data incorporating data from THIN, a Cegedim database of anonymized electronic health records, was used to identify all patients with a first-ever prescription for a non-insulin antidiabetic drug (NIAD) between January 2006 and December 2019. In order to understand disease progression, we selected 50 chronic comorbidities of interest. We used Bayesian nonparametric latent models to model disease clusters and their progression over time and computed the ObservedExpected (O/E) ratio to identify comorbidities with a higher prevalence than expected. Results: A total of 175 383 patients were included in the study (97 148 males, 78 235 females), who were on average 60.4 years old and had a BMI of 32.5 at index date (start of NIAD). Progression patterns could be explained by 14 latent features, each of them associated with a specific main disease. We found that cardiovascular diseases such as congestive heart failure or intermittent claudication were rapidly progressing in T2DM patients. Moreover, we observed that the onset of certain diseases led to the appearance of further complications. For instance, the onset of congestive heart failure was associated to an increase in the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and atrial fibrillation.

5412,"Background: Standing cohorts of real-world patients reflecting participants of randomized clinical trials (RCT) can be used during clinical development to contextualize potential adverse events observed in the RCT population. It is critical to derive a cohort that is comparable to the RCT participants on key baseline characteristics. However, not all selection criteria applied in an RCT may be practically applicable in a real-world dataset. Objectives: To create a standing cohort of patients with myocardial infarction (MI) by applying varying selection criteria to mimic an RCT population and describe relevant characteristics of such patients in the real-world. Methods: As an example, inclusion criteria applied in an RCT (AEGISII, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03473223) were retrieved and used sequentially as well as in several iterative combinations to identify comparable patients in IQVIA PharMetrics Plus database. Patients 18 years of age and older with an MI that occurred between 01 January 2016 and 31 December 2020 and had at least one year of observation in the database prior to the MI were the source population. Given the inherent limitation of the RWD source, not all RCT criteria could be applied. Sub-cohorts were created applying the following filters of various complexities: 1) Age 65 years, 2) History of peripheral artery disease (PAD), 3) 65 years with history of PAD, 4) History of diabetes mellitus (DM), 5) 65 years with history of DM, 6) History of DM and PAD, and 7) 65 years with history of DM and PAD. Descriptive analyzes of baseline characteristics were performed. The number and percentage of patients in each category were used to describe categorical variables and mean and standard deviation (SD) were used to describe continuous variables. Results: There were 457 068 patients who met the inclusion criteria in the overall cohort. The average age was 62.9 years and 63.8% were male.

The difference in the medians of the HRQoL scores was statistically significant (p < 0.05) at the comparison between baseline and after first line chemotherapy for seven HRQoL scales. Lower family income and peripheral neuropathy reflected on worse HRQoL scores; receiving ASCT suggested better scores. Patients using VTd regimen achieved better scores compared to thalidomide-based regimens. Conclusion: HRQoL of NDMM patients can be improved after first line of treatment. Lower family income and peripheral neuropathy may worsen HRQoL. ASCT may improve patients HRQoL and VTd regimen was related with better HRQoL than thalidomide-based regimens.

Methods: Study design, Setting, & Population: This study utilized a longitudinal prospective cohort study design. A sample of 360 nondialysis CKD patients (eGFR 90-15ml/min/1.73 m2) (210 male, & 150 female) aged 53.7 ± 13.9 years were enrolled at a special nephro clinic of a tertiary care public teaching hospital. Follow up: Over a period of more than 12 months. Materials: Uric acid and serum creatinine and other lab parameters were measured at each patient visit.

Objectives: To determine whether integrating medical concepts extracted from the narrative notes from the electronic health record (EHR) data using natural language processing (NLP) can improve the identification of gout flares. Methods: Using Medicare data (2007-16) linked with EHR data from two tertiary care centers, we selected individuals with age65 and 1 gout ICD code who initiated the urate-lowering therapy (ULT). Patients were required to have a 12-month baseline period with continuous insurance enrollment before initiation. The baseline period and on-treatment follow-up were segmented into 1-month units. We then retrieved EHR notes for months with gout ICD codes in claims. We selected a random sample of patients and reviewed each of their notes for the presence of ongoing gout flare based on the physician documentation of gout flare as the gold standard. Months containing 1+ notes with ongoing gout flares were considered months with a gout flare event. We then used 60% of patients to train predictive models with LASSO using claims variables only, EHR medical concepts only, and both combined. We evaluated the added value of medical concepts by comparing the area under the curve (AUC) of ROCs in the 40% validation data. The top three variables by the magnitude of coefficients were listed.

Sample weights were applied to generate nationally representative estimates for patients aged 18+ years old having diagnosis of T1DN or T2DN. Patients were excluded if the encounter included both T1DN and T2DN or if disposition at index was deceased. Demographics, comorbidities, length of stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality and cost-to-charge adjusted charges (costs) were stratified and compared using chi-square and t-tests. Results: At index, 10 003 and 122 327 patients were identified as T1DN and T2DN, respectively. A total 261 957 (T1DN , 24 359; T2DN , 237 598) index events and 22 692 readmissions (T1DN , 3266; T2DN ,"" 19 426) were identified. 30-day readmission rates were higher in T2DN compared to T1DN (13.41% vs 8.18%, p < .0001). Readmitted patients were younger for T1DN at median (Q1-Q3) age of 40 (31-53) yrs. vs. T2DN at 66 (57-75) yrs. (p<.0001). More T1DN and T2DN were males (51.2%, 55.8%) vs. females (48.8%, 44.2%) at index (p<.0001). More T1DN readmissions were females (52.7%) (p<.0001). Medicare was primary payer for T2DN and T1DN at index (70.3%, 49.7%) and readmission (71.2%, 50.3%) (p < 0.0001). Greater mortality risk was observed at index and readmission among T2DN with median (Q1-Q3) CCI score of 6 (5-7) vs. 5 (4-6) for T1DN (p<.0001).

5485,"Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Approximately 1.5-2% of PD cases in the US have leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) variants, with G2019S being the most common genetic variant. Both familial and sporadic occurrence of PD may result from the LRRK2 variants. There is a paucity of published data on the demographic distribution (by race, ethnicity and sex) for the PD population in the US. Objectives: To summarize demographics of race, ethnicity, and sex among the PD population, both all-cause PD and LRRK2-PD, in the US. Methods: We leveraged several resources including published literature, the Optum® de-identified electronic health record (OPEHR) data (2017-2020; N,~104 million patients; N ,"" 154 148 PD cases), and the Fox Insight (FI) study (data lock May 2021; N "","" 30 872 PD cases). In the OPEHR, persons with PD were defined by having >1 ICD-9 332.0 or ICD-10 G20 without a record of secondary parkinsonism or atypical Parkinson syndromes. Genetic data were not available in OPEHR. To date, FI is the largest observational cohort study for PD, including participants with self-reported PD diagnosis, and genetic data on a subset of participants. Within FI, two analyzes were conducted: one for all PD participants (N "", 30 872) and one for LRRK2-PD participants with genetically confirmed G2019S LRRK2 variant (N ,"" 220). Results: Consistent with the literature, the demographic distributions were as follows for all PD cases in OPEHR/FI, respectively: White 84%/87%; African American 5%/1%; Asian 1.5%/1%; Hispanic 3%/7%; female 41%/41%. Similarly, the demographic distribution of LRRK2-PD in FI was consistent with the literature: White (95% in FI; 95%-97% in literature) Asian (1% in both), African-American (<1% in both), Hispanic (8% in FI; 5% in literature), and female (46% in FI; 50% in literature). Conclusions: Results across these US databases were consistent with findings from the literature that PD cases most commonly identified as White and non-Hispanic, at percentages that are higher than in the general US population. A slight male preponderance was noted in the overall PD population. Additional research using random population-based sampling of ethnoracial minorities with PD is needed.""",1.0,disease,True

5491,"Background: Health outcomes of the working-age generation are essential in considering the social economy. However, the incidence and prognosis for young stroke patients, due to its rarity, have not been fully described in a Japanese population. Objectives: The study's objective is to describe the incidence and fatal outcomes in Japanese young adult stroke patients Methods: We analyzed data from the Shiga Stroke and Heart Attack Registry, which captured all stroke occurrences in a population of Shiga Prefecture, Japan. Age at onset was categorized into three groups; 18-40 years old (young), 41-59 (adult), 60-85 (elderly), and patients with >86 years old are excluded. For each age group of stroke patients, we describe the baseline characteristics, the incidence of stroke types, modified ranking scale (mRS) at discharge, and survival proportion after onset. Results: During 2011 À2013, there were 153 young patients (103 men, 50 women), 1172 adult patients (792 men, 380 women), and 5594 elderly patients (3387 men, 2207 women). The proportion with mRS of 0-1 and 205 were 48% and 41% in young, 46% and 45% in adults, while they were 28% and 49% in elderly. Although the proportions of mortality during hospitalization were similar among all age groups, long-term mortality differs among age groups (12% in young, 16% in adults, and 39% in elderly). In terms of stroke subtype, the mortality proportion with ischemic stroke was lower in young (40%), and adult (52%) relative to elderly (71%), and SAH is higher in young (27%) and adult (16%) relative to elderly (6%). Conclusions: Our analysis suggested some heterogeneity of incident patterns of stroke subtype and its prognosis among young, adults, and elderly age groups.

Methods: This is a population-based study including patients of all ages registered in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database from 2016 to 2019. The IR of AH (defined via Read code: J611, J617, J617000) was calculated overall and for each year between 2016 and 2019. The numerator was defined as number of patients newly diagnosed with AH in a given year. The denominator consisted of the person-time at risk contributed by all cohort members in that year. All patients had to be enrolled at least one year before and patients diagnosed with AH in previous years were excluded. IRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were also calculated by gender and age categories (< 18 years, 18-65 years, >65 years). The study was approved by the relevant board (ISAC protocol No: 20_000122). Results: We identified 19'269'538 patients registered in the CPRD during the study period. The number of patients with AH from 2016 to 2019 was 430; the cumulative IR was 0.57 cases per 100 000 PYs (95% CI: 0.52-0.63). The IR increased from 2016 to 2017 to a maximum of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.53-0.76) per 100 000 PY and decreased to 0.58 (95% CI: 0.48-0.70) in 2018, and 0.53 (95% CI: 0.44-0.65) in 2019. Men represented 63.7% of patients with AH, and had a cumulative IR of 0.77 per 100 000 PYs (95% CI: 0.68-0.86), whereas women represented 36.3% of patients and had a rate of 0.40 per 100 000 PYs (95% CI: 0.34-0.47). When stratified by age, no AH case was observed among patients < 18 years. Patients 18-65 years represented 92.6% of all cases over the entire study period. The cumulative IR within this age group (18-65 years) was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.70-0.86) per 100 000 PYs. Patients above 65 years had an IR of 0.21 (95% CI: 0.14-0.29) per 100 000 PYs Conclusions: This is the first study, which evaluates the IR of AH by age and gender over time in the UK. The IR of AH did not significantly change over time. Men had higher annual IRs than women. We found no cases of AH among pediatric population. The highest IR of AH was among patients 18-65 years, so any intervention would be most beneficial among this group of patients.",1.0,Clinical,True

5501,"Background: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) necessitates distinct treatment practice relative to treatment-responsive depression, but the treatment pathway from incidence to resistance remains under-reported. As we evaluate the survival consequences of TRD, few studies also investigated its mechanism leading to the worsened survival outcome. Objectives: We aimed to illustrate the antidepressant treatment pathway from incident depression to TRD, and examine the association between TRD and all-cause mortality and its mediating mechanism. Methods: This was a population-based retrospective cohort study using territory-wide electronic medical records in the public healthcare setting of Hong Kong. Incident depression patients diagnosed in 2014 were followed up from the first diagnosis to death or December 2019 for TRD identification, which was defined as having taken at least two regimens of antidepressants for a defined duration and a third regimen to confirm previous treatment failures. We matched the TRD cohort 1:4 to the non-TRD cohort on propensity scores estimated by age, sex, history of physical disorders, and history of psychiatric conditions before depression diagnoses. Index dates were the prescription dates of the third regimen for TRD group, whilst the same index dates were assigned for the matched non-TRD control. Study outcomes included a prescription trajectory, all-cause mortality, and the preceding mediators. Results: 18% of incident patients developed TRD within six years of follow-up. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were the most common as first-line antidepressant therapy and treatment options varied greatly thereafter. Cox model showed that patients with TRD had 1.52-fold (95% CI: 1.14-2.02) greater risk of all-cause mortality, compared with non-TRD patients. Path analysis using structural equation modeling suggested that psychiatric conditions onset after TRD significantly mediated 41.6% of the mortality in patients with TRD (p ,"" 0.003). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the hard-to-treat nature of managing TRD from its complex treatment pathway. Identifying patients with TRD and subsequent monitoring for post-TRD psychiatric diagnoses, particularly self-harm, psychosis and schizophrenia, could be a way to improve survivorship.""",1.0,,True

Objectives: To estimate incidence rates (IRs) of first SPMs in r/r B-cell NHL and r/r MM patients overall and in select subgroups of interest using the Cancer Analysis System (CAS), a population-level database that collects data on cancer registrations for nearly all cancer patients in England. Methods: Patients were included in the study if they were diagnosed with incident B-cell NHL or MM during 2013-2018; and had evidence of r/r disease, defined as the initiation of a second line of therapy (LoT), identified using a LoT algorithm, during 2013-2019. IRs of first SPMs in r/r B-cell NHL and r/r MM patients were calculated per 1000 person-years at risk (PYAR), starting at date of r/r disease, and stratified by age at r/r disease, sex, ethnicity, year of initial B-cell NHL or MM diagnosis, and type of SPM (e.g., solid, hematological). Preliminary results are rounded per masking requirements. Results: Of the eligible incident patients identified, there were 9440 B-cell NHL patients and 4780 MM patients identified as having r/r disease by the LoT algorithm. Median age at r/r disease was 68 (NHL) and 69 (MM) years; patients were primarily white (À90%) and male (À60%), with a median (IQR) follow-up time of 18 (6-31) months for r/r NHL patients and 16 (830) months for r/r MM patients. Approximately 5% of r/r NHL and r/r MM patients developed at least one SPM on or after the r/r disease date. The overall IR of first SPM was approximately 40 (95% CI: 30-40) and 20 (95% CI: 20-30) per 1000 PYAR in r/r NHL and r/r MM patients, respectively . The rate of SPMs increased with age at r/r disease in both cohorts. Patients who had their initial NHL or MM diagnosis in earlier years had a higher rate of SPMs than those diagnosed more recently. Approximately 32% of r/r NHL and 42% of r/r MM patients who had an SPM after developing r/r disease were diagnosed with a solid tumor. Conclusions: These results suggest that the incidence of SPM among patients with r/r B-cell NHL or r/r MM is low and increases with age at r/r disease, and that most SPMs are not solid tumors.

Methods: All patients that receive clozapine from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must be registered with the VA National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC). A retrospective review and analysis of each patient's clozapine history was conducted using information from VA databases that collect prescription history, including clozapine as a registered patient. The databases identify patients that may be due for an update in extending monitoring intervals based on the following parameters: o Active in the NCCC database o Received any outpatient clozapine prescription in the last 56 days of No evidence of benign ethnic neutropenia, in hospice, or on chemotherapy o Registered with the NCCC between 6 and 24 months prior to review date o Currently receiving 7 or 14 day monitoring Following identification of patients that were possibly eligible for an extension in their monitoring interval, NCCC staff e-mailed prescribers to notify them of the patient's eligibility. Patient records were reviewed 6-months after the evaluation to identify if monitoring intervals had been extended. A cost-benefit analysis will be performed to assess the transition to an automated evaluation and intervention, in place of a manual process. Results: A total of 133 patients were identified for review. Nineteen (14.3%) patients were identified as eligible for extending the monitoring interval.

Of the patients that were updated to an extended monitoring interval, 10 (62.5%) were updated within 28 days of e-mailing the physician. Conclusions: Most patients have the correct monitoring interval for clozapine lab monitoring.

Objectives: To describe AD and AP rates of prescriptions before and during pregnancy in the Netherlands. Methods: We conducted a retrospective drug prescription study using the pregnancy subset of the University Groningen IADB.nl community pharmacy database. The study population included all singleton pregnancies with a delivery date anywhere between Jan first, 2000 and Dec 3first, 2019. Drug prescription rates per 1000 pregnancies of AD or AP were assessed from 6 months before the theoretical conception date until the child's birthdate. Prescription rates for different exposure windows were compared between decade 1 (2000-2009) and decade 2 (2010-2019) using the X2 test (p < 0.05). A top-3 of the most prescribed AD or AP drugs during pregnancy was based on a total number of continued and initiated treatments. Results: The total AD and AP rates increased from 44.7 and 4.2 in decade 1 to 59.9 and 9.2 per 1000 pregnancies in decade 2 (both trends p < 0.05), respectively. Continuation rates of AD and AP prescriptions during pregnancy showed a significant increase per 1000 pregnancies in decade 2 compared to decade 1 for antidepressants (17.7 to 31.2) and antipsychotics (1.3 to 4.0). A significant increase in initiation rate was observed for AD only (5.2 to 9.4). AD discontinuation rates decreased from 21.8 to 19.0 whereas such rates for AP increased from 1.4 to 2.9 per 1000 pregnancies. Top-3 of AD during pregnancy were paroxetine, fluoxetine, and amitriptyline (decade 1) and citalopram, paroxetine, and sertraline (decade 2). For AP this was haloperidol, quetiapine, and risperidone (decade 1) and quetiapine, haloperidol, and olanzapine (decade 2). Conclusions: The continuation and initiation of AD during pregnancy increased significantly over the past two decades. AP during pregnancy also increased, mainly due to increased continuation rates. The most frequently prescribed AD during pregnancy in both decades were SSRIs. Regarding AP, it changed from typical (decade 1) to atypical APs (decade 2).",1.0,community,True

Effect of type of treatment and duration were also evaluated. Results: IR of IRFUD in the 12 267 patients analyzed was 1.8 new cases per 100 p-y of exposure. Baseline analysis showed higher frequencies of IRFUD for smokers, substance abusers, non-oncology indications and diagnosis of depression and anxiety, respect to nonIRFUD patients (Table 1). Significant differences were only observed for patients aged  80, being this subgroup less likely to develop IRFUD. In patients IRFUD diagnosed in the follow up, significant differences were identified for concomitant treatments with benzodiazepines, opioids and gabapentine/pregabalin. The risk increased with duration of IRF treatment, being the highest for treatments during 180 days and longer. Conclusions: Incidence of IRFUD is difficult to compare.

Results: Twenty-eight studies across 14 countries in LMICs were included representing 4434 patients (mean age ranging from 47.4 to 59.5 years, 57.7% female). There were single-component and multiple-component interventions, which varied on many key aspects such as frequency of interventions and follow-up time. Face-to-face counseling was the most common intervention used, which was often combined with providing printed materials, remote consultations, or medication reviews. Most studies found improvements in the intervention group for most outcomes, including clinical outcomes (HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, lipid profile, body mass index), patient-reported outcomes (quality of life, medication adherence, diabetes knowledge, patients' satisfaction), and medication safety (identifying and resolving drug-related problems and adverse drug event).

Results: The DID increased 25% from 9.8 in the first quarter 2008 to 12.3 in the last quarter 2019 (pre-pandemic period). The increase was more pronounced in the first segment of the study period, increasing 17% from 2008 to early 2013 and 6% from late 2013 to the last quarter 2019. The CQGR throughout the entire period was 0.5%. A 2% increase was observed from the start of the pandemic (first quarter 2020) to second quarter 2021, being the CQGR 0.3%. During 2020, strong fluctuations in DID were observed with DID higher but also lower than the expected according to the ARIMA and ETS forecasting. An upward trend was observed from 2021 to the end of the study period, in which the actual DID observed was slightly higher (5%) than the DID expected and estimated from the ARIMA and ETS models. Conclusions: The observed data during 2020 might provide biased comparisons with the expected values estimated from the models, since measures were put in place in Spain to ensure availability of treatment, particularly in chronic ill patients, that allowed for stockpiling of medicines during the confinement, which might explain up and down fluctuations during this period. From 2021, the observed values are slightly higher than expected; nevertheless, the short period considered for this comparison might be underpowered to draw firm conclusions in relation to the hypothesis of an upward trend on antipsychotics use due to the pandemic´s impact.",1.0,pandemic,True

5584,"Background: Persistence and adherence to antidiabetic treatments are especially important to maintain glycemic control and prevent complications in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. Objectives: This study aimed to determine the persistence and adherence to antidiabetic treatments in Indonesian Health-Social Security Administrative Body (BPJS-Kesehatan) participants, based on antidiabetic types and classes, and the patient's age, gender, and comorbidities. Methods: This study used a retrospective cohort design using data sources from medical records of back-referral program for DM patients who were BPJS Kesehatan participants at a primary care clinic in Banjarmasin during 2020. Persistence was calculated by measuring the gap between prescriptions with a 14 days cutoff, while adherence was calculated with the Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) formula. The persistence data were analyzed using survival analysis. The adherence data were analyzed using the One-Way Anova, Mann-Whitney, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: A total of 77 DM patients were included, with most of the patients were < 60 years old (66.2%), males (66.2%), had comorbidities (71.4%), taken oral antidiabetic drugs (90.9%), with the most antidiabetic drug used were biguanide monotherapy (24.7%) and a combination of oral antidiabetics or a combination of oral and injected antidiabetics (58.4%). There were 67.5% DM patients who were not persistent to therapy (median of persistence of 210 days, 95% CI 171.17-248.83), but they had a good adherence (MPR value of 81.49 ± 16, 69%). There were no significant differences in medication persistence and adherence between categories of therapeutic types and classes, age, gender, and comorbidities (p > 0.05). Conclusions: It can be concluded that the adherence to antidiabetic treatments in BPJS-Kesehatan participants in a primary care clinic in Banjarmasin was good, but the persistence was poor, and there were no differences in adherence and persistence to treatments based on the therapeutic types and classes, and patient characteristics. An effort to investigate other factors that might affect the antidiabetic drug persistence would improve the treatment of these DM patients.",1.0,Social,True

5591,"Background: The burden of mental disorders is increasing worldwide. Psychotropic medicines are commonly used to treat these conditions, but their use is less frequent in vulnerable settings. Objectives: To assess the prevalence of psychotropic and antidepressant use and associated factors in two periods. Methods: This is an analysis of two cross-sectional studies conducted in Manaus in 2015 and 2019. Adults (18 years) were selected by a three-phase probabilistic sampling at home. The primary outcome was the prevalence of psychotropic use in the previous 15 days; psychotropic medicines were considered if the reported medicines belonged to the Anatomical Therapeutic Classifications N02A, N03, N04, N05 and N06 (including N06A: antidepressants). Poisson regression with robust variance was used to obtain the prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A subgroup analysis of antidepressants was also conducted. All analyzes were conducted with Stata 14.2 and considered the complex sampling design. Results: In total, 5800 participants were included (3479 in 2015 and 2321 in 2019). Psychotropic drugs were used by 2.03% of participants in 2015 and 2.66% in 2019. Antidepressant use increased from 0.4% (2015) to 1.4% (2019). In both surveys, antidepressants, antiepileptics, and antipsychotics were the most used drugs. The use of psychotropic drugs was lower in younger (PR ,"" 0.41; 95% CI 0.19-0.90), partnerless (PR "","" 0.64; 95% CI 0.44-0.93), and informal workers (PR "","" 0.47; 95% CI 0.25-0.86), but higher in people with poor health (PR "","" 2.86; 95% CI 1.71-4.80), who visited the doctor (PR "", 3.04; 95% CI 1.45- 6.38) and the dentist (PR ,"" 1.50; 95% CI 1.08-2.10), and with multimorbidity (PR "", 3.24; 95% CI 1.875.60).

5595,"have been largely promoted in France to reduce HIV incidence in high-risk populations. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the roll-out of PrEP use in France from its implementation up to mid-2021. Methods: Using the French National Health Data System (SNDS) covering 99% of the French population, all PrEP users as defined by individuals aged 15 years or older who received at least one dispensing of TDF-FTC for PrEP between 1 January 2016 and 30 June 2021 were identified. Numbers of incident and prevalent PrEP users and their sociodemographic and PrEP management (PrEP consumption, PrEP prescribers) characteristics were assessed over the study period. Results: As of 30 June 2021, a total of 42 159 individuals had initiated PrEP in France. Monthly PrEP initiations increased steadily up to 1 027 in February 2020, and then slowed down sharply from the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic until a recovery in the first semester 2021. During the first semester 2021, 26 812 people used PrEP, of whom 6 610 (24.7%) were PrEP initiators and 20 202 (75.3%) were prevalent users. PrEP users were overwhelmingly men (97.5%), aged 36 years on average, living in a large metropolitan area (73.8%), and among whom a minority (7.0%) were socio-economically disadvantaged. Throughout the study period, 80%-90% of users renewed PrEP from one semester to another, suggesting a good level of treatment maintenance. Nevertheless, PrEP consumption was low (median of 3 renewals in the first 6 months following initiation), suggesting sporadic or interrupted use in a substantial proportion of users. Private practitioners accounted for a minority (21.3%) of PrEP renewal prescriptions. Conclusions: Although PrEP roll-out has been substantial among MSM in France, further actions are needed to expand access to PrEP to all other groups of the population who could benefit from it, including women, socioeconomically-deprived people and those living in remote areas, and to promote adherence to treatment.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Patients with ACEIs-related adverse drug reaction (ADR) often have their treatment interrupted and their medication adherence impaired. These patients might be at the increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD) event and all-cause mortality. Objectives: To investigate the risk of subsequent CVD events and allcause mortality in patients with ACEIs-related ADR consultations in primary care and examine treatment pattern changes following the ACEIs-related ADR . Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study among ACEIs users between 2004-2019 using the IQVIA Medical Research Data. Patients with ACEIs-related ADR consultation in primary care (exposure group) were matched (1:1) using propensity scores to ACEIs users without ADR consultations (comparator group) based on demographics, comorbidities, and concomitant medication. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to compare the risk of CVD events and all-cause mortality, stratified by history of CVD. Treatment pattern changes within one year period following the ACEI-related ADR were subsequently examined. Results: Among 1 284 819 ACEIs users, 9144 (0.71%) had an ACEIsrelated ADR consultation in primary care. The mean (SD) follow-up time was 6.62 ± 3.91 and 5.94 ± 3.81 years for the primary and secondary prevention cohorts, respectively.

5637,"Background: In the Netherlands general practitioners (GPs) are responsible for primary type 2 diabetes (T2D)-care. To improve the quality of care, the Diabetes Care System (DCS) was set up in the West-Friesland region of the Netherlands. The DCS-center was responsible for the quality of T2D-care and performed centrally organized, annual, standardized assessments. In 2014 saving measures in DCS were introduced. Objectives: To compare diabetes care outcomes between patients treated in DCS and those in regular T2D-care in 2013. Methods: A retrospective observational study was performed in the DIAbetes MANagement and Treatment (DIAMANT) cohort, a population-based, dynamic, prospective cohort of persons with diabetes, derived from electronic medical records from Dutch GPs from the PHARMO Database Network. Data from 2013 were extracted. Logistic regression analysis was performed to compare medication use between the DCS-group (cases) and the regular T2D-care group (controls); negative binomial regression to compare the number of examinations per year, and multivariable ordinal logistic regression to compare proportions on target for glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and normal renal function. Results: 131 154 patients were included in the DIAMANT-cohort in 2013, of whom 7593 were treated in DCS. Age, age-at-diagnosis, and sex were similar between groups. DCS-cases were less likely to use the newer glucose-lowering drugs dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4)-inhibitors (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.21- 0.32) and glucose-like peptide-1 (GLP1)-receptor antagonists (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.25-1.34) compared to controls. Also the total number of glucose-lowering drugs used was lower in DCS-cases (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.82-0.90). The number of examinations (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.84-0.87) and GP-consults (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.91-0.94) was lower in DCS-cases. Furthermore, the use of antihypertensives (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.29-0.49), RAAS-agents (0.76, 95% CI 0.73-0.80) and calcium channel blockers (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77-0.87) was lower in DCS-cases, whereas the use of diuretics, beta blockers and lipid-modifying drugs was similar between the two groups. HbA1c-levels in DCS-cases compared to controls were lower (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.71); the proportion of patients on target for HbA1c was similar in both groups, as was the proportion with normal renal function.",1.0,case,True

We determined the prevalence of antihyperglycemic prescriptions for agents approved for use in dialysis-dependent kidney disease alone and in combination with insulin. Additionally, we characterized antihyperglycemic users in October 2017. Results: Among the 129 865 hemodialysis patients with comorbid diabetes, insulin was the most prescribed agent (33%), followed by sulfonylureas (SU, 7%), DPP4 inhibitors (DPP4i, 5%), and thiazolidinediones (1%) in October 2017. SU use fell, and DPP4i use rose from 2012 to 2017. Less than 5% of the total population received combination therapy of insulin plus a second agent. In 2013, 2.3% of the patients were prescribed insulin plus SU, and 0.9% were prescribed insulin plus DPP4i. Conversely, in 2017, insulin plus DPP4i was more commonly prescribed (insulin + DPP4i: 1.6% vs. insulin + SU: 1.4%). Disregarding kidney disease as an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factor, 65% of patients met American Diabetes Association ASCVD criteria, and 96% were at high risk for ASCVD. GLP-1 RAs were prescribed to less than 1% of patients. Twenty percent of individuals prescribed GLP-1 RAs had an endocrinology claim in the prior 6 months, compared to 10% of the total population of individuals with comorbid diabetes treated with hemodialysis. Conclusions: GLP-1 RA use by hemodialysis patients is limited. There is compelling need to establish the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 RAs in this high-risk population.

Within each pre-diagnosis trajectory group we used GBTM, accounting for non-random dropout due to death, to further cluster patients based on post-diagnosis opioid use. We describe use in each trajectory in terms of oral morphine equivalents (OMEs). Results: Among the 41 976 people dispensed opioids prior to diagnosis, 6 distinct opioid use trajectories were identified: 1) high OMEs (7%); 2) mid OMEs (8%); 3) steadily increasing OMEs (4%); 4) late OME increase (20%); 5) low OMEs, increasing (36%); and 6) low OMEs, decreasing (25%). Pre-diagnosis opioid treatment in all groups was primarily comprised of weak opioids. All groups experienced an increase in dispensed OMEs during the month of cancer diagnosis, with the largest increases occuringin groups 3 and 4. GBTM identified 4-5 post-diagnosis trajectory groups within each pre-diagnosis trajectory group. Post-diagnosis trajectories varied considerably by prediagnosis trajectory. Broadly, people in the `high' and `mid' groups retained similar levels of pre-diagnosis use; those in all other groups had increases during the month of diagnosis, but heterogeneous trajectories thereafter. Post-diagnosis opioid treatment was primarily comprised of strong opioids in all groups. Conclusions: There is substantial heterogeneity in opioid use prior to cancer diagnosis, which may influence long-term patterns of postcancer opioid treatment.

Globalization of manufacturing has resulted in centralization of supply chains that is vulnerable to disruptions. A recall of valsartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), in July 2018 due to the contamination with a probable carcinogen illustrates the global nature of supply chains. Yet, the global impact of the valsartan shortage on the overall use of antihypertensives has not been studied. Objectives: To examine the effects of the global valsartan recall and shortage on the utilization trends of antihypertensive medication in 83 countries. Methods: A cross-sectional, time-series analysis of the global sales of antihypertensive medications across 83 countries from Jan 2017 to July 2020 was conducted using the IQVIA MIDAS Database. The total retail and hospital-based wholesale purchases of valsartan, nonvalsartan ARBS and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were studied in a global context and by economic development status. The 1-, 3-, 6-month percent changes in monthly valsartan purchases for each country from July-December 2017 to the same period in 2018 were also quantified and analyzed. Results: Overall, total monthly global purchases of valsartan significantly decreased by 17.9% from July to August 2018 and 13.2% between August 2017 and 2018 following the recall. The purchases of non-valsartan ARBs increased by 12.2% from July to August 2018 and 28.9% between August 2017 to 2018. Of the 32 developed countries, 20 (62.5%) showed a decline in 1 month (July-Aug) percent change in valsartan sales between 2017 and 2018, whereas only 10 out of 33 developing countries (30.3%) had decreased valsartan purchases after the valsartan recall.

Objectives: Recently, a decrease in prescribing of NSAIDs was observed in the Netherlands, but whether a similar decreasing trend could be observed in the incidence of severe UGIB (either fatal or requiring hospitalization), contingent on medication prescription, is unknown. Methods: We conducted a cohort study using Dutch national statistics on pharmacy claims, hospitalization and mortality between 2013 and 2018. We explored the annual and biannual incidence of sex- and age-specific severe UGIB in four (sub)populations: A) total population, B) without filled NSAIDs prescriptions, C) without filled NSAIDs and antithrombotic agents, D) without any risk factors for UGIB. Next we compared the incidences by means of logistic regression where the calendar year of 2013 was considered a reference. Finally, we compared the risk of severe UGIB between women and men in different age groups and the proposed (sub)populations. Results: The cumulative incidence of severe UGIB did not decrease throughout the study period, regardless of the subgroup analysis. In the total population, it was 199 per 100 000 inhabitants [95% confidence interval (CI), 197-201] in 2013-2014 and 260 [95% CI, 258- 263] in 2017-2018.

Psychopathology was common among young melatonin users with 75% registered with either a psychiatric disorder diagnosis (54%), a filled prescription for another psychotropic (58%), or a contact to a private practice psychiatrist (15%) within ±12 months of melatonin initiation. General practitioners prescribed melatonin to almost half of all new users (48%) while psychiatric specialists accounted for 37%. Conclusions: The incidence of melatonin use increased in Denmark from 2012-2019. A substantial proportion of melatonin users had concurrent psychopathology most likely explaining their use of melatonin. Long-term melatonin use was more common among the youngest age groups, which should be a focus of interest due to limited safety data.",1.0,contact,True

5692,"Background: Topical ophthalmic medications commonly treat eye conditions across all age spectrums; however, types of topical ophthalmic medications and their indications for use may vary dramatically by age. Understanding the extent to which these medications are used can provide a crucial foundation for research on their safety, especially in older adults who are more susceptible to adverse events in general. Objectives: To provide an epidemiologic evaluation of topical ophthalmic prescription utilization within a large segment of the US privately insured population. Methods: We used IBM® MarketScan® Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Claims databases (IBM Corp) data from January 2005 to December 2019 for analyzes. Topical ophthalmologic prescriptions were identified from pharmacy dispensing claims based on route of administration. Patients were required to have 28 days of continuous insurance and prescription drug coverage in a month to contribute to monthly prescription prevalence estimates. Population-based prevalence estimates of topical ophthalmologic prescriptions were calculated relative to person-time of the full population and stratified by age. We also compared the individual medication entities (to account for each component of combination medications) and stratified by therapeutic class. Results: Topical ophthalmic prescriptions comprised 0.77% of all prescription fills in patients aged < 18 and 9.8% of all prescriptions filled in patients aged 80 years. Patients aged 80 years were the highest utilizers of topical ophthalmic medications, with 23.4% receiving at least one prescription per year and a mean of 1.2 prescriptions per person-year for the full population. The most commonly used therapeutic class among patients < 18 old was anti-infectives, comprising 84.8% of unique medication entities. However, glaucoma medications were the predominant type of topical ophthalmic medication entities filled among patients aged 80, comprising 66.8% of unique prescriptions medications followed by anti-infectives comprising 17.0%. Conclusions: Overall, topical ophthalmic medication utilization was highest in older adults. This epidemiological evaluation provides further insight into topical ophthalmic prescription utilization and can serve as the foundation for further research on safety using real-world data.",0.0,,False
5693,"assess racial/ethnic disparities in pain treatment especially in older adults among whom cancer is the most prevalent. Objectives: To describe the patterns and temporal trends of racial/ ethnic disparities in use of pharmacologic (opioid and nonopioid) and nonpharmacologic pain treatment among cancer patients (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, uterine, head and neck). Methods: An incident cancer diagnosis cohort was created from the 2007-2016 SEER-Medicare claims linked dataset - a large, population-based dataset for older (65 years old) cancer patients. Follow-up for the incidence (first time receipt with no prior use) of use of pain treatment commenced on the date of cancer diagnosis through to the 365th date post diagnosis - patients who died within this period were excluded. Poisson regression was used to calculate the adjusted-cumulative incidence rates (aIR) of pain treatment adjusted by age, sex, year of diagnosis and cancer type. Joinpoint regression was used to measure: 1) the average annual percent change (AAPC) which is a single summary of the average trend of race-by-sex agestandardized IR; and 2) racial disparities - measured as the absolute difference (AD) in AAPCs between each minority group (non-Hispanic Black [nHB], Hispanic-Latino [LatinX], Asian/Pacific Islander [API], Others) vs. non-Hispanic Whites (nHW) (referent). Results: Our analysis involved 471 378 cancer patients - nHW (73.6%), BAA (9.9%), Hispanic (8.6%), Asian (6.6%), Other (1.3%). Overall, opioids were the most frequently used pain treatment with the highest and lowest use observed among LatinX (aIR , 64.5%) and Others (aIR , 51.1%). nHW (aIR ,"" 15.6%) were significantly most likely to use nonpharmacologic treatment compared to the rest. Over time, the rate of opioid use was relatively higher among nHBs (AD "","" 0.4%, P < 0.001) and LatinX (AD "","" 0.7%, P < 0.001) but lower among Others (AD "","" 1.5%, P < 0.001), compared to nHWs. The trends of non-opioid use among nHBs (AD "","" 1.8%, P < 0.001) rose higher than among nHWs. No other disparities in pharmacologic treatment were observed.

Methods: We conducted a descriptive analysis of serial cross-sectional data using the IQVIA National Disease and Therapeutic Index (NDTI), a nationally representative audit of ambulatory physician practices in the United States. We focused on visits for type 2 diabetes among patients over the age of 35 in which one or more drugs were prescribed (""treatment visits""). We assessed prescribing of insulin for type 2 diabetes, both overall and aggregated by insulin molecule, delivery devices, therapeutic class, insulin type, and date of approval. Results: The total number of insulin treatment visits declined from a peak of 6.0 million visits in 2016 to a nadir of 4.9 million visits in 2020 (approximately 18% decline). Among all insulin treatment visits in 2020, 1 989 154 (43.9%) were among those aged 60 to 74 years; 2 372 629 (52.4%) among men; 2 646 247 (58.4%) among White patients; 811 639 (17.9%) among Black patients; and 701 912 (15.5%) among Hispanic patients. Insulin glargine was used in almost half of treatment visits from 2016 to 2020 (eg, 2020: 2.6 of 4.9 million visits; 95% CI, 2.1-3.1 million). Among insulin classes, long-acting insulin accounted for approximately twothirds of treatment visits during this period (eg, 2020: 3.7 million visits; 95% CI, 3.0-4.4 million). Treatment visits for insulin pens increased from 36.1% in 2016 (2.2 of 6.0 million visits; 95% CI, 1.7-2.7 million) to 58.7% in 2020 (2.9 million visits; 95% CI, 2.3- 3.5 million), while use of insulin vials/syringes declined in parallel. Analog insulin use predominated and accounted for more than 80% of total treatment visits across all years (eg, 2020: 4.3 million visits; 95% CI, 3.4-5.1 million). Newer insulins were increasingly used, from 18.1% of total treatment visits in 2016 (1.1 million visits; 95% CI, 0.8-1.4 million) to 40.9% in 2020 (2.0 million visits; 95% CI, 1.5-2.5 million). The use of biosimilar insulin, which was first approved in 2015, increased from 2.6% in 2017 (0.1 of 5.3 million visits; 95% CI, 0.04-0.2 million) to 8.2% in 2020 (0.4 million visits; 95% CI, 0.2-0.6 million) of total insulin treatment visits.

5704,"Objectives: To evaluate BPH treatment pattern (duration, switch and discontinuation) utilizing National Health Insurance Bigdata in South Korea Methods: Claims data (2009-2019) was obtained from National Health Insurance Bigdata to establish a retrospective cohort. The study population was 40 years or older males with the first BPH diagnosis made between 2011 and 2013, who initiated AB or 5ARI within 30 days after the diagnosis. Included patients were classified into 5 groups as AB monotherapy, 5ARI monotherapy, AB and 5ARI dual therapy, two ABs dual therapy, and other combinations of AB and 5ARI drugs. We followed patients up to 6 years until discontinuation to look for a change in drug regimen from one to another group. Discontinuation was defined by no prescription record for 90 days after the last date that the last prescription covered. We calculated ""treatment duration"" by the sum of days covered by individual prescriptions until discontinuation. Resumption was defined by the presence of a prescription record qualifying an inclusion for any of the 5 drug groups after discontinuation. For the patients who had treatment switched at least once, we analyzed the distribution of drug groups before and after the switch. Results: A total of 460 895 patients with a mean age of 62.1 were included in the analysis. The most prevalent drug regimen as the initial therapy was AB monotherapy (N , 290 569; 63.0%) followed by AB and 5ARI dual therapy (N ,"" 114 009; 24.7%), and 5ARI monotherapy (N "", 43 560; 9.5%). Most patients in the 5ARI monotherapy continued the initial treatment without switching (N ,"" 34 903; 80.13%) but the mean treatment duration was the lowest (116.3 ± 239.5days) among the 3 prevalent drug regimens. The mean treatment duration was 298.3 for AB monotherapy and 336.6 days for AB and 5ARI dual therapy. The treatment duration tended to increase as the number of switch increased, regardless of the initial treatment type. For patients who switched drug regimens, AB monotherapy or AB and 5ARI dual therapy were the two most prevalent regimens which patients switched to, indicating patients continued to use AB intermittently with or without 5ARI throughout BPH management. The overall resumption rate was 43.1%. Conclusions: The results suggest that patients tend to utilize AB with or without 5ARI predominantly and intermittently. The clinical consequences of early discontinuation or intermittent use of the first line BPH drugs should be investigated in future research to optimize BPH management in the real world.""",1.0,clinical,True

We examined primary non-adherence in a national rheumatology EHR data warehouse linked to pharmacy claims data. Objectives: To examine primary non-adherence of autoimmune medications in a national rheumatology EHR data warehouse linked to pharmacy claims data. Methods: We identified new users of TNFi and non-TNFi biologics, conventional and targeted synthetic DMARDs used for rheumatoid, psoriatic, or spondyloarthritis in the Illumination Health Real-World Evidence Platform linked to fee-for-service Medicare or commercial health plan claims data. Patients with new prescriptions identified in the EHR data were compared to the gold standard of actual fills or administrations in linked claims data at 3 and 6 months. We examined factors associated with non-adherence using KM curves and estimated hazard ratios (HRs) from Cox proportional hazards models, comparing oral and subcutaneous (SQ) medications to intravenous TNFi (TNF-IV). Results: In Medicare, 858 patients were prescribed 1097 immunomodulatory medications, with mean (SD) age 67 (11) years. Similarly, 395 commercially-insured patients initiated 522 medications, mean (SD) age 63(13) years. Approximately 60% had RA. The most common newly prescribed medications were csDMARDs(Medicare: 51%; commercial: 51%), TNFi (Medicare: 15%; commercial: 16%), non-TNFi biologics (Medicare: 21%; commercial: 21%), and Janus kinase inhibitors [JAKi] (Medicare: 13%; commercial: 12%). Following the first prescription in the EHR data and within the next 3 months, patients frequently did not fill the prescribed medication (Medicare: 37%; commercial: 46%) or any new immumomodulatory medication (Medicare: 25%; commercial: 38%). Results were minimally better at 6 months for the prescribed medication (Medicare: 36%; commercial: 43%) or any new medication (Medicare: 22%; commercial: 36%). After multivariable adjustment, and referent to TNFi-IV, medication class was significantly associated with primary non-adherence (Medicare: TNFi-SQ HR: 2.1, 95% CI 1.25-3.3; non-TNFi IV: HR 3.6, 2.1-5.9; non-TNFi SQ: HR 3.8, 2.3-6.7; tsDMARDs: HR 3.8, 2.3-6.3; csDMARDs: HR 1.1, 0.7-1.7; commercial: TNFi-SQ HR: 0.8, 95% CI 0.3-2.1; non-TNFi IV: HR 1.3, 0.4-4.1; non-TNFi SQ: HR 2.6, 1.0-7.1; tsDMARDs: HR 1.0, 0.4-2.6; csDMARDs: HR 0.4, 0.2-1.0). Conclusions: Patients with RA, PsA, or SpA frequently did not fill newly prescribed biologics and immunomodulatory medications prescribed by their rheumatologist.

Group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) is being widely used as a method to characterize the dynamic pattern of real-world medication adherence over time and can provide a better understanding of patient journey throughout their treatment course. Objectives: To explore the use of GBTM in the identification of clusters or groups of patients with similar patterns of medication refill behavior among novel oral anticoagulant (NOACs) users. Methods: Retrospective, multicenter cohort study (Phollow cohort) of adult patients taking NOACs (ATC: B01AA03, B01AA07, B01AE07, B01AF01, B01AF02 and B01AF03). Patients were recruited from Portuguese community pharmacies (CP). Medication refill data was retrieved through the dispense pharmacy records for 3 years prior to the recruitment date. Adherence was defined as the proportion of days covered (PDC) and evaluated for a period of 2 years. GBTM was used to identify groups of distinct patterns of adherence. Results: About the sample, 66.6% were male and 79.4% were aged 65 years or older. Overall, mean PDC rate at 1-year was 70.8.% and at 2-year was 73.6%. Patients were categorized in four different trajectories: the majority were adherent (61.7%), followed by gradual decline (19.3%), gaps in adherence (13.3%) and rapid decline (5.8%). Average probability of group membership was higher or equal to 93%. Conclusions: Clinically relevant adherence trajectories (patterns) were identified among NOAC users. The identification of different trajectories on the adherence pattern can help to improve strategies for interventions in therapeutic management leading better outcome results on adherence, especially in patients with low-adherence trajectories.

Methods: Analyzes were based on cross-sectional data from the first 3000 participants of the Rhineland Study, a population-based cohort in Bonn, Germany, including people aged 30 years. Medication data were collected interview-based. We assessed the prevalence and determinants of untreated hypothyroidism in LT4 non-users with binomial logistic models. We assessed treatment status in LT4 users by TSH levels (controlled 0.56-4.27 mU/l; overtreated < 0.56 mU/l; undertreated >4.27 mU/l) and quantified their determinants (e.g. demographics/ comorbidities) in multinomial logistic regression models (reference group: controlled). Subsequently, controlled individuals were grouped into tertiles (low-normal, normal, and high-normal TSH) and the same methods were applied to assess determinants. Results: The analytical sample comprised 2938 individuals (mean age 55 years, standard deviation (SD) 14.4, range 30-95; 57% women), of whom 23% reported LT4 use. 78% were classified as controlled, 18% as over-, and 4% as undertreated. In non-users of LT4, the odds of hypothyroidism were lower in men (odds ratio (OR) 0.52 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.290.92) than in women and lower in those with self-reported depression (OR 0.19 95% CI 0.030.61) than in those without depression. Increasing BMI (OR 1.09 CI 95% CI 1.03-1.14) resulted in higher odds of hypothyroidism. Among LT4 users, older age (OR 1.03 95% CI 1.01- 1.08) was associated with higher odds of overtreatment. Higher LT4 dose was associated with higher odds of both over- (OR 1.02 95% CI 1.02-1.03) and undertreatment (OR 1.02 95% CI 1.00-1.03). Mean TSH in controlled users was 1.6 mU/l (SD 0.8). In controlled users, lower odds of low-normal TSH were observed in men (OR 0.51 95% CI 0.26-1.00) compared to women and iodine supplement users were more likely than non-users to have low-normal TSH (OR 1.80 95% CI 1.04-3.11). Individuals in the low-normal (OR 0.52 95% CI 0.30-0.90) and high-normal (OR 0.48 95% CI 0.26-0.90) ranges were more likely to have poorer cognitive performance. With increasing age, the likelihood of having a highnormal TSH level decreased (OR 0.96 95% CI 0.93-0.99). Conclusions: LT4 use is suboptimal in our population: 22% are inadequately treated, resulting in high absolute numbers. There seems to be a tendency to treat towards lower levels of TSH (overtreatment), which is noteworthy in that lower TSH levels, even in the normal range, are associated with negative health outcomes.",1.0,negative,True

5728,"Methods: This is a cross-sectional, web-based study conducted all over Norway in June 2019-June 2020. Women who were currently pregnant and had been offered antidepressants in the last 5 years could participate. This study applies a mix-method approach to examine decision-making perspectives among women considering antidepressant medication use in pregnancy and the postpartum period. In a sample of women, we characterized pregnant and postpartum women in relation to key variables such as sociodemographic and clinical features. Further, we conducted four focus groups with pregnant and postpartum women with moderate to high decision-making difficulty to explore the considerations and support needs of these women. Thematic networks as an analytical tool for qualitative analysis was used. Results: 276 women participated. Pregnant women with high decisional conflict (DC) (n ,"" 125) were older, had higher education and were more often employed, more often nulliparous, more often had a psychiatric illness and fewer users of antidepressants than women with low DC (n "", 47). Similar characteristics were seen in postpartum women with high DC (n , 75) with the exception of age and history of psychiatric illness; low DC women (n ,"" 29) were older with a higher prevalence of psychiatric illness. Findings from the focus groups showed enablers in decision-making regarding AD use such as regular discussions and proper communication with healthcare providers and follow-ups; fear of postpartum depression and disease severity and unfamiliarity with the potential risks of the medication. Barriers in decision-making regarding AD use included concerns regarding mother and fetal health, difficulty in access to urgent help & referrals, diverging recommendations by the healthcare providers and a plethora of online resources and inadequately informed decision-making. Conclusions: The difficulty in the decision-making seems to be driven by gaps in knowledge about antidepressant use during and after pregnancy, concerns about the health of the mother and child, and disease severity and unfamiliarity with the potential risks of the medication. Due to a plethora of online resources, it is difficult to get the right help and information.

Data analysis was presented as frequencies and percentages. Results: Patients above 60 years were 34 (18.7%). There were equal number of males and females, 91 (50%). Maximum patients were from the surgery ward 38 (20.8%) followed by Obstetrics and Gynecology and Plastic Surgery wards 25 (13.5%) each. Only one antibiotic was used in 81 patients (44.5%) followed by two antibiotics in 71 (39%) patients. Duration of antibiotic prophylactic use was one day in 66 (63.7%) patients. Culture was done for 67 samples. Blood, urine, sputum, and wound swabs were the common samples. The culture result was positive for 17 (24.7%) samples. The common organisms isolated were E. Coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Ceftriaxone was the most used antibiotic. Cephalosporins, 71 (38.6%) were the commonest group of antibiotics, followed by fluroquinolones, 28 (15.3%). Drug and therapeutics and infection control committees, and pharmacovigilance activities were present in 3/6 (50%) study sites. Antimicrobial stewardship was present in 3/6 (50%) and microbiological services in all hospitals. Antibiotic formulary and antibiotic guideline was present in 4/6 sites, and facilities audited or reviewed surgical antibiotic prophylaxis choice in 2/6 (33.3%) sites, facility to monitor antibiotic use was present in 4/6 (66.6%) and cumulative antibiotic susceptibility reports in 2/6 (33.3%) sites. Conclusions: Not all parameters for infrastructure, policy and practice and monitoring and feedback were present in the study sites. PPS studies should be done periodically to study AMR and monitor the impact of antimicrobial stewardship and infection control programs.

5735,"Background: Opioid analgesia has an important role in treating cancer pain but can place survivors at risk for long-term adverse effects, including misuse, abuse, and overdose. Opioid use has been studied in surgical oncology patients, but little is known about long-term use and outcomes for patients with hematologic malignancies who primarily receive non-surgical treatment. Objectives: To evaluate the association between opioid use during lymphoma treatment and persistent opioid use. Methods: We conducted a cohort study using IBM Watson Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Data from 2000- 2019, containing claims for employer-sponsored privately insured individuals in the US. We identified opioid-naïve adults age 18-64 years at first diagnosis of Hodgkin (HL) or Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who had outpatient cancer therapy lasting 90-240 days (including 3 episodes of outpatient chemotherapy). Using outpatient pharmacy claims, we categorized each patient's opioid exposure during cancer treatment as no exposure, moderate [1-7 days supply], or high [>7 days supply]. Follow-up began 60 days after final cancer treatment and continued up to 365 days or until an outcome or censoring event. Persistent opioid use was defined as 120 days cumulative supply, 3 consecutive months of opioid prescriptions, or a prescription with 90 morphine milligram equivalents per day. We used time-to-event methods to estimate cumulative incidence and hazard ratios across exposure groups. Results: The cohort included 4380 opioid-naïve lymphoma patients. 42.5% had HL and 57.5% had NHL. Median age at diagnosis was 46 years (IQR 32-56) and median treatment duration was 147 days (IQR 112-166). 55.0% of patients were male. During cancer treatment, 42.8% of patients had no opioid exposure, 28.1% had moderate, and 29.1% had high exposure. Among the no-opioid-exposure group, the 1-year cumulative incidence of persistent opioid use was 1.7%. Compared to this no-exposure group, hazard ratios for moderate and high exposure were 2.6 (95% CI 1.5-4.6) and 9.0 (95% CI 5.6-14.4), respectively, after adjustment for cancer treatment duration, age, cancer type, and calendar time. A sensitivity analysis comparing patients diagnosed 2000-2009 vs. 2010-2019 found that hazard ratios were consistent between the two time periods, but that absolute risks of long-term opioid use declined significantly over time. Conclusions: Higher opioid exposure during cancer treatment was associated with higher risk of persistent opioid use in the year following cancer treatment. The absolute incidence of opioid use decreased over time and may be due to increased awareness of the opioid epidemic. Close clinical follow-up in the post-treatment period may be warranted for patients at high risk of adverse outcomes.",1.0,epidemic,True

5744,"Background: Up to 80% of chronically ill patients experience drug related problems (DRPs). These impact patient's health and increase health care cost. Mentalizing refers to understanding one's own and others' feelings and thoughts. Training pharmacy staff in patientcentered communication using the mentalizing concept may establish a trustful relationship with the patient and as a result improve early identification of drug related problems. Objectives: To explore the effects of an innovative mentalizing training course on the frequency and type of drug related problems identified by pharmacy staff. Methods: This was a multicenter uncontrolled pre and post intervention study performed in Danish and Dutch community pharmacies. Participating pharmacy staff was extensively trained for four months. The main outcome was the frequency of DRPs. For identifying and classifying DRPS the DOCUMENT classification system was used. Pharmacy staff recorded all DRPs they identified during face-to-face conversations at the pharmacy counter for six hours both prior to and after the course. A mixed multilevel logistic regression model was used to assess the difference in detected DPRs. Results: A total of 41 pharmacy staff members (25 in Denmark and 16 in the Netherlands) participated in the study. 1667 and 840 conversations were recorded in Denmark and the Netherlands, respectively. The percentage of conversations where drug related problems were identified changed from 17.5% to 19.0% in Denmark and from 17.4% to 28.0% in the Netherlands. The difference between the countries was not significant (p ,"" 0.244). In total, a DRP was recognized in 22.1% of the counter conversations after the course, compared to 17.5 before. This increase of 28% was not significant (p "","" 0.086). In first prescriptions, the chance for recognizing a DRP was twice as high as with a repeat prescription (OR 2.12, p"",""<0.001). In most cases, the information obtained in the conversation with the patient was the trigger. Recognized DRPs were often resolved by providing information. In Denmark, referring to other healthcare providers decreased after the course. Conclusions: Pharmacy staff identified drug related problems in about 1 in 5 conversations after the training. Although the overall increase of detected DRPs was not significant, the increase in number of the DRPs in the Netherlands and the shift of recognized DRPs in Denmark seem promising effects of the training in mentalizing.""",1.0,community,True

Objectives: To examine trends in buprenorphine use among between January 1, 2020 and November 17, 2020 in the US, and evaluate the differential impact of COVID-19 across states these patterns overall and by prescriber (e.g., nurse practitioner) and prescription (e.g., > 21 days' supply) characteristics. Methods: Using retail pharmacy dispensing claims from the IQVIA Longitudinal Prescription (LRx) we identified individuals that filled a buprenorphine prescription at a retail or mail-order pharmacy every week between January 1, 2020, and November 17, 2020. We report weekly rates of buprenorphine use per 10 000 persons ages >18 years nationally and for each state. Using interrupted time-series analysis, we examined whether there was a change in level or rate of growth of buprenorphine users during the COVID-19 pandemic. January 1, 2020-March 4 2020 was defined as the pre-pandemic period and March 18-November 17, 2020 as the pandemic period. Results: Among adults ages  18 years, the weekly rate of buprenorphine per 10 000 population (per-capita) increased by 9.2% from 9.9 (n ,"" 253 967) the week of January first, 2020 to 10.8 (n "","" 277 425) by November 17, 2020 in the US These weekly rates, however, varied substantially across states, ranging from < 5 per-capita (Texas, California, Iowa) to >50 per-capita (Vermont, Kentucky, West Virginia) in January 2020. In aggregate, we found a statistically significant decline in the level of buprenorphine use the week of March 25, 2020 (0.47, CI, À0.90 to -0.04) yet no significant change in the weekly growth rates between the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. We observed a differential impact of COVID-19 on buprenorphine use by state; declines in both level (À11.12, CI, À13.64, À8.60)) and growth rate relative to the pre-COVID period (À0.31, CI, À0.56, À0.06) were most pronounced in Vermont. Decreases in level (À5.64, 95% CI, À8.68, À2.59), but increases in the total growth rate (0.21, CI, 0.09, 0.33) were most pronounced in West Virginia. The share of NP prescribers increased (20.0% vs. 23.6%) as did the share of buprenorphine prescriptions >21 days' supply (42% vs. 38%) during the pandemic. Conclusions: Buprenorphine use has not changed significantly since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 at the nationallevel with several states experiencing substantial declines and other substantial increases.

5754,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic led to rapid uptake of virtual modalities for delivering healthcare, even among vulnerable groups such as older adults with dementia, who have more barriers to accessing technology yet have greater health needs. However, the impact of rapid virtualization on prescriptions is unknown. Some early evidence has suggested the potential for overprescribing, while others have raised concerns of the potential for treatment disruptions and non-adherence among those most vulnerable. Objectives: To compare the volumes of prescriptions and other healthcare service use, and average costs between high and low users of virtual care with dementia before and during the pandemic. Methods: We conducted a population-based, weekly cross-sectional study from January 2018 to March 2021 using administrative data from Ontario, Canada. All residents aged 65+ with valid healthcare coverage and a diagnosis of dementia were included. Patients were categorized as high users of virtual care if they attended two or more virtual visits during the pandemic, while low users attended none or one virtual visit. We compared total and new prescriptions between high and low users. Secondary outcomes included the number of hospitalizations, emergency department visits, outpatient visits, and laboratory testing, and mean costs per patient. Results: The average weekly number of total prescriptions decreased steadily from pre-pandemic to during in low virtual care users (96 185 to 38 944, or À60%), while numbers continuously increased in high users even during the pandemic (95 730 to 115 032, or +20%). Similarly, the number of new prescriptions decreased in low users (3410 to 935, or À73%), but remained stable throughout in high users (3338 to 3396, or +2%). Both low and high users experienced notable reductions in hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and lab tests due to the pandemic, but only high users returned to pre-pandemic levels. In contrast, the pandemic did not affect outpatient visit trends in high users, with volumes continuing to increase (19 093 to 21 108, or +11%), while low users saw a decrease. Mean costs per patient were stable but surprisingly greater among low users than high users prepandemic. Both groups saw an immediate reduction in costs when the pandemic began, however only high users rose to pre-pandemic trends (low: 430 to 229, or À47% vs high: 221 to 305, or +38%). Conclusions: Use of prescriptions and other healthcare services were mostly unaffected by the pandemic among high virtual care users. This suggests that virtual care helped dementia patients maintain access to care during times of physical distancing, while those who did not access virtual care may have been less ill or had unmet needs for care during this time.",1.0,COVID-19,True

5758,"Background: Over the past five years, studies consistently revealed an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer in association with hydrochlorothiazide (HCT). Swissmedic issued a direct healthcare professional communication (DHPC) on November 18 2018. Objectives: To evaluate the association between the DHPC and the use of HCT and other first-line antihypertensives in Switzerland. Methods: We performed an interrupted time series analysis using claims data from the Swiss health insurance `Helsana' between January 1 2014 and February 28 2020. Within monthly intervals (30 days), we quantified the total dispensed defined daily doses (DDD) per 10'000 insured individuals of preparations containing 1) HCT, 2) ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ACEI / ARB), 3) calcium-channel blockers (dihydropyridine-type, CCB) and 4) thiazide-like diuretics (bendroflumethiazide not on Swiss market). We conducted segmented linear regression (adjusted for seasonality) to quantify the average number and the trend of monthly dispensed DDD per 10'000 individuals prior to the DHPC, as well as the immediate change (four months lag period) and the slope change over time after the DHPC. Results: We identified a yearly average of 1'121'043 insured individuals during the study period. We observed an average number of dispensed DDD of HCT of 11'713 / 10'000 prior to the DHPC, which was already declining (trend ,"" - 26.6 DDD/10'000 per month, p < 0.0001). The DHPC was associated with an immediate 5.9% decline in the number of dispensed DDD of HCT (- 692.5 DDD/10'000, p "", 0.007) and a slope change of - 79.8 DDD/10'000 per month (p ,"" 0.0046). The average number of dispensed DDD (60'822/10'000) of ACEI / ARB increased prior to the DHPC (104.8 DDD/10'000 per month, p < 0.0001), but the DHPC was not associated with a significant immediate effect (À2'324, p "","" 0.0962) or slope change (À101.8, p "", 0.5019).

Conclusions: Between 2014 and end of February 2020, the use of HCT (in DDD) decreased by 31%. The DHPC was associated with a moderate immediate and prolonged accelerated decline in the use of HCT in Switzerland. Due to the lack of bendroflumethiazide, this decrease appears to be mainly compensated by a 6.6% increase in ACEI / ARB, the most frequently used antihypertensives. Use of CCB increased by 22%, although at a third of the use volume of ACEI / ARB. The DHPC per se was not associated with a change in trend of the use of ACEI / ARB and CCB.""",1.0,flu,True

5764,"Background: Policies to address opioid-related harms include strategies to reduce opioid prescribing for new and ongoing pain management. Concerns have been raised that people with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) may be adversely affected by prescribing restrictions, and by involuntary tapering and cessation of opioids. Objectives: To describe self-reported challenges obtaining prescription opioids among people prescribed opioids long-term for CNCP and explore associations with participant and treatment characteristics. Methods: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from a longitudinal cohort study of 1514 Australians prescribed restricted opioids for CNCP. In 2018, 861 participants who took part in Year-5 follow-up and reported past 12-month opioid use were asked about challenges obtaining opioid prescriptions, including prescriber access-related difficulties obtaining prescriptions or having opioids tapered or ceased involuntarily. Associations between challenges and demographics, treatment characteristics including daily opioid dose as oral morphine equivalent milligrams (OME mg/day), substance use disorder (SUD), and opioid dependence were assessed using logistic regression. Results: Overall, 285 (31%) participants reported at least one challenge, predominantly prescriber access-related difficulties (n ,"" 177/285; 62%). Prescriber access-related difficulties were associated with younger age (adjustedOR 0.94 per year increase, 95% CI 0.93-0.96), and past 12-month pharmaceutical opioid dependence (adjustedOR 2.25, 95% CI 1.33-3.80). Involuntary opioid tapering or cessation was reported by 73 participants (26% of those reporting challenges) and was associated with lifetime SUD diagnosis (adjustedOR 2.15, 95% CI 1.153.90), and opioid doses of 200 OME mg/day (adjustedOR 2.41, 95% CI 1.18-4.88). Conclusions: One-third of participants with CNCP reported experiencing challenges obtaining prescriptions for opioids or having their opioid medicines involuntarily reduced within a 12-month period. Given increasing restrictions to opioid access, it is important that strategies to reduce opioid-related harms are balanced against the current treatment needs of people prescribed opioids long-term for CNCP.""",0.0,,False

Real-world data on their use in girls/women of childbearing age are scarce. Objectives: To assess trends in the use of FGL and TFL in girls/women of childbearing age, characterize users and estimate the number of pregnancies occurring under treatment with FGL or TFL in Germany. Methods: Using the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD, claims data from ~20% of the German population), we conducted cross-sectional analyzes among girls/women aged 13-49 years to determine age-standardized prevalences of FGL and TFL use for each year until 2018 (numerator: girls/women with 1 dispensation in the respective year; denominator: mid-year population). We characterized users with regard to their age and the specialty of the prescribing physician. Furthermore, we conducted a cohort analysis to determine the number of pregnancies occurring during FGL/TFL treatment. For that purpose, we assigned an exposure window to each dispensation (date of dispensation + number of dispensed defined daily doses) and assessed whether it overlapped with the onset of pregnancy. This study was financed by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM). Results: We identified 3684 and 2057 girls/women with 1 dispensation of FGL (2011-2018) and TFL (2013-2018), respectively. For FGL, the age-standardized prevalence of use per 1000 females increased from 0.14 in 2011 to 0.48 in 2018; for TFL, it increased from 0.06 in 2013 to 0.27 in 2018. About 60% of FGL users and about 45% of TFL users were 40 years of age. 85% of FGL dispensings and 87% of TFL dispensings were prescribed by neurologists. Overall, we identified 74 pregnancies exposed to FGL and 15 pregnancies exposed to TFL at the onset of pregnancy. For FGL, the number of exposed pregnancies increased to 116 when the exposure window was extended by two months to take into account the delayed elimination of FGL. Conclusions: Use of FGL and TFL among women of childbearing age has substantially increased in Germany since their authorization.

The cohort is US enrollees 2-64 years old with any mental health care in 2019 or 2020, continuously enrolled in both years, and no telepsychiatry use in 2019. We classified psychotropic medications into therapeutic classes using the American Hospital Formulary System. The dependent variables were binary indicators (1/0) for psychotropic use, overall and for each therapeutic class (i.e., stimulants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers) in 2020. Telepsychiatry use in 2020, defined by the number of visits (i.e., 0, 1, 2-3, 4-9, 10), was the independent variable. Current Procedure Terminology and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes identified telepsychiatry. We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for psychotropic use among those who used telepsychiatry services relative to those who did not, adjusting for baseline mental health services, psychiatric diagnoses, age, gender, and type of health insurance coverage. Results: The cohort included 47 233 enrollees, with 17% being 2- 17 years old and 59% female. In 2020, 62% used any psychotropic medication, 46% of which used antidepressants. Among those with mental health care in 2020, 55% transitioned to telepsychiatry. In 2020, relative to in-person care, those with telepsychiatry care were more likely to use psychotropic medication (1 visit OR 2.0, CI 1.8, 2.1; 2-3 visits OR: 1.7, CI 1.8, 2.1, and 4-9 visits OR 1.1, CI 1.0, 1.2). Those with >10 telepsychiatry visits had a lower odds of psychotropic use than those who received in-person care (OR 0.9, CI 0.8, 0.9). These results were robust in the subgroup analysis by age (i.e., 2- 17 years and 18 to 64 years). Conclusions: Individuals with fewer telepsychiatry visits in 2020 were more likely to use psychotropic medication. The inverse relationship warrants further investigation to explore confounding by severity in the association between telepsychiatry services and psychotropic medication use.",0.0,,False

Polydrug use - alcohol or illegal drugs - was also analyzed. Using sales data from Health Market Research Portugal, medicine utilization-based death rates and the relationship between the number of deaths and psychoactive medicines' exposure were investigated. Results: The rate of deaths involving at least one psychoactive medicine (N ,"" 7653) among all violent or ignored cause deaths, has decreased from 2014 to 2016, but increased in 2017 and 2018, reaching 26.7% in 2018 (17.4 deaths/100 000 inhabitan ts), 71.1% of which unintentional. The number of benzodiazepines involved in fatal cases has decreased, from 1361 in 2014 to 1160 in 2018; prescription opioids (strong and weak) show an opposite trend (64;132 to 151; 218 positive toxicology reports), as well as antidepressants (548 to 710). In 4.8% of studied deaths, the autopsy confirmed the medicine's contribution to the fatal outcome. In 20% of deaths there was polydrug use, 14.2% with alcohol (75% males; 28% older than 65 years) and 4.2% with illegal drugs (N "","" 323, 78% males), of which 48% with cocaine and 58% with cannabis . Diazepam (N "","" 5810; 76%), tramadol (1493; 20%) and alprazolam (1262; 16%) were the active substances more frequently found in psychoactive medicine death cases, both with and without medicines' contribution. In 2018, midazolam, diazepam, fentanyl and tramadol had the highest utilization-based death rates (1194, 1028, 865 and 808 deaths/100 000 patients treated). A positive significant relationship between psychoactive medicine deaths and sales data was found (Spearman rs "","" 0.683; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our results, pointing to an increase in deaths involving psychoactive medicines in which 20% also involve other CNS-acting non-medicinal substances, highlight the importance of using medicine-related morbi-mortality data as a tool to monitor medicines' misuse and increase the safety of their use.""",1.0,case,True

About 40% of patients treated with antidepressants had been diagnosed with depression; however, only 17% of patients treated with the two most consumed benzodiazepines - alprazolam and diazepam - had an anxiety diagnosis. Conclusions: Psychoactive medicines are widely used in ARSLVT, especially by older females. Concomitant use of several psychoactive medicines is significant and may contribute to increased risks, a topic that is also being addressed in the MisuMedPT project.

The largest reductions occurred in CR oxycodone and naloxone (6146 OME/day, 95% CI [2496; 10 013]), IR paracetamol and codeine (5490 OME/day 95% CI [4612; 6309]), and IR tramadol (4047 OME/day, 95% CI [3789; 4290]). No significant changes in trend were detected when aggregating across IR formulations (14.8 OME/day^2, p,"".156), CR formulations (À10.1 OME/day^2, p"","".628), or overall (4.7 OME/day^2, p "","" 0.905). Conclusions: The introduction of half-pack sizes and tightened prescribing restrictions were associated with declines in both IR and CR opioid dispensings on the PBS. These findings align with the intent of the policy intervention, but it is not possible to determine if this represents a true reduction in Australian opioid use as patients may have accessed these medicines through the private market.""",0.0,,False

5831,"Background: Concerns over serious respiratory depression in children led to two European Union (EU) referral procedures (2013 and 2015) to review the benefit-risk balance of codeine in this population when used for pain relief, cough or cold. Codeine should no longer be used in children < 12 years and restrictions were introduced for treatment in children 12 years. Objectives: This multinational collaborative study aimed to assess the effectiveness of these risk minimization measures and to evaluate changes in prescribing of alternative treatments. Methods: Children under 12 and between 12 to 18 years were followed between 2010-2017 to analyze quarterly trends in prescribing of codeine and alternative treatments in electronic health records from France, Germany, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom using interrupted time series. Results: Overall prescribing of codeine in children decreased in all five countries, reaching extremely low prevalence in children under 12.

Conclusions: The decrease in use of codeine shows that healthcare professionals followed the adopted measures and switched prescribing patterns for pain management in children under 18 towards opioid or non-opioid analgesics depending on national clinical and reimbursement practices. Whist the magnitude differed between countries, the second referral on cough/cold had a minimal impact on the use of codeine and antitussives.",1.0,clinical,True

Objectives: To identify and quantify common drug combinations in first-time NIAD users with polypharmacy (5 co-prescribed drugs) after implementation of the updated 2015 NICE guideline in the UK, stratified by NIAD compound. Methods: New users of a NIAD aged 18+ were identified from the IQVIA Medical Research Data incorporating data from THIN, A Cegedim Database, between 2016 and 2019. The frequency and proportion of co-prescribed drugs were ranked by frequency of prescribing, stratified by the 5 most prescribed NIAD compounds. The apriori algorithm was applied to identify and quantify drug combinations of up to 7 drugs to investigate potential harmful polypharmacy patterns. Results: We identified 38 247 new users of NIADs, of which 22 903 had polypharmacy.

5846,"Background: Tapentadol is a -opioid agonist, moderate noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor and very weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It is less potent than most strong opioids but toxicity is yet to be fully understood. The sustained-release formulation, indicated for relief of chronic moderate to severe pain, was listed for government subsidy in Australia in June 2014. Changes to prescribing policies to support safe and appropriate opioid use in Australia were introduced in June 2020; the COVID-19 pandemic also impacted prescribing Behavior. Although sales of tapentadol have increased since its introduction to market, long-term patterns of utilization and the impact of these policy and practice changes have not been assessed. Objectives: To estimate trends in utilization and dispensing of publicly subsidized prescription tapentadol in Australia between 2014 and 2021. Methods: We used a 10% sample of the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dispensing data from 1 June 2014 to 31 December 2021. We assessed annual prevalence and incidence rates, dispensing patterns and characteristics of tapentadol initiators. Results: The number of monthly initiators increased steadily from September 2014 to a maximum of 1572 in November 2019, before decreasing by 31% to 1084 in December 2021. Total monthly dispensed prescriptions increased from June 2014 and plateaued from June 2020, coinciding with changes to opioid prescribing policies in Australia. The lowest strength formulations (50mg, 100mg) comprised nearly three quarters of all dispensed prescriptions. On average, fewer than 5% of dispensed prescriptions were for the strongest formulation (250mg). There were 69 795 tapentadol initiations between September 2014 and December 2020. The largest proportion of tapentadol initiations were among individuals aged 45-84 years (51 072; 73.2%) and among females (39 740; 56.9%). Despite the approved indication being for chronic pain and the supply covering two weeks at recommended doses, over half the patients (40 126; 57.5%) did not receive a second dispensing within 90 days of initiation. Conclusions: The overall patterns of tapentadol dispensing align with that of other opioids, although the drivers of the decrease in tapentadol initiations are unclear.

5853,"Background: Previous research has shown that individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and higher levels of polypharmacy may be at higher risk of depression relapse, whilst antidepressant treatment is maintained. However, there has been no research to the best of our knowledge that investigates the association between polypharmacy and depression relapse, after antidepressant treatment is discontinued, in individuals with T2DM. Objectives: In individuals with comorbid depression and T2DM, we aimed to investigate the association between restarting antidepressant treatment as a marker of depression relapse, and the number of concurrent medications prescribed at the time of prior antidepressant discontinuation. Methods: We performed a cohort study using UK primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in the years 2000-2018. Our cohort included participants with comorbid depression and T2DM, who had started antidepressant treatment for the first time during their electronic health record (EHR) follow-up, and subsequently discontinued treatment. Our outcome was restarting antidepressant treatment within the first year after prior antidepressant discontinuation. Antidepressant treatment was defined using prescriptions data. We used Cox regression models with penalized Bsplines to describe the association between restarting antidepressant treatment and the number of concurrent medications prescribed at the time of prior antidepressant discontinuation. Results: We identified 48 001 participants with comorbid depression and T2DM, who started and discontinued antidepressant treatment during their EHR follow-up. 35% of these participants restarted antidepressant treatment within one year following prior antidepressant discontinuation. As the number of concurrent medications prescribed at the time of prior antidepressant discontinuation increased, the rate of subsequently restarting antidepressant treatment also increased. The increase continued until participants were prescribed a maximum of 18 concurrent medications, where participants were more than twice as likely to restart antidepressant treatment (hazard ratio 2.148, 95% CIs 1.316-3.506).

5879,"Background: The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a standard measure of disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, its limited availability in most electronic health records or administrative claims databases significantly hinders the prospects of real-world evidence studies in MS. Objectives: To develop a linked database that combines the potentials of claims and registry data in MS, supplementing disease severity indicators such as the EDSS. Methods: We developed a retrospective linked database using the German AOK PLUS statutory health insurance fund and Multiple Sclerosis Management System 3D (MSDS 3D) registry from the Center of Clinical Neuroscience Dresden (ZKN). While AOK PLUS provides a record of all inpatient and outpatient diagnoses, treatment history, and healthcare resource use and costs, it lacks data on disease severity including EDSS. In contrast, ZKN holds a record of clinical factors such as MS clinical history and performance, including EDSS and functional system sub-scores. We recruited patients in MSDS 3D who were insured by AOK PLUS and had at least one EDSS assessment between 01/10/2015 and 30/06/2019. After obtaining informed consent, AOK PLUS received a list of pseudonymized registry IDs and insurance IDs.

At first EDSS assessment, functional system sub-scores were available for most patients: brainstem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel/bladder, and cerebral (99.0%), visual (98.0%), and ambulation (97.0%). Challenges during linkage included delays in patient recruitment and uneven distribution of EDSS scores in the sample, with 78.6% of all scores ranging from 1.5 to 4 and 2.3% from 7 to 10. Conclusions: A linked database combining claims and registry outcomes can provide complementary data to improve the capacity of real-world studies in MS, including the investigation of disease severity and progression, comparative effectiveness, and claims data-based proxy validation.",1.0,disease,True

5886,"Background: Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers researchers an opportunity to assist with evidence generation that use the literature for their foundational data. Examples include targeted literature reviews (TLRs), systematic review, as well as answering specific questions, such as finding point-estimates for modeling from literature. Objectives: To demonstrate two different TLR use cases where AI assisted in finding relevant literature in an efficient manner: #1- identifying all relevant studies, and #2 - extracting quantitative outcomes. Methods: We leveraged an existing AI system that uses PubMed as a data source.[1] In case #1, we performed a TLR on recurrent wheezing, and used AI to identify retrospective, real-world studies and their ICD coding schemes. In case #2, we used AI to ascertain outcomes of third-line treatment for gastric cancer. The AI allowed our epidemiologists to search for and filter all relevant PubMed articles using AIgenerated classifications of study methodology and AI extractions of results (e.g., interventions and outcomes). Results: Starting with 316 articles from search in case #1, the AI enabled us to filter to the papers that measured ""wheezing"" as an outcome, automatically separate retrospective from prospective studies, and detect real-world studies as separate from other study types. This yielded 159 articles for screening, automatically eliminating nearly 50% of the irrelevant articles that failed the inclusion criteria. For case #2, the search returned more than 600 papers, from which the AI allowed us to narrow down to 17 papers with results focusing on third-line therapies. In this case, we had a manually performed search to compare against and found that the majority of the articles were relevant, comparable to the previous experiments on this AI.1 Overall, we found relevant articles and categorized pertinent information efficiently with less time resource allocation compared with manual review and extraction. Conclusions: AI can help epidemiologists efficiently find useful articles to support rapid analytical workflows. Filtering based on AI-extracted results (e.g., outcomes or interventions) and methodology (e.g., study type) eliminates the need to review irrelevant articles. Future improvements of the AI platform could facilitate inclusion of (1) data sources outside of PubMed without extra steps to ingest the data (versus a human that can read anything), and (2) the ability to process languages other than English.

5890,"Background: Considerable cancer burdens are reported among Mongolian, the largest ethnic minority in East Asia (over 10 million population globally with 63% Chinese), who mainly reside in the inner Mongolia autonomous region (IM), China. However, few epidemiological studies or health interventions has been initiated to rectify the cancer health disparity. Objectives: To establish an ethnic-oriented dynamic cancer screening cohort, via integrating primarily collected data (risk assessments & screening tests) with electronic healthcare databases (EHD). Methods: Since Jan 2017, citizens aged 40-75 in 5 districts of 2 most populated cities in IM are conveniently sampled via freeof-charge attendance, social medium and recommendations. Information on sociodemographic and risk factors associated with targeted cancers (lung, breast, liver, upper gastrointestinal including esophageal and gastric, colorectal cancer [1]) was collected by paper-based risk assessment questionnaire. With an established risk score system, participants considered at high risk will undergo screening tests. Participants screened as negative will be followed actively by five-year annual screening and phone/inhouse visits. All participants in the cohort will be passively followed using EHD (claims, cancer registry, first page of medical records and death registry) to update their information on diagnosis, medications, cause of death, tumor onset, comorbidities, etc. Data linkage and integration is realized by personal identify number, which is de-identified during data analysis for privacy protection. Results: This project is ongoing with 70 010 valid baseline questionnaires. After de-duplication and verification, 69 590 eligible participants remain for data analysis (mean age ,"" 55.7 years, 53.7% female, 11.3% Mongolian and 86.2% general population interacting with Mongolian due to geographic subjection). 22.5%, 21.0%, 15.9%, 16.8%, 19.0%, 19.3% participants were considered at high risk in targeted cancer types [1]. By 2019, 365 new cases of all cancer types were captured in claims and cancer registry, and 59, 57, 18, 22, 19, 57 were diagnosed as targeted cancer types [1]. 414 752 prescriptions were captured in the claims, among the top 5 prevalent being solvents, Niuhuang Chinese medicine, aspirin, adrenal corticosteroids and proton pump inhibitors. Conclusions: Scan-China is a unique multi-source EHD platform to generalize epidemiological knowledge and popularize screening interventions on the Mongolian population. Though at the preliminary statistical stage, risk factors will be explored and validated using prediction models, as well as cancer-related comorbidities, complication, treatment patterns, drug efficacy and safety, etc will be studied in the future.""",1.0,social,True

5896,"Background: Large datasets of adverse drug effects (ADEs) typically attain their size by relying on automatic, or semi-automatic, methods for generation. Naturally, this often comes with a compromise on the precision of the generated data. Hence, one would like experts to curate such datasets, but this often grows costly and time consuming the larger the dataset is. Alternatively, laypersons with access to the internet may search for corroboration of listed ADEs, using resources such as Wikipedia. Importantly, Wikipedia integrates knowledge from numerous online resources, including commercial ones, like drugs.com. Objectives: Here we suggest automating this hypothetical curation process - that is, to augment the automatic extraction of ADEs by an automatic curation step based on the knowledge accumulated in Wikipedia. Methods: To curate a dataset of ADEs, we suggest retrieving the Wikipedia page associated with each drug, and checking whether its listed ADEs appear in the sections describing adverse effects. We further label ADEs as common or rare according to their frequency as indicated in the drug's Wikipedia page. Drug indications, typically described in the opening paragraph of the page, can be similarly identified, and then filtered out. Results: We use the suggested method to curate two large ADE datasets (SIDER and OFFSIDES) and compare the ""distilled"" results to two small, handcrafted ADE datasets, which we consider as the ""gold standard"". We show that the distilled datasets have a much higher precision relative to their originating ones, suggesting that the corroborations automatically found in Wikipedia indeed tend to highlight ADEs of interest. Conclusions: Algorithms, which aim to infer drug-ADE relations - for example, from electronic health records (EHRs) - should at the very least be able to identify the ""clear cut"" cases. Moreover, in many contexts it is unrealistic for them to correctly identify rare ADEs, and trying to do so may lead to inaccurate conclusions about their quality. The high-precision benchmark constructed herein may therefore be a valuable resource for the evaluation of such algorithms. Methodologically, the task of identifying the adverse effects of drugs and vaccines from EHRs are essentially the same, and so this benchmark could be useful in calibrating and evaluating algorithms designed with both goals in mind. A similar approach may be applied to related tasks, such as identifying drug contraindications.",1.0,case,True

5899,"Background: The needs of Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) cancer survivors diagnosed between 15-39 are inadequately met by current care systems. Objectives: This project was to stratify unmet need risks associated with clinical or non-clinical factors to supportive services. Methods: Setting: Using administrative claims and national health behavior survey (BRFSS) datasets, cancer survivors (n ,"" 7288) of three age-specific groups including adolescent (15-18), emerging (19- 25), and young adults (26-39) were compared. Exposures or interventions: Unmet needs were measured for those who did not receive any cancer care summaries compared to their counterparts. Main outcome measures: Five unmet needs contexts including physical, mental, accessible, developmental, and behavioral health were compared between unmet versus met groups. Statistical analysis: Descriptive and hierarchical clustering were performed to identify unmet risks and their patterns. Results: The unmet AYA survivors show a 2.8 times higher unemployment rate (7.60% vs. 2.70%) compared to adult survivors. In fact, they described not being able to work due to cancer (13.40% vs. 5.80%). Our findings highlight social health determinants as potential factors which include low income (less than $15 000), ethnic minority (nonWhite), and rural residency (not in MSA). Low-income related risks were observed as the greatest gap and rurality related risks were observed in the adolescent group in comparison to the other AYA groups. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings identified high risks of psychosocial unmet needs and reproductive concerns in clinical unmet needs. Ultimately, this project expects to determine how perceived risks with relevance to high unmet demands may vary over the course of survivorship. Predicting unmet patterns of referred supportive services could determine optimal strategy to reinforce local cancer care needs.""",1.0,clinical,True

Measuring engagement with technology is critical to understand its potential uses in monitoring response to psychotropics. Objectives: To assess differences in engagement with a mobile app (MindPWR) and a wearable sleep and activity tracker, between adolescents with mood disorders taking antidepressants (mood) and those without mood disorders (controls). Methods: In this mixed-methods prospective, pilot study, adolescents (12-17y) were recruited from child psychiatry clinics, primary care practices, and community organizations to trial the first prototype of the MindPWR app. MindPWR is an app that assesses changes in mood, sleep, and fatigue through PROMIS measures administered every other day as Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA). Eligible participants completed a baseline assessment, downloaded the MindPWR app, and used a wearable tracker 24/7 for 4 weeks. Engagement was defined as 1) proportion of participants responding to >50% of EMA over the 4-week period and 2) proportion of days the activity tracker was used during daytime or night time, estimated as days of use over total days in the study (n ,"" 28). We report overall percentages and percent differences in engagement with the MindPWR app and wearable, between adolescents in the mood and control groups. Qualitative interviews were conducted at the end of follow up, to assess challenges with technology engagement. Results: A total of 20 adolescents (10 controls, 10 mood) participated in the pilot, 55% females, mean age 15 years. A higher proportion of the controls relative to the mood group were engaged with both morning (80% vs 10%, respectively) and evening (100% vs 10%, respectively) EMAs. Engagement with the wearable tracker was 17% higher among controls, during the daytime and 19% higher during the night time, compared to the mood group. Adolescents in the mood group reported the app was easy to use, but noted challenges remembering to complete EMA despite the automatic notifications. Level of comfort with the wearable, especially at night, was described as a factor limiting its use.

5910,"Background: Medical product safety studies traditionally use condition-specific diagnosis codes as filters to identify patients with health outcomes of interest, but such filters may lack sensitivity. Objectives: We sought to identify five types of electronic health record (EHR) data (coded procedures, labs, medications, problem lists, and diagnoses; hereafter called features) as surrogates for diagnosis codes used in traditional filters. With COVID-19 disease as a use case, we evaluated whether such surrogates improved sensitivity by identifying COVID-19 cases overlooked by a traditional filter. Methods: Using EHR data from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) from 4/2020- 3/2021 we identified a cohort of potential COVID-19 cases using six COVID-19-specific diagnosis codes as a traditional filter. We noted all other EHR features appearing in close proximity to their COVID19-coded encounters. For each such feature we calculated a metric indicating how much more often the feature co-occurred with COVID-19-coded encounters compared to encounters of patients never receiving COVID-19 diagnoses. For example, the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) procedure was 40.8 times more likely in COVID-19-coded VUMC encounters. A clinical domain expert reviewed all features that were at least 10 times more common in COVID-19 encounters and retained those with clinical face validity. We used retained features to create five ""high-sensitivity"" filters, one per data type, and applied them to all patients not identified by the traditional filter. We used manual chart review of random samples to estimate true cases of COVID-19 with at least moderate symptoms and, separately, at least mild symptoms. Results: The traditional filter identified 20 951 VUMC and 6847 KPWA potential cases; the five high-sensitivity filters added 4566 (VUMC, +21.8%) and 1482 (KPWA, +21.6%) potential cases. Estimated true case rates for potential cases at VUMC by the traditional filter were 51% and 90% (respectively, for at least moderate and at least mild symptom severity); corresponding rates at KPWA were 34% and 71%. Estimated truecase rates for potential cases by the high-sensitivity filter at VUMC were 6.4% and 55% (respectively, for at least moderate and at least mild symptoms); corresponding true case rates at KPWA were 13% and 38%. Importantly, the high-sensitivity filters increased true case sensitivity at VUMC by 2.7% and 13.2% (moderate, mild) and at KPWA by 7.9% and 9.8% (moderate, mild). Conclusions: This high-sensitivity filter approach can improve the sensitivity of traditional filters, is largely automated, and may generalize to other health outcomes.",1.0,COVID-19,True

5916,"Background: Multinational studies can be performed across a distributed network of data sources by converting the original data into a common data model (CDM), and then running a common analysis script at each site. Multiple CDMs have been successfully deployed, but analysis scripts designed to run against one CDM cannot directly work for another CDM. It is therefore useful to develop scripts that can support multiple CDMs. In a past study, the analytic pipelines of multiple CDMs, including OMOP and Sentinel, were conceptually mapped to a sequence of transformation steps: (T1) conversion to the CDM, resulting in a CDM instance; (T2) study variable creation, resulting in datasets of observations on the study population: this is the first step of a study script; (T3) application of study design, resulting in analytic datasets; and (T4) statistical analysis, resulting in datasets of study results. In practice, scripts can be structured according to this sequence of steps. In such scripts, step T2 alone needs adaptation to the different CDMs Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility of retrieving quantitative metadata (age and sex distribution) from data sources mapped to different CDMs Methods: In the European project MINERVA, we simulated a data source with sex and dates of birth and data source entry and exit. We converted the data source to 4 commonly used CDMs: OMOP, ConcePTION, Nordic and TheShinISS and developed an R analysis script to calculate annual sex and age distributions of the population. Four versions of step T2 were programmed, one per CDM, to generate the same output. The next steps (T3 and T4) were designed to run on the output of T2, and were programmed just once. The script was run against the 4 conversions of the simulated data source, and the resulting 4 outputs were merged, to test whether they were the same. Finally, the script was run against two real instances of CPRD and ARS, converted, respectively, to the ConcePTION and TheShinISS CDM. Results: The script took a few hours to develop and is loaded in a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ARS-toscana/MINERVA_ samplescript). The 4 runs in the simulated data source resulted in generation of the same output dataset (distributions). The script ran successfully against the two data sources and correctly calculated their annual age and sex distribution. Conclusions: It is possible to structure study scripts in a common sequence of steps. This minimizes the effort to adapt them to multiple CDMs, because one step only (T2) requires adaptation. Structuring scripts this way has the potential to support collaboration in studies, by enabling the use of multiple CDMs.",0.0,,False

Understanding and addressing the emotional implications on voluntary reporting of medication errors will not only improve the Quality of reporting but also patient safety itself. Objectives: To study the barriers and facilitators in reporting medication errors among the nursing staff. Methods: A descriptive, questionnaire (validated) based study was carried out in a teaching hospital of developing country. The nursing staff were approached and the aim of the survey was explained. The google form was created with the validated questions and the link was shared with the nursing staff. The questionnaire consisted of a section about the background information and qualifications, eight items on barriers to reporting, and five items on facilitators of reporting an error. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the collected data. The data is presented categorically and represented as n (%). Results: A total of 398 nurses responded to the study, of which 346 (86.93%) were females and 52 (13.06%) were males. The majority [118 (29.64%)] had 5-10 years of nursing experience. The most significant barriers to medication error reporting, according to nurses, are prioritizing reporting only serious errors [241 (60.55%)], a lack of peer support [74 (18.59%)], and fear of consequences after reporting an error [64 (16.08%)]. Other barriers identified were lack of trust in the reporting system [57 (14.32%)]; the process of reporting an error is time-consuming [66 (16.58%)]. The study participants acknowledged that professional encouragement [307 (77.13%)] was the major facilitating factor for reporting an error. Also, developing a feedback mechanism for the reported errors that focuses on the system and not on any individuals [302 (75.87%)], a ""no-blame"" culture [291 (73.11%)], and support and encouragement from the multi-disciplinary team [272 (68.34%)] are the other facilitating factors identified. Conclusions: It is important to create a consistent environment for nurses to feel safe and confident reporting medication errors without fearing the consequences. Adopting an one to one counseling with systematic approach to medication error reporting, improves the quality of medication error reporting rates and patient safety.

Objectives: The main objective was to distribute COVID-19 vaccine doses efficiently and equitably to all sites that need it while staying compliant with Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and VA Central Office (VACO) reporting requirements. Methods: Available software such as Microsoft InfoPath and PowerApps were used as a front-end tool for facilities to register, receive, and track vaccine. Developed tools were used to collect the necessary information that was requested by the CDC to register facilities and contacts, request new vaccine orders, and track both waste and daily on-hand inventory. Cloud services such as Microsoft PowerAutomate were used to automate workflow management of newly submitted data along with email confirmation and permission controls. Microsoft PowerShell scripts were then developed to efficiently move data to a Structured Language Query (SQL) and translate the information into an export file per the CDC specification requirements. These data were also analyzed to identify discrepancies and ensure data are accurately entered. Summary of these data as well as quality assurance data have been made available to VA staff by utilizing a national PowerBI report. Results: From 12/16/2020-2/23/2022, 532 facilities (VA medical centers and several CBOCs) have reported storing doses on hand and added 3370 contacts.

5930,"Methods: Five (5) Phase II clinical trials have been selected to utilize data tokenization via a token algorithm software to assess the available data sources to be linked to existing patient information collected in the trials. Most token algorithms utilize complete personal identifiable information (PII) including first/last name, date of birth, gender, and address (including zip code). As such, local legal and data privacy considerations must be identified and carefully evaluated. By implementing a token identification (ID) algorithm, PII is transformed into an unrecognizable token ID that is not linkable to the patient. The data token process and assessment has been initiated in two (2) of the five (5) clinical trials, focusing on a central nervous system (CNS) disorder and on a chronic disease (CD). As global regulations vary around the collection of PII, only the CNS trial (US only) contained all required PII elements while the CD trial (global in X countries) only contained the patient's email address. Key to the analysis will be determining the number and type of PII required to maximize the utility of a token algorithm. Results: Of the 38 patients currently enrolled in the CNS trial to date, all required PII data elements have been available and utilized. To date, the CD clinical trial has enrolled 33 patients with the availability of an email address for all participants. The analysis will provide findings from both clinical trials in terms of the availability of PII and percent linkable with other real-world data sources.

5941,"Objectives: To discuss the challenges encountered and lessons learned in conducting a validation study of safety outcomes from a post-approval investigation using routinely collected data in health databases from five countries: Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States of America. Methods: We requested medical records from all primary lung cancer patients initiating crizotinib and a randomly selected subset of primary lung cancer patients initiating ceritinib, erlotinib, or gefitinib treatment. Independent CT-based case definitions for each safety outcome were used to inform the data abstracted from these routine medical records. The abstracted data for each safety outcome were reviewed by two specialist adjudicators. We then calculated the positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity of the algorithms used to identify the safety outcomes. Results: We requested data for 749 patients but obtained completed data abstraction results for 540 patients. There was a wide range in PPVs (range: 0.00-1.00), NPVs (0.17-1.00), and sensitivity estimates (0.00 À1.00), both within each outcome by country and between the different outcomes overall; however, ranges for specificity estimates were narrower (0.81-1.00). Conclusions: The main lesson learned was the challenge of adapting CT-based case definitions in studies that obtain information from routine medical records: CT-based case definitions assume close patient follow-up, including the identification of clinical event manifestations and sub-clinical signs. Moreover, future researchers must consider medical chart access issues, differences between database mechanisms that affect the types of recorded information, and the nature of the conditions of interest (as rare events may be more difficult to validate).",1.0,case,True

Methods: We applied the ONTARGET trial eligibility criteria in CPRD to select prevalent users of an ACEI/ARB between 1/1/2001-31/7/2019 to develop a trial-analogous cohort. We used propensity score weighting and adjustment of imbalanced variables to address confounding and compared treatment effects observed from a time-to-event analysis in our trial-analogous cohort with those obtained in the trial, for the trial primary composite outcome of cardiovascular related death, myocardial infarction, stroke and hospitalization for heart failure. We used a pre-specified validation criteria of HR between 0.9-1.12 and CI containing 1.

Results: In a propensity-score-weighted analysis of the trialanalogous CPRD cohort (ACEI: 96 602, ARB: 40 553), for ARB vs ACEI we observed a HR 0.97 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.01) for the trial primary outcome, which met our pre-specified criteria for similarity to the ONTARGET result HR 1.01 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.09).

Methods: Data were simulated to create a complete population of 100 patients similar to the gMG registry. Missingness of diagnosis date was simulated assuming that older dates were more likely to be missing day and month: 30%-50% missing below the 25th percentile, 25%-30% missing in the 25th to 75th percentile and 5%-15% missing above the 75th percentile. Each simulation was performed 100 times and summary statistics were calculated for those with complete data, and again with imputation of missing month and day to July 1 of the year of diagnosis. The % difference in averages of descriptive statistics were compared to summary statistics for the original simulated population with complete data. Results were also compared to findings from the gMG registry. Results: In the simulated complete population, mean ± standard deviation (SD) disease duration from diagnosis to treatment was 4.16 ± 5.96 years. Under the conditions of nonrandom missingness using complete case analysis, estimates of mean bias for time from diagnosis to treatment initiation ranged from À8.6% to À18.2% across the scenarios evaluated. A greater percentage of missingness in older dates was associated with a larger magnitude of bias. Imputation for month and day of year reduced the mean bias to < 1%. The patterns observed in simulated data were similar to those observed from the gMG registry, where the mean ± SD time from diagnosis to treatment using a complete case approach was 2.7 years ± 4.64; n , 43 but with imputation increased to 5.5 years ± 8.95; n ,"" 63.

Adult males diagnosed with PC (defined by 2 or more ICD-9:185. or ICD-10:C61. codes on separate dates) between 2012-2017 who had chart review data available were included. The study population was comprised of men with varying risk for metastases, including men treated with therapies only approved for metastatic or castration resistant PC (n ,"" 134), men with castration sensitive (CS) PC with PSA 20 ng/ml (n "","" 299), and men with CSPC with PSA < 20 ng/ml (n "","" 289); both groups of CSPC men did not receive therapy beyond ADT and/or primary therapy. Two algorithms were used to identify mPC: 1) ICD-9/10 codes for secondary malignant neoplasms (ICD-alone) and 2) ICD-9/10 codes and/or common mPC treatments (ICD + treatment). Using chart review as the gold standard, sensitivity and specificity were calculated for ICDalone and ICD + treatment algorithms. The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were estimated across a range of potential mPC prevalence. Results: Of 722 men with PC, 177 were classified as mPC from chart review compared to 174 by the ICD-alone and 203 by the ICD + treatment algorithms. Sensitivity and specificity for the ICD-alone algorithm were 72.9 (95% confidence interval: 65.7-79.3) and 91.7 (89.1-93.9), respectively; for the ICD + treatment algorithm they were 80.2 (73.6-85.8) and 88.8 (85.9, 91.3), respectively. Applying these values and assuming a range of mPC prevalence between 1030%, the PPV ranged from 49.5-79.1 for ICD-alone and from 44.3-75.4 for ICD + treatment; the NPV ranged from 88.8 to 96.8 for ICD-alone and from 91.3 to 97.6 for ICD + treatment. Conclusions: In the VA system, an algorithm based on ICD codes for secondary malignant neoplasms alone had high specificity but modest sensitivity. Adding treatments for metastatic PC to the ICD-alone algorithm enhanced sensitivity with little impact on specificity, and thus is a feasible approach to identify mPC in the absence of chart review.

An algorithm was developed using a national administrative claims database with linked date of death to predict death within 61 days of disenrollment (ROC ,"" 0.933 in beneficiaries < 65 years). Objectives: To conduct an external validation of an algorithm to predict death at disenrollment in order to understand performance of the algorithm in different study populations. Methods: Validation data came from a large private health insurance provider in North Carolina (NC) from 2006-2018. Claims were linked to death records from the NC Department of Health and Human Services using a hierarchical matching algorithm. We identified a subpopulation of beneficiaries aged 18-64 years with a pain diagnosis, surgery, or opioid analgesic and one year of continuous enrollment prior to disenrollment. Individuals were excluded if still enrolled at the end of the study period or 64th year of age. We evaluated model performance using C-statistics, sensitivity, and specificity overall and in subgroups of interest (age, sex, calendar year). Results: We identified 1 224 073 individuals who disenrolled during the study period, of whom 14 190 (1.2%) died within 61 days of disenrollment. Overall model performance in the validation data was high (ROC: 0.899). At a predicted probability threshold of 80%, the algorithm classified 1.3% of disenrollments as deaths with sensitivity of 0.448 and specificity of 0.992. Sensitivity improved at lower probability thresholds. In subgroup analyzes, model performance was a little higher among females (sensitivity: 0.490, specificity: 0.995, ROC: 0.926) than males (sensitivity: 0.422, specificity: 0.990, ROC: 0.870) at the 80% prediction probability threshold. Performance was highest among ages 55-64 (sensitivity: 0.591, specificity: 0.973, ROC: 0.890) and lowest among ages 18-34 (sensitivity: 0.042, specificity: 1.00, ROC: 0.815).

5981,"Methods: In this population-based study, we assessed multimorbidity on April 1, 2019 for all residents >65 years in Quebec, Canada (n ,"" 1.4 million). We used linked hospitalization, physician and drug claims records from 1999 to 2020. We identified diseases with the International classification of diseases (ICD) system in hospitalization and physician claims for two lists of medical conditions: 1) the Comorbidity Combined index (CCI) (combination of Charlson and Elixhauser measures including 31 conditions associated with death); and 2) the Calderon multimorbidity measure (CMM) (60 conditions that regroup all chronic disease codes included in ICD). We considered LWs ranging from 1 to 20 years and evaluated their impact on 1) the prevalence of multimorbidity (defined as 2, 3 or 4 conditions); 2) the capacity (c-statistic) to predict 1-year outcomes: mortality, hospitalization, polypharmacy, as well as general practitioner, specialist, or emergency department (ED) visits. Results: The prevalence of multimorbidity increased continuously with increasing LWs, although it decelerated after 10 years (e.g., multimorbidity 2: LW "","" 1y: [14% CCI; 20% CMM], LW "","" 10y: [58% CCI; 84% CMM], LW "","" 20y: [69% CCI; 92% CMM]). Impact of LWs on prediction capacity varied widely between lists of medical conditions, multimorbidity definitions, and the outcome considered. Maximal performance was reached with shorter LWs for the larger list of medical conditions (CMM) compared to the smaller list (CCI) (e.g., multimorbidity 4, ED visits: maximal c-statistic reached with LW "", 4y for CMM [0.714; 95% CI: 0.711-0.716] vs LW ,"" 10y for CCI [0.718; 95% CI: 0.716-0.720]).

Of those, 250 cases were randomly selected (50% males) and de-identified patient profiles were built based on (i) demographic information and including information on timing relative to the diagnosis of AMI: (ii) all hospitalizations, all diagnoses and procedures, and discharge reasons, (iii) all outpatient diagnoses including diagnostic certainty and specialty of the diagnosing physician from up to 5 years before and up to 1 year after the event and (iv) all outpatient encounters and (v) all outpatient dispensings up to 1 year before and up to 1 year after the event. Using adjudication criteria based on clinical guidelines and risk factors, 2 trained physicians independently classified cases as `definite', `probable', `unlikely', and `non-assessable'. Positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated as the percentage of confirmed cases (`definite' or `probable') among all cases excluding those classified as ""non-assessable"". Results: 65 298 AMI cases were eligible for validation (22 804 females, 42 494 males). Agreement between experts was good, 93.6% of cases were classified concordantly: 228 as `definite/probable', 4 as `unlikely' and 2 as `non-assessable'. After discussion of the remaining 16 profiles with a third physician, 242 cases were classified as `definite/probable', 6 as `unlikely', and 2 as `non-assessable'. This resulted in a PPV of 97.6%.

Results: We describe eight steps as a guide to reseachers in designing causal studies with observational data. Step 1: Define an explicit causal research question.

A total of 22 patient characteristics including demographics, comorbidities, medication use, and RA severity were assessed in all PS estimation approaches. We compared the performance of each PS estimation method by examining number of imbalanced covariates (standardized mean difference 0.1, evaluated via bal.tab function in R) after matching, and the extent of matching-related attrition in the treated group. Results: There were six imbalanced covariates in the unmatched sample. After PS matching on a 1:3 ratio, both logistic regression and random forest achieved zero imbalanced covariates with similar treatment group attrition (~52%) regardless of caliper width used. GBM and XGBoost each yielded one imbalanced covariate with less attrition in this context, especially XGBoost (9% when 0.1 caliper was used and 32% when 0.01 caliper was used).

However, in early clinical trial phases, due to limited follow-up time and cohort size, surrogate endpoints (such as Progression-Free Survival) are used as estimates of OS. In many cases though, these surrogate endpoints do not correlate well with OS. Objectives: To create an early indicator of OS that can reliably estimate efficacy in early clinical trial phases.

Results: The framework holistically evaluates proposed RW-CER studies using an adaptation of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework, with each step in the feasibility pathway taking the place of the GRADE outcomes. Each step is assessed against four criteria: study limitations (risk of bias), imprecision, inconsistency of results, and indirectness of evidence. For each step, a risk score (scale 0-2) is given for each of the four criteria leading to an overall suitability score to proceed to CER of 0-8 (0-2: high; 3-4: moderate; 5-6: low; 7-8: very low). The outcomes of the feasibility assessment in conjunction with the pre-design phase aided optimal study design to help overcome any perceived limitations in the assessed RW-CER studies in COPD. Conclusions: This framework will help overcome the challenges of RW-CER by providing a fully transparent assessment, supporting or not supporting the decision to proceed with RW-CER studies, and identifying limitations to be addressed through study design. Practical application of this framework has been demonstrated in RW-CER studies in COPD. Funding: GSK (214731)",1.0,disease,True

6038,"Background: Machine learning (ML) is an atractive tool to develop a prediction model of the treatment response. Class imbalance is a known problem for ML-based prediction models, commonly favoring a higher accuracy for the majority class at the expense of the minority class. Objectives: To test the feasibility of the recently proposed approach for imbalanced data sets: random forests quantile classifier (RFQ). Methods: This study uses retrospective registry data of Kawasaki disease (KD)-the most common childhood vasculitis of unknown etiology-in Japan. This data set includes 599 responders (77.9%) and 170 non-responders (22.1%) to the standard treatment of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion. Non-response indicates a high risk of cardiovascular sequelae due to KD, and patients predicted to be nonresponders are candidates for intensified therapy during the earlystage disease course. Two random forest (RF)-based models were constructed to predict IVIG unresponsiveness: traditional RF (i.e., without addressing class imbalance) and the RFQ-based method. For these models, the misclassification rates were calculated and compared. The randomForestSRC R package (ver. 3.0.1) was used for the computation.",1.0,disease,True

Additional approaches are needed to evaluate epidemiologic methods in controlled but realistic settings. Objectives: Develop a method to a) create cohorts with known treatment effects but without simulating the exposure, outcome, or covariates, and b) evaluate its use for comparing epidemiologic analyzes. Methods: Using data from 5 randomized clinical trials in 3 therapeutic areas (i.e., HIV, metastatic colorectal cancer, T2DM), we simulated cohorts with clinically meaningful covariate imbalance patterns. For each trial, we identified a subset of covariates associated with the outcome and expected to influence treatment choice in real-world settings. A patient's probability of being selected into the simulated cohort was based on these covariates, investigator-specified parameters, and treatment-group specific thresholds. Parameter values for logistic regression models were defined to induce stronger or weaker selection. As a result of selecting only some patients from each treatment arm for inclusion in a cohort, the sample size was reduced by half leading to unstable effect estimates when the source trial was small (n< 800). We re-sampled the trial with replacement, such that the simulated cohort's sample size approximated the original trial. Gcomputation was used to recover the true treatment effect in the simulated cohorts accounting for potential changes in the distribution of effect measure modifiers between the trial and the cohorts. Multiple confounding scenarios were created using different selection parameters, and 1000 iterations were simulated for each. Results: A total of 106 unique scenarios were created: 51 from positive trials (mean true HR , 0.77 [range: 0.51-0.87]) and 55 from null trials (HR ,"" 0.97 [0.93-1.10]).

Objectives: To identify potential BZD 3DI signals associated with increased rates of injury. Methods: We conducted semi-automated high-throughput screening of 2000-2019 administrative data from De-identified Optum's Clinformatics® Data Mart. Using the self-controlled case series design, we included patients aged 16 years who had injury while using a BZD+co-dispensed medication (i.e., base pair). During observation time with continuous base pair use, we identified other co-dispensed medications as candidate interacting precipitants. We compared injury rates during observation time exposed to the base pair with vs. without candidate interacting precipitants using conditional Poisson regression, adjusting for time-varying covariates. We calculated rate ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and accounted for multiple estimation via semi-Bayes shrinkage. Results: We examined 65 123 BZD triads in adjusted analyzes, 79 of which (0.1%) were associated with increased injury rates and thus deemed 3DI signals.

6063,"Background: In pharmacoepidemiology comorbidity burden is commonly measured for confounder adjustment or subgroup stratifications. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is commonly used for that purpose and can be calculated using registry data. However, it is unclear what is the most appropriate lookback period for calculating CCI. Objectives: To assess the association between the length of CCI lookback period with its ability to predict one-year mortality. Methods: We included patients with hip fracture in Denmark (2015- 2017) and on the date of admission, computed CCIs with 1 À30 years' lookback periods based on hospital diagnoses in the Danish National Patient Registry. Deaths were ascertained in the Danish Civil Registration System. The predictive ability of 1-year mortality of different CCI lookback periods was measured with the C-index for a model with CCI added to a base model of age and sex using logistic regression. This C-index was used as a proxy for the model's ability to adjust for comorbidity as a confounder. In addition, we compared mortality of the subgroup with high CCI (patients with 3 or more points on the weighted CCI-scale) as identified with 1- and 30-years lookback periods. Results: The 11 391 hip fracture patients had an overall 1-year mortality of 23%. The base model had a C-index of 0.711. In all the models, including CCI with any choice of lookback-period between 1 and 30 years C-indices ranged between 0.745 and 0.748. Based on 1-year and 30-years of lookback period we identified 723 and 2796 patients respectively with a high CCI. The 1-year mortality in these respective groups was 45% and 35%. Conclusions: While CCI added additional predictive ability to the base model, the choice of length of lookback period between 1 and 30 years had minimal impact on the model's ability to predict 1-year mortality in hip fracture patients.

Methods: An ISPE-funded work group was led by members of the ISPE Academic Council. To ensure applicability of findings to multiple areas, the working group consisted of 14 ISPE members with positions in academia, industry, government, and other settings. Experience ranged from early to advanced career professionals, representing multiple countries across 4 continents. All competencies outlined by Jones et al were extracted from the manuscript and presented to the work group. Expert-based judgments were collated and used to identify consensus; the work group were asked to consider which competencies could still be considered ""core"" and whether any further competencies should be added to the list. In addition, the work group proposed five core domains based on the competencies presented and subsequently mapped all core competencies to these domains.

6089,"(3/2013-6/2018; washout , 365 d) and assessed obesity and tobacco use in the 365 days prior to and including index dispensing. EHR-based BMI was calculated using closest valid height and weight to index and categorized as underweight/normal (15<,""BMI< 25), overweight (25<"",""BMI< 30), obese (30<"",BMI< 40) and severely obese (40<,BMI<,""90). Claims-based BMI and obesity was based on presence of a diagnosis or procedure code, using the code closest to index. For the obese and severely obese, we used a narrow claims definition (BMI-specific codes) and broad definition (BMI-specific and generic obesity codes). EHR-based tobacco use was defined by the populated record closest to index. Claims-based tobacco use was defined by diagnosis code or dispensing of a tobacco cessation product. We cross-stratified users' claims and EHR data to compare designations across data sources. Results: We identified 3155 new SGLT-2i users, of which 1936 (61%) had an EHR-based BMI, with 69% obese or severely obese; 43% had any claims code, with 98% of those obese or severely obese (broad definition). Among the 1936 with an EHR BMI, 277 users (14%) had concordant claims data using the narrow obesity definition and 853 (44%) with the broad definition of obesity. Among all other users, 35% had neither EHR BMI nor code, 44% had an EHR BMI but no corresponding code, 18% had a code but no corresponding EHR BMI, and 3% had disagreement between the two sources. For the broad definition, concordance between EHR and claims for obesity and severe obesity was 54% and 86%. Among the cohort of SGLT-2i users, 2205 (70%) had an EHR record for tobacco use with 965 (44%) indicating current or former use. Among current/former users, 40% had a concordant claims-based code. Concordance was higher for current users (77%) than former users (32%). There were 1194 SGLT-2i users (38%) with an EHR record indicating `never smoker'; of these, 2% had a contradicting code for smoking. There were 143 users (5%) who had a claim for smoking but no EHR data. Conclusions: Among those treated with an SGLT-2i, concordance between claims and EHR data was good for current tobacco use. For obesity, using a more sensitive definition in claims increased concordance with EHR data. Characterization of missingness and clinical measurement concordance for key confounders could inform quantitative bias analysis or imputation approaches for future work.""",1.0,clinical,True

6092,"Background: In propensity score (PS)-based analyzes of medication safety and effectiveness, investigators might estimate stratum-specific PSs for sex or age to examine heterogeneous treatment effects and confounding structures. Stratifying by racial and ethnic categories may be useful for similar reasons; specifically, stratification may better reflect the structural drivers of racial and ethnic inequities compared to individual-level adjustment for racial and ethnic categories as main effect terms in a PS model. Objectives: To compare covariate balance across 3 strategies of including race and ethnicity in propensity scores in an activecomparator new-user cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries. Methods: We used a 20% random sample of US Medicare beneficiaries age 66 years with fee-for-service and Part D coverage who were classified as non-Hispanic (NH) white, NH Black, or Hispanic using CMS' ""RTI race code,"" and initiated DPP4 inhibitors (DPP4i) or sulfonylureas (SU) while on metformin during 2008-2015 using a 1-year lookback. Using 56 covariates, we fit logistic regression models to estimate PSs under 3 strategies: (1) ""full-cohort"" PS model with main effect term for racial/ethnic category; (2) ""full cohort"" PS with interaction terms between racial/ethnic category and each covariate; and (3) separate stratum-specific PS models for each racial/ethnic category. After calculating inverse probability of treatment weights for each strategy, we assessed covariate balance between DPP4i/SU initiators separately for each racial/ethnic category, summarized using average and maximum standardized absolute mean differences (ASAMD and MSAMD). Results: Among 23 807 individuals, 77.9% were classified as NH white, 8.4% NH Black, and 13.7% Hispanic; 28.0%, 31.8%, and 31.6% initiated a DPP4i versus SU, respectively. In crude data, ASAMD and MSAMD were 0.05, 0.31 (NH white); 0.07, 0.47 (NH Black); and 0.10, 0.33 (Hispanic). In strategy #1, ASAMD and MSAMD were 0.01, 0.06 (NH white); 0.05, 0.22 (NH Black); and 0.04, 0.22 (Hispanic); importantly, the covariate with maximum imbalance differed by racial/ethnic category: anticholinergic use for NH white, year for NH Black, and number of metformin pills for Hispanic. Strategies #2 and #3 were functionally identical and yielded the best ASAMD and MSAMD: 0.00, 0.04 (NH white); 0.02, 0.10 (NH Black); and 0.01, 0.07 (Hispanic). Conclusions: Stratifying by racial/ethnic category may improve confounding control while supporting assessment of structural inequities and heterogeneity of treatment effects. These results underscore the importance of modeling assumptions corresponding to structural factors. This study incorporated an active comparator, but covariate imbalance is likely worse in non-active-comparator settings.",1.0,,True

6098,"Background: The heterogeneity of an exposed population may result in differentiated therapeutic response and/or adverse reactions (AR). There is a lack of systematic assessment of the extent to which quantitative data mining on spontaneous reports correlates with subgroup safety risk differences. Objectives: To assess the concordance between subgroup disproportionality scores and PRAC discussions of subgroup risk. Methods: We implemented the subgroup methodology of Sandberg et al. [1] to statistically screen subgroup that may be at increased risk of adverse events. The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data, cumulative through 2Q 2021, were used as the data source. Test cases to determine concordance were identified by reviewing EMA Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) minutes from 2015-2019 and any mention of a potential subgroup at a differentiated risk, where the subgroup overlapped with the Sandberg methodology, were included. [1] Sandberg L., et al.: Drug Saf. 2020, 43(10): 999-1009. Results: 28 PRAC subgroup examples were included in the analysis representing 1866 subgroup product event (SPE) combinations in FAERS, out of which 1123, 395 and 346 SPEs considered patient's age, underlying condition, and sex, respectively. Applying the subgroup methodology 12 951 SPEs for age and 3021 SPEs for sex were detected, of which only 2 and only 1, respectively, were concordant with the PRAC SPEs. None of the 175 794 SPEs detected for underlying condition were concordant with the 395 PRAC SPEs. Conclusions: Very poor concordance was found between subgroup disproportionality scores and PRAC discussions of differentiated subgroup risk. Several examples concerned subgroups overrepresented in the database or specific to the drug or event and could only be detected if the requirement on not being disproportionate overall was relaxed. Also, most examples were diluted among several active ingredients, MedDRA Preferred Terms and age subgroups; regrouping these at other or customed levels might have improved the performance. Other data sources might be beneficial particularly for underlying condition subgroups however additional work is needed to better understand what improvements are required in methods and/or data to enable more robust subgroup risk identification.",1.0,case,True

A cross-protection of previous live attenuated vaccinations has been put forward to explain COVID's low impact in children; but the litterature is controversial on this topic. Objectives: To evaluate the effect of live attenuated MMR vaccine on the risk of being hospitalized with COVID-19 in children. Methods: We conducted an exposed/non-exposed cohort study using the nationwide French health care database (SNDS), which records all in-and outpatient claims, as well as hospital discharges, for more than 65 million inhabitants from birth to death. We included all children born between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019 and followed them from March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021. Exposure was defined as a claim for at least one dose of MMR vaccine (ATC code J07BD52) ever since birth. Study outcome consisted of COVID-19 main, related or associated hospitalization diagnosis (ICD10 codes). Variables significantly associated with both exposure and hospitalization for COVID19 were selected for multivariate analysis. We used a conditional logistic regression to evaluate the association between MMR exposure and hospitalization with COVID-19, controlling for age, sex, universal health coverage, residence, social deprivation index and pediatric chronic conditions. Results: The children's cohort included 7 184 704 (49% female) followed during 18 months, among which data on MMR exposure was available on 6 800 542 (median age 6 years IQR [38]) and 384 162 (6 years [3-9]) exposed and non-exposed respectively. Among them, 1747 and 83 were hospitalized in exposed and non-exposed groups respectively. Exposure to MMR vaccine in children was not associated with a decreased risk of COVID hospitalization compared to nonexposure (Adjusted Odd Ratio aOR [95% CI] ,"" 0.94 [0.78-1.15]). Exploration of factors of COVID-19 hospitalization identified significant aOR for Universal Health Coverage (1.79 [1.611.98]), respiratory diseases (2.35 [2.09-2.64]), neurologic diseases (4.06 [3.34-4.94]), congenital or genetic defects (2.72 [2.01-3.68]), and metabolic diseases (2.94 [2.10-4.12]).

6108,"Background: Cost-effectiveness and feasibility of large clinical trials may be improved by using simplified study protocols that collect only major clinical outcomes. Selective safety data collection, where nonserious adverse events are not captured in case report forms, may simplify trials without impacting overall safety knowledge. Objectives: The aim of our study is to evaluate how much new safety information is added to the drug label for cardiometabolic agents following large trials reported after initial authorization. Methods: We evaluated changes made to the safety section (section 4.8 `undesirable effects') of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of cardiometabolic drugs approved between 2000 and 2020 following submission of the results of large (>1000 patients) clinical trials to the European Medicine Agency. We focused on three drug classes: blood glucose lowering, antithrombotic and lipid-modifying agents. The primary outcome was the number of changes in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the SmPC safety section. Results: The EMA reviewed 55 large trials concerning 25 cardiometabolic agents after the initial marketing authorization. These trials included 402 444 patients and were submitted a median of 4.7 years (interquartile range: 2.8; 8.3) after drug approval. Ultimately, 38 trials (69%) resulted in a safety section update of the SmPC, while 17 trials (31%) did not. Changes in ADRs were made following 19 (35%) trials for 12 agents: 77 new ADRs were added, 11 were deleted, and the frequencies of 43 were changed. Most changes in ADRs arose from trials with antithrombotic agents (88%) and trials performed in a new population (92%). Conclusions: Large trials for cardiometabolic agents reported after authorization add limited new safety information on ADRs, especially when performed in the population studied prior to approval. This suggests that limiting safety data collection does not reduce learnings from late-stage cardiometabolic trials in populations, which had been comprehensively studied before. Adverse reactions may be collected further through spontaneous reporting systems.",1.0,clinical,True

However, once diagnosed and despite COVID, patients in 2021 & 2020 were as likely or slightly more likely to have timely visits and receive timely 1L than 2019 patients [% with timely visit: 91% (91%-92%) in 2019, 92% (91%-92%) in 2020, 95% (95%-96%) in 2021; % with timely 1L: 62% (61%-63%) in 2019, 64% (6265%) in 2020, 64% (62%-65%) in 2021]. Missingness pattern and distribution of baseline characteristics were similar across years except stage: among 1L patients, compared to 2019 [60% (59%- 62%)], the proportion of de novo stage IV was similar in 2020 [60% (59%-62%)] but higher in 2021 [65% (63%-66%)].

For proof-of-concept, we conducted a pharmacoepidemiological study in Denmark to pharmacologically substantiate death associated with valproate use in people aged 65 years or older. Additionally, using this real-world data we trained an artificial neural network (long-short term memory (LSTM)) for prediction of plasma concentrations of valproate to compare it with traditional pharmacometric models. Results: PHARMACOM-EPI describes practical details on how to identify pharmacometric models (propose research question, conduct search, extract data about model development), characterize the models (representativeness of sample and sampling scheme used for model development, model performance), apply pharmacometric models to real-world data (choose software, format dataset, handle missing covariates/dosing data, perform external evaluation of models) and provide pharmacological substantiation of pharmacoepidemiological findings (obtain predictions and relate these to therapeutic window). Accuracy of population predictions from eight valproate pharmacometric models to categorize concentrations into subtherapeutic (< 50 mg/L), therapeutic (50-100 mg/L) and toxic (>100 mg/L) *** range was 0.07-0.50, but that of LSTM 0.64.

Analysis: We estimated outcome sensitivity and specificity with a probabilistic validation study[10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103258] in each database and estimated treatment effects with logistic regression using propensity score (PS) matching without vs with QBA. In QBA, we used outcome sensitivity and specificity estimates non-differential to exposure status to correct observed exposure-outcome 2x2 table counts before fitting outcome models. We then applied multidimensional QBA across a range of sensitivity and specificity values. Results: Sensitivity ranged from 38.0-58.9% and specificity from 99.0-99.9% across databases.

Objectives: We aimed to assess the number of new medicines that were granted SMA, AEC or CMA supported by uncontrolled pivotal trials and the EMA's justification for the acceptance of these trials over time. Methods: We included all initial MAs approved by the EMA in 1995- 2020 that were based on new complete dossiers (i.e., excluding, among others, generics and biosimilars) and were supported by uncontrolled pivotal trials. We extracted EMA's arguments for the acceptance of uncontrolled pivotal trials from European Public Assessment Reports.

We defined the duration of each patient's baseline history as the number of months between the earliest recorded visit in the N3C EHR and the first COVID-related admission. We calculated standardized mean differences (SMD) to compare demographic factors, medications, and comorbidities recorded on admission and during baseline between those with no prior visits, those with 1-23 months of history, and those with 24+ months of history. Results: Among 43 462 patients who were hospitalized for COVID19, 12 523 (28.8%) had no prior visit in the N3C EHR, 9784 (22.5%) had 1-23 months of history, and 21 155 (48.7%) had 24+ months of history. Compared to patients with 24+ months of history, patients with no prior visits were younger (59, IQR: [45, 71] vs 65, IQR: [52, 77]), more likely to be male (61% vs 47%), less likely to be white (45% vs 59%), less likely to have recorded diagnoses for comorbidities such as hypertension (45% vs 74%), diabetes (33% vs 45%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7.4% vs 18%). The largest SMDs were for hypertension (0.50) and prescriptions (statins: 0.83; ACE inhibitors: 0.55; angiotensin II receptor blockers: 0.46). Patients with no prior visits were also twice as likely to be ventilated on admission (19% vs 8.8%) and 27% more likely to experience inpatient mortality (14% vs 11%). Conclusions: Despite being younger with fewer recorded risk-factors for severe COVID-19, patients with no prior visits in the N3C EHR were more likely to be ventilated on admission and experience inpatient mortality. These patients may represent a heterogeneous mixture of individuals who were previously healthy (truly without comorbidities), patients who received routine care elsewhere (comorbidities present, but data are missing due to health system fragmentation), and patients with unmet medical need (comorbidities present but not documented in any health system due to poor access to healthcare). Researchers will need to be aware of the potential information bias in estimated treatment effects among hospitalized patients that may be present if differences in EHR continuity are not properly accounted for in analyzes.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Objectives: To replicate and update a landmark self-controlled case series study on association of antidepressants and risk of hip fracture, conducted using The UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink data over 1987-1999 (Hubbard 2003), in a large US claims database using Instant Health Data (IHD) rapid analytics platform. Methods: Using Optum's de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database, all patients with diagnosis of hip fracture or fractured neck of femur between 2010-01-01 and 2019-12-31 were identified. Event date was defined as date of first recorded diagnosis for hip fracture. Person-time was segmented into days 0-14, 15-42, and >43 following first antidepressant prescription, with end date of exposure defined as last prescription day plus days supplied, allowing for treatment gaps up to 30 days. Two 91-day washout periods were included following end of treatment. Remaining person time was classified as baseline. Following Hubbard, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated for exposure to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) separately. Results: We identified 177 961 patients with diagnosis of hip fracture. The mean(SD) age of cases was 75.95(14.83) and 68.9% were female. Rates of exposure to TCAs pre-index were 4.24% and 2.76% for cases and controls, while corresponding rates for SSRI exposure pre-index were 22.6% and 14.17%. Rates for TCAs were higher in Hubbard et al (cases: 17.8%; controls: 11.8%) and lower for SSRIs (5.5% and 3.0%). IRRs for fracture in days 0-14, 15-42, and >43 of tricyclic treatment were IRR(CI): [1.51 (1.30, 1.76), 1.23(1.07, 1.41), 1.23(1.14, 1.32)] and for SSRIs: [1.77(1.67, 1.87), 1.52(1.44, 1.59), 1.37(1.33, 1.41)]. Results reported by Hubbard et al were directionally similar but higher in magnitude for TCAs: [2.30 (1.82, 2.90), 1.88(1.55, 2.28), 1.18 (1.06, 1.31)] and for SSRIs: [1.96(1.35, 2.68), 2.03 (1.53, 2.68), 1.54(1.33, 1.78)]. Increased risk of fracture was observed in the first washout period for both TCAs and SSRIs with IRR(CI) of 1.15(1.06, 1.26) and 1.33(1.28, 1.37), but no increased risk was observed in the second washout period. The same finding was observed by Hubbard et al. Risk of hip fracture increased with age and was significantly elevated in patients 85 years or older. Conclusions: In this study, we were able to confirm the association between use of antidepressants and the incidence of hip fracture using contemporary data and modern analytic tools.",1.0,case,True

Objectives: To determine the overall patient satisfaction, outcomes, and experience with propofol during surgery. Methods: A prospective questionnaire based observational study was carried for six months in pre & post operative holding theaters in a large tertiary care teaching hospital. Patients of any gender above 18 years undergoing surgery with propofol were recruited with consent. Demographic details were collected perioperatively along with two questionnaires- the Bauer patient satisfaction questionnaire and the modified Brice questionnaire at 24th, and 48th hour post-surgery to determine the perceptive outcomes. The data was assessed categorically and represented as n (%). Results: A total of 246 subjects {[78 (31.70%) females] & [168 (68.30%) males]} were recruited who completed both the questionnaires, of which majority of the patients were of age 18-30 years [60 (24.39%)]. Majority of subjects [52.03% (n ,"" 128)] were found to have an American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of Grade II. Surgery site pain [37.57% (31.57% moderate & 5.69% severe)] was the most frequently cited discomfort despite analgesic management, followed by thirst [23.30% (21.95% moderate & 1.35% severe)] and pain at the site of anesthesia injection [20.86% (18.70% moderate & 2.17% severe)] at the post 24 & 48hour interval. Furthermore, pain was perceived to be the worst thing in operation memory [27 (10.97%)], followed by anxiety [6 (2.43%)]. Despite these perceptions, 90.78% of patients were very satisfied with the overall anesthesia related care received. The incidence of accidental awareness during general anesthesia (AAGA) was found to be 5 [(2.04%)]. Conclusions: Discomfort after surgery is common, despite the anesthesia care. Patient reported outcomes, experience, satisfaction, and all related domains provide a comprehensive assessment of the quality of anesthesia care.

6151,"Methods: In this scoping review, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify relevant studies from 2001-2020 written in English. Eligible studies included prenatal or childhood exposure to PPIs and/or H2RAs and the risk of new pediatric immunologic disease diagnosis in humans. Two authors independently screened studies, first by title/abstract screen and second by full-text review; discrepancies were reconciled by consensus. One author abstracted descriptive meta-data and summary results; data were confirmed by a second author. Results: Of 2458 citations screened, 20 papers were eligible for inclusion. Most published studies (17) were from Europe or the USA. Cohort studies were most common (11), followed by case-control (4), case-crossover (2), systematic reviews (2), and cross-sectional (1). Median sample size was 11 277 (3452, 154 237). Most studies (16) were performed within electronic databases; 3 studies' data were self-reported. Overall, 18 papers reported on both PPI and H2RA use, 2 on PPIs, and none solely on H2RAs; the majority (13) examined prenatal exposure, 7 examined childhood exposure, and 1 both. Most papers (16) focused on allergic outcomes (most commonly asthma or atopic dermatitis); 4 studies examined gastrointestinal diseases (eosinophilic esophagitis or inflammatory bowel disease). In all but 1 study, positive associations were reported between prenatal or early childhood exposure to PPIs and/or H2RA and incident pediatric immunologic diseases; a dose-response relationship was tested and present in just 2 studies. Commonly reported limitations were unmeasured confounding, including confounding by indication, and protopathic bias. Conclusions: Most studies identified in this scoping review reported positive associations between prenatal or early childhood exposure to acid suppressive drugs and incident pediatric immunologic diseases, particularly asthma and other allergic diseases. Few studies have examined autoimmune disease outcomes, and concerns for residual confounding were common. Further research will help clarify the nature and magnitude of immunologic risks from early exposure to acid suppressive drugs, to inform shared decision-making and clinical guidelines on PPI/H2RA usage during pregnancy and early childhood.",1.0,disease,True
6152,"Methods: Using the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) Registry, we included all individuals enrolled with non-systemic JIA. We defined the maximally tolerated disease activity by identifying registry visits where there had been no medication change for >180 days prior to and 60 days following the visit. Individuals could contribute more than one observation. Disease activity was classified based on the clinical Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score 10 (cJADAS10) for ID, cJADAS10 LDA, and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) provisional criteria for clinical ID (ACR CID). The association of patient characteristics (age, sex, race, category of JIA, time since diagnosis, age at diagnosis, number of prior medications, and physician global, active joint count, patient global, and morning stiffness at the visit prior to index visit) and tolerated disease activity of ID/LDA were assessed by logistic regression. Results: There were 6235 individuals with non-systemic JIA with 16 187 observations of no medication change for >180 + 60 days.

High-risk status as defined by the CDC included: age < 5 years, ICD-10 diagnoses consistent with asthma, children with any complex chronic condition including immunosuppression, pregnancy or post-partum state, living in a chronic care facility, or a high-intensity neurologic co-morbidity. The primary outcome was prevalence of AAP/CDC guideline concordant antiviral treatment, defined as a pharmacy dispensing claim for oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, or baloxavir within two days of influenza diagnosis. We determined patient and provider level factors associated with guideline concordant treatment using multivariable logistic regression. Results: A total of 363 490 high-risk children with influenza were included. The prevalence of guideline concordant treatment was 58.4% (n , 212 155). Oseltamivir accounted for nearly all antiviral prescriptions (n ,"" 212 142, 99.9%). Prevalence of concordant treatment varied by influenza season, ranging from 51.7-62.9%. Hispanic ethnicity (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.44, 1.52), non-Hispanic Black race (aOR 1.08, 95% CI 1.06, 1.10), concurrent asthma diagnosis (aOR 1.13, 95% CI 1.11, 1.15), immunosuppression (aOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05, 1.16), and urgent care location (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.44, 1.52), were associated with a higher adjusted odds of guideline concordant treatment. Age < 5 (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.44, 1.52), living in a chronic care facility (aOR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46, 0.83), being evaluated in an emergency department (aOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.63, 0.65), and diagnosis of a concurrent lower respiratory infection (aOR 0.69, 95% CI 0.66, 0.73) were associated with a lower adjusted odds of guideline concordant treatment.

6163,"Objectives: To characterize the identification of pediatric RW in healthcare databases using International Classification of Disease (ICD) diagnosis codes. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review within Pubmed and Embase to identify studies examining pediatric RW within healthcare databases published between January 1, 2000 and August 3, 2021. ICD codes used to identify RW were abstracted from the publications. The search was restricted to manuscripts where RW was the outcome as identified by ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes in a pediatric ( 18 years old) study population. Results: We identified 18 studies that utilized ICD coding algorithms for identifying pediatric RW. 14 studies used electronic health record data either in isolation or in tandem with other data sources, whereas only 8 studies used claims data in some capacity. 12 of the studies used ICD-9 codes, 9 studies used ICD-10 and 3 studies used both. There was a trichotomy of RW coding patterns observed in these studies. The first group of studies (n ,"" 4) identified RW with the codes of 786.07 """"Wheezing"""" or R06.2 """"Wheezing"""". The second group (n "","" 7) defined RW as a subset of asthma or synonymous with asthma. This group used either a combination of wheezing (786.07 or R06.2) and asthma codes (493.X """"Asthma"""", J45 """"Asthma"""") or asthma codes in isolation. The third group of studies (n "","" 7) used a broader set of ICD codes related to a variety of respiratory outcomes in addition to wheezing and asthma codes. None of the identified studies validated pediatric RW through a medical record review. Among studies we excluded, RW was commonly identified through unstructured data including patient notes and parent reports Conclusions: Diagnosis codes can streamline outcome identification in real world data. This literature review sheds light on some of the difficulties of defining and identifying RW in children. There was no clear consensus on how authors defined RW as evident from the various reported algorithms. Authors' choices of codes are aligned with their definitions of RW. Some authors treated RW as an extension of pediatric asthma, and either identified RW exclusively with asthma codes or a combination of asthma and wheezing codes.

6187,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly affected health care delivery and receipt. Changes in the management of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) have garnered less attention, in part due to the lower levels of COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality in children. As a chronic disease in children, JIA is a valuable use-case. Objectives: Our hypothesis was that the pandemic led to fewer outpatient visits, fewer initiations of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), fewer intraarticular glucocorticoid (iaGC) injections, and more use of higher-risk, short-term therapies, including oral glucocorticoids (oGC) and opioids. Methods: Using commercial health plan members, we found incident JIA occurring Mar 2016 to Feb 2021 based on previously used algorithms. We required 12 months of enrollment prior to diagnosis and age < 18 on diagnosis. Anchored on 01Mar2020, we studied 90-day quarters (Q1 was Mar-May) in 2018-21 to determine rates of outpatient visits, DMARD initiation, iaGC injections, and dispensings of oGC and opioids. Rates were modeled with quarter, sex, region, age, JIA type, uveitis (DMARD and visits only), pediatric disease burden (visits only), SES quartile (visits only), and stratified by diagnosis recency (incident was within 1 year after diagnosis). We present adjusted percentages (95% CI) comparing 2020 to prior years.",1.0,COVID-19,True
6188,"Results: In our cohort of 1294 patients with JIA, 71% were female, mean diagnosis age was 11 (SD 4.5), 15% had systemic JIA, and 131 were diagnosed in 2020. For all patients with JIA, outpatient visits declined by 11% (8%,14%) in 2020-21, most markedly in Q1 with later rebound. DMARD initiation showed no difference in rates [incident: À46% (À75%, 65%); prevalent: 5% (À56%, 151%)], though prevalent patients crude rates showed a sharp Q1 drop. iaGC injections showed no difference in either group [incident: À5% (À66%, 166%); prevalent: - 27% (À68%, 24%)]; however, oGC was cut by nearly half [incident: À44%(À71%, 8%); prevalent: À43% (À62%, À15%)]. Opioid dispensing showed a 54% decrease among prevalent patients (75%, À18%), but no difference among incident patients [À6% (À70%, 193%)]. Conclusions: Modest decreases in healthcare and drug utilization were observed early in the pandemic. Patients with prevalent JIA experienced overall decreases in JIA treatment utilization, delayed initiation of DMARDs, and reduced rates of oGC and opioids than in prior years. Unexpectedly, these results imply reduced use of potentially toxic and inappropriate short-term treatments for patients with prevalent JIA. Small outcome counts for incidence patients resulted in wide variance and no clear interpretation.

Although ES can affect any bone, it primary presents in long bones such as the humerus, tibia, and femur. The incidence of ES varies significantly with age but is most seen in adolescent patients; although, specific incidence rates in literature vary. The most recent ES incidence estimates come from Jawad et al.

Regarding the management of CD, there is a broad international consensus favoring timely diagnosis and non-pharmacological treatment in outpatient settings. However, there is some evidence that CD often go underdiagnosed and when diagnosed, little is known on treatment initiatives. Objectives: We aimed to compare across four Western countries (Denmark, Germany, Norway, and US) the prevalence of CD, antipsychotic treatment, psychiatric hospitalizations, psychiatric comorbidity, and speciality of the diagnosing physician. Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, we used administrative data to identify children and adolescents (aged 0-19 years) with an ICD-10 diagnosis code for CD (F91, F90.1, or F92) at any point in calendar year 2018. Prevalence was determined within each country's study population. We calculated the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity and psychotropic treatment, and quantified the prevalence and duration of psychiatric hospitalization for each country. Results: CD prevalence differed 31-fold between countries, ranging from 0.1% (Denmark) to 3.1% (Germany). Nearly three in four diagnoses were assigned to males in all countries (range: 68%-73%).

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was the most common comorbidity in all countries, ranging from 48% (Germany) to 70% (Denmark). Psychiatric hospitalization prevalence ranged from 1.2% (Norway) to 12.5% (Germany). Among children and adolescents with CD, the duration of hospitalization ranged from a low in Norway of 226.8 days/1000 children/adolescents to a high in Germany of 5378.0 days/1000. The average hospital stay duration ranged from 2.7 days (US) to 22.3 days (Germany). The most frequent diagnosing physicians were primary care physicians in the US (37%) and Germany (63%) followed by specialist physicians (24 and 13%, respectively; data not available for Denmark and Norway). Conclusions: Prevalence of CD in children and adolescents differ largely between the four Western countries. Despite variability across countries, there is consistent data to suggest a high proportion of psychiatric comorbidity with CD. Variability in antipsychotic use and hospitalization warrant further study to ensure alignment with international consensus on CD management.",0.0,,False

The study did not focus on the clinical consequences of drug interactions, but rather on their potential for occurrence. All patients younger than 18 years-old and taking treatments with two or more drugs at the hospital were included. Results: Eighty patients were included in this study, 59% were male while 41% were female. The most common malignancy type detected was leukemia, particularly acute lymphocytic leukemia, which accounted for 31% of cases. Most of the potential drug-drug interactions (PDDI's) were between anti-neoplastic drugs (54%), where 90% of them were moderate, 4.5.% major, and 4.5.% minor. We observed 33% of PDDI were between non-anti-neoplastic drugs, while 50% were type C, 21.5% type B, 14.2% type A, and 14.2% type D, according to Lexi interact analyzer. DDIs between anti-neoplastic- and non-anti-neoplastic drugs accounted for 14.2% of all DDIs, where 66.6% were type C and 33.3% type D. The most common interaction among anti-neoplastic drugs was detected between Methotrexate-Vincristine (MTX-VCR), which may cause liver complications with moderate severity. MTX was the most common drug involved in DDIs, followed by VCR (both with moderate severity).

About 49% were female, À90% were of unknown race and/or ethnicity, and À60% had >1 year of continuous enrollment. The mean (SD) days from birth to enrollment was 3.3 (35.0) and 84.6 (121.5) days among infants in a mother-infant pair and those not in a pair, respectively. When searching the infant's record alone in the first 28 days, infants were similar regardless of whether they were part of a linked pair. The most common health conditions were low birth weight and gastroesophageal reflux disease (2.5-3.9%; 1.5-3.4%). However, adding the mother's record to the search among paired infants significantly increased evidence of antibiotic and opioid administrations, most medication dispensings (especially antibiotics and glucocorticoids), and 6 of the 22 common health conditions (SMDs À0.15, 0.1-0.5, and 0.1-0.3) in the neonatal period. After the first month, infants paired to mothers had more medication dispensings (SMD À0.2 for antiasthmatics, antibiotics, and glucocorticoids), immunizations (SMD 0.5 for six of the 11), and common health conditions (SMD 0.1-0.2 for allergies, asthma, influenza, otitis, and sinusitis) compared to infants without paired mothers. Prevalence of MCMs recorded in the first year were similar regardless of whether the infant's mother was matched (all SMD< 0.05). Conclusions: We described nearly 2.9 million infants with- and 3.3 million without matched mothers, who were relatively similar in the first 28 days (suggesting little influence from selection bias) but diverged in key health indicators after the neonatal period. Adding the mother's record to searches where available significantly increased capture of some elements but had little impact on others.

In all age groups, ~48% of members were female, and the median (IQR) length of continuous enrollment ranged from 16.9 (7.5- 35.9) to 21.9 (9.5-46.0) months. In their first year, members had four ambulatory encounters and filled three prescriptions on average. Allergies appeared in the top five most frequently observed health conditions in all age groups (1.7-13.8%). Gastroesophageal reflux disease was the most common condition observed in neonates (3.7%) and made the top five among infants/toddlers (8.5%). Otitis (4.835.1%), sinusitis (6.5-8.7%), and asthma (4.0-6.2%) were also common from infancy through early adolescence. Mental health conditions were more common in older ages: attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder was highly evident from 6-21 years (3.5-6.3%), while anxiety (5.7%) and depression (4.6%) surged in late adolescence. The most dispensed prescriptions starting in infancy were antibiotics (27.9-41.4%) and glucocorticoids (11.4-19.5%), while antiasthmatics and antihistamines were common until age 18 (8.3-12.3% and 6.9- 9.7% respectively).

Compared to adult studies, pediatric studies were spread more evenly with respect to both therapeutic area and submission year. Conclusions: FDA approval of NMEs is frequently accompanied by requirements for additional studies, which should be included in lifecycle management strategies. PMC/Rs with pediatric populations tended to have a more similar number of observations across therapeutic areas and by year than adult populations though the number of adult studies was much higher.

6330,"Background: Previous studies have suggested that urinary retention (UR) can induce delirium, which may require the use of antipsychotics. However, antipsychotics have also been reported to worsen UR due to their anticholinergic side effects, which may constitute a vicious circle between UR and the use of antipsychotics. Objectives: To investigate this bidirectional relationship between UR and the use of antipsychotics. Methods: We performed sequence symmetry analyzes using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Database between 2001 and 2012. To evaluate the use of antipsychotics following UR-induced delirium, we selected new users of UR treatments (i.e., alpha-1 antagonists or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors) who initiated antipsychotics within one year before or after UR treatment initiation. We excluded patients with a competing diagnosis to ensure that the use of antipsychotics was for delirium, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and dementia. To assess UR following antipsychotic use, we selected new users of antipsychotics who initiated bethanechol within one year before or after antipsychotic initiation. Patients with a record of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) diagnosis was excluded to ensure that the use of bethanechol was for drug-induced UR. Sequence ratio (SR) was calculated to estimate the temporality of drug pairs (UR treatments - antipsychotics and antipsychotics - bethanechol). We calculated the adjusted SR (aSR) by dividing the crude SR by nulleffect SR to address the prescribing trends. Results: Patients were more likely to initiate antipsychotics after relative to before UR treatment initiation (aSR 1.23, 95% CI 1.21-1.26).

However, a recent study has shown that the use of high dose statin increases the risk of osteoporosis. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the risk of osteoporosis of statins compared with nonuse of statins in patients with dyslipidemia in Korea. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database in Korea from 2011 to 2019. Patients aged  40 years and diagnosed with dyslipidemia (ICD-10, E78) between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015 were enrolled in this study. Statin users were defined as the patients who had at least one prescription of statins (simvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin or pitavastatin). The outcome was osteoporosis. Primary analysis was performed using Cox's proportional hazard model after 1:1 exact matching and 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analyzes were conducted by sex, age groups (40-49, 50-59, 60-69 and 70 years) and statin average daily dose groups (stratified by statin intensity into low, moderate, high). Statin dose was calculated after being converted to atorvastatin equivalent dose. Results: Statin users and non-users were paired using both exact matching and PS matching (462 900 patients per group). After adjustment, statins were associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis compared to non-use of statins (HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.91-0.93) and the results of subgroup analyzes were consistent. Particularly, in the statin dose subgroup analysis, the risk of osteoporosis in statin users compared to non-users was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.95-0.97), 0.88 (95% CI: 0.87- 0.89), and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.72-0.79) in low, moderate and high group respectively, which were statistically significantly lower in all doses. Conclusions: Our study found that statins are significantly associated with lower risk of osteoporosis compared to those of non-use of statins. In particular, as the dose of statins increased, the risk of osteoporosis decreased, confirming a dose-response relationship.",1.0,flu,True

In addition to the peer-reviewed literature we also searched the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website for relevant summary, medical, statistical and pharmacology/ toxicology reviews. Results: Decades of evidence indicate that NMDA receptor blockade produces anesthesia and loss of consciousness at higher doses and an altered state of consciousness at lower doses or as the drug is metabolized and eliminated. In animal studies, the administration of NMDA antagonists is associated with vacuolization in neurons, and then as exposure increases, apoptotic cell death. The most prevalent adverse effect of sub-anesthetic doses or illicit use of NMDA antagonists is the rapid induction of an altered mental state, which can be managed with medical supervision and monitoring and is typically characterized as lasting two hours or less. However, an altered mental state persists beyond this duration in some individuals, and evidence from animal and human studies indicates that frequent use may result in neurotoxicity and cognitive decline. The US FDA approved esketamine for treatmentresistant depression despite several deviations from typical evidentiary thresholds for market access, and clinical studies in humans for the treatment of depression with ketamine or treatmentresistant depression with esketamine have not been adequately designed to characterize toxicity risks or to establish acceptable thresholds for repeat-dose exposures.

Methods: We developed a secondary analysis from the Pharmacovigilance database of EsSalud to calculate the AEFI reporting rate per 100, 000 doses of BBIBP-CorV vaccine. AEFI proportions by gender and age groups were compared. In addition, a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and epidemiologists assessed the potential AESI cases following the Brighton Collaboration case definition using electronic medical records. Finally, we performed a causality assessment or serious AEFI and AESI using the software elaborated by WHO. Results: A total of 4376 AEFI were identified from 216 736 total doses of BBIBP-CorV administered to personnel of EsSalud, corresponding to the 2019 AEFI reporting rate per 100 000 doses.

6388,"Background: Hemorrhage or bleeding is the common manifestation with anti-coagulant therapy. Risk quantification of hemorrhagic profile is essential with extensive use of Direct acting Oral Anti-coagulants (DOACs). Objectives: The main objective of this study is to quantify the risk of bleeding associated with DOACs via disproportionality analysis in US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: The analysis had been carried out by extracting FAERS data pertinent to hemorrahgic events linked with DOACs between October 2010 to September 2020. Disproportionality analysis was performed based on Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The Preferred Terms (PT) such as ""Bleed"", ""Bleeding"", ""Hemorrhage"" and ""Haemorrhage"" were used to search the event of interest. OpenVigil 2.1 was adopted for data retrieval and analysis. Results: A total of 48 425 reports have been identified in the FDA database for PTs. Among which 11 166 (23.05%) reports were on DOACs with Rivaroxaban (12.23%) sharing the maximum percentage followed by Apixaban (5.56%), Dabigatran (5.07%) and Edoxaban (0.17%). DOACs with the highest risk estimates were Rivaroxaban (ROR 13.19, 95% CI 12.8213.56; PRR 12.49, 95% CI 12.16-12.82), Dabigatran (ROR 9.9, 95% CI 9.5-10.32; PRR 9.48, 95% CI 9.11- 9.87) followed by Apixaban (ROR 6.86, 95% CI 6.60-7.14; PRR 6.67, 95% CI 6.42-6.93). Edoxaban exhibited least risk (ROR 4.31, 95% CI 3.47-5.34; PRR 4.23, 95% CI 3.46-5.34). The ROR and PRR were recalculated after removing the concomitant co-administered drugs with DOACs and the signal strength was found to be significant. Conclusions: Among DOACs, Rivaroxaban displayed higher risk of hemorrhage followed by Dabigatran, Apixaban and Edoxaban.

The main indication of HPIs is for basal cell carcinoma. However, the evidence of Gastrointestinal Adverse Events (GIAEs) associated with HPIs is minimal. Objectives: To detect possible safety signals of HPI's associated gastrointestinal associated adverse events through disproportionality analysis in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) Database. Methods: A retrospective case/non-case disproportionality analysis was performed in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, using OpenVigil 2.1 (2012Q2-2021Q3), which is a web-based pharmacovigilance tool. Vismodegib, Sonidegib, and Glasdegib were the drugs used for the analysis. Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) was used as the analysis data mining algorithm. All the Gastrointestinal Adverse Events (GIAEs) that fall under the system organ classification of ""Gastrointestinal disorders"" were used as the events of interest. A value of ROR-1.96SE>1 was considered as the threshold for a signal. Results: The Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitors accounted for 5185 events as per the FAERS database, of which GIAEs were reported in 811, 25, and 3 cases for Vismodegib (17.46%), Sonidegib (8.14%), and Glasdegib (1.28%) respectively. Among the GIAEs, we obtained the highest signals for taste disorder [ROR: 47.1 (95% C.I.: 37.4;59.3)], constipation [5.4 (4.6;6.2)] and epigastric discomfort [4.1 (1.3;12.7)] for Vismodegib, followed by diarrhoea [2.3 (1.4;3.8)] and vomiting [2.5 (1.5;4.2)] for Sonidegib and colitis [10 (3.2;31.3)] for Glasdegib. The pooled GIAE signal strength for Vismodegib [3 (2.8;3.2)] was found to be higher when compared with those of Sonidegib [2.1 (1.4;3.2)] and Glasdegib [10 (3.2-31.3)]. We found the median age for Vismodegib to be 70 (IQR: 19) years, while for Sonidegib and Glasdegib, it was 66 (49) and 69 (20.5), respectively.

Current investigations of the phenomenon involve only limited sample sizes and data reliability. Objectives: We investigate the utility of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) in outlining the traits and trends of drugmediated suicidal acts and estimating lethal dose (LD). Methods: FAERS spontaneous reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (January 2004-September 2021) were retrieved, including cases of ""intentional overdose"" and ""poisoning deliberate"". Drugspecific case-fatality rates (CFR) were calculated for the most reported drugs. Chi-square with Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used to detect significant differences between reports of self-poisoning and other reports. It was also applied within self-poisoning, to highlight differences between non-fatal and fatal cases. Temporal trends and geographical differences were assessed. Finally, the database was used for a proposal of LD estimation, fitting a binomial model to the interpolation of known doses and outcomes. Results: We retrieved 41 103 self-poisoning cases (17% fatal). Compared to other reports, self-poisoning commonly involved young people (p ,"" 0.002: 12% vs 3% < 18 years old -yo-; 24% vs 8% 18-30yo; 36% vs 22% 30-50yo), individuals with psychiatric conditions (p < 0.001: 14% vs 6%) and alcohol consumption (p < 0.001: 5% vs 0%). Fatal cases were more commonly observed in men (p < 0.001: 45 vs 38%), older people (p "","" 0.002: 42% vs 35% 30-50yo; 23% vs 17% 50-65yo), and alcohol exposure (p < 0.001: 9% vs 5%). Drugs implicated were mainly antidepressants (14%), analgesics (11%), and antipsychotics (10%), with paracetamol being the most reported medication in both fatal and non-fatal acts. High CFRs were observed with oxycodone (61%), bupropion (36%), diphenhydramine (35%). Geographical differences were observed, paracetamol being recorded in 60% self-poisoning cases in Ireland, promethazine in 50% in Sweden, metformin in 20% in Turkey. A general increase in selfpoisoning reports was observed in the last two decades. Paracetamol exposure doses were mostly < 100g, with an estimated LD25125g and LD50200g. Paracetamol's CFR was higher when concomitant drugs were recorded (31% vs 16%). Conclusions: The richness, timeliness, and worldwide coverage of the FAERS, along with dose information, complement already accrued knowledge about self-poisoning.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an adverse event associated with this class, the prevalence of which is not well studied in a real-world context. Objectives: To detect the possible safety signal of Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor associated with tumor lysis syndrome through disproportionality analysis in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) Database. Methods: The case/non-case retrospective disproportionality analysis was performed in a publicly available FAERS database using OpenVigil 2.1(2014Q1-2021Q3). The preferred term defined by MedDRA v24 used for the study was ""Tumor lysis syndrome"" and the drugs included in the analysis were Acalabrutinib, ibrutinib, and Zanubrutinib. Proportional reporting ratio (PRR) and Reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used as the analysis data mining algorithm. The threshold for a positive signal was considered as ROR- 1.96SE>1 and PRR>2 with an associated chi-square value of 4 or more. Results: 2852 cases of TLS were identified from FAERS database, of which 121(4.2%) reports were associated with Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Ibrutinib accounted for 103(85%), Acalabrutinib for 15(12%), and Zanubrutinib for 3(2.5%) cases of TLS reports associated with BTKI. The population's median age was 69(63-74) and 71(67-72) for Ibrutinib and Acalabrutinib, respectively. Positive signal strength was obtained for Ibrutinib [ROR 13.5(95% CI: 11.1- 16.4), PRR13.4(Chi-square: 1131.11)], Acalabrutinib[ROR 42.8(25.7- 71.3), PRR 42.3(560.93)] and Zanubrutinib [ROR 72.4(23- 227.5),PRR 70.8(142.53)] associated TLS. On gender stratification, Acalabrutinib and Ibrutinib were found to have a higher value (ROR of 1.69 and 1.73 times, respectively) for females than males.

Objectives: This study aimed to identify adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination in two tertiary health facilities in Lagos State. Methods: A retrospective active surveillance method was used at evaluating the incidence of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) with COVID-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca} as well as its safety. All the 2082 first dose COVISHIELD vaccine recipients in the health facilities used in the study were approached through phone calls to collect data on AEFI. The frequency, duration, severity, and outcome of the adverse reactions were recorded. Incidence of AEFIs in different age groups and gender were analyzed. Presence of any Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) were also evaluated. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Any p-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant Results: Out of the 2082 vaccine recipients, 888 (43%) did not experience any adverse effects while 1194 (57%) vaccine recipients experienced adverse effects. A total of 83 adverse effects were reported and the most frequently reported adverse reactions were headache (30.6%), fever (28.8%) and pain at the injection site (24.3%).

6433,"Background: Dapagliflozin, which launched in Korea in 2013, is Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and its indications and use is expanding. However, safety studies using spontaneous adverse event reporting database for dapagliflozin are insufficient in Korea. Objectives: We aimed to detect potential signals for dapagliflozin using the KAERS database. Methods: We identified adverse events (AEs) reports related to non- insulin anti- hyperglycaemics (ATC code A10B) in the KAERS from 2014 to 2020. The drug of interest was dapagliflozin (ATC code A10BK01) that were conducted post-marketing safety surveillance in the United States (US) and Europe and recently finished re-examination in Korea. We applied disproportionality analysis to detect safety signals and calculated the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and information component (IC). All detected signals were reviewed to determine whether these signals corresponded to known AEs from drug labels in Korea. Additionally, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug labels and risk management plan from European Medicines Agency (EMA) were reviewed to collect data of significant AEs of dapagliflozin and compare with detected signals. Results: We identified 1871 reports related to dapagliflozin and 17 681 reports related to other non-insulin anti-hyperglycaemics from 2014 to 2020.

6437,"Background: Dipeptidyl-peptidase-4(DPP-4) inhibitors are widely used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) because of nonhypoglycemic and weight-neutral effects. However, the risk of acute pancreatitis(AP) in patients with DPP-4 inhibitors is unclear and limited. Previous studies revealed conflicting results between DPP-4 inhibitors' use and the development of AP. Objectives: The aim of our study was to investigate the association between DPP-4 inhibitor and AP by a systematic review of case reports. Case reports clearly demonstrate patient demographics, clinical manifestation, management, and outcome at the individual patient level, which will help to identify the association between DPP-4 inhibitors and AP. Methods: PubMed/Medline and Scopus databases were searched from inception till September 2021 using MeSH terms ""DPP-4 inhibitors"" and ""pancreatitis"" to find case reports on AP induced by DPP-4 inhibitors in T2DM patients. Two independent reviewers were involved in title and abstract screening, full-text screening, data extraction, and quality assessment, disputes were addressed by a discussion with a third reviewer. Microsoft Excel was used for screening and extraction; SPSS version 20.0 was used for statistical analysis.

6443,"Background: QT prolongation can lead to sudden cardiac death following ventricular arrhythmia, and Torsade de Points (TdP). Haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic, can prolong QT interval by blocking the inward potassium rectifier channel in ventricular muscle. QT prolongation is enhanced when there are other risk factors such as coadministration with QT-prolonging drugs. Objectives: To detect a signal of QT prolongation after the combined use of haloperidol and contraindications using the national spontaneous adverse event reports in Korea. Methods: We conducted a case/non-case study using the Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management-Korea adverse event reporting system database (KIDS-KD) between 2016 and 2020. Cases were defined by Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQ) `TdP/QT prolongation', and all reports other than TdP/QT prolongation were defined as non-cases. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and World Health Organization Adverse Reactions Terminology (WHO-ART) were mapped. We selected the list of drugs contraindicated in combined use with haloperidol due to QT prolongation. For comparison, a list of drugs that are not contraindicated in combined use with haloperidol due to QT prolongation was also selected. Reporting odds ratios (ROR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated through logistic regression analyzes. It was considered as a signal if ROR > 2 and the lower bound of 95% CI > 1. Results: During the study period, QT prolongation-related reports defined as cases have been consistently reported at an annual average of about 1700 reports. Among cases including haloperidol, the combined use of haloperidol and contraindicated drugs existed the most (23 out of 31). Of those 23 cases, 15 reports were from male patients aged 65 years or older. Among 23 cases above, the most frequently reported combined use with haloperidol was levofloxacin (21 reports, 91%). The ROR (95% CI) of haloperidol-levofloxacin was 60.19 (26.02-139.23). In addition, the ROR (95% CI) of haloperidolamiodarone and haloperidol-moxifloxacin were 3.84 (0.44-33.8), and 2.39 (0.29-19.66), respectively. Conclusions: The combined use of haloperidol-levofloxacin was detected as a signal.

6445,"Background: Signal detection algorithms are statistical methods used to measure disproportionality and identify signals in adverse drug event (ADE) databases. Many signal detection algorithms give the same weight to information from all products and patients, which may result in signals being masked or false positives being flagged as potential signals. Subgrouped analysis, which is generally used in epidemiology, can be used to help correct for this. This is beneficial in pharmacovigilance to identify potential safety concerns previously missed. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate PRR analyzes subgrouped by either age, sex, ADE report type, seriousness of ADE, or reporter compared to crude PRR analysis. Methods: The publicly available US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) quarterly data extract files from January 1, 2015 through September 30, 2017 were utilized. The Demographic, Drug, Outcome, and Reaction files were used in this study. The files were linked on the primary ID. A deduplication procedure was performed by selecting the highest primary ID for each report. Only the primary suspect drug from a report was included in the analysis. Reports missing a primary suspect drug or that did not list an ADE were excluded. Generic names were used to identify drugs, and all ADEs and drug names were converted to upper case text for standardization. A PRR analysis subgrouped by either age, sex, ADE report type, seriousness of ADE, or reporter was compared to the crude PRR analysis against a reference set. The reference set included 155 drug-ADE pairs from 60 drugs with 110 positive controls and 45 negative controls. A possible signal was defined by the accepted thresholds of PRR  2, number of reports  3, and a  2  4. All drug-ADE pairs in FAERS during the study period were included in the analysis. The sensitivity, specificity, precision, and c-statistic for the PRR analyzes were compared. Results: Subgrouping by age (n ,"" 78, 34.5% increase) and sex (n "","" 67, 15.5% increase) identified the most signals compared to the crude analysis (n "", 58). Subgrouping by report type or seriousness resulted in fewer signals (n ,"" 50 for both). Subgrouping by either age or sex increased both the sensitivity and precision. Subgrouped analyzes had higher c-statistic values, and the age subgrouped analysis had the highest (0.468). Conclusions: Subgrouping by either age or sex increased both the sensitivity and precision compared to the crude PRR analysis, which resulted in identifying a higher percentage of signals that represent true ADEs. Age (children and elderly) and sex (females) increase the risk of a patient experiencing an ADE, and subgrouping by these variables unmask potentially important associations.""",1.0,mask,True

Objectives: To assess the IR of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in adult patients with AD. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the OptumTM ClinformaticsTM Data Mart (CDM). Adult (18+ years) patients with AD were identified from 2014-2019 using 2 claims for AD or 1 claim for AD or eczema and 2 historic claims for asthma, allergic rhinitis, or food allergies. These patients were classified into cohorts 1 (who received systemic therapy, or class 1-2 topical corticosteroids (TCS)), cohort 2 (who received topical TCS class 3-7, calcineurin inhibitors, or crisaborole), and cohort 3 (who received no therapy). Patients with AD were matched with individuals without AD (non-AD cohort 4) on age, sex, and cohort entry date (CED) using risk set sampling. Incident melanoma and NMSC were safety outcomes defined based on one inpatient or two outpatient diagnosis codes. Crude IR and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for each cohort. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CI were generated using Cox regression for cohorts 1-3, compared with cohort 4. Analyzes were completed on the Aetion Evidence Platform® vR4.33.1. Results: Cohorts 1-4 included 297 597, 238 297, 115 988, and 1 245 508 subjects, respectively. The mean age (SD) was similar across cohorts (56.9 ± 18.6 years) and 66.4% were female. Their preenrollment before CED was 6.04 ± 3.19, 5.98 ± 3.21, 5.18 ± 3.02, and 4.44 ± 2.91 years, respectively. Within one year before CED, the proportion of any inpatient hospitalization was 18.2%, 16.8%, 19.4% and 9.1%, respectively. Cardiovascular disease, a risk factor for cancer, was present in 69.6%, 69.6%, 64.2% and 51.1% of cohorts 1 to 4, respectively. The crude IR (95% CI) per 100 person-years were 0.26 (0.21, 0.31), 0.37 (0.30, 0.45), 0.15 (0.14, 0.17), and 0.10 (0.10, 0.10) for melanoma and 2.95 (2.77, 3.13), 4.85 (4.57, 5.14), 1.91 (1.85, 1.97,) and 1.18 (1.16, 1.19), for NMSC, respectively. The most common NMSC was basal cell carcinoma, followed by squamous cell carcinoma. Compared with cohort 4, the adjusted HRs and 95% CI were 2.06 (1.67, 2.54), 2.85 (2.25, 3.61), and 1.30 (1.17, 1.46) for melanoma and 2.02 (1.89, 2.15), 3.38 (3.16, 3.62), and 1.42 (1.37, 1.46) for NMSC, respectively, for cohort 1-3.

6456,"Background: In the past two decades the Gulf region, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia specifically, made more attention to monitor and improve pharmacovigilance activities and risk minimization measures (RMMs). The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) provides RMMs activities on their website for several drugs for both patients and healthcare professionals. The assessment of the effectiveness of RMMs is critically important to ensure that their objectives are fulfilled correctly. This study was designed to synthesize the available studies evaluating RMMs in the Gulf region. Objectives: To systematically review and synthesize the available data and reports on RMMs in the Gulf region. Methods: A systematic search was performed across MEDLINE, Embase, and reference list of retrieved studies to identify eligible reports evaluating RMMs in the Gulf region, regardless of the type of measure and drug studied. Two investigators screened and abstracted the data. Studies were categorizing by study endpoints, research design and data source. Clinical knowledge, clinical Behavior, safety outcomes were considered as the study endpoints. Research designs were categorized into observational and interventional. Data sources were categorized into electronic healthcare databases and chart reviews. Two researchers assessed the quality of each study independently using the ROBINS-I tool. Results: Six eligible studies were included. All the studies were published in Saudi Arabia. The RMMs evaluated were either educational programs or focusing on antibiotics stewardship programs. Two studies assessed clinical Behavior, and four assessed multiple endpoints, three of which included safety outcomes. One study used an observational design, and five studies used interventional non-randomized design. In terms of data sources, all six studies used chart review as the source of data. All six studies reported an improvement in study outcomes when RMMs were implemented. Generally, studies were assessed as having a low to moderate risk of bias. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate the published data on RMMs in the Gulf region. Even though the results of the studies included show a favorable benefit-risk balance using different RMMs, it is hard to specify or quantify the effect of each measure separately. Measuring the effectiveness of the RMMs is a complex task and specifically when studying safety outcomes, which remains the main objective when evaluating RMMs. One possible solution is adopting a framework for future studies planning to evaluate RMMs.",1.0,Clinical,True

Regulatory authorities, including the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA), the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) publish RMMs on their websites. Having consistent measures across regulatory bodies benefits medication use and safety and ultimately the patient. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate whether there is variability in these published RMMs between the three regulatory bodies. Methods: A specific data collection form was created to extract information from the SFDA's RMM list, USFDA's Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) list, and EMA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) list, as of February 2022 all RMMs that were available on the websites were reviewed. Medications with the same trade name were matched across regulators, and unmatched drugs were checked for approval status. For medication groups such as NSAIDs in the SFDA's RMM list, they were matched by searching for the groups individually in the regulatory websites. The details of medication risks and RMM types were extracted from each matched medication in each regulatory authority. All risks and types of minimizing measures were compared. Results: A total of 317 medications were retrieved from the SFDA's RMM list. The majority of medications classes were immunosuppressants (n ,"" 60), antihypertensive (n "","" 33), and oncology medication (n "","" 29). There were only 62 medications with REMS from the USFDA website, a total of 14 medications were approved by the SFDA, and only 9 medications were matched with the SFDA's RMM list. Also, there were 828 medications with RMP from the EMA website, a total of 334 has RMM, 128 are approved by the SFDA, and 71 matched with the SFDA's RMM list. Furthermore, 7 medications were matched between SFDA, USFDA and EMA. After content review, four medications had similar risks and measures across the regulators and three medications had different risks and measures across the regulators. For the medication groups, a total of 36 groups were in the SFDA's list, 17 group were matched with the USFDA, and 19 were matched with the EMA. Overall, differences were found in risks and RMMs types between medication groups across regulators.

However, the safety profile of remifentanil in Indonesian population through post marketing study has not been evaluated yet. Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the safety profiles of remifentanil in a multicenter pharmacovigilance study in Indonesia. Methods: A post marketing study of Remifentanil was conducted in 6 referral hospitals in Indonesia (3 hospitals in Jakarta, 1 hospital in Yogyakarta, 2 hospitals in Surabaya, and 1 hospital in Banjarmasin) during period of June - September 2019. The use of Remifentanil and its adverse events were observed until discharge. The design of this study is a single-arm cohort study that targeted two types of hospitalized patients who were indicated for Remifentanil, which include patients on intubation or invasive mechanical ventilation and patients on Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV). Results: There were 42 patients who used the Remifentanil during the 3 months of observation in 6 referral hospitals in Indonesia, it is found 35 patients (83%) have experienced at least 1 adverse event. There were 54 adverse events recorded during the observations, which are hypotension and bradycardia as most common adverse events, followed by nausea, respiratory depression, dizziness, shivering, warm sensation, and muscle rigidity. Based on the previous safety data, most of these adverse events were recognized as common adverse drug reactions of Remifentanil.

Pharmaceutical professional organizations around the world expressed the willingness and preparedness of pharmacists to be involved in COVID-19 vaccine campaigns. Pharmacists were involved in the organization and popularization of the vaccination process, they also were engaged in the distribution, storage, and preparation of vaccine doses. In many countries, pharmacists have a key role in the safety monitoring of vaccines. However, few countries (Italy, France, UK, USA, Canada, Australia, Brazil, etc.) have reported that pharmacists are allowed to administer vaccines in community pharmacy settings. Some of the barriers to effective pharmacy-led vaccination campaigns include the legislative framework that does not allow pharmacists to administer vaccines independently, the lack of suitable training programs for pharmacists, the need for specific premises and equipment in the pharmacy to provide privacy for the patient, etc. Conclusions: Our findings show that there are some legislative, socioeconomic, pharmacist-and patient-related barriers regarding effective pharmacy-led COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.

Methods: We reviewed matching algorithms used in cohort studies of COVID-19 VE published from 1/1/2021-20/1/2022, considering strengths and limitations of each approach. For our COVID-19 VE study we selected the matching algorithm, which best accounted for calendar time effects. Results: Two broad strategies were used: (a) matching vaccinated group to unvaccinated controls over the entire study period with index dates randomly assigned to controls to match calendar time distribution of vaccination dates in the vaccinated group, or (b) matching by day/week/month all eligible vaccinated participants (including unvaccinated controls who are subsequently vaccinated) to individuals who were unvaccinated at that point in time, ensuring that each matched pair share the same index date (i.e. vaccination date). Option (a) allows conditional exchangeability on selected patient characteristics, but random assignment of index dates in controls does not fully control for effects of calendar time causing potential imbalances for time-dependent factors like NPI and roll-out policies. Option (b) allows for conditional exchangeability in terms of patient characteristics and calendar time. For our COVID-19 VE study we propose an approach where VE estimates are calculated per calendar week in a weekly-matched analysis population. Any decisions to pool VE estimates across time periods can be made following an evaluation of temporal heterogeneity.

Results: Of the 5 295 385 people residing in the jurisdictions, at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose was observed in 1 726 512 people (33%).

Prior to vaccination there was notification to all staff of the hospital through formal letters and information on social media, predominantly through Whatsapp© messages on staff platforms. the Hospital received enough vaccines to vaccinate staff for the first and second round vaccinations. Vaccination status among staff was ascertained using national vaccination cards issued after vaccination. Other information including gender, unit of work, grade, reason for not vaccinating were also captured. Descriptive statistics involved distribution (number and percentage) of the various categories of staff by sex, those with only one vaccination, those with two vaccinations, those with at least one vaccination, and those without any vaccination. Inferential statistics involved both crude and adjusted odds ratios using logistic regression. For logistic regression, a binary variable ""full vaccination vs partial/no vaccination"" was generated. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Stata intercooled version 15 was used for analysis. Results: A total of 240 workers, representing about 96% of pharmacy staff were captured.

6534,"Background: Taiwan's seasonal influenza mass vaccination program was initiated in 1998. This annual program starts in October, targeting individuals at high risk for negative outcomes from influenza infection. The priority groups were expanded to include individuals aged 50+ years in 2016. Few case reports of acute rhabdomyolysis following influenza vaccines in the elderly have raised concerns that the vaccines may rarely cause rhabdomyolysis. Objectives: To evaluate the risk of rhabdomyolysis after influenza vaccination by using case-centered design. Methods: We included individuals enrolled in Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) from 2016 to 2018.",1.0,flu,True
6535,"We identified patients aged 50+ years with all first-ever diagnoses of rhabdomyolysis (ICD-10 code: M62.82) and defined a case as patient who received at least one influenza vaccine within 365 days before the diagnosis. We defined the date of diagnosis as the index date for the case, and selected risk interval of 0 to 28 days. Each case patient was matched by sex and age (+/-2 years) to the entire NHIRD population who, as of the same index date, received influenza vaccine within the previous 365 days. The observed odds of cases vaccinated inside (0 to 28 days) vs outside (29 to 365 days) the risk interval was compared with the expected odds derived from the matched population vaccinated inside vs outside the risk interval. The odds ratio (OR) was estimated by stratified logistic regression. Different length of risk intervals, including 0 to 7 and 0 to 14 days before the index date, were examined to evaluate the robustness of the results. Results: We identified 2527 cases of rhabdomyolysis with a mean age of 71.7 years (SD, 11.4) (67% male) and 5 632 174 vaccinated enrollees of the same age and sex. The median time from vaccination to onset of rhabdomyolysis was 28 weeks (IQR, 14-40). Compared to the matched population, we found the OR of receiving influenza vaccine during the risk interval of 0 to 28 days was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.52- 0.82) for the cases. The decrease in ORs remained consistent for the various risk intervals of 0 to 7 days (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.29-0.68) and 0 to 14 days (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-0.83). Conclusions: Risk of rhabdomyolysis was not increased during the 28 days after influenza vaccination in the elderly in Taiwan. Instead, a reduced risk was observed and might be explained by the healthy vaccinee effect, or the protection of influenza-induced rhabdomyolysis from vaccination.",1.0,case,True

Objectives: To estimate the incidence rate (IR) of 17 AESI as historical comparators and 3 negative controls. Methods: We used five administrative claims databases during the study period, January 1, 2019-December 11, 2020: Medicare claims for adults aged 65 years and commercial claims (Blue Health Intelligence® [BHI®], HealthCore Integrated Research Database, IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Database, and Optum pre-adjudicated claims) for adults aged 18-64 years. We estimated the IR of 17 AESI and 3 negative control events, overall and by sex, age, race/ethnicity (Medicare), and nursing home residency status (Medicare) in 2019. We also estimated monthly IRs in 2020 to assess the pandemic's impact on observed rates. IR was defined as the number of incident events among eligible individuals divided by their accumulated person-time during a specific period. Results: The study population included over 70 million enrollees annually. In 2019, rates of most AESI and all negative control events increased with age. Compared with those aged 18- 64 years, Medicare enrollees had lower IRs per 100 000 person-years for anaphylaxis (11 vs 14-19), appendicitis (80 vs 119-155), narcolepsy (38 vs 44- 53), and well-care visits (47 877 vs 53 470-69 730). Rates were higher in males than females for most AESI across databases; in Medicare, rates varied by race/ethnicity and nursing home residency status. We observed seasonal patterns for acute myocardial infarction (Medicare) and anaphylaxis (all databases). Although IRs of most AESI across databases were lower in March-May 2020 compared with the same months in 2019, many rates returned to near pre-pandemic levels after May 2020. However, rates of Guillain-Barré syndrome, Bell's palsy, narcolepsy, hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic stroke, and transverse myelitis remained lower in several databases. In contrast, anaphylaxis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, myocarditis/pericarditis, pulmonary embolism, and common and unusual-site thrombosis with thrombocytopenia exhibited higher rates than pre-pandemic levels in some databases after May 2020. Conclusions: AESI background rates varied by database and demographics and fluctuated during the peri-COVID-19 period. It is critical to select a comparable period and standardize demographics for background rates from the same database when comparing them with post-vaccination AESI rates to evaluate safety signals.",1.0,negative,True

Objectives: To describe the association between occurrence and severity of COVID-19 reported cognitive symptoms and loss of sense of taste and/or smell in participants reporting a positive COVID-19 test result in a direct-to-participant registry. Methods: Registry data from the COVID-19 Active Registry Experience (CARE) were analyzed for participants who reported having tested for COVID-19 from December 15, 2020 to December 13, 2021. Community-based social media recruitment targeted adult US residents (non-hospitalized at enrollment). Enrollment and followup surveys collected information on participants' demographics, medical history, COVID-19-like symptoms and severity, COVID-19 tests and vaccination, and use of medications and supplements. Cognitive symptoms were characterized as ""feeling disoriented or having trouble thinking"" or reports of related symptoms. Associations between cognitive and other neuropsychiatric symptoms were examined. Results: Of 13 501 CARE participants, 3908 reported positive and 2537 negative COVID-19 test results. Cognitive symptoms were reported among 1014 (26%) and 142 (6%) participants testing positive and negative, respectively. Among the COVID positive participants, 1726 (44%) reported a change in taste and 1864 (48%) reported change in smell. Of 2894 COVID-positive participants who reported no cognitive symptoms, 26.4% reported moderate or severe changes in taste and 31.7% reported moderate or severe changes in smell.

Objectives: To describe real-world evidence generation activities implemented by EMA from the early pandemic through national vaccination campaigns, and to discuss lessons learned. Methods: Selected EMA-tendered studies addressing various research questions were assessed using a common structure: objectives, stakeholders, data sources, design, key findings, methodological and operational challenges, learnings, impact. Results: Early activities supported the generation of background incidence rates, while pharmacoepidemiological studies on the association between EU-authorized vaccines and several safety and effectiveness outcomes generated data that continue to contribute to the collective evidence supporting the benefit-risk profile of COVID19 vaccines. Findings highlighted the need for large data sources providing recent exposure, outcome and covariate data; the importance of harmonizing methods and understanding their limitations; the challenges related to fast changes in vaccine use and disease epidemiology; the need for rapid turnaround studies; and the challenges to assess the impact of rapid regulatory actions. Conclusions: Preparedness in the context of a public health emergency is key to develop a framework for agile monitoring of therapeutics and vaccines, able to adapt to a changing environment.

The composite influenza outcome was defined as hospital admission for influenza or influenza-like illness diagnosed in primary care. We estimated associations between statin-use at the time of vaccination and risk of influenza using Cox regression. We adjusted for observed confounding bias by inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) on the propensity score for receipt of statins. We also used influenza events in statin users and non-users in the previous influenza season to help assess the degree of confounding bias from unobserved sources. Results: Preliminary results from pilot work using IPTW to account for observed confounders did not suggest an increased risk of influenza among new statin-users following vaccination (HR 0.83, 95% confidence interval: 0.67, 1.02) compared to statin-free patients. Further analysis is being conducted using the prior event rate ratio method to account for unmeasured confounding bias, with careful consideration to testing the plausibility of the assumptions. Conclusions: Adjustment for observed covariates of flu risk, alone, in health registry data is insufficient to account for all confounding bias.

Followed by Zoster, Seasonal Influenza, Pneumococcal, and Human papillomavirus vaccines. Conclusions: The large data available in VARES make it a useful tool for detecting and monitoring vaccine AEFIs. However, its usability relies on understating the limitations of this surveillance system, the impact of governmental regulations, availability of vaccines, and public health recommendations on the reporting rate. Promoting VARES effectiveness and highlighting the significance of accurate reporting could improve AEFIs post marketing monitoring processes.",1.0,COVID-19,True

6589,"Background: The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most prevalent viral infection of the reproductive tract and one of the most common sexually transmitted infections globally. As a preventive strategy, three HPV vaccines have been approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration and recommended by the World Health Organization. Since their approval from 2006 and 2009, several interventions have been implemented to increase HPV vaccine uptake in Africa. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions implemented to improve HPV vaccine uptake in Africa, measured by two outcomes namely: changes in vaccine uptake or changes in knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions about the HPV vaccine. Methods: A search strategy was developed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria using the PICO framework. Four databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO) were searched for relevant articles published between 2006 and 2021. Articles were screened and included based on eligibility criteria using DistillerSR (Version 2.35). Studies conducted in Africa that reported the quantitative and/or qualitative outcomes of HPV vaccine interventions implemented within this time frame were included. Data were extracted and reported using a narrative synthesis. A quality appraisal was conducted for each study using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP), Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), Appraisal Tool for Cross-sectional Studies ((AXIS) or Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality appraisal tool. Results: Out of 7603 articles produced by a systematic search, 18 articles met the inclusion criteria. Studies were published between 2012",1.0,vaccine,True

Interventions comprised fifteen educational interventions and three multicomponent interventions. All multicomponent interventions were effective in increasing HPV vaccine uptake and improving participants' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions towards the vaccine. Fourteen out of fifteen educational interventions were considered effective in achieving both outcomes. No clear difference in the effectiveness of interventions was observed between countries. Based on the quality appraisal, two studies had a strong quality, twelve studies were of moderate quality, and four studies had a weak quality. Conclusions: Educational and multicomponent interventions have been effective at improving HPV vaccine uptake in Africa. A more diverse range of interventions conducted with thorough and robust methodologies are necessary to strengthen the available evidence and inform further action to improve vaccine uptake.",1.0,vaccine,True

Objectives: Describe the rate of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in the United States based on mRNA-1273 vaccination or no COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 test (RT-PCR or antigen) outcomes within the US CVS Health retail pharmacy network test population were collected between 25 April 2021 and 29 January 2022; self-reported demographic, health information, COVID-19 vaccination status, vaccine identity, and primary series completion date were also collected. Test data were analyzed based on vaccination status; breakthrough infections were defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in mRNA1273-vaccinated individuals 14 days after completing the 2-dose primary series. Participants vaccinated with other COVID-19 vaccines were excluded. Results: Overall, 23 010 347 SARS-CoV-2 tests were performed (unvaccinated, n ,"" 9 415 865 [40.9%]; 2-dose mRNA-1273, n "","" 4 132 953 [18.0%]), of which there were 1 412 239 SARS-CoV2-positive cases (15.0%) in unvaccinated individuals and 332 202 breakthrough cases (8.0%). At the nadir of the pandemic (May 2021), SARS-CoV-2 test positivity rates were 0.6% and 5.7% among mRNA1273 vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, respectively. During the delta (July and August 2021) and omicron (December 2021 and January 2022) periods, peak SARS-CoV-2 test positivity rates were 20.4% and 35.1% among unvaccinated individuals, respectively; the corresponding peak breakthrough infection rates were 4.8% and 24.9%, respectively. Notably, for both delta and omicron periods, rapid weekly increases in SARS-CoV-2 test positivity were observed in the weeks preceding the peak. Conclusions: These findings highlight that increases in SARS-CoV-2 test positivity rates within the US CVS Health retail pharmacy network test population may be a useful predictor for surges in SARSCoV-2 infections during the COVID-19 pandemic. The higher rate of breakthrough infections during omicron vs delta could indicate higher transmissibility of omicron, waning vaccine effectiveness, or the ability of omicron to evade vaccine-induced immunity.

6609,"Background: Hypoesthesia is also known as numbness, which corresponds to the loss of normal feeling or sensation. Several factors are associated with the occurrence of hypoesthesia such as spine/spinal cord disorder, diabetes, anxiety, depression, or neuropathy causing nerve dysfunction, and muscle and vascular diseases. In December 2020, Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was conditionally authorized by the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) to combat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objectives: To assess the potential risk of hypoesthesia with the use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: A descriptive analysis was conducted of all hypoesthesia reported cases associated with the use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. On January 21, 2021, a search was conducted in the World Health Organization (WHO) database (VigiBase) to retrieve all the reported cases between 2019 and 2021 using the terms ""COVID-19 vaccine"" OR ""Comirnaty"" OR ""COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2"" OR ""Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine"" [AND] ""Hypoaesthesia"" OR ""Numbness"". Moreover, a search was conducted in the local adverse reactions database of the National Pharmacovigilance Center in Saudi Arabia to retrieve the reported cases locally. Then, the causality assessment of the cases was performed using the WHO-Uppsala Monitoring Center causality system. Results: The search in VigiBase revealed 526 case-reports of hypoesthesia reported with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The top 30 ICSRs with the highest completeness score were included in the analysis. The mean age was 40 years (range 22-58) and the majority of the cases were reported with females (80%). In all the cases, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was reported as the only suspected agent. The outcome of the majority of the cases was reported as recovered (73%). In addition, 14 cases of hypoesthesia were identified in the local database and were included in the analysis. The mean age was 36.1 years (range 30-80) and the majority of the cases were reported with females (64%). In all the cases, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was reported as the only suspected agent. The outcome of the majority of the cases was not reported. Overall, all the reported cases had no history nor any risk factors of hypoesthesia. The time to onset in all the included cases ranged between 1-2 days after vaccination, which showed a reasonable temporal relationship. The causality assessment showed that all the cases were possibly related to the vaccine except for 2 cases that were unassessable due to insufficient information. Conclusions: The study shows a possible association between hypoesthesia and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

Objectives: Assess the impact of COVID-19 boosters on protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a real-world setting from a highly vaccinated (99%) population curated from a linked database with test results, vaccination history, patient demographics, and genomic sequencing information from the National Basketball Association (NBA). Methods: In this population, 1613 fully vaccinated staff and players (median age 34.5 years, 88% male) who tested at least once between 1 December 2021 and 5 January 2022, were analyzed. Individuals were tested at the time of reporting any symptom, regardless of severity, after known exposure per self-report or contact tracing and/or during enhanced surveillance.

Methods: Social media outlets were used to enroll adult volunteers in the US who believed they had been exposed to or tested positive for COVID-19, and/or received a COVID-19 vaccine(s) (www. helpstopCOVID19.com). We identify and describe 678 diabetic and 6288 non-diabetic participants who reported having received a full regimen of COVID-19 vaccine (1 dose of J&J, 1 or 2 doses of Pfizer, 1 or 2 doses of Moderna) and reported at least 1 side effect they attributed to the vaccine.

However, real-world safety profiles of novel vaccine platforms, mRNA vaccines, still need to be intensified. Objectives: To identify overall trends and factors associated with participants-reported adverse events (AEs) following mRNA COVID19 vaccination. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, web-based survey from December 2 to 10 in 2021 with a 2849 nationwide sampled panel. Study participants were individuals who had elapsed at least two weeks after completing two dosing schedules of COVID-19 vaccination among 18 to 49 years of adults. We weighted the study sample by demographic characteristics (sex, age, and regions) to be representative of the Korean population. The outcome was overall trends of participantsreported AEs following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination and associated factors. Severe adverse events were defined if the participant responded to a hospital visit or hospitalization due to an adverse event. We estimated weighted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CI using multivariable logistic regression models to identify factors associated with AEs. Results: Of 2849 participants (median [IQR] age, 35 [27-42] years; 51.6% male), 90.8% for the first dose and 88.7% for the second dose, reported any AEs, and 3.3% and 4.3% reported severe AE, respectively. Compared to BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), AEs and severe AEs following mRNA-1273 (Moderna) were generally higher after the first dose (93.5% vs. 89.9% for any AEs; 4.8% vs. 2.9% for severe AEs) and the second dose (95.0% vs. 87.0% for any AEs; 5.8% vs. 3.9% for severe AEs). There were four cases of myocarditis or pericarditis and one case of anaphylaxis requiring admission or emergency department visit. Occurrence of any AEs was more prevalent in mRNA-1273 (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.59-2.67 versus BNT162b2), the first dose (1.22; 1.02-1.47), female sex (1.88; 1.52-2.32), and those with dermatologic diseases (2.51; 1.32-4.77).

Despite the several studies related association of influenza vaccine and stroke, few studies were performed for Asian elderly. A large study based on a national population is needed to provide clear evidence of an association between influenza vaccine and stroke risk in Asians. Objectives: We aimed to confirm whether influenza vaccination is associated with stroke for the elderly population in Korea using a large-scale national database. Methods: We identified patients who had one or more stroke hospitalization episodes from September 1, 2017 to October 30, 2018 using a large-linked database of vaccination registration data from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency and the National Health Insurance Service claims data. The cases were restricted to those who received only one influenza vaccine between September 1, 2017 and April 30, 2018 (17/18 season), and patients who experienced a stroke on same or before their vaccination date was excluded. We defined stroke patients as only those who had both the ICD-10 code (I60, I61, I63) and the related operation code. Using the self-controlled case series (SCCS) study design, we followed up patients for 6 month (180 days) from the days of vaccination. The risk period and control period was defined as 1 to 14 days and 15 to 180 days following vaccination, respectively. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) between the risk period and the control period was calculated. Results: A total of 4316 elderly aged 65 years or older were identified who were firstly diagnosed with a stroke following vaccination during the observation period. Most of them were vaccinated between September and December (98.3%). There were 324 (7.5%) patients who had a stroke within 14 days after vaccination and the follow-up period was 164.8 and 1579 person-years for the patients of riskperiod and control-period, respectively. The risk of stroke was significantly reduced by 22% in the risk-period compared to the controlperiod (IRR 0.78, 95% Confidence interval 0.70-0.87; p-value < 0.001).

6632,"Background: Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for the general population including the elderly. Recent prior studies suggested an association between the influenza vaccine and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Objectives: To determine the association between influenza vaccine and the risk of AMI in Korean elderly the 2017/2018 flu season. Methods: We defined the 2017/2018 season were September 1, 2017, to April 30, 2018. The AMI patients identified who were diagnosed with AMI (ICD-10: I21) inpatients and received related procedure codes after influenza vaccination. We included patients in the 2017/2018 season who were over-aged 65 at the vaccination date. We excluded those who had a history of AMI-related disease (ICD10: I21-I25) or persons who infected with influenza within 28 days of confirmed AMI. We performed the self-controlled case series (SCCS) design with a risk interval of 1 to 14 days and an observation period of 180 days postvaccination and calculated the incidence rate ratio (IRR). The IRR was calculated by comparing the risk of AMI in the risk interval versus the risk in the control interval within the observation period using conditional Poisson regression analysis. Results: We identified 2101 AMI events during the observation period. The number of events in the risk interval was 150 and the number of events in the control interval was 1951. As a result, the incidence rate in the risk interval was 1.88 per 100 000 person-year, and in the control interval was 2.85 per 100 000 person-year. The IRR was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.56-0.78) in the interval 1-14 days following vaccination compared to the control interval. Conclusions: This nationwide study found that influenza vaccination was associated with AMI benefits in the elderly. Therefore, our study indicates the safety of the influenza vaccine and the benefit of the national immunization program. However, Because our study is limited to only one flu season, further studies using subsequent flu seasons are necessary.",1.0,flu,True

Despite availability and uptake of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and corresponding decrease in disease, PD, including IPD, remains a global health problem. Emergence of non-vaccine serotypes contributes to the burden of PD. Objectives: As part of an ongoing program, we performed a systematic literature review to inform changes in serotype distribution globally. Methods: Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched from March 2015 to May 2021 to identify real-world studies from all geographic regions. Serotype distribution data for children <5 years were extracted and summarized. Serotype prevalence was calculated from pooled data and reported as the proportion of the total number of isolates summarized globally, by region and by disease type. Results: Serotype data were available in 189 articles covering varying periods from 2011 onwards, including 94 909 isolates. Nearly onethird (31.7%) of articles reported data from Europe, 28.0% from Asia Pacific, 28.0% from Africa/Eastern Mediterranean, 9.0% from North America and 4.8% from Latin America. The majority (149 publications) were from areas/periods where pediatric PCV has been introduced. Most papers (101) covered nasopharyngeal carriage, 84 covered IPD, 6 covered acute otitis media (AOM) and 1 covered non-invasive pneumonia; 6 reported on IPD and non-IPD combined. Overall, PCV13 and non-PCV serotypes accounted for 28.8% and 34.6% of serotyped isolates, respectively; the remaining isolates were reported as mixtures, `other' or untypeable. Seven of the 10 most prevalent serotypes were PCV13-specific. Globally, the most prevalent non-PCV serotypes were 15B/C (5.3%), 11A (2.8%), 23B (2.4%), 10A (2.2%), 15A (1.8%), 35B (1.7%), 12F (1.5%), 16F (1.5%) and 23A (1.5%). The most common non-PCV serotypes were 15B/C, 23B, 11A, 12F, 10A in Europe; 15B/C, 15A, 23A, 35B, 11A in Asia Pacific; 15B/C, 10A, 13, 16F, 35B in Africa/Eastern Mediterranean; 15B/C, 22F, 35B, 33F, 11A in North America; 6C, 11A, 23B, 15A, 15B/C, 10A in Latin America. Globally, non-PCV serotypes accounted for 31.6% of IPD isolates, 11.7% of non-invasive pneumonia isolates, 31.1% of AOM isolates and 37.2% of nasopharyngeal carriage isolates. Conclusions: Pneumococcal disease in children due to PCV serotypes remains a significant burden even in countries using PCV. Furthermore, additional non-PCV serotypes that contribute to PD burden are emerging.

PD, especially in older adults, remains a global health problem despite availability of vaccines, including pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPV23) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV). PCV introduction led to a decrease in the prevalence of PD due to vaccine type serotypes; however, PD due to non-vaccine serotypes increased. Objectives: We performed a systematic literature review to monitor changes in serotype distribution as part of ongoing surveillance and to maintain an understanding of the causes of PD Methods: Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched from March 2015 to May 2021 to identify real-world studies from all geographic regions. Serotype distribution data for adults 65 years were extracted and summarized. Serotype prevalence was calculated from pooled data and reported as the proportion of the total number of isolates summarized globally, by region and by disease type. Results: Serotype data were available in 50 articles covering time periods from 2011 onwards, including 58 593 isolates. More than half (52.0%) of articles reported data from Asia Pacific, 34.0% from Europe, 10.0% from North America, 2.0% from Africa/Eastern Mediterranean and 2.0% from Latin America. The majority of studies were from areas where pediatric PCV has been introduced. Forty articles covered invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), 6 reported on non-invasive pneumonia and 5 reported on IPD and non-IPD combined. No eligible studies were found on nasopharyngeal carriage or acute otitis media. Overall, PCV13, PPV23-specific and non-vaccine serotypes accounted for 20.3%, 26.3% and 11.9% of serotyped isolates, respectively; the remaining isolates were reported as mixtures, `other' or untypeable. Serotypes 3 (8.4%), 19A(5.4%) and 7F (1.8%) were the most prevalent PCV serotypes whereas 22F (7.6%), 8 (5.6%) and 12F (2.9%) were the most common non-PCV serotypes. The most common serotypes were 3, 19A, 6C, 19F, 22F in Asia Pacific; 8, 3, 22F, 12F, 19A in Europe; 22F, 3, 19A, 7F, 11A in North America; 1, 4, 19A in Africa/Eastern Mediterranean; 3, 19A, 6C, 6A in Latin America. Overall, PCV13 serotypes accounted for 19.4% of IPD isolates and 28.8% of non-invasive pneumonia isolates. Conclusions: Even after PCV adoption in various countries, several PCV and non-PCV serotypes remain a significant source of burden among older adults.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using an online survey in Saudi Arabia from 19 October to 22 November 2021. A convenience sample of eligible participants was used to recruit the study participants. A total of 3486 responders from different regions in Saudi Arabia were included in the final analysis. Participants were invited to participate in this study through social media (Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram). The study sample were invited using a survey link. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software, version 27 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages Results: The participants' characteristics in our study showed that 69.9% were female, and 57.8 % had bachelor's degrees. Besides, our study showed that 76.3% of the participants received the same generic type of vaccine in the first and second doses. In addition, 43.7% of the study participants were neutral or unsure about the general concept of mixing different generic types of COVID-19 vaccine due to the safety issue.

Database records demographic data, pharmacy dispensing claims, outpatient healthcare encounters as well as hospital admissions with primary, secondary and associated ICD10 diagnoses. A cohort of SLE patients was identified over an 11-year period (first January 2008- 3first December 2018). Cases were SLE patients who experienced a SLE flare-up during the study period, ascertained using either a new pharmacy dispensing claim for high-dose corticosteroid within 7 days, emergency room visit or hospitalization with SLE-related primary discharge diagnosis. Vaccine exposure in the 2 months prior to the flareup date (risk window) was compared to prior exposure in up to 4 control time windows per patient - each control window was 2 months. Conditional logistic regression with Generalized Estimating Equation models were used to measure the association between vaccination and flareup accounting for the occurrence of multiple flare-ups within an individual, healthcare use, and seasonality. Stratifications by vaccine type (bacterial, viral, combination) or nature (antigenic, live attenuated), demographic characteristics, number of flare-ups, time since SLE diagnosis, and disease activity were performed. Results: A total of 45 178 SLE patients with 148 839 flare-ups were identified. Patients' mean age was 41.6 years [SD16.4] and 86.2% were females. 69.2% were vaccinated at least once during the study period, distributed as follows: vaccine combinations (47.0%), flu (28.3%), pneumococcus (23.2%), hepatitis B (5.2%) and others (< 4%).

6659,"safety study (PASS) in the United States in a rapidly changing COVID19 environment. Methods: This PASS uses primarily claims data from partners in the Sentinel System, with a source population of ~65 million people. Three study designs were considered: cohort design with concurrent unexposed comparators, cohort design with historical unexposed comparators, and self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) design. The potential for incomplete capture of COVID-19 vaccines in claims (which could lead to misclassification of unexposed status) and the potential for high vaccine uptake in the study population (which could lead to small numbers of unexposed comparators) were critical design considerations. Other key exposure-related considerations were the multidose primary vaccination schedule, added booster doses, prioritizing of high-risk groups, and changing vaccine eligibility criteria over time. Key outcome-related factors were changing healthcare utilization during the pandemic, relatively limited knowledge of the safety profile at study initiation, and emerging safety signals. Results: The study is planned to use a cohort design with unexposed comparators as it is appropriate for both acute and nonacute events. Concurrent rather than historical comparators were chosen because changes in healthcare utilization during the pandemic could impact outcome ascertainment. Confounding will be addressed by matching exposed to unexposed comparators on time-specific propensity scores. Before final analysis, the study will assess counts of unvaccinated individuals over time to confirm the feasibility of using concurrent unexposed comparators. Completeness of COVID-19 vaccine data will also be assessed before final analysis by comparing vaccine coverage estimates in data sources to estimates from public health authorities. Sensitivity analysis will incorporate a SCRI design and a cohort design with historical comparators to address potential misclassification of unexposed status. Conclusions: Flexibility is critical in designing this PASS for PfizerBioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine using real-world data. Although a cohort design with concurrent unexposed comparators is planned, the primary study design may be converted to SCRI (for acute events) and cohort design with historical comparators (for nonacute events) if vaccine capture is incomplete or if there are insufficient concurrent unexposed comparators.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Study population was enrolled from the vaccination center of a tertiary care hospital after the informed consent during their first dose vaccination visit. All the enrolled participants were followed telephonically after each dose of vaccines (visit 1: 8 ± 2 and Visit 2: 28 ± 2 days). Collected data were analyzed and categorized by severity and seriousness. The causality assessment team performed causality assessment of the AEFIs using the World Health Organization's causality assessment algorithm. Bivariate analysis was used as the statistical tool (confidence interval of 95%) for the identification of predictors of AEFI. Results: A total of 43037 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (COVISHIELDTM - 14131, COVAXINTM- 28906) were administered at the study site during the study period. A total of 694 AEFIs were reported from 496 subjects with an incidence rate of 0.99%. Incidence of AEFIs were less with COVAXINTM (0.25%). 86.02% of reported events were expected as per the fact sheets issued by the manufacturers. 62.02% AEFIs were observed at the system organ class of `General disorders and administration site conditions'. After the causality assessment, 94.22% events were categorized to have `consistent causal association with immunization'. 98.02% of the study population recovered from their adverse events without any sequelae. Adult age group (18-45 years), co-morbidities and first dose was the identified predictors for AEFIs. Conclusions: Active vaccine safety surveillance helps health care professionals to identify rare events and potential signals. The incidence rate was less and events were mild in severity.

As sequential analyzes, we used SCRI design with the binomial-based maxSPRT to estimate log-likelihood ratio weekly in each season. The endpoint of surveillance was set when the signal was detected, maximum sample size was reached, or the season ended. Then we compared to the result of sequential and non-sequential methods in terms of the direction and the time of signal detection. Results: We identified 3 715 453 elderly who received influenza vaccines. For CW1, the risk of anaphylaxis in RW was statistically significant in 2016/17 season (IRR ,"" 1.98, 95% CI "", 1.04-3.79) and 2017/18 season (IRR ,"" 2.22, 95% CI "","" 1.20-4.10), excluding 2015/16 season. However, the risk of anaphylaxis was not significantly increased when using CW2.

Data regarding vaccination coverage and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained using King Saud University Medical City databases and Health Electronic Surveillance Network (HESN) platform. Exposure: Time-varying vaccination status (categorized as: unvaccinated, vaccinated first dose, and vaccinated second dose) were measured. We only included Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome of interest was a confirmed positive polymerase chain result test for SARS-CoV-2. A generalized linear model with a Poisson distribution was used to estimate the incidence of the infection. Results: Among 66 775 participants included, 2615 SARS-CoV-2 infections were observed. The sample was relatively young with average age of 25 years and 43% female. The incidence rate of SARSCoV-2 infections among unvaccinated was 46 per 100 000 personyears. A single dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had 40% effectiveness. The vaccine effectiveness doubled after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech (80%). The time between the first and second dose appears to be crucial after observing 75%, 90% and 85% effectiveness with early vaccination, on-time vaccination, and delayed vaccination, respectively. Conclusions: For Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine recipients in Saudi Arabia, higher effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 was observed with two doses of the vaccine. The timing of the second dose of the vaccine appears to be a dominant factor to the extent of protection against SARS-CoV-2.",1.0,SARS-CoV-2,True

6685,"Objectives: To assess capacity for identifying health insurance plan enrollees with Janssen Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccination within 4 US health insurance databases in preparation for an observational post-authorization safety study (PASS). Methods: Research partners provided A26.COV2.S counts of vaccinees in May 2021, which included demographic characteristics of vaccinees and source of exposure information as recorded in claims. Partners also provided monthly counts from October 2021 through January 2022 and responded to surveys in May 2021 and November 2021. The surveys included information regarding COVID-19 vaccine capture and timeliness in claims data, and potential linkages to states' Immunization Information Systems (IISs). Results: In May 2021, we identified 350 532 enrollees with Ad26. COV2.S vaccination in claims data; of these 51% were female, 47% were 18-49 years, 36% were 50-64 years, and 17% were 65 years. Vaccine administrations were most commonly recorded in claims with national drug codes (58%) followed by vaccine administration codes (30%); 11% of enrollees had multiple sources of information. The majority of vaccination claims (approximately 77%) were recorded in outpatient settings; 17% had no setting identified, 5% occurred in other settings, and only 1% were captured in mass vaccination settings. Pharmacy claims had the shortest lag time (À1 month) and inpatient claims the longest (À6 months). As of the November 2021 survey, 2 of 4 partners were conducting linkage with IISs in 9 states and negotiating with 14 others. Timing and frequency of IIS linkage varied by partner and IIS, but typically occurred either monthly or weekly. The ability to incorporate IIS records into databases is still being determined. By January 2022, we identified 566 891 enrollees with Ad26. COV2.S vaccination. Conclusions: As the extent of missing COVID-19 vaccine information in claims is still unknown, the potential for exposure misclassification should be considered in the design of vaccine safety studies. An active comparator design and a self-controlled risk interval design are planned to be used in this US PASS to overcome potential misclassification of unexposed vaccination status.

Methods: We prospectively evaluated the `Institutional COVID Vaccination Database' to categorize the SARS-CoV-2 positive healthcare workers into 2 cohorts: infected vaccinated and infected unvaccinated cohort. Along with comparing the descriptive statistics of the cohorts, the relative risk (RR), relative risk reduction (RRR), and the vaccine effectiveness were calculated. The study population was compared for the significant difference by using the parametric model (binary logistic regression) for the Odds ratio and the non-parametric model (cox proportionality model) for the Hazard ratio. Results: Out of the 324 healthcare workers employed in our institution 243 (75%) were vaccinated. When 6.58% (16) of the vaccinated healthcare workers were tested positive, 43.75% (35) were infected in the unvaccinated cohort and the median time of infection in the vaccinated cohort was 65 days (range 20-91 days). While the cox proportionality model reveals that the age, sex, and the contact exposure status of the cohort are not significant factors for getting infected after being vaccinated, binary logistic regression proves that a significant relationship exists between the incidence of infection and the unvaccinated status (p ,"" 0.001, OR "","" 4.278).

COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are well-tolerated and effective against COVID-19 variants, although adverse events e.g., myocarditis and pericarditis occur. This novel vaccine technology stimulates the immune system differently to conventional vaccines, thus may elicit different undesired effects in immunocompromised people. Objectives: To determine differences in age, sex, severity, time-toonset, and vaccine dose in spontaneous reports (SR) of myocarditis/ pericarditis from immunocompromised people versus the overall population, following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. Methods: Myocarditis/pericarditis SR following any dose of Pfizer/ BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccine were obtained for immunocompromised and overall database populations, using systematic searches of SR systems from the European Union (EU; EudraVigilance), United States (US; Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System [VAERS]) and United Kingdom (UK; data provided by Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency). Data were stratified by age, sex, time-to-onset, seriousness of reported events, and vaccine dose. Proportional reporting rates (PRR) were calculated where feasible. Results: Myocarditis/pericarditis predominantly affected younger males in the overall population, whereas in immunocompromised people this distribution broadened and no clear trend in age/sex was observed.

Mapping the knowledge build-up on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and the time frame in which regulatory authorities have taken safety concerns into consideration is important from the viewpoint of providing timely information and transparency for different stakeholders. Objectives: Describing both the safety concerns of COVID-19 vaccines for which a PI update was recommended by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and safety concerns that were considered by the PRAC without being labeled in the PI. Additionally, this study also had the objective to map the time frame in which the safety concerns were considered by the PRAC. Methods: The safety concerns were extracted from the publicly available safety updates on the EMA website, published between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021, for the following centrally authorized COVID-19 vaccines: Comirnaty®, Spikevax®, Vaxzevria® and COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen®.

Objective: To detect possible adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: Enrollees in the Vaccine Safety Datalink's 8 sites receiving  1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine in 2021 were followed for 70 days after Dose 1 of Pfizer or Moderna and 56 days after Janssen vaccination. Incident diagnoses in inpatient or emergency department settings were analyzed for clustering within both the hierarchical ICD-10 code structure and the post-vaccination follow-up period. We used the self-controlled tree-temporal scan statistic, conditioning on the total number of cases for each diagnosis. Monte Carlo simulation was used to obtain statistical significance, and P ,"" 0.01 was the prespecified cut-off for statistical significance. Results: There were more than 4, 2.5, and 0.4 million Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen vaccinees, respectively. Outcomes with statistically significant clusters after Pfizer vaccination fell into 5 groups. For 4 of these outcome groups, the strongest clusters were mostly after Dose 2: 1) unspecified adverse effects; 2) common systemic or local reactions to vaccination; 3) myo/pericarditis; and 4) less specific cardiac or respiratory symptoms, including chest pain. The fifth group was viral pneumonia, sepsis, or respiratory failure, all in the first 3 weeks after Dose 1. Results for Moderna were similar but without a significant myo/pericarditis cluster.

From a public health perspective, it is important to gain knowledge about the real-world occurrence of side effects after COVID-19 vaccination. Objectives: We conducted a survey to identify real-world, selfreported frequency and severity of side effects during the week after vaccination. Methods: Online, cross-sectional, self-reported survey with a voluntary sample of people over 12 years old that received their first dose vaccination with any of the four EU-authorized COVID-19 vaccines as of October 2021, within the COVID-19 Vaccination Program of the region. Survey data was obtained from April 19, 2021, to October 6, 2021, at three different moments in time: day one, day three and day seven after vaccination. Answers were linked to individual-level, personal and clinical information. Respondents were stratified by the vaccine they received and reported effects were presented over time and stratified by severity. We compared our results per vaccine with the frequencies stated in each Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). We used binomial logistic models to identify associations between respondent characteristics and side effects. Results: No symptoms were reported by 1986 respondents (14.35%), 6254 informed exclusively mild symptoms (45.20%), 3444 up to moderate symptoms (24.89%), and 2153 people (15.56%) notified also severe symptoms.

6732,"Background: Healthcare claims databases used for drug or vaccine safety monitoring typically include fully adjudicated claims. The adjudication process adds to the time between the occurrence of healthcare services and their presence in the database. This lag may limit the utility of claims databases when rapid detection of adverse events is needed, as with COVID-19 vaccine monitoring. Pre-adjudicated claims may have a shorter data lag and enable more timely analyzes. Objectives: To compare the data lag in Optum's pre-adjudicated claims database with the data lag in fully adjudicated claims from the Optum Research Database (ORD). Methods: Optum compiled pre-adjudicated claims including enrollment, adjudicated prescription drug and pre-adjudicated hospital and physician health insurance claims from December 1, 2017 to October 23, 2021, in a database. Hospital and physician claims from US providers who accept patients with health insurance are incorporated, weekly, into the database following initial processing. The ORD contains adjudicated medical and pharmacy claims with linked enrollment information with data as early as 1993 available for approximately 70 million individuals with both medical and pharmacy insurance coverage. Data lag was measured as time to percent completeness and was calculated for both inpatient and outpatient claims in the preadjudicated claims and the ORD, as well as adjudicated pharmacy claims present in both databases. Results: There were 28 798 114 enrollees in the pre-adjudicated claims database during December 2017-October 2021. In the preadjudicated claims, 52% of patients were female, compared to 48% female in the ORD. The median enrollment length in the preadjudicated claims was 2.3 years, while it was 2.6 years in the ORD. The pre-adjudicated claims had an approximate two-month delay to achieve 90% completeness for inpatient claims and over 70% completeness at one-month for outpatient claims. In the fully adjudicated claims, outpatient claims had 90% completeness at three months and inpatient claims reached 90% completeness at six months. The adjudicated pharmacy claims in both databases had 90% completeness at approximately 1.5 months. Conclusions: Optum's pre-adjudicated claims database offers a fourmonth shorter lag time for inpatient claims and at least one-month shorter lag time for outpatient claims compared to the ORD.

6738,"Background: Africa identified its first COVID-19 case on 14 February 2020. Given challenges unique to Africa, Africa's capacity to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic has been a topic of much debate. Objectives: To provide an overview of the epidemiology, prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in the African region, and progress made over the first two years of the pandemic. Methods: A literature review was conducted on the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa, focusing on epidemiology, COVID-19 vaccines (access, availability, and roll-out strategies), alternative medicine, medical supplies and treatment options. The timeframe was from February 2020 to January 2022. Sources included Science Direct, EBSCO Host, PubMed, various COVID-19 global and regional websites, and WHO, African CDC and NICD reports. Results: As of February 2022 (i.e., two years into the pandemic) over 9.8 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in Africa, accounting for 3.3% of the cases reported globally. Of the total cases reported in Africa, the highest percentage was reported from South Africa (35%), followed by Morocco (10%) and Tunisia (7%). African countries face barriers in accessing COVID-19 testing, vaccines, treatments and medical supplies due to inequity, limited availability and high costs. Countries in Africa benefited through donations and support from agencies such as WHO, GAVI the vaccine alliance, the World Bank and the COVAX facility, in terms of COVID-19 vaccine roll-out. However, average vaccination rates in Africa are approximately five times lower than the rest of the world, with an important variation across African countries. Conclusions: According to the World Bank, the COVID-19 pandemic has escalated rapidly on the continent, pushing an estimated 40 million people into extreme poverty. Despite the challenges, positive developments include initiatives to manufacture vaccines on the continent and a renewed research interest into herbal and other treatment options unique to Africa. The continent's capacity to manage COVID-19 cases has gradually improved, with the increased availability of trained healthcare workers, oxygen and other medical supplies, as well as laboratory facilities. Progress has been made in Africa in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Two years into the pandemic, the WHO reported that, if current trends continue, the continent can control the pandemic in 2022. However, the WHO warned that continued monitoring is key, given potential SARSCov-2 virus mutations.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Objectives: To evaluate the clinical course, long-term sequelae, risk factors, time to resolution and impact on quality of life of myocarditis/ pericarditis associated with BNT162b2 in persons less than 21 years of age. Methods: This cohort study seeks to identify 300 cases of myocarditis/pericarditis following BNT162b2 vaccination in persons less than 21 years at approximately 30 centers of the Pediatric Heart Network (PHN), a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded consortium of research hospitals in the US and Canada. PHN investigators have already confirmed 131 cases of post-BNT162b2 myocarditis/ pericarditis at 26 PHN centers. To assist in understanding possible long-term sequelae, the PHN will conduct follow-up of these as well as new cases. Cases of post-BNT162b2 myocarditis/pericarditis will be compared to myocarditis/pericarditis associated with COVID-19 disease, including the Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). All participants will be followed in person through a 6-month visit (longer if symptoms persist) with electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, exercise stress tests, and ambulatory monitoring. Annual medical history forms and patient-reported outcome measures to assess quality of life factors will be obtained for up to 5 years after illness onset. Data from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) will be collected when ordered as part of routine clinical care. Electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and cMRI Core Labs will perform standardized evaluations of the cardiac tests. Data analyzes for this study will be descriptive, and no formal hypotheses will be tested. Results: Most of the 131 cases of myocarditis already identified in persons <21 years following vaccination with BNT162b2 have had a mild clinical course with rapid resolution of symptoms despite all having laboratory evidence of myocardial injury and the majority having abnormal cardiac MRIs.

6748,"Background: Although messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines were developed and widely utilized in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to describe the adverse events (AEs) following immunization. Objectives: This study aimed to identify the patterns associated with serious AE reports with mRNA coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines on World Health Organization (WHO)'s global scale. Methods: This study performed a latent class analysis from VigiBase between December 2020 and August 2021. The 10 most frequently system organ class (SOC) terms of medical dictionary for regulatory activities as parameters to estimate were used in the latent class analysis (LCA). The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were defined as either tozinamernan or elasomeran as the suspected drug of individual case safety reports in J07BX (other viral vaccines) on the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code. A serious AE is defined as a report that is associated with death, life-threatening, hospitalization or prolongation, and results of chronic damage/disability. We considered death, life-threatening, and hospitalization to be high-seriousness. The reporting characteristics in accordance with classes were described. Results: A total of 145 038 spontaneous reports on mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were identified between December 2020 and August 2021 in VigiBase. The most common SOC terms were general disorders and administration site conditions, nervous system disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. Three classes of AE reports were distinguished on LCA. Class 1 accounted for 24% (34 972 reports) of the reports and was distinguished from other classes by being composed AEs of reported time to onset shorter than 1 day (60.2%, 21 042 reports), and reported by consumers (44.8%, 15 679 reports). Class 2 represented about 62% (90 209 reports) of the reports, predominantly with the death (12.9%, 11 620 reports). The reports by physician (23.0%, 4570 reports), and hospitalization (36.6%, 7264 reports) were more likely to be in class 3. In addition, an increased high-seriousness risk was observed in class 2 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.551.66), and class 3 (aOR 1.90, 95% CI 1.82-2.00) compared with class 1. Conclusions: Using LCA, we found distinct 3 classes based on the most frequent AEs after COVID-19 vaccines administration.

6751,"Background: A broad vaccination coverage is crucial for preventing the spread of COVID-19 and reduce serious illness or death. Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine social inequalities in COVID-19 vaccination uptake as of 17 May 2021 among Swedish adults aged  60 years. Methods: The study population comprised a general population cohort aged 60 years or older (n ,"" 350 805), representative of the Swedish population. Data were collected through the nationwide linked multi-register observational study SCIFI-PEARL, and associations between sociodemographic determinants and COVID-19 vaccination uptake were analyzed using logistic regression. Intersectional analyzes of sociodemographic heterogeneity were performed by taking several overlapping social dimensions into account. Data availability extended to 17 May 2021. Results: The overall vaccination coverage in the Swedish population aged 60 years or older was 87.2% by 17 May 2021. Individuals in the non-vaccinated group were significantly (p < 0.05) more often younger (78.5% vs. 57.8%), males (49.6% vs. 47.2%), had a lower income (47.5% vs. 30.1%), were born outside Sweden (34.9% vs. 12.2%), lived alone (58.4% vs. 43.1%), lived in a region with a major city (60.9% vs. 46.7%), and/or had a history of COVID-19 (11.3% vs. 5.1%), compared to the vaccinated group. The lowest COVID-19 vaccination uptake was seen in individuals born in low-or middle-income countries, of whom only 60% had received vaccination, with an odds ratio (OR) of not being vaccinated of 6.05 (95% CI: 5.856.26) compared to individuals born in Sweden. These associations persisted after adjustments for possible confounding factors. The intersectional analyzes showed even larger variations in vaccination in cross-classified sociodemographic subgroups (ranging from 44% to 97%), with marked differences in uptake of vaccination within sociodemographic groups. Conclusions: The uptake of COVID-19 vaccine during the spring of 2021 in Sweden varied substantially both between and within sociodemographic groups. The use of an intersectional approach, taking several overlapping social dimensions into account at the same time rather than only using unidimensional measures, contributes to a better understanding of the complexity in the uptake of vaccination.""",1.0,spread,True

Objectives: The objective of this rapid cycle analysis (RCA) of COVID19 was to track vaccine administrations and monitor pre-specified AESIs following COVID-19 vaccines in a near-real time setting for all three COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: Individuals who received COVID-19 vaccines were identified in Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) which includes vaccines given in the VA and outside of VA using the CPT codes and CVX codes from December 14, 2020 to February 6, 2022. Pre-specified AESIs include anaphylaxis, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), myocarditis/pericarditis, and others and were identified using ICD-10 codes. Patients who received any vaccines from October 2015 to February 2020 were identified and used to estimate background rates for AESIs. The Poisson-based maximized sequential probability ratio test (MaxSPRT) was applied. RCA was conducted weekly for dose 1, dose 2, and booster dose separately. Results: Approximately, 4.07 million Moderna (2.10M dose 1 and 1.97M dose 2) and 3.69 million Pfizer (1.90M dose 1 and 1.79M dose 2), and 322 thousand Janssen vaccines were administered. In addition, about 1.62 million mRNA booster doses were administered. Among individuals who received doses 1 or 2 of mRNA vaccines, about 60% were aged 65 years or older and 88% were male. Sixty-five percent were White and 18% were Black. Individuals receiving Janssen were younger with more females. Individuals receiving booster doses were older compared to doses 1 and 2. The RCA revealed a signal for anaphylaxis but no signals for other AESIs. The observed to expected risk ratio for myocarditis/pericarditis following booster dose was larger compared with those following doses 1 and 2. Conclusions: VA used weekly data to rapidly detect a potential signal for pre-specified AESIs following administration of COVID-19 vaccines.

Objectives: To estimate the risk of myo/peri after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in a large US commercial claims dataset. Methods: We conducted a self-controlled case series study of those 18-64 years old (yo) with record of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in IQVIA LRxDx OpenClaims data from 12/202012/2021 to estimate the risk of incident myo/peri diagnosis in the 28-day risk window following vaccination, both overall and stratified by age and sex. We examined each vaccine (Moderna and Pfizer) and dose (first and second) separately and included a wash-out period (15-day) prior to first dose. For sensitivity analyzes, we varied risk windows, and we used only post-exposure risk intervals. For context, we assessed risk of myo/peri after COVID-19 diagnosis using a similar design. Results: We observed 12 714 and 17 568 myo/peri events among those administered Moderna (N , 49 518 140) or Pfizer (N ,"" 75 115 773) vaccines at least once, respectively.

In the age and sex stratified analyzes risk was highest among males and younger patients (<25 and 26-35 year-old) for both Moderna and Pfizer, particularly after their second dose; results were robust to sensitivity analyzes. COVID-19 diagnosis was also associated with increased risk after adjusting for age.
