5,"Abstract There is a male sex disadvantage in morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. Proposed explanations to this disparity include gender-related health behaviors, differential distribution of comorbidities and biological sex differences. In this study, we investigated the association between sex and risk of severe COVID-19 while adjusting for comorbidities, socioeconomic factors, as well as unmeasured factors shared by cohabitants which are often left unadjusted. We conducted a total-population-based cohort study (n,""1,854,661) based on individual-level register data. Cox models was used to estimate the associations between sex and risk for severe COVID-19. We additionally used a within-household design and conditional Cox models aiming to account for unmeasured factors shared by cohabitants. A secondary aim was to compare the risk of COVID-19 related secondary outcomes between men and women hospitalized due to COVID-19 using logistic regression. Men were at higher risk for hospitalization (HR"",1.63;95%CI,""1.57-1.68), ICU admission (HR"",2.63;95%CI,2.38-2.91) and death (HR,1.81;95%CI,""1.68-1.95) due to COVID-19, based on fully adjusted models. However, the effect of sex varied significantly across age groups: Among people in their 50s, men had>four times higher risk of COVID-19 death. The within-household design did not provide any further explanation to the sex disparity. Among patients hospitalized due to COVID-19, men had an increased risk for viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory insufficiency, acute kidney injury, and sepsis which persisted in fully adjusted models. Recognition of the combined effect of sex and age on COVID-19 outcomes has implications for policy strategies to reduce the adverse effects of the disease.""",1.0,COVID-19,True

14,"Apart from old age and male sex, comorbidities, including widespread cardiovascular and endocrine diseases, are known risk factors for severe COVID-19.[5] As the prevalence of many of these diseases differ between sexes, underlying comorbidities and related life-style factors have been suggested as a plausible explanation for the excess risk among men. Gender-based differences in attitudes and behaviors, such as COVID-19 risk perception, healthcare seeking behavior, and compliance to behaviors to avoid infection and spread of the disease,[6, 7] have also been suggested to contribute to the sex disparity.

17,"COVID-19.[8, 9] Women generally elicit stronger innate and adaptive immune responses towards antigens,[8, 10-12] resulting in differences in prevalence and outcomes between men and women for several infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases; Generally, men are more vulnerable to infectious diseases, whereas women are more likely to develop autoimmune diseases. Studies from previous coronavirus outbreaks revealed that men are at higher risk for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)[13] and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).[14] There is also evidence that women in general develop a more robust humoral and cell-mediated immune response and report more adverse effects towards vaccination than men.[15-18] Similarly, differences between sexes in measured immune responses among COVID-19 patients have also been identified. Male sex has been associated with higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-18 and CCL5, higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios, lower absolute lymphocyte counts and a more robust induction of non-classical monocytes, whereas female sex has been associated with a more robust T-cell activation.[9, 19, 20] Thus, differences in immune responses have been suggested to explain the excess risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes among men, although the cause and effect between immune response and disease severity is not fully clear.",1.0,COVID-19,True
18,"Numerous studies have indicated that male sex is a significant risk factor for severe COVID-19. Many studies are based on large, aggregated data with limited ability to adjust for important confounders, whereas other studies are smaller, hospital-based, and often suffer from selection bias and limited generalizability. Therefore, the main aim of this large population-based cohort study was to examine the sex disparity in the risk of hospitalization, ICU admission and death due to COVID-19 by utilizing the ability to link several health and administrative registers containing individual-level data on COVID-19 outcomes, as well as important comorbidities and socioeconomic factors. To analyze the sex disparity in severe COVID-19 outcomes further, we additionally used a within-household design in a subpopulation of the cohort aiming to adjust for unobserved factors shared by individuals living in the same household. This includes housing-related living conditions such as many social, economic and lifestyle related factors which are often shared by cohabitants to a large extent but are often left unadjusted despite being a potential source of omitted variable bias. The within-household design also partly accounts for SARS-CoV-2 exposure since much of the virus transmission occurs within households. A secondary aim of this study was to compare the risk of severe secondary outcomes related to COVID-19 between men and women hospitalized due to COVID-19.",1.0,COVID-19,True

Individuals living together evidently share the same housing-related living conditions, as well as many other social, economic and lifestyle related factors to a large extent. Further, since much of the transmission of SARSCoV-2 occur within households, individuals living together have a similar risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

Male sex was associated with higher rates of hospitalization due to COVID-19, with HRs that remained stable around 1.6 in both partially and fully adjusted models (fully adjusted HR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.57-1.68). However, there was a statistically significant (p<0.05) interaction with age; men's increased risk was most pronounced among middle aged people. Men aged 40-49 experienced a twice as large risk for hospitalization due to COVID-19 compared to women of the same age, while young adult men (18-39 years) only experienced 25% larger risk and men of old age (>80 years) only experienced a 40% larger risk.

Overall, men experienced approximately 2.6 times higher risk of ICU admission due to COVID-19, and the point estimate remained stable and statistically significant in all models (fully adjusted HR: 2.63; 95% CI: 2.38-2.91). There was again a statistically significant (p<0.05) interaction with age. Young adult men (18-39 years) did not experience a statistically significant increased risk compared to women of the same age, whereas for all ages above 40, men experienced a three times larger risk for ICU admission. Finally, the pattern was also similar for death due to COVID-19. Overall, men experienced approximately 80% greater risk of death due to COVID-19 (fully adjusted HR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.68-1.95). Again, this effect varied significantly (p<0.05) across age groups with the most pronounced difference observed among men and women aged 50-59 years, where men experienced a~4.6 times higher risk of death. The stark difference in risk of death then decreased with increasing age, settling at ~1.6 larger risk for men older than 80 years compared to women of the same age. We did not find any increased risk of death due to COVID-19 among men younger than 50 years of age, however, there were very few deaths in these age groups.

Further, adjusting for unobserved factors shared by individuals in the same household in a conditional Cox analysis did not provide any further explanation to the sex disparity in severe COVID-19 outcomes.

512,"Our finding that men are at higher risk of severe COVID19 infection and death compared to women, and that the increased relative risk varies across age-groups is consistent with previous studies.[1, 3, 19] The age-sex pattern of a pronounced higher relative risk for men around middle age has been hypothesized to be (at least partially) caused by the differential distribution of comorbidities across sexes and age strata. Women are generally reported to have a higher comorbidity burden, especially at older ages. However, women tend to suffer from more non-fatal chronic conditions such as migraine, depression, autoimmune and musculoskeletal diseases, whereas men have more life-threatening conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, chronic lung diseases and type-2 diabetes,[28, 29] which are associated with a worse progression of COVID-19.[5] Thus, a higher burden of specific comorbidities in men may explain the markedly increased risk for severe COVID19 outcomes around middle age, whereas a reduction of the increased relative risk for men at older ages may be explained by a survival effect leaving only the healthiest men to survive to old age. However, adjustments for comorbidities and socioeconomic factors did not attenuate the association between sex and severe COVID-19 outcomes in any age group. This finding is in line with previous studies on case fatality among patients with a confirmed infection reporting an increased risk among men independent of comorbidities, demographics, and health behaviors.[19, 30].",1.0,disease,True

617,"COVID-19 as a serious health problem and to agree and comply with restraining public policies.[6] However, such behaviors are primarily associated with risk for infection, whereas results from large meta-analyses and epidemiological surveillance demonstrate that COVID-19 infection rates are similar between sexes.[2, 4] Further, the test positivity rate among asymptomatic individuals has also been shown to be similar between sexes,[19] or even higher in women. [31] Therefore, the increased risk for morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 among men does not seem to be explained by higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure or susceptibility. Our finding that among hospitalized patients with COVID19, men had an increased risk for COVID-19 related complications (i.e., viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory insufficiency, acute kidney injury, and sepsis) independent of previous comorbidities and socioeconomic factors, also suggests that men have a higher risk of severe disease progression, rather than just increased virus exposure or susceptibility. It has also been suggested that gender-related social norms may cause men to postpone seeking out medical treatment, thereby experiencing more severe COVID-19 due to this delay. However, previous studies have found indications both for and against this tendency.[19, 32] Since we have not been able to adjust for these types of behaviors, we cannot rule out that delayed treatment among men partially explains our results. However, data from countries worldwide show that the sex disparity in COVID-19 case fatality and intensive therapy unit admissions is a global phenomenon with relatively homogenous relative risk estimates,[1, 4, 10] whereas gender differences in social behavior, life-style factors and comorbidities vary across countries. In addition, results from the withinhousehold design provided no further explanation to the",1.0,COVID-19,True
618,"sex disparity, despite accounting for housing-related living conditions, including many social and lifestyle related factors to a large extent, as well as exposure to SARS-CoV-2, given that much of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occur within households.[33] Thus, the within-household design presumably partly accounts for gender-related differences, especially those who are related to risk of infection, even though gender-related differences in attitudes and behavior exist within households. Thus, we find it unlikely that gender differences in social behaviors is a driver of men's increased risk in severe COVID-19 outcomes.",1.0,social,True
619,"The observed sex disparity in COVID-19 outcomes could be a consequence of several biological sex differences, such as sex steroid hormone levels, sex chromosomes, differential genetic expression, and differences in the immune function, whereof some may interact with age.[10] Sex steroid hormones have known immunomodulatory functions; whereas estrogens may have both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects, androgens mainly act immunosuppressive.[34-36] Experimental animal studies support a beneficial immunomodulatory effect of estrogens towards coronaviruses,[37, 38] and epidemiological evidence indicates that hormone replacement treatment with estradiol may reduce COVID19 mortality in post-menopausal women.[39] Although less studied, there are also some epidemiological indications of a potential negative effect of androgens on risk of COVID19 infection, as a positive effect of anti-androgen treatment among male prostate cancer patients was observed.[40].",1.0,COVID-19,True

623,"X-inactivation in females, there is usually no difference in dosage of X-linked gene products between sexes. However, incomplete inactivation of X-linked genes may occur at varying degree between genes and individuals,[43] and have been associated with higher prevalence of autoimmune diseases in women. For example, enhanced Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene expression has been associated with increased risk for SLE and other autoimmune disorders in women.[44] TLR7 is a pattern recognition receptor used to detect single stranded RNA, including coronaviruses. Ligand binding to TLR7 results in an increased production of type I interferons, which is an important mechanism of the innate immune system towards virus infections found to be stronger in women.[45, 46] In case studies, supposed loss-of-function mutations in TLR7 have been identified in young men with severe or fatal outcomes in COVID19, without any known predisposing risk factors.[47, 48] A subsequent study screening for X-linked mutations in men, identified deleterious TLR7 variants in men with unexplained severe COVID-19, whereas none were identified among the mildly or asymptomatically infected men. [49] Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 gene is also coded on the X-chromosome and has been found to be regulated by estrogens.[50]ACE2 has a crucial role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) which regulate blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis. Thus, it has also been speculated that sex-derived differences in ACE2 expression and regulation may in part explain differences in COVID-19 outcomes.[51, 52].",1.0,disease,True
624,"Severe COVID-19 is associated with a state of dysregulated immune responses associated with excessive production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs, a so-called cytokine storm, causing lung injury and respiratory distress, together with lymphopenia. Deaths due to COVID-19 usually result from acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory failure, coagulopathy, organ failure and septic shock.[53] We found that men hospitalized due to COVID19 were at higher risk of acute cardiac injury and cerebral infarcts compared to women, but this effect seemed to be confounded by underlying comorbidities. In contrast, we also found that male COVID-19 patients had a higher risk of developing pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory insufficiency, acute kidney injury, and sepsis compared to female patients, which seemed to be independent of underlying comorbidities and socioeconomic factors.",1.0,COVID-19,True
625,"A major strength of this study is the total populationbased setting with complete coverage of COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths, why this study is not subjected to selection bias. Another important strength is the use of",1.0,COVID-19,True
626,"administrative register data on socioeconomic factors. For example, these included information on housing arrangements that enabled the novel use of within-household comparisons to address unknown and unmeasured confounders shared by cohabitants in the study of sex disparities in severe COVID-19 outcomes. Further, the unique Stockholm Regional Healthcare Data Warehouse, which contains information on hospitalizations as well as data from primary and secondary care, improved our capability to identify individuals with important comorbidities, compared to using only hospital-based data.",1.0,COVID-19,True
627,"There are also limitations to consider. This is an observational study, and as such we cannot determine the causal relationships that underlies the male sex disadvantage in morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. This study could have been subjected to surveillance bias as men generally receive more specialist inpatient care, which could increase the chance of being detected with COVID-19 in health registers. To minimize this issue, we defined COVID-19 hospitalizations based on main diagnosis only. The accuracy of COVID-19 diagnoses in Swedish health and cause of death registers is presumably high but have not been formally validated. Sensitivity of hospital diagnoses as a measure of severe COVID-19 morbidity among older patients may be an issue since age discrimination in access to care has occurred.[54] Although it has not been shown that this age discrimination differs by sex, results of hospitalizations and ICU admissions among elderly should be interpreted more carefully. Some cases of comorbidity may have been misclassified. However, this is likely nondifferential with regard to sex. On the other hand, under-diagnosis, especially of less severe comorbidities, may differ between sexes and introduce bias. Residual confounding by life-style factors and comorbidities, especially mild cases not identified by registers, may be a limitation. However, these factors are likely captured by adjustments for socioeconomic factors and factors shared within households to some extent, though adjustments for these factors did not notably change the observed estimates. Emerging evidence seems to support an association between smoking and more severe COVID-19 outcomes.[55, 56] However, more women than men smoke daily in Sweden, although the difference is marginal.[57] Therefore, it is not likely that smoking status is a major driver of the observed sex disparity. Another consideration is that the follow-up period for hospitalizations and ICU admissions (ending on May 16, 2021) overlaps with the introduction of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, which started in week 52, 2020. The vaccination coverage increased slowly during the first quarter of 2021 and thereafter started to increase more steeply. At the end of our study period, almost 10% had received two doses and about 30% had received at least one dose. Thus, vaccination status could potentially",1.0,COVID-19,True

However, results from our sensitivity analysis showed that HRs were the same during the first (before vaccination was initiated) and second wave (when the vaccination started) of the pandemic. Thus, it is unlikely that vaccination status interferes with our results. It is also unlikely that other factors that vary over time or between pandemic waves, such as stochastic transmission of the virus to different groups of people and new mutations and strain variants emerging, affect the sex ratio observed in our results.",1.0,pandemic,True
630,"Our results confirm that men have an excess risk of hospitalization, ICU admission and death due to COVID-19. This sex disparity varies across age groups and is most pronounced among middle aged men compared to women of the same age. Further, among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, men are more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 related complications. Different explanations have been suggested to explain men's vulnerability to COVID-19, including gender related health behaviors, differential distribution of comorbidities and biological sex differences such as sex steroid hormones, genetic constitution, or differential gene expression. The reason for men's excessive risk is likely multifactorial with a complex interplay between several factors. In this study we adjusted for multiple confounders, including important comorbidities, socioeconomic factors as well as unmeasured household-related factors. These adjustments had no substantial impact on men's excess risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Thus, our results motivate a focus in future studies on biological mechanisms that influence the immune response towards SARS-CoV-2 to help explain women's advantage in COVID-19. This study also highlights the importance to consider the combined effect of age and sex when defining those at highest risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes.",1.0,COVID-19,True
