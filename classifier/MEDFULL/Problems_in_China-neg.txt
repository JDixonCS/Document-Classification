Objectives: The management of grade III acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries remains controversial. Good to excellent results have been reported with nonsurgical management; however, some patients report persistent pain related to the AC joint following non-operative treatment and may eventually seek surgical management. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes in patients who completed non-operative (non-op) therapy to those who failed non-operative therapy and proceeded to AC reconstruction. Methods: This is a level 3 study. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained prior to initiation of this study. 38 patients were initially treated non-op for acute grade III AC joint injuries with physical therapy. Demographic and surgical data along with pre- and post-treatment clinical outcomes scores including ASES, SF-12 PCS, QuickDASH, and SANE scores were collected a minimum of two years after initial presentation. Non-op failure occurred when a patient underwent AC reconstruction before final follow-up. Results: 38 patients with a mean age of 38 years (range, 22-79 years) were included. 28/38 (74%) successfully completed non-op treatment whereas 10/38 (26%) failed after a median of 44 days (range, 6 days-17 months) from the initiation of physical therapy. Of the 10 patients who failed, 9 (90%) sought treatment >30 days after the injury. Two of these patients had a subsequent surgery before final follow-up and were therefore not included in outcomes analysis. Follow-up was available for the remaining 7/8 patients (87.5%) who failed non-op treatment and for 22/28 patients (78%) who were successfully treated non-op. Mean follow up was 3.3 years (range, 2.0-5.9). There were no significant differences in all outcomes scores between groups (p>0.05): Mean SF-12 PCS was 56.1 (range, 52.4-61.4) in those who successfully completed non-op treatment compared to 56.2 points (range, 53.1-58.0) in those who finally underwent surgery (p=0.680). Mean SANE score was 96 points (range, 65-100) in those who successfully completed non-op treatment compared to 95 points (range, 24-98) in those who finally underwent surgery (p=0.175). Mean ASES score was 95.5 points (range, 51-100) in patients with successful non-op treatment and 97.1 points (range, 91.6-100) in patients with eventual surgery (p=0.348). The mean QuickDASH score was 2.2 points in both groups with a range of 0-41 for those with successful non-op treatment and a range of 0-14 for those with eventual surgery (p=0.756). Patients who sought treatment >30 days after injury demonstrated decreased postoperative SANE scores (p = 0.002) and had 13.8 fold greater relative risk for failure of non-op treatment. Conclusion: Surgical decision making for patients with acute grade III AC joint injuries is evolving. According to our results, (1) a trial of non-op treatment is warranted as successful outcomes can be expected even in those that eventually opt for surgery, and (2) patients who present >30 days after their injury are much less likely to complete nonoperative treatment successfully.

Abstract Objective: This study was performed to evaluate the effect of two different methods of controlling glycemic variability (GV) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (STBI) undergoing surgery. Methods: Patients with STBI were randomly grouped into a conventional adjustment process (CAP) group and modified Leuven's adjustment process (mLAP) group. Each group included 50 patients. Blood glucose levels were continuously monitored and data were recorded and analyzed. Results: The mean blood glucose level was stable in both groups for 5 days postoperatively with no significant difference. The standard deviation of the blood glucose level, mean amplitude of glycemic excursions, and glycemic lability index were significantly higher in the CAP than mLAP group for the first 2 days. In the final 3 days, no significant differences were observed between the two groups. The incidence of hypoglycemia was significantly higher in the CAP than mLAP group

Introduction
Severe traumatic brain injury (STBI) is a common condition seen in clinical neurosurgery, and it results in a heavy burden on society and the patient's family because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. Approximately 14% of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) present with a high blood glucose concentration.1 This rate is increased to 55.76% to 76.49% of patients with STBI.1 Stress hyperglycemia is an important complication of STBI.
Glycemic variability (GV) is an important factor that reflects the efficiency of blood glucose control. It is not only a predictive factor of the patient's prognosis, but it also influences the outcome of patients with STBI.2 In most Chinese health centers, practitioners in the intensive care unit (ICU) apply a conventional adjustment

process (CAP) to control the blood glucose level.3 The modified Leuven's adjustment process (mLAP) was recently recommended for glycemic control,4 and we have found no previous studies that compared these two types of adjustment processes. Therefore, we performed a prospective study to evaluate the efficiency of the mLAP and CAP in controlling GV. In addition, we adopted partial strategies of the two adjustment processes based on the particular characteristics of STBI. Control processes for patients with blood glucose levels below the range of 7.8 to 10.0 mmol/L were not performed.
Patients and methods
Patients
This was a prospective observational study approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Affiliated Su Bei People's Hospital of Jiangsu Province with a signed waiver of informed consent. No medical decisions were based on the results. Informed consent for the blood glucose adjustment process was obtained from each patient's parent or legal guardian.
We included consecutive patients who were treated in the ICU at our institution and diagnosed with STBI by a head computed tomography scan from April 2013 to

Xue et al.

1507

July 2014. All selected cases conformed to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) the patient met the criteria for STBI,5 (2) the first Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score ranged from 3 to 8 upon admission to the hospital, (3) the patient was 18 to 60 years of age, (4) the random blood glucose level was !11.1 mmol/L, (5) the patient had no medical history that would induce hyperglycemia, and (6) the patient's family members consented to the study.
The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) the patient had a medical history of diabetes or a long course of treatment with steroids, immunosuppressants, or thyroid hormones; (2) the patient still had a serious midline shift or needed a secondary operation after the first operation; (3) the inpatient stay was shorter than 24 h; (4) the patient had a history of mental illness; (5) the patient was pregnant or breastfeeding; and (6) the patient was in a terminal stage of STBI or the family members did not consent to the study.
Finally, the rejection criteria for the study were as follows: (1) interventions that caused the patients to discontinue the study and (2) adverse events, complications, or physiological changes that caused the patients to be ineligible for the study.
Grouping method
The random envelope method was applied for grouping. The different intervention strategies were placed into the envelopes. The researchers successively opened the envelopes according to the patients' order of hospital admission, and the patients were thus assigned to either the mLAP group or CAP group.
Monitoring indices and evaluation of content
All patients underwent peripheral blood glucose testing when they returned to the

ICU after surgery. In the CAP group, the frequency of blood glucose monitoring was adjusted according to the scope of the blood glucose level (Table 1). The frequency of monitoring in the mLAP group was every 2 hours (Table 2). All patients in the study underwent constant monitoring, and blood glucose levels were recorded for 5 days. These values were used to calculate the mean blood glucose (MBG), incidence of hypoglycemia ( 3.2 mmol/L), standard deviation of blood glucose (SDBG), mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), and glycemic lability index (GLI). Among these data, the MBG, MAGE, and GLI were used to estimate the GV.
Conventional treatment
The blood glucose levels of all patients were strictly controlled during the first 5 days of therapy, which was the length of our study. The patients' vital signs and pupil sizes, especially when the patients were unconscious, were closely observed. In patients with STBI, the administration of 20% mannitol, furosemide, glucocorticoids, Intralipid (20% intravenous fat emulsion; Baxter, Deerfield, IL, USA), and low-molecular-weight dextran might have an effect on hyperglycemia. Therefore, in such patients, the changes in blood glucose levels should be observed and the frequency of monitoring must be reasonably adjusted when these medications are used so that the rate of abnormal hyperglycemia can be reduced. Peptison (Nutricia Pharmaceutical, Schiphol, The Netherlands), which is a type of low-sugar enteral nutritional product, was used to provide nutrition. It was continually infused to enable even absorption of the nutrition.
Insulin therapy for GV
The blood glucose levels were maintained within the range of 7.8 to 10.0 mmol/L through the use of a subcutaneous pump

that provided continuous insulin. During therapy, our researchers monitored the dose of insulin and its effect on blood glucose control. Each group of patients underwent a different blood glucose control protocol. In the CAP group, we applied the guidelines of glucose detective and work standards from the book entitled ICU: Standard; Process; Practice3 (Table 1); in the mLAP group, the mLAP protocol was performed (Table 2). These methods were not suitable for patients with STBI who had blood glucose levels lower than 7.8 to 10.0 mmol/L. For these patients, we only applied partial methods to avoid hypoglycemia. During the control of blood glucose, electrolyte disturbances and other adverse reactions were observed and resolved in a timely manner.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To assess the differences in patient characteristics between the two groups, t-tests (for comparisons of the MBG, SDBG, MAGE,

and GLI) and chi-square tests were used with a level of significance of p < 0.05.
Results
Clinical characteristics
Our prospective investigation included 100 patients with STBI (50 patients in each group) according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patient population consisted of 63 males and 37 females, with ages ranging from to 27 to 61 years (mean age, 46.22  3.59 years). No significant differences in age or sex were found between the two groups. The differences in the interval from trauma to admission between the CAP group (3.29  1.39 h) and the mLAP group (3.06  1.60 h) and the first GCS score at admission were not significant. Multiple complex cerebral trauma (more than 2 types of TBI) was the most common type of TBI in both the CAP group (24 patients, 48.0%) and mLAP group (27 patients, 54.0%). The difference between the groups was not significant. The different types of operations that were

Comparison of monitoring indices
During the first 5 days postoperatively, the MBG level was controlled within a limited scope ranging from approximately 7.8 to 10.0 mmol/L, and the MBG values between the two groups were not significantly different on any of the days.
During the first 2 days, the SDBG, MAGE (Figure 1), and GLI in the CAP group (day 1: 4.7  1.2 mmol/L, 0.86  0.41 mmol/L, and 255.9  213.7; day 2: 4.0  1.7 mmol/L, 0.63  0.38 mmol/L,

and 112.7  92.8) were significantly higher than those in the mLAP group (day 1: 1.1  0.68 mmol/L, 0.51  0.25 mmol/L, and 255.9  213.7; day 2: 1.2  0.44 mmol/L, 0.41  0.17 mmol/L, and 93.1  72.7, p < 0.05). These values showed a decreasing trend over the next 3 days in both groups with no significant differences between the groups.
The incidence of hypoglycemia in the CAP group (15.2%  3.7%) was significantly higher than that in the mLAP group (10.4%  1.8%) on the first day postoperatively (p < 0.05). During the next 4 days, this rate began to decrease in both groups, but the downward trend was not significantly different between the two groups (Table 4).

Discussion Stress hyperglycemia in patients with STBI
Stress hyperglycemia is a physiological phenomenon involving an increase the in blood

glucose level due to infection, trauma, or hemorrhage and can lead to the development of a neuroendocrine disorder. This type of hyperglycemia only occurs in patients without diabetes. STBI includes intracerebral hemorrhage, brain stem

injury, and a midline shift induced by diffuse brain white matter injury, which results in damage to the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis. Damage to the structure and function of the brain can also overstimulate the sympathoadrenomedullary system, which induces an imbalance of insulin, catecholamines, and glucagon, leading to hyperglycemia. Meanwhile, the abnormal release of cytokines and the occurrence of insulin resistance induce hyperglycemia.6 Nutritional support also influences hyperglycemia.
The mechanism of hyperglycemia after STBI, its negative effects, and its control programs have recently received increasing attention.7 Hyperglycemia is regarded as a factor that can influence the prognosis7-10 as well as the development of hypoxia and hypotension.11 One observational study showed that STBI was associated with an increase in the blood glucose level during admission; the mean increase in the glucose level was based on the presence of isolated STBI, and the study showed that further surgical intervention may not change the blood glucose level.7 Hyperglycemia can change the plasma osmotic pressure

(which can impact cell shape and function), retrain immune cell function, induce the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, induce mitochondrial dysfunction, and increase oxygen free radicals, thus negatively impacting the entire organism.12 Appropriate management of stress hyperglycemia is therefore closely related to the outcome of STBI.
Damage induced by GV
GV is a wide fluctuation of the blood glucose level,12-14 but the fluctuation range and frequency have not yet been defined. Egi et al.,15 who performed a case-control study involving 7,034 patients with STBI in 4 institutions in 2006, concluded that GV was the main target in blood glucose control. Larger GV is an important risk factor for increased mortality.14-16 Another study conducted in China showed that GV in the early stage is an independent factor that could influence the prognosis of patients with STBI.17 Bagshaw et al.18 retrospectively analyzed 66,184 patients with STBI and concluded that GV and hypoglycemia in the early stage can predict the mortality rate. Yoder19 reported that hypoglycemia could induce a metabolic energy disorder and lead to an increase in lactate, which would increase hypoxic/ischemic brain damage. However, hyperglycemia associated with TBI could increase the lactate/ pyruvate ratio, which would result in dramatic alkalization. These processes will result in nerve cell death.20 From our viewpoint, strict glycemic control includes two aspects: decreasing the MBG and decreasing the GV. The SDBG, MAGE, and GLI may reflect the GV, which is a significant factor that influences the prognosis of the patient.
Advantages of the mLAP
Strict glycemic control is not an easy task; it requires high-frequency glycemic monitoring

and management of complicated insulin injections. Previous studies have shown that these two procedures highly influence glycemic fluctuation.20 Studies have shown that the time spent by doctors to maintain blood glucose levels within a normal level, according to their own experience, is 27.4% of a day.21 Doctors and nurses should cooperate to better control blood glucose levels.22
In this prospective study, comparison of the mLAP with the CAP showed that the latter protocol required more complicated procedures than the former protocol. Using the CAP, investigators found several problems such as delayed monitoring and mismatch between the application of insulin and the change in blood glucose. These problems occurred because the process required a higher number of professional medical workers. In contrast, the mLAP protocol has the advantages of early adjustment, relatively simple procedures, and a simple operation. In addition, the complication rate associated with the mLAP was high for the different investigators. Finally, our series showed that GV under the CAP was higher than under the mLAP during the first 3 days postoperatively. The differences in GV between the two groups were not significant from days 3 to 5 postoperatively because of the gradual improvement of patients who were managed by the CAP. TBI and craniotomy can damage the glycemic self-adjustment process, which would make glycemic control difficult. In contrast, the mLAP was more beneficial for patients with TBI because of the well-controlled glucose level. These factors would be beneficial for improvement of the prognosis of patients with STBI.
Limitations
This study was performed to estimate the effect of the CAP and mLAP on GV of patients undergoing surgery for STBI.

However, several limitations should be mentioned. First, it was necessary to strictly obey the inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure safety and effectiveness in this study. As a result, the number of patients in the two groups was small and the patients' characteristics differed, restricting the application of multiple statistical analyses. Thus, bias could not be avoided. Second, the study was performed during a 5-day period, which may have been too short. A longer study duration could provide more useful information about the advantages and disadvantages of the two blood glucose adjustment processes (however, ensuring patient safety is still the most important factor in such studies). In addition, because of the short observation time, the relationship between the two blood glucose adjustment processes and complications such as deep vein thrombosis, intracranial infection, and pressure sore development could not be evaluated. Third, the study only included two types of blood glucose adjustment processes. This may have reduced the strength of our study conclusion to some degree. Finally, STBI is a complex disease involving different types of cerebral hematomas and contusions, which may have different effects on the blood glucose level and GV. This may also lead to biased results. Therefore, we are planning to perform a multicenter prospective randomized study involving a larger sample and longer observation time, more types of blood glucose adjustment processes, and stricter inclusion and exclusion criteria to verify the therapeutic effects of these processes in patients with STBI.

Autologous Hamstring Anterior Cruciate Ligament Graft Failure Using the Anteromedial Portal Technique With Suspensory Femoral Fixation
A Case Series of 7 Patients
Balazs Galdi,* MD, Allan Reyes, BS, Eugene W. Brabston, MD, and William N. Levine,|| MD Investigation performed at the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA
Background: The anteromedial portal technique for drilling of the femoral tunnel during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has been advocated by many surgeons as allowing improved access to the anatomical footprint. Furthermore, suspensory fixation of soft tissue grafts has become popularized because of complications associated with cross-pin fixation. Concerns regarding the use of both have recently arisen. Purpose: To raise awareness of the increased risk of graft failure when using the anteromedial portal technique with suspensory femoral fixation during ACL reconstruction. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: From November 1998 to August 2012, a total of 465 primary ACL reconstructions were performed using quadrupled hamstring autograft tendons, with drilling of the femoral tunnel performed via the transtibial portal. Graft fixation on the femur was achieved with cross-pin fixation, while interference screw fixation was used on the tibia. From September 2012 to October 2013, there were 69 reconstructions performed through an anteromedial portal. While there was no change in graft choice, a change was made to using suspensory femoral fixation. No other surgical or postoperative rehabilitation changes were made. Results: During the 14-year period in which ACL reconstructions were performed via the transtibial portal and with cross-pin fixation, 2 graft failures (0.4% failure rate) were reported. After switching to the anteromedial portal with suspensory fixation, 7 graft failures (10.1% failure rate) were reported over a 13-month period. These were 5 male and 2 female patients, with a mean age of 18.8 years--all elite athletes. The same surgical technique was used in all patients, and all patients had at least an 8 mm-diameter graft. Patients were cleared to return to sport at an average of 8.4 months postoperatively, after completing functional performance tests. Of the 7 patients, 6 sustained a rerupture of the graft within 2 weeks of returning to full competition. The final patient sustained a rerupture 10 months after being cleared to play. Conclusion: Compared with the transtibial technique with cross-pin graft fixation, there is an increased risk of graft failure when performing autologous hamstring ACL reconstructions using the anteromedial portal technique with cortical suspensory fixation.

The less invasive arthroscopic transtibial technique for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction was popularized in the early 1990s after comparable results to the open 2-incision technique were obtained.17 However, with increased use, concerns arose regarding the ability of this

technique to restore the native anatomy and function of the ACL. Although the procedure was highly effective in limiting anterior tibial translation as a result of re-establishing the anteromedial bundle, it often failed to restore the posterolateral bundle, resulting in residual rotatory instability.4,8,15,27 As a result of these concerns, the anteromedial portal technique for preparation of the femoral tunnel was developed,16 with the notion that drilling of the femoral tunnel independent of the tibial tunnel allows for improved

access to the native origin. This ensures re-creation of both bundles of the ligament, restoring both anteroposterior as well as rotational stability.18 Promising clinical results have been noted with the anteromedial technique,26 and it was recently shown that transtibial femoral tunnel preparation increases the odds of repeat ipsilateral knee surgery.13 In spite of the positive outcomes, apprehension regarding independent femoral tunnel drilling has come to light. In stark contrast to the above mentioned findings, results from the Danish knee ligament registry demonstrated an increased risk of revision after anteromedial compared with transtibial drilling of the femoral tunnel during primary ACL reconstruction.25
In addition to tunnel preparation technique, increased attention has been given to the method of femoral-sided soft tissue graft fixation. At the advent of soft tissue ACL reconstruction, fixation was obtained with interference screws that often damaged the graft. Corticocancellous cross-pin fixation was subsequently designed to circumvent this issue,11 and biomechanical studies showed it to be equivalent or even superior to interference screws.1 However, there have been numerous complications associated with its use, including implant breakage with subsequent graft laxity10 and lateral meniscal tearing,12 intra-articular protrusion,23 iliotibial band friction syndrome,24 medial-sided pin prominence,22 and stress fractures of the femur.5 In light of these concerns, suspensory cortical fixation was developed and has been consequently adopted by many surgeons due to its ease of use. Nevertheless, increased tunnel widening with suspensory as compared with cross-pin fixation has been noted,6,9 resulting in graft loosening with 2 to 3 mm of motion during physiologic loads.21 The purpose of this study was to report a case series of 7 soft tissue graft failures over a short time period after a technical change was made from transtibial drilling with cross-pin fixation to anteromedial drilling with suspensory fixation. Given that there were only 2 graft failures with the prior technique over a 14-year period, we hypothesized that there would be an increased risk of ACL graft failure when using the anteromedial portal technique with cortical suspensory fixation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study. From November 1998 to August 2012, all primary ACL reconstructions were performed by the senior author (W.N.L.) using quadrupled hamstring autograft tendons. The surgical procedure was as follows. An examination under anesthesia was initially performed not only to confirm the diagnosis of an ACL tear but also to assess

for any concomitant injuries such as varus, valgus, or posterolateral instability. After a routine gracilis and semitendinosus harvest, the tendons were taken to the back table and sized and prepared accordingly. There was no pretensioning performed at this stage. Diagnostic arthroscopy was then carried out from an anterolateral portal, and any intra-articular pathology, such as meniscal tears or chondral lesions, were appropriately addressed. Following a minimal notchplasty allowing for visualization of the back wall and stump debridement, a tibial tunnel of equal diameter to the graft was drilled just posterior to the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus. Subsequently, with the knee in 90 of flexion, the appropriate size transtibial over the top positioner allowing for at least 1 mm of back wall was placed on the femur at the 10 and 2 o'clock positions. The beath pin was drilled out the thigh, and a femoral tunnel of the same diameter as the graft was created, measuring approximately 25 to 35 mm in length. The cross-pin drill guide (Biotransfix; Arthrex) was next placed on the femur, and a guide pin was drilled lateral to medial. After reaming of the outer cortex, the guide pin was used to pass a nitinol wire through the femur. The soft tissue graft was passed in routine fashion. After placement of the cross-pin, the graft was assessed for impingement in full flexion and extension. The knee was then cycled 16 times to eliminate creep and placed into full extension. A posterior drawer was applied, and an appropriate size soft tissue interference screw (Intrafix; Mitek) was placed into the tibial tunnel.
From September 2012 to October 2013, a change was made in the surgical technique for primary ACL reconstructions to suspensory fixation. Once again, after an examination under anesthesia and routine hamstring graft harvest, a standard diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out from an anterolateral portal. After addressing any intraarticular pathology, with the knee in 90 of flexion, a far anteromedial portal was made with an 18-gauge spinal needle. Care was taken to avoid iatrogenic injury to the medial femoral condyle while still allowing access to the 10 or 2 o'clock femoral tunnel position. A routine notchplasty was performed, and all soft tissue debris was removed from the ACL origin. The knee was then hyperflexed to 120 and the appropriate size anteromedial over the top positioner (Athrex) was placed, once again allowing for at least 1 mm of remaining back wall. A guide pin was subsequently advanced through the lateral femoral condyle and out through the anterolateral thigh. A low-profile reamer of the same diameter as the graft was placed over the pin and carefully advanced past the medial femoral condyle and PCL and reamed to approximately 25 mm. Next, a shuttle suture was placed onto the guide pin and retrieved through the anterolateral thigh, with the looped end placed within the femoral socket for later retrieval. The knee was then

brought to 90 of flexion, and the tibial guide was placed just posterior to the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus. A solid core reamer of the same diameter as the graft was used to create the tibial tunnel. The suture shuttle was retrieved from the tibial tunnel, and the sutures attached to the suspensory device were placed through the suture shuttle and advanced into the femoral tunnel (RT Tightrope; Arthrex). Fluoroscopy was used to confirm that the button (RT Tightrope; Arthrex) flipped and was secured appropriately on the outer femoral cortex. After the button was secured, the graft was advanced into the femoral tunnel. Arthroscopic visualization was used to confirm lack of impingement in full flexion and extension, and the knee was cycled 16 times and tibial fixation was obtained as described.
Following ACL reconstruction, all patients are placed into a hinged knee brace and physical therapy was initiated according to the standard protocol. The goals for the first 2 weeks of therapy were to eliminate swelling, maintain full extension, and regain quad control. From weeks 2 to 4, the primary goals were to increase range of motion, increase total leg strength, and normalize gait. From weeks 4 to 6, therapy was aimed at normalizing activities of daily living, increasing functional capacity, and increasing strength. Following this, the next 4 weeks were directed at increasing functional strength and normalizing balance and proprioception. Subsequently, weeks 10 to 14 aimed to increase agility and speed of training, normalize strength, and increase muscular endurance. Finally, the principal goals from months 4 to 6 were to allow gradual return to athletic activity by commencing agility drills, running, and cutting. At the 6- to 9-month mark, patients were allowed to return to full activity or competition if they had quadriceps tone equal to the contralateral side and had passed all of the required functional performance tests. From the time of surgery to being cleared to participate in all activities without restrictions, patients were seen in the office every 4 to 6 weeks.
RESULTS
From November 1998 to August 2012, a total of 465 primary ACL reconstructions were performed by the senior

author (W.N.L.) using autologous hamstring tendons. Drilling of the femoral tunnel was performed via the transtibial portal, and femoral graft fixation was achieved with corticocancellous cross-pin fixation. During this 14-year time period, 2 graft failures (0.4% failure rate) were noted. The first failure occurred in a 19-year-old college football player who at the 6-month postoperative visit had significant quadriceps atrophy. Despite not being cleared to resume sporting activities, the patient went on to play basketball and retore his graft. The second failure occurred in a 32year-old woman who reinjured her knee in a skiing accident 5 years after her initial procedure. Of note, the patient was completely asymptomatic and had no residual instability prior to the accident. Furthermore, none of the patients without graft failure had subjective or objective findings of rotational instability after transtibial reconstruction. There were no cases of medial-sided pin prominence or iliotibial band friction syndrome secondary to cross-pin use.
From September 2012 to October 2013, there were 69 primary ACL reconstructions performed by the senior author (W.N.L.) using an accessory anteromedial portal for the preparation of the femoral tunnel along with cortical suspensory femoral fixation. During this 13-month time period, 7 graft failures (10.1% failure rate) were noted (Table 1). These occurred in 5 male and 2 female patients, with a mean age of 18.8 years. All patients were highly competitive high school or college athletes and sustained their initial injuries while participating in their sport. They all underwent physical therapy prior to reconstruction to regain range of motion and quadriceps strength, and underwent surgery at an average of 4 weeks after injury. All 7 patients underwent uncomplicated ACL reconstruction with at the least a size 8 mm-diameter quadrupled hamstring autograft, and none of them had concomitant meniscal or chondral injuries. In addition, there was no compromise of the posterior wall in any cases. The standard postoperative physical therapy protocol, as previously described, was used to guide rehabilitation, and patients were cleared to return to competition at an average of 8.4 months postoperatively. Of the 7 cases, 6 sustained a retear of the graft within 2 weeks of being cleared for full competition, at an average of 8.8 days. The final patient retore the graft 10 months after being cleared to return to sport. In all 7 cases, graft failure occurred while the patient was

competing in their respective sport. Furthermore, in each of the cases, graft failure occurred in the central portion of the graft, corresponding to a midsubstance tear.
DISCUSSION
Residual rotational instability after transtibial ACL reconstruction led to the development of the anteromedial portal technique for femoral tunnel preparation. Proposed advantages of the technique include unconstrained femoral socket placement, and for femoral cannulated interference screw fixation, ensuring parallel socket and screw angle. Furthermore, it is essential for all-inside ACL reconstructions using tibial sockets without full tunnels and for anatomic placement of the posterolateral socket during double-bundle reconstruction.20 Favorable clinical outcomes have been achieved with this technique,3 and in a recent series, ACL reconstruction using a femoral tunnel drilled through an anteromedial portal provided better rotational stability and anterior translation than drilling of the femoral tunnel using the transtibial technique.14 It has also been recently shown that transtibial reconstruction increases the odds of ipsilateral knee surgery relative to the anteromedial portal technique after controlling for patient age and activity level, graft type, and meniscal pathology at the time of reconstruction.13
In contrast to numerous reports demonstrating superior results with independent drilling of the femoral tunnel, the results from our institution demonstrate a higher failure rate with anteromedial versus transtibial drilling (10.1% vs 0.4%, respectively). Recent literature from the Danish Knee Ligament Reconstruction Register parallels our results and noted an increased risk of ACL revision surgery when using the anteromedial portal (5.16%) as compared with the transtibial portal (3.20%).25 These results are similar to a prior meta-analysis comparing the 2 techniques in bone-tendon-bone ACL reconstructions (5.7% vs 2.3% revision rate).2 In a biomechanical study, Xu et al28 showed that an anatomically reconstructed anteromedial bundle had a significantly higher in situ force than a nonanatomically placed bundle. Authors have also shown a decrease in tunnel length19 and an increased risk of posterior wall compromise with the anteromedial technique.7 The authors of the Danish registry attributed the increased load seen by an anatomically reconstructed graft along with a steeper learning curve with technical failures as the source of their increased failure rate.25
Similar to the evolution of femoral tunnel preparation, there has been a paradigm shift in the method of soft tissue graft fixation on the femur. Because of the potential risk of graft damage with interference screw fixation, corticocancelleous cross-pin fixation became popularized.11 Although biomechanical testing demonstrated equivalent to superior results compared with interference screw fixation,1 various complications have also been reported. These include implant breakage,10 intra-articular protrusion,23 and stress fractures of the femur5 among others. Secondary to these concerns, the use of suspensory cortical fixation has dramatically increased over the past 5 years. However, at

our institution, there were no cases of medial-sided pin prominence or iliotibial band friction syndrome. Although suspensory fixation has become popular among many surgeons because of its ease of use and the avoidance of complications associated with interference screw and cross-pin fixation, it is not without its own set of problems. Since the site of fixation is more distant from the intra-articular portion of the graft, there is an increased risk of graft motion with successive tunnel widening.9 This may subsequently predispose the reconstructed knee to increased pathologic motion during physiologic loading,21 increasing the risk of graft failure and damage to the articular cartilage.
As previously mentioned, 2 graft failures (0.4% failure rate) were noted over a 14-year period when ACL reconstructions were performed with transtibial drilling of the

femoral tunnel along with cross-pin femoral soft tissue graft fixation. None of the remaining patients on whom the transtibial technique was performed demonstrated subjective or objective findings of rotational instability, one of the most prevalent criticisms regarding the technique. Of the 2 revisions in the cohort of 465 transtibial patients, the first rupture was the result of premature return to sport, while the other patient reruptured the graft in a skiing accident. After changing the operative technique to include drilling of the femoral tunnel from the anteromedial portal along with suspensory cortical fixation, there were 7 reruptures in 69 patients (10.1% failure rate) over a 13-month period.
We performed a second-look arthroscopy during a separate procedure on a 36-year-old woman who had undergone anteromedial ACL reconstruction with cross-pin fixation 6 months prior but did not rupture her graft. Although the majority of the graft was intact, there was significant fraying of the lateral fibers of the graft (Figure 1). This was likely the result of impingement of the graft on the inferior aspect of the lateral wall. However, during the initial procedure, the lateral wall was debrided so that after graft passage, there was no impingement of the graft after careful examination in both full flexion and extension. It is interesting to note that of the 7 graft failures, 6 occurred within the first 2 weeks that patients were cleared to return to all sporting activities. All 7 graft failures underwent revision ACL reconstruction by the senior author, and all were noted to have a midsubstance tear with a component of lateral wall hypertrophy at the time of their second surgery. Although all patients demonstrated objective signs of healing on physical examination along with successful completion of functional evaluation tests, all failures likely had fraying of the graft similar to that described above, which predisposed them to rerupture. Given that 2 variables were changed, it is difficult to isolate the exact root of the drastically increased failure rate. We believe that the cause is multifactorial and a combination of both technical changes. While neither cross-pin fixation nor suspensory fixation is aperture fixation, the distance from the point of fixation to the intra-articular portion of the graft is significantly more with suspensory fixation, leading to increased graft motion. Our hypothesis as to the increased failure rate is as follows. Since the femoral tunnel is placed further down at the 2 or 10 o'clock position with the anteromedial technique, the graft is significantly closer to the lateral wall than when drilled transtibial. Even if no impingement is noted intraoperatively, the graft is situated within millimeters of the wall. As a result of graft motion and tunnel widening associated with suspensory fixation, there is movement of the graft into a position of lateral wall impingement that may be exacerbated by lateral wall hypertrophy. Repetitive impingement subsequently results in fraying of the graft fibers, causing an alteration in its mechanical properties and resulting in decreased load to failure. While this may not be apparent on clinical examination and functional testing, graft rupture occurs when patients return to high-demand pivoting activities.
As a result of these failures, we have since returned to transtibial drilling of the femoral tunnel with corticocancellous cross-pin fixation. Although independent drilling of

the femoral tunnel affords increased freedom in location, we believe that a properly performed transtibial ACL reconstruction restores anteroposterior as well as rotational stability with equal success. Further biomechanical studies are needed to precisely define the forces seen by the graft with the anteromedial portal technique.
CONCLUSION
The evolution of anatomic ACL reconstruction has led to the development of the anteromedial portal technique for drilling of the femoral tunnel. In addition, concerns regarding interference screw fixation and corticocancellous crosspin fixation of soft tissue grafts have led to the development of suspensory cortical fixation. However, we caution against the use of the 2 in combination, as there has been a significant increase in graft failures at our institution with this technique. We hypothesize that as a result of graft motion and tunnel widening associated with suspensory fixation, there is movement of the graft into a position of impingement on the lateral wall. Subsequently, there is fraying of the fibers of the graft, decreasing its load to failure, and resulting in early graft rupture when patients return to full sporting activities.

Objectives: Intra-articular physeal fractures of the distal femur are an uncommon injury pattern with a high incidence of complications. Only a few small case series have been reported in the literature. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively review patients from three high-volume urban pediatric centers to improve our understanding in the clinical presentation, outcomes, and to assess risk factors for complications. Methods: A retrospective review of all patients presenting to one of three level-one pediatric trauma centers with an intra-articular physeal fracture between 2006 and 2016 was performed. Patient demographic and injury data was documented, including age, gender, skeletal maturity (open versus closing) mechanism of injury, concomitant injuries, sports participation, and whether or not the fracture was missed upon initial evaluation. Radiographs were evaluated for fracture classification (Salter-Harris), location, and displacement. Surgical data was recorded including surgical approach, stabilization technique, and post-operative protocol. Patient outcomes were evaluated including healing, time to union, return to sports, and complications. Factors significantly associated with complications were identified utilizing chi-square test and analysis of variance statistics. Results: A total of 49 patients were identified with a mean age of 13.5 years (range 7-17). The majority were male (88%) and had a Salter-Harris III fracture (84%) involving the medial femoral condyle (88%). Greater than 90% of the injuries were the result of a contact injury and 50% occurred while playing football. The initial diagnosis was missed in 36% of cases. Advanced imaging revealed more displacement than plain radiographs (6 mm vs. 3 mm, respectfully p=0.007). Concomitant ACL and meniscus injuries were present in 12% of patients. All patients underwent surgical fixation with 59% utilizing an arthrotomy, 29% utilizing a percutaneous technique, and 12% using arthroscopic assistance. At a mean follow up of 2 years, all patients had returned to sport and all had "good to excellent" results. A leg length discrepancy was identified in 14% (mean 17 mm) and an angular deformity was identified in 8% (2 varus/2 valgus). 12% of patients required a second procedure for their resultant leg length discrepancy or angular deformity. Complications were more common in patients with open growth plates, patients with fractures involving the lateral femoral condyle, and patients that were casted (p<0.05). Conclusion: Clinicians evaluating skeletally immature adolescent athletes (particularly football players) with acute knee injuries need to keep a high index of suspicion for an intra-articular physeal fracture. These fractures are frequently missed and fracture displacement may be under-reported on plain radiographs. Patients with residual growth, fractures involving the lateral femoral condyle, and patients treated with a cast have a higher incidence of complications. Nevertheless, surgical outcomes are good with high rates of return to sport.

Abstract Introduction. Cerebral palsy (CP) is caused by an injury to the developing brain, and abnormal gross motor function is a hallmark of CP. Properly structured exercises on land have been reported to be effective in improving functional performance in children with CP while only few have been documented on aquatic therapy. Objective. To investigate the effect of a 10-week aquatic exercise training program on gross motor function in children with spastic CP. Methods. Thirty participants aged 1 to 12 years were randomized into the experimental and control groups. Both groups received manual passive stretching and functional training exercises, depending on their level of motor impairment, either in water (temperature 28캜 to 32캜) or on land. Each exercise training session lasted for about 1 hour 40 minutes, twice per week for 10 weeks in both groups. Measurement of gross motor function was done using Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88) at baseline and after 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 10 weeks of intervention. Both groups were compared for differences in change in gross motor function using Mann-Whitney U test. The level of significance was set at P < .05. Results. Only the experimental group showed significant improvement (P < .05) in all dimensions of gross motor function except for walking, running, and jumping (P = .112). Statistically significant difference (P < .05) was found between both groups for all dimensions of gross motor function after 10 weeks of intervention. Conclusion. Aquatic exercise training program is effective in the functional rehabilitation of children with spastic CP.

Introduction
Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disability in childhood and it is associated with lifelong motor impairments.1 It is a disabling condition that affects a child's life and that of his/her family irreversibly, and usually, it is a nonprogressive condition, but improvement over time is challenge.2 CP is a common neurologic problem in children and is reported as occurring in approximately 2 to 2.5 of 1000 live births globally.3 Reports by El-Tallawy et al4 also showed a prevalence of 2 per 1000 births in Africa. In Nigeria, CP is the second most common disorder seen at the pediatric neurology clinics after epilepsy.5,6 Majority (75%) of children with CP suffer from the spastic form.6,7

Abnormal gross and fine motor function and organization, reflecting abnormal motor control, are the core features of CP.8 Loss of selective motor control, abnormal muscle tone, imbalance of power between muscle agonists and antagonists, and impaired body balance mechanisms influence the growth of the child's muscles

and bones, which might result in reduced muscle elasticity, reduced joint range of motion, and disturbed bone and joint development.9 These motor problems can lead to difficulties with walking, feeding, and swallowing; coordinated eye movements; articulation of speech; and secondary problems with musculoskeletal function, behavior, and participation in society.8
A factor that matters most to a child and their family is the ability to perform daily activities.10 Mesterman et al11 reported that 30% to 50% of the Israeli, 8 to 30 years old with CP, require assistance in activities of daily living and for the tasks of dressing, shower, and mobility outside of home, and 50% to 60% of the participants aged below 18 years reported the need for assistance. After achieving a maximum independence level, social function and mobility skills have been reported to deteriorate in youth with CP from the age of 14 years onward.12
Cerebral palsy falls into the category of dynamic disabilities, which means that the physical conditions of individuals with CP can be altered under the influence of physical activities and exercises.13,14 Regular exercise is necessary for the health of children and adults, but in those with CP, the ability to exercise is adversely affected by their motor impairment.1 Various therapeutic exercises, such as strengthening, stretching, balance training, and functional task-oriented training, are commonly used in the rehabilitation of children with CP.15 These exercises, which are mostly carried out on land, have been shown to improve gross motor function in children with a diagnosis of CP.16,17 Despite the wide use of these exercises, some studies have reported challenges accompanying their usage. For instance, a survey carried out in Canada among parents of children with CP demonstrated that stretching was a form of exercise most frequently identified as painful by parents (93% of those reporting pain) and the one with the highest mean pain intensity.18
Aquatic or water intervention is one of the most popular supplementary treatments for children with neuromotor impairments, particularly CP.19 The intervention may provide safe and beneficial alternative low-impact exercise for children with disabilities,20 but there is still lack of evidence-based studies documenting the effects.21 A 2011 systematic review by Blohm22 looked at 8 studies, including 3 randomized controlled trials. All 8 studies reported that aquatic interventions, either as a major component or as a stand-alone intervention, were beneficial for children and adolescents with CP. Benefits reported in the studies included improvement in gross motor skills and maintaining improvements for 3 to 6 months after the intervention, improvement in function including walking efficiency, lower limb muscle strength, balance, and reduced

spasticity. Aquatic therapy is advantageous because water can provide antigravity positioning, as well as buoyancy for weight reduction and decreased compressive forces on joints, resulting in a more fluid active movement for children who would not be able to do certain activities on land.23,24
With the dearth of available evidences showing the effect of aquatic therapy on gross motor function in children with CP, it has become necessary to investigate the effect of a structured aquatic exercise training program on gross motor function in children with CP.
Methods
A total of 30 children not older than 12 years of age who were diagnosed with spastic CP participated in this study. They were recruited from a developmental center in Lagos, Nigeria, where they were undergoing their rehabilitation. They were screened for eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. Children with associated neurodevelopmental conditions were excluded from this study.
Ethical Approval and Informed Consent
Ethical approval was sought and obtained from the Health Research and Ethics Committee of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba, Lagos (Ref No.: ADM/DCST/HREC/APP/1525).
Written informed consents were sought and obtained from the parents of the participants prior to the commencement of the study.
Procedure
Following the permission from the service director of the center, the participants' case files were assessed prior to the commencement of the study to ascertain participants' diagnoses and the type of CP. The participants were assessed by obtaining a detailed history and carrying out physical examination. Sociodemographic data such as age and gender were also obtained from their case files. The participants who met the criteria for the study were then randomly assigned into experimental and control groups. Their mobility level was determined using Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS)-Expanded and Revised, while Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88) was used to measure their gross motor function.
Assessment Protocol
Mobility Level Assessment. This was carried out using the GMFCS-Expanded and Revised according to standard.25

Akinola et al

3

Patients were carefully observed in order to ascertain their mobility level.
Gross Motor Function Assessment.This was carried out using the GMFM-88. Participants were observed for functional performance at various domains of the instrument.
All measurements were taken at baseline, end of fourth week, end of eighth week, and after 10 weeks of intervention. However, the mobility level was only assessed at baseline to describe the participants in terms of their motor impairments. All participants were ensured not to participate in any other form of treatment throughout the period of the study, and parents were advised to report to the researcher any complaints they have about their children at any point during the research period.

Control Group.All participants in the land-based exercise group received same treatment protocol as waterbased exercise group as described above except that all exercises were carried out on land. These exercises also included manual passive stretching and functional training: 2-point kneeling, sitting, standing, and walking, with same frequency and duration as water-based exercise group.
Post-Intervention Assessments
Participants were reassessed at the end of the fourth week, eighth week, and 10th week of intervention for changes in gross motor function using the GMFM-88. All assessments were carried out by blinded assessors who did not participate in the treatment of the participants but were trained on the assessment procedures.

Intervention
All participants in both groups participated in a total of 20 treatment sessions for 10 consecutive weeks of 2 sessions per week. Concomitant use of antispastic drugs in any form was discouraged throughout the study.
Experimental Group. The participants in the experimental group received a treatment protocol adopted from the studies of Salem and Godwin.26 Participants received exercise training in water, 2 times a week for 10 weeks with the exercised parts fully immersed in water. The water temperature was between 28캜 and 32캜 throughout the entire duration of intervention. Two physiotherapists were involved in the treatment of each of the participants in a treatment session. The exercise protocol consisted of 2 categories of exercises as follows.
Exercise 1 (manual passive stretching). This consisted of moving the joint involving the spastic group of muscles passively away from the direction of primary function and holding this position for 60 seconds in fully lengthened position of the muscle groups. This procedure was repeated 5 times for each part giving a total duration of 5 minutes.
Exercise 2 (functional training).All participants were functionally trained according to their level of functional impairment in 4 levels with training in each level lasting for 15 minutes. These 4 levels were the following:
Level 1: 2-point kneeling exercise training Level 2: Sitting education/training Level 3: Standing education/training Level 4: Walking education/training

Data Analysis
Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) 21.0 version for Windows package program was used to perform data analysis. Demographic and quantitative data were expressed in terms of frequency, mean, and standard deviation. Independent t test was used to compare the age of participants in both groups. Friedman test was used to compare the baseline, end of fourth week, eighth week, and 10th week postintervention changes in degree of spasticity and gross motor function of participants within each group, while Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the change in spasticity and gross motor function between both groups. All statistical tests were performed at the .05 level of significance (P < .05).
Results
Both groups did not differ significantly in age and mobility level (Table 1). Comparison of mean rank values of the clinical outcome variables at baseline also revealed no significant difference in gross motor function between both groups (Table 2). There was significant difference in all dimensions of gross motor function (Table 3) among participants in the experimental group. The pattern of change in overall gross motor function across the duration of intervention is compared between both groups in Figure 1.
Discussion
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of aquatic exercise training program on gross motor function in children with CP. Participants in both groups

were similar in age and mobility level as well as in baseline parameters for gross motor function. This suggests that both groups were homogenous and therefore comparable and that results obtained could not be attributed to confounding variables of the participants or to chance.
Of the 30 participants involved in this present study, there was a preponderance of females compared with males (ratio 2.3:1). This finding is not in line with those found in previous similar studies6,27,28 where males were found to predominate. No obvious explanation could be given for the predominance of females compared with males in this study. It is, however, worthy of note that most of these previous studies were conducted in

hospitals while participants for this study were recruited from a developmental center for children.
Majority (86.7%) of the participants recruited for this study were found to be older than 2 years. This counters the report of a study carried in Nigeria by Adekoje et al6 that included participants of the same age range as the present study. They reported that majority (63.4%) of their participants were aged 2 years and below. Other similar previous studies14,16,27,29,30 have also presented contrasting reports of age distribution, which are attributable to difference in inclusion criteria of participants. The findings that most participants in this study were older than 2 years may partly be due to the fact that

developmental centers are not always the first choice for relatives seeking rehabilitation for their children or wards with CP. Therefore, the choice of a developmental center may be due to frustration of relatives as a result of delayed response of their handicapped children to treatment in the hospitals in the first few years of life and had to resort to these centers to relieve them of the burden when most of the children would have been older.
The most predominant type of spastic CP in the present study was the quadriplegic type (83.3%). This is similar to reports from earlier studies in Nigeria.6,31,32 It is, therefore, not surprising that the majority of the participants in the present study had severe motor impairments as reflected by their mobility level that was mostly GMFCS IV (53.3%). On the other hand, reports from studies in other parts of the world showed that diplegic type constituted the majority.14,16,28,29,30 There was no specific reason to account for this variation, but geographical differences may be considered.
The result of this study demonstrated that 10 weeks of aquatic exercise training program brought about significant improvement in gross motor function in the dimensions of lying and rolling, sitting, crawling, and kneeling, and standing as well as in the overall score. This may be attributed to the buoyancy effect of water, which provides antigravity positioning, weight reduction in water, and decreased compressive forces on joints, resulting in more fluid motor function for children who would not be able to do certain activities on

land.22-24 This may consequently make functional training easier in water and may be responsible for the carry over effect in improvement of functional performance on land. These findings have been supported by previous studies.28,30 The study by Chrysagis et al28 found out that a 10-week aquatic training program improved the gross motor function in standing, which is consistent with the findings of this study. Declerck30 also reported significant improvement in motor function following 10 weeks of aquatic training in 14 youths with CP, which was found to translate into functional independence and improved self-care. These previous studies also documented significant improvement in walking, running, and jumping, which is contrary to the findings of this study. This variation may be attributed to methodological differences and inclusion criteria. While their studies both included ambulatory children with CP who could walk with or without support, the present study included both ambulatory and nonambulatory participants with majority not being ambulatory.
Comparison between both the experimental and control groups revealed that there was statistically significant difference on all dimensions of gross motor function in favor of aquatic exercise training program, and this significant difference was not observed until after the 10th week of intervention. This gives credence to aquatic exercise training as a beneficial intervention in the rehabilitation of children with spastic CP.

6

The result from this study, therefore, showed that aquatic exercise training program is effective in the rehabilitation of children with spastic CP. The exercise regimen should, however, be properly structured and extended to at least 10 weeks as done in this study and adhered to, so as to produce desired results.

Conclusion
From the findings of this study, it can be concluded that aquatic exercise training program is a veritable tool for the improvement of gross motor function in children with spastic cerebral palsy.

Abstract Positive patient experiences are associated with illness recovery and adherence to medication. To evaluate the virtual care experience for patients with COVID-19 symptoms as their chief complaints. We conducted a cross-sectional study of the first cohort of patients with COVID-19 symptoms in a virtual clinic. The main end points of this study were visit volume, wait times, visit duration, patient diagnosis, prescriptions received, and satisfaction. Of the 1139 total virtual visits, 212 (24.6%) patients had COVID-19 symptoms. The average wait time (SD) for all visits was 75.5 (121.6) minutes. The average visit duration for visits was 10.5 (4.9) minutes. The highest volume of virtual visits was on Saturdays (39), and the lowest volume was on Friday (19). Patients experienced shorter wait times (SD) on the weekdays 67.1 (106.8) minutes compared to 90.3 (142.6) minutes on the weekends. The most common diagnoses for patients with COVID-19 symptoms were upper respiratory infection. Patient wait times for a telehealth visit varied depending on the time and day of appointment. Long wait times were a major drawback in the patient experience. Based on patient-reported experience, we proposed a list of general, provider, and patient telehealth best practices.

Introduction
Positive patient experiences are associated with illness recovery and adherence to medication (1). On the contrary, suboptimum patient experiences have important implications on patients' health conditions and on health care costs as patients would require more health care services (2,3). Traditionally, patient experience is defined as patientreported encounters and events that occur across the continuum of care (4). In the virtual world, patient experience may be defined differently.
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual care, which is the remote exchange of health information between a patient and provider (5), has become the new norm, temporarily replacing many outpatient services for health care delivery. Virtual visits include telephone and video calls. Social determinants, defined as the conditions with which people are born, grow, live, and work, may play a role in the choice of communication preferred by the patient (6). Young and male patients have a higher chance of choosing a video call over telephone call compared to old or female patients (6).

Differences in workflow between virtual care and inoffice visits can impact patient experience. Workflow is a sequence of tasks performed by different professionals or entities within the system (7). In virtual care, patients do not interact with or rely on other professionals to complete certain tasks. For example, virtual care patients are expected to independently complete the patient registration and to request an on-demand appointment without the need to interact with others. Additionally, patients can choose between telephone and video visit, which required the patient to assess their readiness for a video visit. In the hospital setting, patients are assisted to check-in upon arrival at the clinic by

trained professionals, and if required, patients are scheduled for follow-up visit based on the availability of appointments. Therefore, the workflow processes are different in both environments.
Observational studies have characterized patient experiences and studied the relationship between patient experiences and satisfaction within the traditional, in-person visits (8-10). However, there is limited knowledge describing the patient experience within a virtual care setting especially during a pandemic. The shift toward virtual visits creates a need to understand the opportunities and challenges in providing a patient experience that is at least as positive as in-person visits. In this study, we evaluated the virtual experience for patients with COVID-19 symptoms.
Objective
The goal of this study was to evaluate the virtual care experience of patients of all ages with COVID-19 symptoms as their chief complaints.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study of the first cohort of patients with COVID-19 symptoms in a virtual clinic in a Southeastern medical center where the epidemiological curve has been increasing over time (11). The virtual clinic is an on-demand service, running for 24 hours per day and 7 days per week, that has been in operations since its initiation in 2018 by a major Southeastern health care system (12). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the virtual clinic was in operation for nonemergency symptoms, functioning in the same manner as during the pandemic, and the in-person equivalent of the clinic would be any in-person Urgent Care center. The clinic has provided care to over 8000 patients through board-certified physicians.
Virtual Workflow
The service is open to any patient, regardless of geographic location or healthcare system plan. For patients less than 18 years of age, a parent or guardian is required to accompany them during the virtual visit. In order for individuals to request an appointment with a provider, they are required to register through the online portal. The online portal is available to any individual, regardless of their location of health care system affiliation. The online portal is not currently linked to the institutional electronic health record, although efforts to link both platforms are in progress.
Prior to starting a visit, a patient must create an account and complete their medical history. To ensure continuity of care, if a patient is within the associated health care system, all telemedicine visits will be visible in the patient's electronic medical record. During registration, patients provide demographic information, insurance information, chief complaints, and the pharmacy of choice. Patients have the option

Point scale

to choose from a list of available board-certified physicians who are specialized in the subspecialty related to their chief complaints; otherwise, a random assignment is made based on availability. Physicians were on call for this specific clinic and not assigned to other services.
Once registration is complete and an appointment is requested, patients are either placed in a virtual waiting room or on hold, depending on whether they are registering through the online portal or through a phone call that is operated by a professional staff member. Patients using the phone can hang up and receive a callback.
We extracted the wait time in minutes, which is defined as the time between when an appointment was requested and the start time of the virtual visit. We labeled each appointment as "Completed" if a virtual call was successfully established between the provider and the patient, "Canceled" if the patient requested to cancel an existing appointment, "Missed" if the patient was not present to join the call, and "Patient left wait room" if the patient successfully checked in to the virtual waiting room and then exited the waiting room and did not join the call. Since this is an on-demand service, there is no dedicated slots per hour or per day except if the patient tried to schedule an appointment with a physician who was already booked. In that case, the patient is offered alternative time options for the same physicians or alternative options to other physicians.
During the virtual visit, the patient directly communicated with the physician either via a telephone or video call based on the patient's choice at registration. The clinic did not use a triage mechanism or scoring system to route patients. During the virtual visit, we recorded the duration of the visit from start to end time. Post visit, we asked patients to rate their interaction with their provider and overall visit on a 5-point, displayed in Table 1. Patients could also provide comments on their visits. Patients were also asked where they would alternatively gone to seek care. Participation was voluntary.

Data Collection
We collected data on all virtual visits between March 10, 2020, and April 19, 2020. We stratified COVID-19 data using the chief complaints entered by patients. We included COVID-19 symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) coupled with the recently added "COVID-19 Concern" chief complaint. The term "COVID-19 Concern" was added to the

Khairat et al

667

list of existing chief complaints that is presented to patients during the registration process on March 20, 2020. Because this was a secondary analysis of data, patient consent was not obtained for this study; however, institutional review board approval was obtained prior to this study.
Outcomes
Primary outcomes were visit volume, wait times, visit duration, and patient satisfaction. Secondary outcomes were patient diagnosis, and prescriptions received.
Data analysis
We examined the patient experience of individuals with COVID-19 related symptoms by assessing their Virtual Urgent Care visit. Visits were filtered by patient state of residence, and only patients residing in North Carolina were included. Visits where the chief complaint was "COVID-19 Symptoms" were selected for analysis. We conducted descriptive analysis of the patient experiences as well as qualitative analysis of patient satisfaction survey. All statistical analysis was conducted with Python, a general purpose programming language that is comparable to R. The library pandas was used in Python.
To assess patient outcomes, diagnoses for patients with COVID-19 symptoms were first analyzed and grouped based on International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification codes, and visits with prescriptions were analyzed to examine which prescriptions were given. A demographic analysis was conducted to analyze patient virtual visits. Age groups were defined as: less than 18, 18 to 34, 35 to 49, 50 to 64, and 65 years or older. Patient visits were also grouped by medium (phone/video) and insurance status (insured/uninsured). Subsequent quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted to understand the patient experience.
Patient wait times were analyzed in hourly groups. Encounter duration grouped in minutes were examined in tandem with wait times. Whether a patient was a new patient or returning patient was also assess to understand the reason for a return visit. Patient surveys were analyzed to understand patient satisfaction, and information on where patients would have gone alternatively to seek care were analyzed. For patient satisfaction, the 5-point scales were assessed quantitatively, and a qualitative analysis of patient comments was done. Patient responses for where they would have gone were organized into 4 categories: urgent care, delay seeking care, primary care physician, and emergency room.
Results
Of the 1139 total virtual visits, 212 (24.6%) patients had COVID-19 symptoms such that 125 (59%) patients marked "COVID-19 Concern" as their chief complaint, and 87 (41%) patients had COVID-19 chief complaints. There were 128 (60.4%) female patients, the average age (SD) of

patients was 34.6 (15.7) years, 189 (89.2%) patients were seeking care for themselves, and 23 (10.9%) visits were for a dependent (Table 2). Of COVID-19-related patients, 161 (80%) were between 18 and 49 years of age, and 9 (4.3%) patients in the vulnerable age-group of over 65 years.
Telehealth Modality
Of 212 patients, 195 (92%) were adults (>18 years), 15 (7%) were minors (<18 years), and 2 (1%) were pediatrics (<10 years). Among adult patients, there was substantial preference toward telephone visits such that 160 (75.5%) of patients preferred telephone visit compared to 35 (16.5%) video visit (Figure 1). In patients under 18 years of age, there was a slight preference for telephone visit such that 9 (60%) patients preferred telephone visit compared to 6 (40%) patients choosing video visit. For pediatric patients, there was an even split of a single (50%) telephone visits and 1 (50%) video visit.
Of the COVID-19-related visits, 184 (86.7%) patients were new patients, and 28 (13.2%) were returning patients. Of the new patients, 79 (43%) patients provided medical history information, while for current patients, 11 (39.2%) patients provided medical history information.
Of the 212 scheduled COVID-19 Concern virtual visits, 184 (86.7%) were completed visits, 24 (11.3%) visits were missed because the patient did not answer the clinics call(s), 2 visits were canceled by the patient prior to the visit, and 1 patient left the virtual waiting room.
Call volume, wait times, and duration. The volume of virtual visits fluctuated across 24 hours. Across all visits, most visits occurred between 7 AM and 8 PM with a surge of 18 visits at 4 PM. Between 9 PM and 3 AM, patient's demand for virtual appointment declined, and the lowest number of visits occurred at between 11 PM and 1 AM with only 1 visit (Figure 2). Although the number of visits were much higher between 7 AM and 8 PM, the wait times were considerably lower than other times with fewer visits.

Figure 2. Volume of virtual visits and average patient wait times over 24 hours.

The average wait time (SD) for all visits was 75.5 (121.6) minutes. Patients experienced varying wait times based on the time of their appointment. Patients with appointments between 7 PM and 10 PM and 1 AM and 5 AM experienced the highest wait times with an average of 111.6 minutes and 222.5 minutes, respectively. Patients with appointments between 2 AM and 4 AM had the shortest average wait time of 1.5 minutes (Figure 2).
Weekdays vs weekends. The demand from patients for virtual visits varied during the week. The highest volume of virtual visits was on Saturdays (39), and the lowest volume was on

Friday (19). Patients experienced shorter wait times (SD) on the weekdays 67.1 (106.8) minutes compared to 90.3 (142.6) minutes on the weekends. The highest average wait times were on Sundays (102.5), and the lowest average wait times were on Tuesday (39; Figure 3).
The average visit duration for visits was 10.5 (4.9) minutes. Patients calling on the weekdays experienced a slightly longer visit duration (SD) of 11 (5.2) minutes compared to 9.6 (4.1) minutes on the weekend (Figure 3).
Medical diagnoses and referrals. The most common diagnoses for patients with COVID-19 symptoms were

Patient satisfaction. Overall, 93 (7.8%) patients completed the virtual visit satisfaction survey. Of which, 15 (7.1%) patients were COVID-19 related. Of 15 patients who participated in the satisfaction survey, 7 (46.7%) patients rated their provider as "Excellent", 2 (13.3%) as "Very Good," 1 (6.7%) as "Good," 1 (6.7%) as "Fair," and 1 (13.3%) as "Poor." While 9 (60%) patients rated their virtual provider as "Excellent," 2 (13.3%) as "Good," 2 (13.3%) as "Fair," and 1 (6.7%) as "Poor."
Among the reasons for a positive patient experience were comments related to the convenience of remote consultation without human contact, convenience of out of hour appointments, and avoiding emergency department visit. Factors that lead to a negative experience included long wait time, lack of interpersonal communication, poor telehealth equipment setup, and lack of clarity around ordering COVID-19 testing (Table 4).

upper respiratory infection (URI) 35 (18.8%), exposure to communicable disease 18 (9.7%), bronchitis 16 (8.6%), cough 14 (7.5%), and viral infection 9 (4.8%; Table 3).
Overall, 83 (39.2%) patients received prescription. Of which, 48 (57.8%) patients received 1 prescription medication, and 35 (42.2%) patients received 2 or more prescription medication. Patients diagnosed with URI (25.3%), exposure to communicable diseases (8.4%) and cough, were the highest recipients of prescript medication.
Patients with the same diagnosis experienced different medication prescription outcomes. The range of prescription medication to the eight patients diagnosed with Asthma was 1 to 7 medications per visit. Similarly, the range of prescription for the 16 patients diagnosed with Bronchitis was 0 to 3 per visit.

Discussion
This was the first cross-sectional study evaluating the experience of patients with COVID-19 symptoms in a virtual care environment. We found that all patients who had COVID-19 symptoms were diagnosed differently. Higher utilization of video visits was observed among younger (under 18 years) patients. Patient demand for virtual visits increased on weekend days compared to weekdays. Over 24 hours, the highest volume of visits occurred between 7 AM and 8 PM. The longest wait time occurred between midnight and 6 AM as well as on Sundays. Lack of staff during off peak times possibly resulted in long wait times especially that the volume of visits between midnight and 6 AM was lower than the volume of visits during the day. Approximately, 40% of COVID-19 patients received prescription; however, the prescribing rates varied between COVID-19 concerned patients with similar diagnoses.

"I was able to get a doctor . . . Get medicine for my bronchitis . . . Even though my doctors office had no available appointments and not have to go to ER." (Female, 65)
"Fast, excellent service. Short wait time for call. Live in rural area and walk-in clinics usually have 5-6 hour wait times." (Female, 32)
"My physicians office was closed and I needed a medical consult without having to leave the house. I did not want to risk exposure to COVID-19." (Female, 69)
"The physician I think appropriately treated my compliant, however I could not make eye contact and only saw the top of his forehead and the ceiling." (Female, 58)
"Still have to go to another doctor for medication and to get tested for COVID-19." (Female, 26) "While I understand that wait times are long, it was over 5 hours. There was nowhere to check wait times,
not to cancel the call. I asked the doctor if she was able to order COVID-19 testing." (Female, 47) "Physician rushed me and did not provide clear guidance and direction." (Female, 40)

Patients with COVID-19 symptoms rated their virtual experience with a provider positively. The convenience of no transportation or physical interaction with others was praised by patients. The extra-long wait times, due to an unprecedented volume of calls since the COVID-19 pandemic, were criticized by patients. While wait times were longer due to increased call volume, COVID-19 cases in the community were also rising, which could have led to more COVID-19-related symptoms. Resolving wait times can be fixed by increased staffing; however, the shortage of medical providers for in-person or virtual environments remains a challenge during this time. The relatively low satisfaction survey response rate can be explained by the overall mood of patients with COVID-19 suspicion who may be in a rush to receive care or testing rather than complete the satisfaction survey.
Like the airline industry, virtual clinics should consider the use of callback options during high-volume call times. Additionally, providing an approximated wait time can be incredibly valuable in improving patient satisfaction. Similar to the aviation industry, a customer calling the airline company is presented with an estimated waiting time to connect with a customer service representative.
Some virtual patients complained about feeling rushed in virtual visits, there being a lack of eye contact with their provider or missing clear guidance. Since the shift to virtual care is novel to everyone, virtual care training is essential for both users--patients and providers. A clear set of expectations and virtual care best practices need to be developed and communicated.
Telehealth Best Practices
In addition to the briefly suggested best practices (13), we created a set of telehealth best practices based on patientreported experiences to improve the quality of virtual visits based on the COVID-19 increased workflow, subsequent to data collection. Our recommendations include general, provider, and patient telehealth best-practices.

Generally, in virtual care, there are ways that can improve the telehealth experience regardless of the participant's role. First, unlike in-person visits, participants are advised to use caution with color because wearing shiny fabrics or busy patterns can be distracting and frustrating to the other party. Second, setting the camera at face-level ease eye contact. Third, to keep eye contact with the person you are speaking to, position their icon at the top of the screen (below the camera). Therefore, when you are looking at them and speaking, it will seem like you are looking at the camera. Forth, it is recommended to stay in one place during the virtual visits and to avoid continuous movement. Lastly, if there are loud noises in the background, mute yourself when you are not speaking (Figure 4A).
Additionally, our best practice recommendations include "web-side" etiquettes, comparable to bedside etiquette, for providers such as: (a) focus on eye to eye contact when speaking or listening to the patient; (b) ensure you are in a private and quiet space; (c) physical space is well setup ergonomically with adequate lighting and acoustics; (d) when possible, take notes and minimize typing during the conversation which may add noise to the conversation; (e) guide patients through better set up of their environment (positioning, camera, lightning, and microphone); (f) communicate to the patient the limitations to conducting a physical exam remotely; (g) ask the patient of their virtual care history and reason for choosing virtual care to better understand and manage expectations; (h) expect "lag-time" and therefore allow the patient time to listen, think, and respond; (i) if referring a patient to an in-person appointment, clearly explain the reason for referral and the financial implications, if any; and (j) provider is the only point of contact for the patient, so providers should be more flexible and accommodating when answering questions (Figure 4B).
For patients, it is important to manage and set the expectations prior to a virtual visit. To ensure a positive experience, we recommend best practices for patients: (a) Virtual care does not suit all health conditions such as testing for COVID-19; therefore, it is essential for patients to understand the suitable health care options to avoid unnecessary

costs and/or referrals; (b) during registration, accurate and complete patient information can expedite the workflow process to find the correct and appropriate provider; (c) set your camera to eye level, and when speaking, look directly into the camera and avoid bright light in the background; (d) make sure you are in a private and quiet space; (e) if you have limited internet access consider a phone call instead of video; and (f) the quality of virtual care relies heavily on effective communication of the patient's symptoms and complaints to inform the provider's decision (Figure 4C).
Limitations and Future Work
A limitation to this study is the inability to follow-up with virtual patients on the prognosis of their illness post their virtual visit. We were not able to conduct follow-up visits to assess the clinical outcome of each COVID-19-related visit. The severity of the illness may have been a confounding factor to the varying levels of prescribing among patients with the same diagnosis. Additionally, since COVID-19 testing is not available for patients to self-administer, we were unable to provide any virtual COVID-19 testing to screen for COVID-19 infection, leading to patients being referred for in-person testing. Only 7.1% of patients with COVID-19related chief complaints completed the survey for patient satisfaction. In the future, we plan to evaluate virtual care outcomes through conducting follow-up surveys asking

about the need for hospitalization or in-person appointment post-virtual visit.
Conclusion
This study evaluated the virtual experiences of patients with COVID-19 symptoms. There were different experiences for patients depending on their choice of communication. Long wait times were a major drawback in the patient experience. We have learned from evaluating the experience of our first cohort of COVID-19 Concern patients. This evaluation provided a list of best practices for providers and patients to use during virtual care visits. The future holds great promise for telehealth after the COVID-19 crisis, and thereby, there is a need to optimize telehealth practices in order to make it more sustainable, effective, and meaningful health care delivery medium.

Defined spatiotemporal features of RAS-ERK signals dictate cell fate in MCF-7 mammary epithelial cells

ABSTRACT Signals conveyed through the RAS-ERK pathway are essential for the determination of cell fate. It is well established that signal variability is achieved in the different microenvironments in which signals unfold. It is also known that signal duration is critical for decisions concerning cell commitment. However, it is unclear how RAS-ERK signals integrate time and space in order to elicit a given biological response. To investigate this, we used MCF-7 cells, in which EGF-induced transient ERK activation triggers proliferation, whereas sustained ERK activation in response to heregulin leads to adipocytic differentiation. We found that both proliferative and differentiating signals emanate exclusively from plasma membrane- disordered microdomains. Of interest, the EGF signal can be transformed into a differentiating stimulus by HRAS overexpression, which prolongs ERK activation, but only if HRAS localizes at disordered membrane. On the other hand, HRAS signals emanating from the Golgi complex induce apoptosis and can prevent heregulin-induced differentiation. Our results indicate that within the same cellular context, RAS can exert different, even antagonistic, effects, depending on its sublocalization. Thus cell destiny is defined by the ability of a stimulus to activate RAS at the appropriate sublocalization for an adequate period while avoiding switching on opposing RAS signals.

INTRODUCTION Signals conveyed through the RAS-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) axis (RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase [MEK]-ERK) play critical roles in multiple cellular functions, including cell fate decisions at the proliferation/differentiation/apoptosis crossroads. A large body of data shows that the RAS-ERK pathway operates in the determination of cell destiny by mechanisms that extend beyond its simple on-off status and that subtle variations in

several signal parameters can evoke profound alterations in its biological output (Kholodenko et al., 2010). For example, in mammary epithelial cells, the decision to proliferate depends on ERK's signal amplitude and frequency (Albeck et al., 2013). Signal duration is also critical in the determination of cell commitment. This was initially demonstrated in rat pheochromocytoma PC-12 cells, in which transient ERK activation, stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF), resulted in proliferation, whereas sustained ERK activation, evoked by nerve growth factor (NGF), induced cell differentiation (Traverse et al., 1992). This phenomenon has been observed in multiple cellular models, such as squamous cell lung carcinoma SCC12F cells (McCawley et al., 1999) and Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, in which transient ERK activation resulting from EGF treatment induced proliferation, whereas prolonged ERK activation triggered by HGF led to the acquisition of mesenchymal features, including scattering (Liang and Chen, 2001).
In addition, a wealth of data has led to the abandonment of the view that the RAS-ERK pathway is a unique, linear signaling axis. It is now established that space plays a critical role in the RAS-ERK pathway by providing variability to its signals, depending on the availability of regulatory and effector molecules at the different

tion that exhibits similar kinetics at the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Similarly, disordered membrane platforms are competent for inducing apoptosis. We show that overexpression of HRAS and other constituents of the RAS-ERK pathway leads to the prolongation of EGF-induced ERK activation and that this is sufficient to transform the EGF signal into a differentiating stimulus. Of interest, EGF evokes differentiation only if the overexpressed RAS localizes at disordered membrane microdomains but not at other sublocalizations. However, from the Golgi complex, RAS can induce apoptosis and antagonize differentiation signals. Our results demonstrate that specific spatial and temporal cues are critical for biological output determination as mediated by RAS-ERK signaling.

Overexpression of HRAS transforms EGF signal into a differentiation stimulus The foregoing results indicated that signal kinetics rather than signal localization marked the difference between RAS-ERK- induced proliferative and differentiating outputs. Thus we tested whether by altering signal duration we could transform the EGF-induced proliferative signal into a stimulus evoking differentiation. For this purpose, we overexpressed several members of the RAS-ERK pathway in MCF-7 cells. This resulted in significant prolongation of ERK activation in response to EGF treatment (Figure 7, A and B). Whereas EGF was incapable of inducing differentiation by itself, EGF treatment in cells overexpressing either MEK1 or HRAS evoked significant levels of adipocytic differentiation. To ascertain that HRAS was promoting differentiation via the ERK pathway, we used the HRAS T35S mutant, which signals specifically through such an effector route (Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1997). In agreement, this mutant also elicited significant levels of adipocytic differentiation upon EGF stimulation (Figure 8).
It was of interest to determine whether the nature of EGF signal could be altered by HRAS, depending on its sublocalization. To this end, we used the aforementioned sitespecific HRAS constructs. Of interest, only overexpression of DM-tethered CD8-HRAS led to prolongation of ERK activation in response to EGF; overexpression of either GC KDELr-HRAS or ER-targeted PTP-HRAS was ineffective in this respect (Figure 7, A and B). In agreement, whereas overexpression of CD8-HRAS efficiently facilitated

there (Sanz-Moreno et al., 2003) by preventing its interaction with phosphatases (Casar et al., 2012). To sustain ERK signaling at the cytoplasm, we transfected cells with PEA15, a protein that serves as a cytoplasmic anchor for ERK, preventing its nuclear translocation (Formstecher et al., 2001). Because binding to PEA15 can affect ERK activity in some instances (Mace et al., 2013), we also prolonged ERK cytoplasmic activity by down-regulating the expression of the cytoplasmic phosphatase DUSP-6 using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs; Caunt and Keyse, 2013). Indeed, the presence of MXI2 sustained EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation exclusively at the nucleus, whereas PEA15 overexpression or knockdown of DUSP-6 acted similarly at the cytoplasm (Figure 9A). However, none of these processes was capable of promoting adipocytic differentiation of MCF-7 cells in the presence of EGF (Figure 9B). These results demonstrated that prolonging ERK activation exclusively at the nucleus or at the cytoplasm is not sufficient to trigger differentiation in response to EGF stimulation.

fact that oncogenic RAS induces a potent apoptotic response in MCF-7 cells could help to explain why RAS mutations are so rare in mammary tumors.
Thus our results suggest that because signals evoking different, even antagonistic, outcomes can originate from the same sublocalization, in the case of mammary epithelial cells, the determination of cell fate by RAS-ERK signals would be primarily dictated, not by spatial considerations, but by the duration of the RAS signal: a transient

signal evokes proliferation, a prolonged one leads to differentiation, and a constant signal causes cell death. However, we found that apoptosis can also be potently induced by oncogenic RAS from endomembranes like the GC. Along this line, a recent study showed that oncolytic viruses induce apoptosis by promoting RAS signals at such compartments (Garant et al., 2016). The RAS proapoptotic effect at the GC could explain why proliferative and differentiation stimuli, like those evoked by EGF and HRG, respectively, avoid

activating this RAS pool. In agreement, we showed that activation of endogenous RAS at the GC antagonizes differentiation as induced by HRG. Overall our results indicate that distinct spatiotemporally defined RAS signals can mediate antagonistic biological outputs. Thus, ultimately, cell destiny would be defined by the ability of a stimulus to activate RAS at the appropriate sublocalization for the adequate period of time while avoiding switching on opposing RAS signals.

Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.25% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitor cocktail (1 g/ ml). Lysates were set at a sucrose concentration of 45%. Layers of 3.4 ml of 35% sucrose and 1 ml of 16% sucrose were sequentially overlaid and centrifuged for 18 h at 41,000 rpm (MLS-50 rotor; Beckman, San Diego, CA).

The relationship between genotype mutations and phenotype variations determines health in the short term and evolution over the long term, and it hinges on the action of mutations on fitness. A fundamental difficulty in determining this action, however, is that it depends on the unique context of each mutation, which is complex and often cryptic. As a result, the effect of most genome variations on molecular function and overall fitness remains unknown and stands apart from population genetics theories linking fitness effect to polymorphism frequency. Here, we hypothesize that evolution is a continuous and differentiable physical process coupling genotype to phenotype. This leads to a formal equation for the action of coding mutations on fitness that can be interpreted as a product of the evolutionary importance of the mutated site with the difference in amino acid similarity. Approximations for these terms are readily computable from phylogenetic sequence analysis, and we show mutational, clinical, and population genetic evidence that this action equation predicts the effect of point mutations in vivo and in vitro in diverse proteins, correlates disease-causing gene mutations with morbidity, and determines the frequency of human coding polymorphisms, respectively. Thus, elementary calculus and phylogenetics can be integrated into a perturbation analysis of the evolutionary relationship between genotype and phenotype that quantitatively links point mutations to function and fitness and that opens a new analytic framework for equations of biology. In practice, this work explicitly bridges molecular evolution with population genetics with applications from protein redesign to the clinical assessment of human genetic variations.

Each birth introduces about 70 new human genetic mutations (Keightley 2012) that have led, over generations, to the current four million DNA differences among randomly chosen individuals. Besides insertions, deletions, copy number variations, and chromosomal rearrangements, genetic alterations include single nucleotide substitutions that translate into nearly 10,000 amino acid substitutions per human exome (Ng et al. 2008; Lupski et al. 2010). These protein-coding variants can affect fitness (Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2007), account for 85% of known disease mutations (Choi et al. 2009), and are associated with more than 2500 ailments (Botstein and Risch 2003; Bodmer and Bonilla 2008). Nevertheless, association studies explain only a fraction of disease susceptibility (McCarthy and Hirschhorn 2008), and the role of both private and common mutations remains unclear (Ng et al. 2008). Computational approaches therefore aim to identify which coding variations cause disease (Ng and Henikoff 2001; Stone and Sidow 2005; Adzhubei et al. 2010) within the limitations of biophysical, statistical, and machine-learning models of protein function (Chun and Fay 2009; Hicks et al. 2011). In parallel, a large body of theory models the spread and fixation of mutations (Orr 2005), their distribution for various population sizes and fitness effects (Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2007), and whether selection or drift dominates their fate (Nei 2007). However, without a practical

measure of the action of mutations on fitness, the theory cannot be applied to the massive inflow of genetic information (Orr 2005; Losos et al. 2013).
Here, we follow the perspective that evolution proceeds in infinitesimal mutational steps (Fisher 1930; Orr 2005) to propose an equation for the Evolutionary Action of a mutation on fitness. This action equation is derived from a model of the genotypephenotype relationship that is simpler than current models (Choi et al. 2008; Kleinman et al. 2010; Grahnen et al. 2011) and that is compatible with the theory of nearly neutral evolution (Ohta 1992) and with fundamental variational principles of physics describing how physical systems evolve to follow paths of least action. The computed Evolutionary Action consistently topped the most sophisticated, homology-based or machinelearning methods that predict the impact of mutations in both retrospective and prospective assessments. Retrospective validation included large data sets of (1) experimental assays of molecular function; (2) human disease association; and (3) population-wide polymorphisms. Prospective validation involved the CAGI (Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation) community contest, which challenged predictors to estimate the impact of 84 mutations on enzymatic activity of the cystathionine betasynthase.

The action of protein-coding variations on fitness

Results

A genotype-phenotype perturbation equation
To assess mutations, we treat each one as a small genotype perturbation that may disturb the phenotype. For a protein P, the genotype g is the sequence of n residues (r1, r2, . . ., rn)P, and the global fitness phenotype is a scalar quantity u that integrates all the structural, dynamic, and other functional attributes of P that affect the survival and reproduction of the organism in its milieu (Wright 1932; Smith 1970). As species drift or adapt over time, g and u vary, coupled to each other by a multivariate evolutionary fitness function f, such that f(g) = u, where time and natural selection constraints are implicit. Our central hypothesis is that f exists and is differentiable. If so, a small genotype perturbation dg will trigger a global fitness phenotype variation du given by

du = =f 톎g;

1

where =f is the gradient of f and  denotes the scalar product. In practice, we consider the phenotype variation for a single
missense mutation from amino acid X to any other amino acid Y at sequence position i. Then, the genotype perturbation reduces to the magnitude of that substitution, denoted Dri,X!Y, and the gradient reduces to the partial derivative of the evolutionary fitness function for its ith component, denoted @f/@ri. This last term is the sensitivity of the global fitness phenotype to variations at position i and implicitly accounts for part of the context-dependence at i, that is, the structural and functional role of that position. The remainder of the context-dependence should reside in higher order terms that explicitly represent epistatic interactions with other mutations (Breen et al. 2012). To simplify, we neglect these terms so that the Evolutionary Action (EA, or action for short) of a single substitution on the reference genotype of a species becomes, to a first order:

@f

Du  @ri  Dri;X! Y :

2

In this reduced form, the Evolutionary Action equation states that a point mutation displaces fitness from its current state in proportion to the magnitude of the mutation and to the evolutionary fitness gradient at that site (Fig. 1A). This differential expression is useful because its terms may be evaluated from evolutionary data.
To measure the evolutionary fitness gradient @f/@ri, we rank the importance of every sequence position with the Evolutionary Trace (ET) method (Lichtarge et al. 1996; Mihalek et al. 2004; Wilkins et al. 2013). By definition, a gradient is the ratio of the sensitivity of a function with respect to its coordinates. Here, @f/@ri is the sensitivity of the global fitness phenotype with respect to a mutational step, or simply the fitness difference observed upon variation. This definition points to ET, which ranks every position in a sequence alignment of a protein family as more (or less) important if it varies mostly among major (or minor) evolutionary branches. Since evolutionary branch distances reflect fitness (Coyne and Orr 1998), in effect ET and evolutionary gradient are equivalent concepts and we may choose ET ranks to approximate @f/@ri (Fig. 1B). A frequent and simpler measure of evolutionary importance is residue conservation (Livingstone and Barton 1993; Pei and Grishin 2001; Valdar 2002; Mihalek et al. 2004), but conservation is an average rather than a derivative and is less accurate than ET in practice. In that light, prior ET studies have

already shown the broad applications of evolutionary gradients: They identify functional sites and allosteric pathway residues (Yao et al. 2003), guide mutations that block or reprogram function (Rodriguez et al. 2010), and define structural motifs that predict function on a large scale (Ward et al. 2009; Erdin et al. 2010), such as substrate specificity (Amin et al. 2013).
To measure the magnitude of a substitution Dri,X!Y, we use the relative evolutionary odds of these substitutions (Henikoff and Henikoff 1992; Overington et al. 1992; Koshi and Goldstein 1995). For example, the amino acid alanine is substituted to serine more often than to aspartate, in line with greater biophysical and chemical similarities to the former. Although conceptually independent, we find that the gradient of a position strongly biases its substitution odds. For example, compared to standard, uniform substitution values (Henikoff and Henikoff 1992), alanine positions with large gradients mostly tolerate substitutions to small neutral amino acids, whereas alanine positions with small gradients strongly favor substitutions to large polar or charged amino acids (Fig. 1C). These trends are specific to every amino acid pair: Alanine to valine substitution odds form a bell-shaped distribution as the evolutionary gradient at the mutated position varies from minimum to maximum; those of alanine to threonine begin flat then tail off, whereas those of alanine to aspartate decay steadily (Fig. 1D). These findings are also distinct and complementary to the dependence of substitutions on structural features (Supplemental Fig. 1; Overington et al. 1992; Koshi and Goldstein 1995) and show that the evolutionary gradient at each sequence position is an important factor in substitution bias. Accordingly, we approximate Dri,X!Y by the evolutionary gradient-sensitive substitution odds.
The Evolutionary Action correlates with experimental loss of protein function
For any mutation in a protein with a sufficiently large evolutionary tree, typically more than 20 sequences from a variety of species, we can now apply these approximations for @f/@ri and Dri,X!Y to evaluate a normalized Evolutionary Action, from a neutral value of 0 to a maximum impact value of 100, and then compare this action to the relative changes in function and fitness observed experimentally. First, the Evolutionary Action correlates linearly with the average loss of DNA recombination measured in vivo by P1 phagemediated transduction in 31 E. coli RecA point mutants relative to wild type (Adikesavan et al. 2011), with a Pearson R2 correlation coefficient of 0.87 (Fig. 2A). More broadly, in larger and independent data sets, correlations between the Evolutionary Action and the fraction of dysfunctional mutants in vivo or the average loss of activity in vitro range from 0.73 to 0.96 (Fig. 2B-E) in 4041 lac repressor mutations in E. coli assayed for their impact on b-galactosidase repression (Markiewicz et al. 1994); 2015 lysozyme mutations in bacteriophage T4 assayed for plaque formation due to degradation of the host cell walls by lysozyme (Rennell et al. 1991); 336 HIV-1 protease mutations assayed by the cleavage products (Loeb et al. 1989); and 2314 TP53 mutants assayed for transactivation (see Methods) (Kato et al. 2003). The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is at least 0.98. In lysozyme, two regimes were apparent: Low action mutations minimally affect the phenotype (or the assay), and then there is a steep linear response past some action threshold (Fig. 2C). This lag may be due to the relative insensitivity of the lysozyme assay, which only classified 16% of mutations overall as being deleterious compared to 62%, 53%, and 30% in the lac repressor, HIV protease, and TP53 assays, respectively. In TP53 there is also a lag, but it is small and may

assessed by independent judges also showed that the action equation identified deleterious mutations better than state-of-the-art predictions of mutational effect (Fig. 3B). Together these data span 8500 mutations in eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and viral proteins, and they show that the Evolutionary Action equation quantifies the impact of mutations on assays of function and fitness.

The Evolutionary Action correlates with severity in inherited diseases

Since protein variations of unknown sig-

nificance (VUS) are a recurring problem

in exome interpretation, we asked

whether the Evolutionary Action could

be a biomarker for the impact of pro-

tein mutations on human diseases.

We first assembled a set of 218 genes

from the UniProt database that were

each annotated with both benign and

harmful coding polymorphisms (see

Methods). The Evolutionary Action

distribution was strikingly different be-

tween the mutations that were benign

and those that were harmful, with the

former strongly biased to low action and

the latter strongly biased to large action (Wilcoxon rank-sum P-value < 1016)

(Fig. 4A). As a result, the action separated

the two types of mutations with better

First, a curated and well-characterized study of 103 mutations of the CFTR gene linked them to cystic fibrosis (44 cases); CFTR related disease (53 cases); or benign presentations (six cases) (Dorfman et al. 2010). The median action between these groups was significantly different (Wilcoxon rank-sum P-value = 1.6 3 103) (Fig. 4D), such that high, intermediate, and low action values separated them.

Twenty methods from nine groups were assessed over nine criteria (precision, recall, accuracy, harmonic mean f1, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, Student's t-test P-value, root mean square deviation [RMSD], RMSD over Z-scores, and the AUC) for each cofactor concentration, and then their rank was averaged.

an enzyme encoded by the GAA gene. Known missense mutations of GAA were classified by order of decreasing severity into types B, C, D, and E, ending with nonpathogenic type F (Kroos et al. 2008). The median action of GAA mutations rose significantly with clinical severity (Wilcoxon rank-sum P-value = 5 3 106), being in the top half for pathogenic types B-E, but in the bottom half for nonpathogenic type F (Fig. 4E). These data show that in two different diseases the Evolutionary Action of mutations in causative genes is related to morbidity.
Action reflects the fitness effect of population-wide polymorphisms
If action is a general biomarker of morbidity or fitness effect, then we would expect the population to carry fewer coding polymorphisms with larger action. Indeed, long-standing population genetics models suggest that the probability of polymorphisms to remain in a population decreases nearly exponentially with their fitness effects (Fisher 1930), although without a practical measure for the size of the phenotypic effect, validation in genomic data has been lacking (Orr 2005). Thus, to test the generality of the action equation, we tallied the frequency of coding polymorphisms from the 1000 Genomes Project (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium 2012) as a function of their action. The 261,899 unique coding variations were divided into common mutations (36,379 SNPs with allele frequencies above 1%) and into rare mutations (225,520 SNVs, with allele frequencies below 1%). Without special regard for zygosity, dominance, genetic background, or trait associations, and in contrast to other measures of

deleterious impact (Supplemental Fig. 3A,B), we found that the action distribution was nearly exponential in both groups (R2 = 0.98 and 0.95, respectively) (Fig. 5A), but the decay or loss rate, denoted by l, was larger for common than for rare mutations. To investigate these different loss rates, the variations were grouped more finely by their allele frequency, denoted by n (Fig. 5B). This revealed a family of exponential distributions with loss rates that were log-linear in n:

l = a + b  lnv;

3

where a = 4.5 3 102 and b = 3.2 3 103 fit these distributions with correlation coefficient R2 = 0.92 (Fig. 5C). These data support the Evolutionary Action as a general measure of fitness effect and show that the human coding variations from the 1000 Genomes Project are distributed as a nearly exponential function of the action modulated by a power law function of allele frequency:

N = N0  e픩핤ction = N0  e픞핤ction  v픟핤ction;

4

where N is the fraction of mutations of a given allele frequency, N0 = 0.2, and the loss rate l is a scaling factor for the selective constraints on mutations with different actions (Hartl and Taubes 1996).
Coding variations found in single cells, in individuals, and in populations are ensembles of variants that span a wide range of different allele frequencies. The overall action distribution of these different ensembles, however, is also nearly exponential with a loss rate l unique to each one (Supplemental Fig. 3C). For example, l is largest in an individual's exome, but it decreases by 40% over a group of individuals, such as the entire set of variations from

1092 individuals sequenced in the 1000 Genomes Project, and it decreases by 73% over the set of all somatic cancer mutations described in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al. 2013). These data show that ensemblespecific loss rates are dominated by common polymorphisms for an individual's exome, by rare variants over a population such as the group of the 1000 Genomes Project exomes, and by random nucleotide changes in somatic cancer tissue from TCGA (Fig. 5C).
Discussion
A fundamental problem in evolution is to quantify how genotype variations drive phenotype variations. This work therefore applied elementary mathematical concepts from differential analysis to formulate an equation of evolution. The result is a computable first order Evolutionary Action equation for the effect of genotype perturbations on fitness. At the molecular level, the action estimates the deleterious impact of substitutions in proteins from viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotes. In individuals, this deleterious impact measured by the Evolutionary Action correlates with the pathogenicity and clinical course of mutations in disease-causing genes, and it separates genes with harmful versus neutral mutations by their different action distributions. The action threshold for clinical consequences may differ depending on the essentiality, allelic dominance, and external factors specific to each protein. Finally, over a population, the greater clinical harm associated with larger Evolutionary Action governs the purifying selection of coding polymorphisms, notably recovering the distribution of fitness effect anticipated by Fisher in 1930 and consistent with population genetics models (Fisher 1930; Orr 2005). Thus, the Evolutionary Action equation quantitatively bridges the phenotypic fitness effects of mutations across molecular, clinical, and population genetics data.
This Evolutionary Action equation rests on the fact that =f(x)햏x = dy for any differentiable function f(x) = y and on the postulate that the genotype g and the fitness phenotype u can stand for x and y, respectively, and be related by a differentiable evolutionary function f. For missense mutations, the genotype variation dg is the difference in amino acid similarity, estimated by substitution odds, and the partial derivative components of the gradient =f is the sensitivity of fitness to mutations, estimated by the evolutionary importance of each sequence residue. Although evolutionary importance is often conflated with conservation, in the context of differential analysis, an average, such as conservation, is less accurate than ET, which directly uses phylogenetic analysis to couple variations in sequence to variations in fitness, as a derivative should, since by definition derivatives are ratios of variations. The fact that ET measures a fundamental evolutionary quantity, =f, is consistent with its accuracy and versatility to predict, selectively block, redesign, or mimic protein function by pinpointing the amino acid determinants of specificity (Yao et al. 2003; Rodriguez et al. 2010; Amin et al. 2013). To improve substitution odds, we likewise used phylogenetic analysis by considering the evolutionary gradient of the substituted site. Both terms, =f and dg, contribute to the impact of a mutation since each one separates deleterious from neutral mutations if the other is held nearly constant (Supplemental Fig. 4).
It is noteworthy that the evolutionary fitness function f between genotype and phenotype is never solved for. It suffices to evaluate =f because the perturbation approach treats mutations as infinitesimal displacements from the current fitness state of a spe-

Figure 5. Nearly exponential action distributions of human coding polymorphisms. (A) Coding polymorphisms from the 1000 Genomes Project (including 1092 individuals) were separated into 225,751 rare variants (left) and 36,354 common mutations (right), based on an allele frequency (n) threshold of 1%. Both groups fit exponential distributions with Pearson coefficients R2 of 0.95 and 0.98 and decay rates of 2.18 3 102 and 3.38 3 102, respectively, when binned into action deciles. The insets show equivalent log-linear plots. (B) These groups were further fractionated by allele count or frequency. The action distribution of polymorphisms in the same tranche of allele count, or frequency, also fit an exponential with R2 values from 0.87 to 0.99. The colors represent different Evolutionary Action (green for low and red for high). (C ) The action decay rate for these exponentials varies linearly with the logarithm of their allele frequency (R2 value of 0.92). Arrows indicate the observed decay rates for all nonsynonymous coding mutations from a single individual's exome; for the rare and the common mutations of the 1000 Genomes Project; for somatic cancer mutations retrieved from TCGA (http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov); and for nonsynonymous mutations obtained by the translation of random nucleotide changes following the standard genetic code (random nucleotides).
cies. This shifts the focus from discovering global evolutionary paths in the fitness landscape, tantamount to solving f and predicting protein structure and function from sequence, to evaluating the path divergences du as a sequence mutates and ``jumps'' in the fitness landscape. Computing these jumps requires solving Eq. (2), which is simpler because the phylogenetic divergence tree provides an integrative summary of the impact of mutations over all past relevant molecular, cellular, systemic, and environmental interactions even if the details of these features remain unknown.

Katsonis and Lichtarge

In the future, it may be possible to improve accuracy with additional higher-order perturbation terms that account for epistatic effects. Another source for improvements is that, although =f and dg are computed over the past evolutionary record, their product informs on the Evolutionary Action of mutations du at any point in time, including today. In other words, the fitness metric and the action of a mutation are assumed to be time-invariant. This is an approximation since divergent proteins can develop new functional sites, a phenomena that leads to branch-specific evolutionary gradient variations and accounted for by differential ET (Lichtarge et al. 1997), for example, to identify ligand-specific sites (Madabushi et al. 2004; Rodriguez et al. 2010).
Despite its simplicity and these limitations, the Evolutionary Action equation matches experimental data as well as or better than the most sophisticated current machine-learning and statistical methods, and when applied to the 1000 Genomes Project data, it brings to light fine details and new parameters for the distribution of polymorphisms. First, the strength of selective constraints against mutations with large fitness effects is specified by l, the exponential loss rate constant of the Evolutionary Action distribution. This loss rate is greatest in individuals, consistent with selective pressure to carry few detrimental mutations. It is smaller in a population, where rare variations may accumulate in unrelated individuals for better overall adaptive potential. And l is least and reaches the lower limit set by the codon bias itself in diverse cancer cells, in which the large background of random passenger mutations obscures the rare cancer driving mutations. Second, as polymorphisms spread in a population the loss rate l grows linearly at a rate of b until it peaks, at fixation, with lmax = a, when n = 1. Thus, a and b are basic parameters of evolutionary drift and adaptation. For the same value of a, species with larger b experience less selective forces against new, larger deviations from neutral alleles, which may increase the pool of variations underlying genetic drift and possible adaptation. Reciprocally, for the same value of b, species with larger a have relatively greater selective forces against larger deviations from neutral alleles, lowering possibilities for drift and adaptation. Since the mutation rate is subject to molecular and selection factors (Shee et al. 2012), one may speculate whether similar factors might modulate a and b, and underlie shifts between evolutionary quiescence and bursts.
More certain is that mutations with greater action are at increasing selective disadvantage and that fixation should mostly favor polymorphisms with least action (Fig. 5A,B), consistent with the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution (Ohta 1992). This is also true when comparing the Evolutionary Action differences among pairs of homologous proteins as they diverge further apart. Indeed, homologs that are evolutionarily closer, based on sequence identity, consistently exhibit lower overall, as well as average, action differences (Supplemental Fig. 5). Therefore the genotype-phenotype trajectory should follow a path of nearly least Evolutionary Action, with the frequency of larger deviations from least action attenuating exponentially as dictated by the loss rate l. The emergence of least action as a fundamental evolutionary constraint is intriguing and suggests a convergence between evolution in biological systems and familiar variational principles in physics.
For now, starting with elementary calculus and a reductive view of biology that u = f(g), we show a first principle perturbation equation for the Evolutionary Action of genotype variations on functional fitness phenotype that robustly matches data across biological scales and clades. This opens new directions for the formal analysis of evolution and, in practice, sheds light on the analysis of coding variations, with applications to biological en-

gineering, to genome interpretation, and to disease surveillance and personalized therapy based on individual and comparative mutational action profiles.
Methods
Calculation of action
The action Du was calculated by the product of the evolutionary gradient @f/@ri and the perturbation magnitude of the substitution, Dri,X!Y. These two terms, @f/@ri and Dri,X!Y, were measured by importance ranks of the Evolutionary Trace method and by amino acid substitution odds, respectively, as described below. We normalized both terms and their product to become percentile scores for each protein. Therefore, high or low action indicated deleterious or neutral assessment, respectively, such that, for example, an action of 68 implied that the impact was higher than 68% of all possible amino acid substitutions in a protein.
To compute the evolutionary gradient for position i of protein P, we retrieved its homologs in three databases (NCBI nr, the UniRef100, and the UniRef90 [Suzek et al. 2007]) with blastall 2.2.15. Up to 5000 homologous sequences were selected each time with an e-value cutoff set to 105, the minimum sequence identity set to 30%, and all other parameters set to default values. Sequences were aligned with MUSCLE (Edgar 2004) (http://drive5. com/muscle/), and the columns with gap in the query sequence were removed. Then, we ran the rvET method (Mihalek et al. 2004), which optimizes sequence selection by maximizing the spatial clustering among top-ranked residues (Madabushi et al. 2002) and their rank information (Yao et al. 2006), and we averaged the ET scores produced on each of these three alignments. We computed substitution log-odds following the BLOSUM methodology (Henikoff and Henikoff 1992), with the difference that the odds were computed separately depending on the evolutionary gradient of the substituted position. For this, we assembled as above over 67,000 multiple sequence alignments for proteins available in the PDB database (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/), and we computed an evolutionary gradient for each position of each alignment. These positions were divided into 10 groups (gradient deciles), and the substitution odds were computed for each group, as described below. An additional structure-dependent set of substitution matrices further divided each gradient decile into nine groups: into low (< 10 A 2), medium (10-50 A 2), and high solvent accessibility (> 50 A 2), and also into helical, stranded, and coiled secondary structure elements. Finer bins of substitution odds may better distinguish the selection constraints that are less common in protein evolution, such as for transmembrane patches (Soyer et al. 2003).
Calculation of the substitution log-odds
Let fijc be the total number of matches between amino acid i (1 # i # 20) to any amino acid j (1 # j # 20) when i is the most frequent amino acid in a column of class c (1 # c # 10 or 1 # c # 90). Then the observed frequency, qijc, for substituting the amino acid i by j in class c is
qijc = fijc : + fijc
j
The probability of occurrence of the amino acid j in the data set is

Unlike the BLOSUM methodology, log-odds were not rounded to the nearest integer.
Current predictors of mutation impact
SIFT predictions were obtained using ``SIFT BLink'' (http://sift.jcvi. org/). MAPP predictions were obtained after installing the software (http://mendel.stanford.edu/SidowLab/downloads/MAPP/) using sequence alignments from the UniRef90 database as input. The ``P-value interpretations of the MAPP scores'' were used as the impact. PolyPhen-2 predictions were obtained using the default parameters of the batch query tab at http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/.
Statistics The x2 test was used to calculate the P-value of the overlap between action and clinical association or yeast assay activity of TP53 mutations. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the distributions of disease and benign polymorphisms for the data set of UniProt mutations and of the TP53, CFTR, and GAA genes.
Experimental data sets
The set of 31 E. coli RecA mutations was assayed in Adikesavan et al. (2011) for its recombination activity as a percent of the wild-type activity. The mutations were binned in 10 action groups and the average recombination was calculated. The set of 2015 bacteriophage T4 lysozyme mutations was assayed in Rennell et al. (1991) by the amount of formed plaque, due to lysozyme's break-up of the host cell walls. Mutants with no () and difficult to discern (/+) plaque formation were considered as deleterious, while mutants with normal (+) and small plaque formation (+/) were considered as neutral. The set of 4041 E. coli lac repressor mutations were assayed in Markiewicz et al. (1994) by the protein's repression activity. Mutations with phenotypes less than 20-fold ( and /+) repression activity were considered as deleterious, while mutants with more than 20-fold (+ and +/) repression activity were considered as neutral. The set of 336 HIV-1 protease mutations were assayed in Loeb et al. (1989) by the amount of cleavage products of Gag and Gag-Pol precursor proteins. Mutants with no () and some (/+) product were considered as deleterious, while mutants with normal (+) function were considered as neutral. The set of 2314 TP53 mutations were assayed in yeast for transactivation on eight TP53 response-elements (Kato et al. 2003). Values > 100% in any assay were treated as equal to 100%. Then, we calculated the average transactivation, and we grouped the mutants with < 50% of wild-type activity as deleterious and the rest as neutral.
The 26,597 TP53 tumor mutations were obtained from the IARC TP53 database (version R14) (Petitjean et al. 2007), and they were divided into 342 recurrent mutations (at least 10 times) and 1023 nonrecurrent mutations (nine times or less). The 9347 human mutations on disease-associated genes were obtained from the UniProt database (http://www.uniprot.org/) after we roughly classified each as neutral if it was annotated by the keywords ``dbSNP,'' ``polymorphism,'' and ``VAR_'' or as disease-associated otherwise. From 20,343 human genes, 70% (11,995) had at least one SNP entry and only 15% (3023) had at least one disease-

association entry. We selected genes with at least 10 mutations associated with the same disease, which had at most 10 mutations marked as ``Uncertain pathogenicity.'' For the resulting 218 genes, we inspected and corrected the rough classification and removed mutations associated with uncertain pathogenicity and sporadic cancers. The GAA missense mutations and their Pompe's disease severity classification were obtained from http://cluster15. erasmusmc.nl/klgn/pompe/mutations.html. The 278,179 human polymorphisms were obtained from the phase 1 analysis of the 1000 Genomes Project, at http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ ftp/phase1/analysis_results/input_call_sets/. The somatic cancer mutations were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) at http://cancergenome.nih.gov/.

ABSTRACT

Introduction: There have been no prospective

clinical studies investigating adherence and

tolerability of HIV post-exposure prophylaxis

(PEP) in China. Tolerability, adherence, and

transmitted drug resistance are concerns, espe-

cially when single-tablet regimen (STR) usage is

low. The present study aimed to explore the

safety, tolerability, and adherence of regimens

containing albuvirtide (ABT) compared with

recommended non-STR antiretrovirals for HIV

PEP.

Methods: This was a prospective, open-label,

multicenter cohort study. The subjects were

stratified into 3 groups based on their prefer-

ence: ABT ? Dolutegravir (DTG) (Group 1),

ABT ? Tenofovir

disoproxil

fumarate

(TDF) ? Lamivudine (3TC) (Group 2), and

DTG ? TDF ? 3TC (Group 3). All enrolled sub-

jects received PEP within 72 h after exposure

and continued for 28 days, and were followed-

up for 12 weeks.

Results: A total of 330 participants were enrol-

led in the three groups. Most participants were

male (87.2%). Sexual contact was the most fre-

quent mode of exposure (91.9%). The average

time from exposure to treatment was

26.8  19.5 h. There were no statistically sig-

nificant differences between the three study

groups with respect to completion of oral

medication at 28 days. The 28-day completion

rate was shown to be significantly higher with

ABT versus oral (88.9% vs. 64.0%; p\0.0001),

and adherence with ABT was 94.4% compared

to 75.7% with oral PEP (p\0.0001). Subjects in

ABT-containing Group 1 exhibited higher

adherence than those in Group 3 (87.3% vs.

72.9%; p\0.05). None of the participants

reported serious adverse drug reactions which

led to withdrawal from the study. All the drug

regimens were found to be safe and well toler-

ated. No HIV incident case was observed during

the study period.

Conclusions: ABT-containing

regimens

(ABT ? DTG or ABT ? TDF ? 3TC) offer a good

option for HIV PEP due to higher completion

rates and adherence than the DTG ? TDF ? 3TC

regimen. The overall safety was comparable and

acceptable among the three groups.

INTRODUCTION
Global HIV/AIDS statistics estimate that there are approximately 38 million people living with HIV worldwide at the end of 2019, with about 1.7 million new infections and 690,000 deaths occurring in 2019 [1, 2]. In China, AIDS morbidity (1/100,000), mortality (1/100), and HIV new infection rates (1/100,000) increased from 0.235 to 3.990, from 0.057 to 1.034, and from 1.020 to 6.442, respectively, from 2004 to 2016,

despite the country's unremitting efforts [3]. Currently, some of the strategies developed specifically for HIV prevention in China have included treatment as prevention (TasP), active work towards the WHO 90-90-90 targets, preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), detection and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), prevention of mother-to-child transmission, promotion of condom use, and safe blood donation [4]. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is considered the best option for TasP and PEP to prevent HIV transmission and infection [5].
According to recommendations of the International Antiviral Society-USA panel and China AIDS Guidelines (2018 edition), ART should be provided immediately to newly exposed individuals to avoid HIV transmission. Dolutegravir (DTG), lamivudine (3TC), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), bictegravir (BIC), and emtricitabine (FTC) are the recommended drugs for HIV PEP by current guidelines [6, 7]. Three-drug regimens, including threedrug single-tablet regimens (STRs), are usually recommended as PEP regimens for high-risk individuals. However, STRs are not widely available in China, and adherence is always a concern when using non-STR three-drug ART for HIV PEP. Additionally, given the importance of PEP and the more than 100,000 new reported HIV infections annually in China, there has been no prospective PEP clinical study conducted in China to date [3], and international studies mentioned below have not included Chinese participants.
The effectiveness of PEP has been demonstrated in several previous overseas studies, but poor adherence and low completion rates were concerning observations in those studies which warrant further improvement [8-10]. There is a demand for PEP regimens that could overcome challenges of poor adherence, severe adverse events, and dosing convenience. Two previous overseas studies using co-formulated STRs (elvitegravir/cobicistat/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine) of HIV PEP found that the majority of participants achieved a higher drug completion rate ([70%) and favorable drug tolerance [11, 12]. However, these studies did not include Chinese participants or cohorts,

Infect Dis Ther (2021) 10:2611-2623

2613

and the real-world usage of these STRs in China was low.
Using parenteral long-acting antiretrovirals may be another strategy for improving adherence, tolerability, and convenience, and thereby have the potential to enhance expected outcomes. Preliminary animal PrEP studies have shown that long-acting cabotegravir can prevent simian/HIV acquisition from rectal, vaginal, and intravenous challenge [13]. Another study has demonstrated that monthly administration of long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine was non-inferior to daily oral administration of TDF/FTC for PrEP in mice [14]. In the HPTN083 and HPTN084 studies, cabotegravir showed superiority to oral TDF/ FTC for HIV PrEP in males having sex with men and cisgender women [15, 16].
Albuvirtide (ABT) is a long-acting 3-maleimimidopropionic acid (MPA)-modified peptide that binds to human serum albumin and inhibits HIV fusion. The binding of ABT with serum albumin to form a conjugate is responsible for its extended half-life of 12 days [17, 18], and it reduces the need for frequent intravenous administration [19]. The phase 3 TALENT study indicated that the dual regimen of ABT (weekly infusion) and oral daily ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) was well tolerated and non-inferior to the WHO-recommended second-line three-drug regimen in HIV patients with firstline treatment failure [20]. ABT was approved by the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for marketing in 2018. In realworld practice, it is widely used in patients with HIV-1 infection and has been proven to have good safety and effectiveness. Due to the unique features of ABT, such as long-acting, intravenous administration, not metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes, and subsequently fewer drug-drug interactions, the real-world clinical application has extended to special populations with high unmet medical needs, such as patients with hepatic impairment or renal impairment, perioperative use for abdominal surgery, hospitalized patients with critical conditions, and treatment-na쮑ve HIV-infected patients with or without AIDS [21-23].
Due to the low usage of STRs in China, there have been concerns about the existing ART

options in real-world PEP practice, such as the lower adherence and pill burden of non-STR regimens. Therefore, it is of interest to generate evidence of better options, including the newly approved long-acting injectable fusion inhibitor for PEP. The present study aimed to explore the safety, tolerability, adherence, and effectiveness of co-administration of ABT with other non-STR antiretrovirals for HIV PEP. Subjects were treated with 2 injections (1st and 15th days) of ABT combined with 1 integrase inhibitor or 2 nucleotide/nucleosides (NRTIs). Compared to the traditional three-drug non-STR PEP treatment, we hypothesize that once every 2 weeks ABT-containing regimens may offer a better therapeutic option by reducing pill burden and improving adherence, and the potential benefits of ABT use in PEP may be associated with the fact that it blocks viral fusion and acts early in the viral life cycle, reaches inhibitory drug concentration rapidly in blood via injection, and exhibits a high resistance barrier and long half-life of 12 days.

METHODS
Study Design and Participants

This was a prospective, open-label, multicenter

cohort study conducted at three clinical centers

in China: Chongqing Public Health Medical

Center, Kunming Third People's Hospital, and

The First Hospital of Changsha. Randomized

design was not considered for the present study

due to the potential implementational and

analytical complexity involved with using both

intravenous and oral drugs in the intervention

arms. It was thus decided to conduct an

exploratory open-label cohort study as the first

study with respect to this specific study area in

China. The three treatment options were

offered to patients, and participants chose a

therapeutic option based on their preference.

The study was registered in Chinese Clinical

Trial Registry with registration number

(ChiCTR1900022881, http://www.chictr.org.

cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=37395),

was

approved by the Ethics Committees at each of

the participating centers, and was conducted in

2614

Infect Dis Ther (2021) 10:2611-2623

accordance with the tenets of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent.
Subjects with HIV exposure visiting these clinical centers between May 2019 and December 2019 were enrolled for the study. All subjects were asked to provide their history of exposure. A rapid HIV antibody examination was performed for all the subjects within 72 h of exposure to initiate the first preventive drug use. The inclusion criteria included: (1) persons above 18 years of age; (2) with a history of HIV exposure within 72 h through damaged skinstabbing or cuts and/or contaminated skin/mucous membrane or unprotected sexual intercourse with a suspected or confirmed HIVpositive person; (3) tested negative for HIV antibody and urine pregnancy testing after exposure; and (4) provided signed informed consent. Urine pregnancy tests were performed only for women. The exclusion criteria were persons living with HIV or co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), those with exposure exceeded 72 h, those who had an allergic reaction history or were intolerant to PEP drugs or excipients, and pregnant or breast-feeding women or women planning a pregnancy.
The subjects were stratified into 3 groups based on their preference: ABT ? DTG (Group 1), ABT ? TDF ? 3TC (Group 2), and DTG ? TDF ? 3TC (Group 3). Subjects were initially screened, and, if they were found to have renal disease, they were to be allocated to the non-TDF arms of our study. However, we did not have any subjects with renal disease in our cohort. Group 1 and 2 regimens were designed based on the potential benefits of ABT from real-world clinical experience [21-23], while Group 3 was the regimen recommended by the China AIDS Guidelines. All enrolled subjects received PEP within 72 h after exposure and PEP was continued for 28 days,; patients were followed-up for 12 weeks. All the recruited subjects were appropriately educated by attending doctors with respect to the importance of adherence of PEP, and were reminded by the doctors 2-3 days before the next followup visit. The primary measurements were the 28-day drug completion rate and adherence,

HIV sero-conversion, and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADR).
Study Procedure
Based on the principle of starting prophylactic medication as early as possible after high-risk HIV exposure, the collection of high-risk exposure history, informed consent, HIV antibody test results, urine pregnancy test results (only for women), vital signs, and physical examinations were completed rapidly, and the first preventive dose of medication was administered within 72 h after exposure.
The drugs utilized in the present study and their respective dosages were as follows: ABT, 320 mg, given intravenously (IV) on day 1 and day 15; DTG, 50 mg, taken orally, once a day for 28 days; TDF, 300 mg, orally once a day, for 28 days; and 3TC, 300 mg, orally, once a day, for 28 days. Post-exposure prophylactic therapy was initiated in all the subjects within 72 h of exposure. Oral study medication was dispensed for 28 days, and subjects were followed up for 12 weeks.
The results of laboratory examinations at the Day 1 visit (blood cell count, biochemistry, urinalysis, HBV markers, hepatitis C antibody, and syphilis markers) were used as baseline data. Follow-up visits were conducted on Day 14 and Day 28, and Week 8 and Week 12 to evaluate blood-testing results and urinalysis, drug adherence, ADR, anti-HIV antibody test, vital signs, and physical examination.
Based on drug distribution records, study doctors calculated the percentage of subjects who completed the 28-day course of ABT and oral prophylaxis drug regimens. The subjects received ABT by the study nurse via IV-infusion at the hospital. The infusion was documented in the hospital database, and these data were included in the calculation of adherence. Oral drug adherence (actual doses/theoretical doses 9 100%) was measured by pill counts at each study visit.
The 28-day individual adherence rates to ABT and each of the oral drugs were calculated concurrently, and the adherence rates to each regimen were calculated at the same time. In

Infect Dis Ther (2021) 10:2611-2623

2615

the two-drug regimen of Group 1, each drug was weighted as  weights, while in the three-drug regimens of Groups 2 and 3, each drug was weighted as 1/3 weights. The effectiveness of prophylaxis was evaluated by calculating the HIV infection rates at 28 days and 12 weeks. Safety evaluation included recording and evaluating the incidence of ADR, physical examination, and the results of laboratory tests, such as hematology, blood biochemistry, and urinalysis.
Outcomes
The primary measurements were the 28-day drug completion rate, adherence, HIV seroconversion, and occurrence of ADRs. The percentage of subjects who had completed 28 days of ABT and oral PEP medications was calculated based on drug distribution records. The 28-day drug adherence rate to ABT and the oral drugs was calculated, and the regimen adherence rate of the three groups was calculated. The formula used to calculate drug adherence (%) was consumed doses/prescribed doses 9 100%. Safety endpoints included the recording and evaluation of the occurrence of ADRs. The HIV seroconversion included the HIV infection rate at Day 28 and Week 12.
Statistical analysis
Assuming that the true population drug completion rate of the Group 3 regimen is 70%, a sample size of 100 participants per treatment group is expected to provide approximately 80% power if the ABT regimen has a true drug completion rate 16% higher than the Group 3 regimen, at a nominal two-sided level of 0.05. Similarly, a sample size of 100 participants per treatment group provides approximately 80% power when the ABT regimen has a true drug adherence rate exceeding that of the Group 3 regimen by 0.12 (or 12%), assuming the true standard deviation to be 0.3 for all groups, at a nominal two-sided level of 0.05.
Continuous datasets were described as mean  standard deviation, and classified datasets as percentage and event frequency. The v2

test and Fisher's exact test were performed to compare categorical variables. Continuous variables were compared using the paired t test and the F test (analysis of variance) was used for multiple comparisons with T correction. Statistical significance was set at a p value of 0.05, and CIs at 95%. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (v.9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The Safety Set (SS) included all subjects who received the assigned PEP medications. The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all subjects except those with negative HIV exposure sources and hepatitis B Infection.
RESULTS
Study participants and baseline characteristics
A total of 330 subjects were enrolled and stratified into three groups: Group 1 (ABT ? DTG), Group 2 (ABT ? TDF ? 3TC), and Group 3 (DTG ? TDF ? 3TC), with 126, 104, and 100 subjects in each group, respectively. The SS included all 330 participants. The FAS comprised 297 participants, with 99 subjects each per group, after excluding 4 subjects, whose exposure source was confirmed to be negative, and 29 cases, who were confirmed to have hepatitis B infection. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of subjects in the study.
The participants were mostly men (87.2%), their mean age was 31.58  8.82 years, and 92.2% of them were of the Chinese-Han ethnicity. There were no significant differences in mean height or weight between the study groups. With regards to mode of exposure, sexual exposure was calculated to have highest proportion in all three groups (90.9%, 88.8%, and 95.9%, respectively). Vaginal intercourse was the most prevalent mode of sexual exposure, at proportions of 70.7%, 59.6%, and 56.3%, respectively. The overall average exposure time was 26.8  19.5 h. More than half of the study participants in each of the three groups initiated PEP therapy within 24 h of exposure (51.5%, 58.2%, and 58.5%, respectively) (Table 1).

2616

Infect Dis Ther (2021) 10:2611-2623

Fig. 1 Distribution of subjects in the study

The percentage of subjects who completed Day 15 visits in the three groups were 89.9%, 85.9%, and 64.6%, respectively. The percentage of subjects who completed Day 28 visits in the three groups were 55.6%, 52.5%, and 53.5%, respectively. Those who completed Week 12 visits were 55.6%, 57.6%, and 52.5% in the three groups, respectively. Compared to the Day 15 visits, there was a decrease in the proportion of subjects who completed Day 28 and Week 12 visits (Fig. 1). This was due to subjects erroneously believing that they had completed all the required treatment and did not need to present themselves for follow-up on Day 28. As the HIV self-test is widely available in China, subjects preferred to do self-testing for HIV after treatment.

Drug completion
Of the total of 297 participants, 91.9% of Group 1 participants and 85.9% of Group 2 participants completed 2 infusions of ABT. The proportions of subjects who completed 14 days of oral drug prophylaxis in each of the three groups were 91.9%, 85.9%, and 80.8%, respectively. Overall, 64.0% (190/297) of the subjects completed 28 days of oral drug prevention with proportions of 63.6%, 64.6%, and 63.6% in each of the three groups, respectively. There was no significant difference in the rates of oral medication completion over 28 days between the three groups. The 14-day and 28-day completion rate of ABT was significantly higher than the oral drug completion rate (p\0.0001) for all subjects (Table 2).

subjects of Group 1 and 2. For the oral medication, the adherence rates in Group 1 and 2 were slightly higher than in Group 3, but without a statistically significant difference. Group 1 and Group 2 participants exhibited higher adherence to their respective therapeutic regimens compared to Group 3 participants, with a statistically significant difference between Group 1 and 3 (p\0.01) (Table 3).
HIV infection rate
Among the 297 participants, 73.1% (217/297) underwent HIV antibody testing during the period between Day 15 and Week 12 after the administration of the first prophylactic drug, but none of the participants was found to be positive.

Adverse drug reactions
None of the participants reported ADR that would have led to withdrawal from the study. In Group 1 (ABT ? DTG), 26.2% of subjects had 49 ADR of severity grade 1-2, common ADRs being dizziness (7.1%), diarrhea (5.6%), and asthenia (4.8%). In Group 2 (ABT ? TDF ? 3TC), 46 ADRs of severity grade 1-2 were observed in 32.7% of subjects, and common ADRs were dizziness (6.7%), abnormal liver functions (4.8%), asthenia (3.9%), and diarrhea (3.9%). In Group 3 (DTG ? TDF ? 3TC), 26% of subjects had 40 ADRs of severity grade 1-2, with common ADRs being elevated triglycerides (7.0%), dizziness (7.0%), and asthenia (5.0%) (Table 4).

injectable antiretroviral-containing PEP regimens. The results of our study revealed that the 28-day completion rate and the drug adherence rate of ABT were significantly higher than those of the oral drugs, that no subjects tested

seropositive for HIV at the termination of the study, and that co-administration of ABT with oral drugs was found to be safe, effective, and well tolerated.

In our cohort, sexual contact was the predominant mode of exposure, while occupational exposure accounted for only 2.7%. Among those with sexual exposure, vaginal intercourse was the most prevalent sexual method of exposure in our study. This observation differs from that of a prospective study conducted in Paris, in which the primary mode of sexual exposure was anal sex in 65% of patients, while vaginal intercourse accounted for only 26% of cases [12]. However, an observational, cross-sectional study of 678 patients in Spain found vaginal intercourse (99.2%) to be the commonest sexual method of HIV exposure [24].
Our study showed that the 14-day and 28-day completion rates of ABT were significantly higher than the oral drug completion rate for all subjects. The adherence rates to prescribed regimens in Groups 1 and 2 were higher than that in Group 3, with a statistically significant difference. A significant increase in adherence rates to ABT than to oral drugs was noticed in all subjects. Comparing the adherence of all subjects to ABT and oral drugs, we found that the adherence rate to ABT was higher, with a statistically significant difference. This is an expected outcome that replacing 2 NRTIs with an injectable (ABT) may facilitate the PEP drug completion rate. The above findings also suggest that biweekly administration of ABT was well accepted by most of the participants, and could significantly improve drug completion rates. In addition, a significant reduction in the proportion of subjects who completed the oral medication for 14 days was observed in Group 3 as compared to Group 1, indicating that the higher pill burden contributed to the lower completion rate in Group 3.
A similar study conducted in Barcelona, Spain, in which 157 patients had potential sexual exposure to HIV, reported a higher noncompletion rate using LPV/r (47%) versus elvitegravir/cobicistat (33%). Significantly poor adherence to PEP and more adverse events were reported in the LPV/r group versus the elvitegravir/cobicistat group (47% vs. 9%, p = 0.0001 and 90% vs. 49%, p = 0.0001, respectively) [10]. This observation further emphasizes the fact

that using a larger number of individual oral medications for PEP is potentially likely to be responsible for poor drug compliance.
In the present study, the completion rate of all subjects for preventive oral drugs was 64.0%, and drug adherence was observed to be 75.7%, indicating that a large proportion of subjects were unable to consume oral drugs on a regular basis, or discontinued the medication. ABT is a long-acting injectable drug approved for antiretroviral use in China [25]. In our study, ABT was administered on the 1st and 15th days. The low-frequency administration, and compulsory hospital infusion resulted in a 28-day drug completion rate (88.9%) and the adherence rate (94.4%) of ABT was significantly more favorable than that of oral drugs. The combination of ABT with DTG showed the highest completion and adherence rates. This signifies that a simplified two-drug regimen which includes a long-acting injectable drug has the potential to improve drug adherence in participants requiring post-exposure prevention. As ABT requires one biweekly administration due to its extended half-life, poor adherence associated with a three-drug regimen may thus be avoided [26].
It is important to note that, in our study, 55.2% (164/297) participants completed the 12-week follow-up visits. Hence, only 73.1% of participants were subjected to HIV antibody testing between Day 15 and Week 12 after the administration of the first prophylactic drug. This emphasizes the importance of patient education and the effective involvement of the attending doctor in HIV PEP treatment. None of the participants were subsequently found to be infected with HIV.
No serious ADR or injection site reactions that could lead to withdrawal from the study were observed in subjects in our study. The most common ADRs were dizziness, diarrhea, and asthenia of severity grade 1-2. The study drugs were well tolerated. Our results showed that subjects had good overall safety and tolerance to the three regimens.
In the present study, the 28-day completion rate of oral drugs was 64.0% and the HIV antibody detection rate was 60-70%, suggesting that organizing HIV post-exposure prevention

Infect Dis Ther (2021) 10:2611-2623

2621

education and awareness programs, drug adherence supervision, and high-risk drug monitoring may effectively improve compliance and ensure better prevention and management of HIV.
The efficacy and safety of an ABT-containing 2-drug combination (ABT ? LPV/r) have been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials and post marketing studies [20-23]. With the advantages of long-acting, minimal drug-drug interactions, a high barrier to resistance and early blockade of cell fusion mechanism, ABTcontaining 2-drug combinations are being considered as a promising HIV PEP option, especially in regions where STRs are not widely available.
The current study had some limitations. Firstly, there were no objective measurements of plasma drug concentration, which would have been able to determine drug compliance more accurately. Secondly, our cohort had a high proportion of participants not presenting for follow-up visits and the high lost-to-followup rate observed in our study may have negatively impacted on the regimen completion rate and the individual medication compliance rates seen in our study. The reasons for this are complex, and may be related to preservation and maintenance of privacy and confidentiality, and may contribute to the unfortunately low PEP follow-up rate in China. And, thirdly, our study design was not randomized controlled, and selection bias cannot be avoided. Regimen selection was based on participants preference, which introduces bias, and the results may be skewed, especially with regards to patient-reported tolerability.
CONCLUSIONS
ABT-containing regimens (ABT ? DTG or ABT ? TDF ? 3TC) offered a good option for HIV PEP due to higher completion rates and adherence than the DTG ? TDF ? 3TC regimen. The overall safety was comparable and acceptable among the three groups.

CUTANEOUS REACTIONS TO THE POLYSACCHARIDES AND PROTEINS OF PNEUMOCOCCUS IN LOBAR PNEUMONIA
BY WILLIAM S. TILLETT, M.D. ANDTHOMAS FRANCIS, JR., M.D.
(From the Hospital of Tke Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research)
PLATE 32
(Received for publication, July 18, 1929)
Clough, 1915, (1) employing a solution of alcohol precipitable protein derived from pneumococci, tested patients suffering from pneumonia by intradermal injections. There resulted in some instances a slightly elevated discrete papule surrounded by an indefinite zone of hyperemia; all of the reactions faded in 24 hours. Little or no difference was noted between the reactivity of patients with pneumonia and normal individuals, nor was the reaction affected by the stage of the disease in which the test was made. Well, 1916, (2) prepared material from cultures of Type I pneumococcus. He allowed the organisms to autolyze at 37캜. for 2 hours, followed by heating at 60캜. for 1 hour. 0.1 cc. to 0.2 cc. of the supernatant fluid of this solution was used for skin tests. He obtained no reaction in patients tested during the acute phase of the disease. However, 1 to 21 days after crisis, injections produced a circumscribed erythema with slight infiltration at the point of puncture. A few cases did not react at any time; normal persons and patients suffering from other diseases gave no uniform response. In 1917, Steinfeld and Kolmer (3) carried out a series of skin tests, employing heat killed Type I, II, and I I I pneumococci. The reactions were read 48 hours after the injection; when positive the local lesion lasted 4 to 5 days. Six of 19 pneumonia patients gave positive reactions with one or another of the test organisms. No relation was noted between the type of pneumococcus eliciting the skin response and the causative organism of the disease. All of the positive reactions were obtained in patients tested after the crisis. _ Tests on control individuals were recorded as being negative. Weiss and Kolmer, 1918, (4) employed in a study of the cutaneous reaction of pneumonia patients, so-called pneumotoxin prepared by dissolving washed pneumococci in 2 per cent sodium choleate. This material was freshly made and standardized in terms of minimal lethal doses for guinea pigs. The reactions were read 48 hours after the injection. In adults positive reactions'were obtained in 100 per cent of 31 acute cases. The period of reactivity ranged from the fifth day (2 days before crisis) to the thirteenth day (6 days after crisis) of disease. In children, tests were positive during the acute phase of illness and negative after recovery. No correlation was noted between a

positive test and the type of pneumococcus derived from the sputum. Bigelow, 1922, (5) prepared several varieties of test materials; they consisted of heat killed pneumococci, autolysates, and solutions. In some instances the material was derived from pooled cultures of Types I, II, III, and Group IV pneumococci; other preparations were prepared from organisms of a single type. In tests on 104 patients, he described two types of reaction. One of these was designated as type specific. It was described as an indurated papule surrounded by an areola, which reached its height 28 to 32 hours after inoculation. This form of response was best obtained with autolysates. It was considered by the author to be type specific since in 8 of 11 cases the material eliciting a positive reaction corresponded in type to that of the pneumococcus recovered from the patient. In 3 patients this correlation did not occur. The second or "common" reaction was obtained with most of the preparations. Lesions of this character reached their height in 18 hours and faded in 24 to 36 hours. It was obtained in 42.3 per cent of those tested and, in most instances, was elicited after crisis had taken place. Fortyfive per cent of control individuals also gave this reaction. The author concludes that positive tests occur most commonly at the time during which antibodies would be present in greatest concentration. Herrold and Traut, 1927, (6) employed filtrates derived from a 5 day culture of an avirulent Type I pneumococeus. Reactions, when positive, appeared in about 12 hours and reached the maximum after 18 hours. Readings were made at the end of 24 hours. Of 38 patients acutely ill with pneumonia, 73 per cent failed to react, while only 15 per cent of normal persons, gave negative tests. Eight patients were repeatedly tested; one of these, negative at first, later became positive; another, originally positive, subsequently became negative; 2 were positive and 4 negative throughout the period of observation. They state that they found no relation between the material used for positive tests and the type of pneumococcus causing the infection.
From this review of the literature it will be seen that uniform results
have not been obtained in pneumonia patients tested intracutaneously
with pneumococcus products. It will be further noted that, with the
exception of Clough (1) who used pneumococcus protein, the tests
have been made with autolysates, heat killed organisms, solutions of
pneumococci, and culture filtrates. Materials of this character are
known to contain a variety of bacterial products, such as protein, carbohydrate, pneumotoxin, hemolysin, and the purpura producing
substance, as well as other derivatives of enzyme action, in varying concentrations. Attention is directed to this point since the results
reported in this paper demonstrate that the composition of the material used for injection influences the character of the reaction.

were separately employed for intradermal injection into patients acutely ill with and convalescent from lobar pneumonia. The material used for testing consisted of: 1. The purified, protein-free, carbohydrates of Types I, II, and III pneumococci,--the so-called soluble specific substances; 2. The somatic proteins of Pneumococcus. This material, the acetic acid precipitable fraction, consists largely of nudeo-protein. A description of both carbohydrate and protein is given further on. It has been shown by Avery and Heidelberger (7) that the pneumococcus carbohydrates are the type specific components; they react only in homologous type specific anti-sere, and, in purified form, are not antigenic. The protein fraction, on the other hand, is a common constituent of the pneumococcus species; antibodies elicited by immunization with it, react with protein derived from any strain of this organism.
In addition to the intradermal injection of the polysaccharides and protein, the experiments were supplemented by obtaining serum from the patients just prior to the skin test, and titrating for the presence or absence of antibodies reactive with the test solutions.

Material and Methods
Skin Testing Materials. 1. Soluble Specific Subslances.--Type specific polys&ccharides from each of three pneumococcus Types (I, II, and IH) were employed. They were obtained in purified state according to the method employed in this laboratory by Heidelberger and Avery (8). As demonstrated by Heidelberger, Goebel, and Avery (9), these substances possess the chemical properties of complex sugars; they contain no phosphorous, no sulfur, and give none of the usual protein color tests. Type II and Type H I substances are nitrogen-free. The Type I substance differs from the other two in containing nitrogen as an apparently essential component. The total nitrogen present in Type I is 5 per cent, half of which is present in the 8vn|no form. Despite the presence of nitrogen, the substance fails to give any of the protein color reactions. For skin tests, the polysaccharides were dissolved in freshly prepared physiological salt solution in such concentration that 0.t cc. of solution contained 0.0i mgm. of specific polysaccharide. For purposes of sterility the solutions were heated at 100캜. for 10 minutes before being used.
2. PneumococcusProtein.--The material was prepared according to the method described by Avery and Morgan (10). Cultures of an R strain of pneumococcus originally derived from Type H S organisms served as the source from which the protein was obtained. The preparations were filtered through Berkefeld filters and tested for sterility before being used for injection. The material was stand-

690

CUTANEOUS REACTIONS IN LOBAR PNEUMONIA

ardized by nitrogen determinations and diluted in fresh physiological salt solution so that 0.1 cc. of solution contained 0.01 mgm. of protein.
In each instance the material was injected in 0.1 cc. amounts into the skin on the flexor surface of the forearm.
Titration of Sera for Antibodies.--Blood, obtained from patients by venapunc-
ture, was allowed to dot, centrifuged, and the clear serum pipetted off. Tests for precipitins reactive with carbohydrate and protein were separately carried out. 0.2 cc. serum diluted with 0.3 cc. physiological salt solution was mixed with 0.5 cc. of varying dilutions of the precipitinogens. Readings were made after the tubes had been allowed to incubate at 37캜. for 2 hours and then placed in the icebox over night. It was found that type specific antibodies were more easily demonstrable by agglutination tests with the intact type specific cells. Consequently this test was more commonly used. 0.5 cc. of varying dilutions of serum was mixed with 0.5 cc. of heat killed organisms of each of Types I, I I and III. The tubes were incubated at 37캜. for 2 hours and kept on ice over night. A positive reaction was detected by the presence of the characteristic disc formation.
On admission to the hospital patients were injected intradermally with Types I, I I and I I I carbohydrate solutions, protein solution, and a control injection of fresh physiological salt solution. The tests were often repeated several times both during the acute phase of the illness and after crisis. Freshly prepared materials were always employed for injection. This precaution was considered to be of considerable importance since it was found that solutions which had been standing for several days often gave rise to immediate reactions which were deceptive. In addition to skin tests, serum obtained, in most instances at the time of intradermal injection, was titred for antibodies reactive with the carbohydrates and protein. Typing of the pneumococcus derived from the sputum of the tested patients was also carried out.

Cutaneous Reactions to Specific Polysaccharides
Observation on the skin reaction of nineteen individuals suffering from lobar pneumonia have been made following injection of 0.01 mgm. of each of the type specific polysaccharides. Classified on the basis of the pneumococcus type derived from the patient, the cases m a y be divided into: 11 cases of T y p e I infection; 3 of T y p e I I ; 2 of Atypical Type II; and 3 of Group IV. Unfortunately, no instances of Type III pneumococcus infection were available during the period of this investigation.*
* While this communication was in press a patient, convalescent from Type I I I pneumococcus pneumonia, has shown a positive reaction with the Type I I I polysaccharide. The patient's serum contained type-specific antibodies at the time of the positive test.

wxL~z_~ s. TIT.L~.TTAND ~OM-aS Yl~ANC~S,JR.

691

In the 11 cases of Type I infection, 10 reacted to Type I S carbohydrate and none to the Type II or III substances. Of the 3 Type II cases one reacted to Type II polysaccharide, whereas all three were negative to the sugars derived from Types I and III. The 2 atypical Type II and the 3 Group IV cases were entirely negative.
With regard to the time of appearance of a positive reaction, none of the cases before recovery reacted positively. Of the 11 cases in which a positive test was obtained, 10 reacted at the time of recovery. One patient, suffering from Type I pneumococcus pneumonia did not give a positive skin test until the twenty-sixth day after recovery from the acute phase of the illness. He had persistent fever, and evidence of pleurisy during this time and only after these signs of persistent infection began to subside did the skin test become positive.
A positive reaction, when obtained, was very striking and may be described as follows:
Ten to twenty minutes after the intradermal inoculation, there appears at the site of injection a wheal-like swellingwith intense white edema. Surrounding the wheal, a zone of erythema appears which becomes increasingly larger and more intense. The edges are irregular due to the "pseudopods" of erythema extending in different directions. The height of the reaction occurs between 30 and 60 minutes after the inoculation. (SeeFigs. 1 and 2.) Within another hour the acute phase has entirely faded; a gradual regression then takes place leaving a firm, pale, edematous area which may require 24 hours or longer to disappear completely. Reactions of this character have been found to be strictly type specific and to occur only with the polysaccharide corresponding to the serological type of the infecting organism. At the site of injection of the carbohydrates of heterologous types and of the salt solution, no reaction appeared. The "wheal and erythema" form of reaction, just described, differs strikingly from the delayed response elicited by the bacterial protein.
In testing the sera of patients, it was found that in all instances in which a positive skin reaction was elicited with the specific carbohydrates, agglutinins for the homologous type of pneumococcus and precipitins for the reacting polysaccharide were present. Furthermore, the time at which specific antibodies were demonstrable in the circulation has been coincident with the development of a positive skin reaction. However, the fact that individuals may possess circulating specific antibodies without responding to the intradermal injection of the homologous specific substance will be subsequently shown.
Ten of the 11 cases in which a definite skin response to the homolo-

692

CUTANEOUS REACTIONS IN LOBAR PNEUMONIA

gous specific polysaccharide was obtained, suffered from Type I pneumococcus infection. Eight of these cases were treated with Type I antipneumococcus horse serum in 100 cc. doses at six hour intervals until recovery. Regardless of the amount of serum administered the skin reaction did not become positive until the patient had clinically recovered. The investigations are not as yet sufficiently extensive to determine the exact relations between specific antibodies introduced therapeutically and the occurrence of a positive skin reaction. However, the results are suggestive that the production of a local response with the specific polysaccharide may, under certain conditions, be helpful in determining when sufficient serum treatment has been given. Studies are being continued in an attempt to determine this
point. The single instance of Type I infection, which failed to react to the
Type I carbohydrate occurred in a patient who developed pneumococcus meningitis and died on the twentieth day of disease. This patient, after receiving 800 cc. of serum, possessed demonstrable circulating Type I antibodies, but gave only doubtful or negative skin test. Another individual, after recovering from the acute phase of the illness, continued to run a low grade fever and showed signs of pleurisy. He reacted positively to the Type I specific substance only after beginning cessation of infection. These two cases suggest that persistence of infection, even though specific antibodies are present, may inhibit the skin response.
In two patients suffering from Type I pneumococcus pneumonia, no serum was administered. In both instances a positive skin response was obtained after recovery, indicating that a positive test is not dependent upon the presence of therapeutic serum. Of three Type II cases included in this series one gave a typical positive reaction to the Type II specific polysaccharide.. The reaction first appeared as the result of a test made the day after, crisis; the patient's serum at this time contained Type II agglutinins and precipitins. The other two Type II patients failed to react even to 0.1 mgm. of specific substance. These failures occurred despite the fact that the blood serum, in each cage, contained specific Type II antibodies and that all evidence of infection had completely subsided. As formerly noted the two atypical Type II and 3 Group IV cases of pneumococcus in-

WILLIAM S. TILLETT AND THOMAS ~RANCIS~ JR.

fection gave no response at any time to the skin tests with the polysaccharides of Types I, II, or III.
In all patients, tests were repeated every few days during convalescence. Those patients in whom the reactions were positive on several occasions and subsequently became negative, ceased to react at the time of disappearance of specific antibodies from the circulation.
In Table I a protocol of five cases is given, which serves to show the time of appearance and duration of skin sensitivity in relation to both recovery of patient and occurrence of demonstrable specific antibodies in the circulation.
Cases Ka. and La. suffered from Type I pneumococcus infection and were treated with Type I antipneumococcus horse serum. Case Ka. is interesting in that skin sensitivity to Type I carbohydrate and circulating Type I antibodies have persisted for 127 days after recovery; observations on this patient are being continued. CaseLa. first reacted on the day after recovery; three days later his capacity to react had ceased coincident with the disappearance of specificagglutinins and precipifius. Patient Ca., the caseof pneumococcusmeningitis referred to above failed to give a definite positive reaction at any time. CasesSt. and Mo. were instances of spontaneous recovery from Type I and Type II pneumococcus infections, respectively. They each gave typical responses after crisis and continued to do so, as long as demonstrable circulating antibodies were present. In the other patients, who gave a positive skin test, the same relations were found to hold as those presented in Table I.
The local reaction resulting from the intradermal injection of 0.01 mgm. of the type specific polysaccharides presented three distinctive characteristics; first, the carbohydrate eliciting a response was always homologous in type to that of the infecting organism; second, both the gross appearance of the lesion and the rapidity with which it developed and retrogressed were characteristic of the typical wheal and erythema type of reaction; third, the capacity to react, when evident, developed at the time of the patient's recovery, and was, in this group of cases, correlated with the presence of homologous type specific agglutinins and precipitins.

obtained with the carbohydrates. Of twelve patients tested while acutely ill, all failed to react. In eight individuals repeated injections were made both before and after recovery. Seven of them gave positive tests after crisis, and also with each repetition of the test during convalescence. These patients have not been retested since discharge from the hospital.
A test, when positive, developed slowly as compared with the reaction elicited by the carbohydrates. In 6 to 8 hours there appeared a small, dark red, circumscribed lesion, about 0.5 cm. in diameter. It gradually increased in size until a maximum was reached in 18 to 24 hours. Readings were recorded at this time. (See Fig. 3.) Regression which began after 36 to 48 hours, usually proceded slowly, and 3 to 4 days often were required for complete disappearance. When at its height, the lesion varied from 1 to 5 cm. in diameter; it consisted of a small central papule, dark red in color, surrounded by a bright pink erythema; the edges faded gradually into normal skin; slight tenderness was some times present and the local temperature often seemed to be increased. The protein reactions were similar in many respects to the tuberculin response. That this type of reaction, in contrast to the response induced by polysaccharides, was unrelated to the type of pneumococcus causing infection is borne out by the fact that of the 7 patients, in whom positive tests were obtained, 2 had Type I pneumonia, 2 Type II, 2 Atypical Type II, and 1 Group IV.
In determining the presence of pneumococcus protein precipitins, it was found that the sera of all the patients possessed antibodies reactive with this test material. The titre ranged from 1:2,000 to 1:16,000 in the different cases. However, in a single individual, variations in amount of precipitins occurring coincident with the progress of the disease were not sufficiently striking nor constant to be considered of significance. In Table II, the results of the protein skin tests are given for those cases in which repeated injections were made.
Table II" shows the relation of the development of skin sensitivity both to the time of recovery from infection and to the titre of antiprotein antibodies with serum. From the data it appears that the protein sensitiveness develops after crisis, but, as contrasted with the

WILLIA~ S. TILLETT AND THOMAS ~FRANCIS, JR.

699

reaction to the carbohydrate, is unrelated to the quantity of precipitins present in the circulation.
The presence of antibodies to pneumococcusprotein in the serum of human beings, has not, as a search of the literature reveals, been the subject of previous investigation. The possible significance of their occurrence is a part of this, as yet uncompleted, study. In addition to the cases cited above, the sera of 13 other pneumonia patients have been tested at frequent intervals after admission to the hospital until discharge. They were all found to possess in their serum protein precipitins in concentrations comparable to those recorded in Table II. The study of the anti-protein antibodies is being continued and a more complete report will be made in a later communication.

DISCUSSION
Although the observations reported in this paper on a relatively small number of patients represent an investigation which is, as yet, incomplete, sufficiently definite results have been obtained to warrant presentation. It has been shown that pneumococcus polysaccharides, when injected intradermally into pneumonia patients after crisis, can bring about in some instances, a local reaction. The cutaneous response, when obtained, was always elicited by the carbohydrate homologous to the type of pneumococcus causing infection in the patient. A patient's capacity to react became manifest coincident with recovery from infection. Furthermore, skin sensitivity has been found to parallel closely the presence of circulating type specific antibodies. The two phenomena have been found to appear at about the same time, to persist for a similar period, and to disappear at about the Same stage of convalescence. However, the mere presence of type specific antibodies in the circulation is not the only factor necessary for the excitation of a skin response. The fatal case complicated by pneumococcus meningitis possessed type specific agglutinins in high titre but at no time could a definite,skin response be obtained. Further investigation on a larger number of cases is necessary before the underlying mechanism can be fully interpreted. However, undetermined as the problem at the present may be, it is an
interesting fact that these bacterial sugars, protein-free, alad belonging

700

CUTANEOUS REACTIONS IN LOBAR PNEUMONIA

to that group of immunologically specific substances known as haptens, are capable of producing a reaction in the skin of convalescents from pneumococcus pneumonia. The character of the skin response incited by the polysaccharides is unique in that it is urticarial-like in appearance and runs its course in 1 to 2 hours.
The reaction caused by pneumococcusprotein, on the other hand, is similar both in appearance and evolution to that evoked by tuberculin. The protein reactions, when positive, reached the maximum intensity about 24 hours after injection and some times required 3 to 4 days to subside completely. Furthermore, a patient's capacity to react to protein has no relation to the type of pneumococcus causing the infection. Sufficient observations on the presence and quantitative variations of anti-protein antibodies have not yet been made to justify final conclusions. In the instances reported in this paper, antiprotein precipitins were found in all cases both before and after crisis. In any single individual the titre did not markedly vary during the course of disease, nor did it appear to influence skin sensitivity.
The data presented in this paper represents observations made in the course of lobar pneumonia. Similar tests on normal individuals and patients suffering from other diseases are being carried out and the results will be reported in a subsequent paper.
CONCLUSIONS
I. a. Pneumococcus polysaccharides, when injected intradermally into patients convalescent from pneumonia, are capable of eliciting a response. The polysaccharide inducing a cutaneous reaction was found always to be homologous in type to that of the pneumococcus causing the infection.
b. The character of the reaction incited by the protein-free bacterial sugars is of the immediate wheal and erythema type.
c. A patient's capacity to react was found to be intimately associated both with recovery from infection and with the presence of type specific antibodies in the circulating blood.
II. a. The so-called nucleo-protein of pneumococcus, when injected intradermally, also causes a local cutaneous reaction in patients during convalescence from lobar pneumonia.

WILLIAM S. TILLETT AND THOMAS ]~RANCIS~ JR.

b. The local lesion resulting from the injection of protein is tuberculin-like in character, and differs from that evoked by the type-specific polysaccharides in gross appearance, time of development, and duration.
c. Individuals, acutely ill with and convalescent from pneumococcus pneumonia, possess in their circulating blood, precipitins reactive with pneumococcus protein. In the observations recorded, the concentration of anti-protein antibodies in the blood serum did not seem to influence the patient's capacity to react to intradermal injection of the protein.

Abstract The aim of this study was to address the problems associated with polypharmacy in elderly cancer patients and to highlight the role of pharmacists in such cases in re- source-limited settings. A narrative review of existing literature was performed to summarize the evidence regarding the impact of polypharmacy in elderly cancer pa- tients and the pharmaceutical strategies to manage it. This review emphasizes the significance of polypharmacy, which is often ignored in real clinical practice. Polypharmacy in the elderly cancer population is mainly due to: chemotherapy with one or more neoplastic agents for cancer treatment, treatment for adverse drug re- actions due to neoplastic agents, the patient's comorbid conditions, or drug interac- tions. The role of the clinical pharmacist in specialized oncology hospitals or oncology departments of tertiary care hospitals is well established; however, this is not the case in many developing countries. A clinical pharmacist can contribute to solving the problems associated with polypharmacy by identifying the risks associated with polypharmacy and its management in resource-limited settings. As in many devel- oped countries, the involvement of a clinical pharmacist in cancer care for elderly patients may play a vital role in the recognition and management of polypharmacy- related problems. Further research can be conducted to support this role.

1|INTRODUCTION
Aging is associated with multiple--often chronic--illnesses, with an in- creased risk of the prescription of multiple medicines. The use of nu- merous medications--generally described as polypharmacy--can lead to unfortunate conditions and some medications are known to interact with each other.1,2 Elderly patients are more likely to experience poly- pharmacy compared to other age groups, as they tend to suffer from more therapeutic conditions requiring pharmacotherapy. Polypharmacy in elderly individuals poses a significant risk to well-being; however, it

is difficult to avoid.3-5 With this background, we aimed to summarize the existing evidence regarding the impact of polypharmacy in elderly cancer patients. We also aimed to provide some strategies for clinical pharmacists to contribute to the management of such problems.

SHRESTHA et al.
polypharmacy can be characterized from multiple points of view. As indicated by Hajjar et al,6 polypharmacy is characterized as "the use of multiple medications and/or the administration of more medica- tions than are clinically indicated, representing unnecessary drug use." Polypharmacy comprises of the number of medications taken by the patient, the existence of one or more wrong medications in a prescription, or an amalgamation of both, which can increase the risk for adverse drug events (ADEs), underutilization of medication, and repetition of medicine.6 Polypharmacy can be defined as "the use of multiple drugs or more than are medically necessary, [and it] is a de- veloping concern for senior adults."7 Because of its relationship with antagonistic medication responses and falls, the term polypharmacy has negative connotations with a range of adverse events among the officially powerless geriatric populace.8
Polypharmacy can be a mild to severe issue for patients of any age group, but particularly for elderly patients. For instance, due to the existence of various comorbidities in elderly cancer patients, drug therapies might be combined; furthermore, the expanded ac- cessibility of over-the-counter, herbal, and complementary/alterna- tive medicines (which patients often fail to declare to their specialist, doctor, or pharmacist) can contribute to polypharmacy. These pop- ulations remain at high risk for ADEs linked with polypharmacy and drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Elderly patients undergo many phys- iologic changes that may modify the different pharmacokinetics pa- rameters, such as absorption, first-pass metabolism, protein binding, distribution, metabolism, and eliminations of the drugs. Molecular and cellular fluctuations may modify the pharmacodynamics of me- tabolism of the drug variations and may alter the effect of a drug on its target site and the narrow therapeutic windows related with che- motherapeutic agents due to the drugs that are given.9,10 Together with the alterations in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic vari- ables, the risk in elderly patients is increased due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs).
3|POLYPHARMAC Y IN ELDERLY C ANCER PAT I E N T S
Among elderly cancer patients, polypharmacy has a noteworthy consequence and its incidence is increasing. Nevertheless, its pre- dominance and impacts in disease patients are not well defined, particularly in end-of-life scenes.11 Globally, numerous elderly can- cer patients, many with comorbidities, are being treated with at least one or more drugs in oncology hospitals or clinics. In the man- agement of most cancers, chemotherapy in combination with other treatments is more common than single chemotherapy agents. The inception of chemotherapy with at least one cytotoxic or targeted agent as well as drugs for the management of growth manifesta- tions or the harmful impacts identified with treatment can result in polypharmacy.12
Prescribing the drug or chemotherapeutic agents is one of the foremost challenges in treating elderly cancer patients; fur- thermore, it is not simple. Cancers patients are at great risk of

  | 43
medication-connected events as they are usually prescribed an extensive number of medicines, both for the disease itself and for supportive care.13
The treatment of cancer involves multiple medications and in- cludes the unfavorable impacts/reactions of the cytotoxic treat- ments.14 Usage of multiple medicines is an important factor for treating the health conditions of elderly people; however, compli- cations can arise from antineoplastic therapy, which might influence the consequences of cancer treatment.1
The practice of many medicines can prompt additional drugs to the medication regimen, as different medications are prescribed to respond to the problems of former medicines, which is especially valid in the case of cytotoxic chemotherapy for the management of malignancy. There are numerous ADRs, ranging from mild nausea to myelosuppression, because of anticancer agents, which may prompt polypharmacy.14
3.1|Prevalence of polypharmacy in elderly cancer patients
The reported prevalence of polypharmacy in the elderly population varies substantially, ranging from 10% to 96%.15 Due to changes in the pharmacokinetic profile associated with aging, elderly patients have varied pharmacodynamic responses to medications. The comorbid condition due to aging leads to a higher prevalence of polypharmacy in the elderly population than that in younger patients.16 Therefore this group is more likely to suffer from ADEs or decreased therapeu- tic/beneficial effects of the medications. Elderly cancer patients are often exposed to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and these chem- otherapeutic agents may lead to acute or long-term toxicity, which might require other supportive medications. This might result in drug interactions and increased drug burden.17 Balducci et al1 examined numerous studies in elderly cancer patients that showed age as a risk factor for polypharmacy, which may interrupt the consequence of the cancer treatment. Similarly, Jrgensen et al18 reported that 35% of el- derly patients diagnosed with breast, lung, colon, rectal, prostate, or ovarian cancer were each taking more than five drugs between 1996 and 2006. They found that the prevalence of polypharmacy increased with age (39% of 80-90-year-old patients and 41% of 90-91-year-old patients). Polypharmacy was more common among older cancer pa- tients compared to younger cancer patients and those in the same age group without cancer. Surprisingly, it was also found that an increase in several prescribed drugs was initiated before 6 months of manifes- tations of malignant growth, demonstrating the increase in trend of prescription drugs during such period.
A study conducted in ambulatory cancer patients in Canada sug- gested that in newly diagnosed cancer patients aged 60 years and above, polypharmacy was assessed as taking an average of five med- ications at the time of diagnosis.13 A Scottish study assessed com- munity-dispensed prescription and adverse event data from 1995 to 2010 and revealed that the number of dispensed medications was a significant forecaster for potentially serious DDIs.19 Nobili et al20 also supported previous findings and concluded that the elderly

44 | 
population constitutes the largest group of people highly susceptible to developing DDIs.
Besides the aforementioned studies, there is other evidence that supports the higher prevalence of polypharmacy in the elderly popu- lation. For example, a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted by Goh et al17 evaluated the types and incidence of drug-related prob- lems among elderly cancer patients and showed the non-adherence, underprescribing, and ADEs. Drug-related problems were identified in 77.6% of elderly cancer patients (approximately one incidence of three drug-related problems per patient). Polypharmacy leading to drug-related problems is prevalent in elderly cancer patients receiving outpatient intravenous chemotherapy.17 Prithviraj et al21 conducted a cross-sectional study showing a high prevalence of polypharmacy and inappropriate medication in newly diagnosed elderly cancer patients. Another prospective and observational study--by Flood et al22 showed that polypharmacy was common in elderly cancer patients during hos- pitalization in an oncology-acute care unit for the elderly.
Thus, elderly cancer patients have a higher risk of polypharmacy than patients of the same age without cancer.
3.2|Polypharmacy and association with outcomes in geriatric oncology
Polypharmacy is associated with a major problem: the risk of hos- pitalization and death among elderly patients with or without can- cer.23-27 The review study conducted in 2016 associated multiple risks factors for adverse outcomes in geriatric oncology as a result of polypharmacy.15 In an oncology setting, polypharmacy with in- appropriate medications may contribute to: the patient's worsened condition, frailty syndrome, poor physical function, poor survival, and a higher number of comorbidities.28-30 Some studies have aimed to associate polypharmacy and its outcomes in geriatric oncology; for example, in 2014, Kim et al31 considered a group of patients aged 65 years and over who underwent a comprehensive geriatric assess- ment (CGA) before palliative first-line chemotherapy (various cancer sites were involved). Out of 98 patients, 40% of patients met the criteria for polypharmacy. The result was observed to have no con- nection with early termination of palliative chemotherapy.
The current evidence advocates that with an increase in the number of medications used in geriatric cancer patients, there is a high risk of chemotherapy-induced toxicity and adverse physiologi- cal functions. Some of the prominent ADRs associated with chemo- therapies are defective blood counts, immunosuppression, nausea, vomiting, hair loss, renal toxicity, and hepatotoxicity. Lastly, the in- tervention and screening of polypharmacy in regular clinical practice may require precise studies to scrutinize the impact of polyphar- macy and its outcomes in geriatric cancer patients.15
3.3|Interventions for polypharmacy in geriatric assessment studies
To some extent, polypharmacy has been aligned with evalua- tion studies in geriatric oncology settings. However, there is no

SHRESTHA et al.
assessment of polypharmacy as a factor to predispose adverse re- actions; furthermore, interventions for polypharmacy are uncertain. There is an urgent need for consistent interventions to manage poly- pharmacy in geriatric oncology practice.15
In a prospective study of elderly cancer patients aged 70 years or more, geriatricians proposed a change in prescribed medications (mostly in switching chemotherapy to supportive care) in more than 20% of patients based on CGA results; however, the proposed medi- cation intervention and its benefits were not reported.32
In contrast, a prospective cohort study conducted by Kalsi et al33 showed an association between geriatrician-led CGA interventions and improved chemotherapy tolerance in geriatric patients aged 70 or more during chemotherapy. The intervention was applied to unnecessary medications, such as adjustment of antihypertensive medications in over- or undertreated patients wherein 19% of un- dertreated patients benefited.
Aparicio et al34 conducted a pilot study to assess the viability of mini geriatric assessment (MGA) done by a gastroenterologist, which showed the adaptation of non-oncological therapy and social care due to MGA in 72% and 38% of patients, respectively. Yet, there was no difference in strategy, which suggested that MGA could help gastroenterologists for adaptation of treatment of cancer.
An intervention study was done by Sokol et al10 in which oncol- ogists were required to change their prescriptions based on possible drug interactions; however, the physicians did not edit prescrip- tions unrelated to potential drug interactions. The study concluded that physicians should consider possible outcomes in association with polypharmacy and chronic use data. Incentives should be pro- vided to physicians for optimization of safe and effective oncologic therapeutics.
A 2012 interventional study by Horgan et al35 assessing CGA provides recommendations on modification of medication for geri- atric oncology patients aged above 70 years. This intervention led to the identification of previously unidentified medical problems in 70% of patients.
Corcoran et al36 suggested reducing the risks associated with polypharmacy by: educating patients and physicians, drug monitor- ing, and intervention. Additionally, investigations into the pharmaco- kinetic parameters of chemotherapeutic agents provide information on: possible drug interactions and adverse outcomes, how to decide on toxicity levels, and how to prevent the pharmacological responses of drug interactions.
Finally, an intervention study involving a multidisciplinary team, including clinical pharmacists, enrolled high-risk geriatric patients with polypharmacy and showed an effective reduction of unneces- sary medications resulting in improved patient health outcomes.7
4|RISKS AND PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH POLYPHARMAC Y
There are various unfavorable results related to polypharmacy, which is regrettable as it is often unavoidable. These include ADRs,

SHRESTHA et al.
drug interactions, prolonged hospitalization or increased hospital stay, and an increase in the cost of health care.
4.1|Adverse drug reactions
The burden of polypharmacy increases the greater cost of health care. It is also connected to elevated risk of ADEs in elderly patients due to: the greater possibility of DDIs, medication adherence, the vulner- ability of the elderly populace to side-effects of medications, and physical changes identified with aging that trigger difficulties in taking medicines as proposed.37,38 Runciman et al39 affirmed that ADEs are accountable for more than 30% of unexpected hospital admissions in people aged 75 years and above in Australian health care settings.
4.2|Drug interactions
The frequency of drug interactions in elderly patients is not well docu- mented. Senior patients are at greatest risk of having drug-related in- teractions and various kinds of drug interactions can happen, including drug-drug, drug-disease, drug-food, drug-alcohol, drug-herbal-prod- ucts, and drug-nutritional-status interaction. The variables, including age-related physiologic alterations in pharmacokinetics and pharma- codyanmics, infirmity, inter-individual variability, decreased homoeo- static mechanisms of the human body, and psychosocial concerns (which are almost universal among patients who have progressive life- threatening diseases), should be considered when drug interactions are evaluated.40 One of the most important challenges in elderly patients with cancer is a drug interaction that is inescapable.41
Polypharmacy and drug interactions have been recognized as the most hazardous factors for ADR, which is one of the most common outcomes.42 This may be the reason for multiple visits to the emer- gency department.43 The threat of polypharmacy plus DDI is greater in elderly individuals, who regularly experience the ill effects of a variety of therapeutic conditions and are thus prescribed multiple medications, several of which are connected with each other to de- liver undesirable impacts. Ruiter et al44 found that ADRs and DDIs increased the risk of hospitalization by fourfold in patients aged 75 or more, compared to those aged 55 to 74 years. Alkan et al45 found that out of 445 elderly cancer patients, nearly one-third were exposed to potentially inappropriate medications and drug interac- tions that were very severe. In this study, the investigators found that polypharmacy (with more than five drugs), inpatient status, and diagnosis of lung cancer were connected with severe drug interac- tions. This study, which was carried out in Turkey, suggests that cli- nicians should be more restrained when prescribing and preparing drugs for elderly patients. Girre et al41 conducted a study in France among 105 patients and found that almost half of the interactions were moderate.
4.3|Increased health care cost
Another possible issue that accompanies polypharmacy is increased health care cost, which may be direct or indirect. An association

  | 45
among polypharmacy, DDIs, ADRs, and repeated hospital admission has been demonstrated by researchers.46-48 ADEs increase health care costs by increasing hospital admissions, or as a result of unpre- dicted drug interaction,14,49 along with increased visits to the emer- gency department and clinics.50
Polypharmacy is associated with increased cost,1 increasing medical expenses for the patient and the health care institution. Increased health care costs include the price of unsuitable or iden- tical medications, additional medicines for treating newly induced symptoms, laboratory costs, and supplementary patient monitoring that may be obligatory.12
In a Swedish study, Hovstadius et al51 describe increases in pre- scription medication spending of 6.2% and 7.3% for patients taking five or more and 10 or more medications, respectively. Shrestha et al14 also discuss the financial burden of patients due to ADRs and chemotherapy where more ADRs were seen in patients aged more than 60 years. In a retrospective cohort study, Akazawa et al52 showed an association among polypharmacy, increased risk of taking possibly unsuitable medicines, and increased hospital admissions, leading to increments in medical costs of approximately 30%.52
5|MANAG EMENT OF POLYPHARMAC Y BY CLINIC AL PHARMACIS TS IN ELDERLY CANCER PATIENTS
Polypharmacy is a problem that requires a rational and organized method. Incorporating clinical pharmacy services into the multidiscipli- nary oncology team can play a crucial role in the identification of risks accompanying polypharmacy and management of polypharmacy.53 There are various strategies for managing polypharmacy in elderly can- cer patients, which can also be applicable to other chronic diseases.
5.1|Taking an appropriate medication history
Evaluating the relevance of a patient's present drug therapy and guidance to forthcoming treatment selections can be obtained from an appropriate medication history. This can be obtained by close teamwork among health professionals (i.e., patients, doctors, nurses, and clinical pharmacists), in cooperation with patients. Existing procedures intended for documenting drug histories have been identified as insufficient, needing improvement, and in some cases actually hazardous.54 Health professionals should consolidate their medical records and keep them up to date. A thorough medication history includes an interview with questions about: the currently prescribed drugs; doses; routes of administration; frequencies; treatment duration; other medications (e.g., over-the-counter, herbal remedies, complementary/alternative medicines); assessment of drug containers or lists, or both; and communication with commu- nity pharmacies or specific doctors. Additionally, other information on the history from previous medical reports can be obtained, such as earlier prescriptions, previous drug interactions, the aforemen- tioned ADRs, and previous hypersensitivity reactions.55 One of the

46 | 
most important responsibilities of clinical pharmacists is to obtain accurate medication histories with the above-described methods to confirm that the patient's present and forthcoming therapy is harm- less and effective.
5.2|Medication reconciliation and medication review
According to St Peter,56 individual procedures are required to avoid and resolve medication-related complications and subsequently to reduce polypharmacy. These include parameters such as medica- tion reconciliation, medication review, and ongoing patient-centered medication therapy management.56 A multidisciplinary approach involving clinical pharmacists in the medical oncology group can ef- fectively manage polypharmacy in elderly cancer patients.
Medication reconciliation and medication review are both im- perative tools for pharmaceutical care. The two terms are different and require definition. Medication reconciliation is the straightfor- ward management of drugs,57 that is, the method of building a list of correct medications.58 Medication reconciliation is preliminary to medication review.
A critical involvement for addressing polypharmacy is a sys- tematic and detailed medication review to evaluate whether the patient has obtained therapeutic advantage from their medication, whether there are continuing medical needs, and whether risks and side-effects are balanced by probable pros.59 The patient's medica- tion regimen should be assessed for safety and correctness from the perspective of the specific patient's multiple morbid illnesses, health literacy, and issues of sociodemographics. Advanced clinical drug therapy expertise is necessary for medication review and it is well recognized that pharmacists own these clinical skill sets.60
Medication reconciliation and medication review will potentially involve the prescription and deprescription of drugs. Similar decent practices and standards ought to be connected when medical treat- ment is started and when it is discontinued.61 In the global scenario of the health care system, deprescribing is an impartially innovative theory, which is the way toward decreasing or halting medications, aimed at minimizing multiple uses of drugs and improving health out- comes for patients.
5.3|Multidisciplinary approach
In most cases, polypharmacy can be managed with a multidiscipli- nary approach. The study by Holland conducted at an Irish teach- ing hospital demonstrates how interdisciplinary teamwork between the clinical pharmacist and doctor can develop the comprehensive- ness and accurateness of discharge medicines through the estab- lishment of a discharge medication reconciliation service, which is commanded by the pharmacist.57 Shrestha et al53 also stated that the clinical pharmacist can act as a bridge between the medical on- cologist and the patient in an oncology setting by providing clinical pharmacy services. These services, such as discharge medication reconciliation, can be best provided by the clinical pharmacist.

SHRESTHA et al.
5.4|Patient-centered medication therapy
The service given by the clinical pharmacist is patient-centered medication therapy management, which is a developing treatment plan that concentrates on each intention associated with a patient's medication. Recently, medication therapy management has been extended as an important initiative, largely due to the need to en- hance patients' medication treatment.62 Most prolonged disease conditions, such as cancer, require that patients persist in treatment indefinitely, even when asymptomatic, in order to meet therapeutic objectives. For the improvement of patients' health-related results, certain pharmacist-managed medication therapy programs should be maintained.63 This will also help to lower the health care cost of the patients.
This is an era of information technology and most hospitals are very much linked to this technology, which can enhance the care of patients. Online computer software for checking DDIs may diminish DDIs. According to the Beers Criteria record, elderly patients should be made aware of the possibility that the wrong medication might be administered. Regulatory authorities should focus on the distri- bution of appropriate medications, such as prescriptions for elderly patients, and also support safer alternatives.64
5.5|Pharmacovigilance center
When it comes to the treatment of cancer patients of any age group, ADRs are being documented universally as one of the unavoidable constituents of management. ADRs are normal and expectable. Once the ADRs are identified, ADR alert stickers or notes mentioning ADRs can be placed in the patient's medical file. This will help in future and alert the concerned physicians.65 Additionally, the information should be circulated to the patients and related doctors.
5.6|Drug information center
The drug information center can play a vital role for elderly cancer patients in providing information on polypharmacy and ADEs. It can also help in the management of polypharmacy. The pharmacist can provide the information to elderly patients on different categories, such as general information of their diseases and medications, how the prescribed medicine works or what it does to the body, possi- ble side-effects and interactions, and duration of the treatments. Elderly patients need information on drugs that are dispensed to them or prescribed.
5.7|Educational intervention and awareness of polypharmacy
Educational intervention and awareness can shape patients' at- titudes toward polypharmacy. Numerous elderly patients strug- gle to deal with their issues in health care. Limited health literacy exaggerates such struggles and creates a greater diversity of

SHRESTHA et al.
adverse health activities and consequences for elderly patients. The effect of a lack of health literacy on the lives of the elderly populace requires greater consideration and understanding from community services practice.66 An elderly populace with little health literacy is at increased risk of nonadherence, unintentional medication experience, and adverse events. Whittaker et al67 rec- ommend educational involvement that can build familiarity with poison inhibition means and medication safety strategies in older adults with low well-being proficiency. Numerous approaches to educational intervention and awareness among patients regarding polypharmacy can be used in elderly patients, such as audiovisual activities, presentations, and brochures in understandable or local languages. Raising physicians' awareness and ventures to support higher experts with respect to polypharmacy and the noxious ef- fects of drug interactions may result in healthier outcomes for el- derly patients.
6|CONCLUSION
This review has successfully discussed the challenges associated with polypharmacy in elderly cancer patients and the ways in which pharmacists can contribute to managing such problems in low- and middle-income settings. Polypharmacy in elderly cancer patients is one of the most important and growing public health issues; it is a grave concern to those who are associated with the management of cancer, such as medical oncologists and other clinicians, as poly- pharmacy is also related to negative health outcomes. The clinical pharmacist has a major role to play in selecting the best interven- tions needed to enhance suitable polypharmacy and consequently managing problems associated with polypharmacy properly to ac- complish better clinical results for patients.

Laparoscopic pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD)/ pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is cautiously regarded as a safe and effective approach in well-selected patients with periampullary cancer. However, postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), delayed gastric emptying (DGE), postoperative bleeding, and sepsis and detrimental complications that can follow PPPD/PD. These complications can result in poor oral intake for a significant period of nothing per oral (NPO) or deterioration of long-term function. A 65-year-old man underwent laparoscopic PPPD for ampulla of vater (AoV) cancer. After surgery, He experienced POPF, DGE, Postoperative bleeding and these complications result in poor oral intake for one month. Approximately 50 days after surgery, an abrupt confused state was noted. He had horizontal nystagmus and ataxia. Abnormal Brain magnetic resonance imaging tomography findings detected in the bilateral medial thalami, dorsal midbrain, and medulla. The association of confusion, ataxia, and horizontal nystagmus along with poor oral intake and the MRI findings suggested acute Wernicke's encephalopathy. After thiamine therapy, He recovered completely. Wernicke's encephalopathy is very rare, but it can progress coma and even death. Therefore, Wernicke's encephalopathy needs to be considered in patients with complicated PPPD/PD associated with malnutrition. (Ann Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg 2019;23:295-299)

INTRODUCTION
Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD)/ pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is a commonly-known, safe, standardized surgical procedure performed on patients with periampullary cancer. Laparoscopic PPPD/PD is cautiously regarded as a safe and effective approach in well-selected patients with periampullary cancer.
However, the complication rate for PPPD/PD is high (delayed gastric emptying (DGE) 45-50%, postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) 15-20%, biliary fistula 4-5%, intra-abdominal hemorrhage 3-5%, UGI hemorrhage 3-5%, etc.), and related surgical mortality is reported to be 1-3%.1 Furthermore, POPF, DGE, postoperative bleeding, and sepsis are detrimental complications that can follow PPPD/ PD. In recent years, most patients have been able to recover due to development of new surgical techniques, in-

terventional radiotherapy, antibiotics, and nutritional support. Nevertheless, these complications can result in poor oral intake for a significant period of nothing per oral (NPO) or deterioration of long-term function. Proper management is important for patient recovery following complicated PPPD/PD.
We report a case of Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) in a patient with ampulla of vater (AoV) cancer with persistent poor oral intake and POPF-grade C after laparoscopic PPPD along with a review of literature.

was noted to be friable and crunch with a 5 mm-sized pancreatic duct. Laparoscopic duct-to-mucosa anastomosis (7 interrupted sutures) for pancreaticojejunostomy with a short stent was performed. The total operation duration was 392 minutes, and the estimated intraoperative blood loss was 150 cc. The patient did not receive an intraoperative transfusion.
In the postoperative period, He had POPF. The drain was removed on postoperative day 16. The patient was expected to go home on postoperative day 21. However, he experienced postoperative hemorrhage and underwent embolization around the common hepatic artery, stump of the gastroduodenal artery (GDA), and the proper hepatic artery from bleeding at the GDA stump. Subsequently, additional percutaneous drain catheters were inserted for multiple intra-abdominal hematomas and abscesses, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were given. Initially we thought that a grade A-POPF had developed. But He finally diagnosed a grade C-POPF. He was temporarily admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and then transferred to the general ward after his vital signs were stable. During the recovery period, the patient suffered repeated nausea and vomiting, and poor oral intake persisted for one month after surgery. Parenteral nutrition and poor oral intake persisted.
Approximately 50 days after surgery, an abrupt confused state was noted. On neurological examination, the patient was awake but disorientated to people, location, and time. A short-memory deficit was also found. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. Motor strength was normal. There were no focal neurological signs or pathological reflexes other than a few hand tremors. However, he had horizontal nystagmus and ataxia. His Nutritional re-assessment was performed at the time of his mental change (Table 1).
Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tomography showed a symmetrically distributed, abnormal, hyperintense signal on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T2-weighted imaging scans in the medial thalami, dorsal midbrain, and medulla (Fig. 1).
The association of confusion, ataxia, and horizontal nystagmus along with poor oral intake and the MRI findings suggested acute WE. The patient's serum thiamine level was 2.3 ug/dl, which is in the lower normal range (reference range, 2.0-7.2 ug/dl). Administration of thiamine (500

He was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 73 with a prescription for vitamin B complex and was advised to watch his diet. He is now in good condition (about 3 months postoperatively), and planned for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.
DISCUSSION
Literature review Using the PubMed database, we identified seven additional patients who suffered from WE following pancreaticoduodenectomy from seven reports. The clinical characteristics of all seven cases are summarized in Table 2. Patient age ranged from 27 to 68 years (median age, 47 years), and there were 5 men (71.4%) and 2 women (28.6%). One patient (14.3%) had confirmed chronic alcohol abuse, while the other cases denied a history of abuse, or it was not specifically mentioned. In most cases, there was a factor exacerbating acute WE, such as poor oral intake, pneumonia, or intestinal obstruction. However, it is interesting to note that WE can occur even in the late postoperative period following PD. For instance, the patients in cases one and four experienced an uneventful recovery and were found to have WE a few years after surgery. However, patients with postoperative complications, such as infection and hemorrhage as in cases 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8, were diagnosed with WE within days or weeks after surgery, which prolonged the length of hospital stay, as in the present case. However, there were many

cases in which the length of the hospitalization was not reported.
WE is an acute neurological disorder resulting from a vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. Thiamine is a watersoluble vitamin absorbed in the duodenum by an active mechanism, and it breaks through the blood-brain barrier by active and passive mechanisms.2 The main cause of thiamine deficiency is alcohol abuse. Among others, notable causes include chronic dietary deficiency (unbalanced diet or parenteral nutrition without thiamine), poor absorption or low intake (celiac disease, pyloric obstruction, recurrent vomiting, or gravidic hyperemesis), excessive intake of carbohydrates in relation to the supply of thiamine, and a greater need for nutrients (growth, exercise, pregnancy, or infection).2,3 The clinical presentation of the typical classic triad of ataxia, confusion, and nystagmus is present in 16-38% of patients.4
In the present case, the patient had the classic clinical triad of nystagmus, ataxia, and confusion. He had several possible causative factors for acute WE: deficiency of thiamine absorption after PPPD, long-time poor oral intake, and vomiting associated with postoperative complications. In addition, these were exacerbated by lack of supply of thiamine in long-time parenteral nutrition and increased requirement of vitamin B1 secondary to sepsis following grade C-POPF.
The Nutritional support for postoperative complication patient after PPPD is the key of conservative therapy.5 Postoperative early resumption of oral intake is safe and should be encouraged within enhanced recovery protocols.6-9 In patient with POPF, There is no evidence of the benefit of avoiding oral intake in clinically stable patients.6 Grade A-POPF and stabilized Grade B-POPF can start oral intake.6 But severe Grade B-POPF and Grade C-POPF have to avoid oral intake.6 During avoid oral intake, an artificial nutritional support is needed.10 Enteral nutrition is preferred whenever possible over parenteral nutrition.5 Nasogastric tube insertion or Nasojejunal tube insertion, feeding gastrostomy, feeding jejunostomy can be performed.6 If enteral nutrition is difficult, we can choose parenteral nutrition. For more effective parenteral nutrition, central venous catheterization is required. In addition, periodic nutritional checks is important and be supplemented with insufficient trace elements, vitamins, albumin, to prevent nutritional imbalances.

PPPD is associated with many complications and their
associated DGE, which inevitably leads to long-term NPO
or poor oral intake. Most of these patients have underlying
sepsis, and physicians should rule out septic progression
to diagnose WE when the patient has mental changes. In
this case, septic progression was ruled out by follow-up
abdominal CT showing evidence of decreased intra-ab-
dominal abscesses.
In summary, postoperative acute WE is very rare, but
it can develop in patients with PPPD/PD. If a patient who
underwent a complicated PPPD/PD is of older age, has
poor oral intake associated with a postoperative complica-
tion, or is in poor general condition, physicians must con-
sider the possibility of acute WE when the patient experi-
ences acute mental changes without specific reason. Serum
thiamine level by itself may not be useful for diagnosis
of WE, but brain MRI can be helpful.
WE is a rare disease, and it is difficult to detect. Left
untreated, patients can progress to coma and even death.
Therefore, WE needs to be considered in patients with
complicated PPPD/PD associated with malnutrition.

ABSTRACT Background: Dental care is an important aspect of oral health which deals with the maintenance of healthy teeth and it is an important aspect of general oral health. Dental care practices include regular tooth brushing and flossing, healthy nutritional habits and regular visits to the dentists. Objective: This was to determine the practice of dental hygiene among undergraduate students of Adeleke University. Methodology: This was a cross-sectional survey conducted among Adeleke University undergraduate students between February and March, 2017. A stratified sampling technique was used to select study participants. A semi structured questionnaire was used for data collection and data were analyzed using SPSS version 21. Bivariate analysis was done with chi squared test. Level of significance was set at 5%. Results: Mean age of respondents was 20.18 + 2.61 years. Half of the respondents (53.6%) brushed their teeth twice daily. Most (79.2%) of the respondents used toothpick to remove food debris from their teeth and only 9.1% used dental floss. Only 54.7% had ever visited the dentist in their lifetime. Respondents who were single had good dental practice compared to respondents that were married (p>0.05). Conclusion: The practice of dental hygiene among the students is not adequate. There is a need to inform and educate the students on dental hygiene practices and the benefits.

Keywords: Dental care practices, Undergraduate students, Adeleke University

INTRODUCTION Oral health is a state of being free from mouth and facial pain, oral sores and infections, periodontal (gum) disease, tooth decay, tooth loss, and other diseases and disorders that limit an individual's capacity in biting, chewing, smiling, speaking, and psychosocial wellbeing.1 Dental care is an important aspect of oral health which deals with the maintenance of healthy teeth and it is an important aspect of general oral health. The mouth is the major gateway to the body hence, oral health is essential to the general health and quality of life.2 The practice of regular dental care, otherwise known as oral hygiene, helps in keeping the mouth and teeth clean in order to prevent dental diseases.3 Basic dental care involves brushing and flossing of the teeth regularly, seeing a dentist for regular checkups and cleanings. In a broader perspective, oral hygiene is the practice of keeping the mouth and teeth clean to prevent dental problems, most commonly, dental cavities, gingivitis, periodontal (gum) diseases and bad breath.1,4 Oral care practices such as brushing with fluoride toothpaste, dental flossing, regular dental checkup

including cleaning the teeth professionally at least twice a year, are recommended measures for maintaining good oral health.5 Studies by Kempe et al. showed that poor oral hygiene, such as not brushing, not flossing, or not rinsing enough can lead to gum disease and tooth decay.6 The longer food particles are allowed to stay in the mouth, the greater the chance of decay. So the mouth should be rinsed immediately after eating, especially sugary substances to prevent the formation of plaque.7 In a study conducted by Ogunrinde et al., it was documented that students and adolescents in Nigeria faced challenges regarding their oral health because of the daily high consumption of sugary foods and drinks, which predisposed them to dental caries and periodontal disease coupled with poor oral hygiene. 8,9 According to Akpata, dental caries constitutes one of the major oral health problems with its prevalence as high as 20 to 45% among school children and adolescents in Nigeria.10 Periodontal diseases was found in 15-58% in those aged above 15 years, while a national survey involving 7630 persons from the 6 geo political zones in Nigeria reported that only 26.4%

had visited the dentist, 10.5%, used dental floss and 42.0% brushed twice daily.11 It is recommended that the teeth be brushed regularly with tooth brush using fluoride containing toothpaste at least twice a day in order to prevent dental caries and maintain good oral hygiene.12 However, there is limited data on dental care practices among undergraduate students especially of private institutions in Nigeria. This study was therefore designed to provide baseline data on the dental care practices among undergraduate students of Adeleke University, Osun State, Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study area This study was conducted in Adeleke University, Ede, Osun State. Adeleke University (AU) is situated in an ambient and serene environment at Ede, Osun State, Nigeria. The University has six faculties and twenty departments. These faculties are; Faculty of Business and Social Sciences (FBSS), Faculty of Arts (FOA), Faculty of Science (FOS), Faculty of Law (FOL), Faculty of Engineering (FOE) and Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences (FBMS). The departments are; Accounting, Business Administration, Economics, Library and Information Science, Mass Communication, Political Science and Public Administration, History and International Studies, English Language and Literary Studies, Religious Studies, Microbiology, Biochemistry, Computer Science, Computer Information Science (CIS), Law, Agricultural Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Public Health, Nursing, Anatomy and physiology.

Data analysis Data was inspected, cleaned, checked for completeness and entered into the computer using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21. A total of 11 questions covering dental practices were asked and every correct answer was scored 1 and every wrong answer was scored 0. The mean score was computed and respondents scoring below the mean were classified as having poor dental care practice while respondents who had scores above the mean were classified as having good dental care practice. The results were presented using proportions, tables and charts. Chi squared test was used to test for associations and level of significance was set at 5%. RESULTS Three hundred and seventy-five respondents participated in the study. Socio-demographic information of respondents is shown in Table 1. Respondents aged 20 to 24 years constituted 54.4% of respondents. Forty-one percent of the respondents were aged 15 to 19 years, 4.5% of the respondents were aged 25 to 29 years. The mean age of respondents was 20.182.61 years. About fifty one percent (50.7%) female students. Most of the respondents (70.4%) were Christians. Respondents who were of Yoruba ethnicity constituted 62.7% of the respondents. The majority of the respondents (96.3%) were never married. Respondents' practice of dental care Respondents' practice of dental care is shown in Table 2a. Half of the respondents (53.6%) brushed morning and night, 44.5% brushed only in the morning and 5% brushed only at night. Almost eighty percent (79.2%) of the respondents used toothpick to remove food

A total of 62.9% of the respondents had heard about dental floss, while 37.1% had never heard about dental floss. About half (54.7%) of the respondents had ever visited a dentist for treatment and examination of their mouth, while 45.3% had never visited a dentist.

Respondents who were singles had good dental practice compared to respondents that were married (p>0.05). Those of the Yoruba ethnicity had good dental practice compared to the other ethnic groups p>0.05. DISCUSSION This study documented baseline data on dental care practices among Adeleke University undergraduate students. This study showed that half of the respondents brushed their teeth twice daily. This proportion is just slightly higher than the report documented by Olusile et al 11 in a study among adults in Nigeria which stated that 42% of the respondents reported brushing their teeth twice daily. However, the result is much higher than 8.1% of respondents who brushed twice daily as reported in a study by Braimoh in a study on oral selfcare practices among university students in Port

Harcourt and 14.6% reported by Kumar in a study knowledge about dental care practices through their on oral awareness among college students in India.13.14 field of study.

This could be because students rush through the routine of cleaning the mouth and teeth because of their class schedule and at the end of the day, they get so tired that they don't bother to clean the teeth after dinner. Most of the respondents used toothbrush and toothpaste as oral hygiene tools. This is similar to the study by Ogunrinde et al on dental care knowledge and practice among adolescents which showed that 93.0% of the respondents used tooth brush and paste and also the study by Olusile et al which documented that the vast majority of the study respondents used toothbrush and toothpaste as oral hygiene tools.8,11 More than half of the respondents never visited a dentist the year prior to the survey. This is similar to a study by Sofola et al where majority of the respondents never visited a dentist and also in a study by Okoye et al where over half of the respondents never visited a dentist. Similarly, a national study documented that less than 20% Nigerians visit a dentist. 15,16,17 About two fifth of the respondents (44.0%) used medium bristles, 26.9% used soft bristles and 19.5% used hard bristles. The proportion of respondents who used medium and hard bristles in this report is slightly lower than what was documented in a study by Braimoh et al on oral self-care practices among university students which stated that 52.2% of his respondents used medium bristles, 30% used hard bristles. However, more respondents used soft bristles in our report as compared with the study by Braimoh (17.5%).13 About 50.4% of the participants used fluoridated toothpaste, 17.3% used toothpastes without fluoride while 32.3% were not sure if the toothpaste they use contained fluoride. This report showed that more than half of the respondents were aware of the fluoride content of the toothpaste they used unlike in a study by Adeyemi et al which documented that 20% of the study respondents used fluoride-containing toothpastes, 10.5% used toothpastes without fluoride while more than half (69.6%) of the respondents were not sure if the toothpaste they used contain fluoride.18 Only 9.1% of the respondents used dental floss out of 62.9% that had heard of dental floss. This is similar to a report by Braimoh et al in a study among university students in Port Harcourt which documented that 6% of the respondents used dental floss; however, this report is lower than 19% reported by Ayanbadejo in a study among College of Medicine students. 13,19 This could probably be because the College of Medicine students had access to information and better

CONCLUSION This study revealed that the practice of dental hygiene among undergraduate students of Adeleke University is inadequate. In view of the importance of good dental hygiene and the poor health impact of dental problems, we recommend that the university medical center should provide the students with dental health education in order to instill good dental hygiene information and practice in the students.

Cavernous Malformation of a Thoracic Spinal Nerve Root: Case Report and Review of Literature

Abstract Intradural extramedullary spinal cavernous malformations (CMs) remain the least common variant of these lesions and can originate from the inner surface of the dura mater, the pial surface of the spinal cord, and the blood vessels in the spinal nerves. Rootbasedonly extramedullary CMs are very rare in the thoracic region with only four cases reported. We present a case of 56yearold male with 1year progression of lower extremities weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a hyperintense lesion in the upper thoracic region. Surgical exploration revealed a CM with origin in the second thoracic nerve root with gross total resection. Histopathological examination confirmed a CM. The patient had complete recovery of neurological function at 3 months interval. Intradural extramedullary CM is extremely rare entity that must be considered in the differential diagnosis of intradural extramedullary lesions. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice to prevent further neurological damage.

Introduction
Cavernous malformations (CMs) are common benign vascular lesions composed of endotheliumlined vascular channels without intervening normal parenchyma, neural, or glial elements.[1,2] These lesions belong to a group of vascular malformations that are developmental anomalies of the vascular bed.[3] Spinal CMs account for 5%-12% of spinal vascular malformations with only 3% located intradurally.[4,5] Intradural extramedullary spinal CMs remain the least common variant of these lesions. Specifically, thoracic rootbasedonly extramedullary CMs are very rare with only four cases reported. We describe the case of a patient with a CM arising from a thoracic nerve root in which surgery was performed.
Case Report
A 56yearold man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II presented with 1 year progression of lower extremity numbness and weakness that was initially attributed to diabetic peripheral neuropathy. However, progression of symptoms was rapid, with patient being nonambulatory within 6 months. The deterioration prompted a full spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which revealed an enhancing mass with

examination revealed an encapsulated tissue with a lumen filled with hemorrhage, large thinwalled dilated vessels lined by flattened endothelium with no elastic lamina, consistent with a CM [Figure 4]. Postoperative course was uneventful with nearcomplete recovery of motor and sensory deficits. Followup evaluation at 3 months demonstrated complete recovery of preoperative deficits.
Review of Literature
Table 1 illustrates the ten cases that have been reported in the literature of intradural extramedullary CMs in the thoracic spine. The presenting age of the patients are

between 22 and 67 years, with a mean of 47 years. The majority of patients were male, representing a 70% of cases. In the same manner, the majority of cases (70%) were located in the midthoracic and lowerthoracic region. The presenting symptoms consisted of subarachnoid hemorrhage in three patients, sensorimotor disturbances in six patients, and one patient presenting with isolated back pain. Urinary disturbances consisting of sphincter dysfunction and urinary retention were also present in two patients in addition to sensorimotor disturbances. Gross total resection was achieved in nine patients, with only one case of subtotal resection due to significant adherence to the spinal cord. Excellent outcomes were obtained in six patients, no improvement was seen in two patients, and

worsening of neurological deficits was observed in one patient; one case had no report of postoperative outcome.
Discussion
CMs are benign vascular lesions of the neural axis: an intradural extramedullary location is the rarest.[69] MRI is the study of choice for these lesions.[10,11] Intradural extramedullary CMs can be homogeneously or heterogeneous hyperintense in T1weighted images. They can be hyperintense in T2weighted images, and gadolinium enhancement is frequent but not necessary.[12] MRI findings of hemorrhage are variable, depending on severity and stage.[13] Microscopic examination consists of irregular sinusoidal vascular spaces lacking intervening neural or glial tissue lined by a single layer of endothelium.[1416] Recurrent hemorrhages in CMs lead to enlargement and further compression of adjacent structures; it also causes thrombosis of vascular channels that can necrotize and perpetuate further hemorrhages.[16,17] Patients with intradural extramedullary CMs develop symptoms secondary to a spaceoccupying lesion, either due to hemorrhage, cord edema, or cord impingement.[13,1820] Surgical removal remains the standard of care in the treatment of these lesions in symptomatic patients and should be done in an expedited manner to prevent further neurological deterioration as conservative management offers no chance for improvement in symptoms.[2023] There is no role for endovascular treatment of CMs as these vascular lesions are not amenable to embolization due to their cytoarchitecture.[23] CMs in the spinal cord are usually welldemarcated lesions with welldefined planes, permitting a safe resection with excellent outcomes.[16] Intraoperatively, intradural extramedullary CMs tend to be intrinsically adherent to the nerve roots and/or spinal cord, which favors an origin in the blood vessels on the surface of nerve roots and spinal cord.[16] Surgical procedures may be technically difficult, due to the formation of dense adhesions between the CM and the nerve roots/spinal cord.[16] In some cases, dissection of the involved nerve root becomes challenging, and a decision must be taken if sacrificing the involved root is acceptable.[16] In our case, the gradual worsening of symptoms correlates with suspected microhemorrhage causing increase in size and subsequent cord compression. Preoperative MRI in our patient was not pathognomonic of a CM; thus, our differential diagnosis included ependymoma, schwanomma, and neurofibroma. Surgical exploration in our patient revealed a densely adherent CM to the second thoracic nerve root; it was decided to sacrifice the root to prevent further manipulation that could result in a spinal cord injury. In our patient, full neurological recovery was seen at 3 months.
Conclusion
Although extremely rare, intradural extramedullary CMs must be considered in the differential diagnosis of

intradural extramedullary lesions. Neurological recovery is dependent on the severity of preoperative symptoms. The optimal treatment remains surgical en bloc resection to prevent further neurological damage.

Abstract: This paper describes the development and use of the bespoke digital learning resource CAPSULE (Clinical and Professional Studies Unique Learning Environment) which was launched UK wide in May 2020 to facilitate the delivery of core learning content for UK medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. CAPSULE is a digital learning resource comprising case-based scenarios and multiple-choice questions, encompassing all undergraduate medical specialities and supported by a pan-speciality editorial board. Following the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and loss of face-to-face learning opportu nities, CAPSULE was made available to all UK medical schools in May 2020. Following a global content review and edit and UK wide rollout, over 41,000 medical students and 3200 faculty registered as users. Approximately 1.5 million cases were completed in the first 12 months of use by up to 4500 distinct monthly users. Feedback from both students and faculty has been highly positive. CAPSULE continues to be used within UK medical schools and has allowed an entire cohort of medical students to access core curriculum content and progress their studies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future directions may include further integration into UK medical school curricula, enhancement of platform functionality and potential expansion on an international scale.

Introduction
The nature of undergraduate medical education has seen a shift in recent years as a result of the increased availability and accessibility of advanced digital computer technology.1 Online learning is increasingly utilised to meet the educational requirements of medical students,2 complementing more traditional methods of education. Available online learning resources include teaching videos, question banks, practical and examination skill guides,3 clinical guidelines and 3-dimensional anatomy.4 Whilst these applications were initially only suitable for computers or laptops, the development of mobile apps has allowed a transition into educational delivery independent of the location of the user. Medical students now use online learning and mobile apps to learn anatomy, physiology, pathology, disease investigation, diagnosis and management.2 This transition from purely traditional face-to-face learning to the combination use of face-to-face learning with digital resources is referred to as blended learning.5
This paper is a descriptive account of the development of CAPSULE (Clinical and Professional Studies Unique Learning Environment), a bespoke digital learning resource and collaborative enterprise. The paper then reviews the subsequent

United Kingdom (UK) wide launch of CAPSULE in May 2020 to support UK medical students in accessing their course learning requirements in response to the loss of face-to-face learning opportunities during the COVID19 pandemic.
CAPSULE Initial Development
CAPSULE is a clinical case-based learning resource first developed by Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS) in the UK. Originally launched in 2007 using the local university learning management system quiz tool, it was designed to provide final-year medical students with equitable access to learning resources during regional clinical placements. It was initially comprised of over 250 clinical case-based scenarios with multiple choice (single/ multiple answer) questions and a rich library of clinical images (radiological, electrocardiograms, drug charts and clinical photos) to support students in accessing knowl edge of investigation, diagnosis, and management. The resource had a focus on formative assessment and strong emphasis on feedback for case answers.
All cases/questions were written by clinicians practis ing at senior trainee or consultant level, experienced in setting questions suitable for medical students in terms of level of difficulty and relevance to the course. Case writers were supported by a pan-speciality editorial board. The content and scope of the cases aligned with the General Medical Council (GMC) curriculum Outcomes for Graduates (formerly Tomorrow's Doctors)6 and the BSMS Year 5 curriculum, covering the breadth of all specialities within undergraduate medicine. A rolling pro cess of case review, case editing and case additions was established, supported by regular editorial review of con tent to ensure it remained accurate and aligned to the teaching programme.
By 2016, the learning resource had expanded to approximately 600 cases, 3000 questions and 400 images, and the content was made available to BSMS medical students in Years 3, 4 and 5. Annual feedback from stu dents consistently highlighted the perceived benefits of content written by faculty and provision via the medical school (as opposed to a commercial company). Feedback did also highlight the lack of mobile/tablet compatibility, which was of increasing importance to students. BSMS then invested in a new bespoke platform though collabora tion with a local digital solutions company, Ocasta

Studios, to deliver a high-quality digital system optimised for mobile and tablet use. This new interface was success fully launched in 2017 to BSMS medical students and subsequent student feedback was extremely positive.
By early 2020, CAPSULE had been adopted as a software subscription by four additional UK medical schools, on a not-for-profit basis, with proceeds from sub scriptions being re-invested into platform maintenance and development. Participating schools varied in their use of CAPSULE according to their individual course structure, with some including early years medical students and others allowing access to senior clinical students only. The total number of student users in early 2020 was approximately 3500.
CAPSULE Functionality and Learning Design
CAPSULE employs key learning design features based on user feedback and educational expertise. Figures 1-5 pro vide selected screenshots of the current platform interface.
Specialty Approach
Students can work through cases within specialty, for example to support their learning during a particular clin ical placement. Content is separated into 42 specialty sec tions under four main categories (medicine, surgery, other specialties, therapeutics; see Figures 1 and 2).
Quiz Approach
Students can assemble cases into a "Quiz" based on cer tain selection criteria: either a random selection generated by the system or by the student filtering by parameters including topic tags, previous performance, or previous attempts. Quizzes provide students with more targeted, personalised learning and can be saved to their mobile device for use offline, a key requirement for placementbased learning.
Question Format and Images
The majority of questions are multiple choice (single answer or multiple answer; Figure 3) and a small propor tion of questions are ranking or matching style (Figure 4) to deliver a broader question style. Many questions are linked with an image (radiology, pathology, clinical drug chart, electrocardiogram or echocardiogram) to give stu dents a better visualisation of disease and support diag nostic interpretation.

Feedback on Performance
Paramount to the learning efficacy is the feedback on each question with detailed answers and feedback regarding disease diagnosis, investigation, and management, linked to current guidelines where relevant (Figures 3 and 4). If they wish, students are also provided with breakdown of their average performance across the four main categories and with comparison against their year cohort average score (Figure 5).
Feedback on the System
The system includes opportunity for students to flag any case for investigation by the editorial team (technical or content). This triggers investigation and response from the faculty, engages the students in quality control, and helps maintain content accuracy.

Mitigating the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic had serious consequences for the delivery of undergraduate medical education in the UK (and worldwide). In March 2020, hospitals temporarily suspended medical attachments for clinical medical students7 and universities suspended all face-to-face teach ing, including that for medical students.8 There was con cern amongst UK medical schools and the Medical Schools Council (MSC) that this reduction in formal teaching, clinical exposure and patient contact would negatively impact the acquisition of knowledge and clin ical competencies for medical students and also reduce student to doctor transition at a critical time where more doctors were needed.7 To minimise this disruption, UK medical schools had to adapt quickly with recognition

that the medical curriculum would need to be delivered remotely and online.9 During this period of change and uncertainty, CAPSULE was identified by the MSC as a digital learning resource that could potentially support UK clinical medical student education.
Following discussions with senior faculty at BSMS, Imperial College London (a partner CAPSULE user since 2018) and Ocasta (the technological partner), the MSC provided core-funding to cover the technological costs of a UK-wide expansion of CAPSULE to all UK medical schools as an additional learning support. Volunteer medical school clinical editors from across the UK worked with the CAPSULE (Q/A) team at BSMS to accomplish a full qual ity assurance review of case content. Ocasta Studios devel oped the technical capability to support large-scale

expansion, supported in part by a successful bid for a UK government emergency COVID-19 related grant. In addi tion to this, cases were "tagged" with keywords from a taxonomy comprised of the presentations of illness and conditions listed in the GMC's Medical Licencing Assessment MLA Content Map.10 This ensured that the content was aligned to the national examination due to replace UK final year medical school exams (and the Professional and Linguistic Assessments Board test for international medical graduates) in academic year 2024/ 2025. Further cases were added to meet content gaps, to bring the total number to 700 cases, 3700 questions, and 500 images. CAPSULE was made freely available to all UK medical schools on the 1st of May 2020, with free access to continue until September 2021.

UK-Wide Usage of CAPSULE and Feedback
Following the UK Wide launch on the 1st of May 2020, all 33 UK medical schools registered with CAPSULE, com prising a total of 41,404 medical students and 3187 faculty. The number of monthly cases completed and the number of monthly users of CAPSULE showed a substantial increase between May 2020 and June 2020. During the first 12 months of use, approximately 1.5 million cases were completed in total. By September 2020, students largely returned to clinical pla cements, yet the number of users of CAPSULE showed an increase, demonstrating its integration into student learn ing patterns. At the current time, the number of cases

being completed monthly are approximately 140,000 and current numbers of distinct monthly users are approxi mately 4500. These usage patterns are illustrated in Figures 6 and 7.
Feedback from UK students and faculty using CAPSULE has been highly positive, with selected, anon ymised student comments presented below in Table 1.
Discussion and Conclusions Changes to Medical Education
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, online learning within the entire educational sector has become a key component in teaching and learning. A survey of UK medical schools demonstrated this increased reliance on

online learning, showing that prior to the COVID-19 pan demic, medical students would on average spend 4 to 6 hours weekly engaging in online learning, whilst during the pandemic, this increased to 7 to 10 hours weekly.11 Prior to the pandemic, 7.35% of students would regularly spend >15 hours a week doing online learning and during the pandemic, this increased to 19.7%.11

There are reported benefits to online learning, includ ing greater time flexibility, comfort, reduced travelling, reduced anxiety and ability to study the course from another country should travelling restrictions exist.11 However, there are also reported disadvantages, with stu dents citing undermotivation, internet connectivity pro blems and lack of practical application as particular

drawbacks.11 The lack of alignment of generic question banks and online learning resources to specific medical school curricula is also a significant disadvantage.12
With the emergence of new coronavirus variants and the possibility of further outbreak and lockdown possi ble in the UK and across the world, it is likely that online learning will continue to significantly support medical education for the foreseeable future. Even beyond the COVID-19 era, the advantages of online learning may make it likely that blended learning remains the norm for higher education, including med ical education.11
The Impact of CAPSULE as a Learning Resource
A recent study, undertaken prior to COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrated the impact of CAPSULE in helping medical students improve their knowledge and translate this to better summative examination scores.13 This cross-

sectional study reviewed the performance of the 2019 graduating cohort of 70 medical students at BSMS, who had had access to CAPSULE during their fourth and fifth years of study. Following their final examinations, the students' CAPSULE meta-data and decile rankings were obtained and compared. This was compared against the students' decile at the beginning of their third year of study, prior to access to CAPSULE.
This study demonstrated that students who completed more cases on CAPSULE scored significantly higher marks overall in their exams (p < 0.0037) and that students with a better score on CAPSULE were part of a stronger decile within their cohort (p < 0.019).13 This study pro vided evidence that digital learning with CAPSULE may be associated with better exam performance.13
A further benefit of CAPSULE, for UK medical stu dents and international graduates looking to come to the UK, is its alignment with the MLA. This can ensure that those preparing for the examination achieve breadth and

depth in areas where direct experience may be limited in order to ensure that all areas of the assessment map are sampled with formative questions. This makes CAPSULE a sustainable and up to date learning resource with in-built longevity.
Possible Future Directions of CAPSULE
Discussions are ongoing as to how CAPSULE provi sion to UK medical schools continues beyond September 2021. A key component to success at med ical school level is the effective engagement of school faculty, who in turn will promote interest and usage by their students. A key element to faculty engagement is to encourage faculty members to review and add spe ciality cases to the platform, which can be targeted towards their interests and individual medical school curricula. These cases can then be formally embedded within teaching.

There is also potential for faculty to identify underper forming students and to offer them additional targeted edu cational support or to identify particular questions or subject areas in which students are underperforming and consider focused teaching interventions. Extra functionalities and bespoke content may also be added to the platform, as suggested by partner schools.
CASPULE is an excellent example of how a digital learn ing resource can be used successfully to complement existing teaching modalities and help students improve their knowl edge and required competencies. CAPSULE has already demonstrated its efficacy as a teaching resource and its scal ability by early 2020, with COVID-19 providing the stimulus to facilitate UK-wide expansion and delivery of educational content in support of a UK-wide cohort of medical students. In the future, there is the potential for CAPSULE to expand further, to other healthcare-related disciplines and interna tionally, to benefit medical students on a wider scale.

Table 1 Selected Feedback from User Survey from Students Across the UK, to the Question, "What Do You Value Most About CAPSULE?" Consent for Publication Gained

Student 1

Very relevant to undergraduate learning outcomes. Clearly explained answers and cases. Bolsters understanding of conditions as a whole.

Student 2

Use it mainly for revision as the format of questions is similar style to my exam and the feedback given is extremely helpful. Easy format to understand and I enjoy having it as an app as well as on my laptop.

Student 3

Really good cases with thoughtful questions and excellent feedback/explanation on answers.

Student 4

The fact that we get to study with cases and follow through from diagnosis to treatment. It helps me consider aspects of management I would not have previously. The questions are at an appropriate level.

Student 5

The application of knowledge to work through a case is realistic to questions doctors ask on placement. I use it after I have made revision notes to check my understanding and apply knowledge to cases/ exam questions.

Student 6

I like the case-based questioning - and how the story unfolds within the case. The feedback is also really valuable.

Student 7

I enjoy the range of questions and the depth of the questions. Good for revising what you do and do not know about conditions. I like how can choose specialties.

Student 8

I love that the cases and questions are written in the same structure as I would have it in an exam. The rationales given for the answers are very helpful as they further help me build my knowledge. This has been a wonderful study resource for me.

Student 9

I use it to make notes and learn. It is great because it is an interactive way of learning. I love the range of subjects it covers and the detailed feedback.

Student 10

I used it heavily in preparation for my year 3 exams using the questions in surgery, medicine, elderly medicine and psychiatry. I really appreciate how the questions match the learning outcomes for each module as it is a great way to consolidate my knowledge. I also found it really helpful that it was a case study-based approach with aspects of the history, examination, investigations and results for interpretation.

Student 11

You are great! Please keep up the good work. I genuinely impressed a consultant on the wards when I spotted a (real!) patient with potential hypothyroidism thanks to a capsule case I had recently done.

Universal heart coverage for children with heart disease in India
Raman Krishna Kumar
Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Center, Kochi, Kerala, India

INTRODUCTION
On August 7, 2004 hundreds of children, suffering from heart problems, along with their parents arrived at Ambedkar Bhavan at Lower Tank Bund in Hyderabad on Friday, following an assurance from a social activist that he would seek the help of the Chief Minister, Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy, and ensure that all children got free treatment. A 12-year-old boy with congenital heart defect (CHD) who attended the rally died moments before the rally was to be taken out. This sparked a widespread public outrage in the state.[1] A week later, the Chief Minister of the state, Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy publically expressed a desire to cover all families below the poverty line under the proposed universal health insurance scheme with lowest possible premium. He specifically mentioned that the scheme would provide for surgeries to children suffering from heart ailments.[2] It is widely acknowledged that the best-known state sponsored public insurance program in India, the Aarogyasri Scheme, was triggered by this particular event. The Aarogyasri Scheme spelt out a strong mandate to cover the health needs of the poorest. Notwithstanding its shortcomings the Aarogyasri Scheme has become a model of universal health coverage for many other states in India and perhaps for the nation as a whole.[3]
Universal heart coverage (UHC) can be defined as the existence of a legal mandate for universal access to health services and evidence that suggests the vast majority of the population has meaningful access.[4] The ability of a country to provide universal health coverage for all its citizens is a powerful indicator of its development. India ranks among the lowest in the world when it comes to public health spending and among the highest for out of pocket health spending (172 of 190). This is reflected

in key health indices that are sensitive to the quality of primary care such as infant and maternal mortality. Today, India ranks lower than Nepal, Bangladesh and Botswana in infant mortality.[5]
Starting in 2005 with the establishment of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) there has been an effort by the government to improve health coverage in India. In January 2015, the Indian Government released the National Health Policy (NHP). The NHP prominently includes in its goal "universal access to good quality health care services without anyone having to face financial hardship as a consequence."[6]
More recently, the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) scheme was announced specifically for children in India. This is a new initiative aimed at screening over 270 million children from 0 to 18 years for four Ds -- Defects at birth, Diseases, Deficiencies and Development delays, including disabilities. It is stated on the first page of the operational guideline that children diagnosed with illnesses shall receive the follow-up, including surgeries at tertiary level, free of cost under NRHM. CHDs and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) figure prominently in the list of conditions included for universal coverage under RBSK scheme.[7]
Comprehensive pediatric heart care that seeks to address all forms of pediatric heart disease can be resource intensive. Only the most advanced countries with robust health systems and the high gross domestic product can provide care for all cardiac conditions that affect children. Even in these nations, it is quite challenging to provide comprehensive care for every single child with heart disease regardless of complexity. In most low and middle-income nations, including India, only a small

fraction of children with heart disease can expect to receive comprehensive care in today's times.[8]
The purpose of this editorial is to explore how pediatric heart care can be included in a national effort towards universal health coverage. I will start by summarizing the situation with pediatric heart care in the country and list the specific challenges when it comes to attempting to provide coverage for every single child with heart disease in India. This will be followed by an attempt to draft a roadmap for inclusion of pediatric heart care in the universal health coverage agenda.
THE BURDEN OF PEDIATRIC HEART DISEASE
The burden of pediatric heart disease in India is likely to be the largest among all nations in the world simply because of the fact that there are more children born in India than anywhere else.
Congenital heart disease
Two recent surveys at birth have provided the basis of estimating the burden of congenital heart disease (CHD) in India.[9,10] Using the larger and more recently published study, it can be estimated that approximately 100,000 babies are born each year with "major" and "critical" CHD. These CHDs include a list of condition that need to be addressed early, mostly within the 1st year of life. Recognizing the fact that majority of those born with CHD do not receive timely treatment, the overall burden of children and adults with unoperated CHD is likely to be considerable in India.
Rheumatic heart disease
The most recent nationwide surveys under the Jaivigyan Mission Mode (JVM) Project provide estimates of ~1/1000 of clinical RHD.[11,12] Because the JVM project did not include the least developed parts of the country the burden is likely to be underestimated. Even so, the burden of RHD in India is likely to be at least 2 million and a substantial proportion of the affected individuals are children and adolescents.[12]
Other pediatric heart disease such as idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, Kawasaki disease, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, rhythm disorders and, Takayasu arteritis, are all well characterized in the Indian context. They all need specialized attention, ideally in pediatric heart programs. Absolute numbers are likely to be substantial given the Nations Population and age distribution and perhaps beyond the capacity of existing pediatric heart programs.
Lifestyle related conditions such as hypertension and childhood obesity are on a rapid rise in urban populations.[13,14] Preventive programs need to be
178

instituted on a massive scale to mitigate the ongoing epidemic of adult cardiovascular disease that has its origins in adverse childhood lifestyles.
AVAILABLE RESOURCES FOR PEDIATRIC HEART CARE
Given the fact that maximum attrition from most forms of CHD happens in the 1st year of life, a meaningful reduction in CHD-related deaths could only be accomplished through correction in the 1st year of life, in most instances through an open-heart operation. Infant and newborn open-heart surgery are among the most resource-intensive endeavors in medicine and outcomes are the exquisitely sensitive quality of services. It is generally recommended that one infant and newborn heart surgery program with the capability of performing 200-500 operations is required for 5-10 million people.[15] This would translate into a requirement of at least a thousand pediatric heart centers for all of India. Perhaps because of the specific challenges, dedicated pediatric cardiac programs have been slow to develop in India.[8] As of 2015 it can be estimated that there are less than 50 centers in India with the capability of infant and newborn open-heart surgery and a minimum annual caseload of 200 operations. The majority of these are a part of "for-profit institutions" and fewer than 10 of these are in the government sector. While the shortfall in an actual number of centers is in excess of 900, an equally important consideration is the distribution of pediatric heart programs. Over 90% of the pediatric heart programs are located in the western half of the country (West of the Kanpur-Chennai line). Many large states have no pediatric heart program. There are no programs for the entire northeastern region [Figure 1]. It is important to recognize that pediatric heart programs need to develop as a part of a large health care ecosystem

rather than as isolated entities. Pediatric heart care, particularly for infant and newborns, are effective if they are carefully integrated into an organized and mature referral network of primary and secondary level pediatric caregivers with effective referral and transportation systems.[15] Clustering of many programs in metros would not allow for efficiency and would foster unhealthy competition. Unfortunately, this is exactly what seems to have happened. Most programs in the western half of India are clustered in and around large metropolitan cities. They largely cater to relatively affluent sections of the society resulting a rather ridiculous situation of competition among programs for patients in the face of a massive shortfall in overall coverage. While the costs of care are beyond the reach of many Indian families, these centers have become a destination for an increasing number of children from other countries because they are quite affordable in comparison to high-income nations. These disturbing contradictions are a simple reflection of the fact that health care in India is not organized in accordance with societal needs.
Very few of the existing pediatric heart centers in India can be considered truly comprehensive by prevailing western standards. Almost all programs are working to full capacity in the face of a shortfall of human and material resources and limitations in infrastructure.[8] Most programs are forced to share resources with busy adult cardiac programs without which they would not be economically viable. The most serious deficiencies are in nursing, intensive care physicians and dedicated pediatric heart surgeons with the capability to perform infant and newborn cardiac surgery.[16] There is also a serious lack of ability to provide timely diagnosis and referral and general awareness of the magnitude of the problem among the primary health care professionals, resulting in late presentation or, often, untimely death.
While RHD often affects older children and can be managed in centers that do not perform infant and newborn heart operations, advanced care (surgery and catheter intervention) for RHD is still quite expensive. Children affected with RHD are typically from marginalized sections of the society with little or no access to heart programs with reasonable quality to ensure predictably good outcomes.[12]

The massive shortfall in resources available for pediatric heart care needs to be understood by all stakeholders, especially policy planners. As long as this shortfall prevails, announcements on universal coverage (such as the RBSK scheme) can only be considered to be

aspirational statements. It is necessary to develop several hundred new pediatric programs that are geographically distributed in accordance with regional needs. It must also be understood that pediatric heart does not surface as a priority unless infant mortality from readily preventable causes declines. Thus regions with relatively low infant mortality rate (IMR) (<20) are likely to perceive the need for pediatric heart centers first.[17] It may be necessary to prioritize these regions for the development of new pediatric heart programs. In regions with high IMR, a strong focus pediatric heart care may amount to misplaced public health priorities. The most important element in building pediatric heart programs is human resources. New centers will need to be manned by trained pediatric cardiac surgeons, pediatric cardiologists, anesthesiologists, intensivists, nurses, and perfusion technologists.
It is vital to develop select centers as academic centers of excellence with dedicated training programs and research facilities. These centers are vital to enable local capacity building. Traditionally, the responsibility of providing training has been shouldered by government and selected charitable institutions. In the few government academic medical institutions in India that take care of children with heart disease and regularly perform infant and newborn heart surgery, pediatric cardiac surgery, and pediatric cardiology still largely function as a subsidiary of the respective adult cardiac service. This arrangement has severely curtailed the growth of the specialty and has come in the way of the establishment of specialized training programs that is needed for the care of children with heart disease. A handful of institutions outside the government sector have initiated training programs in pediatric cardiology. Training opportunities for pediatric cardiac surgeons are extremely limited, and there are no dedicated training programs in pediatric cardiac intensive care.
The following action items toward building capacity in pediatric heart care deserve serious consideration: 1. There is a need to bring together key stakeholders
that should include representatives of the Pediatric Cardiac Society of India, Medical Council of India and National Board of Examinations, the Ministry of Health including those involved in the RBSK initiative to a common forum and discuss the specific modalities towards building capacity in pediatric heart care in India. 2. Dedicated Departments of Pediatric Cardiology and Pediatric Cardiac Surgery need to be established in leading academic medical institutions of the country in the government sector (such as All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Research and Education, Sree Chithra Thirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology, Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiology, and
179

selected medical colleges and flagship hospitals of the Ministry of Health). Advanced training programs, specifically, Doctor of Medicine (DM) and Master of Chirurgical (Mch) programs in pediatric cardiology and pediatric cardiac surgery respectively should be established in these institutions. 3. Over the next several years there should be a plan to initiate pediatric heart programs in more and more medical colleges in India in a carefully planned fashion with a view to build substantial capacity for pediatric heart care in the country. 4. A mechanism should be created to encourage and nurture private and charitable institutions with pediatric heart programs to develop training programs for specific categories of physicians, nursing, and allied professional streams.
Pragmatic models for universal coverage
We recently studied the microeconomics of congenital heart surgery in India at the Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences in Cochin, Kerala. Baseline and first follow-up data of 644 consecutive children admitted for CHD surgery was collected prospectively from parents through questionnaires using a semi-structured interview schedule. Most families belonged to the upper middle (43.0%) and lower middle (35.7%) socioeconomic class. Only 3.9% of families had some form of health insurance. The median expense for the admission and surgery was INR 201898 (interquartile range [IQR]: 163287-266139), which was 0.93 (IQR: 0.52-1.49) times the annual family income. Median loss of man-days was 35 (IQR: 24-50), and job-days was 15 (IQR: 11-24). Surgical risk category and hospital stay duration significantly predicted higher costs. One in two families reported overwhelming to high financial stress during admission period for surgery. Approximately, half of the families borrowed money during the follow-up period after surgery. It is likely that the poorest were not adequately represented in this study.[18]
These results clearly suggest that universal coverage for pediatric heart needs to be supported by public insurance schemes. Private institutions will need to partner with the government in providing for UHC in a manner quite similar to the Aarogyasri model. The total costs for pediatric heart care will be substantial, and it is not clear how the government will generate the necessary resources? It is not entirely clear what the annual fund requirement will have to be. If the government undertakes to pay (as was promised by the minister of health in the RBSK document), will this be sustainable? In regions where there are serious deficiencies in basic maternal and child health services, can substantial resource allocation for expensive infant heart surgery be justified?
There is another key consideration. It is simply not realistic and sustainable for UHC to cover all forms
180

of pediatric heart disease. This is especially true for congenital defects. It needs to be understood by all stakeholders that CHD includes an extremely diverse group of conditions. Some of these require no treatment, some can be fixed through a single operation, some require many operations, and many have lifelong issues after the "correction." The extreme diversity in resource utilization makes it hard to come up with a simplified recommendation. For example, the 3-stage surgery for the hypoplastic left heart with considerable long-term uncertainty can consume a lot of resources whereas a simple cath laboratory procedure can a large duct for good. Both these are life-saving procedures, but there are major differences in the "return on investment."
The likelihood of unanticipated costs is especially high after pediatric heart surgery. Intensive care is often longer than expected, and this uncertainty will need to be integrated into the model used to calculate reimbursement for procedures.
It is also necessary to recognize that availability of public insurance with a fixed reimbursement policy for hospitals may inappropriately shift the focus towards the simple and relatively benign heart defects. Hospitals may prefer to do more of restrictive patent arterial ducts, relatively small or moderate atrial septal defects and restrictive perimembranous ventricular septal defects (VSDs). Some of these defects would often be left alone in the absence of public insurance. In any case, they would not be a priority over a relatively expensive situation such as an infant with a large VSD and pneumonia who stands to gain the most from early corrective surgery.
Given these considerations, how should UHC for CHD be prioritized? The framework for prioritizing treatment is likely to be complex and will involve a number of considerations. Two fundamental considerations would dictate how CHD care should be prioritized. Firstly, how much is the defect likely to impact the child's survival and well-being? Secondly, what is the likely long-term outcome after initial correction of the defect? Most would agree that major CHDs that can be corrected through a single operation or catheter procedure should receive a higher priority over conditions requiring multiple operations [Figure 2]. Staged single ventricle palliations with the uncertain long-term outcome (such as heterotaxy and hypoplastic left heart syndrome) should receive the lowest priority. Figure 2 is an attempt to classify congenital heart operations based on expected long-term outcomes. For catheter interventions, procedures that do not have wide acceptance such as the closure of the membranous VSD or a "silent" patent ductus arteriosus should perhaps receive lower priority. Pulmonary hypertension is a common association and has a powerful impact on outcomes. It poses a difficult dilemma in borderline situations. It can be argued that significant elevation of pulmonary vascular

Figure 2: A simplified classification of congenital heart operations based on expected long-term outcomes. ALCAPA: Anomalous left coronary artery from pulmonary artery, ASD: Atrial septal defect, BT shunt: Blalock-Taussig shunt, TOF: Tetralogy of Fallot, VSD: Ventricular septal defect

resistance should lower the priority for funding of the procedure because of uncertainties in long-term outcome.
Many other considerations are worth deliberating on. They include presence or absence of genetic conditions that will strongly impact the neurodevelopmental outcome. Co-morbidities such as blood stream sepsis, lung infection, prematurity, congenital defects involving other organ systems are all quite common in children with CHD. They have a significant impact on surgical and neurodevelopmental outcomes and are quite difficult to factor in.
A model for prioritizing pediatric cardiac care for UHC can be perhaps be developed through careful consultation with a wide range of stakeholders that should include pediatric cardiologists, pediatric heart surgeons, general pediatricians, policy planners, patients and their families. Published and tested risk stratifications systems such as the Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-I, Aristotle (http://www.aristotleinstitute.org/aboutScore. asp) and the STAT Mortality Categories may also need to be integrated into the model. It may be necessary to develop dedicated software given a large number of interrelated variables.[19-21]
Identifying and enlisting centers Given the sensitivity of outcomes to the quality of care, it is vital that pediatric heart centers seeking to participate
Annals of Pediatric Cardiology 2015 Vol 8 Issue 3

in UHC are carefully selected to ensure that minimum standards are met. Ideally, outcomes after surgery and catheter interventions in each institution should be made available in the public domain. Shared registries between all centers in the country will allow for comparison of results with the benchmarking with national average and results from North America and Europe.[22] It will also enable determination of coverage region-wise and for the country as a whole.
Our responsibilities as pediatric cardiac professionals
Pediatric heart professionals in India today are in a unique position to contribute to the development of the specific disciplines that constitute pediatric heart care. While we are all perhaps motivated to deliver the very best for the children who reach us, we should all perhaps consider improving access for the average child with heart disease in the region we seek to serve as an equally important goal.
Should we not look to try and deliver care in such a way that we benefit the largest possible proportion of patients in the region? Do we actually go out there into the community and ask some uncomfortable questions about why children with heart disease are not getting the care they should be getting?
The huge gulf between resources and disease burden has not surfaced in our collective consciousness
181

Kumar: Universal coverage for pediatric heart care
and clearly does not figure enough in our academic deliberations.
We expect the government (policy makers) to figure out ways to address the question of improving access to care to bridge the gulf and perhaps do not perceive it as our responsibility. However, we are in a position to influence policy. This requires collective and responsible advocacy from the members of the Pediatric Cardiac Society of India (PCSI). The time is right for the PCSI to draft an advocacy statement for the government with the specific view to improving access for children with heart disease through a system of universal health coverage.
CONCLUSIONS
Pediatric cardiac care in India has advanced impressively in terms of quality of care in selected institutions and the number of new centers that have the capability for the infant and newborn heart surgery. However, the collective capacity for pediatric heart care in the country falls woefully short of the overall national requirements, and the existing centers are not distributed in accordance with regional needs. Given the current challenges, universal coverage for children with heart disease in India may appear like a distant dream. Nonetheless, this may be the most worthwhile dream to pursue for the pediatric cardiac fraternity. We can only claim to have truly progressed when the average child born in India with heart disease has access to comprehensive pediatric cardiac care.

ABSTRACT: The author probes in this study the maternity or obsterics and gynaecology in

Ancient Indian medicine by interpreting various classical texts in Ayurveda, Sociology and

Religion.

Maternity or motherhood, a symbol of selfless love, sacrifice and dedication, a natural instinct of females refers in medicine to the subject dealing with conception, it's maintenance, nourishment and delivery. In ancient Indian medicine it is dealt under Kaumarbhrtya one of the eight specialties, the child being pivot entire physiopathologies specific for woman have revolved around it.
Though maternity or obstetrics and gynaecology are closely inter-related, and often described together, however, the present paper limits itself to the field of maternity only.
According to India philosophy reproduction is not merely a physiological function, rather it is a social obligation to be fulfilled by the couple, religious ritual to be observed during grhasthasrama. Naturally the practice of this branch is closely inter-woven with social and religious outcome, and so the books of sociology and religion are flooded with the matter related to this branch. Thus, it is imperative to see the books of related subjects.

VI Chapter of Brahadaranyaka Upanisad1, deals with various exercises during coitus either to have or not to have conception, specific diet etc. during pregnancy according to desired qualities of offspring; embryology of Garbhopanisad2; qualifications of girl and man, and method to know future of girl to be married in Aswalayana3 and Apastambha grhya4 sutras; classification of age of girl in Vaikhanasa Upanisad5 and Parasara smrti6; vaidika-garbha-baijika and garbhika mantras as well as rtu sangamana, niseka or caturthi, garbhadhana, pumsawana, gartharaksana or anawalobhana, pumsawana, gartharaksana or anawalobhana, simantonnayana and sosyanti or ksipraprasuwan etc. home/ karma / sanskaras are ample evidence regarding availability of subject in these classics.
Good number of drugs or recipes not mentioned in ayurvedic classics are also found in these books such as -
The woman during pregnancy exhibits such a distinct features that even poets could not refrain themselves from describing these.
- Can not tolerate dis-obedience even in light mood.

Pages 192 - 202

- Wishes to bath from the water of all four seas
- Prefers to see her face in shining sword instead of stone studded mirrors.

- Feels pleasure in the twang of bowstring rather than well played Vina.
- Likes the sight of caged lions.

Atharvaveda, the fountain source of ayurveda, has very rich treasure of the subject. In this Veda reference of vessels for menstruation and menorrhagia (AV.I / 17 / 1 to 4), rtukala (AV. III / 20 / 1, VI/139/5, VIII/9/10), woman as field and man in possession of seed for conception (AV. XIV / 2/14), visible and invisible sukra (AV. XIV/1/10); importance of healthy condition of woman for achieving conception (AV.XVIII/3/57), garbhadhana (AV. V/25 Complete), pumsawana (AV. VI/II complete), induction of abortion (AV. V/17/7), preterm deliveries (AV. VI/17), complete abortion and intra - uterine death specially due to infection (AV. II/25/3; AV. III/6/9 and 22 etc.), specific protection of pregnant woman (AV. XIV/2/7); mechanism and management including surgery for

labour (AV. I/II complete specially 1,3, to 5), are ample evidences.
It is not possible to enumerate all these, but in short the process of labour described in this Veda, is as follows ; (A) "At this birth, O Pusan, let Aryaman (as) efficient (Vedhan) invoker utter vasat for thee, let the woman rightly engendered be relaxed, let her joints go apart in order to birth". (Whitney).
Sayanacarya has explained it in a verse for delivery of alive child without pain, with the relaxation of ligaments of joints likely to obstruct the labour7. During pregnancy specially delivery due to action or relaxine hormone the ligaments of joints specially pelvic ligaments are relaxed, which helps in

Pages 192 - 202

easy delivery, probably this verse refers to that:
(B) "Let Pusan (7) unclose (her or it) we make the yoni go apart, do thou Susana loosen do thou Biskala, let go". (Whitney).
According to Sayanacarya8 this verse refers to initial removal to overing of fetus (artificial rupture of membrane), then dialatation of yoni (ironing a process done to help in delivery). Biskali or sutimarut (apan vayu) propels the fetus with its face as downwards (during second stage internal rotation of fetal head occurs and with exaggerated flexion face become much downwards).
Susa or Susani the accoucheuse goddesses are symbolic referring to the lady helping the parturient woman. In this verse assistance given to the delivering woman as well as mechanism of labour is described9 (C) "I split apart thy urinator, apart the yoni apart the (two) groins, apart both the mother and child, apart the boy from the after birth, let the after birth descent" (Whitney).
The verse refers to some surgical interference and artificial rupture of membranes to deliver the child and then expulsion of placenta10.
It appears that during the period of this Veda abortions were induced, but were not socially accepted thus, the person resorting to this procedure was punished by wife of brahmana11.
Preceding description shows the dexterity and command of knowledge hidden in this Veda.
Amongst available ayurvedic classics of ancient period, in Caraka, Samhita, considered to be the oldest book, physiology

of menstruation, fertilization descend of garbha, gartha (zygote, embryo, fetus) dauhrda, pumsawana karma, clinical feature of pregnant woman, antenatal care, preinciples of treatment of the diseases afflicting the pregnant woman, udavarta of a pregnant woman, abortions, upavistaka - upasuska - bhuta - hrta - garbha etc. fetal disorders, teratological abnormalities, accouchement ward, labour, puerperium etc. have been described.
In Susruta Samhita, the book on surgery, comparatively detailed anatomy of female reproductive system, consent of guardian and other intricate details of obstructed labour are described. Besides this other matter related to the subject is also added such as -
1. Stri-sukra, physical changes preceding menarche, formation of artava also along with sukra from rasa is one month, formation and function of raja, age of menarche and menopause, accumulation of blood within uterine vessles for whole month in menstrual cycle; effects of use of mascara, etc. and coitus during menstruation effect of seeing husband on fourth day of menstruation and rtu-kala.
2. Functions of mahabhutas in development of embryo, formation of placenta, effect of diet of mother on body complexion of fetus, development of colour of eyes, descend of two jiwas in twin pregnancy, birth of bone-less fetus, cause of absence of cry, micturition and defecation by fetus.
3. Cause of breast changes during pregnancy, clinical features of twin pregnancy, use of meat soup in fourth, goksuru in sixth and basti in eighth month of pregnancy and hypermesis gravidarum.

Pages 192 - 202

4. Definition of garbha-srava ad garbhapata, treatment of various complications of abortion, month-wise treatment of abortions, clinical features of garbhavrddhi and garbha-ksaya, advise for termination of pregnancy.
5. Construction of accouchment room with different woods according to caste of woman, causes of labour, treatment of garbha-sanga, manual removal of placenta and obstructed labour.
6. Period of puerperium, care of puerperal woman on the basis of her place of living, makkalla sula, rakta - vidradhi.
Omission of description of liquor amni by Susruta the surgeon of such high repute is difficult to explain.
Later authors i.e Vagbhata Kasyapa etc. have also advanced the knowledge of this speciality which can be summarized as following:
Contributions of Astanga - Samgraha:
1) Presence of raja or sonata from early childhood, amount of raja.
2) Explanation of cause of birth of female or male child by coitus done on odd or even days respectively.
3) Rajasika and tamasika features of fetus, effect of place of living, season, profession and colour of sukra on the body complexion of progency, presence of dauhrda in fortyfive days, roma - raji.
4) Effect on the fetus of the diet capable of vitiating vata etc. dosas by pregnant woman, method of giving basti to a pregnant woman.

5) Comparatively detailed description of abortion etc. clinical features and treatment of upavistaka and upsuska associated with vitiation of vata etc. dosas and vatodara.
6) Use of skin the bed for labour, bath to a puerperal woman, treatment of yoni bhrmsa of a puerperal woman, raksa karma on sixth night after delivery.
Astanga Hrdaya has described almost entire subject given by Astanga Samgraha albeit in a summarized form except for the mention of viskambhamudha garbha instead of its different presentations / positions.
Contributions of Kasyapa Samhita
Variations in duration of rtu-kala in different castes, principles of treatment of diseases afflicting the woman in different months of pregnancy, treatment of vomiting during pregnancy on the basis of dominating dosa, detailed treatment of diseases of pregnant woman, effect of smoking etc. given to a pregnant woman suffering from fever, mention of various menstrual disorders, abortions, intra - uterine and neonatal deaths etc. under the heading of Jataharini, varanabandha, effect of avies (labour pains) on labour, colour of `Show' according to sex of the fetus, cause of reappearance of menstruation after delivery, comparatively detailed management of puerperium on the basis of place of living and also sex of born child, puerperal disorders and their elaborate treatment are it's contributions.
Contribution of Madhava Nidana:
Sutika rogas are enumerated in this book.
Contributions of Harita Samhita

Classification of epochs of woman's life in bala and mugdha etc., acceptance of retas as different from sukra, classification of mudha garbha on the basis of dosas i.e. vataja etc., monthwise treatment of excessive quivering of fetus.
Later authors of this period have almost followed the foot -steps of their predecessors. Ubhaya - trimsaka - yantra, for help in delivery is described in Vrnda - madhava12 dreams indicating birth of male child, clinical features during antenatal period indicating still - birth, use of milk with specific single drug in different months of pregnancy, month - wise treatment of pain during pregnancy, vesico - vaginal fistula due to injury during delivery of obstructed labour along with it's treatment, recipes for the treatment of vaginal ulcer and laxity of vaginal canal after delivery in Yogaratna - samuccaya13, local contraceptives and abortificients in Rajamartanda14 and treatment of abdominal laxity after delivery in Vangasena15 can specifically be considered as contributions of these books. Besides this a good number of recipes have been added.
It is clear from preceding description that there has been a continuous progress, albeit slow, in advancement of knowledge of the subject.
It is not possible to discuss the whole subject in one paper, and so here only three aspects will be dealt i.e. preventive obstetrics or the measures described to prevent maternal / fetal complication; abnormal labour including obstetric surgery and contraceptives which are now - a - days considered as a part of post - natal management.
Preventive obstetrics can be discussed under following headings:

1. Physical fitness and proper age for marriage.
2. Hygiene and asepsis.
3. High spirit or good psychological status of woman during various stages of reproduction.
4. Pathya or congenial diet.
(1) Physical fitness and proper age for marriage:
In bala, vrdda, hungry, thirsty woman, suffering from chronic diseases, the impregnation is contra - indicated16. Fit age of conception is said to be sixteen years17 which is also accepted as best age for pregnancy from purely obstetrical point of view. Young girl due to physical and psychological immaturity and old lady due to physical and psychological decline will not be able to nurture the child properly. It is proved beyond doubt that the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities. Down's syndrome, premature labour, etc. is more in the woman conceiving after the age of thirty five years specially for the first time. Chronically ill woman can infect her child or be a cause of premature labour and intrauterine growth retardation leading to various physical and psychological abnormalities.
(2) Hygiene and asepsis:
This can be discussed under the following sub - headings -
(a) Specific mode of life during menstruation.

Pages 192 - 202

(b) Isolation of parturient woman in accouchement ward and maintenance of asepsis.
(c) Proper management during puerperium.
(d) Cleaning of surgeon's hand to deliver the fetus.
(a) Specific mode of life during menstruation:
The woman was to be isolated, bath, unction, mascara18 etc. were contra indicated.
Though scientific value of various restrictions may be questioned, but these restrictions carry a hidden message that since, during menstruation natural defence of the reproductive system is lost and as the woman is more vulnerable to contact infection specially if she bathes in pool, river etc. or have coitus, she is advised to lead a segregated life.
(b) Isolation of parturient woman in accouchement ward and maintenance of asepsis:
Well protected, lighted, ventilated, comfortable in all the seasons, accouchement ward equipped with raksoghna and other drugs and instruments needed during delivery was constructed with woods at a distant place for normal dwelling accommodation. The expectant woman lived in this ward from ninth month. Entry in this room was restricted. This room was well fumigated, and constant burning fire was kept there.
All these measures maintain aseptic conditions in the ward. Stay of woman for few weeks preceding delivery, work as

quarantine, as she is also separated, lest she catches infection19.

(c) Proper pueperium:

management

during

Hot water bath at least twice a day was essential20. Specific raksoghna measures were prrescribed21.

The woman was made to sit over a chair
covered with leather bag filled with hot bala-taila22. This is to prevent any contact
of infection.

(d) Proper cleaning of surgeon's hands to deliver fetus etc.

The advise was, that nails of the surgeon's hands should be properly out23 and cleaned
because these may carry infection.

(3) Good Psychological status of woman:

Psychological well being of woman was given very high importance. From fourth day of menstruation, when she is preparing herself to meet her husband, then up to the puerperium, she is to remain happy in high spirit. Desires or other features of dauhrda indicate character of offspring, such as, if the woman desires to see a king, she will have a son of high fortune etc24. Psychological environment such as during putrestiyajana influences psychosomatic development of offspring. Unhappy mood etc. can cause various abnormalities such as -

4. Pathya or Congenial diet:
During every stage of life whether it is physiological or pathological a regulated dietetic regimen has been very much emphasized, and naturally various stages of reproductive function are also not omitted. Sailent features of the dietetic regimen are as under:
(a) During menstruation - during menstruation the woman is advised to take havisya30 (cooked sali rice with ghrta or barley prepared with milk) or yawaka31 (edible prepared with barley). Yawa is lekhana, beneficial for vrana (ulcers), increase the excretion of flatus and faeces, suppresses pitta and kapha. These properties may help in proper discharges of endometrium and menstrual blood, then it's regeneration etc.

(b) During Ritu Kala - Before conjugation but during rtu kala the women should consume oil and masa etc., 32 because they increase pitta and thereby increase artava which is an essential female component for conception.
(c) Prior to conception - Colour of the articles to be taken in diet should be identical to the complexion desired for offspring, 33 is the advise of Caraka and Kasyapa referred in Putresti yajna.
(d) Antenatal period - Exhaustive account of `to eat' or `not to eat' for pregnant woman is prescribed in ayurvedic classics. She is advised to take mainly butter, milk, ghrta, liquid, sweet and palatable diet medicated with appetizing drugs34. Excessive heavy, hot and pungent articles and intoxicants like wine etc., left over and putrified articles are contra-indicated, because these can cause abortion or intra uterine death of the fetus35.
Specific dietetic regimen for different gestational months is also prescribed. In first month use of milk or ghrta medicated with saliparni and palasa and water boiled in pot made of silver or gold36, in second month milk treated with drugs of madhura groups37, in fourth month meat soup and in sixth month ghrta medicated with goksura38 deserve special mention. For first three months the woman often has nausea, vomiting etc. thus use of liquid, sweet and cold things will prevent vomiting and malnutrition. From fourth month muscular tissue of fetus starts developing, requiring more protein and use of meat soup will be helpful in maintaining maternal and fetal growth. In third, trimester water accumulation and urinary stasis is common problem

Pages 192 - 202

and regular use of goksuru will prevent this complication.

Dauhrda is a special description of ayurveda which denotes vicarious desires of the pregnant woman. Actually these indicate specific deficiency, and their supplementation helps in maintenance of proper maternal and fetal development.

(e) During normal puerperium - After delivery when the woman feels appetite medicated fats or medicated jaggery water should be given and once these are digested, medicated yawagu mixed with milk and ghrta should be given. This should be followed by use of meat soup and light diet39 etc. After delivery due to sudden increase in the intra abdominal space for the bowels some digestive upset does come, and above mentioned diet will take care of digestive capacity as well as caloric requirement of the body.

(f) During abnormal puerperium - For first three days powders, decoctions or pastes of drugs mixed with fat should be given. This helps in excretion of dosas, relieves stiffness and pain of flanks and vagina. This should be followed by fats in the morning and asawa or aristas in the evening for 7 days. For next ten days milk medicated with drugs capable of suppressing vata, and for another ten days meat soup, should be given. After this one month, light and congenial diet in little quantity should be given for further 3 months40.

Abnormalities of Labour:

Now I shall discuss sailent features of

abnormalities of labour.

These

abnormalities can be discussed under following headings:
a) Premature labour
b) Postmature labour
c) Ante-partum haemorrhage
d) Prolong labour
e) Obstructed labour.
(a) Premature labour : Contra-indication of coitus on third day of menstruation as the child conceived may delivery abnormally41, unstability of ojas in 8th month42, difference in the management of kala-prasuta (timely delivered woman) and akala-prasuta (delivered in abnormal period)43 are ample evidence of premature labour. Harita has specially mentioned that the child propelled by vayu thus delivered prematurally may be weak44. Arunadutta says that though the child born in seventh month does survive but is weak and terms it as akala-prasava45. In Madhukosa commentary, delivery in seventh month is termed as viprasava46.
(b) Post mature labour: Intra - uterine stay of fetus after 10th or 12th month is said to be abnormal47 which is caused due to constrction of exit passage or/yoni by vayu48. According to Susruta lina - garbha also it is a condition of prolong intra-uterine stay due to spasm of exit passage49. All these are ample evidences of post maturity.
(c) Antepartum haemorrhage: In the definition of obstructed labour it is mentioned that vitiated apana vayu troubles or kills the young fetus by bleeding per vaginum which refers to revealed antepartum haemorrhage50.

Pages 192 - 202

Makkalla of aparajata or pregnant woman is explained by Dalhana that displaced fetus obstructs the passage of blood discharged in the uterus. This blood accumulated inside the uterus and metabolized causes very severe pain which refers to concealed antepartum haemorrhage51.
(d) Prolong labour: Treatment of garbhasanga, delay or arrest to the progress of labour refer to prolong labour52.

(e) Obstructed labour: Obstruction to the labour could be due to fault in passage, passenger and power.
i) Fault in the passage - Abnormalities of soft passages i.e. uterus, cervix or perineum and bony pelvis can cause obstruction to the labour and later on even rupture of uterus53. These conditions have been described in following way :

Actual description

Abnormality of passage

1. Garbha Kosa apannata54

Cogenital or acquired abnormalities of uterus i.e. Uterus arcuatus, didelphys and fibroid uterus etc.

2. Yoni samvrti or yoni-samvarana55

Cervical dystocia or non-dilatation of cervix.

3. Bhaga sankoca due to skyness56

Psychogenic perineal rigidity.

4. Yoni bhramsa57

Cervical prolapse.

5. Asamyk apatyapatha or anirasyamina58 Abnormalities of bony pelvis.

ii) Fault in the Passenger - The passenger
or fetus may have abnormality of its size i.e. over size59, or presentation and position60.

surgical interference to delivery fetus or placenta. All these procedures are described in classics.

iii) Fault in the power - Arrest in the progress of labour due to abnormality of apana vayu61, slow movement of fetus62 garbha sanga63 treatment in the failure of descent of fetus etc.64 hint towards ineffectual uterine action, while stony hardness of abdomen, excessive pain without avies65 or labour pain and makalla66 refer to hypertonocity of uterus. Cervical dystocia is already discussed.
Obstetric Surgery:
Obstetric surgery refers to evacuation of uterus in incomplete abortion, induction of abortion and labour, manipulations or

a) Evacuation of uterus in incomplete abortion: The woman should be treated with tiksna drugs or measures (curettage) till the sama garbha is completed expelled because if any portion is left, it troubles her67.
b) Induction of abortion - Susruta has included use of garbhasatana (abortifient) drugs as cause of abortion and obstructed labour. This shows that drugs were used to terminate pregnancy68. Termination of pregnancy is also indicated if the woman is unable to withstand trouble69 or else if upvistake

Pages 192 - 202

and upasuska garbha do not grow / develop inspite of best treatment70.
c) Induction of labour - In cases of postmaturity indications to induce labour are available71.
d) Surgery to deliver obstructed fetus - Intricate details of manipulation or surgery for delivering obstructed fetus is given.
Consent of guardian was precondition for any interference in delivery72. This indicates high standard of medical ethics. Manipulation / surgery were to be done by wise person73 who has done several such operations74, on the patient who is kept empty stomach75 in supine position with flexed thighs and elevated hips76 (lithotomy position). Initially by doing cephalic or podalic bimanual version delivery was attempted, after death of the fetus and failure by manual extraction various destructive operations were done77. Laparotomy was practiced to extract alive fetus after accidental death of woman78. Placenta was delivered with the help of drugs, manipulations, basti and in the event of failure of all these by manual extraction79.
Contraception:
Except references of historical importance in Atharvaveda80, and Brhadaranyaka Upanisad81 unequivocal description of contraceptive drugs/methods of practical utility is lacking up to 11th century; however, indirect reference for abstinence, safe period, incomplete coitus are available. From 11th century onwards contraceptive abortificient drugs were used.
(a) Abstinence: Coitus was done to get the child, naturally it can be understood that

when desired number is achieved, abstinence should be practiced.

(b) Safe period: Rtu kala is described as the period of optimum fertilization, once rtu kala is over yoni of the woman gets constricted thus does not permit the entry of sukra in its inner component82. Rtu kala refers to proliferative phase including ovulation. After ovulation due to effect of progesterone hormone cervical mucus becomes hostile to sperm penetration, which is indicated in above description. If one does not want a child one should have coitus after rtu kala which is referred as safe period.

(c) Incomplete coitus: During coitus, lateral or hump back position of woman is contra-indicated, because in these positions woman does not conceive83. In these positions probably coitus becomes a type of incomplete coitus due to incomplete penetration of penis or in other words this refers to incomplete coitus.

(d) Contraceptive drugs: In Yogaratnasamuccaya84 three and in Cakradutta85

two oral recipes are described for

puspanasa or rajo-harana (causing

anovulation

or

amenorrhoea)

respectively. Out of two recipes of

Cakradutta one has been described as

oral

contraceptive

in

Bhaisajyaratnawali86 the book of

twentieth century, on the logic that once

raja is finished the questions of

conception does not arise. With this

analogy all the recipes prescribed for

puspa or rajonasa can be considered as

oral contraceptives.

Unequivocal

description of two receipes to be used

per Vaginal and one to be tied in waist is seen in Rajamartanda87.

Pages 192 - 202

Preceding description clearly shows that good treasure of knowledge related to maternity is available in the books of ancient Indian medicine.

Keywords: Masticatory preference Hemispheric dominancy Food texture Hand-chew preference Chewing laterality

Abstract Introduction: Humans manifest a behavioral inclination towards more utility of one side of the body, in relation with the dominant hemisphere of the brain. The current investigation assessed handedness together with chewing preference which have not been evaluated in various food textures before. Methods: Nineteen young and healthy volunteers chewed hard (walnut) and soft (cake) foods, during surface electromyography recording from masseter muscles. The side of the first and all chews in the two food types were determined and compared with the side of the dominant hand. Results: Results indicated the two lateralities in the same side considerably (60%-70%), implying the solidarity in the control of the dominant hemisphere of the brain. The unilaterality was more prominent in the assessment of all chews in hard food, with higher statistical agreement and correlation. Conclusion: Thereupon masticatory preference is found with probable origins in the dominant hemisphere of the brain.

Introduction The definition about laterality for the related researches has been propounded as "behavioral manifestations of the cerebral dominance in which there is a preferential use and superior functioning of either the left or the right side, as in the preferred use of right hand or right foot" (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2007). During decades, different kinds of lateralities, including handedness, footedness, eyedness, and earedness have been investigated which could guide towards recognizing the procedures of cerebral controlling.1-5 Moreover, there are some disorders related to the laterality, sometimes in

need of interference.6,7 Chewing side preference, a type of laterality, has been
introduced and discussed mainly in dentistry literature;8-12 and a few authors have investigated the cerebral aspects of this laterality. This motif is under research worldwide, and there are inconsistencies in the methods and results, relating the chewing laterality to the developmental aspects, as well as age,13-16 or dental parameters such as complete denture-wearing, occlusal contact, articular especially temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction, and so on; whether such associations being demonstrated or refused.12,17-25 Pain was also assessed, however no relation

with chewing side preference was seen.26 There are reports about the masticatory laterality and other lateralities (e.g., handedness, footedness), bringing about controversial results. Martinez-Gomis et al concluded that masticatory preference in dentate subjects is related to bite force and occlusal contact area but not to handedness.18 But Nissan et al claimed that "chewing side preference correlated with other tested hemispherical literalities".22 A classic study in 1987 also claimed chewing preference is correlated with other lateral preferences.27 Serel Arslan et al reported similar results in 2017.28 Another study in 2012 reported that various lateralities do not show any strong correlation with chewing side preference.25 Overall, challengingly, it is still unanswered whether or not chewing and handedness are similar?29 The current investigation studied this question from novel points, using EMG recording as a more objective and determining tool, assessing first chews and all chews by a hard food and a soft food in order to implement a comprehensive and efficient method for evaluating chewing side preference; then analyzing its relation with handedness as the outstanding manifestation of the dominant hemisphere.
Materials and Methods Nineteen young and healthy volunteers were recruited. They chewed hard (walnut) and soft (cake) foods, and surface electromyography was recorded from their masseter muscles. An example EMG recording is shown in Fig. 1. The side of the first and all chews in the two food types were determined and compared with the side of the dominant hand by analyses for correlations and agreements. Details of the methods are presented in the supplementary.
From the 19 participants, 73.7% (n=14) were right handed and 26.3% (n=5) were left handed (Fig. 2). The investigators of the current study tried to include more left handed subjects to the study to facilitate the analyses.
In order to assess the similarity of chewing of left handed participants and right handed participants, as well as the similarity of the experiments, the distribution of chewing velocity, number of chews, and time of mastication was assessed in both right handed and left handed subjects.
Results and Discussion Results showed no statistical differences between the two groups (P > 0.1, Table 1). Results also showed no correlation of the side of handedness with gender and age (P = 0.21, 0.64, respectively).
The rate of similar sides in the two lateralities was more than 50% in all four occurrences that we determined for masticatory preference in the two groups of left and right handed subjects except once. When strong masticatory preference was considered, this similarity was 40% or more.

The P values of the correlations and the levels of agreements are shown in Table 2.
The results of this study indicated that more than half of the individuals have the two lateralities of chewing side preference and handedness in the same side. When the laterality was assessed by all chewing cycles, the obtained unilaterality was about 70%. Therefore it can be

concluded, regarding these results, that few of our subjects have these two lateralities cross-sided. The reason for such unilaterality may be explained by the interference of the handedness: because the food is carried with the dominant hand, thus primary chews are done in the same dominant side. But as we see the unilaterality is more considerable in assessing all chews not in primary chews, and there should be independent pathways or mechanisms for chewing preference, much more than such simple interferences.
As reported by other authors, most of the individuals preferred to chew by the right side,16, 18, 30 and we previously reported highly significant masticatory preference towards the right side (P<0.001). Furthermore, nearly one third of the subjects had all four occurrences of chewing preference on the right side and no one had four occurrences on the left.31 We should also consider that more than 90% of the people have their right hand as dominant, with a little lower percentage of right dominancy in other lateralities such as footedness, eyedness, and so forth.3, 32-39 Moreover, medical physiology text claims that almost 95% of individuals show the left angular gyrus and temporal lobe as dominant. Furthermore, "the motor areas for controlling hands are also dominant in the left side of the brain in about 9 out of 10 persons, thus causing right-handedness in most people".40 Therefore, it seems that the laterality and dominance as well as the masticatory preference tend to be on the left brain hemisphere and the contralateral right side of the body, and this brings about the role of brain in determining chewing side preference, although it is difficult to be proved completely.
Unilaterality may represent the attempt of the brain to direct all lateralities to the same side, the side under the control of the dominant hemisphere. An important consequence of unilaterality is facilitation of the ordinary daily activities, for example eating. Similarly, the aim of

hemispheric dominancy has been explained as "direction of mind's attention to the better developed regions for learning, resulting in the increase of rate of learning in the cerebral hemisphere that gains the first start".40 Fig. 2 shows that this unilaterality is more prominent in right handed subjects, and a considerable percent of left handed subjects have their chewing preference on the right side. It should be reminded that left side of the brain is dominant for many left handed subjects as well. Actually, in order to discuss the role of dominant hemisphere precisely in this regard, an investigation should recruit numerous left handed subjects with their dominant hemisphere on the right side (proved by functional magnetic resonance imaging- fMRI- or advanced methods), which are scarce, as much as less than 5% of the population.
Unilaterality of different dimensions is called unilateral cerebral dominancy, but in 20% of people there is mixed or cross dominancy/laterality, meaning that at least two lateralities are on the opposite side (usually hand opposite foot or eye).41 Cross dominancy may have some advantages in activities such as playing baseball,42 but it has been reported to have relations with physical, mental, or emotional dysfunctions or schizophrenic personalities.6, 41 Cross dominancy could be considered an abnormality which would be relieved by some interventions.41
Food texture has been demonstrated to influence masticatory pattern, and this may be a cortical event as well, reducing or increasing the mentioned interaction of hand-chew preference. If so, based upon the results of the current study, hard texture increases this interaction. This brings about the interesting subject of brain areas involved in food texture perception and the resultant effects. Perception of food texture include sensory modalities (e.g., vision, taste) and psychological matters43,44 which surely pass cortical areas, thereupon,

Report Highlights
What is the current knowledge?  Laterality is a behavioral inclination towards more utility of one side of the body, probably in relation with hemispheric dominancy.  Laterality in chewing is named masticatory preference and most of the individuals prefer to chew by the right side.
What is new here?  More than half of the individuals have the two lateralities of chewing side preference and handedness in the same side.  When the laterality was assessed by all chewing cycles of the hard food, this obtained unilaterality was about 70%.  Masticatory preference, similar to hand laterality, possesses probable origins in the dominant hemisphere of the brain.
food texture could remarkably be associated with brain cortex. Takahashi et al studied the areas of cortex which are involved in perception of hardness of food, claiming selective activations of multiple cortical areas of the right and left hemispheres, as hardness of a gum changed during mastication.45 It can thus be postulated that the cross relation of hand-chew preference and food texture is probably located in cortex. It should be mentioned that all P values of correlation among the four occurrences of chewing preference and handedness were insignificant, while in the experiment of all chews with the hard food it showed marginal significance.
Chewing frequently with the same side can wear the teeth, masticatory muscles, and tempro-mandibular joint of that side. Therefore, determining the preferred chewing side in dentistry could be beneficent in preparation of dental prosthetics or dentures or in regard to the dental examinations.22, 30 For determining the preferred chewing side as a basic dentistry examination and history, dentists initially can question the dominant hand side, together with observing the side of the first chew, which we have suggested earlier;31 and if they were inconsistent, the latter would be more valid, as a matter of statistical conclusions.
Conclusion We conclude that masticatory preference could be considered similar to hand laterality, with probable origins in the dominant hemisphere of the brain.

Chondroitin sulfate is a major component of the extracellular matrix in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Chondroitin sulfate is upregulated at injury, thus methods to promote neurite extension through chondroitin sulfate-rich matrices and synthetic scaffolds are needed. We describe the use of both chondroitin sulfate and a novel chondroitin sulfate-binding peptide to control the release of nerve growth factor. Interestingly, the novel chondroitin sulfate-binding peptide enhances the controlled release properties of the chondroitin sulfate gels. While introduction of chondroitin sulfate into a scaffold inhibits primary cortical outgrowth, the combination of chondroitin sulfate, chondroitin sulfatebinding peptide and nerve growth factor promotes primary cortical neurite outgrowth in chondroitin sulfate gels.

gels on neurite outgrowth, cortical neu-

LKB1 is a `master' protein kinase implicated in the regulation of metabolism, cell proliferation, cell polarity and tumorigenesis. However, the long-term role of LKB1 in hepatic function is unknown. In the present study, it is shown that hepatic LKB1 plays a key role in liver cellular architecture and metabolism. We report that liver-specific deletion of LKB1 in mice leads to defective canaliculi and bile duct formation, causing impaired bile acid clearance and subsequent accumulation of bile acids in serum and liver. Concomitant with this, it was found that the majority of BSEP (bile salt export pump) was retained in intracellular pools rather than localized to the canalicular membrane in hepatocytes from LLKB1KO (liver-specific Lkb1knockout) mice. Together, these changes resulted in toxic accumulation of bile salts, reduced liver function and failure to

thrive. Additionally, circulating LDL (low-density lipoprotein)cholesterol and non-esterified cholesterol levels were increased in LLKB1KO mice with an associated alteration in red blood cell morphology and development of hyperbilirubinaemia. These results indicate that LKB1 plays a critical role in bile acid homoeostasis and that lack of LKB1 in the liver results in cholestasis. These findings indicate a novel key role for LKB1 in the development of hepatic morphology and membrane targeting of canalicular proteins.

INTRODUCTION
LKB1 encodes an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that was originally identified as a tumour suppressor, as inactivating mutations in LKB1 in humans cause Peutz-Jeghers syndrome [1,2]. More recently, LKB1 has been shown to act upstream of AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) [3-5] and 12 AMPK-related kinases [6]. LKB1 phosphorylates a conserved threonine residue within the T-loop of these kinases, which is essential for their activation [7]. Activation of AMPK by LKB1 under conditions of energy depletion results in the downregulation of energy-consuming pathways and the up-regulation of ATP-producing pathways. Much less is understood regarding the roles of the AMPK-related kinases, although there is evidence to suggest that the MARK [MAP (microtubule-associated protein)-regulating kinase/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase] [8] and BRSK (brain-specific kinase) [9,10] subfamilies play roles in determining cell polarity. Information concerning the physiological function of the remaining AMPK-related kinases is extremely limited [11].
Germline deletion of LKB1 leads to an embryonic-lethal phenotype with mice dying from a variety of vascular and placental defects, demonstrating a key developmental role [12]. Tissue-specific deletion of LKB1 has been investigated in several

mouse models [13-15] with phenotypes affecting various aspects of cell morphology and organ dysfunction. Taken together these findings suggest that LKB1 plays a key role in integrating cell and tissue morphology with metabolic function.
The liver has many metabolic functions including bile production together with key regulatory roles in glucose, lipid and xenobiotic metabolism. Bile is the main vehicle by which the body disposes of excess cholesterol by conversion into bile acids and the route used for the excretion of waste products such as bilirubin, a breakdown product of haem. Because high levels of bile acids can cause tissue damage due to their strong detergent properties, their concentrations are tightly regulated by transcriptional control of many genes in a complex feedback mechanism involving bile acid activation of FXR (farnesoid X receptor) (reviewed in [16]). Following their synthesis in the liver, bile acids are secreted into the bile, stored in the gall bladder and released postprandially into the small intestine, where they play a critical role in the absorption of fat and fat-soluble nutrients. The majority of the bile acids are then returned to the liver via the portal circulation through ASBT (apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter) in the epithelial cells of the small intestine. Completion of the enterohepatic circulation occurs when the bile acids are returned to the liver mainly by transport via NTCP (sodium-taurochloate co-transporting protein). A major feature

of hepatocytes is their marked anatomical polarity, which plays an essential role in their function. For example, the polar nature of hepatocytes allows the efficient vectorial transport of bile acids from the portal blood into the hepatocytes via NTCP and then into the intrahepatic biliary system via BSEP (bile salt export pump). BSEP is a member of the ABC (ATP-binding-cassette) transporter family and is classified as ABCB11 (ABC subfamily B, member 11). BSEP is regulated both transcriptionally and posttranslationally, and mediates canalicular bile formation [17]. In the present study, we show that hepatic LKB1 plays a key role in liver cellular architecture and metabolism. Absence of hepatic LKB1 results in mis-localization of BSEP, bile duct paucity and impairment of postnatal biliary tree formation. LLKB1KO (liverspecific Lkb1-knockout) mice also display impaired bile acid and lipid metabolism, and die within 4 weeks of birth.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Generation of mice lacking hepatic LKB1
Production of mice harbouring Lkb1-floxed alleles has been described previously [14]. These mice were crossed with B6.Cg-Tg (Alb-Cre) 21 Mgn/J transgenic mice harbouring Crerecombinase under the albumin promoter (Jackson Laboratories). All animal studies were performed in accordance with the Animal Scientific Procedures Act. Animals were killed by cervical dislocation, and organs were rapidly removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Western blotting
Proteins were resolved on 4-12 % gradient gels (Novex, Invitrogen), transferred on to PVDF membranes and probed with antibodies as described in the text. Antibodies were detected by ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) (West Dura kit; Pierce).
Antibodies
The sheep anti-LKB1 antibody, raised against residues 24-39 of human LKB1, was generously provided by Professor Dario Alessi (Division of Signal Transduction Therapy, University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland, U.K.). The mouse monoclonal antiLKB1 antibody (Ley37D/G6) and goat anti-radixin antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-LKB1 antiserum [18], rabbit pan-AMPK antibody and sheep anti-AMPK1 and -AMPK2 antibodies [19] were as described previously. The anti-BSEP and -NTCP antibodies were generously provided by Professor Bruno Stieger (Division of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland) [20,21]. The goat anti-(mouse osteopontin) antibody was from R&D Systems, and the anti-CK19 antibody was from Dako (IS615).
Haemocrit measurement
Blood was collected in haemocrit tubes and centrifuged at 3000 g. Packed red cell volume was measured as a ratio of the total blood sample volume.
Immune complex kinase assays
LKB1 or AMPK complexes were immunoprecipitated from soluble liver lysates using antibodies bound to either Protein A- or Protein G-Sepharose. After extensive washing, kinase activity present in the immune complexes was determined as

described previously [3]. AMPK activity was measured by [32P]Pi incorporation into the SAMS peptide (HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR) [22]. LKB1 activity was measured by activation of bacterially expressed AMPK complex (1, 1 and  1), which was subsequently assayed using the SAMS peptide.
Osmotic fragility test
The osmotic fragility test was performed according to the method described by Foller et al. [23].
Transmission electron microscopy
After glutaraldehyde fixation and processing, samples were embedded in araldite. Semi-thin sections of 0.5-1 m were stained with Toluidine Blue in borax. Ultra-thin sections were stained in uranyl acetate followed by Reynold's lead citrate.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Tissue was fixed in formalin/saline and processed in paraffin wax. Routine sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemical staining was carried out on the Dako Autostainer Plus using a diaminobenzidine-based system to identify antibody binding.
Immunofluorescence microscopy
Livers were fixed in paraformaldehyde, and frozen sections were used for staining. Appropriate Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies were used, and DAPI (4 ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole) was used as a nuclear stain.
Liver function tests and metabolite measurements
Serum levels of albumin, ALP (alkaline phosphatase), total cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol and HDL (high-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol, bilirubin and triacylglycerols (triglycerides) were determined by the Mouse Biochemistry Laboratories, Cambridge, U.K. Assays were measured colorimetrically on a Dade Behring RXL autoanalyser. Esterified and non-esterified cholesterol measurements were made using an Amplex Red Cholesterol kit (Molecular Probes). Bile acids were measured using a TBA bile acid kit (Sentinel Diagnostics). Bile acids were extracted from livers by homogenization ten times in 70 % (v/v) ethanol.
Isolation of hepatocytes
Hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion of livers from 14-18-day-old anaesthetized mice. After isolation, cells were seeded in collagen-coated dishes in Medium 199 with Earle's salts and L-glutamine (Gibco) supplemented with UltroserG (Pall Life Sciences), 1 % (w/v) albumin, 100 nM insulin, 100 nM T3 (tri-iodothyronine) and 100 nM dexamethasone. After cell attachment, the hepatocytes were cultured for 16-18 h in the absence of T3, albumin and UltroserG and in the presence of 1 nM insulin
Bile acid uptake assay
The bile acid uptake assay was carried out as described previously [24].

qRT (quantitative real-time)-PCR analysis RNA was isolated from livers by homogenization in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by purification on an RNeasy column (Qiagen). A total of 2 g of RNA was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis using Superscript II (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and qRT-PCR was performed with SensiMix Plus SYBR kit (Quantace) using Opticon DNA Engine. All primers used are shown in Table 1. All values are shown relative to the expression of Cypb (cyclophilin b).
Hepatic glucose output measurement
At 16 h after isolation, hepatocytes were transferred into glucosefree DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) (Sigma) containing 2 mM sodium pyruvate and 20 mM lactate. Aliquots of medium were removed for glucose measurement at the stated times using a glucose oxidase kit (Thermo Scientific), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Statistical analysis All results are presented as means+-S.E.M. In order to determine statistical significance, an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test was performed for the analysis of two groups, whereas data involving more than two groups were assessed using ANOVA. Statistically significant differences from wild-type were considered for P values <0.05.
RESULTS
Generation of LLKB1KO mice
We crossed mice expressing Cre-recombinase under the control of the albumin promoter [25] with mice harbouring floxed alleles of Lkb1 [14] to generate Cre+/ - Lkb1fl/fl animals lacking LKB1 expression in the liver. PCR for the recombination event in a range of tissues demonstrated deletion of Lkb1 specifically in the liver (Figure 1A). LKB1 protein expression was not detectable in liver extracts from 15-day-old LLKB1KO mice (Figure 1B). Hepatic LKB1 activity was barely detectable following birth

and reached minimal levels by postnatal day 15 (Figure 1C), confirming functional deletion of LKB1 by 15 days of age. LKB1 protein expression and activity were also reduced in livers from Lkb1fl/fl mice (Figures 1B and 1C). These findings are consistent with a previous study [14] and arise due to the nature of the targeting event leading to a hypomorphic effect in several tissues. AMPK activity assayed in immune complexes isolated from liver extracts from LLKB1KO mice was drastically reduced relative to wild-type activity (Figure 1D). At 15 days, the activity of AMPK1-containing complexes was reduced by approx. 90 % and AMPK2 activity by >95 % in liver from LLKB1KO mice compared with the activity in liver extracts from wildtype mice (Figure 1D). There was also a slight reduction in AMPK activity in liver extracts isolated from Lkb1fl/fl mice, although this did not reach statistical significance for AMPK2 complexes (Figure 1D). In previous studies, it was reported that deletion of LKB1 in skeletal muscle [26] or heart [27] resulted in loss of AMPK2 activity, but AMPK1 activity was only partially reduced or was up-regulated. Given the results obtained in the present study in liver, the contribution of LKB1 to activation of AMPK1 appears to vary depending on the tissue type. LLKB1KO mice were noticeably smaller than either Lkb1fl/fl or wild-type mice and had significantly lower body weight from 4 days of age, and rapidly began to lose weight from around 15 days of age (Figure 1E). In contrast, the weight of livers isolated from LLKB1KO mice aged 15 days was significantly increased compared with wild-type mice (0.39+-0.045 g compared with 0.28+-0.008 g respectively, n = 9). This hepatomegaly resulted in a significant increase in the liver/body weight ratio (Figure 1F). By 12 days of age, LLKB1KO mice started to die and no LLKB1KO mice survived beyond 30 days of age (results not shown). We have been unable to find any obvious metabolic or growth phenotype for Lkb1fl/fl, even though there is a significant decrease in LKB1 activity in a number of tissues in these mice compared with wildtype animals. One notable exception is that the male Lkb1fl/fl mice are infertile due to a defect in spermatogenesis, which has been described in a previous study [28].
LKB1 deletion leads to disrupted canalicular membranes and defective bile duct formation
In order to explore the increased mortality of the LLKB1KO mice, we undertook histological examination of the liver. No gross morphological changes were apparent and the LLKB1KO mouse had a patent common bile duct. In livers from LLKB1KO mice as young as 4 days old, there were increased bile ductular profiles, but no well-formed ducts around the portal tracts. This observation became more apparent with increasing age, as shown in Figure 2(A) for liver isolated from a 15-day-old animal. Identification of normal bile ducts was difficult in tissue from LLKB1KO mice 15 days old or older, whereas bile ducts were clearly visible in livers from wild-type animals at an equivalent age (Figures 2A-2C). Immunostaining for either osteopontin (Figure 2B), a protein excreted by biliary epithelial cells, or CK19 (Figure 2C), a biliary cytokeratin, showed staining in morphologically normal bile ducts in wild-type liver (indicated by * in Figure 2). Although there was staining in liver from LLKB1KO mice, this was associated with the increased bile ductular profiles (indicated by an arrow in Figure 2) and confirmed the lack of morphologically normal bile ducts. The expression of radixin, a protein usually located at hepatic canalicular membranes, was clearly reduced in livers from LLKB1KO mice (Figure 2D). In contrast, vascular staining in LLKB1KO mice appeared normal (indicated by `v' in Figure 2, and results

In livers from LLKB1KO mice, abnormal canaliculi were apparent with microvilli often appearing `glued' together from as young as 6 days old. An example of a liver from a 15-day-old mouse is shown in Figure 3(B). In order to determine liver function,

serum levels of several liver markers were measured. By 15 days of age, serum levels of ALP, ALT (alanine transaminase) and AST (aspartate transaminase) were all significantly increased in LLKB1KO mice (Figure 3C), whereas albumin levels were lower compared with wild-type (Figure 3D). By 15-20 days, there were patchy areas of necrosis within livers from LLKB1KO mice (Figure 3E). No significant differences were detected in Lkb1fl/fl

LLKB1KO mice display marked changes in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism
Given the abnormal liver architecture and in particular the lack of normal bile ductule formation in the LLKB1KO mice, we investigated cholesterol and bile acid metabolism in these animals. Serum cholesterol levels were significantly elevated in LLKB1KO mice by 8 days of age and continued to rise with increasing age (Figure 4A). In wild-type mice, only 15 % of circulating

cholesterol was non-esterified, whereas in LLKB1KO mice more than 50 % was non-esterified (Figure 4B). Measured at 15 days of age, total cholesterol was significantly higher and LDLcholesterol was 10-fold higher in LLKB1KO mice compared with wild-type or Lkb1fl/fl mice, whereas HDL-cholesterol and triacyglycerol levels were not significantly changed (Figure 4C). There was a significant increase in the concentration of serum bile acids by 4 days of age in LLKB1KO mice relative to wild-type mice (Figure 4D). The increase in serum bile acids preceded the elevation in cholesterol levels (compare Figures 4A and 4D). Levels of bile acids in the livers of LLKB1KO mice were very high compared with wild-type, albeit with widely varying levels detected in individual mice (Figure 4E). The rate of

(E) Bile acids measured in liver extracts from wild-type (Wt) and LLKB1KO mice with the mean value shown by a bar (n = 5-6). (F) [3H]Taurocholate (TC) uptake was measured in hepatocytes isolated from 15-day-old wild-type or LLKB1KO mice. Uptake is shown relative to wild-type cells. Triplicate measurements of three independent experiments are shown. In each case, results are means+-S.E.M. Statistically significant differences from wild-type are indicated by * (P < 0.05), ** (P < 0.01) and *** (P < 0.001).

[3H]taurocholate uptake in isolated hepatocytes from LLKB1KO mice was 5-fold lower than in wild-type cells (Figure 4F), which could contribute to the elevated levels of serum bile acids. In order to confirm that the hepatocytes isolated from the LLKB1KO animals are viable, we measured glucose output in these cells. Hepatic glucose output was increased in the LLKB1KO cells compared with wild-type cells under basal conditions (Figure 4G). This result is consistent with a previous study in which LKB1 was deleted in adult hepatocytes [29], and demonstrates that the hepatocytes isolated from LLKB1KO mice are metabolically competent to undergo gluconeogenesis, confirming their viability.
We went on to measure the expression of a number of genes known to play a role in bile acid transport and homoeostasis (Figure 5A). There was a significant change in some of the genes normally regulated by elevated levels of bile acids. The genes encoding the basolateral transporters OATP1 (organic anion transporting polypeptide 1) and NTCP were down-regulated, whereas expression of the gene encoding the basolateral efflux

transporter MRP4 (multi-drug resistance protein 4) was increased. However, some of the genes expected to be altered by FXR activation due to high levels of bile acids, such as genes encoding SHP (small heterodimer partner), CYP7A1 (cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily A, polypeptide 1), ABCG5/8 (ABC subfamily G, member 5/8), MRP3 and BSEP, were not significantly altered. In addition, we found a decrease in the expression of the gene encoding MRP2, which encodes a canalicular anion transporter, whereas other studies have found an increase in expression in response to elevated bile acids [16]. Despite the increase in cholesterol levels in the LLKB1KO mice, there were no significant changes in the expression of a number of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (Figure 5B), suggesting that there is no overall up-regulation in cholesterol synthesis. Taken together, these findings led us to investigate whether the underlying cause of hepatic bile acid accumulation is a defect in bile acid clearance. This would be consistent with the lack of open bile ductules revealed by our histological analyses (Figure 2).

Defective targeting of BSEP in LLKB1KO mice
Since our present findings indicate that increased bile acids in LLKB1KO mice result from defective clearance, we examined the expression of BSEP, one of the key components of bile acid efflux in the liver. BSEP protein expression was unchanged in livers from LLKB1KO mice, as measured by Western blotting (results not shown). We therefore extended our analysis to determine the localization of BSEP protein. In wild-type mice, as expected, BSEP was localized predominantly at the canalicular membrane (Figure 6A). In marked contrast, in liver from LLKB1KO mice, BSEP was found mainly within the cytoplasm, appearing to be associated with cytoplasmic vesicles (Figures 6A and 6B). There was no obvious difference in localization of NTCP, a basolateral membrane protein (Figure 6C). However, we observed lower NTCP staining in sections of liver from LLKB1KO mice compared with wild-type mice.
Loss of hepatic LKB1 leads to abnormal red blood cells and hyperbilirubinaemia
Examination of red blood cells from LLKB1KO mice at 18 days of age showed an abnormal morphology, exhibiting a `spiky' appearance (Figure 7A). This altered morphology is similar to that described for spur cells of patients with severe liver disease [30]. The red blood cells from LLKB1KO mice were also shown to be more resistant to changes in osmolarity (Figure 7B). The packed red blood cell volume of LLKB1KO mice was significantly lower than that in wild-type mice (Figure 7C), implying that the LLKB1KO mice could be anaemic. Circulating levels of bilirubin, a product of heam breakdown, were dramatically increased in LLKB1KO mice, leading to a bright yellow coloration of the serum (Figure 7D). Bilirubin in serum from either wild-type or Lkb1fl/fl mice was virtually undetectable, whereas in LLKB1KO mice the levels were hugely elevated, the majority of which was conjugated which shows some functionality of the liver in the older mice.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we have shown that mice lacking the expression of LKB1 in the liver have profound abnormalities in liver architecture and cell morphology that result in severe defects in bile and cholesterol metabolism. Although LKB1 activity was reduced in the liver of Lkb1fl/fl mice, there was no hepatic phenotype, suggesting that there is significant `spare capacity' within the signalling pathway, and that LKB1 is not rate-limiting. This may be a more general feature of protein kinase signalling pathways, for example mice expressing 10 % of the normal levels of PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) appear normal, whereas complete deletion results in embryonic lethality [31]. Our present results show that LKB1 is required for the normal postnatal development of the biliary system, including correct localization of canalicular membrane proteins and development of bile ducts. The molecular mechanisms underlying development of the biliary tree are poorly understood. A number of other studies have demonstrated that LKB1 plays a key role in determining polarity in mammalian cells, as well as in other model organisms [32]. Activation of LKB1 has been shown to cause complete polarization of single mammalian epithelial cells [33]. An attractive hypothesis is that LKB1 is required for polarization of hepatocytes and that disruption of the normal development of the bile canaliculi in the LLKB1KO mice is a consequence of a defect in polarity determination. In support of this, we found that BSEP and radixin were no longer targeted to the canalicular membrane in the absence of LKB1. The failure to thrive and loss of weight of LLKB1KO mice may be caused by poor absorption of nutrients from the intestine due to the inability to transport bile from the liver via the biliary tree, which is defective in these animals.
Associated with the marked anatomical abnormalities observed in LLKB1KO mice we found a number of metabolic defects. There was a dramatic increase in serum and liver bile acids which stems from defective clearance of bile acids into the canaliculus as a direct consequence of mis-localization of BSEP. Previous studies have shown that bile acids regulate the transcription of

genes encoding proteins involved in bile acid metabolism and transport. However, in spite of elevated circulating bile acids, some of the genes known to be transcriptionally controlled by FXR [34] were not altered in liver from LLKB1KO mice. We observed a decrease in the expression of the basolateral transporters Oatp1 and Ntcp, as well as decreased staining of NTCP in the livers from LLKB1KO mice, which would explain a decrease in the taurocholate uptake in the isolated hepatocytes from LLKB1KO animals (Figure 4F). However, the expected transcriptional up-regulation of those transporters in the canalicular membrane, for example Bsep, Abcg5/8 and Mrp2, is not apparent in the livers from LLKB1KO mice. There appears to be a lack of control of those genes involved in expression of proteins located to the canalicular membrane. Expression of the gene encoding CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, is not decreased in response to the elevated bile acids in the livers from LLKB1KO mice. The intestine, as well as the liver, plays a critical role in bile acid homoeostasis. It has been shown that, in response to bile acids in the intestine, FXR stimulates FGF15 (fibroblast growth factor 15) expression in the

intestine which signals via FGFR4 (FGF receptor 4) to bring about down-regulation of CYP7A1 in the liver. [35]. However, this route of control is likely to be defective in the LLKB1KO mice because bile acids are not flowing into the bile for release into the intestine and so cannot activate intestinal FXR. In this case, transcriptional suppression of CYP7A1 by FGF15 signalling would not be expected to occur, which may explain the modest decrease in expression that we observe in liver from LLKB1KO mice.
Dramatically elevated levels of circulating non-esterified cholesterol were observed in the LLKB1KO mice, which is most likely to be a secondary effect resulting from the reduced clearance of bile acids. It has been reported that cholestasis results in the appearance of a specific form of lipoprotein, LPX (lipoprotein-X), which has a high content of non-esterified cholesterol and unusual protein content [36,37]. It is likely that LP-X makes up a proportion of the elevated LDL observed in the LLKB1KO mice. An attractive hypothesis is that the increased circulating free cholesterol leads to the defect in red blood cells that we observed in the LLKB1KO mice.

Supporting this is a previous study that has shown that high circulating free cholesterol can alter the composition of the red blood cell membrane [38]. Excess membrane cholesterol leads to characteristic morphological abnormalities and formation of spur cells. The altered lipid composition of the red blood cell membrane results in spur cells with decreased deformability, which is essential for passage through capillary beds [39]. Destruction of the spur cells by the spleen ultimately leads to anaemia, as the bone marrow cannot produce sufficient new cells to compensate for the loss. The increased destruction of red blood cells leads to a further increase in circulating bilirubin, which cannot be appropriately disposed of in the bile due to defective canaliculi and bile ducts, thereby leading to excessive accumulation in the serum. It is apparent that the liver is able to conjugate the majority of the excess bilirubin, which shows the

liver, even in late stages, maintains some functionality and the hyperbilirubinaemia is probably due to impaired transport and export from the liver. In a previous study, it has been shown that radixin deficiency causes conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia with loss of MRP2 (the major transporter of bilirubin) from the canalicular membranes [40]. As radixin is depleted in LLKB1KO mice, this is a possible explanation for elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin.
In a previous study in which LKB1 expression was deleted in adult liver [15], there was no report of altered bile acid or cholesterol metabolism. One possible reason for the absence of this phenotype could be that LKB1 activity was not completely abolished in that model, and that this might reduce the severity of the subsequent phenotype. However, an alternative explanation is that, in adult livers, biliary tree formation would have progressed

normally through development, precluding the onset of the phenotype we describe in our model.
The lack of open tubular bile ducts and areas of necrosis in the postnatal livers observed in livers from LLKB1KO mice are akin to observations seen in murine models of Alagille syndrome which are due to alterations in Notch signalling [41,42]. As in Notch2 inactivation, loss of LKB1 activity results in defective intrahepatic bile duct development. However, to date, there has been no direct connection made between Notch and LKB1 signalling pathways, although further investigation may be warranted.
In summary, in the present study we have shown a key role for LKB1 in co-ordinating the localization of canalicular membrane proteins and canalicular formation. The lack of LKB1 leads to the inability of the liver to transport and dispose of constituents of bile, resulting in a toxic build up of circulating bile acids, bilirubin and non-esterified cholesterol. It is noteworthy that deletion of both AMPK1 and 2 in the liver does not result in a similar phenotype to the present model [43], but a very recent study in isolated hepatocytes reported a role for LKB1 and AMPK in the formation and maintenance of the canalicular network [44]. This finding supports a role for LKB1, AMPK and AMPK-related kinases in bile acid metabolism and canalicular formation. Further studies aimed at investigating the role of AMPK and the AMPKrelated kinases downstream of LKB1 in hepatic development and liver disease is warranted. In summary, our present study uncovers a new role for LKB1 in the liver adding to the list of diverse functions of this master regulatory kinase.

ABSTRACT Introduction: This multicentre randomised controlled
clinical trial will aim to determine the ability of an extract (TJ-100) of Daikenchuto (traditional Japanese herbal medicine; Kampo) to prevent bowel dysfunction in at least 110 patients after liver transplantation (LT).
Methods and analysis: The following co-primary
end points will be evaluated on postoperative day 7: total oral and enteral caloric intake, abdominal distension and abdominal pain. The secondary end points will comprise sequential changes of total oral and enteral caloric intake after LT, sequential changes in numeric rating scales for abdominal distension and pain, elapsed time to the first postoperative passage of stool, quality of life assessment using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale score ( Japanese version), postoperative liver function, liver regeneration rate, incidence of bacteraemia and bacterial strain, trough level of immunosuppressants, occurrence of acute cellular rejection, discharge or not within 2 months after LT, sequential changes of portal venous flow to the graft and ascites discharge. The two arms of the study will comprise 55 patients per arm.
Ethics and dissemination: The study has been
conducted according to the CONSORT statement. All participants signed a written consent form, and the study has been approved by the institutional review board of each participating institute and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1996. The findings will be disseminated through scientific and professional conferences, and in peer-reviewed journals.
Trial registration number: The DKB 14 Study was
registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registration (UMINCTR), Japan (registration number: UMIN000014326) during 2014.
INTRODUCTION Liver transplantation (LT) is one of the most extensive surgeries for patients with end-

stage liver diseases including liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and acute liver failure. Moreover, protein-energy malnutrition is common in patients with end-stage liver disease requiring LT and closely associated with post-transplant risk of morbidity and mortality.1-3 Such patients are usually accompanied by bowel dysfunction after LT due to long surgical durations and wide abdominal incisions, which prevents early postoperative food intake either orally or via an enteral tube and subsequently leads to worsening malnutrition.
The enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol has recently been introduced to various types of surgery including organ transplantation.4-7 Postoperative management recommended by the ERAS protocol includes the early initiation of normal food intake or enteral feeding after gastrointestinal surgery. Moreover, early tube feeding (within 24 h) is indicated for patients in whom early oral nutrition cannot be initiated due to obvious undernutrition at the time of surgery. However, normal food intake or enteral feeding cannot be started when a patient has bowel dysfunction.
Daikenchuto is a traditional Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo) that has been frequently prescribed to prevent and treat postoperative ileus in Japan.8 9 The powdered extract of Daikenchuto, TJ-100 (Tsumura & Co, Tokyo, Japan), is available as an aqueous extract containing 2.2% Japanese pepper, 5.6% processed ginger, 3.3% ginseng and 88.9% powdered maltose syrup. A recent multicentre phase III trial ( JFMC40-1001) found that TJ-100 significantly reduced the elapsed time to the first bowel movement compared with a placebo after hepatic

resection.10 However, the ability of TJ-100 to normalise bowel paralysis after LT and its effects on early total caloric intake delivered orally or enterally after surgery (a key element of the ERAS protocol) have not been prospectively investigated. Therefore, we designed a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the enhancement effects of TJ-100 on oral and enteral caloric intake and its ability to prevent postoperative paralytic ileus in patients after undergoing living donor LT (LDLT) or deceased donor LT (DDLT).
METHODS AND ANALYSIS Objective Postoperative early oral or enteral intake is a crucial element of the ERAS protocol. The DKB 14 Study is a multicentre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that aims to determine the enhancement effect of TJ-100 on oral and enteral caloric intake and its ability to prevent postoperative paralytic ileus in patients after LDLT and DDLT.
Resources A research grant from Tsumura & Co, Tokyo, Japan.
End points The following primary end points will be evaluated at postoperative day (POD) 7:  Total oral or enteral caloric intake;  Abdominal distension determined using numeric
rating scales (NRS);  Abdominal pain determined using NRS. The following secondary end points will be evaluated:  Chronological changes in total oral or enteral caloric
intake at POD 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14;  Chronological changes in NRS at POD 5, 7, 10 and
14;  Elapsed time from extubation until the first post-
operative defaecation;  Quality of life assessment using the Gastrointestinal
Symptom Rating Scale score ( Japanese V.1.2) at POD 7 and 14;  Liver function determined by measuring total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, -glutamyl transpeptidase, choline esterase at POD 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14;  Liver regeneration rates determined by CT and calculated as postoperative liver volume/graft liver weight at the time of LT between POD 14 and 21 and graft volume for all patients except those who underwent whole LT;  The incidence of bacteraemia until POD 14 and bacterial strain;  Trough levels of immunosuppressants at POD 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14;  The incidence of acute cellular rejection until POD 14;

 Discharge or not within 2 months after LT;  Flow speed and volume of the portal vein at POD 3,
5, 7, 10 and 14;  Ascites volume (mL/day) from abdominal drain at
POD 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14.
Eligibility criteria Inclusion  Patients with end-stage liver disease who are sched-
uled to undergo LT  Age 20 years at the time of registration  Satisfies the indication criteria for LT at each partici-
pating institution  Written informed consent provided to participate in
the study
Exclusion  Uncontrollable active infection other than liver  Uncontrollable malignant diseases other than hepato-
cellular carcinoma  Clinically problematic dysfunction of other organs  Likely to have severe intra-abdominal adhesion due to a
history of surgeries or past history of mechanical ileus  Medication with antipsychotic, antidepressant or
gastrointestinal prokinetic drugs  Patients who take other Kampo medicines  Women who are pregnant or lactating  Any other medical condition that would render a
patient unsuitable for inclusion according to the opinion of the investigator (at each institution).
Registration An eligibility report form will be delivered to the registration centre at the Institute for Advancement of Clinical and Translational Science, Kyoto University Hospital. Eligible patients will be centrally randomised to either Arm A (TJ-100) or Arm B ( placebo) in accordance with the minimisation method for assigning patients to Arm A or Arm B according to the type of LT (LDLT or DDLT), body weight (<60 or 60 kg), age (<50 or 50 years) and the institution as variables before LT. Information regarding required follow-up evaluations will then be sent from the registration centre at the Institute for Advancement of Clinical and Translational Science.
The randomisation list will not be known in advance by the investigators. The statistical analysis and preparation of tables and graphs for the report of the study by the statistician of the study will be blinded to the extent possible. The unblinding may take place only after all data have been entered into the database of the study, all requests have been closed and the database has been frozen by the Data Manager of the study.
Treatment methods Arm A: TJ-100 group TJ-100 (5 g in solution) will be administered either orally or enterally via a tube three times per day

immediately before meals or every 8 h for 14 consecutive days between POD 1 and 14.
Arm B: placebo group Placebo (5 g in solution) will be administered either orally or enterally via a tube three times per day immediately before meals or every 8 h for 14 consecutive days between POD 1 and 14.
TJ-100 and a matching placebo were manufactured by Tsumura & Co (Tokyo, Japan).
We monitor adherence by hearing each patient and checking the number of trial drugs (TJ-100 or placebo) that are not administered.
Prohibited or permitted drugs Prohibited drugs: drugs that are known to promote bowel movement are prohibited during the protocol treatment: erythromycin, acetylcholine chloride, itopride hydrochloride, mosapride citrate, aclatonium napadisilate, neostigmine methylsulfate, pantethine, panthenol, prostaglandin F2, prosultiamine, fursultiamine, trimebutine maleate, amidotrizoate sodium meglumine.
Permitted drugs: metoclopramide or domperidone to treat postoperative nausea/vomiting, and immunosuppressants including tacrolimus, cyclosporine, steroid, azathioprine, mizoribin and mycophenolate mofetil.
Criteria for discontinuing the protocol treatment Grade 3 postoperative diarrhoea or other clinical adverse effects (CTCAE V.4.0 criteria).
Data collection Prospective data about all patients including medical history, physical findings, laboratory findings, perioperative clinical information and complications will be collected.
Study design and statistical analysis The primary end points will be statistically evaluated at POD 7 (total oral or enteral caloric intake, abdominal distension and abdominal pain determined using NRS).
The multiplicity issue (inflation of type I error) due to the analysis of three end points will be addressed using the fixed-sequence testing method. The order of the tests will be fixed, which controls the familywise error rate. The testing procedure will start from a hypothesis about the total oral and enteral caloric intake, and will be followed by the NRS for abdominal distension and the NRS for abdominal symptoms in that order. Each test will proceed only if all previously tested hypotheses have been rejected. Each hypothesis will be tested at the 5% significance level. The sample size was calculated on the basis of our previous finding that the mean value of the total oral and enteral caloric intake at POD 7 without the administration of TJ-100 is about 1000 kcal/ day (SD=850) (unpublished data). We speculated that patients administered with TJ-100 would have an intake of 500 kcal/day more than those who were not administered with TJ-100. Thus, assuming that the two arms

have the same SD, the sample size was calculated on the basis of a t test with a two-sided significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, which resulted in a requirement of 47 patients per group. Taking about 15% exclusion from analysis into account, the number of patients to be accrued was set at 55 per treatment arm (110 in total). If the sample for analyses is 47 per group and the twosided significance level is 5%, and if the probability of an event in which the value of the NRS in Arm A is larger than that in Arm B is about 0.62, then the Wilcoxon rank-sum test would have an approximate power of 80% for each NRS test of abdominal distension and abdominal symptoms. The first primary end point, the total oral and enteral caloric intake at POD 7, will be compared between the two treatment groups using the t test. The second and the third primary end points, the values of NRS on abdominal distension and abdominal pain, will be compared between the two treatment groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. When the total oral and caloric enteral intake data at POD 7 for 50 patients are collected, we will conduct an interim analysis to confirm the distribution of total oral and enteral caloric intake at POD 7 under double-blind conditions. If the distribution obviously deviates from the normal distribution, then the Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used for the primary analysis of the total oral and enteral caloric intake at POD 7.
Participating institutions Fourteen leading Japanese institutions that perform LT will participate in this trial.
Registration of the protocol The protocol was approved by the institutional review board of each participating institute and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1996. Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before enrolment and randomisation by investigators. The DKB 14 Study was registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registration (UMIN-CTR), Japan (registration number: UMIN000014326) during 2014.
Study status This study is currently collecting data and there has not been any publication concerning the analysis of the data collected to date.

ABSTRACT Objectives To assess if there is any association between hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), psychological morbidity and infant bonding and to quantify any psychosocial consequences of HG. Design Two-춑oint prospective case-control, multicentre survey study with antenatal and postnatal data collection. Setting Three London hospitals. Participants Pregnant women at 12 completed weeks gestation recruited consecutively over 2years. Women with HG were recruited at the time of admission; controls recruited from a low risk antenatal clinic. 106 women were recruited to the case group and 108 to the control. Response rates at antenatal data collection were 87% and 85% in the case and control groups, respectively. Postnatally, the response rate was 90% in both groups. Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary outcomes were psychological morbidity in the antenatal and postnatal periods, infant bonding in the postnatal period and psychosocial implications of HG. Secondary outcomes were the effects of severity and longevity of HG and assessment of correlation between Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores and maternal-춗o-i춏fant bonding scores. Results Antenatally, 49% of cases had probable depression compared with 6% of controls (OR 14.4 (5.29 to 39.44)). Postnatally, 29% of cases had probable depression versus 7% of controls (OR 5.2 (1.65 to 17.21)). There was no direct association between HG and infant bonding. 53% of women in the HG group reported needing four or more weeks of sick leave compared with 2% in the control group (OR 60.5 (95% CI 8.4 to 2535.6)). Conclusions Long-춍asting psychological morbidity associated with HG was evident. Significantly more women in the case group sought help for mental health symptoms in the antenatal period, however very few were diagnosed with or treated for depression in pregnancy or referred to specialist perinatal mental

Strengths and limitations of this study
 A case-control format was adopted using validated questionnaires to assess psychological morbidity both during and after pregnancy.
 Attrition rates of eligible women were low despite the long interval between surveys.
 Self-춖election participation could have led to an underestimate or overestimate of the true size effects of hyperemesis gravidarum.
 The use of patient contact via text message enabled women to complete surveys on their smartphones; this may improve response rates in other survey studies.
 The extent of the sociodemographic differences identified between the two groups are potential confounding factors of unknown magnitude for psychological morbidity.
health services. HG did not directly affect infant bonding. Women in the case group required long periods off work, highlighting the socioeconomic impact of HG.
INTRODUCTION Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) affects a large proportion of women with varying estimates of prevalence ranging from 35% to 91% with an average of 69% reporting symptoms of varying severity.1 A small percentage of women with NVP will develop a more severe form of the condition, traditionally termed hyperemesis gravidarum (HG). Severe NVP or HG is one of the most common reasons for hospital admission in the first half of pregnancy.2 At present, there is no universally agreed definition for HG, which has implications

for research in the area, however, it is most commonly accepted that the term is used to describe a severe form of NVP requiring secondary care intervention.3 The aetiology of HG has been widely studied with no one cause identified; it is thought to be complex and multifactorial.4
In addition to the physical implications of HG, the condition has been found to have significant social, psychological and economic implications for women and their families.5-7 The efficacy of supportive medical treatment such as antiemetics and intravenous hydration is variable8 and HG sufferers require a wider reaching level of care which extends beyond management of physical symptoms.9 Previous studies have identified that wider society including many medical professionals and relatives of sufferers may not appreciate the true physical, psychological and psychosocial burden of HG.10-14 Women have been found to face negative sequelae relating to stress levels, poor quality of life, post-춗raumatic stress disorder (PTSD), low self-e춖teem, financial and relationship strains.13-16 Attard et al14 concluded that it is considered likely the true burden of HG has not yet been appreciated.
A recent systematic review and meta-춁nalysis studies established a clear relationship between HG and psychological morbidity.9 12 13 15 17-30 The meta-a nalysis of studies using comparable numerical scoring systems to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety found a large effect relationship between HG and antenatal (AN) anxiety and a very large effect relationship between HG and depression.9
There is very little evidence on the longevity of psychological morbidity related to HG, particularly in the postnatal (PN) period. Simpson et al23 conducted a small case-control study using various psychological scales in women with HG in pregnancy and asymptomatic controls. This included assessing symptoms of anxiety and depression (Symptom Checklist, SCL-90 scale) and also utilised a hypochondriasis scale, hysteria scale, paranoia scale, somatisation scale and schizophrenia scale. The study found that participants with HG were suffering from greater levels of anxiety, depression, psychoticism and obsessive-compulsive characteristics compared with the control group. In the PN data, there was, however, no significant difference in any scale scores.23 This study involved only nine cases and 10 controls in the AN group and 10 cases and 12 controls in the PN group and control populations were not consistent as only a small proportion of those being assessed in the AN period went on to participate in the PN study with the other participants recruited de novo.23
Infant bonding in women following a pregnancy effected by HG has never previously been studied. McCormack looked at fetal attachment at two different stages of pregnancy18 and found that in early pregnancy, when women were suffering from symptoms of HG, fetal attachment was compromised but that this no longer evident in later pregnancy when symptoms had resolved.

Given the prevalence of HG, there appears to be a lack of good quality evidence looking at the psychological and psychosocial consequences of the condition with many of the published studies having major methodological flaws.9 16 In our study, therefore, we comprehensively assessed the relationship between HG and depression using validated scales with a longitudinal approach to determine whether psychological morbidity continues beyond pregnancy and leads to increased rates of (PN) depression in women who suffered with HG during pregnancy. Additionally, we investigated, for the first time, whether HG affects infant bonding in the PN period and addressed lesser explored possible psychosocial implications of HG.
MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was performed as a prospective longitudinal case-control two-p oint survey study comparing women with a diagnosis of HG to a control group of pregnant women without significant NVP. The study was multicentred and all data collection was carried out over a 2-춞ear period between April 2015 and April 2017. The cases were recruited from three sites (Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London; Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, London; St Mary's Hospital London). The control group were recruited from the primary study centre (Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London). To reduce confounding factor bias, women with a current mental health condition were excluded, though women with a history of a mental health condition remained eligible. A current mental health condition was defined in the study as a psychological illness requiring consultation with a healthcare professional within the past 12 months.
Participants Cases Cases were consecutively approached when presenting with symptoms of severe NVP requiring hospital treatment in all three units over the 2-y춅ar study period. Inclusion criteria for the cases were a diagnosis of HG as documented by the assessing specialist clinician and requiring hospital care (women having inpatient or outpatient management both included); age 18-50; pregnancy 12 completed weeks gestation; planning to continue the pregnancy; adequate spoken and written English. Exclusion criteria were current mental health condition; other cause(s) of NVP identified before or during the episode of hospital care; not planning or uncertain about continuing with the pregnancy.
Controls Controls were recruited from a low risk AN midwifery led clinic at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital over the same 2-춞ear time period (April 2015 and April 2017). Researchers attended this clinic on a monthly basis and approached all women attending. The aim of the study was

to recruit the same number of cases and controls, hence recruitment sessions were limited to a monthly session. As part of the screening process, women were asked to complete a Pregnancy-쵻nique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) questionnaire.31 All women attending this clinic on the specified day were consecutively approached at this booking clinic which was triaged to capture low-춓isk women. Inclusion criteria for the control group were age 18-50, pregnancy 12 completed weeks gestation; planning to continue the pregnancy; adequate spoken and written English. Exclusion criteria for the control group were current mental health condition; significant NVP, defined as a PUQE score31 6 (participants were asked to score their symptoms (if any) of NVP on the day they felt worst prior to recruitment); development of severe NVP/ HG following recruitment. Women were asked to contact the research team if they had an increase in any symptoms of NVP, for example if they attended their general practitioner (GP) with a complaint of NVP. In addition, hospital records were monitored to identify any presentations with NVP. If this did occur, these women were withdrawn from the study as they no longer met the inclusion criteria for the control group (PUQE 6).
Consent and pregnancy monitoring Written consent was obtained from all participants. Women were provided with written information about the study, including information about how to contact the research team, how to make a complaint regarding the study and about psychological health during and after pregnancy. As part of routine AN care, women are directed to the local mental health services available in the AN and PN periods. Women were asked if they consented to telephone contact as ethical approval had been obtained to send text reminders from an online server with links to the surveys, allowing women to complete these on their smartphones. Following recruitment, a confirmation email was sent to all participants which included their individual study number and confirmed details of how to contact their local researcher and the study lead researcher. Women were followed during their pregnancy and all pregnancy complications and outcomes were collected. These data were obtained from the clinical data computer system at each site and a further electronic database via which birth registration records, including maternal and neonatal complication data, were generated following delivery. St Mary's Hospital and Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital had shared clinical data access as they were part of the same NHS Trust (Imperial College NHS Trust). The specific pregnancy complications recorded were hypertensive disorders, intrauterine growth restriction, gestational diabetes, obstetric cholestasis, abnormal placentation and antepartum haemorrhage.
Data collection tools The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a widely used scale to screen for symptoms of depression in the AN and PN periods.32 33 The score was used as a

continuous and categorical outcome measure. For the categorical data, the commonly used 13 threshold for probable AN/PN depression was used.33 34 The sensitivity/specificity for major depressive disorder at this cut- off is 0.89/0.90 in the AN period and 0.80/0.93 in the PN period.34 Question 10 of the survey relates to thoughts of self-춉arm. As set out in the trial ethics and protocol, we maintained oversight of the survey responses to identify women responding `sometimes' or `yes, quite often' to this question. These women were contacted and an urgent referral made to the perinatal psychiatry team.
The Maternal-t춐-쵪nfant Bonding Scale is a numerical scoring system to assess maternal feelings towards their baby using eight numerically scored terms with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 24.35 The scale with its scoring system is shown in figure 1.35
In addition to these validated surveys, women were asked to complete a PN questionnaire (online supplemental data 1) regarding their psychological and psychosocial well-b춅ing during pregnancy. Participants were asked if they had sought help for psychological symptoms during and/or after pregnancy and, if so, from whom; if a diagnosis of psychological condition had been made during and/or after pregnancy and, if so, how this was managed. Additionally, women working at the time of participation were asked how much time they took off work during pregnancy due to HG-춓elated or other illness. Women in the cases (HG) group were asked at what gestation in pregnancy their symptoms resolved.
Data collection points There were two designated data collection (survey) points for the study. The AN data collection point (designated Survey Point 1, S1) was at 12 completed weeks of pregnancy. The PN data collection point (designated Survey Point 2, S2) was at 6 weeks postdelivery. Only the EPDS was used at S1 whereas the EPDS, The Maternal-춗o-I춏fant Bonding Scale and the PN questionnaire were used at S2.
The course of each participant's pregnancy was monitored and continued eligibility for each survey was checked prior to each contact. Women were prospectively withdrawn from the study and not sent the first

survey (S1) for the following reasons; participant request withdrawal; pregnancy loss; termination of pregnancy; development of significant NVP (control group); lost to follow-u p. Women who had not booked their pregnancy at the recruiting hospital were excluded as the pregnancy status was unknown. Women delivering prematurely (<37 weeks gestation) were not eligible for S2 due to the potential of confounding factor bias on maternal- to-춊nfant bonding and maternal psychological sequelae of premature delivery.36 37 A similar rationale was used to prospectively exclude participants at S2 pregnancies with a known major fetal anomaly as these babies were expected to be admitted to the neonatal unit, potentially for long periods.36 Other exclusions at S2 were participant withdrawal, non-춓esponse to S1, pregnancy loss, neonatal death, termination of pregnancy and unknown pregnancy outcome.
At each survey point, participants were sent an email and link to complete the survey via the online survey tool SurveyMonkey. If the survey was not completed 7-10 days following this initial email, then a text message reminder with a further link to the survey was sent (assuming participants had consented to the use of telephone contact). The text message was sent from an online server using the sender ID `The HIPPI Study'. If required, a second reminder was sent via email a further 7-10 days later. Participants were considered non-r춅sponders 4weeks after the initial survey request email was sent. A flow chart of the participant journey is shown in figure 2.

Statistical analysis and sample size
Baseline characteristics and clinical measures were summarised using standard descriptive statistics; frequency (%) for categorical variables and mean (SD) for continuous variables, or median (IQR) if they were positively skewed. For two groups comparison, we performed a univariate analysis using the 2 test for dichotomous variables and the t-t est or Mann-W hitney U test for continuous variables. All calculated p-v alues were two-춖ided and analysis was carried out using Stata statistical software, release V.14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Sample size calculation was performed using the validated assessment tools. For EPDS, calculation accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.1 in a two-s춊ded test was performed. In a control group of women, the mean EPDS score in the PN period was 7.2 with a SD of 4.8.32 Therefore, to detect a difference in mean of 3.0 between the two groups, 54 participants were needed in each group to have 90% power at 5% significance level with an SD of 4.8. For the Maternal-춗o-쵪nfant Bonding Scale, a mean of 1.21 was used with an SD of 1.42.35 Therefore, to detect a difference of 1.0 in mean bonding scale score, 43 participants were needed in each group with a 90% power at 5% significance level with an SD of 1.42. The higher estimate of 54 participants per group was used. As the study was a survey study involving active patient participation, a relatively high non-춓esponse rate was expected, particularly as the two data points were spread over a near 9-춎onth period. Additionally, many women recruited were anticipated to become ineligible for either S1 or S2 due to reasons such as pregnancy loss, development of significant NVP (among controls), termination of pregnancy, preterm birth (S2) and non- response to S1 (ineligible for S2). For this reason, a 20% loss to follow-u p rate was estimated and the final target minimum recruitment numbers were 65 women per group. As it was difficult to anticipate response rates and exclusions over the longitudinal AN and PN survey study, we decided to recruit women over the full 2-y춅ar study period. We anticipated that a loss to follow-u p rate of 20% may be too low an estimate given the study design, hence recruiting over the full 24-m onth period would maximise the chances of achieving the necessary S2 survey data for analysis.
Three secondary outcome analyses were performed; (1) to assess if there was a stronger relationship between HG and depression (as measured by EPDS score) in women with `severe HG' and those with `other HG'. Severe HG was arbitrarily defined as women with any of the following; hospital treatment of 5 days; three or more admissions during the first trimester; the need to have third line antiemetic treatment (systemic steroids) according to our local treatment protocol, (2) to assess if duration of symptoms of HG influenced mean EPDS scores and (3) to determine if having an EPDS of 13 (probable depression)33 had a significant effect on Maternal-춗o-쵪nfant Bonding Scale score. For duration of symptoms, women in the case group were categorised into

two groups depending on their response to the PN questionnaire regarding when/if their symptoms resolved; group 1; resolved at or before 20 weeks gestation and group 2; symptoms resolved after 20 weeks duration or participants reported symptoms throughout pregnancy.
Patient involvement During the design of the study, a prior group of 30 women were surveyed on the following; whether they would be willing to take part in this type of study, how they would like to provide information and how they would like to be contacted.
Results 120 women were screened for the case group, of whom 10 were ineligible to participate (current mental health condition n=5, admission for other condition this pregnancy n=2, planning termination n=3) and four declined, giving a total number recruited of 106. For the control group, 126 women were screened, of whom 15 were ineligible (current mental health condition n=9, PQUE 6 n=6) and three declined, giving a recruitment total of 108. Comparison of background variables between groups is shown in table 1.
Women in the case group were younger (p=<0.001), more likely to be of black/Afro-C춁ribbean ethnicity (p=0.010), be single (p=0.016), live with relatives (p=0.003) or in social housing (p=0.017) and be of lower educational status (p=0.006). There was no significant difference between cases and controls in previous history of mental health conditions at recruitment (15% in cases and 19% in controls, p=0.482). Recruitment, eligibility, response rates and pregnancy outcomes are shown in figure 3.
Comparison of EPDS scores at survey point 1 (AN) and survey point 2 (PN) Women in the case group had significantly higher EPDS scores at both S1 and S2. At S1, the mean EPDS score in the case group was 12.3 (SD 6.1) compared with a mean of 4.8 (SD 3.2) in the control group (p=<0.001). At S2, cases had a mean score of 9.2 (SD 6.1) compared with 6.0 (SD 4.2) in the control group (p=0.002). In categorical analysis, women in the case group had an OR of 14.4 (95% CI 5.29 to 39.44) of having an EPDS score of 13 (probable depression) at S1. At S2, the OR was 5.33 (95% CI 1.65 to 17.21). The results of continuous and categorical comparison of EPDS scores in the case group versus the control group at S1 and S2 are shown in tables 2 and 3, respectively.
At the AN assessment seven women, all in the case group, reported thoughts of self-h춁rm. According to protocol, they were contacted directly and their AN care provider or GP informed.

in Maternal-t춐-쵪nfant Bonding Scale scores at 6 weeks postpartum, as shown in table 4.
Comparison of the PN questionnaire responses Analysis of the PN questionnaire demonstrated that significantly more women in the case group reported mental health symptoms to a healthcare professional (GP and/or midwife as first point of contact) in the AN period; 46% cases versus 23% controls (OR 8.67 (3.00 to 25.02)). In the PN period, we found that the difference was no longer significant; 27% cases versus 21% controls (OR 1.03 (0.38 to 2.81)). Overall, more women in the case group reported receiving a diagnosis of a mental health condition during pregnancy and/or postpartum; 29% cases versus 12% controls (OR 2.93 (1.10 to 7.82)). Despite this, there was no difference between groups in the number of women who received treatment for mental health issues during or after pregnancy (OR 0.88 (0.13 to 6.19)).
Employment rates in the case group were 74% versus 79% in the control group, with no significant difference in unemployment rates (p=0.236). The 11 women in the case group that were not in paid employment were all multiparous and primary carers for children under 5 years of age. In the HG group, the median time off work for sickness during pregnancy was 5 weeks (range 1-9) compared with a median of 2 (range 1-4) in the control group. Of the employed cases participants, 53% of women in the case group took four or more weeks sick leave (prior to planned maternity leave) during pregnancy compared with 2% of controls (OR 61.5 (95% CI 8.4 to 2535.6)).
40% (32/81) women in the case group fulfilled the criteria for `severe HG'. In the `severe HG' group, the median total nights admission (or OP treatment spells) was 6 (range 4-10), the median number of admissions prior to S1 was 2.5 (range 1-6) and 14 women received hospital treatment in the second trimester. Of the 32 women, 12 (38%) were treated with third-춍ine agents (systemic steroids). In comparison with women with a perceived milder form of the condition, the `severe HG' classification was not associated with significantly different EPDS scores at S1 (OR 1.0 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.09) or S2 (OR 1.0 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.09), nor did it affect the odds of having an EPDS 13 at S1 (OR 1.58, (0.64 to 3.87)) or at S2 (OR1.12 (0.34 to 3.62)) as shown in table 5.
In the PN questionnaire, 33% (18/55) of women in the case group reported their symptoms as having resolved before 20 weeks gestation and 67% (37/55) reported that their symptoms continued beyond 20 weeks gestation, of whom 20 women (36% of all cases) reported that symptoms continued throughout pregnancy. At S1, there was no significant association between the EPDS scores in these two groups. At S2, a difference between the number of women with symptoms beyond 20 weeks did not reach clinical significance in this sample size (OR 2.1 (0.66 to 1.11)), (online supplemental data 1).

In the secondary analysis on infant bonding, we did not
find a direct effect of HG on infant bonding. Probable depression (EPDS of 13)33 was associated with infant bonding. At S1 (AN data), 27% (40/157) women in the study population had an EPDS 13. At S2 (PN data), 19% (21/111) women had an EPDS of 13. As shown in figure 4, women with an EPDS of 13 at S1 and S2 had higher Maternal-t춐-쵪nfant Bonding Scale scores at 6
weeks postdelivery, indicating a negative impact of probable depression on infant bonding.33 35 At S1, 37 of the 40 women (93%) with an EPDS score 13 were in the case group. At S2, 16 of the 21 women (76%) with an EPDS 13 were in the case group (online supplemental data 2).

DISCUSSION This paper uses validated questionnaire tools to assess the psychological impact of HG during and after pregnancy. We have produced statistically significant results from women suffering HG in pregnancy in both the AN and PN periods demonstrating the lasting effect of HG on mental health and highlighting it as a risk factor for both AN and PN depression. Additionally, for the first time, we have assessed infant bonding in the PN period and used a specifically designed questionnaire to assess the psychosocial implications of HG, including the socioeconomic consequences to women and their families. This study therefore supports the idea that the true

impact of HG is currently not appreciated by healthcare professionals.14
The magnitude of association between HG and depression is concerning. We identified probable depression in 49% of the case group at S1 (antenatally) and 29% at S2 (postnatally); both significantly higher rates compared with women who did not suffer with significant NVP in pregnancy. Seven women in the case group reported significant thoughts of self-춉arm and were urgently referred on to the local perinatal psychiatry team. Our study findings are in keeping with the few others that have assessed psychological sequalae of HG in the PN period. Kames-쵮jelgaard et al38 assessed psychological well-춂eing in women with HG both antenatally and postnatally. They specifically assessed emotional distress in a large Norwegian population, as part of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study.38 Emotional distress was assessed using the Hopkins SCL-5 at two AN points (17 and 32 weeks gestation) and two PN points (6 and 18 months postpartum). Over 800 women in the cohort were classified as having HG. This aspect of the study found that women with HG had a higher ratio of emotional distress at both AN points and at 6 months PN but this difference was not evident at 18 months postpartum.38 HG has also been associated with PTSD in studies assessing women who had suffered with HG during pregnancy following delivery. Christodoulou-쵹mith et al39 recruited women who had suffered with HG during pregnancy via a support website and asked them to complete a questionnaire in the PN period assessing the three categories of PTSD; re-춅xperiencing, avoidance and hyper-춁rousal.39 18% (68/377) fulfilled the full criteria for PTSD. A further study by

Magtira et al28 looked at recurrence rates of HG in women who reported symptoms of PTSD following their initial pregnancy affected by HG and thus indirectly reported on the rate of PTSD in women suffering HG. In keeping with the Christodoulou-S mith, up to 18% of women with HG fulfilled the full criteria for PTSD.28 39
Two other studies have assessed psychological morbidity during pregnancy with two-p oint data collection (both AN) with differing conclusions.13 40 Tan et al found that women with HG demonstrated a `very strong rebound in psychological wellbeing after physical recovery'.40 Conversely, Poursharif et al13 found that the psychological fall out from HG was long lasting and indeed still evident in the PN period with women quoting that they were unable to `forget how sick they were' and many women adamant that they would or could not have a further pregnancy due to their experience. With our two- point assessment, we have been able to demonstrate that, although many women recover from AN depression associated with HG, some continue to experience symptoms of depression in the PN period. Psychological morbidity continuing into the PN period does not seem to relate to measures of severity of symptoms during pregnancy as measured by factors such as the need for third-l춊ne treatments or repeated admissions. HG is widely considered a complication of early pregnancy and it is an interesting finding that one third of women reported symptoms throughout pregnancy. Although it may seem logical that women facing a longer duration of illness suffer greater psychological fallout, unfortunately the small numbers in this subgroup meant we were not able to assess this hypothesis.

Depression during and after pregnancy has important potential implications for women in terms of quality of life, social functioning, relationship problems and indeed risk of suicide.41 42 Eight women in the case group recruited to the study with an initially wanted pregnancy went on to undergo a termination of pregnancy prior to the first survey at 12 weeks gestation. Although it is not known if this was directly related to HG, it must be considered as a possible factor. A joint report, published by Pregnancy Sickness Support and BPAS (British Pregnancy Advisory Service) in 2015, estimated that around 10% of women with HG terminate otherwise wanted pregnancies due to the physical, emotional/psychological, psychosocial and financial burden of the disorder.43
In the postpartum period, psychological health is associated with dysfunctional parenting and subsequently child development and behavioural issues.42 44 45 The effect of perinatal depression on women and their offspring can be reduced if the condition is identified and treated early.46 Symptoms of HG typically start at 6-8 weeks with the greatest number of hospital admissions before 8 weeks.47 48 Routine AN care generally starts later in the first trimester when psychological morbidity in women with HG is already evident as demonstrated in this study. Given the established association between HG and perinatal psychological morbidity, screening of women with symptoms of severe nausea and vomiting at time of hospital treatment and consideration of early referral to perinatal services is recommended.9 12 13

Of the 45 women with an EPDS score of 13 at S1, 25 (63%) saw a healthcare professional regarding mental health symptoms during pregnancy. However, only five women accessed the perinatal mental health team or reported having seen a counsellor and/or psychiatrist during pregnancy. On further review of patient records, all of these five women had been directly referred by the research team due to thoughts of self-춉arm identified at S1. The remaining 20 women reported discussing their mental health concerns with their GP and/or a midwife. Multidisciplinary perinatal services are widely in place but we found that women in our study with HG and associated mental health symptoms did not access them without prompting. This is likely to be multifactorial, related to awareness of the psychological implications of HG among healthcare professionals and indeed patients themselves not being aware or informed that help and support is available to them.10 12 13
A small number of studies have address the non- physical burden of HG including effect on quality of life, self-춅steem, marital disharmony and financial difficulties.15 16 30 39 In our case group, the social and socioeconomic consequences were evident. Over 50% of employed women in the case group needed to take >4 weeks off work during pregnancy compared with 2% in the control group (OR 60.57 (8.43 to 2535.63)). All participants who reported they were not working had at least one child under the age of 5 for whom they were the primary carer. In addition to the implications of taking long-춗erm sick

leave from paid employment, this highlights the social burden of HG on families where women suffering from the condition are primary care givers to other children.
PN infant bonding has never previously been studied in relation to HG and this study provides initial evidence that HG does not directly affect infant bonding in the PN period. One previous study by McCormack et al18 assessed fetal attachment in the AN period only. They conducted a case-control survey during pregnancy using the Maternal-쵧etal Attachment Scale18 at two AN points. They found that at the early assessment (7-16 weeks) there was a small negative effect on the level of fetal attachment felt by women with HG but that at the second assessment (after 26/40), when symptoms were considered to have resolved, there was no difference in reported maternal-춆etal attachment.18 In our assessment of PN infant bonding, we did not find any direct relationship between HG and Maternal-t춐-쵪nfant Bonding Scale scores. However, we did find that women with probable depression (EPDS score 13) had a significantly higher Maternal-춗o-쵪nfant Bonding Scale scores indicating that depression has a negative effect on infant bonding. This indicated a possible indirect relationship between HG and infant bonding, given the significant association between HG and depression shown in this study. There were no differences between the two groups in factors which may have affected Maternal-t춐-쵪nfant Bonding Scores; the number of women with significant AN complication was similar (p=0.264), as was unexpected admission of the baby to the neonatal unit (p=0.592).
Study limitations The gold standard for diagnosis of depression is one- to-춐ne psychological assessment, though this usually correlates with small population studies, limiting the power of any relationship identified. This survey study was based on self-s춅lection of participants. This could mean that those worst affected do not participate and the

conclusions are therefore underestimated or, conversely, the worst affected more readily participate and the findings are overestimated. Due to a change in eligibility status, the AN survey was completed by 20 more case group participants and 14 more control group participants and hence the results of this component hold greater power compared with the PN questionnaire. At both data collection points, numbers met the power calculation requirement to identify any significant difference in results.
Ten women recruited as controls were excluded from the study prior to S1 as they reported or identified on hospital records to have presented with increased symptoms of NVP. This meant their PUQE score was no longer 6 making them ineligible for the control group. Two of these women presented to secondary care (accident and emergency) and the other eight contacted the research team directly. None required admission (inpatient or outpatient care). The concept of excluding these women was to create a clear comparison between women with significant NVP/ HG and controls without significant NVP (PUQE 6). However, by excluding these women, it is accepted there is a certain degree of loss of validity of the findings, resulting in a possible inflation of the effect of HG.
Response rates of eligible women were good in both groups at both survey points 1 and 2 which reduces this level of bias, as did consecutive recruitment. A caveat to this is that the response rates shown for S2 are slightly misleading as they demonstrate the percentage response for eligible women only. Women who did not respond to S1 were considered as ineligible for S2 hence the response rate for S2 may be seen as somewhat misleading. In reality, the response rate for S2 is likely lower. Despite this, adequate numbers were achieved to generate statistically significant results in line with the initial power calculation.
Unfortunately, due to availability of accredited researchers, we were only able to recruit control group patients from one hospital (Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London). This creates potential bias in terms of the population characteristics. However, all three hospitals are based within a 3-춎ile radius and serve a similar West London demographic which may reduce this potential bias.
Within the two study groups, there were significant differences in several background social variables (age, ethnicity, gestation at recruitment, relationship status, accommodation status and education status) which represent potential confounding factors in development of AN and/or PN depression. Relationship status, lack of social support and poor sociodemographic status have all been associated with AN and PN depression.41 49 50 Unfortunately, due to sample size, it was not possible to run a multivariable regression to adjust for these variables. Hence, we can only speculate if and to what extent these factors played a role in development of psychological morbidity. Based on data at recruitment, there was no difference in self-춓eported past psychological morbidity between the case and control groups nor was there a difference in women not eligible due to current mental

health issues. Despite this, it is recognised that pregnancy and parenthood represents a `life event' where psychological well-춂eing may be affected by social variables. The difference in gestation at recruitment occurs as the HG group were recruited at the time of admission (usually under 12 weeks gestation) for treatment which was generally earlier than the control group who were recruited at a low risk AN midwifery booking clinic where women were seen routinely towards the end of the first trimester.
CONCLUSIONS This two-p춐int survey prospective, multicentre case- control study has demonstrated a clear relationship between HG and depression in both the AN and PN periods, indicating a lasting effect on psychological well- being as a result of suffering HG during pregnancy. PN infant bonding was studied for the first time in relation to HG. Although there did not appear to be any direct relationship between HG and infant bonding, there was a possible indirect effect with women suffering probable depression bonding less well with their babies. The PN questionnaire identified a number of psychosocial implications of HG, most notably that over 50% of employed women who suffered HG required four or more weeks off work during pregnancy, highlighting major socioeconomic implications of the condition. It was noted that, in the AN period, women were not being referred to or accessing specialist perinatal mental health resources. The psychological, psychosocial and economic implications of HG should be considered when caring for women with this evidently debilitating condition. We recommend revision of clinical guidelines to emphasise aspects of care which extend beyond management of physical symptoms, including early psychological assessment and specialist intervention with the aim to prevent some of the significant psychological and psychosocial morbidity identified during this study.

Key Clinical Message It is important to recognize drug-induced vasculitis as patients with true vasculitis often require immunosuppressive therapy and delay in treatment can result in significant mortality. Illicit drug use (specifically methamphetamine and cocaine) should be in the differential diagnosis of vasculitis as it typically resolves with cessation of the drug.
KEYWORDS acute kidney injury, methamphetamine, renal biopsy, vasculitis

1 | QUIZ QUESTION: IS THERE A
LINK BETWEEN PATIENT'S URINE DRUG SCREEN AND RENAL BIOPSY FINDINGS?
A 38-year-old man presented with generalized weakness and epigastric pain. Examination revealed several pustules and purpuric spots on his legs, which he attributed to insect bites. Urine drug screen was positive for amphetamines and serum creatinine was 1.4 mg/dL. He soon developed sepsis with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis. Serum creatine kinase was within normal limits. Viral hepatitis and HIV testing, and vasculitis work up including antinuclear antibodies,

antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and cryoglobulins were negative. Skin biopsy showed evidence of mild vascular damage with swollen endothelial cells and infiltrate of neutrophils, eosinophils suggesting vasculitis. Renal biopsy demonstrated acute tubular injury and transmural fibroid necrosis without significant neutrophilic infiltrate in a medium-sized vessel and 2 branch vessels suggestive of subacute vasculitis (Figure 1), likely related to drug abuse. Patient's renal function gradually improved during the course of hospitalization and was taken off dialysis.
Methamphetamine is a synthetic drug that is widely abused by young adults and can have deleterious effects on many organ systems including the kidney.While rhabdomyolysis is the commonest mechanism of kidney injury,

Objective Clinically, consumptive coagulopathy, such as disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), is the most important among the common venomous snakebite complications owing to the serious hemorrhage risk associated with this condition. We evaluated the predictive value of the delta neutrophil index (DNI)--a new indicator for immature granulocytes--for DIC diagnosis.
Methods This retrospective observational study consecutively assessed adult patients with venomous snakebites for over 51 months. Patients were categorized into the no DIC and DIC groups. DNI values were measured within 24 hours after snakebite.
Results Thirty patients (26.3%) developed DIC. The DIC group had significantly higher median initial DNI than the no DIC group (0% vs. 0.2%, P<0.001). When the DIC group was divided into early and late groups (within and over 24 hours after snakebite, respectively), the DNI of the former was significantly higher than that of the latter and no DIC group. The late DIC group had significantly higher DNI than the no DIC group. Furthermore, DNI positively correlated with the DIC score (r=0.548, P<0.001). The initial DNI (odds ratio, 4.449; 95% confidence interval, 1.738 to 11.388; P=0.002) was an early DIC predictor. The area under the curve based on the initial DNI's receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.724.
Conclusion DNI values were significantly higher in the DIC group. Additionally, DNI was an early predictor of DIC development in patients with venomous snakebites in the emergency department.

What is already known Treatment strategies for venomous snakebites generally focus on resolving coagulation abnormalities. Clinically, consumptive coagulopathy, including disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), is the most important among the snakebite complications because it can result in severe and life-threatening hemorrhage.
What is new in the current study Delta neutrophil index values were significantly higher in the DIC group. Furthermore, delta neutrophil index was an early predictor for DIC development in patients with venomous snakebites in the emergency department.

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 421,000 venomous snakebites occur worldwide each year, resulting in 20,000 deaths. Four types of venomous snakes have been identified in Korea: Gloydius brevicaudus, Gloydius ussuriensis, and Gloydius intermedius from the family Viperidae and Rhabdophis tigrinus from the family Colubridae.1 In Korea, approximately 192 to 621 venomous snakebites are reported annually, which account for five deaths.2,3  The toxic manifestations of venomous snakebites include local tissue damage, such as soft tissue edema, necrosis, or chemically mediated inflammation, and major systemic complications, such as neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, and cytotoxicity. The treatment strategies for venomous snakebites generally focus on resolving coagulation abnormalities.4 Clinically, consumptive coagulopathy, including disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), is the most important among the snakebite complications because it can result in severe and life-threatening hemorrhage.5  Some reports have shown that the delta neutrophil index (DNI)--which is a new indicator for immature granulocytes and a commonly evaluated consumptive coagulopathy marker in sepsis--is associated with DIC in critically ill patients with suspected sepsis.6-8 The DNI is defined as the difference in leukocyte subfractions identified via a cytochemical myeloperoxidase reaction and nuclear lobularity assay and is measured using a blood cell analyzer (ADVIA 120; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA). It is strongly correlated with manual immature granulocyte counts, which are difficult to obtain in clinical practice because of the inaccuracy of manual counting.6,7,9-13 One advantage offered by the DNI is that the tests are simultaneously performed with routine complete blood count testing without additional cost.  We hypothesized that the initial DNI (measured within 24 hours after snakebite) might be higher in patients with DIC manifesting as consumptive coagulopathy in the case of a venomous

snakebite. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the differences in initial DNI in relation to the presence of DIC. Moreover, the usefulness of initial DNI as an early DIC predictor in patients with venomous snakebites was examined.
METHODS
Study subjects and setting This retrospective observational study included adults aged more than 18 years with venomous snakebite who were consecutively treated for over a 51-month period (from 2011 May to 2015 July) from the time when the DNI checks were implemented. In this study, the emergency department (ED) was located in a single urban, tertiary-care hospital, which has an annual visit volume of over 45,000 and is staffed 24 hours per day by board-certified emergency physicians.  All patients with the word "snake," "venomous," or "envenoming/envenomation" in the ED discharge codes registered in computerized hospital records were initially considered. The diagnostic criteria for venomous snakebite included one or more of the following: 1) a confirmed two-fang wound, 2) a bite from a snake with a triangular-shaped head, 3) venomous snakebite confirmation based on the patient's experience, and 4) presence of abnormal physical and laboratory findings, such as shock, tachypnea, bleeding, thrombocytopenia, DIC, or diplopia, despite other insufficient findings.14 Antivenin was administered when the patients had systemic signs, including collapse, convulsions, weakness, paralysis, respiratory failure, shock, or bleeding, or severe local symptoms associated with snakebite. The dose was repeated if the symptoms persisted.  The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors, glucocorticoids, or other immunosuppressants that could affect the DNI values; 2) presence of hematological abnormalities and evidence of wound infection, such as redness, localized heat sensation, or purulent discharge, and ma-

jor trauma that may influence the DNI values; 3) use of anticoagulants and presence of liver cirrhosis, which could affect the coagulation profiles, such as prothrombin time (PT); 4) presentation more than 24 hours after snakebite; 5) transfer of patient from other hospitals after antivenin use, which may exert effects on the DNI that could not be excluded; and 6) transfer of patient to another hospital regardless of ED admission or not.  Patients were categorized as having DIC or none. The DIC group included patients with consumptive coagulopathy through activation of the entire clotting pathway, such as DIC. We used a diagnostic algorithm for DIC that was proposed by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. The algorithm parameters include the platelet count ( > 100,000/킠 = 0, < 100,000/ 킠 = 1, < 50,000/킠 = 2); fibrin degradation product, such as ddimer (no increase= 0, moderate increase= 2, strong increase= 3); prolonged PT (< 3 sec= 0, > 3 sec= 1, > 6 sec= 2); and fibrinogen level (> 1.0 g/dL= 0, < 1.0 g/dL= 1). A score of 5 or higher is consistent with the presence of DIC, and this algorithm has been reported to have a sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 97%, respectively, for DIC diagnosis.15,16 We reclassified patients with DIC into early DIC (DIC within 24 hours after snakebite) and late DIC (DIC beyond 24 hours after snakebite) groups.
Data collection The data were collected through a retrospective review of the patients' electronic medical records by two emergency physicians who were blinded to the study objectives and hypothesis. The abstractors were blinded to the patient group categorization, which was accomplished by another emergency physician. Additionally, the abstractors were trained prior to data collection to reduce the possible bias from the data collection procedure. We used explicit case report forms. The chart abstractors and study coordinators periodically met to resolve any disputes and review coding rules. The study coordinators monitored the abstractors' performance. Considering that the study was performed retrospectively and observationally, the patients' records and information were anonymously processed prior to analysis. The following information was obtained from the medical records: age, sex, site of the bite,

time from snakebite to ED arrival, underlying diseases, initial systolic blood pressure, severity as determined by a traditional snakebite severity grading scale (Table 1),17 antivenin use, and initial symptoms and signs, including both local and systemic manifestations. Systemic complications, including hematological (anemia,18 thrombocytopenia, PT/partial thrombin time [PTT] prolongation, and bleeding), neurological (blurred vision, diplopia, and dizziness), and other complications (rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury [AKI],19,20 and shock [systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg]), occurring during hospitalization were investigated.  Blood samples for the analyses of serum white blood cell (WBC) counts, C-reactive protein levels, DNI, platelet counts, and fibrinogen, PT, PTT, d-dimer, and antithrombin III levels were obtained through venipuncture within the first hour of ED admission. An automatic cell analyzer (ADVIA 120/2120, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics) was used to measure the DNI. The technique is specific to the technology found in the ADVIA unit manufactured by Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics. This flow cytometry-based hematological analyzer utilizes two independent WBC analysis methods by using myeloperoxidase and lobularity/nuclear density channels. The DNI was calculated in leukocyte differentials using the following formula: DNI = (leukocyte subfraction assayed in the myeloperoxidase channel via cytochemical reaction) - (leukocyte subfraction counted in the nuclear lobularity channel via reflected light beam).7,12,13  The primary outcome of this study was the difference in the initial DNI measured in the ED in relation to the presence of DIC in patients with venomous snakebites. The secondary outcome was the predictive ability of the initial DNI on the presence of DIC upon presentation at the ED. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our medical college (CR316051). The informed consent was waived due to retrospective design.
Statistical analysis Categorical variables are presented as frequencies and percentages, whereas continuous variables are presented as means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges. Chisquare or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare categorical

variables, whereas two-sample t-tests or Mann-Whitney U-tests were utilized to compare continuous variables. To compare three groups, we performed the chi-square test (Fisher exact test), analysis of variance, or Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate. We also analyzed multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction, Sheff's method, and Dunn's procedure, as appropriate. Normality was first assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Correlation coefficients (r) were calculated via the Spearman's method. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors that predicted the presence of DIC. The results were expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was utilized to evaluate the DNI's predictive ability in classifying DIC. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and all statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

RESULTS
Patient characteristics A total of 170 patients with venomous snakebites were consecutively assessed during the study period. Among these patients, 56 were excluded based on the following criteria: ED arrival with wound infection (one patient), presentation beyond 24 hours following bite (20 patients), transferred from other hospital after antivenin use (20 patients), transferred to other hospital regardless of ED admission or not (six patients), discharged against medical advice (two patients), and insufficient data (seven patients). After exclusion, we included a total of 114 patients with venomous snakebites.  Of the 114 analyzed patients, 76 (66.7%) were men with a median age of 56 years (range, 18 to 93 years). The median time from snakebite to ED arrival was 3 hours. Hypertension (28 patients, 25.7%) was the most common underlying disease. Patients with bite severity grade of II (56 patients, 50.5%) were most com-

Patients in the no DIC and DIC groups differed significantly in the proportion of males (57.1% vs. 93.3%, P< 0.001). The DIC group had significantly longer time from snakebite to ED arrival than the no DIC group (5.0 vs. 2.0 hours, P= 0.002). Furthermore, the DIC group had significantly higher final bite severity (P< 0.001) and more frequent multidose antivenin administrations (P < 0.001) than the no DIC group. All hematological complications, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, PT/PTT prolongation, and bleeding, were significantly more common in the DIC group than in the no DIC group. However, no significant differences in neurological complications were observed between the two groups. Patients with DIC had significantly higher rhab-

domyolysis and AKI incidences than those with no DIC (P= 0.033 and 0.019, respectively).  The DIC group had significantly higher median initial serum WBC and DNI values than the no DIC group (7,635 vs. 9,800, P = 0.017; 0 vs. 0.2, P < 0.001, respectively). The initial serum Creactive protein levels did not differ significantly between groups. When the DIC group was divided into the early and late groups, the mean DNI value of the former was significantly higher than that of the latter and no DIC group. The late DIC group had significantly higher DNI values than the no DIC group. Additionally, the early DIC group has significantly higher WBC counts than the no DIC group (Table 4 and Fig. 1). DNI was positively correlated with DIC score (r= 0.548, P< 0.001).  Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the early predictors related to DIC development, such as male sex, time from snakebite to ED arrival, serum WBC, and DNI. Male sex (OR, 5.785; 95% CI, 1.155 to 28.964; P = 0.033), time from snakebite to ED arrival (OR, 1.110; 95% CI, 1.036 to 1.189; P = 0.003), and initial DNI (OR, 4.449; 95% CI, 1.738 to 11.388; P= 0.002) were found to be statistically associated with DIC development. The area under the curve based on the initial DNI's receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.724 (Table 5 and Fig. 2).
DISCUSSION
In this study, the initial DNI (measured within 24 hours after snakebite) was significantly higher in the DIC group, and the DNI was positively correlated with the DIC score. Additionally, the initial DNI was a significant early predictor of DIC development. Our findings may be explained by the following: 1) during stress, inflammation, or infection, immature granulocytes enter the circulation.10,21 Therefore, venomous snakebites can cause increased DNI, which is strongly correlated with increased manual immature granulocyte counts. This finding can be attributed to the inflammatory reaction caused by envenomation, which is the major characteristic feature of bites from viperine species.22,23 2) Both the venomous toxin itself and the inflammatory reaction caused by viperine envenomation can cause DIC. The inflammatory reac-

tion may contribute to more severe DIC development than the toxin itself. 3) DNI is associated with hypercoagulable states, such as DIC. Based on the reports on sepsis, DNI was closely related to the presence of DIC, which is one of the sepsis complications. Furthermore, Nahm et al.7 and Park et al.8 suggested that DNI might be linked to a hypercoagulable state associated with sepsis. We thought that the hypercoagulable state caused by venomous snakebites might be related to DNI elevation, similar to sepsis. Therefore, increased DNI may not only develop due to venomous snakebites but may also be significantly higher in the DIC group. Thus, DNI can be correlated with DIC score.  However, some venomous toxins, such as thrombin-like enzymes (TLEs) or fibrinogenases, can result in consumptive coagulopathy with low fibrinogen levels but normal levels of other clotting factors, unlike DIC. This finding may be attributed to the cleaving property of either the - or -chains of fibrinogen that transforms into fibrinopeptide A or B, resulting in fibrinogen consumption without fibrin formation.24,25 Therefore, we could not assess the occurrence of consumptive coagulopathy by measuring the TLE or fibrinogenase levels using the DIC algorithm, although no information is available on the ratio of consumptive coagulopathy caused by TLEs or fibrinogenases among all cases of consumptive coagulopathy resulting from venomous snakebites in Korea.  In this study, the hematological complication prevalence (58 patients, 50.9%) was similar to that reported in previous studies (7% to 82.4%).26-28 The time from snakebite to ED arrival was

81

significantly higher in the DIC group and was related to DIC development. This difference may be caused by the delay in management, such as antivenin administration, after venomous snakebites that could allow the condition to progress. Therefore, DIC should be suspected in patients arriving at the ED later than a few hours after venomous snakebites. The DIC group had higher bite severity and antivenin use than the no DIC group. This finding suggests that patients with systemic reactions, for example, hematological complications, including DIC, naturally have a high bite severity. Similarly, antivenin is used more often in patients with systemic reactions, such as hematological complications. Sex-specific differences between the two groups could not be explained. In this study, men and women did not differ significantly in terms of age, time from snakebite to ED arrival, and bite severity (data not shown). However, men had longer median time from snakebite to ED arrival than women did, although the difference was not significant (3.0 vs. 1.8 hours, P = 0.101). These variations may contribute to differences in the DIC development. Serum WBC count was not a predictor of DIC development, although it significantly differed between the no DIC and DIC groups.  This study had several limitations. First, it was constrained by its retrospective design and missing data, including the type of venomous snakes, during collection. Second, the sample size was possibly small because this study was conducted at the emergency center of a single hospital. However, we investigated all patients with venomous snakebites from the time when the DNI levels were measured, starting in May 2011, to reduce this possible bias. Third, we could not assess the presence of consumptive coagulopathy by measuring the TLE or fibrinogenase levels based on the DIC algorithm.25 Finally, we could not determine the direct relationship between DNI and consumptive coagulopathy because of the influence of the toxin itself on the DNI values. A well-designed prospective study is necessary to overcome these limitations.  In summary, DNI values were significantly higher in the DIC group. Moreover, DNI served as an early predictor of DIC development in patients with venomous snakebites in the ED.

Purpose: The aim of the study was to assess preferences and attitudes toward the use of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs among residents of Bialystok aged 60 or older. Patients and methods: The study included 170 people, inhabitants of Bialystok aged over 60: 85 students of the University of a Healthy Senior and the University of Psychogeriatric Prophylaxis, and 85 students of the University of the Third Age in Bialystok. The study made use of a diagnostic survey conducted via a questionnaire prepared by the authors. Results: The vast majority of respondents bought OTC drugs for own use. About one-third of the respondents from each analyzed group bought OTC drugs less often than once every 3 months. Over half of the respondents bought OTC drugs due to a cold. A majority of the respondents were of the opinion that OTC drugs should be sold only in pharmacies. Over 40% of seniors took 1 OTC drug regularly. Most respondents also took vitamins and supplements. The main sources of information on OTC drugs for the studied seniors were their doctor and pharmacist. Respondents did not always consult the treatment method with a doctor or pharmacist. Over half of the respondents familiarized themselves with the contents of the OTC drug package leaflet. Over three-quarters of the respondents were familiar with drug disposal methods; however, despite declarations of being familiar with these principles, a significant percentage did not bring back medication to a pharmacy or clinic, or threw the drugs into the trash. Conclusion: Our study found that in our sample there were many OTC drug consumers who did not always demonstrate responsible attitudes toward using this group of drugs. Thus, older people should be educated on the possible adverse effects of taking OTC drugs without consulting a doctor or pharmacist as well as basic drug disposal principles. Furthermore, legislation should be introduced that will limit the wide availability of OTC drugs, particularly to the elderly; and thus, lower the costs of hospitalization and outpatient treatment of this age group. Also, a wider-reaching study should be conducted. It should include a larger group of elderly people as well as information on intake of prescribed medications in order to be able to determine the frequency of drug consumption in this population, as well as seniors' preferences and attitudes in this regard. Keywords: elderly, geriatric pharmacology, nutritional supplements, polypharmacy, selfmedication, vitamins
Introduction
An aging population is a major social and health problem to public health. It is estimated that by 2050, 80% of the population of middle-developed and low-developed countries will be more than 60 years old;1 while people aged 65 and over will account for more than 25% of Europe's population.2 It is estimated that by 2035 more than one-quarter

of Poland's citizens will be over 65, and in 2060 Poland's population will be one of the oldest societies in Europe.3
The high demand for drugs is closely linked to the aging population.4 A specific feature of older adults is an increasing trend in multimorbidity, which involves the presence of two or more chronic diseases.5 It is estimated that multimorbidity is present in 62% of people aged 65-74, and up to 81.5% of people over 85 years.6
Self-medication with over-the-counter (OTC) drugs is defined as the consumption by patients of drugs not prescribed by a doctor for the treatment of untreated or unrecognized conditions.7 In recent years, a high intake of OTC drugs among older adults has been observed.8-12 Previous literature has shown that certain factors, such as female sex and higher education, are responsible for increased OTC drugs consumption.13 In addition, in the elderly, many diseases and chronic conditions are associated with the phenomenon of polypharmacy,14 which involves the consumption of more than five prescribed drugs. Consequently, polypharmacy is associated with OTC drugs use.15
On the pharmaceutical market there are nearly 100,000 OTC drugs. Their safe use depends largely on the ability of the consumers to properly understand and use OTC drugs, as well as prescription drugs.9 However, OTC drugs are a bit different because they do not require the doctor's permission to use them and thus impose more decision-making on them.16 Many hospitalizations and deaths among the elderly occur every year due to adverse drug events (ADEs) caused by drugs.16-19 Nonetheless, drug consumers often view OTC drugs as less risky and safer than prescription drugs.18 In particular, this applies to older adults. When reading informational leaflets on OTC drugs, consumers may often misunderstand the information that may contribute to the high number of adverse drug events occurring each year.16,18,19 Therefore, consumers of OTC drugs need sufficient health knowledge to reduce the risk of hazardous events due to the use of drugs that may result in death. Older people are particularly vulnerable to ADE risk due to aging factors.16 Currently, there is a risk of overuse of OTC drugs, especially analgesics, in the whole population, and especially among the elderly.20,21 These concerns lead to an assessment of the needs and outcomes of OTC drugs in different age groups, especially among older adults.
Patients' ability to "self-report" OTC drug use varies in the literature. Some studies have demonstrated a high level of understanding between self-reporting and other methods.22-24 Other studies have found less support for this practice.25 Pit et al26 showed that the accuracy and withdrawal

of self-medication depend on a multitude of factors, such as the length of the withdrawal period and the drug class. The benefits of self-reporting may include the use of OTC drugs and asking patients for information about the use of these drugs, which is often not possible with other methods such as databases for pharmaceutical claims or biochemicals measures.27
The aim of the study was to assess preferences and attitudes toward the use of OTC drugs among residents of Bialystok aged 60 or older. Furthermore, we decided to evaluate correlations between preferences and attitudes of older people toward the use of OTC drugs and the respondents' socio-demographic data (age, sex, group of origin).
Patients and methods Participants
The study was conducted in 2 groups:  Group I - students of the University of a Healthy Senior
(UHS) and the University of Psychogeriatric Prophylaxis (UPP) (85 people, including 67 women (78.82%) and 18 men (21.18%)), carried out at the Faculty of Health Sciences of the Medical University of Bialystok. The UHS was established in October 2013. Its main objectives include: promoting healthy lifestyle and healthy attitudes, expanding knowledge in the field of medical care improving the quality of life of older people, the use of modern methods of diagnostics and treatment, as well as the use of medications and dietary supplements, and pharmacoeconomics in diseases of older people; prevention of loneliness and social activation of older people. The curriculum of UHS is based on three main pillars: lectures, practical classes (exercises), and optional activities. Due to the large interest in the continuation of education and further broadening of knowledge of health of seniors, and in response to the needs of older inhabitants of Bialystok, the second stage of health education, the UPP, was inaugurated in the academic year 2015/2016. The key objectives of the project include promotion of a healthy lifestyle and healthy attitudes from the mental aspect, extending knowledge in the field of medical care to improve the quality of life of older people with mental disorders, the use of modern methods of diagnosis and treatment, the use of drugs in mental diseases of older people, prevention of loneliness and social exclusion, and social activation of older people. The classes are carried out in the form of lectures, where the main groups of mental diseases of older people are discussed.

The use of over-the-counter drugs by older adults in Poland

 Group II - students of the University of the Third Age in Bialystok (UTA) (85 persons, including 63 women (74.12%) and 22 men (25.88%)), which aims at stimulating personal development, intellectual agility and physical fitness, social activation of older people, promotion of gerontological prophylaxis, and actions for the benefit of older people and the disabled. Classes at UTA are carried out in the form of: lectures, optional classes, and classes in sections and teams of interest. Currently UTA has the following sections: painting, embroidery, ballroom dancing, gymnastics, swimming, chess and bridge, peer assistance, table tennis, editorship, but also a choir and theatre, as well as foreign languages courses - English, German, French, and Esperanto. The study included 170 people in total, residents of
Bialystok, aged 60 and over: 130 women (76.47%) and 40 men (23.53%). In the group from UHS and UPP, the youngest respondent was 60 years old, while the oldest was 78. The median age was 67.22 years. Among the students of UTA, the median age was 65.72 years; the youngest respondent was 60, and the oldest 85. The median age of the whole study group was 66.47. In the study group, 80 people (47.05%) probably lived alone (UHS/UPP - n=43, 50.58%; UTA - n=37, 43.53%). The respondents' socio-demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Another criterion for inclusion in the study, besides age and place of residence, were the absence of cognitive impairments in the respondents and written consent for participation in the study. Each respondent could withdraw at any time.
Selection of the respondents was intentional. The authors assumed that at least 150 fully completed questionnaires would be collected, 75 from each study group. Finally, 170 full surveys were collected. A greater number of research tool copies were distributed, but not all of the questionnaires were returned to the authors. Eventually, the group of UHS and UPP students included 150 seniors (response rate - 56.67%), while the group of UTA students included 350 seniors (24.29%).
Measurements and procedure
The study was performed from April to July 2017. The study design was cross-sectional. We used the diagnostic survey method with a proprietary questionnaire consisting of 23 single-answer and multiple-choice closed questions. The questions pertained to socio-demographic characteristics (sex, age, marital status, place of residence, education, financial status), the method and frequency of OTC drug purchase, the amount of OTC drugs consumed, reasons

for taking OTC drugs, intake of nutritional supplements by respondents, factors affecting their decision to buy OTC drugs, sources of obtaining information on OTC drugs, as well as seniors' opinions and attitudes toward basic safety principles on proceeding with OTC drugs (reading drug information leaflets found in the package, taking the suggested drug dosage, familiarity with drug disposal methods, how to proceed with expired or unnecessary drugs, OTC drug points of sale). The purpose of the study was not analysis or history of adverse events, management of drug-related injuries or parameters of awareness of self-medication or OTC medication. The questionnaire content for all sections was guided by the literature, but where none existed, items were created by drawing on researcher experience.
Respondents received paper copies of the questionnaire, which they filled out at home after receiving detailed information from members of the study team.
Ethics
The Bioethics Committee of the Medical University of Bialystok approved this study (statute no R-I-002/35/2017); participants provided written informed consent.

Statistical analysis
Comparisons of two groups in terms of quantitative characteristics were done using Pearson's chi-square test and chi-square test with Yates correction. In the case of ordinal features, the U Mann-Whitney test was used. Statistical analysis was done with STATISTICA 12 software. Statistical significance was set at p,0.05.
Results Method of making decisions on purchasing OTC drugs
UHS/UPP students as well as people aged 71 and older most often bought OTC drugs for own use, without consulting a doctor. UTA students, both women and men, as well as people aged up to 70 most frequently made a decision to buy OTC drugs in connection with a doctor's recommendation. Detailed numerical data are presented in Table 2.
Characteristics of buying OTC drugs
Results pertaining to older people's preferences and attitudes toward buying OTC drugs are detailed in Table 3. The vast majority of respondents bought OTC drugs for own use. Almost all seniors bought OTC drugs in pharmacies. Statistical analysis indicated statistically significant differences between the UHS/UPP group and the UTA group and purchasing OTC drugs at grocery stores. About one-third of the elderly respondents from each analyzed group bought OTC drugs less frequently than once every 3 months. Over half of the respondents bought OTC drugs due to a cold. Subsequent reasons for buying OTC drugs by the elderly included muscle and joint pain as well as headaches. There was a statistically significant difference between those aged under 71 and those 71 years and older and purchase of OTC drugs due to cystitis. The most frequently indicated factors determining OTC drug purchase by the respondents included: the possibility to purchase right away, OTC drug effectiveness, and a pharmacist's

professional advice. Statistical analysis revealed statistically significant differences between the group of people under 71 and those over 71 years old and drug effectiveness as a factor determining OTC drug purchase. A majority of the respondents were of the opinion that OTC drugs should be sold only in pharmacies. We found statistically significant differences between UHS/UPP students and the UTA group, and the opinion that OTC drugs should be available only in pharmacies. Detailed results are presented in Table 3.
Number of OTC drugs taken as well as use of vitamins and supplements
The study results show that over 40% of the studied seniors, including over half of men, took 1 OTC drug regularly. In the studied group of 170 older people, 2 women under 71, who were UHS/UPP students, regularly took 10 or more OTC drugs. Most respondents also took vitamins and nutritional supplements (Table 4).
Sources of information on OTC drugs
The main sources of information on OTC drugs for the studied seniors were their doctor and pharmacist. UTA students, women, and those 71 or older preferred a doctor; while UHS/UPP students, men, and those under 71 preferred a pharmacist. Detailed information is presented in Table 5.
Respondents' preferences and attitudes on the safety of OTC drug use
The studied older people did not always consult the treatment method with a doctor or pharmacist. Their decision was dependent on the symptoms. Depending on symptom intensity, they either consulted the treatment method with a doctor or pharmacist, or made a decision on their own. It is worth emphasizing that half of the respondents aged 71 and over always consulted the treatment method with a doctor or pharmacist. Statistical analysis indicated a statistically

significant difference between people under 71 and those aged 71 and over, and consulting treatment method with a doctor or pharmacist. Over half of the respondents familiarized themselves with the contents of the OTC drug package leaflet every time. The vast majority of respondents agreed with the statement that using active substances in higher doses than recommended can pose an immediate threat to human life or health. Over three-quarters of respondents were familiar with drug disposal methods. UHS/UPP students, women, and those aged 71 and older had more knowledge on this topic.
We found a statistically significant difference between UHS/UPP and UTW students and familiarity with drug disposal methods, as well as between the studied women and men and familiarity with drug disposal methods. Similar differences between the aforementioned groups were demonstrated in the case of proceeding with expired or unnecessary drugs. UHS/UPP students, women, and those aged 71 and

older had more positive attitudes in this matter. Men and those under 71 years old sometimes returned drugs to a pharmacy or clinic. It is worth noting that despite declarations of being familiar with drug disposal principles, a significant percentage of respondents did not bring back medication to a pharmacy or clinic, or threw the drugs into the trash. Detailed results pertaining to the attitudes and preferences of older people in terms of drug use safety are presented in Table 6.
Discussion Average OTC drug intake, including vitamins and supplements
Despite widespread availability, OTC drugs can be both safe and effective if they are used correctly, that is according to a doctor's recommendations or as described in the package leaflet.28 According to Gallagher et al,29 elderly people consume on average 40% of the OTC drugs available on

the market. Vitamins and nutritional supplements are popular medical preparations in this group of drugs. In our study, 70% of respondents declared taking vitamins and supplements. The value we obtained in our study was relatively high compared with other international surveys. Among the 112 elderly people surveyed in the USA, half of the seniors declared herbal supplement intake. In the group of elderly people taking herbal products, 59% believed that consumption of these preparations in old age was safe.30 In a study by Yoon et al, 33% of 57 women had used one or more herbal products in the previous year.31 A Canadian study found that the highest frequency (57%) of vitamin and supplement intake was among women aged 50-65 years. Calcium, iron, B vitamins, and glucosamine32 were the most often supplemented.
In our study, 43% of seniors took 1 OTC drug regularly. An identical percentage of women aged 65 and over, studied by Yoon et al, took an average of 2.6 OTC drugs.33 Canter and Ernst conducted a study in a group of 271 elderly people in Great Britain; they found that the respondents took an average of 2.26 prescription drugs and 5.91 supplements and herbal products.34 In a study conducted among 1,206 elderly people, Levine et al35 determined that half (n=616, 51%) had taken one or more nutritional supplement in the previous year. Moen et al36 found that 38.4% of the studied respondents took one or more OTC drug, while 8.3% took one or more herbal supplement. In a population of elderly primary health care patients in Germany, the average OTC drug intake was 1.4 preparations.37 A study of 3,072 outpatients aged 75 and older in the USA found that 82.5% of the studied cohort took at least one nutritional supplement, and 54.5% 3 or more.38 In a study by Pannu et al,39 81.5% of the respondents took at least one natural health product and 64.2% at least one OTC drug. In the USA, almost half of the elderly population regularly takes at least one OTC drug or supplement.40 Gazibara et al41 demonstrated that in a total of 354 elderly people included in the study, 202 seniors (57.0%) stated taking OTC drugs in the previous month. Over half of the respondents (55.4%) took 1 OTC drug, and the remaining 44.6% up to 5.41 A study conducted among a group of 975 elderly American women indicated that 82.2% of them took OTC drugs, and the average number of preparations taken was 1.8.42 These data illustrate the fact that OTC drug intake in our studied sample was on the lower end, and thus suggests a lower risk of polypharmacy occurrence in the elderly population.
Reasons for OTC drug purchase
The most frequent reasons the elderly gave for buying OTC medications included colds, muscle and joint pain, as well

as headaches. Similar reasons for OTC drug purchase were indicated by Serbs - almost 40% of respondents bought an OTC drug to improve immunity and almost one-third for muscle and joint pain and headaches.41 These data point out that older people believe that OTC drugs improve health and eliminate unpleasant symptoms. In our study, as well as the aforementioned study conducted among seniors in Serbia, OTC drugs were mostly bought in pharmacies.41 Despite the wide availability of this group of drugs, elderly people generally decide to buy them from professionals.
OTC drug intake and sex
The obtained results prove that men were characterized by slightly lower intake of OTC drugs than women. Thus, they confirm trends described in previous studies;32,41,43-45 although our own research did not reveal such significant differences as previously published studies. Qato et al40 obtained similar results, in which women more often than men took nutritional supplements; however, general OTC drug intake was similar for both sexes (41.9% for women and 42.6% for men). It is worth noting that in our study the percentage of participating men (21.2%) was significantly lower than the percentage of participating women (78.8%), which is the result of overrepresentation of elderly women compared with men in Poland. The higher OTC drug intake among women could also be caused by the fact that they might be supplementing certain minerals in accordance with a doctor's indications and principles of public health policy. Furthermore, women's more frequent visits in pharmacies and other OTC drug selling points may be determining factors in the higher intake in this group.
Pharmacist as a source of information on OTC drugs
Pharmacists are the best experts on OTC drug administration. Over 47% of respondents treated pharmacists as the main source of information on OTC medications. A similar percentage regularly consulted the treatment method with a doctor or pharmacist - it is worth noting that this percentage could and should be higher. This could be partially caused by older persons' belief that pharmacists are primarily responsible for all matters pertaining to prescribed medications, and not dispensing health advice and recommendations for OTC drugs and nutritional supplements.46
Limitations of the study
The conducted study had certain limitations. The study group was too small to be able to refer the results to the whole country. Respondents did not undergo an examination,

nor were they asked in the questionnaire about drugs prescribed by a doctor or chronic diseases. In the future, a widerreaching study should be conducted, in which a bigger group of elderly people will be included, and which will also include history-taking on chronic diseases and taken prescription drugs, so that the obtained results could be representative for the elderly population in Poland.
Conclusion
Our study found that in our sample there were many OTC drug consumers who did not always demonstrate responsible attitudes toward using this group of drugs. Thus, older people should be educated on the possible adverse effects of taking OTC drugs without consulting a doctor or pharmacist as well as basic drug disposal principles. Furthermore, legislation should be introduced that will limit the wide availability of OTC drugs, particularly to the elderly; and thus, lower the costs of hospitalization and outpatient treatment of this age group. Also, a wider-reaching study should be conducted. It should include a larger group of elderly people as well as information on intake of prescribed medications in order to be able to determine the frequency of drug consumption in this population, as well as seniors' preferences and attitudes in this regard.

@ihcams.ac.cn Abstract Objective To construct the BCMA-CAR using the B-cell maturation antigenBCMA
specific ligand APRIL as antigen binding region and to validate the effect of BCMA-CAR modified T cells BCMA- CAR- T on myeloma cells. Methods The BCMA- CAR was constructed using the BCMA
specific ligand APRIL as antigen binding domain and 4- 1BB as the costimulatory domain. The specific cytotoxicity against BCMA+ myeloma cell lines and primary multiple myelomaMMcells in vitro were evaluated. In addition, BCMA+ myeloma xenograft mouse model was established to assess the anti-tumor
effect of BCMA- CAR- T cell therapy in vivo. Results BCMA- CAR- T cells could specifically kill BCMA + myeloma cell linesFor BCMA- CAR- T cells, BCMA + cells are almost undetectable in the ET ratio of 14and MM patients'bone marrow mononuclear cellsthe proportion of residual cells in BCMACAR-T and vector-T groups was 16.0 vs 66.85, P0.003with significant degranulationCAR-T and vector- T cells cocultured with MM1.S, H929 and U266 had degranulation levels of 33.30 vs 5.62 , 16.97 vs 2.95 and 25.87 vs 2.97 , respectively, P0.001and cytokines releaseP0.01in vitro. In a human BCMA + myeloma xenograft mouse model, BCMA- CAR- T cells could significantly prolong the survival of miceThe median survival time of mice treated with BCMA-CAR-T and vector-T

Clinical Observation
High prevalence of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in seven Chinese patients with cystathionine b-synthase deficiency

Homocystinuria due to cystathionin-b-synthase (CBS) deficiency is a rare genetic disease that most often diagnosed in childhood and can cause damage to the multiple systems.[1,2] The inherited mode of CBS gene deficiency is usually autosomal recessive inheritance. More than 160 mutations have been identified in CBS genes so far (http://cbs.lf1.cuni.cz/index.php), one of the most common mutations is c.833T>C point mutation, and then followed by c.572C>T, c.919G>A, and c.1006C>T point mutations. In 2018, Li et al[2] found eight brand new mutation sites in patients with CBS deficiency in China, pointing out that the CBS mutant site spectrum of Chinese people is significantly different from that of other races. In this paper, we further conducted a retrospective analysis of seven homocystinuric patients of CBS deficiency admitted to our institute.
Data of seven patients with CBS deficiency from five Chinese families were collected from July 2016 to July 2019. Patients 1 and 2 are siblings, and patients 3 and 4 are siblings, while the other three patients (patients 5-7) are unrelated. Five patients (1, 3, 5-7) visited our hospital because of vascular events. Patients 2 and 4 were detected by family screening. The DNA samples of the proband were sequenced by the second-generation sequencing using the targeted capture strategy. The pathogenicity of the suspected mutation sites were preliminarily analyzed and identified. Then Sanger sequencing was used to verify these loci. Finally, family screening was carried out with Sanger sequencing in all their patients and affected siblings.
All patients were treated with three B vitamins (including mecobalamine: 0.5-1.5 mg/day, Folic acid tablets: 5-15 mg/day, Vitamin B6: 30-60 mg/day) once severe hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY) is diagnosed. If homocystinuria

with CBS deficiency was determined and plasma homocysteine (Hcy) did not get back to normal, pyridoxine responsiveness would be further determined by measuring plasma Hcy after oral administration of B6 (300-600 mg/ day) for at least 2 weeks. Pyridoxine responders were regarded as those with a decrease of plasma Hcy level to below 50 mmol/L; patients with no or little decrease were regarded as non-responsive. For pyridoxine non-responsive patients, betaine supplementation (3-6 g/day) and low-methionine diet was advised. All patients were followed up regularly after discharge, and the median time of follow-up was 16 months (6-36 months). Followup neuroimaging (including either gadolinium enhancedmagnetic resonance venography or computed tomography venography) was performed in five patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).
As shown in Table 1, five patients (1, 3, 5-7) were revealed with multiple thrombus in the intracranial venous sinus, with secondary epilepsy in three patients (1, 3, and 6). Two patients (5 and 7) had no symptoms typical for CBS deficiency other than vascular disorders at the time of diagnosis, while other five patients (1-4, 6) had multisystem damage, with eye disorders to be the common presentation. All seven patients had significantly increased plasma total Hcy (48-242 mmol/L) and decreased plasma levels of Vitamin B12 (below 50 pg/mL) and folic acid (below 1 ng/mL). The plasma methionine was significantly increased in seven patients (127-438 mmol/L) except one unavailable data in patient 5. Urine organic acid screening of all patients showed no abnormality. The secondgeneration sequencing results revealed a considerable genetic heterogeneity and identified eight mutations in CBS gene in seven Chinese patients with CBS deficiency [Table 1]. As in other populations, the most common CBS

The normal ranges of plasma Hcy, Met, vitamin B12, and folic acid were 0 to 15 mmol/L, 8 to 50 mmol/L, 180 to 900 pg/mL, >2.35 ng/mL, respectively. Pyridoxine responsiveness was determined by measuring plasma Hcy after oral administration of B6 (300-600 mg/day) for at least 2 weeks. Hcy: Homocysteine; Met: Methionine; MTHFR: Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; CVST: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis; AT: Atrial thrombosis; +: Responsive, plasma Hcy level decreased below 50 mmol/L; -: Non-responsive, Hcy levels almost unchanged, remain above 50 mmol/L.

mutation c.833T>C (p.I278T) was present in two patients (5 and 7) and homozygous mutations of c.833T>C was present in patient 5. The CBS gene mutations were compound heterozygous mutations in six patients, with three mutations (c.949A>G, c.407T>C, and c.551T>C) of them only reported in Chinese populations. The family analysis showed that their parents were all carriers of single mutation.
After nearly 1 month of treatment with oral mecobalamin, vitamin B6 and folic acid tablets, the plasma Hcy of two patients (patients 5 and 7) decreased close to normal, while the plasma Hcy of other five patients remained higher than 50 mmol/L. After increasing the dose of vitamin B6 to 300 to 600 mg/day, the plasma Hcy of two patients (3 and 4) decreased significantly to below 50 mmol/L in about 2 weeks, suggesting responsive to vitamin B6 treatment. However, the plasma Hcy levels of three patients (1, 2, and 6) were still above 100 mmol/L, which did not go down obviously after about 6 months of betaine supplementation and low-methionine diet. For five patients with CVST, follow-up neuroimaging showed venous sinus thrombosis improved greatly, though did not return to completely normal after several months of anticoagulant treatment. A median time of follow-up for 16 months showed that none of these venous sinus thrombosis relapsed. However, patient 4 died of hemorrhagic stroke 2 years later, which may be related to her poor adherence to medication and abnormality in psychological state.
Previous reports have shown that the prevalence of thrombotic complications in patients with CBS deficiency varies from 23% to 42%, and it increases with age.[3] Our data revealed that CVST was the most prominent clinical feature for five homocystinuric patients, which reminded

us to pay more attention to CBS deficiency in routine thrombophilia screening in Chinese population. CBS deficiency can present as multi-system damage, including mental retardation, lens dislocation, osteoporosis, marfanoid syndrome, and thrombotic vascular disease.[2] Generally, the first symptom of most patients with CBS deficiency is congenital lens dislocation, but it is easily overlooked due to its variety of clinical manifestations and lack of specificity. In this group, eye disorders was the initial presentation for five patients in their childhood. Unfortunately, none of them were timely diagnosed. Our data revealed that both patients (5 and 7) with CVST to be the sole clinical feature had the mutation c.833T>C and were pyridoxine responsive, consistent with previous reports that CBS deficient patients with vascular events to be sole clinical complication tend to manifests at greater ages, have a high ratio of pyridoxine responsiveness/nonresponsiveness, and the mutation c.833T>C is often present,[3] in contrast with patients with multi-system damage typical for CBS deficiency. Once CBS deficiency is diagnosed, B vitamins should be used for treatment as soon as possible, so as to reduce significantly the cardiovascular risk.[3] Studies have shown that about half of CBS deficient patients were responsive to treatment with pyridoxal phosphate,[3] and the treatment effect of pyridoxal phosphate is closely related to the mutation site of CBS. For example, mutation sites such as c.833T>C and c.1006 C>T are usually responsive for pyridoxal phosphate treatment. However, mutation sites such as c.919G>A usually do not respond to the treatment of pyridoxal phosphate, so it is necessary to use betaine and/or follow low-methionine diet. In this study, the plasma Hcy levels of three patients (1, 2, and 6) were still above 50 mmol/L in spite of the supplement of vitamins B and the commencement of low-methionine diet, suggesting resistance to

pyridoxal phosphate treatment. In addition, we identified three mutations (c.949A>G, c.407 T>C, and c.551T>C) that were only reported in Chinese populations,[2] revealing that two mutations sites (c.949A>G and c.551T>C) seems to be pyridoxal responsive, while c.407 T>C mutation were pyridoxal non-responsive. On the other hand, timely and effective Hcy-lowering therapy for severe HHCY can significantly could reduce the vascular risk in patients with CBS deficiency in those of pyridoxal non-responsiveness, despite the fact that the post-treatment Hcy levels were still significantly higher than the normal range.[3]
In general, this study highlights that plasma Hcy should be screened for unexplained thromboembolic disease, especially in patients with mental retardation, scoliosis, lens dislocation, and skin pigmentation. For CBS deficiency, lifelong medication of B vitamins is needed, for pyridoxine non-responsiveness, betaine together with dietary restriction is recommended.

Abstract

Background: Despite an extensive evaluation program, patients may remain diagnostically

unresolved with regard to the etiology of their cognitive dysfunction. Cerebrospinal fluid neu-

roinflammation and Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers may act as indicators of neurodegen-

erative disorders in diagnostically unresolved patients. Methods: Data on 348 patients were

retrospectively evaluated. All participants had a standardized diagnostic workup and follow-

up in a memory clinic. Results: A42 levels and A42/p-tau ratios were reduced and levels of

t-tau and p-tau as well as the t-tau  p-tau/A42 ratio were elevated in diagnostically unre-

solved patients who clinically progressed, compared to a stable group. No differences in neu-

roinflammatory parameters were found. Conclusion: AD biomarkers - in particular the A42/

p-tau ratio, but not neuroinflammatory parameters - predicted clinical progression, regardless

of etiology.

Introduction

Dementia is a massive and growing global health-economic challenge with an estimated prevalence of 35.6 million people affected worldwide in 2010. A continuous increase in the prevalence of dementia is to be expected [1].
It is therefore of great importance to identify patients who suffer from cognitive impairment due to a neurodegenerative disease in order to implement proper treatment and care early in the course of the disease, as these patients will continue to deteriorate. It is equally important to identify in which cases Alzheimer disease (AD) is the cause of the cognitive impairment, as this patient group is by far the largest to whom symptomatic treatment can be offered. Likewise, an identification of patients with a high probability of progression early in the course of the disease is becoming increasingly important for clinical trials of disease-modifying agents. Treatment should preferably be initiated early in the course of the disease, when neuronal damage is still limited [2].
Frequently, patients referred for cognitive evaluation may still remain diagnostically unresolved with regard to the etiology of their cognitive dysfunction even after an extensive diagnostic workup including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analysis. These diagnostically unresolved patients may be diagnosed with either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or as demented with unknown etiology. The critical issue is to differentiate the underlying etiology in order to predict progression of the condition.
Not every case of MCI will progress to a dementia disorder; however, 10-15% of patients with MCI will develop AD within 1 year, and even 40-60% will develop AD within 5 years [3-5]. The concept of `dementia of unknown etiology' (DUE) has been used to describe demented patients who do not meet the criteria for any well-defined degenerative dementia such as AD, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, or other causes of secondary dementia (e.g. vitamin B12 deficiency or head trauma) [6].
The diagnosis of dementia is currently based on different sets of clinical diagnostic criteria, of which the NIA-AA criteria and ICD-10 criteria are generally accepted [7, 8]. Various biomarkers, in particular CSF biomarkers, have proven useful in increasing the diagnostic certainty in vivo, and findings from biomarker analyses have been incorporated into different research criteria for AD [9] but are also gaining increasing attention in clinical practice.
Potential biomarkers of cognitive decline and dementia need to exhibit a high diagnostic accuracy and should reflect the biochemical and pathological hallmarks of the disease. At present, known biomarkers still lack sufficient diagnostic accuracy [10].
CSF analysis may to a large extent support the diagnosis if AD is the underlying pathology, but AD biomarkers (i.e. A42, t-tau, and p-tau) cannot definitely confirm the diagnosis even in the presence of typical findings, since these alterations may also be present in cognitively healthy persons as well as in patients with other neurodegenerative disorders [10-15]. However, decreased levels of CSF A42 and increased levels of t-tau and p-tau confer a high likelihood of AD being the cause of the cognitive dysfunction in both dementia and MCI [16].
There is an increasing interest in the involvement of neuroinflammation in the development and progression of dementia. Evidence of this involvement derives from pathophysiologic studies, which have revealed a number of inflammatory mediators to be upregulated in the AD brain [10, 17, 18]. Other studies have suggested that the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles has the ability to initiate and sustain a chronic inflammatory response via the complement system during the disease [19, 20]. The CSF/serum albumin ratio, as an indicator of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, has a limited differential diagnostic power, as it may be affected in both neuroinflammatory diseases as well as in cerebrovascular lesions; however, it is generally found to be a reliable sign of an active process [21- 24]. Elevated CSF/serum albumin ratio, white cell count, and intrathecal IgG synthesis may

therefore be potential markers of neuroinflammatory processes, which implies that analysis of theses markers in CSF can help to improve diagnostic accuracy and predict prognosis in patients referred for dementia evaluation.
In our study, we aimed to investigate the role of CSF neuroinflammation and AD biomarkers in the diagnostic workup for a group of diagnostically unresolved patients in a typical memory clinical setting. In this group, despite an extensive evaluation program including CSF biomarker analysis, experienced clinicians were not able to establish whether a neurodegenerative disease was the cause of the cognitive impairment or not. Hence, we investigated the biomarkers' ability to predict clinical progression, and thereby their ability to potentially differentiate between neurodegenerative and nonneurodegenerative disorders as causes of cognitive impairment in diagnostically unresolved patients. Furthermore, we compared the diagnostically unresolved patients to a control group of AD patients as well as a group of healthy elders to elucidate similarities.

Subjects and Methods
Data were retrospectively collected from the Danish Dementia Biobank on patients consecutively referred for cognitive evaluation and diagnosed with either MCI, DUE, or AD at 2 multidisciplinary memory clinics (Regional Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurology, Zealand University Hospital, and Copenhagen Memory Clinic, Department of Neurology, University Hospital Copenhagen, Rigshospitalet) between June 2009 and June 2013. The study population also included a healthy control (HC) group recruited solely for research purposes.
As part of the diagnostic workup, at baseline all patients underwent a standardized diagnostic assessment including physical and neurological examinations, routine blood analysis, lumbar puncture with CSF analysis, brain CT or MRI, as well as cognitive screening [i.e. MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE)]. If it was thought diagnostically relevant, the patients also had a full neuropsychological evaluation undertaken by a neuropsychologist. Diagnoses were settled by consensus in an experienced multidisciplinary team based on all the available examination results, including the results from the CSF analysis. Patients with AD were diagnosed according to the NINCDSADRDA criteria (2009-2011), subsequently according to the NIA-AA criteria [7, 9]. Patients with MCI were diagnosed according to the Winblad consensus criteria [25]. Patients with DUE were those diagnosed as being demented according to the ICD-10 and NIA-AA criteria [7, 8] but who did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for any subtype of dementia or secondary dementia because the underlying etiology could not be identified.
All patients were clinically evaluated - including repeated MMSE testing and information from caregivers - on an ongoing basis with at least 1-year intervals as part of the normal clinical setting in the 2 multidisciplinary memory clinics. The diagnoses were continuously reevaluated at the follow-up visits. Based on clinical progression, to fulfill the criteria for AD or other well-defined dementia disease, the diagnoses were subsequently revised by an experienced physician or at a multidisciplinary conference.
The healthy subjects were all volunteers recruited for scientific research purposes. They were all without memory complaints or other cognitive symptoms as well as signs of major neurological, psychiatric, or physical diseases that could potentially elicit cognitive impairment. The healthy subjects all underwent the same standardized diagnostic assessment in one of the 2 memory clinics, including physical and neurologic examinations, routine blood analysis, brain CT or MRI, cognitive screening, as well as blood sample screening, ECG, and lumbar puncture at inclusion.

CSF was obtained by puncture in the L3-L4 or L4-L5 intervertebral space and collected in polypropylene tubes. The CSF analyses included white cell count, erythrocytes, total protein, glucose, and albumin as well as IgG index and oligoclonal bands and the core AD biomarkers (i.e. A42, t-tau, and p-tau). The CSF/serum albumin ratio was used as a marker of the integrity of the BBB, due to the fact that albumin is exclusively synthesized in the liver [21-24]. The CSF/serum albumin ratio is therefore a dimensionless CSF protein concentration, independent of blood variations [22]. The IgG index was used to determine IgG synthesis, and along with the CSF white cell count was used as an indicator of active neuroinflammation as well as a marker of BBB integrity.
For the purposes of this study, patients initially diagnosed with MCI or DUE were combined into a group of patients defined as diagnostically unresolved. Based on the ongoing clinical evaluation, the diagnostically unresolved patients were subsequently divided into a group of patients who progressed during follow-up to eventually fulfill the criteria for a welldefined dementia disease and a group of stable patients who did not progress or who were diagnosed with a nonneurodegenerative disorder.
The study was reported and approved by the Data Protection Agency authorities. As the study is a retrospective study exclusively analyzing data from the Danish Dementia Biobank, no specific ethics committee approval was needed according to local legislation.
Comparisons between groups were performed using the nonparametric KruskalWallis test followed by the Mann-Whitney U test for pairwise comparisons. To correct for multiple comparisons, results were considered statistically significant if p values were <0.01. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of each CSF parameter and biomarker individually as well as in combination were drawn as a plot of the true-positive value (sensitivity) against the false-positive value (1 - specificity) for different possible cutoff values of the respective markers. The ROC curves illustrate the ability of each biomarker or combination of biomarkers to correctly classify progressive and stable patients. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated as a measure of a biomarker's overall accuracy. Optimized cutoff levels for AD biomarkers individually and in combination were derived from the ROC curves by the cutoff that maximized the sum of sensitivity and specificity. Previous studies have found a clear correlation between age and t-tau level, which makes it necessary to determine separate cutoff values for different age categories [26]. In our study, only 4 patients were under the age of 45 years at baseline; hence, age stratification was not performed. We also used previously reported reference values for CSF A42, t-tau, and p-tau to evaluate how they performed in predicting clinical progression in a population of diagnostically unresolved patients (table 3) [27, 28]. The statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 22 and the R environment for statistical computing version 3.1.2.

Results
A total of 348 patients were included. They were either diagnosed with MCI (n = 60), DUE (n = 83), or AD (n = 172) or as HC (n = 33). The group of diagnostically unresolved patients (the MCI and DUE groups) included 143 patients.
Seventy-two of the 143 diagnostically unresolved patients remained clinically stable during the follow-up period (mean follow-up time 21.4 months, range 1-59), and 71 patients progressed to fulfill the criteria for a well-defined dementia disease. Seven patients in the stable group had a follow-up period of less than 1 year due to the identification of nonneurodegenerative conditions during clinical follow-up (e.g. depression, cerebral infarction) or full recovery.

No significant differences in MMSE score were observed between the progressive and the stable group.
Table 2 illustrates the baseline CSF inflammation and AD biomarker levels and ratios among the diagnostic groups. The concentration of CSF A42 was significantly lower in patients who clinically progressed during the follow-up period than in the clinically stable patients and the HC, but it was not significantly different from that of the AD group. The clinically stable group had a significantly lower baseline CSF A42 level than the HC, but a higher level than the AD group. As expected, the HC group had a significantly higher baseline CSF A42 level than all the other groups. With regard to tau protein, the clinically progressive group had significantly higher levels of both CSF t-tau and p-tau protein than the stable group, but it did not significantly differ in either t-tau or p-tau levels from the AD or the HC group. The stable group had significantly lower levels of CSF t-tau and p-tau protein than the AD

group, but no significant differences in either level were found compared to the HC group. The HC group had only a significantly lower CSF p-tau level, but not CSF t-tau level, than the AD group. The CSF inflammation biomarkers (i.e. white cell count, IgG index, and CSF/serum albumin ratio) did not show any significant differences when comparing the clinically progressive, the clinically stable, and the HC group. Only a significantly higher CSF white cell count was found in the AD group when compared to the clinically progressive group. This can be attributed to a few outlier patients with highly elevated CSF white cell counts only in the AD group. Our data showed great variability in the few patients with an elevated white cell count and may therefore not be representative of the different patient groups.
The CSF A42/p-tau ratio differed significantly between all groups when comparing the groups pairwise. The ratio was significantly lower in both patients who progressed clinically

Similarly, a higher CSF A42/p-tau ratio was seen in the HC than in the clinically stable patients, as illustrated in figure 1 and table 2.
We calculated the CSF t-tau  p-tau/A42 ratio for each diagnostic group. The ratio was significantly higher in the clinically progressive group than in both the clinically stable group and the HC. No significant difference was found between the clinically progressive and the AD group. Similarly, a higher ratio was found in the AD group than in the clinically stable patients and HC. No significant difference was observed between the clinically stable group and the HC, as illustrated in figure 2 and table 2.
ROC curves are shown in figure 3. Individual AUCs for the different CSF AD biomarkers as predictors of future progression ranged from 0.69 for t-tau and p-tau to 0.77 for A42, indicating that CSF A42 had the highest predictive value of the 3 AD biomarkers. A better performance in predicting future progression in our group of diagnostically unresolved patients was found for CSF AD biomarkers in combination: A42/p-tau ratio (AUC = 0.82) and t-tau  p-tau/A42 ratio (AUC = 0.80). The ROC analysis revealed a low prognostic accuracy for CSF inflammation biomarkers (i.e. CSF white cell count: AUC = 0.56; CSF/serum albumin ratio: AUC = 0.56; CSF IgG index: AUC = 0.51).

Discussion
The main objective of our study was to investigate the role of CSF inflammation and AD biomarkers in the diagnostic workup in a group of diagnostically unresolved patients in a routine clinical setting. This is highly relevant to clinicians in a normal clinical setting, as they frequently meet these unresolved patients.
In particular, we aimed to investigate how CSF inflammation and AD biomarkers performed as well as to study their ability to predict clinical progression - and thereby their ability to identify neurodegenerative versus nonneurodegenerative disorders as causes of cognitive impairment in diagnostically unresolved patients.

In our study, we found that those diagnostically unresolved patients who clinically progressed to fulfill the criteria for a well-defined dementia due to a neurodegenerative disease had a biomarker profile characteristic of AD at baseline which reflected the neuropathological hallmarks of AD with progressive accumulation of A plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal degeneration [13, 29-31]. In contrast, a similar biomarker profile was not seen in the stable diagnostically unresolved patients.
Therefore, it is very possible that the majority of the progressive diagnostically unresolved patients in our group in fact represent patients with underlying AD, but with initially atypical or subtle signs and symptoms. Some may, however, also suffer from another neurodegenerative dementia, since the CSF biomarkers' performance in distinguishing between different forms of dementia is less solid [31-34].
Previous studies have demonstrated that AD biomarkers have the ability to differentiate between AD patients and healthy elders with high sensitivity and specificity (80-90%); also, an abnormal biomarker pattern in MCI may predict progression to AD in 90% of MCI cases within 9.2 years [32, 33, 35]. The AD biomarkers assessed in our group of diagnostically unresolved patients exhibited a slightly lower ability to accurately predict future progression, with diagnostic accuracies ranging from 0.69 to 0.7 (fig. 3). This may partly be explained by the fact that we exclusively analyzed whether cognitively impaired patients progressed to neurodegenerative dementia or not, which included all degenerative disorders and not only AD.
The CSF A42 level had the highest predictive ability of the 3 well-established AD biomarkers, which supports the theory of amyloid positivity being a risk factor for developing AD as well as the notion that AD biomarkers become abnormal in a temporally ordered manner in which t-tau and p-tau protein are usually not abnormal until later in the course of AD [12, 32, 36-38].
The notion of combining 2 aspects of AD pathology - i.e. plaques (A42) and neurodegeneration (p-tau) - as a biomarker of continuous cognitive decline and clinical progression to AD in MCI patients has shown promising results [32, 35, 39]. In particular, the CSF A42/p-tau ratio exhibited a great capacity to predict progression in MCI patients younger than 70 years, probably due to the lower importance of comorbidities when compared to older groups [35]. However, to our knowledge, similar findings have not previously been described for a mixed group of diagnostically unresolved patients.
Our findings with regard to the CSF A42/p-tau ratio suggest that it may also be a useful predictor of future clinical progression in a heterogeneous group of diagnostically unresolved patients in a normal clinical setting. ROC analysis did indeed reveal that the ratio outperformed the prevalent biomarkers individually (fig. 3). It is noteworthy though that the mean age in all groups of our study was in fact below 70 years, which could partly explain the considerable potential of the A42/p-tau ratio as a prognostic indicator [32, 34, 35, 39-41].
Furthermore, of all the biomarkers, only the A42/p-tau ratio had a significant discriminative power to separate all the groups individually. However, supposing the A42/p-tau ratio were to be incorporated as a useful diagnostic tool into a normal clinical setting with a heterogeneous group of cognitively impaired patients, generally accepted cutoff values for demented populations would need to be established [33].
The optimized cutoff values derived from the ROC curves for the individual AD biomarkers were similar to well-established reference values (table 3) [27, 28, 42]. Our optimized cutoff value for the A42/p-tau ratio may therefore potentially be representative of a heterogeneous group of diagnostically unresolved patients, even though cutoff levels established within a population sample tend to overestimate their true diagnostic accuracy [29].
However, Buchhave et al. [32] reported a somewhat lower optimized cutoff value with regard to the CSF A42/p-tau ratio of <6.16 (with a sensitivity of 0.88 and a specificity of 0.90) for predicting development of AD within 9.2 years in MCI patients. The observed difference

may partly be due to the shorter follow-up period in our study, since some of the clinically stable patients might still progress during a longer follow-up period. Nevertheless, cutoff levels also tend to differ between studies [33]. This discrepancy is probably partly due to methodological variability and the absence of validated technical standard processes for CSF analysis [43].
Adding the t-tau protein as a biomarker of nonspecific neural damage did not add any discriminatory power over the A42/p-tau ratio for separating clinically progressive from clinically stable patients (fig. 3).
CSF neuroinflammation biomarkers are traditionally used in diagnostic workup primarily to exclude nonneurodegenerative disorders as causes of dementia, especially inflammatory diseases. In our population, only 1 patient was subsequently diagnosed with primary progressive multiple sclerosis.
Growing evidence indicates that unspecific neuroinflammation contributes to the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative diseases including AD and related dementias [17, 20, 44]. Neuropathological findings suggest that cerebral inflammation plays a key role in the toxicity of amyloid and thus is part of an essential mechanism that determines which patients with intracerebral tau and amyloid pathology will become demented or stay nondemented. Other studies suggested that amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles have the ability to initiate and sustain a chronic intracerebral inflammatory response [19, 20].
In our study, we did not find any indications for neuroinflammation in any of the groups. The fact that no increased signs of neuroinflammation or BBB dysfunction were found in clinically progressive diagnostically unresolved patients - and even in AD patients - compared to clinically stable patients was unexpected in light of the mounting evidence of the role of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative dementias. This is quite in contrast to a recent study by Ngga et al. [20], which reported neuroinflammation to be independently linked to both rapidly progressive disease and early death in patients with AD. However, it is important to note that these authors found neuroinflammation to be independently linked to rapidly progressive disease and early death in patients with AD, whereas the less aggressive courses of the disease may not exhibit same level of neuroinflammation.
Furthermore, Ngga et al. [20] found an elevated CSF/serum albumin ratio to be a predictor of death in AD patients. The CSF/serum albumin ratio is an indicator of BBB integrity. It has limited differential diagnostic power; nevertheless, it is a reliable sign of an active process [21-24, 45, 46]. Previous studies have reported conflicting evidence regarding findings of BBB dysfunction in neurodegenerative dementias, often attributing the presence of altered BBB integrity to concurrent neurovascular diseases [21, 23, 24]. However, evidence of altered BBB integrity in both neurodegenerative and vascular dementias has been established - even if BBB dysfunction was still found to be more pronounced in vascular dementia than in AD [45, 46].

There were no compelling signs of BBB dysfunction (i.e. abnormal CSF/serum albumin ratio or IgG index) in any of the groups of our study. Likewise, the ROC curves revealed a poor performance of all CSF neuroinflammation parameters when used to predict future cognitive decline and clinical progression in our population of diagnostically unresolved patients.
Strengths and Limitations The strengths of our study are, first of all, its clinical setting, since we used a consecutively recruited, heterogeneous memory clinic population. Second, all diagnoses were established by consensus among an experienced multidisciplinary team based upon all the available examination results, and the diagnoses were reevaluated on an ongoing basis. Third, all lumbar punctures were performed by experienced physicians at 2 memory clinics, with established standard procedures for the lumbar puncture and subsequent sample handling. Finally, the CSF AD biomarker analyses were all carried out at one central laboratory. A potential limitation of our study is the risk of circularity. The lumbar punctures and CSF analyses were performed in a clinical setting during the diagnostic workup, and the results were used in the diagnostic consensus-building process. This may have influenced diagnoses both at baseline and during the ongoing clinical evaluation, but not with regard to whether patients clinically progressed during follow-up. The variability in follow-up periods in our study was high. This may particularly be an issue with regard to the clinically stable group, as it is well established that time to conversion varies within a wide range, and it is likely that some of the patients labelled clinically stable in our study will eventually convert to having a neurodegenerative disease [29, 33]. The variability in follow-up periods is partly due to the fact that shortly after their initial diagnosis, a few patients were reevaluated and found without cognitive complaints or to suffer from nondegenerative diseases, and thus were lost to follow-up. Our study may consequently underestimate the predictive value of the biomarkers assessed.

Conclusion
We investigated a group of patients with cognitive impairment who, even after an extensive diagnostic assessment involving CSF biomarkers, remained diagnostically unresolved as to the underlying cause of their impairment. We found that baseline CSF AD biomarkers - but not CSF neuroinflammation parameters - had the potential to predict clinical progression, regardless of the underlying condition.
Furthermore, the CSF A42/p-tau ratio showed both high discriminative power in separating progressive from stable diagnostically unresolved patients and a great ability to predict AD as the underlying neurodegenerative disease. This implies that the CSF A42/p-tau ratio might potentially be superior to the CSF AD biomarkers individually in predicting continuous cognitive decline and clinical progression in a group of initially diagnostically unresolved patients.
Our findings also suggest that a large proportion of initially diagnostically unresolved patients might in fact present with early AD with atypical or subtle symptoms and signs. Our findings may be clinically relevant in improving prognostic measures for initially diagnostically unresolved patients, but they are also relevant in identifying suitable patients for clinical trials of disease-modifying agents, which should be administered very early in the clinical course. More longitudinal studies of the diagnostic and predictive performance of CSF biomarkers in diagnostically unresolved patients with longer follow-up periods are needed to support our findings.

INTRODUCTION
Sleep disturbance in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) are frequent and disabling features, affecting approximately 25-60% of all patients. The most common sleep related complaints are insomnia, sleep fragmentation and excessive daytime sleepiness, frequently accompanied by sleep apnea in patients with probable AD.1 Change in sleep precedes the onset of cognitive symptoms in patients with AD, and a strong association exists between disrupted sleep and the development of AD.2 Cholinergic neuronal loss of Meynert nucleus in the basal forebrain is a pathophysiological hallmark

of AD, and cholinergic activity in the central nervous system influences upper airway opening via the central and peripheral mechanism. Decreased thalamic pontine cholinergic projections may affect the respiratory drive, leading to both central and obstructive apnea in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD.3,4 The primary pharmacological treatments approved for AD are central acting cholinesterase inhibitors, and rivastigmine transdermal patches are frequently used in mild to moderate AD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of rivastigmine transdermal patches on sleep architectures and sleep apnea in patients with probable AD.

nitive and dementia center at Myongji hospital. Patients who met the criteria for probable AD, established by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association,5 were included in the present study. They ranged from 50 to 90 years of age, and had a Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE)6 score of 10 to 20. The brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging showed no clinical evidence of other diseases (i.e., normal pressure hydrocephalus, brain tumor, cerebrovascular disease) capable of producing a dementia syndrome. They had reliable caregivers who met the patient at least twice a week, and was sufficiently familiar with the patient to provide the investigator accurate information. We enrolled those patients with dementia, where the reliable caregivers observed and reported snoring and stopping of breathing during the night. The exclusion criteria included any primary neurodegenerative or psychiatric disorders other than AD (i.e., Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, or major depressive disorder); clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (such as an abnormal thyroid function test, abnormally low levels of vitamin B12 or folate, or positive Venereal Disease Research laboratory test); any history of drug or alcohol addiction; any severe or unstable medical disease; any hearing or visual impairment that could disturb the efficient evaluation of the patient; any active skin lesion; a history of allergy to topical products containing any of the constituents of the patches; and an involvement in other clinical trials or treated by any an experimental drug within the past three months. Participants should not be taking any acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) or other anti-dementia drugs for at least four weeks prior to the baseline visit. Subjects were able to visit an outpatient clinic and to perform sleep study and cognitive function tests with walkers, canes or wheelchairs accompanied by their caregivers. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical reporting practices. The study protocol and informed consent form were reviewed and approved by the institutional review board before commencement of the study. Prior to participation in the study, both the patients and their legal guardians or representatives gave their written informed consent to participate.
Sleep study and parameters Enrolled patients took part in a sleep questionnaire to eval-
uate their sleep problems and sleep environments. They were also rated on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)7 and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS)8 to measure daytime sleepiness, as well as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)9 to evaluate depressive moods. After completing the questionnaire, the sub-

jects underwent two overnight polysomnographies (PSG), before and after rivastigmine transdermal patch application. PSG recorded the electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), chin electromyography (EMG), leg EMG, electrocardiography, and microphone for recording the sounds of snoring, plethysmography for evaluating respiratory airflow and effort, and oximetry for checking arterial oxygen saturation. PSG was performed overnight in a sleep laboratory with a sleep technologist in attendance. The scoring and staging followed the American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical guidelines.10 Hypopnea was defined 50% airflow reduction and 3% desaturation or arousal. Sleep stages were based on 3 sources of data coming from 7 channels: EEG, EOG, and chin EMG. Sleep architecture considered the following variables: proportion of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep period; N1, N2, N3, and REM sleep periods from PSG data. Breathing event during sleep was evaluated as the Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) and Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI), which included AHI and respiratory event related arousal. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) was defined by AHI or RDI of 5 or higher, in association with excessive daytime somnolence. Other variables, including periodic limb movement during sleep (PLMS), total sleep time (TST), total wake time (TWT), wake time after sleep onset (WASO) and sleep onset latency (SL), and sleep efficiency (SE), were calculated from data of overnight PSG.
Neuropsychological tests The K-MMSE was administrated at the screening, baseline
and at the end of the study. The clinical dementia rating (CDR)11 and Korean version of AD assessment scale-cognitive (ADAScog) subscale12 were collected at the baseline and at end of the study. All of the above neuropsychological tests were performed with the same clinical psychologist for the entire period of the clinical trial.
Statistical analysis Sleep variables, such as the proportion of N1, N2, N3, and
REM, TST, TWT, WASO, SL, SE, RDI, AHI, PLMS index from overnight PSG and ESS, SSS, BDI from the sleep questionnaire and K-MMSE, CDR ADAS-cog score were compared with baseline and at 12 weeks after rivastigmine patches were applied. Comparative analysis between the data from the baseline study and the data from follow up studies for all enrolled patients with AD were analyzed by the chi-square test to compare categorical variables, and the paired t-test to compare continuous variables, using SPSS v 17.0 software (SPSS for Windows, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

trated 5 cm2 rivastigmine patch per day for 4 weeks. In the absence of any adverse events related with the patch, patients were treated to 10 cm2 rivastigmine patch for three months. However, five patients reported skin eruptions or erythema and itching at the site of application during the run-in period of four weeks. They were excluded from this study because of skin problems attributed to rivastigmine transdermal patch. Finally, fourteen patients achieved a target patch size of 10 cm2 rivastigmine patch from the initial patch application (Fig. 1). After 12 weeks from baseline sleep and neurocognitive studies, a follow up sleep and neurocognitive study was performed in these fourteen patients. They were 68.44.3 [mean켽tandard deviation(SD)] years old, and included five males and nine females. Their body mass index was 23.82.9 (mean켚D) kg/m2. Education status of enrolled patients was 4.023.04 (mean SD) years, and K-MMSE was 193.0 (mean켚D) at the baseline level. ADAS-cog was 3110.1 (mean켚D) at baseline level. All these patients did not consume coffee or caffeine containing tea. Three patients (two males, one female) reported initiation insomnia as well as SDB. One of these patients was on antihypertensive drug for 10 years. The other patients had no vascular risk factors such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension, stroke or cardiac problems.

the baseline levels after treatment. However, RDI and AHI (28.414.4 and 24.7628.2, respectively) markedly decreased after the rivastigmine patch treatment (p<0.05) compared to RDI and AHI at baseline level (45.318.4 and 41 12.4, respectively). ESS and SSS from the sleep questionnaire showed no differences between baseline and after treatment. The sleep study findings are summarized in Table 1. The K-MMSE and CDR were 193.0 and 1.20.4 (mean켚D) at the baseline level, and 183.0 and 1.30.66 (mean켚D) after rivastigmine patch application, respectively. ADAS-cog scores were 3110.1 (mean켚D) at baseline and 22.55.9 (mean SD) after treatment. However, there was no statistical significance of cognition and in the functional state before and after rivastigmine transdermal patch treatment. These results are outlined in Table 1.
DISCUSSION
Several studies support the association between sleep apnea and AD.2,3 SDB reported a high prevalence (33% to 60%) of patients with AD, and is considered as an important non-cognitive symptom contributing to three clinical courses of AD.2 SDB is often reported to have an association with agitation or day time somnolence, other than cardiovascular risk, in patients with AD.13,14 Therefore, treatment of SDB is considered to be a significant issue in the management of patients with AD. Ancoli-Israel et al.15 reported that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reduced daytime somnolence in patients with mild to moderate AD with SDB. Cooke et al.16 reported that the long-term CPAP treatment for patients with AD and SDB may result in improvements of sleep and mood, as well as a slowing cognitive deterioration. Especially for patients with dementia, it is difficult to maintain CPAP therapy because most of the cognitive behavioral problems are aggravated during night time sleep. In contrast to previous studies on physical and surgical treatment for SDB, there is a dearth of effective pharmacological approaches.17 Very few studies have examined the effects of cholinergic treatment on sleep in patients with AD. A study on the effects of tacrine on REM sleep was not conclusive, probably since doses higher than 100 mg per day could not be administered due to hepatotoxicity.18 PSG data by Moraes et al.19 reported that donepezil inhibits acetylcholinesterase improved obstructive sleep apnea and increased REM sleep density and periods in patients with AD. No evidence of worsening sleep or nightmares were found in the above study. Suckys-Claudino et al.20 showed that donepezil treatment improved RDI, oxygen desaturation, and sleepiness. These studies with donepezil support the conceptual opinion that cholinergic transmission
156 Dement Neurocogn Disord 2016;15(4):153-158

might influence breathing regulation in patients with AD/ SDB. Meanwhile, rivastigmine transdermal patches are another form of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors, which are currently approved for the treatment of patients with probable AD.21 A transdermal form of rivastigmine has several advantages, including continuous delivery with reduced fluctuation of plasma drug levels, improved tolerability, easy administration of optimal doses, and preference for caregivers.22-24 We expect and focus the stable cholinergic properties of rivastigmine patches be tolerated by our enrolled subjects; however, adverse events, such as skin rash or itching sensation, developed in a few patients after rivastigmine patch application. The present study demonstrated that rivastigmine patch treatment has the potential to reduce RDI and improve sleep apnea or hypopnea, but did not changed other sleep parameters, namely sleep latency, SE, WASO or REM sleep density and periods. Another finding is that improved RDI of patients with AD on rivastigmine patch treatment was not statistically significant when correlated to cognitive function measured by ADAS-cog. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first PSG study on the effect of rivastigmine transdermal patches in patients with probable AD. Until now, most cholinergic drugs mainly increase the REM density and decrease the latency of REM onset. However, several studies have shown contradictory results, depending on the subjects or drugs enrolled in each study.25,26 In particular, a recent study of rivastigmine in elderly persons significantly reduced the REM latency, while there was no effect on REM sleep proportion.27 In our study, the rivastigmine patch treatment did not affect the proportion of REM sleep or latency to REM onset, and REM density. We suggest that a large sample longitudinal study would be appropriate to estimate the effect of rivastigmine during REM sleep. In degenerative conditions such as dementia, the decreased thalamo-pontine cholinergic projections may affect the respiratory drive, leading to both central and obstructive sleep apnea.3,28 Based on this mechanism, increasing the cholinergic tone by ChEIs in thalamopontine cholinergic projections could improve SDB. We consider that the cholinergic action of rivastigmine transdermal patch is the main mechanism for improving SDB. In contrast, enhancing REM sleep of ChEIs might affect sleep apnea in a negative way, in spite of its positive effect to impaired cognitive functions. Such conflicting effects make it difficult to understand the actual mechanisms. A possible explanation is that rivastigmine increases the central cholinergic transmission in areas related to different tasks, including cognitive function, REM sleep generation and regulation. We suggest that further studies for the cholinergic effects of ChEIs on REM sleep and SDB should be conducted to confirm our conclusion. In our

study, follow up scores of ADAS-cog improved, compared to the baseline study. However, a small size of subjects could not generate a statistical significance. In another randomized double blind study, rivastigmine showed increasing ADAS-cog score with improved cognitive function, and participation in activities of daily living in patients with mild to moderately severe AD.22,23,27 Anatomic structures affected by AD, to some degree, overlap with those related to the genesis and control of REM sleep. This made some researchers to speculate that there might be a functional relationship between REM sleep and the pathogenesis of AD.28 The relationship between REM sleep and cognition still requires complex interpretation. The role played by REM sleep disturbances in the cognitive impairment of patients with AD continues to be a promising research field. For clinicians who prescribe drugs to patients with dementia, including probable AD patients, many have considerable comorbidity, including psychiatric or behavioral symptoms, other than sleep disturbance. Among the comorbidity findings, SDB is an important factor that could contribute to cognitive decline in patients with dementia. Clinicians sometimes have enemies on all sides to manage patients with AD and SDB. Fortunately, ChEIs are expected to aid in this issue based on studies that support the positive effects of ChEIs on patients with SDB, including our current study. There are some limitations of small size, short duration of study, and no control group to make a confirmative result from this data. Therefore, further large randomized double-blinded controlled studies are needed to conclude the effect and action of ChEIs on SBD in patients with probable AD.

Abstract

Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by recalcitrant hypophosphatemia. Reports from the Indian subcontinent are scarce, with most being single center experiences involving few patients. Herein, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 30 patients of TIO diagnosed at three tertiary care hospitals in India. Patients with persistent hypophosphatemia (despite correction of hypovitaminosis D), normocalcemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, low TmP/GFR and elevated or `inappropriately normal' FGF23 levels were labeled as having TIO. They were sequentially subjected to functional followed by anatomical imaging. Patients with a well-localized tumor underwent excision; others were put on phosphorous and calcitriol supplementation. The mean age at presentation was 39.6 years with female:male ratio of 3:2. Bone pain (83.3%) and proximal myopathy (70%) were the chief complaints; 40% of cases had fractures. The mean delay in diagnosis was 3.8 years. Tumors were clinically detectable in four patients (13.3%). The mean serum phosphate was 0.50mmol/L with a median serum FGF23 level of 518RU/mL. Somatostatin receptor-based scintigraphy was found to be superior to FDG-PET in tumor localization. Lower extremities were the most common site of the tumor (72%). Tumor size was positively correlated with serum FGF23 levels. Twenty-two patients underwent tumor resection and 16 of them had phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors. Surgical excision led to cure in 72.7% of patients whereas disease persistence and disease recurrence were seen in 18.2% and 9.1% of cases, respectively. At the last follow-up, serum phosphate in the surgically treated group was significantly higher than in the medically managed group.

Introduction
Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), also known as oncogenic osteomalacia, is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by persistent hypophosphatemia. The basic pathophysiology of underlying hypophosphatemia is increased renal phosphate wasting consequent to raised

levels of circulating phosphatonins. The best-characterized phosphatonin is fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a 32kDa polypeptide consisting of 251 amino acids (1). In addition, other phosphatonins like secreted frizzled protein-4, matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein

(MEPE), FGF 7 and certain non-collagenous matrix proteins called SIBLING have also been implicated (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). In most cases, small, benign, mesenchymal soft tissue tumors are responsible for the increased FGF23 production (8, 9). Besides causing phosphaturia, FGF23 inhibits renal 1-hydroxylase, the enzyme that converts 25-hydroxy vitamin D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (10). Low levels of active vitamin D further impairs intestinal absorption of phosphate and deters mineralization of the osteoid matrix. Chronic hypophosphatemia leads to skeletal manifestations of osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children (11). Adults complain of bone pains, fatigue, proximal myopathy and fragility fractures (12). Untreated TIO leads to significant morbidity and can be debilitating (13). Fortunately, complete tumoral excision leads to rapid normalization of biochemical parameters and resolution of symptoms (14). Around 300 cases of TIO have been reported worldwide, however reports from the Indian subcontinent are limited (2, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21). Herein, we describe the clinical features, biochemical parameters, imaging modalities and the treatment outcome in 30 patients of TIO diagnosed at three tertiary care hospitals in India.
Materials and methods
A retrospective analysis of the medical records of TIO cases diagnosed at three tertiary care hospitals from January 2011 to December 2017 was conducted.
All patients (more than 18 years of age) who presented to us with symptoms suggestive of osteomalacia (namely bone pain, proximal muscle weakness and/or fragility fractures) underwent a detailed historical evaluation with special emphasis on duration of symptoms and similar family history. All patients who had a similar family history were excluded as they were more likely to be hereditary causes of hypophosphatemic osteomalacia rather than TIO. A thorough physical examination, concentrating on any `lumps or bumps' present on the body, was performed in all patients.
Blood samples for biochemical investigations were collected after 8h of overnight fasting. Serum calcium (reference range (RR) 2.15-2.55 mmol/L), inorganic phosphate (RR 0.87-1.45mmol/L), albumin (RR 4.93-6.96 mol/L), alkaline phosphatase (RR 40-129IU/L) and creatinine (RR 35.36-106.06mol/L) were measured by autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Modular P 800). Calcium values were corrected for respective serum albumin levels. Serum iPTH (RR 1.6-6.9pmol/L)

and 25(OH)D (RR 27.1-107nmol/L) were measured by electrochemiluminescence assay using commercially available kits (Elecsys 2010 system, Roche Diagnostic). Those having hypovitaminosis D at the time of presentation were parenterally supplemented with 6 lakhs IU of cholecalciferol and a biochemical panel was repeated after 4 weeks. Patients who remained symptomatic and continued to have hypophosphatemia even after correction of serum vitamin D levels were suspected of having hypophosphatemic osteomalacia. In them, subsequently, TmP/GFR was calculated with the help of the standard nomogram (22). Finally, those patients having refractory hypophosphatemia, normocalcemia, elevated ALP and low TmP/GFR underwent estimation of serum FGF23 levels, using a two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Human FGF23 (C-Term) ELISA, Quidel Immutopics, RR 0-150RU/mL, the coefficient of variation <10%). Patients with the above biochemical profile and elevated or `inappropriately normal' FGF23 levels were labeled as having TIO. Written informed consent for publication of their clinical details and/or clinical images was obtained from all the patients. Ethical clearance for the study was obtained from the Institutional Ethical Committee, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.
Biochemical confirmation was followed by imaging studies in an attempt to localize a culprit tumor. Functional imaging was carried out in most cases using somatostatin receptor-based scintigraphy (68Ga-DOTATATE/DOTANOC, 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy), although 18F-FDGPET/CT scan was used in some of the patients. Anatomical tumor localization was done using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) depending upon the nature of the suspected lesion with CT being preferred for bony lesions and MRI being preferred for soft tissue lesions. A thorough skeletal survey was performed in all patients including radiographs of the skull, cervical, thoracic, lumbosacral spine (antero-posterior/lateral), bilateral shoulders with proximal humeri, both bones of forearm, hands, rib cage, pelvis, proximal femur and both bones of the leg.
Patients with a well-localized tumor underwent excision, and post-surgery serum phosphate level was monitored daily till it got normalized. Serum FGF23 level was repeated 2 months after tumor resection. Patients with no tumor localization or surgically inaccessible tumors were medically managed with oral phosphate and calcitriol supplementation. Phosphate was supplemented in the form of sodium phosphate granules at a starting dose of 20mg/kg/day in four to five divided doses which

was gradually hiked up to a dose of 50mg/kg/day in an attempt to achieve serum phosphate in the low normal range. Calcitriol was supplemented at a starting dose of 20ng/kg/day in three divided doses and was titrated based on serum iPTH and urinary calcium levels. A baseline ultrasonography of the kidneys was done in all medically treated patients to rule out nephrolithiasis /nephrocalcinosis and was repeated half yearly. Surgically treated patients presenting with recurrence or persistence of symptoms underwent repeat imaging in an attempt to localize any residual or recurrent lesion. Subsequently, they either were reoperated or put on medical management. Serum phosphate levels at the last follow-up were compared between the surgically treated and the medically managed groups.
Statistical analysis was carried out using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 23.0 software program (SPSS Inc.). Shapiro-Wilk test was used to check normality of data. Normally distributed variables were expressed as mean켽.d. Correlations between serum phosphorous, FGF23, tumor size and SUVmax were calculated using Spearman correlation. Student's t-test (independent samples) was used to compare serum phosphate levels at initial presentation and the last follow-up as well as preand postoperative serum FGF23 levels.
Results
Over a period of 7 years from 2011 to 2017, a total of 30 cases of TIO were diagnosed at the three tertiary care hospitals of India. The demographic data and the biochemical investigations of all the 30 TIO patients have been summarized in Table 1. The chief presenting complaints were bone pain (83.3%), followed by proximal muscle weakness (70%). Pathological fractures were seen in 12 patients (40%); the most common site being the neck of femur, however none had vertebral fractures. The mean age of patients with and without fractures was comparable (40.0 vs 40.4 years). Physical examination could locate the culprit tumors in four (13.3%) patients (Table 2). Three of them were visible to the naked eye (patient 8 (over the right leg just below the knee), patient 11 (over the back) and patient 17 (over the lateral aspect of the left leg)) (Fig. 1). Patient 9, a 40-year-old female, had a palpable firm, globular mass in the right gluteal region that was picked up on dedicated physical examination.
Functional localization of the lesion was undertaken in all but one patient (patient 17, who had a visible lump over the lateral aspect of the left leg, in whom

only a contrast-enhanced computerized tomography was performed) (Table 3). Whole-body somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-based scintigraphy was performed in most patients, namely, 68Ga-DOTATATE/DOTANOC scintigraphy in 20 patients and 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC scan in two patients (Fig. 2). 18F-FDG-PET was performed in six patients while both SSTR-based scintigraphy and FDG-PET was done in one patient (and both had failed to localize any tracer-avid lesion). Subsequently, a definite anatomical lesion could be localized in 25 patients (83.3%). The most common site of tumor localization was the lower extremity (72%) followed by the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses (16%). One patient had a subcutaneous lesion over the back, while in two patients the lesion was localized in the mandible (patients 2 and 28). Most of the lesions were soft tissue tumors (60%), while the rest (40%) were seen to arise from bones. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between tumor size and FGF23 levels, while there was no significant correlation between SUVmax (maximum standardized uptake volume obtained from SSTR-based scintigraphy) and serum FGF23 levels.
Out of the 25 patients in whom a definite tumor could be localized, 22 of them subsequently underwent surgery (patients 1 to 22). The most common histopathology was that of a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor (16 patients, 72.7%) (Fig. 3) followed by hemangiopericytoma (3 patients, 13.6%). Two patients had giant cell tumors (patients 3 and 14), while one had an arteriovenous hemangioma of the left nasal cavity (patient 4). Postoperatively, serum phosphorous normalized in 18 patients, two of them (9.1%) had a local recurrence and required reoperation (patients 12 and 16). Serum phosphorous did not normalize in four patients (18.2%)

with persistent disease (patients 2, 3, 14 and 19). They were subsequently put on oral phosphorous and calcitriol supplementation. Postoperative serum FGF23 levels were available in 17 patients and there was a statistically significant decline in FGF23 levels compared to baseline (P=0.002). Patient 2 had persistent disease and postoperative FGF23 levels showed a rise (307 vs 201RU/mL at baseline). In another patient with persistent disease (patient 14), FGF23 remained high (1216 vs 3990RU/mL at baseline).
Surgery could not be done in eight patients; five of them did not have tumor localization (patients 23, 25, 26, 28, 29), one had a surgically inaccessible tumor (patient 27) and two patients were not willing for surgery (patients 24, 30). They were put on medical management. Baseline mean serum phosphate in the medically and surgically managed groups was almost similar (0.45 vs 0.55mmol/L,

Discussion
We have herein presented a retrospective series of 30 cases of TIO diagnosed at three tertiary care institute of the country over a period of 7 years. Our patients had a relatively younger age at presentation. Bone pain and proximal myopathy were the principal presenting complaints; fractures were seen in only 40% of the patients. The detailed physical examination was rewarding in four patients for detecting the primary lesion. SSTRbased scintigraphy proved superior to conventional

FDG-PET in localizing the culprit tumors. Soft tissue tumors were more commonly encountered than bony tumors with thighs being the predominant site. The most common histological tumor subtype was phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor-mixed connective tissue type. Surgical excision led to cure in 72.7% of patients; disease persistence and disease recurrence were seen in 18.2% and 9.1% of cases, respectively.
The mean age of our patients at the time of initial presentation was 39.6 years which is about half a decade earlier than what has been reported in world literature (23, 24, 25). It is however in congruence with an earlier report from India (15), possibly implying that TIO tends to present somewhat earlier in our population. There was a female:male ratio of 3:2. Usually, TIO shows no gender predilection and tends to affect males and females equally (24, 26, 27), hence, the female dominance of our series could merely reflect referral bias. However, occasional case series depicting a female preponderance has been reported in the past (28, 29). Most of our patients complained of bone pain

and proximal muscle weakness. However, only 40% of our patients had radiologically proven pathological fractures. This appears fairly low when compared to world literature that has reported fracture rates as high as 84-100% (23, 24). The mean delay in presentation was 3.8 years, which is very similar to earlier reports (23, 30). Thirteen percent of the tumors were clinically identifiable as palpable or visible lumps, highlighting the importance of a thorough head-to-toe examination.
Biochemical investigations revealed hypophosphatemia and normocalcemia in all patients. Hypophosphatemia was severe in 60% of the patients having serum phosphate levels below 0.50nmol/L. Only 43.3% of the cases were vitamin D deficient or insufficient, as opposed to 70-100% of the general population in the Indian subcontinent (31). This is because most of our patients had been supplemented with vitamin D as an empirical treatment at primary care hospitals. The calculated TmP/GFR was low (compared to age- and sex-specific reference range) in all the patients, implying renal phosphate wasting. Serum FGF23 levels were elevated above the upper limit of the

assay range in all but two patients (patients 5 and 20). These two patients had serum FGF23 levels of 102 and 147RU/mL with a corresponding serum phosphate of 0.42 and 0.65nmol/L, respectively, implying `inappropriately normal' FGF23 for the degree of hypophosphatemia (30, 32). Moreover, estimation of FGF23 in our patients was done with C-terminal assay, the sensitivity of which does not reach 100% (33, 34). Other phosphatonins could also be implicated in causing phosphaturia in these two patients (4, 5, 6, 7, 35). We could not find any statistically significant correlation between serum phosphate and FGF23 levels (rs=-0.22, P=0.24), probably because serum phosphate correlates with FGF23 measured by the intact assay rather than by the C-terminal assay (36).
Functional imaging (SSTR-based scintigraphy or FDG-PET) could localize a tracer-avid lesion in 28 out of 29 patients. However subsequent attempt at anatomical localization could pinpoint a culprit lesion in only 25 patients. The concordance rate between SSTR-based scintigraphy and anatomical imaging (defined as the ability of both the imaging modalities to localize a common lesion) was 100%, while concordance between FDG-PET and anatomical imaging was only 50%. The superiority of SSTR-based scintigraphy over FDG-PET in localizing culprit lesions in TIO is well documented in world literature (37, 38, 39). Most of the localized lesions were of soft tissue origin (60%). Forty percent of the tumors were seen to arise from bones, similar to what has been reported in most case series (24, 28). Although recent literature supports no clear anatomical

predilection for the tumors (11), we found a striking lower limb predominance (72%); thighs being the most common site. Two of our patients had multifocal benign tumors (patients 19 and 21), something that has rarely been reported (16, 21, 40, 41). One of them (patient 21), a 42-year-old male (16), had an FDG-avid nodule in the right leg (measuring 0.90.61.0cm) and a synchronous non-FDG-avid nodule in the left thigh that was picked up on MRI (measuring 0.80.7cm). Excision of the FDG-avid nodule did not lead to the resolution of hypophosphatemia. However, when the non-FDG-avid lesion was removed, hypophosphatemia settled, and serum FGF23 came down to 22RU/mL.
Data on tumor size (as noted on CT/MRI) was available in 17 patients. Tumor size and serum phosphate were negatively correlated, though not statistically significant (rs=-0.13, P=0.61); on the contrary, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between tumor size and serum FGF23 levels (rs=0.57, P=0.016), highlighting the fact that tumor size probably dictates the FGF23 levels. Data on maximum standardized uptake volume (SUVmax) from 68Ga-labeled peptide scintigraphy was available in 15 patients. No statistically significant correlation between SUVmax and serum FGF23 levels (rs=-0.17, P=0.51) was found. Since SUVmax is a surrogate marker of SSTR expression (42), it may be inferred that signal transduction via somatostatin receptors is possibly not involved in the regulation of FGF23 secretion by the tumor tissue. As firm evidence to our hypothesis is the

fact that octreotide, a somatostatin receptor ligand, is largely ineffective in correcting the biochemical abnormalities in TIO (43, 44, 45).
All the resected tumors (n=22) were benign in nature. Sixteen of them (72.7%) were found to have phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors (PMT) with the mixed connective tissue variant (PMTMCT) being most commonly seen in 15 patients, while one had an osteoblastoma-like variant. Three patients (13.6%) had hemangiopericytomas while two had giant cell tumors (GCTs) and the other harbored an arteriovenous hemangioma. The present data is consistent with world literature showing a predominance of PMTMCT cases (23, 24).

Although surgery remains the mainstay of therapy, other treatment modalities have been tried with varying degrees of success. Image-guided ablation using different techniques (including percutaneousethanol ablation, radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation) offers a minimally invasive and safe treatment option for patients with inoperable TIO. However efficacy varies, and long-term effects are not known (46, 47, 48). Radiotherapy, as either an adjuvant or a primary treatment modality, remains a viable option for unresectable or incompletely resected tumors (49, 50). Deliberate total parathyroidectomy as a novel treatment approach has also been advocated in refractory cases (2).

Cinacalcet and octreotide have been tried with variable success (51, 52). In addition, anti-FGF23 antibody, also known as KRN23 (Burosumab) is being evaluated for the treatment of TIO (53).
Postoperatively serum phosphorous normalized in 18 out of 22 patients over a period of 3 days to 2 months. Two patients (9.1%) had a local recurrence within 6 months and had to be reoperated. A local recurrence rate of <5% has been reported in world literature (54), mostly in patients harboring a malignant tumor or in whom the operating surgeon was not able to resect the tumor en bloc; the latter being the most likely reason in our two patients. In four patients (18.2%), serum phosphorous never got normalized, and they were believed to have persistent disease. Disease persistence following surgical excision is well documented in literature (55). Repeat SSTR-based scintigraphy in these four patients revealed a new tracer-avid lesion in the right femur in one patient and the right foot of another patient. However, CEMRI was inconclusive. The other two patients had local residues but were unwilling for repeat surgery.
Postoperative FGF23 levels showed a statistically significant decline compared to preoperative values (Fig. 4). However, contrary to our expectations, FGF23 levels did not fall below the upper limit of the reference range of the assay (0-150RU/mL) in four patients with unequivocal evidence of clinical and biochemical cure. This highlights the fact that the percentage decline in FGF23 after surgery, rather than the absolute value, correlates with disease cure. The mean percentage decline in FGF23 that was associated with clinical and biochemical cure was 81.1% (range 27.5%-99.2%).
Serum phosphate in the surgically treated group was significantly higher at their last follow-up compared to the medically managed group (P=0.006) (Fig. 5). However, even within the medically managed group, serum phosphate level at the last follow-up was significantly higher compared to baseline values (P=0.001). Thus, phosphate and calcitriol supplementation in TIO patients, in whom the tumor cannot be localized, does improve biochemical milieu, whether this translates into improved quality of life is however debatable.
The principal strength of the study is the relatively large sample size. Prior case series from India were mostly single center experiences and had included no more than nine patients (15). On the contrary, this was a multicenter study involving 30 patients with cases being recruited from three tertiary care hospitals catering to the northern, western and southern parts of the nation. In addition, somatostatin receptor-based scintigraphy was used in

most of the patients which is the best imaging modality as per published literature. Moreover, an attempt was made to correlate tumor characteristics with serum FGF23 levels (which might bear therapeutic implications) which, to the best of our knowledge, have never been reported earlier. The primary limitation of our study is the fact that not all of our patients underwent surgery; eight patients in whom either the tumor could not be anatomically localized or was unwilling for surgery were put on medical management. Hence, data on tumor histology was not available in these eight patients. Lastly, we measured serum FGF23 levels by C-terminal ELISA technique that measures both intact FGF23 and C-terminal fragments of FGF23. Traditionally it was believed that intact FGF23 was the only biologically active molecule mediating phosphaturia (56). Hence estimation of both intact and C-terminal fragments of FGF23 would theoretically overestimate the actual bioactivity of the circulating molecule.

However, animal studies have shown that carboxyl terminal fragments of FGF23 are phosphaturic (57); the same might hold true for humans as well, and in fact, estimation of FGF23 by C-terminal ELISA might correlate better with bioactivity.
In conclusion, TIO should always be kept as a differential diagnosis while evaluating a patient for osteomalacia. Persistent hypophosphatemia despite normalization of vitamin D status in the absence of a similar family history strengthens the possibility of TIO. A thorough physical examination is always rewarding and might obviate the need for imaging. Serum FGF23 levels may be `inappropriately normal' for the degree of hypophosphatemia. Somatostatin receptor-based scintigraphy should be used as the preferred imaging modality to localize the tumor. Surgical resection offers a definitive cure, however, recurrences do occur and longterm follow-up is necessary.

Abstract

Objective: To establish a rapid, cost-effective, accurate, and acceptable osteoporosis (OP) screening model for the Chinese male population (age  40 years) based on data mining technology. Materials and methods: This was a 3-year retrospective cohort study, which belonged to the sub-cohort of the Chinese Reaction Study. The research period was from March 2011 to December 2014. A total of 1834 subjects who did not have OP at the baseline and completed a 3-year follow-up were included in this study. All subjects underwent quantitative ultrasound examinations for calcaneus at the baseline and follow-ups that lasted for 3 years. We utilized the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model to select feature variables. The characteristic variables selected in the LASSO regression were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression (MLR) to construct the predictive model. This predictive model was displayed through a nomogram. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, C-index, calibration curve, and clinical decision curve analysis (DCA) to evaluate model performance and the bootstrapping validation to internally validate the model. Results: The predictive factors included in the prediction model were age, neck circumference, waist-to-height ratio, BMI, triglyceride, impaired fasting glucose, dyslipidemia, osteopenia, smoking history, and strenuous exercise. The area under the ROC (AUC) curve of the risk nomogram was 0.882 (95% CI, 0.858-0.907), exhibiting good predictive ability and performance. The C-index for the risk nomogram was 0.882 in the prediction model, which presented good refinement. In addition, the nomogram calibration curve indicated that the prediction model was consistent. The DCA showed that when the threshold probability was between 1 and 100%, the nomogram had a good clinical application value. More importantly, the internally verified C-index of the nomogram was still very high, at 0.870. Conclusions: This novel nomogram can effectively predict the 3-year incidence risk of OP in the male population. It also helps clinicians to identify groups at high risk of OP early and formulate personalized intervention measures.

Introduction
Osteoporosis (OP) refers to a systemic bone metabolic syndrome in which bone strength is reduced and bone fragility is increased due to the loss of bone mass and destruction of bone tissue microstructure (1). In the United States, OP affects approximately 10 million people, including 2 million men (2). It is estimated that one in five white men will suffer from osteoporosis-related fractures in their lifetimes (3). In China, the overall prevalence rate of OP in people over 50 years old is 19.2%, and the prevalence rate in men is 6.0% (4); the overall prevalence rate in people with low bone mass who need prevention and treatment is 46.4%, and in men, it is as high as 46.9% (4). China is one of the countries with the largest elderly population in the world (5). Currently, OP has become a major public health issue in China, and it is estimated that by 2050, the number of OP patients will reach 120 million (6). In addition, some studies have found that osteoporotic fractures in men have more serious consequences, and their morbidity and mortality are significantly higher than those in women (7, 8, 9). Unfortunately, the diagnosis rates and treatment rates of males suffering from the OP are insufficient (10).
The research of Si et al. (11) showed that osteoporosisrelated fractures will cause a huge economic burden, and it will increase significantly with the increase of aging. So, the health care system must urgently identify cost-effective screening and intervention measures. OP has become one of the chronic diseases that seriously threaten the health and life safety of middle-aged and elderly people. Dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the gold standard for diagnosing OP. However, due to its high operating costs and inconvenience to carry, it has not yet been popularized among the population. In addition, in some countries and regions with less economic development, screening and testing capabilities OP are even more inadequate. Therefore, in clinical work, it is very important to identify and intercept OP-related risk factors as early as possible.
The current assessment tools that have been adopted for early OP screening are primarily for female patients, and similar effective measurement tools for men are not available. Data mining technology is a new method widely used in disease diagnosis and prediction. In recent years, most methods for disease risk assessment involve data mining. Machine learning (ML), as a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), has been widely applied to solve complex problems in the scientific field (12, 13, 14). Logistic regression (LR) is one of the most commonly used ML techniques in the medical field. It can be used to analyze the risk factors related to the occurrence of a disease and

to construct a clinical prediction model. Among the various models for predicting disease risk, the nomogram transforms the complex regression equation into a simple and visual graph. Its prediction results are highly readable and have very promising clinical application value (15). This study will combine the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and multiple LR analysis incorporate them into data mining technology to establish an OP prediction model and visualize it through a nomogram. To our knowledge, this article is the first study to use a nomogram to predict OP risk factors in male patients and provide guidance for early prevention.
Materials and methods
Participants
This study is a 3-year retrospective cohort study, which is part of the China REACTION study (16). The REACTION study is the largest prospective study of diabetes and cancer in China. From March 2011 to December 2011, we selected 1988 male residents aged 40 and above in Wuyishan City, Fujian Province as the research objects. All subjects were fully informed and voluntarily signed the informed consent form before taking the test. The following cases were excluded: (i) patients who had been diagnosed with OP at baseline (n = 59); (ii) those with missing baseline data (n=80); (iii) those who took drugs that affect bone metabolism within 2 week before the examination (n=0). Finally, 1849 non-OP patients at the baseline were included for a 3-year non-interventional follow-up. The follow-up period was from December 2011 to December 2014. Ultimately, 1834 participants completed the second survey and were included in the study. The follow-up response rate was 99.2%, and the detailed research flow chart is shown in Fig. 1. At present, the study has been approved by the ethics committee of Fujian Provincial Hospital (ID: K2020-10-002).
Data collection
All patients completed a questionnaire survey. The survey content included age, past medical history (hypertension, diabetes, prediabetes, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), dyslipidemia, obesity, abdominal obesity, osteopenia, fractures), personal history (histories of smoking, drinking, and tea consumption), and dietary habits (pork, beef, mutton, chicken, duck,

goose, seafood, dairy products, soy products). Exercise intensity was divided into three levels: light exercises (such as walking), moderate exercises (such as jogging, playing ping pong, and practicing tai chi), and strenuous exercises (such as playing basketball, swimming, and running), each having to last for more than 10 min. Past medical history had been clearly diagnosed by specialists from second-level and above hospitals. Smoking was divided into no (including never smoked or ex-smokers) and yes

(current smokers); alcohol consumption was categorized as no (including never drank or previous drinkers) and yes (currently drinking). Tea consumption history was divided into three parts: frequent (more than three times a week), occasionally (one to three times a week), and never. Blood samples with fasting for more than 8 h were extracted to detect for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), alanine

aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and uric acid (UA). All subjects underwent oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial plasma glucose (2hPG) were measured at fasting and 2 h after a glucose load. The glucose oxidase method was utilized to determine blood glucose. An automatic biochemical analyzer (Modular E170, Roche) was used to detect blood lipids, and liver and kidney functionalities. HbA1c was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (automated glycohemoglobin analyzer, Bio-Rad).
The height, weight, waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), neck circumference (NC), pulse, and blood pressure (BP) were measured by uniformly trained investigators. The subjects wore thin shirts and stood upright on the bottom plate of a stadiometer to measure their height and weight. WC was measured at the thinnest part of the waist (the horizontal circumference of the waist through the umbilical point), and NC was measured at the thinnest part of the middle of the neck. HC was measured at the most convex part of the pubic symphysis and gluteus maximums. BMI was then calculated by weight (kg)/height (m2), and the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) was calculated by WC (cm)/height (cm). The waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was calculated by WC (cm)/hip(cm), and BP and pulse were measured after the subjects rested for 10 min. An electronic sphygmomanometer (Omron) was used to measure BP and pulse three times, and the average value was taken as the data analysis. Calcaneus quantitative ultrasound (QUS) was used to measure bone mineral density (BMD) by the Achilles Express ultrasonic bone densitometer (GE Lunar Corp., Madison, WI, USA). The SI-derived T-score was the parameter we used to assess BMD. T-score could be obtained directly from the Achilles Express ultrasonic bone densitometer. And, we used the standard provided by the manufacturer as a reference to evaluate the T-score. The manufacturer's standards were based on a database of young, healthy Chinese individuals in the same study area as the reference. The QUS instrument was calibrated daily according to the manufacturer's recommendations before measurement. Data collection and analysis were performed by two collaborators (Yaqian Mao and Lizhen Xu); divergences were resolved through discussion.
Diagnostic and classification criteria
According to the diagnostic criteria from the World Health Organization (WHO) (17), the definition of osteopenia is -2.5 < T-score <-1, and the definition for OP is T-score

 -2.5. In our study, according to the diagnostic criteria from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) in 2003 (18), the definition of diabetes is FPG  7.0 mmol/L and/or 2hPG  11.1 mmol/L; the definition for IFG is 6.1 mmol/L  FPG <7.0 mmol/L, and 2 hPG < 7.8 mmol/L; the definition for IGT is FPG < 7.0 mmol/L, and 2 hPG  7.8 mmol/L or <11.1 mmol/L; prediabetes including IFG and IGT. The definition for centric obesity is defined as (19, 20, 21): male WC  90 cm, male WHR  0.9, WHtR  0.5. We defined NC  35 cm as centric obesity.
Statistical analysis
R software (version 4.0.2; https://www.r-project.org) and IBM SPSS software (version 25.0 for windows, SPSS Inc.) were implemented for data analysis. Missing data were filled in by multiple interpolations (22). Categorical variables were shown as a percentage. Baseline data analysis was used by chi-square test, and the value of P < 0.05 (two-sided) was considered statistically significant. In the construction of the predictive model, we used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis to screen out characteristic variables with nonzero coefficients. The glmnet package in the R software was used to run LASSO. LASSO regression analysis causes the regression coefficients of some variables to approach zero by imposing constraints on the model parameters, thereby minimizing prediction errors. It uses the control parameter lambda for variable screening and complexity adjustments and is particularly suitable for high-dimensional data analysis and risk factor screening (23, 24). Then, MLR analysis was adopted to analyze the characteristic variables with nonzero coefficients. These characteristic variables in the MLR model were represented by a regressive coefficient (), odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI, and P-value. The rms package in R software was used to run LR. LR is the most adopted technique in ML (25), which often analyzes the risk factors of disease and builds risk prediction models.
We verified the model performance, accuracy, and practicality through C-index, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration charts. Bootstrapping validation (1000 Bootstrap Resamples) calculated a relatively corrected C-index (26), and we used the ROCR package of R language to perform the ROC. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) can adequately distinguish performances across the risk spectrum (27). We used the rms package to draw the calibration curve, which was plotted to assess the calibration of the OP nomogram (28). Also, the R language rmda package

was applied for the clinical decision curve analysis. DCA is a novel method for evaluating predictive models, which can be used to evaluate the clinical utility of the model (29).
Results
Patient characteristics of the study cohort
This was a 3-year retrospective cohort study. The detailed research process is shown in Fig. 1. A total of 1834 baseline non-OP male patients completed this follow-up with a completion rate of 1834/1849 (99.2%). All patients have completed the relevant examinations. A total of 187 patients developed OP after 3 years (10.2%), aged 41-79 years. Supplementary Table 1 (see section on supplementary materials given at the end of this article) for the BMD value (T-score) of 1834 male patients who completed the 3-year follow-up. We defined these 187 male patients who developed OP as the OP group and 1647 male patients who had not developed OP as the non-OP group. The comparison of characteristic variables between OP group and non-OP group are shown in Table 1.
Feature selection
The variables in our study included demographic characteristics, anthropometric characteristics, blood biochemical indicators, auxiliary examinations, co-morbidities, and lifestyles. We selected 10 characteristic variables with nonzero coefficients from 44 variables through the LASSO regression model, including age, neck circumference, waist-to-height ratio, BMI, TG, IFG, dyslipidemia, osteopenia, smoking history, and strenuous exercises (see Fig. 2 for details).
Development of individualized prediction nomogram
We employed the feature variables selected from the LASSO regression model to construct the prediction model. The predictive model construction will use the multiple LR method (see Table 2 for details), and the predictive model constructed by the aforementioned predictors was represented by a nomogram (see Fig. 3 for details).
Model validation and clinical use
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the risk nomogram was 0.882 (95% CI, 0.858-0.907) (Fig. 4A), which suggested

that the model had adequate predictive capabilities and performance. The C-index for the prediction model in the cohort was 0.882 (95% CI, 0.858-0.907) and was 0.870 by bootstrapping validation, indicating that the model had good refinement. Figure 4B shows the clinical DCA for the risk nomogram. The DCA shows that if the threshold probability of the DCA is >1 and <100%, using this risk nomogram to predict the 3-year risk for OP was beneficial in clinical work. Figure 4C shows the calibration curve for the risk nomogram, which exhibited good consistency in this cohort.
Discussion
OP is often considered a health problem for females, but its effects on males are often overlooked. In order to prevent and evaluate OP, various OP risk assessment tools have gradually appeared and developed. Taking the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) as an example, which is currently the most widely used standard for evaluating bone health. FRAX was released by the WHO Collaborating Center in Sheffield, UK, in 2008 to assess the individualized probability of hip and major osteoporotic fractures in 10 years (30). FRAX is a questionnaire-based scoring tool, and its reference indicators include clinical risk factors and femoral neck BMD (30). Due to regional differences, lack of appropriate cohort data, and design flaws, some studies have found that FRAX has limitations in clinical use (31, 32, 33, 34). The study of Harvey et al. (35) showed that the accuracy of using FRAX to predict fracture risk in men may be lower than in women. At present, the risk factors for OP in male patients are still unclear, and targeted and personalized assessment tools are insufficient. Based on the data from the epidemiological surveys, we constructed a nomogram of the 3-year incidence risk of OP for Chinese adult males to provide a quantitative forecasting tool for the early identification of OP high-risk groups. Our research found that age, BMI, NC, WHtR, TG, IFG, dyslipidemia, osteopenia, smoking history, and strenuous exercise were risk factors for OP in males.
The risk factors related to OP occurrence in our study were similar to most previous studies. However, the difference is the statistical analysis method used. Most previous studies (36, 37, 38) usually used singlefactor analysis to initially screen risk factors and then implemented multi-factor stepwise regression to obtain significant variables. In this study, we implemented new statistical methods to identify OP risk factors and explained the issues from multiple perspectives while exploring

the risk factors for chronic diseases. The disadvantage inherent to this traditional variable selection is that the variance in the model is generally higher, and flexibility is poor. While exploring disease risk factors, there are generally multiple independent variables. If all variables are used, model overfitting is likely to occur. Meanwhile, the multicollinearity problem must be considered. A major breakthrough in regression analysis in recent years is the introduction of regularized regression, namely the LASSO regression (23, 39, 40). The most prominent advantage of LASSO regression is that by applying penalized regression to all variable coefficients, the relatively unimportant independent variable coefficients become zero and are thus excluded from modeling (23). In addition, LASSO regression is suitable for any data type and for reducing high-dimensional data (23). LASSO regression can perform variable screening and complexity adjustments while fitting a generalized linear model. Different from previous studies, our study used LASSO regression to screen OP risk factors and used the traditional LR regression method to build the model (23). The research results showed that the model constructed with the variables screened by the LASSO regression has good accuracy and predictive ability.
Currently, most studies (37, 38, 41, 42) on OP risk factors were cross-sectional surveys. The cross-sectional

survey can only be used as a preliminary screening tool to assess the current OP risk but cannot predict OP risk in the future. In addition, most studies have proven that QUS is useful for predicting fracture risk in women (43, 44, 45). However, there are still few prospective data on QUS and OP risk in men. At present, the largest study today in men is MrOS study, a multi-center prospective study of risk factors for fracture in 5995 older men (46, 47). In order to explore the risk factors for OP in Chinese male patients, we conducted this survey. This study is a retrospective cohort study based on 3-year follow-up data. The analysis is explained subsequently.
Age, osteopenia, and OP
There is no doubt that age is a definitive risk factor for OP. Our research indicated that as age increased, OP risk gradually increased alongside it, which was consistent with most previous studies (37, 38). The bone loss caused by age is related to the following factors (48). First, as age increases, the level of sex hormones in the body decreases; however, sex hormones are key to maintaining bone mass. Secondly, as age increases, skeletal muscle mass decreases and muscle fat accumulates, leading to decreases in muscle strength and muscle functions, which promotes bone loss

and decreasing bone density. Osteopenia is an early state of OP, and our study found that patients with osteopenia have a significantly increased risk of developing OP after 3

years. Therefore, active treatment and intervention while diagnosed with osteopenia before OP can occur reduce OP risk after 3 years.

BMI, central obesity, and OP
Previous studies (49) have shown that for both men and postmenopausal women, BMI, fat mass, and lean mass are conducive to increasing BMD. The study of Yang et al. (37) found that central obesity, BMI, and the prevalence of male OP were closely related. The studies from Wu et al. (50) and Lloyd et al. (42) also support this view, indicating that there is a strong negative correlation between BMI and OP. The above findings are consistent with our research. The protective effect of high BMI against OP is considered to be related to weight gain. The greater the body weight, the greater the mechanical load on the bones, which contributes to an increase in bone mass (51). On the contrary, the study of Zhao et al. (52) showed that increased fat mass may not benefit bone mass. Now, more and more studies have confirmed that higher fat mass may be an independent risk factor for OP and osteoporotic fractures.
TG, dyslipidemia, and OP
The relationship between blood lipids and OP has always been controversial. Hsu et al. (41) discovered that after adjusting for body weight, fat mass, and other confounding factors, a significant negative correlation exists between body bone mineral content (BMC) and TC, TG, and LDL. Another study from Poli et al. (53) found that after adjusting for BMI and age, postmenopausal women with high plasma LDL levels have a higher risk for osteopenia. On the contrary, a cohort study (54) conducted in Italy showed that both female and male body and buttocks BMD

were closely related to blood lipids. HDL-C was negatively correlated with BMD, while TG, TC, and LDL-C were positively correlated with BMD. The study of Loke et al. (55) found that in female patients, HDL-C and BMD were positively correlated, while in males, the opposite was true. In this study, we found that patients with dyslipidemia and high TG levels had a reduced risk for OP. It is worth noting that patients with abnormal blood lipid profiles are often accompanied by higher BMI levels. The positive effects of mechanical pressure may conceal the relationship between blood lipids and BMD (56). Therefore, when analyzing the relationship between blood lipid profiles and OP, BMI should be considered.
IFG and OP
At present, controversies abound regarding the relationship between T2DM and BMD. Some studies (57, 58, 59, 60) suggest that type 2 diabetes is associated with low BMD; a few report normal BMD; a few report increased BMD. Our study found that patients with impaired fasting blood glucose had an increased risk for OP. A study (61) from Japan reported that in elderly men in the community, there was a linear correlation between high blood sugar and increased fracture risk. Maddaloni et al. (62) found that serum osteocalcin levels negatively correlated with HbA1c, indicating that poor blood glucose control would affect osteoblast functionality. A study from Parajuli et al. (63) also found that hyperglycemia can damage bones and mechanical load response. Therefore, actively controlling blood sugar has a positive effect on preventing OP.
Exercise, smoking, and OP
Multiple studies (64, 65, 66, 67) have confirmed that exercise is beneficial to health, including reducing falls and fractures. The meta-analysis from Zhao et al. (64) found that combined exercise intervention was effective in preventing bone density loss in postmenopausal women, and another from Xu et al. (65) showed that lifelong exercise for different ages was an effective way to maintain bone health in girls and women. The aforementioned studies (64, 65, 66, 67) were limited to female patients. The research from Wainstein et al. (68) found that regular physical activity might improve BMD in men. Another study from Korea (69) also found that appropriate exercise might decrease the risk for low BMD in elderly men, which is consistent with our study. Our research has found that weight-bearing exercise can prevent male OP to a certain extent. It should

be noted that for some patients, such as patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, exercise can increase the risk of falls. Therefore, doctors should formulate targeted health plans based on the risks to each patient individually. There is no doubt that smoking is harmful to the body. Most evidence (36, 37) suggests that smoking can reduce BMD in women and men, thereby increasing the risk of OP, which is consistent with our study.
Limitations
However, this paper still has the following shortcomings: First, QUS was used to measure bone density in this study, instead of DXA, the gold standard for diagnosing OP. But QUS has several advantages, such as portability, low cost, and ease of operation, making it more suitable for large epidemiological investigations. Secondly, the definition of OP and osteopenia in our study refers to the diagnostic criteria of WHO. Obviously, this will reduce the accuracy of diagnosis. Therefore, the BMD estimated by calcaneal QUS is suitable for the construction of predictive models rather than diagnostic models. In addition, patients diagnosed with OP by QUS of the calcaneus need to be further clarified by DXA in future research. Thirdly, model validation is achieved through bootstrapping validation in internal validation, which needs to be verified by external validation in future research.
Conclusion
Global research on OP primarily focuses on female patients, while there are few studies on male patients. Our study established a highly accurate nomogram to predict the 3-year incidence risk of OP in male patients. By assessing individual risks, clinicians can formulate effective interventions for patients and provide health education according to their lifestyles, diets, and exercise patterns.

Abstract
Objective: More than a third of women diagnosed with breast cancer in England, and over half of those who die from it, are over 70. The Be Clear on Cancer Breast Cancer in Women over 70 Campaign, running three times, 2014-2018, aimed to promote early diagnosis of breast cancer in England by raising symptom awareness and encouraging women to see their general practitioner (GP) without delay. We sought to establish whether the third campaign had successfully met its aims. Methods: Metrics covering the patient pathway, including symptom awareness, attending a GP practice with symptoms, urgent GP referral, diagnosis and stage of cancer, were assessed using national cancer databases and two household surveys. Results: The third campaign was associated with an increase in urgent cancer referrals, and therefore mammograms and ultrasounds performed. This was associated with an increase in breast cancers diagnosed. There was a delayed effect on GP attendances. Awareness of breast cancer prevalence for the 70-and-over age group improved. Impact on these metrics diminished across successive campaigns. Conclusions: Future campaigns should focus on harder-to-reach women and include GPs as targets as this campaign showed a potential to affect referral behaviour.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women in England, with around 185,000 women diagnosed between 2014 and 2018 (National Audit of Breast Cancer in Older Patients, 2020). Of these, over a third were aged 70 years or over (National Audit of Breast

Cancer in Older Patients, 2020; Public Health England, 2020c) and over half the 9500 women in England who died from BC (Office for National Statistics, 2019b). Survival is lower in older women even when adjusted for increased overall mortality. The decrease in survival with stage is also greatest in older women (Office for National Statistics, 2019a). Lower survival rates in older women may be

explained by advanced stage on average in older groups, possibly due to poorer knowledge of non-lump BC symptoms or delay visiting their general practitioner (GP) upon discovering symptoms (Linsell et al., 2008). Furthermore, physicians may overlook or misinterpret symptoms (Hafstrm et al., 2011). Additionally, women diagnosed symptomatically rather than through screening are more likely to have breast cancer subtypes with poorer outcomes, while women diagnosed through screening are more likely to have luminal A disease, which has a better prognosis (Crispo et al., 2013). Moreover, older women are less likely to receive treatment for BC, which affects outcomes (Gaitanidis et al., 2018). Delay in the presentation of BC of 3 months or more can result in diagnosis with later-stage disease and reduced chances of survival (Williams, 2015). Routes to BC diagnosis are influenced by age, as only women aged 50-70 years are routinely invited for population-based screening and women outside of that age range must request a breast-screening appointment (National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, 2021). Cancer awareness is still important in the over-70 age group as absolute risk of breast cancer increases with age.
Better knowledge of symptoms can reduce delays in help-seeking for cancer symptoms; therefore, behaviour change campaigns may increase knowledge of BC symptoms in women over 70 and to encourage them to present to their GP with symptoms (Petrova et al., 2020). Mass media campaigns can produce positive changes in health-related behaviours and are a useful component of comprehensive approaches to improving population health behaviours (Wakefield et al., 2010).
The `Be Clear on Cancer' (BCoC) programme is an overarching campaign with specific campaigns for different cancers. BCoC aims to promote the early diagnosis of cancer in England by raising public awareness of its signs and symptoms, and to encourage people to see their GP without delay (Public Health England, 2020a). BCoC is led by Public Health England (PHE), in partnership with the Department of Health and Social Care, and National Health Service (NHS) England. The BCoC Breast Cancer in Women over 70 (BCW70) campaign was first piloted in 2012, running nationally in 2014, 2015 and 2018. Objectives included increasing BC knowledge in women over 70 that they were still at risk, that a lump is not the only sign, that early detection makes BC more treatable and they visit their GP if they noticed signs or symptoms. The campaigns were promoted through multiple channels, including television, press and screens in GP waiting rooms, online advertising, direct mailing of letters and leaflets and a campaign website.
Evaluation of these successive campaigns demonstrated objective increases in awareness of the campaign messages, and an increase in patients diagnosed immediately following the campaign (National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, 2014). The BCoC campaigns influenced help-seeking by patients and referral patterns by GPs, with some impact on diagnosis (both incidence and stage), although no clear evidence on survival (Lai et al., 2020). The third campaign differed from the first two in that it was run on a reduced budget, which resulted in reaching fewer women than the earlier campaigns.

This paper reports an evaluation of the third BCoC BCW70 campaign. We assess the extent to which the third campaign influenced the target demographic, whether it met the aims and objectives, and compares the third national campaign to the two earlier campaigns. Clinical metrics and the impact on public awareness and attitudes towards help-seeking for BC symptoms are examined.
2 | METHODS
2.1 | Campaign overview
The third national BCW70 campaign ran from 22 February 2018 to 31 March 2018 in England. A communication framework, based on a modified version of the Government Communications Standards, was designed by PHE Marketing and Wavemaker, an external media planning agency (Wavemaker, 2018). The framework consisted of three stages: Alert, Motivate and Support (see Figure 1). Further details on the campaign can be found on the BCoC website (Public Health England, 2020b).
2.2 | Data sources and metrics
All data used in this study were anonymous and acquired from external sources. No primary data collection or participant recruitment was undertaken by the study team. Participants in the symptom awareness survey were sampled from a cohort of a market and social research agency (Kantar Ltd), and all had given prior consent to be approached for such surveys and to have their responses shared with third parties. All remaining data were acquired from publicly owned, anonymised datasets. As such, ethical approval for this study was not sought.
The main data sources used for the metrics were The Health Improvement Network (THIN), National Cancer Waiting Times Monitoring Data Set and Diagnostic Imaging Dataset. Data were collected for a series of metrics covering the patient pathway from symptom awareness, attending a GP practice with relevant symptoms, urgent GP referral through to diagnosis of cancer and stage at diagnosis. The analysis for each metric compared the period during/shortly after the campaign (analysis period) to the same period in the previous year (comparison period). The analysis and comparison periods are slightly different for each metric due to when we might expect an impact of the campaign to occur (National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, n.d.). For example, a cancer diagnosis would not be expected until at least 2 weeks after the first presentation at the GP (see Table 1).
2.2.1 | Symptom awareness/attitudes to help-seeking
To evaluate the impact of the campaign on symptom awareness and attitudes to help-seeking, face-to-face interviews at home were

undertaken by a social research agency (Kantar, 2020). Participants were randomly recruited with set quotas for specific demographics (age, geographic location, sociodemographic status and employment status) to ensure that respondents were representative of the target population (women aged 70 and over). Different participants were used for the pre- and post-campaign surveys, ensuring similar demographic profiles for each by quota sampling matched by weighting to match population statistics (see Table 2). Verbal consent was obtained at the start of the interview. Questionnaires were developed in previous BCoC campaigns (Lai et al., 2020) and adapted for the third BCW70 campaign to be appropriate for the campaign objectives, which changed slightly for each campaign.
Pre-campaign data collection occurred between 2 and 20 February 2018, and post-campaign data collection occurred between 6 April and 1 May 2018.
2.2.2 | Clinical metrics

GP attendances, the number of GP practices contributing data into THIN (The Health Improvement Network, 2021) each week was added as an offset to the model; therefore, the results are presented as count per practice. For symptom awareness/attitude to helpseeking and early-stage at diagnosis, counts were aggregated, and proportions calculated for the comparison and analysis periods. The percentage change between the two periods was calculated, and p values estimated using a two-sample test of proportions. Trends in counts and proportions over time were analysed using visual displays, with data covering 2017 to 2018. All statistical tests were two-sided, and p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analysis was conducted in Stata 16 (StataCorp, 2019).
3 | RESULTS
The following results are for women aged 70 years and over and refer to the rate in the analysis period compared to the comparison period as defined above, unless stated otherwise (Table 1).

Table 1 provides details on data sources, temporal groupings of the data and inclusion criteria for each clinical metric.

2.3 | Statistical analysis
Analyses included women aged 70 years and over. The outcome metrics including weekly or monthly counts (except early-stage at diagnosis) were analysed using Poisson regression or negative binomial regression with one binary variable for the comparison and analysis period. Results are presented as total counts in each period, the estimated rate ratio (analysis period compared to the comparison period) with 95% confidence intervals and associated p-values. For

There was a significant 6.0% (95% CI: 1.1% to 10.9%) increase in the proportion of respondents who identified that one in three BCs are diagnosed in women over 70 each year (p value = 0.019). There was a significant 9.3% (95% CI: 16.8% to 1.8%) decrease in the proportion of respondents who identified `pain in the breast' as a warning sign of breast cancer (p value = 0.017).
There was no post-campaign increase in the proportion of respondents correctly identifying that a `lump or thickening in the breast or armpit', `change(s) to the nipple(s)', `change(s) to the skin of the breast(s)', `change in the shape or size or feel of the breasts' or

`nipple discharge' could be a symptom of BC (all p > 0.05). However, awareness of these symptoms was high pre-campaign, ranging from 65.5% for `change(s) to the skin of the breast(s)' to 84.5% for `lump or thickening in the breast or armpit'.

Before the campaign, most patients believed that they would be too embarrassed to talk to their GP about BC symptoms (87.4%), were worried about wasting the doctor's time (85.3%) or scared to know that they have BC (48.6%). These proportions were not

significantly different after the campaign. The proportion of women who did not believe that their `GP/doctor would be difficult to talk to about the signs and symptoms of breast cancer' increased significantly by 8.3% (95% CI 1.5% to 15.1%) from 21.9% before the campaign to 30.3% after the campaign (p = 0.019; see Table 3).
3.2 | GP attendances

second campaigns had greater impact on respondents' attitudes towards help-seeking, with more respondents disagreeing with unfavourable attitudes. However, there was a decrease in respondents strongly disagreeing.
Table S2 provides a comparison of clinical metrics (all metrics apart from symptom awareness and attitudes to help-seeking) for all three national campaigns. The first campaign appeared to have the greatest impact on all metrics analysed, except for breast carcinoma in situ diagnosed; the RR was highest for the third campaign. The impacts of the second and third campaigns were attenuated but prevailed for most metrics.
The impact on urgent GP referrals for breast symptoms and cancers diagnosed from an urgent GP referral for breast symptoms was no longer statistically significant after the first two campaigns. There were no increases in the proportion of cancers diagnosed at an early stage for any campaign.
4 | DISCUSSION
4.1 | Clinical metrics
The third BCW70 campaign influenced urgent GP referrals for suspected BC, BC diagnosed from an urgent GP referral, BCs diagnosed and mammograms and ultrasounds performed. GP attendance for breast symptoms increased after the analysis period (during the post-campaign analysis period), suggesting a delayed, but unexpected, effect of the campaign on this metric. The main outcome of the campaign was an increase in urgent cancer referrals and diagnosed BCs.
There was an increase in urgent cancer referrals, suspected BCs diagnosed from such referrals and mammograms and ultrasounds performed across all three national campaigns, probably because more women were referred. However, increases observed after the first campaign diminished over subsequent campaigns. The reduced impact of the third campaign may be due to a lower media spend and no public relations activity, and diminished returns in the wake of the previous two campaigns. An increase in referrals (Bethune et al., 2013; Broggio & Francis, 2015; Kabir & Khoo, 2016; Lai et al., 2020) and cancers diagnosed from them (Broggio & Francis, 2015; Lai et al., 2020) have also been found for other BCoC campaigns. Increases in mammograms and ultrasounds were most likely due to increased referrals (and therefore attendance) to secondary care.
Unlike urgent cancer referrals, urgent referrals for breast symptoms were unaffected by the third campaign, despite increases after the first and second campaigns. This may be related to overall downward trends for these referral types, through changes in the referral guidelines from 2015 (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2021); furthermore, the two referral types are related, with a decision having to be made between the suspected BC and breast symptoms routes. Thus, increases in the referral route for suspected BC may partly stem from cases which might previously have been referred as breast symptoms. It is therefore perhaps

unsurprising that there was no effect on GP referrals for more general breast symptoms in the final campaign, despite an increase following the first and second campaigns.
As delays in presenting to the GP with symptoms are associated with lower survival (Richards et al., 1999), it is important to examine how campaign messaging should be tailored to improve GP attendance. A mixed-methods approach combining quantitative with qualitative methods would allow deeper exploration than survey data alone. Nonetheless, cancers diagnosed from urgent GP referrals for suspected BC increased over all three campaigns, though this diminished with successive campaigns. This suggests that the campaigns influenced GP referral patterns even though there was only a delayed increase in GP attendance rates after the campaign had ended. The increase in referrals indicates that GPs may have been receptive to the BCoC campaign. Thus, the campaign may have led to changes in GPs' behaviour, rather than more women coming forward for assessment. As much of the campaign took place in GP surgeries and was intended to alert to BC risk, this is understandable. Future research could explore this by assessing awareness of the campaign and its messages in GPs, before and after the campaign.
BC diagnoses increased across all three campaigns, in line with other BCoC campaigns (Lai et al., 2020). Breast carcinoma in situ diagnoses increased following the third campaign but not following the first or second campaigns. This may be because of the increase in mammography in the older age group. There was no evidence that the proportion of early-stage malignant BC diagnoses was affected by any of the three campaigns.
4.2 | Symptom awareness and attitudes to helpseeking
Several changes were observed in relation to awareness of BC risk, symptoms and attitudes towards help-seeking from one's GP for BC symptoms. Regarding BC risk and age, following the third campaign, there was a significant increase in women who accurately estimated that one in three women over 70 were at risk of developing BC. Thus, the third campaign improved women's risk perception in this age group, especially when compared to the first and second campaigns, which did not influence risk perception.
In relation to recognising warning signs of BC, a significant decrease in recognition was observed for pain in the breast--not normally a symptom of BC, and rarely a cause for referral in the elderly--following the third campaign, but not for other symptoms. However, symptom awareness before the campaign was already high.
Attitudes towards help-seeking from the GP were unaffected by the third campaign, although as attitudes were positive to begin with for all campaigns, this finding is unsurprising. Given the lack of change in symptom awareness, the observed increase in GP attendances warrants further investigation. Concerns about talking to the GP about signs and symptoms of BC improved after the third campaign, and fewer women stated they had these concerns. Moreover, fewer women felt that they would not want to know, or be scared to know,

EBERHARDT ET AL.

if they had BC, indicating that there had been a slight increase in fear and/or denial of symptoms. Overall, attitudes towards help-seeking from GPs were still overwhelmingly positive, with 80%-90% of respondents not being worried about wasting their GP's time and not being embarrassed or afraid to see their GP for symptoms. However, denial, fear and negative attitudes towards GPs can act as barriers towards help-seeking for BC symptoms (Bish et al., 2005; O'Mahony et al., 2011). As GP attendances for breast symptoms only increased following the second campaign, further research is needed to determine alternative methods of encouraging women to see their GP, particularly for those exhibiting fear, denial and/or concerns over contacting their GPs.
4.3 | Strengths and limitations
The BCW70 campaign represents a substantial effort to raise public awareness and effect behaviour change. The campaign was designed in consultation with GPs and a panel of expert representatives from public health, primary and secondary care, the charity sector and academic research (Public Health England, 2020b).
The campaign affected several clinical metrics, as well as some aspects of public awareness of BC in women over 70. However, several limitations need to be acknowledged. First, the evaluation used existing routinely-collected datasets not specifically designed to address the research aims. Only two time points were considered, so the results must be interpreted with this in mind. Future campaigns may benefit from expert clinical advisory groups during conception and planning, to identify outcomes of most value, how to measure these reliably and how to assess changes in them. Second, clinical metrics may have been affected by clinical trials occurring at the same time as the campaign. For example, the NHS-led AgeX trial (Moser et al., 2011), which extended the age group of women invited for BC screening to include women aged 47-49 and 71-73, may have influenced BC diagnoses in the period covered by the three campaigns, as some of these women were perhaps diagnosed through screening who previously would have presented symptomatically to the GP. Third, behavioural factors may also have affected the results. Symptom awareness does not necessarily lead to (timely) GP attendance (Bish et al., 2005; O'Mahony et al., 2011). For example, downplaying symptoms or prioritising life events over seeing a physician can lead to older women delaying symptom presentation to healthcare (Petrova et al., 2020). A BC diagnosis does not always result in treatment, as this may not always be clinically appropriate, or even wanted by the patient (Frenkel, 2013). A decision to treat should involve balancing of risk and benefit, considering relevant co-morbidities. Finally, no data were available on the duration of BC symptoms before seeing the GP, and whether this appointment was motivated by the campaign. If symptoms were present long before the campaign, there would have been no opportunity for an early diagnosis attributable to the campaign. However, even for women with BC, earlier treatment through being motivated by the campaign to seek help may have at least resulted in benefits such as improved quality of life--

again, there are currently no data which would allow an investigation of this possibility.
4.4 | Impact across all three campaigns
Examining the impact across all three campaigns, for some metrics-- GP attendances, urgent GP referrals and suspected breast cancers diagnosed from these referrals--effects diminished with each successive campaign. This is corresponds to other BCoC campaigns (National Cancer Registration and & Analysis Service, 2018; National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, 2020). Effects on other metrics--cancers diagnosed from urgent GP breast symptom referrals, and some of the cancer diagnoses in CWT database--diminished in the second campaign, only to increase again in the third campaign, although they did not return to post-first campaign levels. While the diminished effects of the third campaign may be partly attributable to the reduced budget and reduced reach, any effect the first campaign had on individuals would not be repeated for the same individual with each subsequent campaign. Those most receptive to the campaign messages are likely to have been influenced by the earlier campaigns, leaving fewer people for successive campaigns to influence, leading to diminishing returns due to saturation. More time between campaigns could have led to these reaching a new audience who had no breast symptoms when the previous campaign had run or had moved into the target age group between campaigns. Future work should therefore identify why some women were less receptive to the BCoC campaign messages than others.
As discussed above, denial, fear and negative attitudes towards GPs are potential factors for diminished effect (Bish et al., 2005; O'Mahony et al., 2011), but there may be others. Future campaigns should consider different methods to influence those who are more difficult to reach, and how to sustain the effects of the campaigns. Finally, while the positive findings are encouraging, these findings may have been influenced by factors that were not measured or assessed. Further research, using mixed methods to allow deeper exploration, is needed to determine causal relationships between campaigns such as the present one, and clinical and public awareness outcomes.
5 | CONCLUSIONS
The third BCW70 campaign was associated with an increase in GP referrals, diagnostics in secondary care and malignant BCs and breast carcinoma in situ diagnosed, although GP attendance for breast symptoms was not significantly affected during the campaign. Examining all three BCoC BCW70 campaigns, their impact diminished successively, as is the case for other national BCoC campaigns. To maximise their chances of success in terms of increasing GP attendance, future campaigns should focus on harder-to-reach women, for example, those who react with fear, avoidance or denial to the campaign messages. Furthermore, targeting GPs in future

ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS.
The President and Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons held their first conversazione for the season in their large hall, on Friday evening, Dec. 5th. It was numerously attended by the members of the College, andinvitations had been issued to the Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians, and to the members of the medical profession generally. Dr Andrew Wood, P.R.C.S., presided, and welcomed the guests, which included the Lord Provost, Dr Maclagan, President of the Royal College of Physicians, Dr Deas, C.B., Dr Archibald Gordon, C.B., Mr Lister, sen., Professors Christison, Syme, Goodsir, Allman, Bennett, and Balfour, Staff-Surgeon Anderson, Bailie Blackadder, Bailie Grieve, Dean of Guild Wemyss, Mr R. Chambers, etc. The President, in opening the proceedings, referred to the great success which had attended their meetings in this hall last winter, to which they had in turn invited the leading members of all the various literary and scientific professions. The series, now to be commenced, promised to be fully as interesting and attractive, and he had great pleasure in announcing that, among those to whom they would have the pleasure of listening in the course of the season were, Professor George Wilson, Professor Allen Thomson of Glasgow, Professor Balfour, and their Conservator, Dr Sanders.
The lectui'e of the evening was delivered by Joseph Lister, Esq., F.R.C.S., Eng. and Edin., Assistant-Surgeon to the Royal Infirmary, and Lecturer on Surgery, " On the Early Stages of Inflammation, as observed in the Foot of the Frog."
After alluding shortly to the structure of the blood vessels and the nature of the blood, Mr Lister discussed at considerable length the physiology of the circulation, lie next gave a sketch of the opinions of the principal authorities

regarding the appearances presented by the web of the frog's foot under circumstances of irritation ; and then proceeded to describe various experiments and observations of his own, which had led him to the inference, that inflammation consists essentially in diminution of the functional activity of a part, and that the effects upon the blood are secondary phenomena. Mr Lister illustrated his statements with numerous diagrams, enlarged from his original
sketches.
Professor Goodsir, in proposing a vote of thanks to the lecturer, spoke in high terms of the originality and importance of his observations and conclusions, and expressed his belief that they had that evening had but the first fruits of those hereditary powers which Mr Lister undoubtedly possessed, and which must enable him not only to take a high position as a man of science, but also to add to the reputation of the school with which he had connected
himself.
Professor Bennett seconded the motion in complimentary terms. The thanks of the meeting were accordingly conveyed to Mr Lister by the President. The company then withdrew to the adjoining hall, where tea and coffee were served, and separated about half-past ten.

forming, as they do, a photographic record of all the stages of the
disease.
Unfortunately, the account of smallpox given in the letterpress is somewhat incomplete. Dr. Fox makes no mention of etiological or pathological questions, and his description of the symptomatology of the fever is very brief, and appears to us to be insufficient for the requirements of the student. He only mentions the course of the temperature incidentally, and it is surprising to find a book, so magnificently illustrated, without a single temperature chart to give an idea of the primary and secondary fevers. On the other hand, the section on treatment is very good and practical, and is full of common-sense advice. A very adequate account of vaccination finishes the book.
2. In his very short monograph Dr. Wallace has made use of Dr. Savill's very complete report of the smallpox epidemic of 1892-3 in Warrington. The public health aspect of the question is carefully considered, and the figures relating to vaccination and revaccination are admirably and clearly arranged. As regards the question of the aerial convection of the poison, Dr. Wallace shows that this theory is not supported by the experience at Warrington, where indeed the greatest incidence of the disease in the neighbourhood of the hospital occurred on the windward side, and ample opportunities for infection in other ways were present. The space at our disposal hardly allows us to do justice to this very thorough little work, which will be found useful by practitioners who are anxious to get up recent facts regarding the results of vaccination, and by educated laymen who have doubts as to the efficacy of vaccination as a protection.

SOME POINTS IN REGARD TO THE GENESIS
OF MESOBLASTIC TUMOURS.

By J. P. Al'GOWAN, M.A., B.Sc., M.D. (From The Rowett Research Institute, Aberdeen.)

The experiments to be recorded here have reference to the effect of intraperitoneal inoculation of coal-tar into fowls. One ?bject in performing them was to test the effect of this substance
?n the bone marrow in relation to blood formation.

As described elsewhere,1 the peritoneal cavity in fowls is direct communication with the marrow of the medulla of the

bones. It was hoped thus to introduce the tar directly into the marrow as one had previously introduced powdered glass.1 The inflammation set up, however, by the tar closed the

stomata to the marrow and prevented this. In actual fact,

Wjth the exception of a slight anaemia in one case, cock 14, n? symptoms referable to the blood system were produced 111 any of the inoculated fowls. This aspect, therefore, except f?r a further passing reference, need not be further dealt with.

In a previous case already referred to, where sterile powdered glass had been injected intraperitoneal^ into a fowl,1 a large 'fiesoblastic tumour, the size of a Jaffa orange and attached by a fine pedicle to the duodenum, had developed. Another ?hject, therefore, in performing these experiments was to test the effect of such a carcinogenic agent as tar in this direction.
The coal-tars used were, in the first place a dehydrated

crude sample, produced from Scotch coal in vertical retorts Aberdeen Gas Works and, secondly, one which, in the hands
of Professor Archibald Leitch, had produced, by painting the

skin, carcinomata in mice. Both were diluted to a 10 per cent,
solution in Paraffinum Liquidum (B.P.) before injection. All of

the birds received inoculations with the first tar sample, some in addition were treated also with the second one. All received
multiple inoculations at weekly intervals. With the exception of the slight anaemia already referred to,
none of them, even after a long period and many injections, showed any symptoms that could be regarded as evidence of poisoning by the tar. It was thus possible to keep the birds
for observation for some considerable time.
Some details of the more important points in the experiment may now be given. It lasted from the beginning of September 1928 to the middle of January 1929. White leghorn cocks> aged six months at the beginning of the experiment, were employed. Eleven were inoculated, numbered consecutively from 10 to 20. To each of them, at the beginning, was administered intraperitoneally, by means of a syringe, from
2 to 4 c.c. of the 10 per cent, solution of Aberdeen tar in
liquid paraffin. This was repeated at weekly intervals. Meanwhile, on or about the 20th November, four of them, namely cocks 15, 18, 19 and 20, were killed by weasels. On the 23rd November and again on the 29th, those remaining, namely
cocks 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 17, received 2 c.c. of a 10 per
cent, solution of the London tar instead of the Aberdeen
material. After the last date, no further injections were given. The appearances present on the naked eye examination of
the various birds will now be described. Of the cocks killed
by weasels, only two were available for examination. The others had been entirely devoured by rats, the bones only being left. Cock 20 had been attacked but the gizzard and part of the intestine were still left undamaged in the abdominal cavity. They showed a uniformly greatly thickened peritoneum and a round, smooth nodule of the size of a pea and pure white in colour on the anterior surface of the gizzard. Cock 15 was intact. Its abdomen was filled with an oily brownish fluid; the peritoneal lining was uniformly thickened and there was
a solid exudate over the surface of the liver and gizzard,
rendering both adherent to the anterior abdominal wall. The other organs showed nothing abnormal.
Cock 17 was found dead on 2nd January 1929. The only
peritoneal lesions of importance in this case were some
exudate, a uniformly thickened peritoneal lining which was
also studded all over with rounded smooth nodules the size
of a pea, most of them white, some, however, slightly blackish.

Genesis of Mesoblastic Tumours

Between the 14th and iSth January, the remainder of the
birds, namely cocks 16, 13, 11, 10, 14 and 12, none of them

obviously out of condition, were killed.
Peritoneal effusion and uniform great

In all, there were thickening of the

Peritoneum. In cocks 13 and 16 there was in addition a

mass of tissue behind the gizzard, rendering this adherent

already the surrounding organs. This contained some black
Pigment. In cocks 10, 11, 12 and 14, further to the findings
described there occurred numerous tumours, attached
often by a thin pedicle to the peritoneum. They varied in Slze from that of a small pea to one of the size of a plum, which occurred in cock 10. They had a characteristic appear-

ance, being round, smooth and of a porcellanous whiteness.

forceps addition, the tumours had a very mucoid, slimy consistence,
evidenced in one direction by their eluding the grasp of the when an attempt was made to hold them for cutting
UP- These characteristics have often been observed in others

?f the less malignant type of Rous tumours, encountered as sPoradic occurrences.

It should be emphasised at this stage that, in several of these fowls, while the whole of the peritoneal surface was subjected to the same irritant, three different conditions were found present as a result, often in the same fowl. Thus there occurred a uniformly thickened peritoneum, thickened adhesions
between various organs and isolated tumours on free surfaces, ^he possible significance of this will be discussed later.
Cock 14 exhibited a special pathological finding in that it showed considerable development of cysts in the marrow of ^-he long bones. During the period 23rd October to 3rd
December it presented evidence of anaemia. Thei haemoglobin

however, Percentage, 45 per cent, at the beginning of the period, improved, to normal towards the end. The microscopic appearances of the various lesions present will now be described. This has reference in the main to the

c?nditions found in the peritoneal cavity, as this alone appeared
to be affected.

The earliest stage found present appeared to partake of the nature of a granuloma. There was a dense tissue matrix
forming a background. It consisted largely of a collection of
Polymorphonuclear leucocytes together with a very few stellate,
reticular cells. These latter were slender structures
branching, With branching arms and at this stage entirely without vacuoles.
647

J. P. M'Gowan
In the matrix just described were embedded numerous, multinucleated, very vacuolated giant cells. These were rounded in outline and enclosed in their centre a much larger single vacuole. At the same time there were present also numerous larger
spaces, enclosed by a thin sharply defined limiting membrane, which showed often a single flattened nucleus (Figs, i and 2).
The vacuoles were for the most part empty?a few exceptionally contained a little black pigment derived from the tar. Thus Fig. 3 shows carbon pigment inside some of the vacuoles.
The smaller collections of tar are inside multi-nucleated giant cells. Possibly all the vacuoles at one time may have contained
tar or oil. This may have disappeared spontaneously or by being dissolved out in the process of making sections. The origin of the larger spaces would seem to have been by distension and thinning from the multi-nucleated giant cells, which in turn appear to arise from the reticular stellate cells already described.
The next stage appears to be associated with the disappearance of the polymorphonuclear infiltration and of the multinucleated giant cells as such, and with the appearance of a large number of very vacuolated reticular cells forming a network (Figs. 4 and 5). Such cells are typical macrophages or freehistiocytes. The tissue has a sponge-like appearance from their presence and from the persistence of the larger vacuoles previously described.
Groups of histioblasts or resting-wandering cells are also present on occasion at this stage (Fig. 6). They are characterised by angular outline, unstained nucleus, and deeply basophil cytoplasm. From these are derived many of the macrophages or free histiocytes already referred to.
In the next stage the tissue evolves in one of two directions.
Thus it may become ordinary connective or scar-tissue (Fig. l)This especially occurs in regions of adhesion.
On the other hand, on the free surfaces of organs it may develop into rounded tumours. Histologically, these are of the nature of fibromata and are without the vacuolisation or other
appearances already described (Figs. 8, 9, 10). The occurrence of these fibromata on free surfaces and on surfaces subject to friction and slip may be emphasised in passing.
The appearances of a tumour produced by the intraperitoneal injection of powdered glass into a fowl may now be described for comparison. Fig. 11 shows a section of par^ of this tumour which, it will be seen, contains vacuoles and
648

Genesis of Mesoblastic Tumours

vacuolated giant cells and corresponds to the vacuolated tar tumour described above. Fig. 12, on the other hand, shows a
Portion practically entirely fibromatous, while Fig. 13 from the same tumour shows a network of macrophages, corresponding to that seen in the tar condition. Thus the powdered glass has Produced the same effects as the tar.

For comparison, two illustrations from sporadically occurring fibromata in fowls are submitted. . Fig. 14 is from a section of a spontaneous tumour in the leg of a fowl (hen 140) which, naked eye in its whiteness, smoothness, non-infiltrating character and its mucoid slimy consistency, resembled the tumours in the tar fowls above. In this case there was a

secondary growth in the heart and the tumour was transplanted
for one generation but was lost in the second.

Fig- 15 is from a section of a tumour on the under-surface of the wing of a fowl (hen 35) caused by a weasel-bite. This tumour
had extensive secondary growths in the thorax and abdomen.

Without an extensive discussion of the matter, it would

Seem possible to draw the conclusion from the cases described that in the tar cases we are dealing with the occurrence of a granuloma which, in part, has developed into ordinary

connective or scar tissue and in part into a definite tumour,
a fibroma. The appearance of the tumour refers of course to lts initiation only : once initiated it progresses, tumour tissue

giving rise to tumour tissue without having to pass through
a granulomatous stage.

Such a happening would seem to have a bearing on a

c?mmonplace in the discussion of such conditions, namely
the question as to whether such lesions are granulomata or tumours. Both views are held. The truth would seem to ke that, in many cases, the granuloma may be a stage towards
the development of a fibroid mesoblastic tumour and that, in
certain tumours, there may be found a mixture of the two

c?nditions persisting together. A possible deduction from the occurrences described in
the tar fowl is, having regard to the granulomatous condition aud its dual fate, that tumour formation in the mesoblastic tissues is repair gone wrong. This would seem to be warranted inasmuch as in the peritoneal cavity of the same fowl subjected t? the same conditions part of the granulomatous tissue has become normal scar tissue while another part has become a

fibromatous tumour.

J. P. M'Gowan
While the full reason for this differential development may not be to hand, its occurrence should be emphasised. There is a possible hint as to causation in the fact observed, namely that, while adhesion tissue became eventually normal scar tissue, tissue on a free surface, although capable of forming scar tissue as in the thickened peritoneum, tended in places to develop towards fibroma formation. In the latter case there would be an absence of tension phenomena between the two
adhering surfaces during the process of maturation of the tissue. In addition there would be the presence of an unwonted factor, namely, that of " slip " between the opposing surfaces of the peritoneum. It is possible that as connective tissue is developed to sustain tension, the absence of this tension, due to these two factors, during its development might give the tissue a push in the wrong direction.
This last consideration raises the general question of the possible determining cause of tumour formation. The majority regard it as due to some form of irritation : a minority, however, look on it as due to specific cancer producing substances, as apart from irritation. They argue that in those cases where there is gross naked eye injury done to a tissue by an irritant, tumour formation rarely occurs: and that carcinogenic substances may produce cancer without much evidence of " irritation." Such a statement of the case limits the possible results of irritation to something gross and palpable. Naturally the phenomena of inflammation, an affair in the main of the connective tissues, and which appears to be taken as an index of
the amount of irritation, would be much less in the case of an irritant affecting an intact epithelial surface than in the case where the epithelial surface had been broken through and a bacterial invasion had taken place.
Ewing2 would seem to state the case fairly where he remarks that nearly every variety of influence capable of disturbing the nutrition and equilibrium of the cell has been connected with the origin of some form of cancer. It would
seem therefore to be unnecessary to substitute a multitude of
different specific cancer producing bodies for the finer gradations
of cell irritation, that is those having to do with the interfering with the normal life of, and with what one might call, a constant " nagging" at the cell. All tumour producing substances would appear to have this in common that in order to produce then* effect they must all pass through the gateway of irritation.
65?

Genesis of Mesoblastic Tumours
As the subject has been discussed elsewhere3 very little need be said at this stage regarding the nature of the supposed ultimate cause of tumour formation, except to state that there is no evidence for this being of the nature of a living multiplying virus. Apart from evidence discussed elsewhere and not germane to the present issue, in the instances dealt with here, tumours have been produced by such things as tar and Powdered glass, where the presence of such a virus should not c?me into question. The occurrence of a tumour following ?n a weasel bite only serves to emphasise the present point of Vlew. The inflammation occurring here, due to the organisms Present, whatever these were, produced a non-specific irritation and interference with the development of normal repair, which ln its turn led to the production of the tumour.
So far one has been discussing the question of tumour Production as contrasted with the phenomena of normal repair, hi parenthesis it may be said that, in this communication, one
ls dealing solely with mesoblastic tumours of a fibromatous type as they occur in the fowl. The question arises whether such tumours are all of the same nature differing possibly
?nly in degree. Examination of a considerable number of them, of the
sPontaneously occurring and experimentally produced types, leads one to conclude that they can be regarded in this light. The ^etiological evidence, such as it is, leads one to this conclusion. Histological examination shows that, although they may vary considerably in architecture, even in different areas of the same tumour, parts being very dense while others are of more open texture, they are all modifications of connective tissue, using this word in its broadest sense, the more common varieties conforming readily to the category of fibromata.
Such a statement refers equally to simple and malignant humours. The question now arises how these two types are to
be distinguished. Histologically the more cellular a tumour is and the more embryonic in type the cells are, the moie likely
it is to be malignant and conversely. The main distinction,
however, between the two groups is a biological one. Malignant
tumours grow much more rapidly, invading other tissues meanwhile, and are liable to produce secondary growths in the animal's own body or by transference in the bodies of animals ?f the same species.
651

J. P. McGowan
The greater rapidity of growth and invasive power is merely an indication of the cellularity, etc., and need not be
further discussed. The power of producing secondary growths
requires, however, further elaboration. The cells involved in these tumours are of the monocytic
or macrophagic and the fibroblastic lineage of the reticuloendothelial system. This has been shown in addition to other evidence quite definitely by the work of Carrel, Fischer, Haagen, etc., on tissue cultures from such tumours.3' 4 The microscopical appearances in the tar and glass tumours in the above fowls lends support to this view, inasmuch as the two main types of cell active there, as already shown, are the macrophages and the fibroblasts.
In parenthesis, a word may be said regarding the great importance of the reticulo-endothelial system in connection with the subject under discussion. The authority on this
matter is Maximow. A glance at the diagram in his paper,5
p. 588, will show how the many types of macrophagic cells all
end up by becoming fibroblasts. The phenomena of repair
can be written practically in terms of these two types of cellThis subject is discussed more fully elsewhere.3
Carrel, Fischer, Haagen, and others have shown by tissue
cultures from such mesoblastic tumours as the Rous tumour,
arsenic and indol tumours that the agent, by which the tumour can be transferred to other fowls, exists and multiplies in the macrophage but that it is absent from the fibroblast. In later work, however, Carrel,0 dealing with rat sarcoma No. 10 of the Crocker foundation and with the Jensen rat sarcoma, has shown, also by tissue culture, that the fibroblast is capable, as well as the macrophage, of carrying and producing the infecting agent.
It appears, therefore, that the cells involved in these fibroid mesoblastic tumours, the macrophage and the fibroblast, may produce and carry a substance which enables them on inoculation to reproduce the tumour. This substance in fowl tumours can be separated from the cells which contain it by filtration through porcelain filters and, thus purified, is able still to reproduce the disease on injection.
Various views have been held and are still held regarding
the natufe of this agent. Some, like Gye, regard it as an absolutely necessary adjuvant to a non-specific living cancer virus. The majority, however, now regard it as a chemical

substance, capable in itself alone of instigating tumour formation. Different ideas, however, exist with regard to the nature
ar>d mode of action of this chemical substance. This matter is

discussed elsewhere3 and a short summary, of the conclusions
arrived at, alone is necessary here.
belonging As already mentioned, these tumours are to be regarded as
to the monocytic or macrophagic lineage of the reticulo-endothelial system. Evidence was adduced from a c?nsideration of leukaemic and other tumour conditions in the

This chemical substance, which was designated a "stimulin," Was conceived as having the power, on its being absorbed and
distributed by the blood, of stimulating embryonic non-
developed They cells of the reticulo-endothelial system throughout
the body to develop along the lines of the originating cells. In
tins way an attempt was made to explain the secondary ?rowths of the malignant tumours of this type in various regions in a single animal's body. They are regarded as growths within a system, the reticulo-endothelial system.
are not true metastases for these arise from cells set

lymph, etc., to different parts of the body, where they
Proliferate and form new growths. It is a commonplace with regard to such tumours that.
lri the beginning, they can be transferred by implantation to blood relations only of the host, but that after several such transferences they can be successfully transferred to members
the same race other than blood relations, and thereafter
t? members of other races or to the species in general. They Cannot, however, be transferred beyond this to animals of a different species.
These occurrences have relation to the important question the " specificity" of such tumours and the following deductions ^yere drawn from them. Such a progression was regarded as ?ne from the reticulo-endothelial system of the single fowl
through that of blood relations to that of the race and
species. Concurrently with this the "stimulin," which at first c?uld only affect the reticulo-endothelial system of the host

of the tumour was supposed to become gradually able, by "acclimatisation," to provoke tumour growth in the reticuloendothelial system of the species.
The modus operandi of the spread of the tumour in the individual case, of the "specificity" of the tumour in the early transferences, and the subsequent partial breakdown of this "specificity would appear to have been satisfactorily accounted for thus.
These remarks have reference only to the types of tumour
dealt with (here. There seems to be no reason whatever
why the same views should not hold with regard to all true
sarcomata, in which case their metastases would have to be
regarded from an angle different from the usual one. As has been said, the word " stimulin " was used to designate
the chemical substance obtained from tumours with the qualities
just delineated. This word, however, is used with other significations and it seems expedient to use a term with a meaning more or less restricted to the sense required here. The word ." Cledone" might be appropriate. Originally, aS k\ijScov* it implied a message sent from Zeus which caused certain of the inhabitants of the world to comport themselves according to a certain fashion. By liberal substitution it
produced might be made to imply here a chemical substance
by a set of master-cells at one part of a system and sent out by
them into the circulation, and which would cause undeveloped
cells of this system at distant parts of it to comport themselves like the originating cells.
The literature appropriate to the present subject may be dealt with quite briefly. There has been a considerable amount on the question of the production of sarcomata in fowls by
means of injection of extract of fowl embryo in conjunction
with such substances as arsenic, indol, tar, etc. These are beside the point here and need not be further discussed.
The production of sarcomata by the injection of tar is discussed by Woglom in his monographic article.7 He refers there to the production of a fibromyxoma by Yamagivva> Suzuki and Murayama and by Yamagiwa and Murayama by the injection of tar and hydrous wool fat into the breast of a female rabbit. Lacassagne and Monod are mentioned as having
produced a sarcoma in the testicle of a rabbit by injection of tar. Russell similarly is recorded as having produced a

Genesis of Mesoblastic Tumours
spindle-celled sarcoma in mice by subcutaneous inoculation ?f tar. At page 711 ct seq the question of sarcoma production by the painting of tar on the surface of the skin is discussed. The difficulty of distinguishing such sarcomata from spindlecelled carcinomata produced under similar circumstances and So establishing their separate existence is stressed.
The subject is also discussed by Levvin in his Monograph
?n Tumours.8 He mentions that cases of formation of
Many Sarcomata after the exhibition of tar have rarely been recorded. of the cases so chronicled have occurred in association
with carcinoma. The question is thus complicated, as has already ^en indicated, by a difficulty in determining whether many of ^e so-called sarcomata thus encountered are not in reality Carcinomata with fusiform cell formation by the epithelium.
From the discussion by these two authorities it would Seem that the cases of sarcoma production following tar
administration, especially tar inoculation, recorded in the literature are few in number.
From a survey of subsequent literature one has not been able to find much in the way of additional cases. Lowenthal9 injected mice intraperitoneally with tar dissolved in oil and found in three out of forty-two the production of a sarcoma at the pylorus and root of the mesentery. Melzer10 claims to have produced an alveolar sarcoma in rats by the inunction ?ftar. Choldin (quoted by Lewin) succeeded in producing in a hen by subcutaneous injection of an oil solution of tar, a true Sarcoma which was transplantable.
The relation of inflammation and granulation tissue to the Production of cancer is discussed by Ewing (loc. cit., p. 5)refers to the fact that often inflammatory growth passes by ^sensible gradations into neoplastic proliferation. He states ^at the conclusions of the older clinicians are justified in that Cancer rarely arises on a previously normal tissue but only *n tissues altered by chronic inflammation. He regaids the Neoplastic process as the correlative of the inflammatory one and believes that the latter may pass by insensible giadations into the former.
Lewin {loc. cit., p. 24) also discusses this aspect of the subject.
He refers to the work of Podwyssotzki and others on the Production of granulomata and subsequently tumours by t e ejection intraperitoneally into guinea-pigs, rabbits, dogs, etc.

tumours and concludes without sufficient reason, however, it would seem in some cases, that transitions from such
granulomata to true tumour conditions occur. The reaction of the tissues to an irritant with the production
at first of a granuloma seems also to be the basis of the production of tumours in association with such macroscopic parasites as Tcznia crassicollis, etc., and such microscopic
infections as Bacillus tuberculosis and those causing syphilis*
Hodgkin's disease, etc. This subject is discussed by Ewing (loc. cit., p. 4) and Lewin (loc. cit., pp. 84 and 88).
Summary and. Conclusions.?Where coal-tar was injected
intraperitoneally into fowls, granulation tissue or a granuloma
was at first formed. Thereafter scar tissue was formed in some
places while in others definite fibromata appeared. A possible
reason for this differential development is suggested, while the
fact of its actual occurrence is stressed as significant in regard
to tumour formation.
It is emphasised that fibroid mesoblastic tumours appear to be of the nature of perverted repair processes.
The tumours here produced are compared with other like tumours. The general aetiology is discussed and a view previously stated is reaffirmed, namely, that such mesoblastic tumours (and possibly the majority of true sarcomata) are tumours within a system, the reticulo-endothelial system. Metastases in such cases are not regarded as true metastases.
The part played by the " stimulin " is rediscussed, and for reasons given a new designation, " Cledone," is suggested for this principle.
I am indebted to Professor Archibald Leitch for a sample of carcinogenic tar; to Mr James Ironside for preparing the photographs; and to the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland for a grant towards their reproduction.

\ Mbt. Ill? Cast's of Intermittent Fever in which bleeding
V was employed in the Cold Stage, with Pathological Obser-
\i vations. By John Mackintosh, M. D., F. It. College of Surgeons, Acting Surgeon to tile Ordnance in North Britain, Physician to the General Dispensary Brown's Square, and Lecturer on the Practice of Physic, &c. in Edinburgh.
The progress of medicine has been greatly ,retarded by the
conduct of those "who have attempted to explain too much. Instead of seizing on the principal phenomena of a disease, and following these, they have employed all their talents in endeavouring to discover the occult causes. In intermittent fever they have exerted all their ingenuity in tracing the cause of the rigors, while they have thrown no light whatever upon the
nature and seat of the disease.
It is not the exact object of this paper to attempt any refutation of the doctrine of Cullen, respecting " debility, diminished energy of the brain, and spasm of the extreme vessels," as the proximate cause of the cold stage; or that of Mason Good, who appears to attribute it to " debility and a diminished supply of sensorial fluid." It appears to me that the crude mechanical notion of Hippocrates stands upon quite as good a foundation. He thought that a quantity of air got into the vessels of the surface of the body, and drove the blood before it to the centre, and thus produced the cold stage.
Before we shall be entitled to receive the doctrines either of 'Cullen or Good into the medical evidence of the case, we must
t)e more intimately acquainted, not only with the ahatomy and physiology of the brain and nervous system, and with the structure of the extreme capillary branches, but also with the great principle of life itself,?upon all which points we are as yet unfortunately profoundly ignorant.

Dr Mackintosh's cases of Intermittent Fever.

261

I shall now proceed to give a sketch of the symptoms in the first stage of intermittents, as they generally appear, and then shortly offer my opinion, respecting the pathological condition of the body on which these symptoms depend.
For some little time before the paroxysm begins, the patient complains of lassitude and debility, (but which is not actual weakness, but oppression,) with diminished circulation on the surface of the body, more particularly in the extremities; they are benumbed and feel cold; the sense of cold becomes universal, and a shivering takes place. The body soon becomes affected with universal tremors. There is great prostration of strength, confusion of mind, sometimes delirium, anxious and quick breathing, the patient being unable to take in a deep inspiration, and oppression at the praecordia; and the pulse, which is sometimes quick, at others slow, is often irregular, but always oppressed.
It is rare, avowedly, that complete coma, apoplexy, or convulsions take place; but that these do occur, the records of medicine fully prove; and I have seen more than one person
die in the cold stage. The convulsive tremors are pot under the control of the will, and if I can trust my own sensations,
they affect internal as well as external muscles. I attribute all these symptoms to congestion in internal or-
gans. I imagine no one who has seen this disease will deny
that there is sufficient evidence of the balance of the circulation

being upset, and that an irregular determination of blood takes place. It appears to have quitted the surface, by the coldness and shrinking of the extremities. It is forced upon internal organs to a serious extent, impeding their functions.
Thus the convulsive tremors, confusion of mind, and pain in the head, are produced by congestion of the brain and spinal

marrow.

.

The difficulty of breathing is owing principally to venoms engorgement of the lungs, and the overloaded state of the right side of the heart. The spleen, liver, and mesenteric vessels, also suffer from congestion, and frequent attacks lead to structural derangements of these viscera. These pathological conclusions are fully established, by comparing the symptoms with the morbid
appearances found in the examination of the bodies of those
who have expired in the cold stages, and are corroborated in a remarkable manner, by the good effects of opening a vein, when all the symptoms give way in an instant. I have seen
men in the most severe sufferings, relieved after the abstraction
of 6, 8, and 10 ounces of blood. I have known 3 ounces, suffice, and on one or two occasions only I had to bleed to |the extent of two pounds. The relief, which is the mo^ perfect relief that can well be conceived, is so sudden, when a good

orifice can be made, that it has surprised and delighted every one who has seen my practice. I shall never forget the pleasure "which was expressed by my excellent friend Dr Kellie, who is well known to the professional world, when he first saw the practice carried into execution in my hospital. Before proceeding further, I may shortly mention the appearances which I have seen on opening the bodies of a few men who expired in the cold stage.
An immense quantity of black blood was found in the vessels of the head, the lungs, the heart, and large vessels near it, the liver, spleen, and mesenteric vessels. The spleen, (according to Sir John Pringle, and some of the older writers,) has sometimes been found ruptured from over-distension. So great a quantity of blood have I seen in such cases in the lungs, that large sections of them sank in water. These portions, when washed and deprived of blood by pressure, regained their natural appearance and buoyancy. The liver, when washed and squeezed, will also regain its natural colour.
This pathological condition of organs has been denominated " congestion.1' It simply implies, that the balance between the arterial and venous systems is lost for the time, the latter being overloaded or congested, and not that the circulation in any organ, or set of organs, is entirely obstructed. This indeed does happen in those extreme cases, in which reaction does not take place, and the individuals die in the cold stage.
From the time of Celsus, an idea has prevailed that death would be the inevitable consequence of bleeding in the cold stage. The late Dr Gregory used to make this assertion in his lectures, and, to give it more weight, he quoted the expression of Celsus, " hominem jugulare." Other lecturers on the practice of physic make similar statements. It would be curious and interesting to know, whether they have ever seen this melancholy consequence of bleeding in the cold stage; or whether they have been led to suppose it would be produced, assuming, as Cullen did, that the paroxysm is produced by debility, want of energy of the brain, and spasm of the mouths
of the extreme vessels.
After numerous observations, made with the utmost anxiety to discover truth, and from the sensations I experienced during a protracted intermittent in a marshy country, I submitted myself to the experiment, in the first instance, disregarding altogether the force of authority upon this subject. Bark and all the usual remedies had failed, and my health was materially injured. A vein was opened in the arm, and before 12 ounces were abstracted, the rigors ceased, and all its unpleasant accompaniments ; there was no hot stage, no sweating stage; a plea-

sant sense of heat succeeded the painful one of cold, and instead of weakness, I was sensible of an acquisition of strength. Afterwards I bled many other individuals, and always with the same results. This was done so long ago as the year 1810 ; but as I cannot appeal, at this distance of time, to living witnesses, I shall
confine the statement I am now to make to the cases of inter -
mittents which have occurred to me within these few years, and
which have been seen by many witnesses who were well qualified to judge, from their experience, and standing in the profession, and also by many of my pupils.

Case I?James Ward?admitted into Royal Ordnance Hospital
in November 1823.
Has suffered several attacks of intermittent annually, since the year 1809, when he served in the expedition to Walcheren. Of late his indispositions were long, and left him more and more debilitated. Several of my pupils watched this man closely every third day, for a number of attacks, with a view to bleed him in the cold stage, but they were not fortunate enough to arrive in time ; they bled him twice, however, in the hot fit, from the severity of
the symptoms, and with considerable temporary relief, but without
preventing or mitigating the violence of the subsequent paroxysms. Some time afterwards, in the presence of Drs Lucas and Robinson, two of my pupils, I bled him from a vein in the arm, during the cold stage; it was very severe; the rigors were violent, and the sense of coldness insupportable. He complained much of his head and loins, his face was of a livid colour, and the vessels of the conjunctiva turgid with blood. Pulse 100 or 105, and oppressed, breathing short and anxious, and, to use his own expression, he felt " a heavy load about his heart." When the vein was opened, the blood trickled slowly from the wound, but it soon came in a jet. By the time 8 ounces were taken, the rigors ceased, and he expressed great surprise at the suddenness of the relief; when 12 ounces were abstracted, he was free from all complaint, and his skin had a comfortable moist feel. He enjoyed a good night; he had no return of the intermittent; and his recovery was rapid.
I had an opportunity of seeing this man daily for some months afterwards, and his constant tale was, that he had not felt so well, or so much of a man since he went to Walclieren. The only remedies he took after the bleeding, were laxatives and infusion of
quassia. Case II James Atkinson, aged 33, had had repeated attacks of
ague. Was seized with severe rigors when on the top of the Carlisle mail, travelling to Edinburgh. The paroxysm was evidently produced by exposure in bad weather, first to rain, and then to a keen frost, with wet clothes. When I visited him in hospital, he had laboured under the rigors for no less a period than twenty-six hours,? in truth, it was the most severe cold stage I had ever seen in any country. He had severe pain in the head, back, and loins ; oppress

sion at praecordia. Warm drinks and stimulants, and hot applications had been employed without benefit. The agitation of his body was so great, that it shook the very bedstead on which he lay, and threatened to terminate in convulsions. Tongue loaded, but moist; breathing hurried and laborious ; pulse 65, oppressed ] skin not below the natural standard over the trunk, but all his extremities were cold, and he complained of a sensation of extreme cold. Fortunately, I made a good orifice, which is not always easily done from
the tremors, and the blood floAved in a better stream than I had ever
seen it in the cold stage ; 12 ounces were abstracted in three mi-
nutes, with very trifling relief, except to his breathing; but during the flow of the second pound, he became more and more easy, and the rigor ceased completely. This pound was abstracted in two minutes ; the arm was tied up on the approach of syncope, from which, however, he soon recovered. He lay quite easy; his body, and even the extremities, became of a proper temperature; and his skin felt moist; his pulse rose from 65 to 106 ; lie passed a good night; had several stools during the next twenty-four hours; was found perfectly easy next day. On the following day he was convalescent, looked well, and asked for more food, and had no return of the dis-
ease.

half an hour and was well formed, his pulse beating 84 and oppressed, a vein was opened in the arm by Mr Marshall, (one of my most zealous pupils, now assistant-surgeon of the 87th Regiment,) in the presence of several other gentlemen. When 15 ounces of blood were abstracted the rigor ceased; the pain of head and loins, and the oppression at prajcordia vanished; the breathing became natural; the pulse rose to 95 ; in half ah hour after the operation, said he felt quite well; there was no hot fit; a very gentle moisture was on the surface, but there was no sweating stage ; pulse 95.

visits; He is now in a severe well-formed cold fit; breathing hur-

The same individual reported himself sick on 30th May following, and was taken into hospital, after a severe paroxysm of intermittent ; states that, since his discharge, his health had been very good and his strength increasing, and that he has had three slight rigors ; his appearance is much improved. 31st.?Says he expects the paroxysm to-morrow morning at nine o'clock; bowels regular; appetite good. He was ordered to take three grains of sulphate of quinine every half-hour, commencing three hours before the expected time

till the 13th day, with little variation. He was then seized with a

severe rigor, attended by sensations more than usually distressing ;

above all he complained acutely of his head. He was bled during the

gor was very severe ; the tremors of his body shook the bed, and his

sense of cold was unsupportable, at the time that a thermometer

placed under the tongue stood at 100. He complained of great op-

pression ; pain of back and loins ; respiration difficult and hurried.

The rigor was allowed to be formed for 10 or 12 minutes before a

vein was opened, which was effected with difficulty, owing to the tremors. He bled from a small orifice until 24 ounces were drawn, which occupied 16 minutes, when the rigor ceased, and all its un-

pleasant symptoms.

which he had no return of the disease."

Case VI.?Alexander Clark, a stout well-made young man, with
a florid complexion. Had three attacks of tertian intermittent before he reported him-
self sick; came into hospital on 21st May 1826 with the fourth paroxysm upon him. He was attacked at 7 a. m. with rigors, and the fit was very severe. The hot stage had given way to the sweating when I saw him. He could assign no cause except that he had done duty at Woolwich a few months before. Tongue foul; fever
diet.

well formed, a vein was opened, but the operation was badly performed owing to the violent tremors j 20 ounces of blood were

slowly drawn, when the rigor ceased, together with the tremors,

the difficulty of breathing, the oppression at prsccordia, and the

headach, &c. The painful sense of cold gave way all at once to a

pleasant feeling of heat, and the pulse became natural. The bleed-

ing was not carried the length of producing syncope. There was

no hot stage, and the skin was covered with a gentle moisture. In

half an hour his only complaint was of slight nausea ; he is able to

change his position at pleasure, and feols disposed to sleep.

29th Had considerable heat of skin and thirst yesterday even-

ing, which he attributed to the pressure of too many bed-clothes ;

the blankets not having been removed which he had caused to be

heaped upon himself on the approach of the cold stage. Slept well

during the night; feels quite easy ; no stool.

His general health and appearance improved especially after this

period, but he continued to experience daily slight attacks till the

7th June, when he got, thrice a-day, five grain doses of the quinine.

June 8th.?Took the quinine at eleven, at one, and three

o'clock, nevertheless, he had a paroxysm at a quarter past three,

which he is disposed to attribute to exposure when asleep between

two open windows; high excitement followed the rigor, which ter-

minated in the sweating stage.

He continued to take the quinine on the 9tli and 10th, and

had no return of the disease. He regained his health and strength

rapidly, and was discharged on the 17th June.

Dr Kellie of Leith was present when Clark and Macauley were

bled ; so were several gentlemen who were attending my lectures

at the time.

Case VII Mr Marshall, assistant-surgeon ofthe 87th Regiment,
whose name I have had occasion to mention before, when on a visit to

his friends in the west of Scotland, was called to see a middle-aged man who had served in the army in a warm climate, and who had

suffered most severely for some years from intermittent fever. Every kind of remedy had been tried in vain, and he gladly submitted to the treatment of bleeding in the cold stage, which Mr Marshall had seen so successfully performed in similar cases. " On the Gth July 1826," says Mr Marshall, " I was asked to visit this man for the first time. Previous to my going, I informed Mr StaffSurgeon Marshall (senior) of the nature of the case, in as far as I was enabled from the history given by his relations. Mr M. recommended a grain of opium to be given every hour for three hours previous to the attack. The shivering commenced regularly about six in the evening. The opium was given at 3, 4, and 5 o'ciock, p. ai. with no relief. 8tli?Opium continued as directed; no relief; bowels opened by rhubarb. 10th?No relief from the opium. 12th?The cold fit is very severe ; the feet cold; heat of the superior extremities rather above the natural standard and moist; pulse very small, not easily perceived ; pain of head excessive; great thirst; pain in back considerable ; complains of distressing sense of weight at the pnecordia. He solicited me to do something for him, as he could not long endure the sense of cold. I opened a vein in the arm by a pretty large orifice. At first the blood trickled down the arm, but shortly came in a full stream. When 10 ounces of blood had flowed the shivering
ceased, and all the bad symptoms vanished. Half an hour after the

bleeding, says he is quite well. On the 14th, 15th, 18th, no return of fever." He declared he felt quite well; and Mr Marshall assured me that he had had no return ofthe complaint when he last visited him, which was several months after the bleeding. Indeed Mr Marshall mentioned to me that the cure seemed to be as sudden, and apparently as permanent, as that which took place in Ward's case, the first recorded in this paper.

Dr Mackintosh's cases of'Intermittent Fever.

Case VIII?A. B. aged 36, a native of Eyemouth, was seized with an intermittent of the quartan type when in Lincolnshire in August last. He had used various remedies, and among-the rest hark, without relief. The paroxysms have continued with such regularity, that he has not escaped a single attack since the commencement of the disease. His health and strength
have suffered so much, that he has been unable to work for a con-
siderable time, and he came to Edinburgh, almost in despair, to seek relief. Having applied to my friend Dr J. A. Robertson, this patient was handed over to me. His look is meagre and emaciated;
he appears the wreck of a strong and active man. He gave the above account of himself, and added, that he has great thirst and
no appetite, that he sleeps badly, and never free from pain in the back part of the head and left liypochondrium, and that he has become as weak as a child ; and that his vision has lately become impaired. Pulse 100, and weak ; tongue clean ; B. regular.
On Thursday, 28th December 1826, at 2 p. m. the rigor commenced., and when it had continued for half an hour, I opened a vein in the arm, having placed him in the sitting posture; his whole body was affected by violent tremors, his teeth chattered; he complained of intense cold; dimness of sight; severe pain in the back part of the head, and in the left side, loins, and inferior extremities ; his pulse was weak and fluttering, so as not to be counted, and the countenance expressed great suffering. Owing to the vio-
lence of the tremors, a bad orifice was made in the vein, and the
blood flowed slowly. When about twelve ounces were abstracted, the rigors diminished, the uneasy feelings began to subside ; and by
the time 16 ounces were taken, he was free from tremor and
pain, and said he felt quite well. The pulse was now a good pulse, but I neglected to make a memorandum of its number at the time. He showed some tendency to syncope before his arm was tied up.
My friends Drs Robertson and Scott, and Mr Syme, together with several other gentlemen, were present when the operation was performed. He was visited in an hour, when he was found breathing naturally, in a sweet sleep. Pulse 84, and of good strength. I was told he had been very faint, and had vomited immediately after we left the house. >r!
In an hour after last visit I saw him again ; his body had the natural heat; there was no perspiration; he was still asleep; pulse 80, and full. He was roused after the pulse was numbered, for the purpose of ascertaining the exact nature of his feelings. He said he had not felt so free from indisposition since the first period of the attack, and that he had been long a stranger to such a comfortable refreshing sleep ; he took some gruel, soon fell asleep again, and passed an excellent night.

Sunday 31st.?He came to the dispensary again, and was seized
with the paroxysm a little after the hour of visit. The fit was pre-
ceded and accompanied by much slighter pains and general dis-
turbance than any former attack. In about ten minutes after the
fit could be said to be well formed, the rigors were very severe, and the tremors violent, and the feeling of debility was so overpowering that he declared he could sit up on a chair no longer ; his breathing was quick and laborious, and his teeth chattered; I tied up his arm and opened a vein, and actually before three oilhces] were abstracted, the paroxysm ceased, and with it all the other unpleasant symptoms. Although a minute before he had declared that he could not sit up a moment longer from debility, yet he now said he felt his strength restored, and he had no wish to lie down, and in less than ten minutes, I had the pleasure of seeing him running home. There was no subsequent heat of skin, and no sweating; his pulse, before he left the dispensary, was 86, and of good strength, whereas, before the bleeding, it was 100, and so weak as scarcely
to be counted.

Monday, 1st January?I sent to inquire how my patient felt ; the messenger was told that he had had a good night, and was out making merry with some friends.
On Wednesday he had a slight chill without subsequent fever or sweating; he afterwards got the sulphate of quinine, and had
no more of the disease.

From the facts already detailed, I think I may safely draw

the following conclusions, which, if correct, will hereafter be

found of great practical utility.

1. I need scarcely say that bleeding in the cold stage will not

necessarily produce death.

2. That this practice will sometimes cure the disease; at

others it will prove beneficial by breaking the chain of diseased

action, and rendering the subsequent paroxysms milder and

milder.

>h

3. That bleeding in the cold stage, in every case in which it has been yet tried, has cut short the cold fits, and has prevented the subsequent stages of the paroxysm, so that the hot and sweating stages are saved. It seems to operate by anticipating the natural efforts of the constitution, removing the internal congestion, and restoring the lost balance of the circulating system.
4. That itf'promises to be most serviceable in severe autumnal intermittents ; and more particularly in the pernicious and malignant fevers, as they are termed, of Italy, Holland, and other marshy countries, which are well known to be very fatal under the ordinary treatment. In these cases the reaction of the system cannot fully develope itself, in consequence of the

272

extent to which internal congestion has taken place, and which this practice will remove.
5. That it may be used with safety in any climate where the cold stage continues long and threatens danger.
6. That bleeding in the cold stage is, at all events, more successful than in the hot stage, or than in the intervals. For although I have often seen bleeding used in such circumstances, and with advantage, by mitigating unpleasant symptoms, yet I have never known the subsequent paroxysm prevented by it.
7. The practice may be adopted in the first stage of all fevers ; and probably will be found useful by surgeons in con-
cussion of the brain.
8. If these cases possessed no practical merit whatever, they promise to be productive of great advantage to medical science, by destroying the very foundation of the erroneous system of Cullen. The doctrines upon which this system is founded have, to this day, bewildered old and young in the profession, who think and act only under the nod of authority. Cullen's system has been a great bar to all improvement in medicine ; and is the principal cause of the backward state of pathology in this country, when compared with the strides made in that department by our professional brethren in France.
It was my intention to have extended my observations upon
this subject, particularly with a view to explain away the objections which will naturally suggest themselves to the minds of those who have been reared in Cullenian schools, and who still continue to be the staunch apostles of its doctrines. But as this paper has already extended itself beyond the limits originally intended, I must postpone such remarks for a subse-
quent number of this Journal.
It only occurs to me to mention, that it will afford me.much pleasure to receive communications from any of my professional brethren upon this subject, particularly from those who are situated in aguish districts.

Abstract
According to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, EFSA has reviewed the maximum residue levels (MRLs) currently established at European level for the pesticide active substance triflumizole. To assess the occurrence of triflumizole residues in plants, processed commodities, rotational crops and livestock, EFSA considered the conclusions derived in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC, the MRLs established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission as well as the import tolerances and European authorisations reported by Member States (including the supporting residues data). Based on the assessment of the available data, MRL proposals were derived and a consumer risk assessment was carried out. Although no apparent risk to consumers was identified, some information required by the regulatory framework was missing. Hence, the consumer risk assessment is considered indicative only and all MRL proposals derived by EFSA still require further consideration by risk managers.  2017 European Food Safety Authority.

Review of the existing MRLs for triflumizole
Summary
Triflumizole was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 July 2010 by Commission Directive 2010/27/EC, and has been deemed to be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/2011. As the active substance was approved after the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 on 2 September 2008, EFSA is required to provide a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing MRLs for that active substance in compliance with Article 12(1) of the aforementioned regulation. To collect the relevant pesticide residues data, EFSA asked the Netherlands, the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS), to complete the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile) and to prepare a supporting evaluation report. The PROFile and evaluation report provided by the RMS were made available to the Member States. A request for additional information was addressed to the Member States in the framework of a completeness check period, which was initiated by EFSA on 13 July 2016 and finalised on 13 September 2016. After having considered all the information provided, EFSA prepared a completeness check report which was made available to Member States on 17 November 2016.
EFSA prepared in January 2017 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States for consultation via a written procedure based on the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC, the MRLs established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission and the additional information provided by the RMS and Member States. Comments received by 16 February 2017 were considered during the finalisation of this reasoned opinion. The following conclusions are derived.
During the peer review, the metabolism of triflumizole following foliar application on grape and cucumber was relied upon. Similar residue profiles were obtained from both metabolism studies, where the parent was the main compound (80-87% total radioactive residue (TRR)) and the metabolite FM6-1 increased slowly up to 11% TRR following treatment. Additional metabolites were identified however remained below 10% of the TRR.
Triflumizole is authorised on crops that can be grown in rotation. However, according to Commission Directive 2010/27/EC, only uses as fungicide in greenhouses on artificial substrates may be authorised. Succeeding crop studies are not provided and are not considered necessary because the current use of triflumizole is for substrate culture only.
Studies investigating the effect of processing on the nature and magnitude of the residue are not available. Bearing in mind that for the considered crops and uses the chronic exposure does not exceed 10% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) such studies are not needed.
The storage stability data provided show that triflumizole and the metabolites FM-6-1, FD-2-1 and FA-1-1 are stable at 20캜 for at least 6 months in high acid and high water commodities.
According to the metabolism studies on cucumber and grapes, a residue definition for monitoring is proposed as the sum of triflumizole and metabolite FM-6-1 ((1E)-N'-[4-chloro-2-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-2-propoxyethanimidamide), expressed as triflumizole. Considering that further metabolites containing the 4-chloro-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group were identified in the metabolism studies, the residue definition for risk assessment is proposed as the sum of triflumizole and metabolites containing the 4-chloro-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group. The proposed residue definitions are limited to fruit crops only. Metabolism studies also allow deriving a worst-case conversion factor from enforcement to risk assessment of 1.5.
A validated method for enforcement of the proposed residue definition in all matrices with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.02 mg/kg is available. Analytical standards for triflumizole and for its FM-6-1 metabolite are commercially available.
Regarding the magnitude of residues, the available data are considered sufficient to derive MRL proposals as well as risk assessment values for all commodities under evaluation. However, since residue trials analysing simultaneously for enforcement and risk assessment residue definitions are not available, all derived MRLs should be considered as tentative only.
Triflumizole is not authorised for use on crops that might be fed to livestock in the EU. Therefore, an investigation of residues, as well as the setting of MRLs in commodities of animal origin, is not necessary.
Chronic and acute exposure calculations for all crops reported in the framework of this review were performed using revision 2 of the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo). The highest chronic exposure was calculated for WHO cluster diet B, representing 3% of the ADI, and the highest acute exposure was calculated for tomatoes, representing 68% of the acute reference dose (ARfD). Although major uncertainties remain due to the data gaps identified, EFSA concludes that for all currently

proposed uses of triflumizole, this indicative exposure calculation did not indicate a risk to consumers. The use of triflumizole was previously also assessed by the Joint Meeting on Pesticide residues (JMPR). However, considering that a different residue definition for enforcement was derived by the JMPR, existing codex maximum residue limits (CXLs) could not further be considered by EFSA for consumer risk assessment.

Review of the existing MRLs for triflumizole
Background
Regulation (EC) No 396/20051 (hereinafter referred to as `the Regulation') establishes the rules governing the setting and the review of pesticide maximum residue levels (MRLs) at European level. Article 12(1) of that Regulation stipulates that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) shall provide, within 12 months from the date of the inclusion or non-inclusion of an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC2 a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing MRLs for that active substance. In 2008, a decision on the non-inclusion of the active substance was taken by Commission Decision 2008/748/EC.3 The applicant submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure regarding the inclusion of the active substance in Annex I of Directive 91/414/EEC. Based on the EFSA conclusion which was issued on 4 December 2009 (EFSA, 2009), the decision to approve the active substance triflumizole in accordance with the provision of Regulation (EC) 1107/2009, repealing the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC, was taken. As triflumizole was included in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 July 2010 by means of Commission Directive 2010/27/EC,4 and has been deemed to be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/20095, in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/20116, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/20117, EFSA initiated the review of all existing MRLs for that active substance.
According to the legal provisions, EFSA shall base its reasoned opinion in particular on the relevant assessment report prepared under Directive 91/414/EEC. It should be noted, however, that, in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC, only a few representative uses are evaluated, whereas MRLs set out in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should accommodate all uses authorised within the European Union (EU), and uses authorised in third countries that have a significant impact on international trade. The information included in the assessment report prepared under Directive 91/414/EEC is therefore insufficient for the assessment of all existing MRLs for a given active substance.
To gain an overview of the pesticide residues data that have been considered for the setting of the existing MRLs, EFSA developed the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile). The PROFile is an inventory of all pesticide residues data relevant to the risk assessment and MRL setting for a given active substance. This includes data on:
 the nature and magnitude of residues in primary crops;  the nature and magnitude of residues in processed commodities;  the nature and magnitude of residues in rotational crops;  the nature and magnitude of residues in livestock commodities;  the analytical methods for enforcement of the proposed MRLs.
The Netherlands, the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS) in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC, was asked to complete the PROFile for triflumizole and to prepare a supporting evaluation report (Netherlands, 2010). The PROFile and the supporting evaluation report were submitted to EFSA on 28 February 2010 and made available to the Member States. A request for additional information was addressed to the Member States in the framework of a completeness check period which was initiated by EFSA on 17 July 2016 and finalised on 17 September 2016. Additional evaluation reports were submitted by Belgium, the Netherlands and the EU Reference Laboratories (EURLs) (Belgium, 2016; EURLs, 2016, Netherlands, 2016) and, after having considered all the information provided by

Review of the existing MRLs for triflumizole

RMS and Member States, EFSA prepared a completeness check report which was made available to all Member States on 17 November 2016. No further clarifications were sought from Member States.
EFSA prepared in January 2017 a draft reasoned opinion, which was submitted to Member States for commenting via a written procedure based on the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC, the MRLs established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (codex maximum residue limit; CXLs) and the additional information provided by the Member States and EURLs. All comments received by 16 February 2017 were considered by EFSA during the finalisation of the reasoned opinion.
The evaluation report submitted by the RMS (Netherlands, 2010) and the evaluation reports submitted by Member States (Belgium, 2016; Netherlands, 2016) and the EURLs (2016) are considered as supporting documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, are made publicly available.
In addition, key supporting documents to this reasoned opinion are the completeness check report (EFSA, 2016) and the Member States consultation report (EFSA, 2017). These reports are developed to address all issues raised in the course of the review, from the initial completeness check to the reasoned opinion. Also, the chronic and acute exposure calculations for all crops reported in the framework of this review performed using the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) and the PROFile are key supporting documents and made publicly available.
Considering the importance of the completeness check and consultation report, all documents are considered as background documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, are made publicly available.
Terms of Reference
According to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, EFSA shall provide a reasoned opinion on:
 the inclusion of the active substance in Annex IV to the Regulation, when appropriate;  the necessity of setting new MRLs for the active substance or deleting/modifying existing MRLs
set out in Annex II or III of the Regulation;
 the inclusion of the recommended MRLs in Annex II or III to the Regulation;  the setting of specific processing factors as referred to in Article 20(2) of the Regulation.
The active substance and its use pattern
Triflumizole is the ISO common name for (E)-4-chloro-a,a,a-trifluoro-N-(1-imidazol-1-yl-2propoxyethylidene)-o-toluidine (IUPAC).
Triflumizole belongs to the group of azole compounds which are used as fungicides. Triflumizole is a fungicide with protective and curative action. It inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol by inhibiting the C14-demethylation in sterol. Ergosterol is considered to function as a stabiliser of the cell wall membranes of fungi.
The chemical structure of the active substance and its main metabolites are reported in Appendix E.
Triflumizole was evaluated in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC with the Netherlands designated as rapporteur Member State (RMS). The representative uses supported for the peer review process comprised indoor foliar spraying against powdery mildew in cucumber, courgette, gherkin, tomato and ornamentals growing on artificial substrate. Following the first decision on non-inclusion of the active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, the applicant submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure regarding the inclusion of the active substance in Annex I of Directive 91/414/EEC. Following the peer review, which was carried out by EFSA, a decision on inclusion of the active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC was published by means of Commission Directive Commission Directive 2010/27/EC which entered into force on 1 July 2010. According to Regulation (EU) No 540/2011, triflumizole is deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. This approval is restricted to uses as fungicide in greenhouse on artificial substrates only.
The EU MRLs for triflumizole are established in Annex IIIA of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 and CXLs for triflumizole were also established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC).
For the purpose of this MRL review, the critical uses of triflumizole currently authorised within the EU, as well as uses authorised in third countries that might have a significant impact on international trade, have been collected by the RMS and reported in the PROFile. The additional Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) reported by Member States during the completeness check were also considered. The details of the authorised GAPs for active substance are given in Appendix A.

Assessment
EFSA has based its assessment on the PROFile submitted by the RMS, the evaluation report accompanying the PROFile (Netherlands, 2010), the draft assessment report (DAR) (Netherlands, 2006) prepared under Council Directive 91/414/EEC, the additional report to the draft assessment report and the final addendum to the additional report prepared under the framework of resubmission according to Regulation 33/20088 (Netherlands, 2009a,b), the conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triflumizole (EFSA, 2009) as well as the evaluation reports submitted during the completeness check (Belgium, 2016; EURLs, 2016; Netherlands, 2016). The assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation of plant protection products as set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20119 and the currently applicable guidance documents relevant for the consumer risk assessment of pesticide residues (European Commission, 1997a-g, 2000, 2010a,b, 2016; OECD, 2011, 2013).
More detailed information on the available data and on the conclusions derived by EFSA can be retrieved from the list of end points reported in Appendix B.

Residues in plants

1.1. Nature of residues and methods of analysis in plants

1.1.1. Nature of residues in primary crops
During the peer review, the metabolism of triflumizole following foliar application on grape and cucumber was relied upon. Results from two additional metabolism studies on apples and pears were evaluated but not considered reliable.
In cucumber fruit, the parent represented the major compound during the whole duration of the study (14 days), representing up to 80% of the total radioactive residue (TRR) 3 days after treatment (DAT). The metabolite FM-6-1 is present with 9.1% TRR 3 DAT increasing slowly with increasing DAT. Notably, the concentration of metabolite FM-8-1 increased and represented up to 8.2% TRR 21 DAT and represented the major metabolite 45 DAT (Netherlands, 2009b). Additional metabolites were identified however remained below 3% of the TRR.
A similar profile was observed in the grape metabolism study, where the parent was the main compound (87%, 3 DAT) and the metabolite FM-6-1 increased slowly from 0.2% TRR (3 DAT) to 11.1% TRR (67 DAT). The metabolite FM-8-1 increased to 4.9% TRR 67 DAT and metabolite FD-2-1 to 5.1% TRR. In addition other minor metabolites such as FD-1-1, FD-6-1 and FD-7-1 were observed at 2.47%, 1.73% and 1.2% TRR (Netherlands, 2009b).

1.1.2. Nature of residues in rotational crops
Triflumizole is authorised on crops that can be grown in rotation. However, according to Commission Directive 2010/27/EC only uses as fungicide in greenhouses on artificial substrates may be authorised. Succeeding crop studies are not provided and are not considered necessary because the current use of triflumizole is for substrate culture only. During the peer review, it was further concluded that studies on degradation in soil are not required for uses on artificial substrate.
It has to be noted that in case the intended use would change to non-substrate culture of crops, this issue has to be reconsidered.

1.1.3. Nature of residues in processed commodities
Studies investigating the effect of processing on the nature of the residue are not available. Considering that for the considered crops and uses the chronic exposure does not exceed 10% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) such studies are not needed.

Review of the existing MRLs for triflumizole
1.1.4. Methods of analysis in plants
In the framework of this review, a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) detection (HPLC-MS/MS) was considered suitable for monitoring triflumizole and FM-6-1 in high water commodities, with a combined limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.04 mg/kg. The method was validated by independent laboratory validation (ILV) with a combined LOQ of 0.02 mg/kg for the parent and the metabolite FM-6-1 (Netherlands, 2009a).
According to the information provided by the EU Reference Laboratories (EURLs) during the completeness check, a combined LOQ of 0.02 mg/kg for triflumizole and FM-6-1 (validated in high water, acid, dry and high oil content commodities) is achievable for routine analyses by using the QuEChERS (liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)) method (EURLs, 2016).
1.1.5. Stability of residues in plants
The storage stability was evaluated during the peer review and a data gap was identified because it was concluded that storage stability period of triflumizole was one and not four months. The RMS provided additional storage stability studies in the evaluation report (Netherlands, 2010). From the provided data, it can be concluded that triflumizole parent, FM-6-1, FD-2-1 and FA-1-1 are stable at 20캜 for at least 6 months in high acid and high water commodities.
1.1.6. Proposed residue definitions
According to the metabolism studies on cucumber and grapes outlined in Section 1.1.1, a residue definition for monitoring is proposed as the sum of triflumizole and metabolite FM-6-1 ((1E)-N'-[4chloro-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-2-propoxyethanimidamide), expressed as triflumizole.
Considering that further metabolites containing the 4-chloro-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group were identified in the metabolism studies, the residue definition for risk assessment is proposed as the sum of triflumizole and metabolites containing the 4-chloro-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group.
The proposed residue definitions are limited to fruit crops only. A worst-case conversion factor from enforcement to risk assessment of 1.5 as derived from the metabolism studies is also proposed.
A validated method for enforcement of the proposed residue definition in high water and high acid commodities with an LOQ of 0.02 mg/kg is available. Analytical standards for triflumizole and for its FM-6-1 metabolite are commercially available.
1.2. Magnitude of residues in plants
1.2.1. Magnitude of residues in primary crops
To assess the magnitude of triflumizole residues resulting from the reported GAPs, EFSA considered all residue trials reported by the RMS in its evaluation report (Netherlands, 2010), including residue trials evaluated in the framework of the peer review (EFSA, 2009) and additional data submitted during the completeness check (Belgium, 2016; Netherlands, 2016). All residue trial samples considered in this framework were stored in compliance with the demonstrated storage conditions. Decline of residues during storage of the trial samples is therefore not expected.
The number of residue trials and extrapolations were evaluated in accordance with the European guidelines on comparability, extrapolation, group tolerances and data requirements for setting MRLs (European Commission, 2016).
For cucumbers, gherkins and courgettes, the number of residue trials reported is not compliant with the data requirements, only tentative MRL and risk assessment values could be derived by EFSA and the following data gaps were identified:
 four additional trials on cucumber compliant with the indoor GAP for cucumber, gherkin and
courgettes are required. It is also noted that a different GAP for cucumbers and courgettes is authorised in the Netherlands but not supported by data. Therefore, eight residue trials compliant with the GAP provided by the Netherlands are also still required.
For tomatoes and aubergines, available residue trials are sufficient to derive MRL and risk assessment values, taking note of the following considerations:

www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal

9

EFSA Journal 2017;15(3):4749

Review of the existing MRLs for triflumizole

 all available trials were performed with three instead of four applications. However, since the
first application according to the application conditions reported in the most critical GAP (cGAP), is expected to be done at an early growth stage and therefore not expected to have a significant impact on the final residue level, this is considered as a minor deficiency. It is also noted that a more cGAP for tomatoes is authorised in the Netherlands but not supported by data. Therefore, eight residue trials compliant with the GAPs in the Netherlands are still required.
It has to be noted that the available residue trials were all analysed according to the residue definition for enforcement. Analytical results according to the residue definition for risk assessment are not available and would be required. Therefore, the input values for risk assessment were tentatively calculated by applying a worst-case factor as outlined in Section 1.1.6.

1.2.2. Magnitude of residues in rotational crops
Considering the approval restrictions as reported in Section 1.1.2 for substrate culture only, crop rotation is not expected to occur. Succeeding and rotational crop studies are therefore not considered necessary and were not provided. In case different uses will be granted in the future, this issue may need to be reconsidered.

1.2.3. Magnitude of residues in processed commodities
Studies investigating the effect of processing on the magnitude of the residue are not available. Considering that for the considered crops and uses the chronic exposure does not exceed 10% of the ADI such studies are not needed.

1.2.4. Proposed MRLs
Consequently, the available data are considered sufficient to derive MRL proposals as well as risk assessment values for all commodities under evaluation. However, since residue trials analysing simultaneously for enforcement and risk assessment residue definitions are not available, all derived MRLs should be considered as tentative only.

2.

Residues in livestock

Triflumizole is not authorised for use on crops that might be fed to livestock. Further investigation of the occurrence of residues in commodities of animal origin is not required and the setting of MRLs in these commodities is not considered necessary.

3.

Consumer risk assessment

In the framework of this review, only the uses of triflumizole reported by the RMS in Appendix A were considered; however, the use of triflumizole was previously also assessed by the Joint Meeting on Pesticide residues (JMPR) (FAO, 2013a,b). The codex maximum residue limits (CXLs), resulting from this assessment by the JMPR and adopted by the CAC, are now international recommendations that need to be considered by European risk managers when establishing MRLs. Considering, however, that a different residue definition for enforcement of residues analysed as 4-chloro-2-(trifluoromethyl)aniline expressed as parent triflumizole was derived by the JMPR, existing CXLs could not further be considered by EFSA for consumer risk assessment.
Chronic and acute exposure calculations for all crops reported in the framework of this review were performed using revision 2 of the EFSA PRIMo (EFSA, 2007). Input values for the exposure calculations were derived in compliance with the decision tree reported in Appendix D. Hence, for those commodities where a tentative MRL could be derived by EFSA in the framework of this review, input values were derived according to the internationally agreed methodologies (FAO, 2009). All input values included in the exposure calculations are summarised in Appendix C.
The exposures calculated were compared with the toxicological reference values for triflumizole, derived by EFSA under Directive 91/414/EEC. The highest chronic exposure was calculated for WHO cluster diet B, representing 3% of the ADI, and the highest acute exposure was calculated for tomatoes, representing 68% of the acute reference dose (ARfD). Although major uncertainties remain due to the data gaps identified in the previous sections, this indicative exposure calculation did not indicate a risk to consumers.

Conclusions
During the peer review, the metabolism of triflumizole following foliar application on grape and cucumber was relied upon. Similar residue profiles were obtained from both metabolism studies, where the parent was the main compound (80-87% TRR) and the metabolite FM-6-1 increased slowly up to 11% TRR following treatment. Additional metabolites were identified however remained below 10% of the TRR.
Triflumizole is authorised on crops that can be grown in rotation. However, according to Commission Directive 2010/27/EC only uses as fungicide in greenhouses on artificial substrates may be authorised. Succeeding crop studies are not provided and are not considered necessary because the current use of triflumizole is for substrate culture only.
Studies investigating the effect of processing on the nature and magnitude of the residue are not available. Bearing in mind that for the considered crops and uses the chronic exposure does not exceed 10% of the ADI, such studies are not needed.
The storage stability data provided show that triflumizole and the metabolites FM-6-1, FD-2-1 and FA-1-1 are stable at 20캜 for at least 6 months in high acid and high water commodities.
According to the metabolism studies on cucumber and grapes, a residue definition for monitoring is proposed as the sum of triflumizole and metabolite FM-6-1 ((1E)-N'-[4-chloro-2-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-2-propoxyethanimidamide), expressed as triflumizole. Considering that further metabolites containing the 4-chloro-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group were identified in the metabolism studies, the residue definition for risk assessment is proposed as the sum of triflumizole and metabolites containing the 4-chloro-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group. The proposed residue definitions are limited to fruit crops only. Metabolism studies also allow deriving a worst-case conversion factor from enforcement to risk assessment of 1.5.
A validated method for enforcement of the proposed residue definition in all matrices with an LOQ of 0.02 mg/kg is available. Analytical standards for triflumizole and for its FM-6-1 metabolite are commercially available.
Regarding the magnitude of residues, the available data are considered sufficient to derive MRL proposals as well as risk assessment values for all commodities under evaluation. However, since residue trials analysing simultaneously for enforcement and risk assessment residue definitions are not available, all derived MRLs should be considered as tentative only.
Triflumizole is not authorised for use on crops that might be fed to livestock in the EU. Therefore, an investigation of residues, as well as the setting of MRLs in commodities of animal origin, is not necessary.
Chronic and acute exposure calculations for all crops reported in the framework of this review were performed using revision 2 of the EFSA PRIMo. The highest chronic exposure was calculated for WHO cluster diet B, representing 3% of the ADI, and the highest acute exposure was calculated for tomatoes, representing 68% of the ARfD. Although major uncertainties remain due to the data gaps identified, EFSA concludes that for all currently proposed uses of triflumizole, this indicative exposure calculation did not indicate a risk to consumers. The use of triflumizole was previously also assessed by the JMPR. However, considering that a different residue definition for enforcement was derived by the JMPR, existing CXLs could not further be considered by EFSA for consumer risk assessment.
Recommendations
MRL recommendations were derived in compliance with the decision tree reported in Appendix D of the reasoned opinion (see Table 1).
None of the MRL values listed in the table are recommended for inclusion in Annex II to the Regulation as they are not sufficiently supported by data (see summary table footnotes for details). In particular, all tentative MRLs need to be confirmed by the following data:
 Complete sets of residue trials supporting the authorisations for all crops under assessment,
analysing simultaneously for monitoring and risk assessment residue definitions.
It is highlighted, however, that some of the MRLs derived result from an indoor GAP authorised in Belgium while other GAPs reported by the RMS were not supported by data. EFSA therefore identified the following data gaps which are not expected to impact on the validity of the MRLs derived but which might have an impact on national authorisations:

 eight residue trials compliant with the GAP provided by the Netherlands for cucumbers and
courgettes;
 eight residue trials compliant with the GAP provided by the Netherlands for tomatoes.
If the above reported data gaps are not addressed in the future, Member States are recommended to withdraw or modify the relevant authorisations at national level.

PODCAST CAPSULE SUMMARY The Practice of Emergency Medicine
Emergency department boarding: The canary in the coal mine

The author has stated that no such relationships exist. JACEP Open's podcasts aim to spotlight the journal's most interesting and controversial articles. Listen to the full podcast at https://soundcloud.com/jacepopen.

Emergency department (ED) boarding, defined by the American College of Emergency Physicians as anyone who "remains in the ED after the patient has been admitted or placed into observation status," is a growing problem and frequent reality for physicians across a wide variety of settings in the United States.1 In this month's JACEP Open podcast, we discuss the recent article by Smalley et al2 and explore the potential dangers of ED boarding from the top of the health system down to the patient left sitting in the waiting room.
1 THE MISSING METRIC?
Walking into a crowded waiting room last night I heard a staff member tell a patient, "I'm sorry for the wait; the whole hospital is full and everyone is really busy." On the surface this statement makes sense, yet Smalley et al found an inverse relationship between overall occupancy and emergency department (ED) wait times. These findings suggest that prolonged wait times in the ED may in fact be a reliable and reproducible marker of inefficiency within the health system rather than being a byproduct of a system running at full speed. As increasing scrutiny is placed on metrics such as percentage of patients who leave without being seen and time from arrival to ED discharge, ED boarding should be an increasingly helpful statistic.3
2 BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING
From an administrative standpoint, prolonged ED wait times related to ED boarding come with a significant host of potential problems,

including allegations of violating the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). Under EMTALA, departments "may not delay access to screening, stabilizing treatment."4 In a busy waiting room, any delay between patient arrival and this mandated screening could open up a hospital to allegations of an EMTALA violation.
3 STUCK IN THE MIDDLE
From a patient care standpoint, ED boarding appears to have the greatest impact on potentially high-risk patients. Nationwide, various staffing models and flow modifications have been developed to quickly take care of the sickest patients (triage Emergency Severity Index (ESI) scores 1, 2) and those with less acute complaints (ESI 4, 5). Although these efforts may improve current metrics such as time from arrival to being seen by a clinician, they may have the unintended consequence of filling ED beds, consuming clinician resources, and contributing to ED boarding. Consequently, patients with mid-range triage scores (ESI 3), who make up more than one third of ED patients nationwide, may be stuck in the waiting room as the sickest and least sick patients are seen first.5 Smalley et al2 found that patients with an ESI score of 3 had the longest wait times despite having an overall admission rate of 27%. As rates of ED boarding increase, this large cohort of patients with moderate ESI scores is left stuck in the waiting room waiting.
Smalley et al2 make a compelling argument that increased rates of ED boarding can affect us all. For hospitals and departments, ED boarding likely reflects overall efficiency. For individual patients, focusing on ED boarding may allow us to provide expedited care for a subset of patients who are often overlooked in the mad dash for efficiency.

Abstract Background Pembrolizumab is a new drug approved in several countries for second-line therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) being programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1) positive. This drug has a high cost, and the costeffectiveness ratio has been debated. Patients and methods The budget impact to the Northern Norwegian Regional Health Authority trust of implementing pembrolizumab in second-line therapy in patients with PD-L1-positive NSCLC was calculated. A model was developed employing data from the Cancer Registry of Norway, the KEYNOTE-010 study, the price list from The Hospital Pharmacy of North Norway, the cost of analysing PD-L1 expression and the cost of travelling. Today's cost of second-line therapy was compared with the new standard employing pembrolizumab. The sale price of pembrolizumab in Norway was not published due to price confidentiality. Norwegian krone (NKr) was converted into Euros () at a rate of 1=Nkr 8.8138. (Bank of Norway, 21 February 2017). Results 105 new patients were identified available for pembrolizumab per year. The annual cost of pembrolizumab was 5.2million, hospital pharmacy administration costs 0.1million, PD-L1 testing 0.3million, oncologist/pulmonologist/nurses 0.2million, radiology 0.06million and transportation 0.4million. Savings due to avoided present second-line therapy was calculated 0.4million. Consequently, the cost of implementing pembrolizumab was 5.5million and the annual budget impact was 5.0million. A mean gain of at least 9 months per patient treated was necessary to make pembrolizumab cost-effective. Conclusions The net budget impact of pembrolizumab was 5.0million. The expenditure could not be indicated cost-effective. Price confidentiality is a growing problem in health economics and it has become a `menu without prices' setting.
Introduction In Norway, about 3000 patients are diagnosed with lung cancer each year and the figure is expected to rise to 3700 cases in 2025.1-4 Most cases are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the median age at diagnosis is 70 years. A total of 85% of all patients are initially

Key questions
What is already known about this subject?  This is a new drug in NSCLC being PD-L1 positive.
It is costly. The cost-effectiveness has been heavily debated. What does this study add?  This study documents the budget impact in northern Norway and illustrates the costs and savings that have to be considered. It also documents the necessary gain needed to make this drug costeffective. How might this impact on clinical practice?  The possible impact may be an awareness of the costs and the importance of price negotiations. Hopefully, price secrecy may be abandoned.
diagnosed with or develop advanced stage of disease (stage III or IV) during follow-up.
First-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC has traditionally been the use of a platinum doublet therapy. The combination of carboplatin and vinorelbin has shown less toxicity.5 Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations have also been offered specific targeting treatments.1 Tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors (erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib) have been employed in EGFR mutations and crizotinib in ALK translocations. Patients progressing on firstline therapy experiencing good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status 0-1) have traditionally been offered single-drug regimens consisting of docetaxel, pemetrexed, erlotinib or gemcitabine. The median overall survival has been reported between 5.7-9.3 months1 and 1-year overall survival around 30%.5 6

ligand (PD-L1) expression.7-9 Due to the significant cost of pembrolizumab, this therapy will obviously have a significant impact on the hospitals' budgets. In this study, we aimed to clarify this impact and discuss whether this therapy can be considered cost-effective.
Materials and methods We calculated the budget impact to the Northern Norwegian Regional Healthcare Authority (NNRHA) trust of implementing pembrolizumab (instead of docetaxel or pemetrexed) as standard second-line therapy in advanced (stage III) or metastatic (stage IV) NSCLC with PD-L1 expression. A model-based cost-minimising analysis was performed. The model included two alternatives: pembrolizumab 2mg/kg or standard second-line therapy.1 Alternatives employed in second-line therapy in Norway are docetaxel, pemetrexed, navelbine, erlotinib and gefitinib. The majority of patients are treated with docetaxel and some with pemetrexed (non-squamous cell carcinoma). Two clinicians, working daily with patients with lung cancer at our two major hospitals, were included in the development of the model. The model is shown in figure 1.
Population Norwegian guidelines1 state that immunotherapy with pembrolizumab should be considered in patients with good performance status (ECOG 0-1) and PD-L1-expressing NSCLC. The PD-L1 expression was set to at least 1%.1 7 According to Norwegian data,3 northern Norway had 10.3% of all lung cancers in Norway. In 2015, there were 3035 cases, 84% of them were NSCLC and 70% of patients had an advanced stage of disease (stage III or IV) at the time of diagnosis.4 Half of the patients with localised disease developed distant metastasis during follow-up. Consequently, 85% of patients were potential candidates for pembrolizumab therapy. However, according to the clinicians' experience, 30% of these patients would, due to poor performance status (ECOG >1) and/or short life expectancy (<3 months), not be candidates for secondline chemotherapy. Furthermore, two-thirds do have a PD-L1 expression in at least 1% of tumour cells.7
Costs All costs and savings were calculated from the healthcare's point of view, and Norwegian krone (NKr) was
2

converted into Euros () at a rate of 1=8.8138NKr (Bank of Norway, 21 February 2017). Cost of the analysis of PD-L1 status was based on data from the Department of Pathology at the University Hospital of North Norway (UNN) and Nordland Hospital (NH), respectively. Together, they argued for one biomedical laboratory scientist (79 421/year) and the total need for clinical pathologist resources was calculated a half position (110 959/year). Costs connected to personnel included employers' costs due to pension and social costs (30%). The cost per Dako-kit was 7148; 380 tests per year and 25 cases per kit was calculated. Consequently, the total number of kits was 25 annually.
MRI or CT is the most commonly employed imaging tool to document the disease status and evaluate treatment effects in NSCLC. On the basis of the clinicians' advice, we calculated CT as the main tool, and 5% of patients in the pembrolizumab arm were assumed undergoing additionally MRI due to suspected cerebral metastasis. Furthermore, a total of 20% of patients were concluded undergoing CT-guided biopsy to achieve the necessary tissue to clarify PD-L1 status. The 2016 price list of the Norwegian Health Economics Administration (NHEA) was used.10 Norwegian hospital trusts are financed partly on activity and partly on basic funding, with equal shares. Consequently, the NHEA figures were doubled when calculating costs. Evaluation was performed every ninth week during treatment.
Drug cost and drug administration cost were obtained from the Hospital Pharmacy of North Norway, as of 1 January 2017. The selling price of pembrolizumab is a secret between the manufacturer Merck, Sharp & Dohme (MSD) and the Norwegian Hospital Procurement trust. Consequently, due to price confidentiality, we cannot publish data making the price available to third parties. The mean treatment time in the docetaxel arm was 4.7 cycles and consequently 5.7 outpatient visits were calculated.7 In the pembrolizumab arm, several patients were under therapy when the study was reported. On the basis of the data on the Norwegian Medicines Agency (NMA),9 Huang and colleagues,11 results presented at 17th World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) in Vienna in December 2016 and the qualified guess of our group of clinicians, we estimated the mean number of cycles. The number of cycles cannot be given due to price confidentiality. Furthermore, patients' mean weight was calculated to 75kg and the height was 179.6cm, based on data from Statistics Norway (www.ssb.n o). The Mosteller method12 was employed to calculate the body surface area (1.93m2). We did not reveal any information about significant differences in treatments following progression in the docetaxel or pembrolizumab arm. We, therefore, did not include any differences in costs of third-line therapy or costs of end-of-life therapy.
The cost of present standard second-line therapy was calculated according to the selling price of docetaxel and pemetrexed at the Pharmacy of Northern Norway trust. A dose of 75mg/m2 was employed and the pharmacy

production/administration cost was included. Similarly, the cost of pemetrexed was calculated at a dose of 500mg/ m2. The selling price of pemetrexed and docetaxel was confidential between the manufacturers and the Norwegian Hospital Procurement trust. To avoid revealing trade secrets and after a careful comparison of the calculated costs and the refunds according to the diagnosis-related group (DRG) system (DRG 856D, 1227), we concluded to employ the latter in our calculation.13 This refund was meant to compensate the expenses, but negotiations over price had somewhat lowered the cost.
The extra resources of oncologist/pulmonologist/ nurses needed, due to prolonged therapy, were estimated by the clinicians to 153169.
Costs due to patient travelling were based on data from The Health Enterprises' Centre for Patient Journeys. According to regional guidelines, all patients undergoing pembrolizumab therapy were referred to the two main hospitals, UNN in Troms and NH in Bod. In the docetaxel or pemetrexed alternative, patients were treated at their local hospitals. Consequently, the distribution of the patients within the region and their nearest hospital offering the actual therapy was employed when calculating travelling expenses.
Patient shares were included according to the price list of outpatient clinics (39/visit).10 Similarly, the patient's share was calculated 28 per CT or MR examination.10
The northern Norwegian hospitals do also have incomes. Consequently, when measuring budget impact, these incomes have to be included. Our patient clinics are partly financed by patients' shares and refunding based on the DRG system.13 In this setting, the DRG 856D was employed (1227).
Willingness to pay and loss of prognosis In Norway, the willingness to pay is based on the severity of the disease.14 The severity is measured employing the quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) method. The mean age, among patients diagnosed with NSCLC, was 70 years. We have no quality-of-life data for the general population in Norway and, therefore, we employed the Swedish data.15 On the basis of these data, the QALE of 70-year-old persons, in general, is 11 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). On the basis of the knowledge that NSCLC is more common among males, males having a shorter life expectancy and the life expectancy of patients undergoing second-line therapy for advanced or metastatic NSCLC is <1year, we calculated a loss of 10 QALYs among patients diagnosed with advanced or metastatic NSCLC. In such a setting, the willingness to pay among Norwegian healthcare administrators is somewhere between 57000 and 68000 per QALY.14
Results Costs We calculated 105 patients available for pembrolizumab therapy in northern Norway each year. Furthermore, the

total cost of documenting the PD-L1 status, including bioengineer, pathologist and Dako-kit was calculated to a total of 301.527. The corresponding costs of radiological examinations (CT, MR and CT-guided biopsy) were 60536 and 32398 in the pembrolizumab and docetaxel or pemetrexed arm, respectively. The annual drug cost of pembrolizumab was 5 178 026 and the administration/production cost at the pharmacy was 87911. The corresponding cost of the pharmacy expenses in the docetaxel or pemetrexed arm was 605551 or 37 906, respectively. The total increased need of nurse/oncologist/ pulmonologist resources in the pembrolizumab arm was estimated 153169. Travel expenses in the pembrolizumab arm and docetaxel or pemetrexed arm were calculated as 430909 and 95 144, respectively.
Income Norwegian hospitals get half of their funding through the DRG system. However, the present DRG has not included the cost of pembrolizumab and, consequently, the income does not reflect this cost. In total, the DRG income was calculated as 702181 and the patient shares were 48909 in the pembrolizumab alternative. The corresponding figures in the docetaxel or pemetrexed arm was 302775 and 23 427, respectively.
Budget impact The total cost implementing pembrolizumab in the specialised healthcare in northern Norway was 5.5million and the annual net budget influencing 5.0million. The mean increased cost per patient treated was 48000. An overview is shown in table 1.
Cost-effectiveness On the basis of the budget impact of  5.0million and the willingness to pay between 57000 and 68,000, about 80 life-years have to be gained per year to reach the level of recommended use. Consequently, each patient treated (105 patients/year) with pembrolizumab in northern Norway should gain a mean life expectancy of 9 months to make this therapy cost-effective.
Sensitivity analysis A one-way sensitivity analysis was done to clarify the robustness of the model. The following variables were included in the analysis and varied by +/-20%: patient share, DRG income, travelling expenses, pharmacy administration cost, drug costs, radiology and PD-L1 testing. Details are shown in the tornado diagram in figure 2. Except for drug costs, the other factors had only minor impact on the budget. Consequently, variations in the price of pembrolizumab due to currency fluctuations and negotiations over price will have significant impact on Norwegian hospitals' budgets.
Discussion The annual impact of pembrolizumab on the Northern Norwegian hospitals' budget was 5.0million. The

estimated mean raised cost per patient treated was 50209. The sensitivity analysis documented the price of pembrolizumab having the greatest impact on the result. A mean gain of 9 months per patient treated was necessary to make this treatment cost-effective, given the drug prices stay as of 1 January 2017.
The NMA9 concluded the cost of implementing pembrolizumab in second-line NSCLC in Norway to be 56.7million. This national figure was based on the cost of pembrolizumab prior to negotiations. Knowing the selling price of pembrolizumab and the northern region having 10.3% (5.8million) of all patients with NSCLC, the true costs of implementing this drug was higher than these prior estimations. This was mainly due to higher travelling expenses and the hospitals' membership cost of the Norwegian Hospital Procurement trust, included in the price of pembrolizumab. As we had to employ the

refunds (according to the DRG system), and not the final results of negotiations over price for the comparators, the true difference is even greater.13
The main goal in the second-line treatment of NSCLC is prolonged survival/extended life and second improved quality of life.13 The duration of treatment and survival gain in the pembrolizumab alternative was difficult to estimate.7 In the KEYNOTE-010 study, no patients were treated for more than 24 months and the median follow-up was only 13.1 months. The 1-year survival was 57% and 65% in the two arms. Usually, cancer treatment is discontinued due to progressive disease, toxicity or patient's choice. Whereas all patients had stopped therapy in the docetaxel arm, several patients were still on therapy at evaluation in the pembrolizumab arms.7 The median duration of response was 8 months in the docetaxel arm and not reached in the pembrolizumab arms. Our estimate was based on the fact that no patient achieved complete remission and, consequently, no cure could be anticipated. Some researchers have calculated a `tale of patients' experiencing a prolonged survival.11
We have strongly indicated a significant budget impact by introducing pembrolizumab in second-line NSCLC therapy. On the basis of data from the Cancer Registry of Norway, it may be as long as 40 years before the incidence of lung cancer may start to drop, due to fewer smokers. The CRN has estimated that the total numbers of new lung cancers will increase to 3700 new cases per year in 2025.4 Consequently, the influence on hospitals' budgets will obviously grow.
We did not report the treatment duration calculated in the pembrolizumab arm. This is a significant limitation and was due to secrecy. Trade secrets can be worth tens of hundreds of millions of dollars, and damage awards in trade secret litigation have been high.16 Our concern was due to the agreement between the manufacturer (MSD) and the Norwegian Hospital Procurement Trust, making

it illegal to report the sale price of pembrolizumab in Norway. This has become a growing problem worldwide, making it difficult to undertake and publish health economic analysis on new drugs. The aggressive effort by manufacturers to enforce price confidentiality has been commented by several authors. Lerner and colleagues17 pointed on the fact that secrecy prevents hospitals from revealing prices to third parties that may help them negotiate prices. The price of the drug itself was the major cost in our analysis. Consequently, significant variations in cost may end up in various national conclusions with regard to cost-effectiveness. Unfortunately, this variation in pricing cannot be explored due to price confidentiality. In our neighbouring country, Sweden, significant differences have been revealed between the county councils.18 A Bloomberg report19 mentioned that health insurance companies buy prescription drugs the way US consumers buy cars: there is the sticker price (which few people actually pay) and there is the negotiated price. One of these reports19analysed 39 medicines with global sales of more than US$1billion a year and showed that 30 of them logged price increases of more than double the rate of inflation from 2009 to 2015. One example was imatinib (Glivec), launched in 2001 at a price of US$31930 per year and the corresponding cost in 2015 was US$118,000.20
There have been some advocates for disclosing costs. In the USA, Vermont was the first state to require drug makers to justify price hikes.21 Henrikson et al22 argued that healthcare in the USA had come to resemble a `menu without prices' for both physicians and patients, who systematically lacks access to the price of treatments, procedures and diagnostic tests. This `firewall' may once have served an ethical purpose. However, they22 propose that complete price transparency for people with cancer should be an integral part of patient-centred care. Most people with cancer report wishing to discuss cancer care costs with their providers,23 and patient interest in price data is increasing.24 Trust is a crucial component of the entire physician patient relationship, including cost-related discussions.25
On the basis of our analysis, we cannot conclude whether pembrolizumab is cost-effective. This is due to the fact that we do not know the survival gain. However, the present data from the KEYNOTE-010 study7 were far from the needed 9 months level to make it cost-effective. In the total population, the median overall survival was 10.4 months in the pembrolizumab 2mg/kg arm and 8.5 months in the docetaxel arm, respectively.7 However, as mentioned, several patients were still on therapy in the pembrolizumab arm when the study data were evaluated. In this study, we employed the recommended PD-L1 expression level (>1% of tumour cells).7 Knowing the correlation between PD-L1 expression and differential activity of pembrolizumab, higher levels of expression (ie, >5%) should be explored to define the group making this therapy cost-effective.26

Conclusion The introduction of pembrolizumab in the second-line treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC will have significant impact on healthcare budgets in northern Norway. A mean survival gain of 9 months per patient treated should be achieved to make it cost-effective. The lack of price transparency has made it impossible to run transparent health economic analyses. In the future, various PD-L1 expressions levels for initiation of therapy may be explored.

Abstract. The present study aimed to assess the effects of repairing ventricular septal defects (VSDs) with right vertical infraaxillary miniincision (RVAI). A total of 116 patients with VSDs were prospectively enrolled and underwent cardiac surgery between June 2017 and December 2018 at the cardiac intensive care unit of Shanghai Children's Medical Center (Shanghai, China). Of these, 58 patients underwent the RVAI procedure and 58 patients matched 1:1 underwent the standard median sternotomy incision (MSI) procedure and were desig nated as the control group. The demographic data and clinical outcomes intra and postoperatively were compared. A bedside lung ultrasound was performed to evaluate the degree of lung injury and the number of Blines was quantified and compared between the two groups. The sedation and analgesia levels were also assessed after the operation. No significant difference was identified between the two groups regarding the overall cardiopulmonary bypass or aortic crossclamp time. All patients were extubated within 8 h. The RVAI group had shorter incision lengths (median, 4.6 cm) and less drainage (median, 15 ml) than the MSI group. Furthermore, compared to the MSI group, the RVAI group had a significantly higher number of Blines in the right lung regions immediately after surgery and at 12 h postsurgery (24.1 and 5.2%, respectively) but eventually exhibited no differences at 24 and 36 h post surgery; by contrast, there were no differences in the left lung regions. The bedside bispectral index score and the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale score exhibited no signifi cant differences after the operation. In conclusion, the RVAI

procedure appears to be a safe alternative for repairing VSDs in addition to satisfactory cosmetic results and the incision does not interfere with postoperative analgosedation.
Introduction
Median sternotomy incision (MSI) is considered the usual approach for treating congenital heart defects (CHDs). For simple and common CHDs, such as atrial and ventricular septal defects (VSDs), undesirable cosmetic results and sternotomyrelated complications may limit the number of surgeons who choose to perform median sternotomy procedures (1). Several minimally invasive cardiac surgery techniques have been increasingly explored to overcome these disadvantages (26). Over the past few years, right vertical infraaxillary miniincision (RVAI) has been utilized to obtain reliable cosmetic and functional results in patients with CHDs (7,8). In addition, Dave et al (7) reported that repairs for various congenital defects were similar in quality to standard surgical approaches. However, the patient was placed in a left lateral position and the lung was kept away from the heart during the operation, which may cause detriments to the lung. Irritation to the intercostal nerves during minimally invasive procedures (9) may make postoperative sedation and analgesia difficult. To the best of our knowledge, no similar studies have been reported.
In the present study, MSI and RVAI were compared in terms of their ability to close VSDs, the demographics and clinical outcomes of patients were compared and it was investigated whether this novel technique affects postoperative lung function or postoperative pain.
Materials and methods
Study design. The present study was a prospective cohort study performed at the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) of Shanghai Children's Medical Center (Shanghai, China) and included pediatric patients with VSDs who underwent corrective operations between June 2017 and December 2018. The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine (Shanghai,

Operative technique RVAI approach. After inducing general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position with the right side elevated 4560 and the right arm was wrapped and suspended over the head. A vertical incision was made on the right midaxil lary line of the skin from the second to the fifth ribs and the surgical route generally went through the fourth intercostal space. After the defect was closed, a pericardial drain was inserted. The subcutaneous tissue and skin were sutured in layers (7).
MSI approach. With the patient in the supine position, the heart was exposed through a classic midline sternotomy. The sternum was divided wholly and filled with wax to stop the bleeding. Through aortic, inferior and superior vena caval cannulations, a mildly hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established. After the defect was closed, a pericardial drain was inserted and the divided sternum was closed with nonabsorbable sutures. The subcutaneous tissue and skin were sutured in layers.
Patient selection. All patients included in the present study had VSDs diagnosed by physical examinations, chest Xray, elec trocardiography, transthoracic color Doppler echocardiography and CT. A flow chart of the selection of the study population is provided in Fig. 1. In total, 58 patients underwent surgery with the RVAI technique between June 2017 and December 2018 (RVAI group). To balance the major prognostic factors, a 1:1 matchedpairs casecontrol methodology was designed and the control group underwent the standard MSI procedure (MSI group). The patients of each group were similarly matched in terms of corresponding heart defects, year of surgery, body weight (the difference was 2 kg) and patching (Table I).
The intraoperative variables (aortic clamp time and cardiopulmonary bypass time) were recorded in both groups. Furthermore, the extubation time was evaluated with early extubation defined as mechanical ventilation that lasted for <8 h postoperatively. The incision length and drainage volume were also calculated (Table I).
Lung ultrasonography examination. After the patients returned to the CICU, the right and left lungs were routinely examined by ultrasound (every 12 h) to evaluate the injury with Blines (10) immediately after surgery (H0) at 12 h postoperatively (H12), as well as H24 and H36. The number of Blines was summed up to generate quantitative or semiquantitative Bline scores. The lung ultrasound probe requires a highfrequency linear array of >7.5 MHz. Lung ultrasonography (LUS) examinations were performed according to the methodology described by Copetti and Cattarossi (11). The patients were positioned in a supine, lateral or prone position. The lung field was divided into three areas by the midclavicular line and anterior axillary line. The regions of the bilateral lung were scanned with the probe, which was held vertical or parallel to the ribs. Each region was scanned in the longitudinal and transverse planes and in the mediallateral and cranialcaudal directions, respectively.
Sedation and analgesia assessment. The patients returned to the CICU with a bispectral index score (BIS) monitor (BIS

Vista model; Aspect Medical Systems) until the day they left the CICU. The BIS monitor was able to assess the anes thetic state of the central nervous system. The BIS scores ranged from 0 to 100 (0, coma; 4060, general anesthesia; 6090, sedated; 100, awake) and reflect the level of seda tion (12). The BIS scale was used to assess the sedation level at the CICU every 4 h after the operations (H0, H4, H8, H12;). The Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) scale was used to assess the analgesia level at the bedside after the patient was weaned from ventilation (H8, H12). The FLACC scale consists of 5 categories (face, legs, activity, cry and conso lability), each with a score between 0 and 2, with 10 being the full score; scores of 0 to 3, 4 to 7 and 8 to 10 represent no/light pain, moderate pain and acute pain, respectively. The FLACC scale is reliable and valid for the assessment of systematic pain in children (13). There were no differences in the application of anesthesia, sedation and analgesia medication between the two groups. Both imidazole 2 킽/kg/min and dexmedetomi dine 0.5 킽/kg/h were provided for 16 h.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 19.0 (IBM Corp.). Data following a normal distribution are expressed as the median (range) or as the mean  standard deviation. Variables were compared between the RVAI and MSI groups using a MannWhitney U test for data with equal proportions or Fisher's exact test where numbers were small with results presented as n (%). The statis tical tests were twosided. All the analyses were performed on an intenttotreat basis and a twosided P<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

Evaluation postoperative lung impairment and analgosedation. In the right lung, the patients in the RVAI group exhibited signifi cantly more Blines on LUS at H0 and H12 than the patients in the MSI group (P<0.05) and the positive detection (>5 Blines) rate of Blines was higher in the RVAI group than in the MSI group (24.1 vs. 5.2% at H0, 17.2 vs. 3.4% at H12). These results have not been previously investigated in the left lung and the number of Blines was not different between groups at H24 and H36 (P>0.05; Fig. 2 and Table II). Patients in both groups exhibited almost the same BIS scores after each 4h interval (P>0.05; Table III) and FLACC scores at H8 and H12 (P>0.05; Table III).

Discussion
In recent years, a minimally invasive cardiac surgery technique (26) has been increasingly explored to avoid midsternotomy scars and deformities and has achieved favorable cosmetic results and excellent repairs. RVAI is an emerging strategy for treating congenital heart disease that uses techniques that aim to minimize incisions and has led to the combination of reliable functional and cosmetic results (7,8). In the present study, 116 patients with VSDs were enrolled between June 2017 and December 2018. MSI and RVAI were compared for their ability to close VSDs and the effects were evaluated intraoperatively and postoperatively.
Various studies have reported on the feasibility of performing the right axillary incision procedure to repair CHDs (3,7). Dave et al (7) reported that right axillary inci sion may be used to repair various congenital defects with a quality similar to that of standard surgical approaches while obtaining a superior cosmetic result compared to conventional incisions. Yan et al (3) also investigated whether RVAI was a safe procedure and determined that RVAI may be performed with excellent cosmetic and clinical outcomes. Similarly, in the present study, no difference in the number of transfusions was identified between the groups, and the MSI group had similar cardiopulmonary bypass and crossclamp times. Cosmetic results are important for patients who undergo surgery to close simple CHDs, and the short incision length and location of the RVAI, the remaining scar of which is hidden by the resting arm, results in satisfactory cosmetic effects (3). Furthermore, the RVAI group had less drainage from the incision than the MSI group; this result may be attributed to the sternum not having been split, which results in less bleeding. Pectus deformities have been reported after standard MSI surgeries to treat CHDs (14). In the present study, no thorax asymmetry was detected in the RVAI group 6 months after operation.
In recent decades, ultrasound has become an important method for diagnostic examinations and monitoring of lung diseases; ultrasound has become an emerging diagnostic tool for diagnosing extravascular lung water with high sensitivity and specificity (15,16). The Blines of ultrasound images are signs of interstitial inflammation and congestion, which is critically important information in various common clinical situations (17,18). In the present study, Blines were applied to nonradioactively and conveniently evaluate lung impairment in the patients after surgery. Of note, in the right lung, patients in the RVAI group exhibited significantly more Blines on LUS at H0 and H12 than those in the MSI group, but the results did not differ in the left lung. The number of Blines was not different between the two groups at H24 and H36. These results indicated that the RVAI procedure may induce congestion or inflammatory reactions in the right lung within 12 h after the operation. However, all patients were extubated within 8 h after the operation and no pneumonia was diagnosed (data not shown). The present results implied that transient lung impairment from RVAI does not affect patient prognosis and all patients recovered rapidly within 24 h.
The BIS score is objective and credible for the evaluation of analgosedation (12). In the present study, the level of postoperative pain was assessed with the BIS and FLACC scores to evaluate whether the RVAI procedure irritated the intercostal nerves

and induced a higher intensity pain than the MSI procedure. A previous study reported that the minimally invasive proce dure may cause intense pain (visual analog scale, 6.3) during the first three days after the operation (9). In the present study, the patients in the two groups had almost the same BIS score postoperatively after each 4h interval. Furthermore, the FLACC scores after being weaned off ventilation were not significantly different between the RVAI group and the MSI control group. All of these results suggested that the RVAI procedure did not irritate the intercostal nerves to cause intense pain.
In conclusion, the RVAI procedure represents a safe alternative for fixing VSDs and leads to satisfactory cosmetic results; no thorax asymmetry was observed. Furthermore, the transient lung impairment of RVAI was rapidly recovered within 24 h and all patients were extubated within 8 h after the operation. The incision did not interfere with postoperative sedation and pain. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first comprehensive evaluation of RVAI to repair VSDs, reporting on the demographics and clinical outcomes of patients and investigating postoperative lung functions and postoperative pain. However, as it was only a singlecenter study, it the present results require to be confirmed by expanding the sample and performing multicenter trials.

Summary Prompt antibiotic treatment for infants with sepsis has the potential to save lives. A rectal formulation of an antibiotic could be used at a village level before referral to hospital. The development of such a preparation needs to take into account the rectal pH of infants that will affect drug partitioning and absorption. Rectal pH measurements were taken in 100 well and 45 unwell infants. We also measured rectal pH in 14 infants sequentially over the course of their illness. The mean rectal pH was 6.75 with no significant difference in well or unwell infants. The mean (95% CI) rectal pH of well neonates was significantly lower than that of older infants (>28 days): 6.47 (6.29-6.65) vs. 6.90 (6.68 to 7.12) p  0.003.

Background
Each year 10 million children <5 years of age die, the majority from infectious diseases [1, 2]. Many deaths could be prevented if appropriate treatment, such as a broad spectrum antibiotic, could be administered early on in the course of the illness. Children in the developing world are at most risk because of poor healthcare systems and distance from facilities able to provide medical care [3]. Many infants, and in particular neonates, die at home before medical care can be given. Community-based health care workers have been shown to be effective at teaching mothers to recognize unwell infants and those in need of treatment [4]. However, availability and technical expertise to initiate treatment such as parental antibiotics is often impossible to introduce and maintain at a village level. A large multicentre study looking at pre-referral malaria treatment showed that a rectal

suppository of artesunate given at the time of referral significantly reduced death and disability in patients who lived hours away from the nearest health facility [5]. If a rectal formulation of a broad spectrum antibiotic could be developed, it could be deployed in the community and would have the potential to reduce early deaths in infants from sepsis. In order to develop such a preparation that would rely critically on rectal absorption, the milieu of the rectum and in particular the pH must be known. There is very little information on the rectal pH of adults and children in the literature. A German study described the rectal pH in 100 well children undergoing elective surgery: children up to the age of 14 years were examined but no neonates were included. The paper reported a mean pH of 9.6 with a surprisingly wide range of results (7.2-12.1) [6]. Previously, Bitterman et al. studied the rectal pH in humans and dogs: they determined that the mean pH was 7.9 (SD 0.07) in 121 healthy adults [7].
The aims of the current study were to determine the rectal pH of well and unwell infants from birth up to 1 year of age.

Concurrently, infants (0-365 days) who were unwell and required admission had sequential rectal pH measurements taken (at the same time as a rectal temperature was taken) over the course of their illness.
The pH was taken using a Beckman Coulter pHI 410 handheld pH/mV meter with a calomel-pHree sealed glass probe. For measurement, the nonlubricated probe was inserted 2 cm into the rectum and kept in situ until a stable pH reading was obtained. The probe was cleaned with 70% isopropanol between measurements and was calibrated on a daily basis.
Student's t-test was used to compare mean pH values between the groups. The Wilcoxon Signedrank test was used to compare longitudinal changes in pH within an individual.
Results
For the cross sectional survey rectal pH measurements were taken from 145 infants. The median age
312

of the infants was 83 days (range 0-366 days) and 59% were male. The mean rectal pH was 6.75 (95% CI 6.63-6.87). The pH was not significantly different between well and unwell infants: the mean pH in the 100 well infants was 6.69 (95% CI 6.55-6.83) and in the 45 unwell infants 6.88 (95% CI 6.64-7.12) (p  0.15). However, rectal pH was significantly lower in Infants 28 days compared with those >28 days (Table 1).
Fourteen infants who were admitted to the in-patient department had sequential rectal pH measurements taken during their hospital stay (Fig. 1). There was no significant change in rectal pH from hour 0 (admission) to hour 12, 24 and 36 within the individuals (p  0.11, 0.92 and 0.81, respectively).
Conclusions
We showed that the mean intrarectal pH in infants was 6.75 and that this did not change significantly during an illness episode. The intrarectal pH was significantly lower in neonates compared with older infants. We found a similar mean rectal pH to that described previously in healthy adults despite obvious differences in diet [7]. There has been only one previous study looking at the rectal pH of children and infants. In this study, the investigators studied well infants and children and did not include neonates [6]. There were methodological differences

BRIEF REPORT
between the studies which may account for the difference in results. In our study infants were not under anaesthesia and a digital exam was not performed prior to the pH measurement, both of which may alter the normal pH of the rectum, and may explain the much lower variance in recorded values in the present study. An example of the relevance of our findings is that artesunate has been shown to be unstable in acidic conditions [8]. Reassuringly none of the study infants were found to have a low intrarectal pH, supporting the use of rectal artesunate formulations in infancy.
These results will assist in the development of rectally formulated drugs for pre-referral use in resource-limited settings.

The human cognitive system is equipped with various processes for dealing with everyday challenges. One of such processes is the inhibition of currently irrelevant goals or mental task-sets, which can be seen as a response to the critical event of information overflow in the cognitive system and challenging the cognitive system's ability to keep track of ongoing demands. In two experiments, we investigate the flexibility of the inhibitory process by inserting rare non-critical events (25% of all trials), operationalized as univalent stimuli (i.e., unambiguous stimuli that call for only one specific task in a multitasking context), and by introducing the possibility to prepare for an upcoming task (Experiment 2). We found that the inhibitory process is not influenced by a cue informing subjects about the upcoming occurrence of a univalent stimulus. However, the introduction of univalent stimuli allowed preparatory processes to modify the impact of the inhibitory process.Therefore, our results suggest that inhibitory processes are engaged in a rather global manner, not taking into account variations in stimulus valence, which we took as operationalization of critical, conflict-inducing events in the ongoing stream of information processing. However, rare uncritical events, such as univalent stimuli that do not cause conflict and interference in the processing stream, appear to alter the way the cognitive system can take advantage of preparatory processes.
Keywords: cognitive control, multitasking, interference

INTRODUCTION Researchers in cognitive psychology usually refer to task activation and task inhibition processes when trying to explain human behavior in everyday life. Cognitive representations of tasks (i.e., tasksets; e.g., Rogers and Monsell, 1995; Monsell, 1996) are thought to comprise all elements of a task, such as the to be encountered stimuli, the required responses, and the cues used to indicate which task is the relevant one in the current trial. When investigating the application of these task-sets, cognitive psychologists assume that task-sets are activated and implemented in the cognitive system to guarantee the successful achievement of goals, such as writing an article or phoning a friend (see, e.g., Miller and Cohen, 2001). However, even though goal-directed behavior is successful in many situations, people also encounter situations in which the successful pursuit of the goal at hand becomes difficult and they fail.
One classical, widely studied critical situation is multitasking, where people are asked to switch rapidly from one task to another, such as keeping an eye on the children in the living room while preparing lunch for them. Furthermore, although activation of currently relevant task-sets is a powerful mechanism, competition among several activated task-sets causes interference and hampers the successful implementation of the currently appropriate taskset. This interference between task-sets has been suggested to be causal for the observed performance costs when there is a switch of task (i.e., a sequence like AB, where A and B denote to different tasks) compared to a task repetition (i.e., AA). These switch costs have been observed numerous times in task switching studies (see, e.g., Kiesel et al., 2010, for a review).

In task switching, interference among task-sets is thought to arise because of shared stimuli and responses which activate associated task-sets in a bottom-up manner, for instance when subjects are asked to judge a digit based on its magnitude (i.e., smaller vs. larger than five) or parity (i.e., odd vs. even, see, e.g., Koch and Allport, 2006). The notion of competition and interference among task-sets has fostered the proposal of inhibitory mechanisms that reduce the activation of a competing task-set and therefore help the selection of the now appropriate task-set and reduce interference (see, e.g., Monsell, 2003). The present study is aimed at examining inhibitory processes in task switching.
An empirical marker of inhibitory processes in the selection among various task-sets are the so-called n-2 task repetition costs (Mayr and Keele, 2000; see Koch et al., 2010, for a review). These costs are calculated as the performance difference between n-2 task switches (i.e., sequences such as CBA) and n-2 repetitions (sequences such as ABA). An account that assumes activation only would predict that switching back to a task that was recently (i.e., two trials earlier) performed would facilitate performance due to repetition priming (i.e., residual activation) and thus decrease reaction time (RTs). In contrast, an inhibition account predicts exactly the opposite, namely that after having performed task A, subjects have to inhibit the task to successfully switch to task B. When encountering task A again, its activation is still reduced below baseline, so that activating task A again (and thereby overcoming residual inhibition) takes longer and increases RTs relative to the n-2 non-repetition control condition (e.g., Mayr and Keele, 2000; Gade and Koch, 2007). This is exactly what has been found in

Inhibitory processes in critical situations

many studies (see Koch et al., 2010, for a review), establishing n-2 task repetition costs as a valid marker for inhibitory mechanisms in the performance of task sequences.
One question that has arisen shortly after the discovery of n-2 repetition costs was related to the conditions that trigger inhibitory mechanisms in multitasking. Studies aiming at the identification of the triggering conditions of n-2 repetition costs investigated response-related factors such as response selection or execution (for example Schuch and Koch, 2003; Gade and Koch, 2007; Philipp et al., 2007a; Schneider and Verbruggen, 2008), while other studies identified cue-related factors (Houghton et al., 2009; Grange and Houghton, 2011) or stimulus-related factors (Arbuthnott, 2008; Sdoia and Ferlazzo, 2008) that gave rise to n-2 repetition costs. Furthermore, n-2 repetition costs were found to be largely insensitive to variations in preparation time (Mayr and Keele, 2000; Schuch and Koch, 2003; Gade and Koch, 2008), suggesting that engaging in active cognitive preparation of a task-set does not usually help to overcome the residual inhibition (but see Grange and Houghton, 2011). Moreover, n-2 task repetition costs were found even though subjects knew that they will have to perform the just inhibited task again (Mayr and Keele, 2000; Koch et al., 2006). To conclude, inhibition of competing tasks, which can be measured as n-2 task repetition costs, is a powerful means of the cognitive system to deal with critical situations of task conflict, that is, situations involving several active task-sets and the need to select one of them to successfully to meet the situational requirements. However, the triggering conditions are not yet fully understood.
In fact, although being reliably obtained, the size of n-2 task repetition costs varied widely across studies. This may suggest that the amount of inhibition (as reflected in the size of n-2 repetition costs) is tied to the amount of conflict experienced in the trial before the current trial (i.e., trial n-1). In line with this suggestion, Gade and Koch (2005) found that the size of n-2 repetition costs was linked to the time elapsed between the response in the preceding trial and the next cue (the response-cue interval). They observed a decrease in n-2 repetition costs with increasing RCI and attributed it to decay of residual task activation, which then produces less competing activation of the recently abandoned task (Gade and Koch, 2005; see Horoufchin et al., 2011, for a discussion of the issue of RCI effects in task switching). Next to decreased task activation, also the dominance of a task has been found to influence the size of n-2 repetition costs. Using a speech production paradigm requiring the naming of visually presented digits, Philipp et al. (2007b) asked their subjects to switch among three languages and found significantly larger n-2 repetition costs for the more dominant language (L1; i.e., German, for German subjects) compared to the other languages assessed in the experiment (see also Arbuthnott, 2008, for a related finding). Furthermore, Grange and Houghton (2010) could show that an increase in intertrial-conflict by the change in cue-task mapping increased n-2 repetition costs. Finally, Philipp and Koch (2006) observed that the introduction of immediate (i.e., n-1) task repetitions lead to reduced n-2 repetition costs. They interpreted their finding according to a balance between activation and inhibition processes ensuring the optimal equilibrium of activation and inhibition in the cognitive system (Philipp and Koch, 2006).

To summarize this brief review, there is evidence that the size of n-2 repetition costs is related to the amount of processing conflict among tasks. For this article, which is about the notion of criticality in living systems, we take the concept of conflict as equivalent to the idea of a critical event, and cognitive conflicts can be suitably explored in multitasking situations, such as in task switching. Therefore, we take changes in processing demands that reduce conflict among tasks (and consequently the size of n-2 repetition costs) as those variables that reduce criticality of the ongoing processing demands. Thus, we use an operational definition of critical events by means of conflict among tasks.
In the present study, we set out to investigate whether inhibitory mechanisms leading to n-2 repetition costs are influenced by stimulus valence. Previous task switching research has shown that stimulus valence is a powerful trigger of conflict among tasks (see Kiesel et al., 2010). We were specifically interested in whether a univalent stimulus modulates the size of n-2 repetition cost. Univalent stimuli are stimuli that call only for one task and thus do not afford task conflict. Stimulus valence (i.e., multivalent vs. univalent) has been rarely assessed when investigating the triggering conditions of task inhibition.
In one of the rare studies, Sdoia and Ferlazzo (2008) had subjects perform three tasks (two numerical judgment tasks and one perceptual color matching short-term memory task) on either univalent or trivalent stimuli (i.e., colored digits, the stimulus material for the numerical judgment tasks). Sdoia and Ferlazzo (2008) found n-2 repetition costs only for trivalent stimuli, while there were no n-2 repetition costs for univalent stimuli (i.e., colored patches). They concluded that overlap on the level of the stimuli could also give rise to n-2 repetition costs. However, please note that in this study, the color matching task (i.e., same or different) was a purely perceptual task and therefore differed from the two numerical judgment tasks in terms of difficulty and memory engagement. This difference in tasks might account for the failure of finding n-2 repetition costs with univalent stimuli in the first place. In a different study, Gade and Koch (2007) were primarily interested in investigating the role of response set overlap (i.e., response valence), but they also used univalent stimuli in 25% of trials. However, like in Sdoia and Ferlazzo's (2008) study, univalent stimuli where confounded with task identity and this specific task also had a different response set. That is, in both Sdoia and Ferlazzo's (2008) study and Gade and Koch's (2007) study, the data on the role of stimulus valence and its relation to n-2 task repetition costs were associated with a confound of task identity with stimulus valence, rendering clear conclusions difficult.
The present study was aimed to systematically examine the role of stimulus valence in task inhibition deconfounded with task identity or response set differences. In Experiment 1, we introduced 25% univalent trials, independent of task identity. That is, any of the three tasks was either performed on a trivalent stimulus (i.e., a stimulus consisting of members of all three stimulus sets, see Figure 1) or on a univalent stimulus that afforded only one task. If stimulus valence leads to less conflict among tasks, then we should see reduced n-2 repetition costs after a univalent stimulus in trial n-1 because univalent stimuli should not call for inhibitory processes to reduce task-set conflict. This assumption is based on the finding that univalent stimuli in two-tasks paradigms

were colored rectangles surrounding the stimulus display. A blue rectangle indicated the letter task, a green rectangle the digit task, and a yellow one the symbol task. These cues are further referred to as task-specific cues. However, in one fourth of the trials, subjects were presented with a red rectangle, merely indicating a task switch without informing about the task identity in the next trial. This cue is referred to as task-unspecific cue, and the subsequent stimulus display consisted of two diamonds and one stimulus being associated with one of the three tasks (see Figure 1). Because of practical reasons, one half of the subjects used the ALT and ALT GR keys of a German computer keyboard for responding, and the other half of subjects responded on an external keyboard by pressing one of the two horizontally aligned keys with the index finger of the right and left hand. External response keys measured approximately 1.7 cm and were spatially separated by 3.2 cm. Testing took place in a dimly lit room. Viewing distance was about 50 cm.

lead to less switch costs and shorter RTs, indicating facilitated processing (e.g., Meiran, 2008; Braverman and Meiran, 2010) and that bivalency of stimuli incurs a cost (Woodward et al., 2003).
However, to make sure that subjects knew in advance about the less critical, less conflict-inducing events, and thus to further reduce the potential task conflict, each univalent stimulus was indicated by a task-unspecific cue, informing the subject that the next stimulus would be univalent, but not announcing the identity of the upcoming task (which had to be inferred from the univalent stimulus). In all other trials, tasks were indicated by a task-specific cue.
EXPERIMENT 1
METHOD Subjects Thirty-two subjects (18 women, mean age 23.8 years) participated in the experiment and were paid 8 Euro.
Stimuli and tasks Subjects performed a letter judgment (consonant vs. vowel), a digit judgment (odd vs. even), or a symbol judgment (text symbols vs. math symbols), as indicated by a cue. The stimuli were presented in the center of a 15 color monitor connected to an IBM compatible PC. The stimulus display consisted of all three kinds of stimuli that were arranged in a column, so that subjects had to use the cue to decide which task to perform. The stimulus set for the letter task was (A, E, U, D, P, W). Stimuli for the digit task were (2, 4, 6, 3, 5, 7). For the symbol task, stimuli consisted of a set of symbols (!, ', ., +, =, <). Stimulus position varied randomly from trial to trial. Cues

Procedure The experiment was run in a single session with one subject at a time and took about 60 min. Written instructions appeared on the screen, and the experiment was also explained orally. Subjects were informed that they were required to perform three different tasks, depending on the cue surrounding the stimulus display. Subjects were instructed to make use of the cue because most stimulus displays would contain all three kinds of stimuli, requiring the information conveyed by the cue. The S-R mappings were explained for all tasks (with the mappings being counterbalanced across subjects) and a card containing these mappings was placed below the monitor. Subjects performed two practice blocks of 10 and 15 trials to get familiar with the cues and the tasks. In a third practice block, consisting of 25 trials, the task-unspecific cues were introduced. Task-unspecific cues were always followed by univalent stimuli. All three tasks occurred equally often within a block, and so did all possible task triplets. Immediate task repetitions were excluded. The task sequence was pseudo-random due to the constraints described above. The stimulus and response sequence was random with the constraint that each stimulus appeared equally often within one block. Direct stimulus repetition did not occur. The instruction emphasized both speed and accuracy. Subjects received feedback when they committed an error.
A trial started with a blank screen for 500 ms. Then the cue appeared, followed by the stimulus display after 500 ms. Stimuli and cue remained on the screen until the response was given. An experimental block of trials consisted of 75 trials. After each block, subjects received feedback about their mean RT and were invited to take a small break before starting with the next block. Altogether, subjects performed nine experimental blocks followed by a post-experimental interview.
Design To assess whether our manipulation of stimulus valence had the expected impact we compared performance in trial n for univalent and trivalent stimuli. Please note that according to the retroactive nature of task inhibition (Koch et al., 2010), our main analysis focuses on stimulus valence in trial n-1 and task sequence, leading to the two independent variables task sequence (n-2 repetition vs. n-2 switch) and stimulus valence in trial n-1 (univalent vs.

trivalent). To accomplish this analysis, we constructed the triplets relevant for data analysis in such a way that both the task in trial n-2 and the task in trial n were performed on trivalent stimuli, whereas univalent stimuli were only allowed to occur in trial n-1. In each block, univalent stimuli, indicated by a task-unspecific cue, were randomly interspersed in one-fourth of the trials. Immediate repetition of trials with univalent stimuli was possible, but these trials were excluded from analysis. The dependent variables were RT and error rate.
RESULTS Only correct trials that were preceded by at least two correct trials were included in the data analysis. We standardized RTs for each subject separately and regarded RTs larger than z = 3 as outliers (1.6% of otherwise correct trials). The data from one subject were excluded because of an error rate over 15%; however, the overall data pattern did not change when including these data in the analysis.
To make sure that our manipulation of stimulus valence had the expected effect, we examined the effect of stimulus valence (univalent vs. trivalent) in trial n using a paired t -test. Subjects performed 127 ms faster on univalent stimuli compared to trivalent stimuli [1581 ms vs. 1709 ms, t (30) = 5.0, p < 0.05], indicating that our manipulation of stimulus valence was successful. The mean error rate for subjects was 1.5% for univalent trials, whereas it was 4.9% for trivalent trials [t (30) = 10.64, p < 0.05], further corroborating the idea that univalent stimuli induced less processing conflict in the current trial. Based on this empirically established effect of stimulus valence, we now turn to the analysis of the influence of stimulus valence as a triggering condition for task inhibition; that is, we examine performance as a function of stimulus valence in the preceding trial (trial n-1) to see whether it affects the degree of inhibition that we can measure (as an after-effect) as n-2 task repetition costs. RT and percentage error as a function of stimulus valence in trial n-1 and task sequence is shown in Table 1.
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) on RT using stimulus valence in trial n-1 (trivalent vs. univalent) and task sequence (n-2 repetition vs. n-2 switch) as independent variables revealed a main effect of stimulus valence in trial n-1, F (1, 30) = 40.62, p < 0.05, p2 = 0.58. RT was higher after a trial with a univalent stimulus than after a trial with a trivalent stimulus (1906 vs. 1839 ms),

which is probably due to the change from the univalent stimulus display back to the multivalent display (see also Gade and Koch, 2007). Importantly, we also obtained a significant main effect of task sequence, F (1, 30) = 12.97, p < 0.05, p2 = 0.30, indicating overall n-2 task repetition costs of 56 ms. However, contrary to the expectation based on the idea that univalent stimuli do not call for inhibitory processes to resolve task-set conflict (or do so much less), these n-2 task repetition costs were not at all larger after a trivalent stimuli than after a univalent stimulus but even numerically smaller (45 vs. 67 ms), but this difference was clearly non-significant (F < 1).
The overall error rate was 6.1% (see Table 1). There was no main effect of stimulus valence in trial n-1 or of task sequence (both F s < 1.8, both ps > 0.20, p2 < 0.1). Also the interaction effect was non-significant, F (1, 30) = 3.7, p > 0.06, p2 = 0.11, even though there was in fact a numerical trend toward larger n-2 repetition costs after trivalent stimuli than after univalent stimuli. Note, however, that the absolute number of errors after the univalent stimulus was very small (as was the number of errors for univalent trials in general because these trials were infrequent relative to those trials following a trivalent cue, so that these error data are more variable, rendering the interpretation of error rates in this condition rather inconclusive.
DISCUSSION In Experiment 1, we found n-2 repetition costs both for trials after a univalent stimulus and trials after a trivalent stimulus. These costs did not differ as a function of stimulus valence, although our manipulation showed reduced RT and error rates for univalent stimuli in the current trial, so that we have empirical evidence for the clear effect of our experimental variation of stimulus valence.
However, one way to account for this lack of an effect of stimulus valence in the preceding trial might be that subjects have adopted a strategy to inhibit the just performed task when the task-unspecific cue came up. Therefore it is difficult to isolate the effect of stimulus valence from cue type (specific vs. unspecific). Experiment 2 allowed us to examine more directly the influence of stimulus valence by disentangling the variation of stimulus valence from the additional introduction of an attention-grabbing task-unspecific cue as used in Experiment 1.
In Experiment 2, we used task-specific cues only and still introduced 25% univalent stimuli randomly in the task sequence. In addition, to assess the degree to which subjects used the taskspecific cues, we varied the cue-target interval (CTI). Previous task switching studies have demonstrated that both RT level generally and switch costs particularly are decreased with a long CTI, suggesting a process of active task preparation (see Kiesel et al., 2010, for a review). Hence, in Experiment 2 we could establish empirically whether subjects actively process the cue prior to stimulus onset.
EXPERIMENT 2
METHOD Subjects Twenty-four new subjects participated either for course credit or the payment of 15 CHF. Subjects had a mean age of 23.7 years and 21 of them were female.

Inhibitory processes in critical situations

Stimuli, tasks, and procedure Stimuli, tasks, and procedure were the same as in Experiment 1, but we omitted the task-unspecific cues. Moreover, to make sure that subjects used the task-specific cues we introduced a CTI manipulation. Subjects performed blocks with long (i.e., 900 ms) CTI and blocks with short (i.e., 100 ms) CTI in alternating order. CTI order was counterbalanced across subjects. The first block was regarded as practice and was not further analyzed. Subjects performed 12 blocks of 75 trials followed by a post-experimental interview. As in Experiment 1, 25% of trials were performed on univalent stimuli.
Design The independent within-subjects variables were stimulus valence in trial n-1 (trivalent vs. univalent), CTI (100 vs. 900 ms), and task sequence (n-2 repetition vs. n-2 switch). The dependent variables were RT and error rate.
RESULTS Only correct trials that were preceded by at least two correct trials were included in the data analysis. We standardized RTs for each subject separately and regarded RTs larger than z = 3 as outliers (1.6% of otherwise correct trials). RT and percentage error as a function of stimulus in trial n-1, CTI, and task sequence is shown in Table 2.
To establish that our manipulation of stimulus valence had the intended effect of reducing task conflict, we analyzed performance in trial n depending on stimulus valence. Subjects were 285 ms faster when the current stimulus was univalent compared to a trivalent stimulus [1082 vs. 1367 ms, t (23) = 8.78, p < 0.05], so again the introduction of univalent stimuli led to faster performance. Accuracy was not affected by stimulus valence (0.6% for both types of trials).
An ANOVA on RT using stimulus valence in trial n-1 (univalent vs. trivalent), CTI (100 vs. 900 ms), and task sequence (n-2 repetition vs. n-2 switch) as within-subjects variables revealed a main effect of task sequence, F (1, 23) = 10.66, p < 0.05, p2 = 0.31, indicating overall n-2 repetition costs of 64 ms. Stimulus valence in trial n-1 lead to a main effect [F (1, 23) = 12.45, p2 = 35.1], indicating that subjects were, like in Experiment 1,

slower after a univalent stimulus in trial n-1 (1337 vs. 1413 ms, for trivalent and univalent stimuli in trial n-1, respectively). CTI also yielded a main effect, F (1, 23) = 304.30, p < 0.05, p2 = 0.93, suggesting that subjects engaged in preparation for the upcoming task although this might turn out to be a trial with a univalent stimulus, in which case cue processing is not required because the stimulus affords only one task. Importantly, like in Experiment 1, the interaction of stimulus valence and task sequence was not significant (F < 1). n-2 Repetition costs were 50 ms after trivalent stimuli in trial n-1 [t (23) = 3.9, p < 0.05] and 83 ms after univalent stimuli in trial n-1 [t (23) = 3.9, p < 0.05]. Interestingly, the interaction of task sequence and CTI was significant, F (1, 23) = 7.19, p < 0.05, p2 = 0.24, indicating a reduction of n-2 repetition cost with long CTI (104 vs. 24 ms, for short vs. long CTI, respectively). The residual n-2 task repetition costs of 24 ms were no longer significant [t (23) = 0.90, p > 0.30]. This preparatory reduction of the inhibition effect occurred regardless of stimulus valence, that is, neither the three-way interaction nor any other interaction was significant (all F s < 1, see Figure 2).
The overall error rate was 3.6% (see Table 2). Only stimulus valence in trial n-1 yielded a significant main effect [F (1, 23) = 12.96, p < 0.05, p2 = 0.36], indicating more errors after a trivalent stimulus (4%) than after a univalent stimulus (2.7%). (Note that this effect indicates a speed-accuracy tradeoff because RTs were actually significantly shorter after a trivalent stimulus than after a univalent stimulus.) No other significant results were obtained (all ps > 0.15).
DISCUSSION In Experiment 2, we used only task-specific cues. Our manipulation of stimulus valence showed the intended effect in trial n, so that performance was faster with univalent stimuli, suggesting reduced task conflict (see Braverman and Meiran, 2010, for related results). Importantly, we found n-2 task repetition costs regardless of stimulus valence in the preceding trial (i.e., n-1); again, like in Experiment 1 these were descriptively even somewhat larger after a univalent stimulus. The results of Experiment 2 thus closely replicate those of Experiment 1, suggesting that

Inhibitory processes in critical situations

FIGURE 2 | n-2 Repetition cost as a function of stimulus valence in trial n-1 and CTI for Experiment 2. Error bars denote 95% within-subject confidence intervals.
the finding of similar task inhibition effects after univalent and trivalent stimuli in Experiment 1 was not due to some strategic adaptation based on the task-unspecific warning cues.
Note that the substantial effect of the CTI suggests that subjects actively prepared the upcoming task based on the cues regardless of the fact that the stimulus could have been univalent. However, we also found that prolonged preparation time reduced the n-2 task repetition costs, rendering these costs non-significant with long CTI. The issue of why the introduction of univalent stimuli apparently favored an influence of cue-based preparation on n-2 task repetition costs is discussed in the Section "General Discussion."
GENERAL DISCUSSION The present study was aimed to examine the degree of processing conflict as a triggering condition for task inhibition in multitasking situations requiring rapid task switching. To this end, we examined the influence of stimulus valence in the preceding trial on the occurrence of n-2 task repetition costs in two experiments. In Experiment 1, we could show that presenting a task-unspecific warning cue followed by a univalent stimulus in trial n-1 did not abolish n-2 repetition costs measured in trial n. In Experiment 2, we examined the impact of univalent stimuli more directly and could rule out that the task-unspecific warning cue, used in Experiment 1, gave rise to the pattern of comparable n-2 repetition costs regardless of stimulus valence in the preceding trial. To summarize our results, the random insertion of 25% of univalent stimuli did not abolish n-2 repetition costs, neither when they occurred with a warning cue nor when they occurred completely unpredictably.
The experimental variation of stimulus valence was based on the notion that task conflict should be small when being faced with univalent stimuli, because such stimuli afford only one task (Woodward et al., 2003). Empirically we could establish this expected effect of stimulus valence. Hence, if the level of conflict in the current trial determines the strength of inhibition of the most competing task (which is usually the immediately preceding, just performed task) that we can measure as n-2 repetition costs, then we should have observed reduced n-2 repetition costs after univalent stimuli as did Sdoia and Ferlazzo (2008). However, this was clearly not the case in two experiments. Both experiments had

reasonable statistical power, but the data trend actually at least numerically even opposed our prediction in both experiments. Please note that our study differed from the study of Sdoia and Ferlazzo (2008) and the work of Gade and Koch (2007) in that we did not assign a specific task to univalent stimuli or a specific, different response set, which might provide alternative explanations for the finding obtained by Sdoia and Ferlazzo (2008). In another way, the data therefore support the conclusion drawn by Gade and Koch (2007) in their third experiment, namely critical and a triggering condition for task inhibition is indeed the overlap in response set.
This finding suggests that task inhibition is a powerful means of the cognitive system to deal with critical events, such as conflict among, but it seems to be a very inflexible mechanism that does not respond to the level of conflict induced by the stimulus. Hence, even though we could demonstrate empirically that univalent stimuli lead to less task conflict, it appears that the task conflict that still remains based on overlap of the response sets across tasks (Gade and Koch, 2007) is sufficient to trigger the n-2 task repetition costs in full size, unmodulated by the variation of stimulus valence.
However, univalent stimuli, although not directly influencing the size of n-2 repetition costs, might none the less have altered performance of the ongoing task sequence by indirect means (for instance by a change in task-set shielding; Dreisbach and Wenke, 2011). We found increased RTs after a univalent trial in both experiments, which suggests that the exposition to a univalent stimulus interrupted the routines subjects had developed for solving the task requirements (see Lien et al., 2006, for a related finding in a two-task paradigm). Therefore, although on its own univalent trials might be experienced as easier than multivalent trials, the data suggest that variations in stimulus valence apparently lead to changes in the way people process the encountered tasks.
Adaptation to current processing demands is widely documented in the task switching literature, for example by the impact of stimulus congruency (that is whether or not the two dimensions of a bivalent stimulus afford the same response or different responses) on task switch costs (Goschke, 2000), or vice versa by the influence of switching demands on congruency of otherwise irrelevant stimulus features (Dreisbach and Wenke, 2011). In this context, it is an important finding that in Experiment 2, we found that prolonged preparation time decreased n-2 task repetition costs, which seems to be an adaptive effect, too.
This preparatory reduction of n-2 task repetition costs is a somewhat atypical finding, as the majority of previous studies observed that long preparation time does not significantly reduce the size of n-2 repetition costs (e.g., Mayr and Keele, 2000; Schuch and Koch, 2003; Gade and Koch, 2008; see Grange and Houghton, 2011, for discussion). Yet, two other studies found a similar reduction of n-2 repetition costs with prolonged preparation time. In one study, Philipp et al., 2007b, Experiment 2) assessed n-2 repetition costs when switching among languages, and in a second study Koch et al. (2004) assessed n-2 repetition costs in switching of response mode. It should be noted that these two studies, like the present study, had experimental features that distinguished them from the standard paradigm.

Inhibitory processes in critical situations

That is, there was a clear dominance relationship among languages in the study by Philipp et al. (2007b), there were two choice-response tasks but one simple-response task in the study by Koch et al. (2004), and there were 25% univalent stimuli in the present study. Please note that preparation time benefits were not solely observed for the altered tasks but were found to affect all three tasks in our present study, as it was in the study of Koch et al. (2004) and of Philipp et al. (2007b).
We think it is likely that the introduction of univalent trials, which fostered adaptations such as a refocusing of attention after a univalent trial (Meiran, 2008), might have also altered the way prolonged preparation time influences the n-2 repetition costs, by rendering variations in preparation time more salient. While we assume that usually n-2 repetition costs are insensitive to prolonged preparation time (Schuch and Koch, 2003, for a more detailed argument), having to adapt to infrequent changes in

stimulus valence like in this study, or to different response effectors (Koch et al., 2004), or to strong dominance hierarchies (Philipp et al., 2007b) might encourage subjects to use prolonged preparation time more efficiently (Gade and Koch, 2008; see Grange and Houghton, 2011, for a similar argument). Further research will have to examine the underlying mechanism of this particular preparatory phenomenon in more detail.
In sum, our data suggest the means, for example the inhibition of the last performed task, by which the cognitive system deals with critical events are used in a rather global fashion (i.e., for all trials in a complete block or even experiment) and therefore are inflexible to adapt to rare non-critical events.

ABSTRACT
We present a new version of the European Bioinformatics Institute Web Services, a complete suite of SOAP-based web tools for structural and functional analysis, with new and improved applications. New functionality has been added to most of the services already available, and an improved version of the underlying framework has allowed us to include more applications. Information on the EBI Web Services, tutorials and clients can be found at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/ webservices.
INTRODUCTION
Web Services technology enables scientists to access EBI data and analysis applications as if they were installed on their laboratory computers. Similarly, it enables programmers to build complex applications without the need to install and maintain the databases and analysis tools and without having to take on the financial overheads that accompany these. Moreover, Web Services provide easier integration and interoperability between bioinformatics applications and the data they require.
All that is needed by the user is a lightweight program that communicates with the servers running at the EBI. These services have several advantages: they provide an easy and flexible way to deal with repetitive tasks such as bulk submission with minimal intervention from the user, and allow the programmer as well as the service provider to integrate and build more complex analysis workflows using existing EBI services.
MOTIVATION
The challenge of unravelling gene function and better understand gene regulation processes in an era where exponentially growing amounts of genomic data are being deposited into the public databases, requires fast and

unlimited access to tools that can, in a systematic manner, simplify the analysis of these data.
Equally important, scientists are no longer bound to work within the confinement of their own labs. The Internet has provided the means to develop systems with which it is possible to exchange results and partial analysis of data. Characterizing a gene in terms of a sequence, its translation, expression profile, function and structure requires access to widely distributed services. The integration of such services and their interoperability is now feasible using Web Services technologies.
These data and the corresponding analysis tools are mainly accessed using browser-based interfaces. When large amounts of data need to be retrieved and analysed, this often proves to be tedious and impractical. Moreover, research is rarely completed just by retrieving or analysing a particular nucleotide or protein sequence. Database information retrieval and analysis services have to be linked, so that, for example, search results from one database can be used as the base of a search in another, the results of which are then analysed. When performing these operations using a web browser, researchers are forced to repeat the troublesome tasks of searching; copying the results for subsequent searches into other database services, and again copying the results from these for further analysis.
Creating a local bioinformatics work environment is possible by downloading and installing the necessary database content and services (such as retrieval and analysis programs). This has the advantage that processes that otherwise require manual operations can be automated. However, the hidden overheads imposed by maintaining and operating such environments are, more often than not, exceed the capacity of local systems.
Programmatic Web Services technology has gained much attention as an open architecture enabling interoperability among applications across heterogeneous platforms and different networks. The European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) has been using this technology (1) to enhance and ease the use of the bioinformatics resources it provides (2). Currently, the

European Bioinformatics Institute provides access to more than 200 databases and to about 150 bioinformatics applications.
METHODS
To ensure software from various sources work well together, this technology is built on open standards such as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP, http:// www.w3.org/TR/soap/), a messaging protocol for transporting information; (WSDL, http://www.w3.org/TR/ wsdl), a standard method of describing Web Services and their capabilities, and Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI, http://www.uddi.org/ specification.html), a platform-independent, XML-based registry for services. For the transport layer itself, Web Services can use most of the commonly available network protocols, especially Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
EBI Web Services are described by WSDL files. WSDL is an XML format for describing network services as a set of endpoints operating on messages containing either document-oriented or procedure-oriented information. The functionality provided by the service and the messages exchanged are described in an abstract manner.
A WSDL binding describes how the service is bound to a messaging protocol, particularly the SOAP messaging protocol. A WSDL SOAP binding can be either a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) style binding or a document-style binding. A SOAP binding can also have an encoded use or a literal use. We are using rpc/encoded style currently, and will be providing document/literal style soon following recommendations from the Web Services Interoperability Organization (WS-I, http://www.ws-i.org) guidelines. For a detailed explanation of the differences between both styles, see http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/ webservices/library/ws-whichwsdl/.
A client (program) connecting to a Web Service can read the WSDL to determine what functions are available on the server. Any special data types used are embedded in the WSDL file in the form of an XML Schema. The client can then use SOAP to actually call one of the functions listed in the WSDL. Most SOAP frameworks and toolkits provide methods for the automatic generation of client code from the WSDL description.
SERVICES DESCRIPTION
Currently, EBI supports SOAP services for both database information retrieval and sequence analysis. Information about these services can be accessed from the web page http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices (Table 1).
Data retrieval
WSDbfetch allows retrieving entries in various common formats from more than 20 biological databases including EMBL (3), UniprotKB (4), Interpro (5), etc. It provides several methods for retrieving information about the service (getAvailableDatabases, getAvailableFormats, getAvailableStyles) and a fetchData operation for the

actual retrieval. The user just needs to provide the database name and database identifier or accession number, and retrieve the entry (or entries) in either ASCII text, HTML with hyperlinks or XML. An example of a simple Ruby (http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) client is presented subsequently (Figure 1).
Similarity search tools
A first step in many analysis procedures is usually to carry out a primary database search in order to identify sequence similarities and several algorithms are available to compare nucleotide or protein queries with nucleotide or protein databases.
Basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) (6) is probably the most popular sequence similarity search program. The EBI provides NCBI BLAST (including PHI-BLAST and PSI-BLAST (7)) and WU-BLAST (http://blast.wustl.edu) servers with a common homepage at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/blast/and a FASTA (8) server at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fasta/. Figure 2 shows an example of Ruby client for WU-Blast.
Apart from Blast and Fasta, EBI provides two proteinspecific search tools. MPsrch (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ MPsrch/) is a biological sequence sequence comparison tool that implements the true Smith and Waterman algorithm (9). It allows a rigorous search in a reasonable computational time. SCANPS (Scan Protein Sequence, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/scanps/) is another program for comparing a protein sequence to a database of protein sequences. It also implements the full Smith-Waterman style searching and is capable of identifying multiple domain matches by using iterative profile searching. Both methods are available in our Web Services suite.

InterProScan
InterPro is an integrated resource for protein families, domains and functional sites, which integrates the following protein signature databases: PROSITE, PRINTS, ProDom, Pfam, SMART, TIGRFAMs, PIRSF, SUPERFAMILY, Gene3D and PANTHER (5).
InterProScan (10) is a tool that integrates the search algorithms and protein signature recognition methods from the InterPro member databases into one resource, and provides the corresponding InterPro accession numbers and Gene Ontology (GO) (11) annotation in the results. These GO mappings provide annotation for 61% of UniProtKB proteins, which facilitates GO annotation to query proteins. The current release of InterPro contains more than 13 000 entries, with its signatures covering over 78% of UniProtKB proteins. Figure 3 contains an example Perl (www.perl.org) client for InterProScan.
Multiple and pairwise sequence alignment applications
Over the past years, multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) have become one of the most widely used tools in biology along with database search methods. MSAs are needed for profile analysis, phylogenetic reconstruction, structure prediction and a wealth of minor but important applications such as PCR primer design or sequence reconciliation. The ever-growing reliance on MSAs is even more pronounced now that hundreds of complete genomes are being made available.
CLUSTALW (12) is a widely used program for multiple sequence alignment and is one of the most popular tools at the EBI. T-Coffee (13), MUSCLE (14), MAFFT (15) and Kalign (16), are other tools that employ newer algorithms that complement the accuracy of CLUSTALW.
For pairwise alignment, dynamic programming methods ensure an optimal solution by exploring all possible alignments and choosing the best one. The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) (17), includes the programs `water', a tool implementing the Smith-Waterman for local alignments, and `needle', an implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch (18) algorithm for global alignments.

All these methods are now available as Web Services from the EBI, providing a sensible framework for multiple sequence alignment processing.
Structural analysis
Tools available as Web Services for structural analysis include MaxSprout (19), which is a fast database algorithm for generating protein backbone and side chain co-ordinates from a C(alpha) trace. The backbone is assembled from fragments taken from known structures. Side chain conformations are optimized in rotamer space using a rough potential energy function to avoid clashes. Also, DaliLite (20), which, computes optimal and suboptimal protein structural alignments between two input sets of atomic coordinates.
Text mining
Whatizit (21) is a text processing system that allows you to do text mining tasks on text. The tasks are defined by a series of pipelines. The description of each text processing step can be found in the on line documentation of the tool (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/webservices/whatizit/info.jsf). Optionally, instead of providing the text to be analysed, users can supply a term query. This will result in the retrieval of publicly available (i.e in MEDLINE) abstracts matching the terms in the query and their consequent annotation by the pipeline of your choice.
Whatizit can identify molecular biology terms and link them to publicly available databases. Terms identified by the system are wrapped with XML tags that carry additional information, such as the primary keys to the databases where all the relevant information is kept. This service is highly appreciated by people who are reading literature and need to quickly find more information about the query term, e.g. its Uniprot id, MEDLINE references, UniProt/Swiss-Prot keywords, Gene Ontology (GO) terms and the NCBI Taxonomy.
The Whatizit Web Service is available as a SOAP implementation and as a streamed servlet. The methods available through the SOAP interface are presented in Table 2.

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION
Most of the EBI services presented here are implemented using a common Perl-based framework. These are tightly integrated with EBI hardware and middleware infrastructure and provide a uniform interface to the user. SOAP::Lite 0.60 was selected as the SOAP toolkit as it has proven to be the most stable. Sun's JAXWS RI 2.0 is used for the WSDbfetch and Whatizit implementations. These provide for basic methods: runApp, checkStatus, getResults and poll, which are summarized as follows:
The runApp method (where App is the name of the application, i.e. runFasta, runClustalW etc) is used to submit a job to the EBI job dispatcher. This method accepts two inputs: an InputParams structure with the options to be passed to the application, and a string array with the sequences. The job can be submitted in two modes: synchronous and asynchronous. In both cases, the server returns a job identifier which can be used to retrieve the results (Figure 4). Examples of client programs were shown in Figures 1-3.

COMBINING WEB SERVICES
One of the main advantages of Web Services is that researchers can easily construct bioinformatics workflows and pipelines combining two or more Web Services to solve complex biological tasks such as protein function prediction, genome annotation, microarray analysis, etc. Users can customize any analytical protocol by combining services available from different locations. Services, thus become building blocks that can be exchanged, allowing flexibility and robustness. Workflow protocols can be created as either simple scripts or using graphical workflow tools such as Taverna (22) or Triana (23).
A summary of other Web Services available from the EBI is presented in Table 3. There is also a wide range of Web Services available worldwide, with those provided by the NCBI Entrez Programming Utilities (24), the DNA Databank of Japan (DDBJ) (25) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (26) being the most commonly used in bioinformatics. Additional tools and databases include PathPort/ ToolBus tools (27), BioMOBY (28) BIND (29). A more comprehensive list and description of the services

USAGE
More than 1 600 000 job submissions were processed using Web Services during 2006, accounting for around 30% of all jobs run at the EBI during that period. InterProScan (1 500 000) and Blast (120 000) are the most used services. Additionally, more than two million entries were retrieved through WSDbfetch, which accounts for 35% of all dbfetch type requests. Users involved in high-throughput processing and requiring systematic usage of a particular tool are the main beneficiaries of these services.
Commercial as well as academic bioinformatics service providers, such as ProFunc (34), ELM Server (35), the Uniprot Unified Website, Integr8 or Blast2GO (36) have adopted our services as an integral part of their online services. They are also used by many Open Source projects and commercial tools such as Jalview (37) and BlastStation (http://www.blaststation.com).
FUTURE PLANS
After a careful evaluation of existing technologies, and taking into consideration our users' feedback, we are planning for continuous improvement and re-engineering of implementation of future services. We have chosen JAX-WS (http://java.sun.com/webservices/jaxws/) as a basis for our future Web Services infrastructure. We are confident that this change will allow us to meet the increasing demand and improve the level of service. The JAX-WS technology has reached a sufficient level of maturity and commitment by the developer and user communities, and is architectured for high performance, extension and interoperability. New features, such as WS-Security and WS-RM, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ List_of_Web_service_specifications) will be introduced, ensuring that we will be able to provide advanced functionality and meet future requirements.
We will be also moving to a document/literal style WSDL descriptions following the Web Services Interoperability Organization (WS-I) guidelines, and will implement REST style (38) interfaces to most of the services. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, this basically means that each unique URL is a representation of some object. It is possible to get the contents of that object using an HTTP GET and use an HTTP POST to modify the object. It provides improved response times and server loading characteristics due to support for caching and the fact that no XML parsing is involved. Clients are easy to build, and no toolkits are required. However, tooling and infrastructure for SOAP provide greater productivity, making it a more strategic investment for a wider range of long-term requirements. More information can be obtained at http://www.ebi. ac.uk/Tools/webservices/about/rest.

CONCLUSION
We have presented here a set of services that give the user more direct access to data and services from the EBI. Users can access all data and applications as if they were installed in their local machines, providing seamless integration between disparate services and allowing the construction of workflows to perform complex tasks.

ABSTRACT
A new functional gene database, FOAM (Functional Ontology Assignments for Metagenomes), was developed to screen environmental metagenomic sequence datasets. FOAM provides a new functional ontology dedicated to classify gene functions relevant to environmental microorganisms based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Sets of aligned protein sequences (i.e. `profiles') were tailored to a large group of target KEGG Orthologs (KOs) from which HMMs were trained. The alignments were checked and curated to make them specific to the targeted KO. Within this process, sequence profiles were enriched with the most abundant sequences available to maximize the yield of accurate classifier models. An associated functional ontology was built to describe the functional groups and hierarchy. FOAM allows the user to select the target search space before HMM-based comparison steps and to easily organize the results into different functional categories and subcategories. FOAM is publicly available at http://portal.nersc.gov/project/m1317/FOAM/.
INTRODUCTION
Continuous evolution of next generation sequencing (NGS) permits acquisition of increasingly large DNA and RNA sequence datasets at a relatively low cost. These NGS

approaches have resulted in tremendous breakthroughs in the study of human-associated microbial communities (1,2). The environmental microbiology scientific community is also applying NGS to study the composition of phylogenetic and functional genes in microbial communities (metagenomics) and to study which genes are expressed (metatranscriptomics). Recent examples include understanding of the impact of climate change on carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions in soil and sediment microbial communities (3-6), and mining of metagenomes for genes that encode novel enzymes of interest for biotechnology applications and biofuel production (7,8). However, a current bottleneck in meta-omic analyses of environmental microbial communities is the lack of tools to accurately assess functional information without excessive computational time.
In particular, soil has been considered the `grand challenge' for metagenomics sequencing projects for several reasons (9). First, the majority of the microorganisms in soil have never been cultivated and their functions are not known. Second, the high diversity and complexity of soil microbial communities is a challenge for metagenome assembly (10). Third, the annotations suffer from lacking functional assignments (as the microorganisms from which they originate have not yet been cultivated and no genome sequence data exists), and there are several genes that have more than one functional assignment in existing databases making correct gene assignments difficult. This deficiency is exemplified when screening for genes involved in specific biochemical cycles, such as methane oxidation or

methanogenesis in KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), which are currently classified by Gene Ontology (11) within five categories: `biological process', `metabolic process', `biosynthetic process', `cellular biosynthetic process' and `alkane biosynthetic process'. Another example, KEGG Brite (12), classifies methanogenesis at the fourth functional sublevel (as `methane metabolism'). Finally, there remain computational challenges when screening big datasets, such as those represented by gigabases (Gb) to terabases (Tb) of sequence data, due to the requirement for access to super computers and excessive computational time (13).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
To address these challenges we aimed to build a manually curated and validated database for screening of environmental metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequence datasets for functional genes. We focused on biochemical functions and metabolic pathways important in environmental microbial ecology, including global carbon and nitrogen cycles, by manually selecting and organizing functional gene information into a database here called `FOAM' (Functional Ontology Assignments for Metagenomes).
First, KEGG orthologs (KOs) (12) were retrieved to fit within a hierarchical organization from general features to specific pathways (such as denitrification, methanogenesis, etc.). KEGG KO (a reference set of homologous genes, consistent in known functions) benefits from stability, good maintenance, curation, and third party annotation. The KEGG KO was chosen as the FOAM `unit' because it is a qualitative and dynamically maintained knowledge base associated with a rich tool environment that is available within or outside of KEGG. Additionally, using KEGG KO permits the use of all visualization KEGG tools or third party software that have been released [e.g. Cytoscape (14), Glamm (15), Voronto (16), iPATH (17), bioconductor Pathview package (18)]. KEGG KO lists the genes defined in KEGG that belong to each functional and homologous family and, as a consequence, these can be multi-domain and multi-functional. Here, to provide accurate functional annotation, each FOAM module was constructed to ideally target one function.
The reduced size of the resultant FOAM database, compared to non-specific sequence databases, was a first step towards significant improvement in the speed and specificity of similarity searches. In addition, to improve upon the sensitivity of conventional heuristic alignment programs, we turned each KO set into Hidden Markov Models (HMMs; 19) by fetching their corresponding protein family (Pfam) profiles (20) as described in Figure 1. This step generated a sizeable number of conflicts (several Pfam per KO and vice versa) that were automatically resolved by functional assignments to KO. For the few remaining unresolved assignations, the corresponding set of sequences was manually split according to the topology of their phylogenetic trees. At this point the HMMs were re-trained from the new pool of sequences.
By retrieving the sequences of the corresponding Pfam of each selected KO, in addition to the sequences already present in the FOAM database, we ensured precise de-

tection of functions from potentially distant homologs. With this method, 74 000 peptide sequence profiles were specifically tailored and trained to predict functions as defined in KEGG KO. This profile-based searching approach enabled identification of less conserved regions along sequence alignments. Thus this method is applicable for searching for more distant homologs, similar to the approach used by Pfam (20) and TIGRFAM (21). However, we found that most Pfam and TIGRFAM models provide multiple KEGG KO assignments and did not serve our needs for retrieval of functionally specific annotations from metagenomes. Also, Pfam and TIGRFAM do not focus on environmental processes and cover only few functions of interest for different environmental sources. Additionally, Pfam and TIGRFAM are based on a simplified alignment, called `SEED', which is composed of a collection of sequences representative of a protein family, whereas our aim was a more comprehensive recruitment of more distant homologs. Recently, FunGene (22) was published as a new toolkit specialized to process amplicon data for functional genes, focusing on marker genes (100 currently available). FunGene provides users with HMMs for their marker genes of interest as a tool to test primers and probes. Moreover, FunGene allows users to build and submit new HMMs. FOAM is complementary to FunGene: it includes 3000 custom protein models obtained by enriching Pfams relevant to environmental microbiology with more protein sequences. An additional attribute of FOAM is that KO assignments were screened during the manual calibration to ensure that the Pfam alignments all targeted the same KO. If parts of the alignments targeted other KOs they were omitted from building the models or manually reassigned. Importantly, FOAM is a database that can be complemented with input from the user community. The FOAM database is by no means complete and we encourage recommendations from future users for additional categories to input into FOAM.
Ontology definition
The ontology was defined according to following constraints: (i) cover major biochemical functions and pathways relevant to environmental microbiology; (ii) organize functional classes hierarchically to simplify functional group selections before or after the search step; (iii) use KEGG KO`s to refine the functional classification. FOAM therefore benefits from the quality of KEGG annotation and all the tools that make use of KO IDs. Several KOs are present in several functional classes to keep the pathway complete at the higher level.
To address the first two constraints, we mainly drew from a comprehensive bacterial physiology and metabolism reference text (23) that was completed by KEGG BRITE ontology (12) information. The resulting FOAM hierarchy is limited to five functional levels: level 1 is the most general function group definition and level 5 the most refined, with level 5 corresponding to KO levels. The resulting FOAM ontology is distributed in the form of a tabulated file on the FOAM website. For example, the level 1 FOAM entry #11 refers to the nitrogen cycle (Table 1; http://portal. nersc.gov/project/m1317/FOAM/data/release 1/) and con-

tains 52 KOs. There are four functional groups at level 2 of the database: `reduction of nitrogenous compounds' (i.e. reductive reactions involving nitrogen compounds), `nitrogen fixation', `ammonia assimilation' and `nitrification'. The FOAM level 2 group, `reduction of nitrogenous compounds', is further subdivided into four categories: `denitrification', `assimilatory nitrate reduction', `dissimilatory nitrate reduction' and `hydroxylamine reduction'. Subsequently, the FOAM level 2 group of `nitrification' is subdivided into the following categories: `ammonia to hydroxylamine' and `hydroxylamine to nitrite'. This example illustrates that some KOs (e.g. hydroxylamine oxidoreductase) may be found in more than one FOAM category, as gene products may be involved in more than one biochemical pathway.
Database construction
Approximately 74 000 HMMs were generated and distributed into either a single file, or 21 HMMer (19) formatted files, where each HMM corresponded to the most refined functional level in the hierarchical FOAM ontology. To generate models, we developed a pipeline, triggered for each KO referenced in FOAM. Then, based on KEGG assignment information, the system retrieved all combinations of Pfams assigned to a KO. From those combinations, sequences in the IMG (version 4) protein database containing the Pfams were retrieved; including protein sequences annotated from microbial genomes and metagenomes. This process enriched preexisting Pfams with

additional sequence information (particularly metagenomic sequences). The sequences were aligned with Pfam models using hmmalign (part of HMMer 3 suite) and recurring gaps were removed after this step. At this stage, we gained a number of protein profiles (defined as an alignment or model that represents a group of sequences which serves for comparison) per KO equal to retrieved Pfams. An individual Pfam usually has multiple-KO assignments, making them less specific. Therefore, profiles were grafted together into one alignment and a Maximum Likelihood tree was built through the FastTree program (24) to identify clades on the topology consistent with sequence KO annotation--here called clusters (Figure 1). Grafting alignments is relevant because some sequences may be present in several Pfams, linking them with other sequences in a different Pfam (see Figure 1 step 5 and Venn diagram in Supplementary Data 2).
Detection of KO consistent branches was done by browsing the tree from the leaves to ascendant nodes provided that the subtree gathered leaves with only the same KO assignment. Once completed, the subtree was excised and the algorithm restarted from the remaining tree. A consistent subtree was defined as the largest subtree that has a single KO annotation. Due to the nature of the KO annotation it is possible that some genes may have had more than one KO assigned to them. In that case, we still accepted them if they had the common KO of the subtree. Furthermore, each KO was mapped to EC numbers and a consistent subtree may have all genes assigned to the same EC number,

On average, an HMM is made from an alignment of 81 peptide sequences and about 26 HMMs are built per KO. The file size is 7 GB.

or the same first three digits of the EC number. In any of the above scenarios, we reported the members of the subtree and their corresponding annotation (common KO or EC number). A caveat of this approach is that we did not consider the quality of the tree in the tree-splitting step (i.e. weakly supported branches were equally treated as strongly supported ones), producing models of different qualities. Nevertheless, we decided that the approach of rational classification is better than no classification at all. In the future, the groups could be recomputed, or split more optimally when more data become available (e.g. more KOs). From each cluster related to the KO in process, we extracted the alignment from which HMMs were eventually built.
RESULTS
Validation
As FOAM was constructed entirely from protein sequences in Pfam and in JGI-IMG without sourcing KEGG peptides, we used KEGG peptides for validation. Because each KEGG sequence has a KO assignment, resulting comparisons were relatively straightforward. We also compared FOAM HMMs to UNIPROT--Swissprot (25), but this required searching for files generated by KEGG to make the link between KEGG and Swissprot IDs. Therefore, validation of HMMs in FOAM included all KEGG protein sequences (with genuine KO assignments) and those in Swissprot. To accomplish this, the hmmsearch program was launched and the best hits with a `per domain' score >25 were kept. In order to compute quality metrics, we had to address a multi-class problem because each item (here sequence) had to be labeled with one of more than two KOs. To do so, we built a `confusion matrix' from which the validation metrics were derived (Supplementary Table S1). As each FOAM HMM targets one or multiple KOs, or each

classified sequence, we considered the best hit as a true positive if at least one KO assigned by KEGG corresponded to one predicted KO (an example of how a confusion matrix is filled and metrics are computed is given in Table 2).
Validation results are shown in Figure 2 and indicate good FOAM classification performance for all indices. Indeed, at the KO level (the most refined classification level) precision reached 92% in both tests; with 82% (Swissprot test) or 69% (KEGG peptides test) sensitivity. Notably, a majority of misclassifications at the KO level were assigned to very close KOs (in terms of ID which usually means functional similarity) explaining the jump in values when KOs are gathered in higher classes starting at FOAM ontogeny level 4 which normally gathers several very close KOs.
As a specific example, we extracted the data from the validation we performed for K02588, which contains the nifH gene, and is known to be problematic (many false positives) due to its domain architecture. The Swissprot database contains 70 proteins annotated as K02588. Running the HMMs, we were able to classify 68 of these correctly, 0 were incorrect, and 2 were false negatives; thus illustrating the power of FOAM.
DISCUSSION
In the new era of metagenomics, faced with the growth of large databases, increasing numbers of sequencing projects, and consequently large sequence datasets, we identified a need for a functional gene database that covers the diversity of known microbial metabolic processes; in particular for environmental metagenomes. The resulting FOAM database that we present here has many strengths for the user including core function models, i.e. FOAM HMMs tailored for KO assignments, and an organizational structure based on biochemical cycles with environmental rele-

The matrix is initialized by labeling rows (KEGG assignment) and columns (FOAM assignment) according to the KO list available in FOAM. Then, for
each classification in the hmmsearch output, a cell in the matrix is incremented: if K2 is predicted as K2, then tp2 is incremented, if K3 is predicted as K1, then e31 is incremented. At the end, trace (diagonal summation), sums per row, sums per column are computed and quality metrics calculated. Here this calculation has been performed for K00001, K00002, K00010, K00200.

vance. The resulting HMM construction pipeline has several strengths, including: (i) improved specificity for classifying peptides or translated reads/contigs into functions because sequences were selected according to phylogenetic analyses to become KO-specific classifiers and (ii) increased sensitivity that is crucial when dealing with diverse and underexplored environments (e.g. soil). The KEGG KO was chosen as the FOAM `unit' because it is a dynamically maintained knowledge base associated with a rich tool set available within or outside of KEGG (KEGGML, GLAMM, iPath, Voronto, etc.). That being said, FOAM does not aim to replace other existing systems, such as MG-RAST, IMG/M, KEGG genes, KO, Phylofacts (FAT-CAT) (26,27), or Pfam, for metagenome annotation. Rather, FOAM provides the community with a tool for precise functional annotations even when distant homologs have been obtained by shotgun metagenomic sequencing.
We also defined a large set of environmentally important functions for gene mining, which we organized into 5 levels of resolution. This enables the user to focus on specific functional groups by preselecting the relevant models or by organizing the results into classified functional families. As an example, we annotated two soil metagenomic datasets after quality trimming/filtering and assembly using Velvet. The coding regions were then searched from contigs using Prodigal (in mode `meta') and HMMer (19) run against the HMMs from FOAM CarboActive enzyme ontology group. The first metagenome, from a prairie soil, was 300 Gbp,

assembled in 5 901 346 contigs (N50: 609 bp), producing 7 716 071 ORFs. The second metagenome, from adjacent cultivated soil, was 200 Gb, assembled in 4 592 072 contigs (N50: 548 bp) with 6 059 007 ORFs. The annotation of these two datasets took 200 cpu hours. In another example, we used the whole FOAM database to annotate 6 657 648 Miseq reads (75 bp in length) from permafrost. The sequences were translated into all six reading frames and the translated file was run through hmmsearch on a Dell PowerEdge R910 with 40 cores and 1 TB of RAM. The hmmsearch devoted 5 cpus on average at any given time and this search took 55 h to run, i.e. 275 cpu hours. These two examples demonstrate that FOAM is an appropriate tool for characterization and comparison of different functional genes in large and highly complex environmental metagenome datasets.
In summary, analysis of current environmental metagenomes is often challenging due to the high diversity and large proportion of uncharacterized microbial taxa in most environmental habitats. Such data require more sensitive tools to identify distant homologs while minimizing computational cost. The FOAM database represents a useful and expedient tool for informative analyses of these data. The assignment sensitivity was increased with HMMs that were trained from sequence alignment profiles, and use of HMMer 3.0 provided model queries that were as expedient as BLAST (28,29). Additionally, FOAM allows easy narrowing of a search to specific target

Figure 2. Validation results. For each of the five functional levels available in the FOAM ontology, three metrics were computed: recall (or sensitivity), precision (known also as `positive predictive value' or sometime `specificity') and F1-score (the harmonic mean of both). In all cases, precision stays >92% at the KO level to reach 97% at level 1 (21 classes). Recall varies much more, from 69% at the KO level, to 98% at level 1. Levels 2, 3 and 4 gave similar performance results for both recall and precision; and their F1-score `mean' within a range of 92-94%.

functional categories. As each model is trained with an average of 80 sequences, FOAM screens a dataset with a selective database 80 faster than BLAST to test the same content, while resulting in a higher sensitivity.

ABSTRACT
The GWIPS-viz browser (http://gwips.ucc.ie/) is an on-line genome browser which is tailored for exploring ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) data. Since its publication in 2014, GWIPS-viz provides Ribo-seq data for an additional 14 genomes bringing the current total to 23. The integration of new Ribo-seq data has been automated thereby increasing the number of available tracks to 1792, a 10-fold increase in the last three years. The increase is particularly substantial for data derived from human sources. Following user requests, we added the functionality to download these tracks in bigWig format. We also incorporated new types of data (e.g. TCP-seq) as well as auxiliary tracks from other sources that help with the interpretation of Ribo-seq data. Improvements in the visualization of the data have been carried out particularly for bacterial genomes where the Ribo-seq data are now shown in a strand specific manner. For higher eukaryotic datasets, we provide characteristics of individual datasets using the RUST program which includes the triplet periodicity, sequencing biases and relative inferred A-site dwell times. This information can be used for assessing the quality of Ribo-seq datasets. To improve the power of the signal, we aggregate Ribo-seq data from several studies into Global aggregate tracks for each genome.
INTRODUCTION
Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) is a biochemical technique that utilizes high throughput sequencing that captures the mRNA fragments that are protected by actively translating ribosomes (1) thereby providing Genome-Wide Information on Protein Synthesis (GWIPS) (2). Ribo-seq was first carried out in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1) and has since been used in many organisms resulting in a substantial growth in the number of published datasets. The numerous applications of the ribosome profiling technique as well as its limitations are described in details elsewhere (3- 14). While the majority of Ribo-seq datasets represent foot-

prints of elongating ribosomes, a number of studies have used protocols for enriching footprints deriving from initiating ribosomes and more recently a modification of the ribosome profiling protocol allowed footprinting of scanning ribosomes (15).
To account for differences in mRNA abundance, most Ribo-seq studies also generate parallel datasets where total mRNA (or total RNA) is randomly degraded and subsequently sequenced. Here we refer to such datasets as mRNA-seq. To date, the majority of published Riboseq/mRNA-seq raw sequencing data have been deposited in NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (16).
The GWIPS-viz browser (http://gwips.ucc.ie/) uses the functionality of the UCSC Genome Browser (17) to provide visualizations of Ribo-seq coupled with mRNA-seq controls so that users can freely explore pre-populated Riboseq/mRNA-seq tracks without the need to download, preprocess and align raw sequencing data to the corresponding genomes. Since its original publication (18), we have striven to expand the repertoire of Ribo-seq/mRNA-seq data hosted on GWIPS-viz. We have also incorporated additional tracks as well as improved visualizations to help users better interpret the Ribo-seq/mRNA-seq data.
New genomes in GWIPS-viz
In 2014, GWIPS-viz provided Ribo-seq/mRNA-seq data for nine genomes: Homo sapiens (hg19), Mus musculus (mm10), Danio rerio (danRer7), Caenorhabditis elegans (ce10), S. cerevisiae (sacCer3), Escherichia coli K12 (ASM584 v2), Bacillus subtilis (11/09/2009), human cytomegalovirus (HHV5 strain Merlin) and bacteriophage lambda (NC 001416). Today GWIPS-viz provides Ribo-seq/mRNA-seq data for an additional 14 genomes: Rattus novegicus (rn6), Xenopus laevis (v6.0), Drosophila melanogaster (dm3), Trypanosoma brucei brucei (TriTrypDb TREU927 - v 5.1), Plasmodium falciparum (ASM276v1), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (ASM294v2), Neurospora crassa (or74a/GCF 000182925.2 NC12), Arabidopsis thaliana (Nov-2013), Zea Mays B73 (GCF 000005005.1 NC 024459.1), E. coli BW25113 (ASM75055v1), Caulobacter crescentus (ASM2200v1), Streptomyces coelicolor (ASM20383v1), Staphylococcus aureus USA300 FPR3757 (ASM1346 v1), S. aureus NCTC

8325 (ASM1342 v1). In addition, the more recent hg38 version of the human genome assembly has been provided.
New tracks in GWIPS-viz
As well as the addition of new genomes to GWIPS-viz, the number of hosted tracks has grown by 10-fold. This is largely a result of our automated computational pipeline for the integration of new Ribo-seq and mRNA-seq data for genomes already in the browser, bringing the total number of tracks to 1792 tracks across the 23 genomes. The increase has been particularly substantial for Ribo-seq data generated for human as well as for mouse and S. cerevisiae. New data since the original GWIPS-viz publication include: H. sapiens hg38 assembly (19-49), H. sapiens hg19 assembly (43,50-54), M. musculus (51,52,55-75), R. novegicus (76-78), D. rerio (79-81), X. laevis (82), C. elegans (83- 85), D. melanogaster (86-88), T. brucei brucei (89), P. falciparum (90), S. cerevisiae (15,64,82,85,91-109), S. pombe (82,110), N. crassa (111), A. thaliana (112-114), Z. Mays B73 (115), E. coli K12 (116-124), E. coli BW25113 (125), B. subtilis (126), C. crescentus (127), S. coelicolor (128), S. aureus USA300 FPR3757 (129), S. aureus NCTC 8325 (130). This expansion of datasets allows for improved crossspecies comparison of orthologous genes while the availability of datasets from multiple research groups permits the assessment of technical reproducibility of the ribosome densities (131).
In addition to individual tracks reflecting Ribo-seq data generated under different conditions for each study, we aggregate each study's data into an All track. We then aggregate the All tracks from each study into a Global Aggregate track for each genome (Figure 1A-D). This has the effect of improving the overall Ribo-seq signal by reducing the contribution of dataset specific biases and stochastic noise due to low coverage. The increased number of datasets is expected to yield higher sensitivity. The Global Aggregate tracks are set as the default for each genome and users can turn on/off each study's data contribution to the aggregated data and then refine the visualizations by turning on/off individual tracks in each study. In addition, we provide Global Aggregate tracks through the UCSC Genome Browser for the human hg38 and hg19 assemblies.
We have also incorporated a new type of data into GWIPS-viz. Recently the Preiss group developed a technique called translation complex profile sequencing (TCPseq), where ribosome subunits are cross-linked to mRNA, allowing footprinting of both elongating and scanning ribosomes (15). We now provide this data in the Small Ribosomal Subunits (Footprints) track group for S. cerevisiae. Given that TCP-seq is a powerful tool for studying translation initiation (132), we anticipate that the experimental protocol will be adapted for other species quite soon and we will strive to incorporate new TCP-seq data into GWIPS-viz as it becomes available.
For S. cerevisiae we also generated an additional gene annotation track from transcript isoform sequencing (TIF-seq) data (133). Given that Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) (134) and Ensembl (135) gene annotations for S. cerevisiae do not include UTR regions, and given that Ribo-seq has shown that extensive translation occurs in 5

leader regions (1) and to a lesser extent in 3 trailer regions (97), we thought it useful to integrate the 5 leader and 3 trailer gene annotations as interpreted by (133) from their TIF-seq data for S. cerevisiae.
With respect to 5 leader region delineation, we incorporated Riken 5 cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) data (136) as a permanent track in the Annotations Tracks and External Data track group for the human hg19 assembly. At the time of the incorporation, Riken CAGE data tracks for other GWIPS-viz assemblies were not available for permanent track integration. However, as GWIPS-viz also now includes the UCSC Genome Browser's Track Hub functionality (137), we provide Riken's FANTOM5 tracks for hg38, hg19, mm9 and rn6 as public track hubs. While these tracks are hosted and managed by the Riken group on their own server, a simple connection makes it easy to explore their CAGE data in conjunction with our Ribo-seq/mRNA-seq tracks in GWIPS-viz.
Initially we did not provide UCSC Genome Browser's custom track feature (138) in GWIPS-viz. The custom track is only accessible to the user who uploads it, i.e. it is not a publicly available track. Many GWIPS-viz users, however, expressed an interest in the custom track feature as a means to explore their own Ribo-seq data in the context of published data and so we now include it. The custom track feature is also particularly useful for users of RiboGalaxy (139), a Galaxy based platform (140) that we have developed specifically for processing, mapping and analysing Ribo-seq data. Researchers can use the GWIPS-viz suite of tools in RiboGalaxy to generate Ribo-seq profiles that infer either the A-site (elongating ribosomes) or P-site (initiating ribosomes) from either the 5 end or the 3 end of Ribo-seq reads and the resulting profiles can be directly visualised as custom tracks in GWIPS-viz. The direct interface between GWIPS-viz and RiboGalaxy also allows data from GWIPS-viz to be retrieved into RiboGalaxy. We also provide a direct link to RiboGalaxy (http://ribogalaxy.ucc.ie/) from the GWIPS-viz homepage.
Improvements in data visualizations
Previously for bacterial genomes (E. coli K12, B. subtilis) our Ribo-seq and mRNA-seq profiles on GWIPS-viz did not provide strand orientation information. Our Ribo-seq density plots also used the center-weighted approach (141) to infer ribosome A-sites. Since then, several studies have shown that inferring the ribosome decoding center from the 3 ends of bacterial Ribo-seq data is more accurate (124,142,143). We decided to carry-out an overhaul of our bacterial tracks and now provide strand orientation information using the UCSC Genome Browser overlay functionality (144) in addition to A-site inference using a fixed offset from 3 footprint ends (Figure 1A,B). We have extended these improvements to the new bacterial genomes we now host in GWIPS-viz (E. coli BW25113, C. crescentus, S. coelicolor, S. aureus NCTC 8325, S. aureus USA300 FPR3757).
Recently we integrated the multi-region exon-only view (17), which is particularly useful for displaying Ribo-seq data for higher eukaryotes where exonic regions may be interrupted by long intronic regions (Figure 1C,D).

Figure 1. Exploring ribosome profiling data using GWIPS-viz. (A and B) Strand specific representation of the data for overlapping genes nudG and ynjH in the E. coli genome. In panel A, the Ribo-seq and mRNA-seq reads mapping to the forward strand (red) and to the reverse strand (blue) are both displayed. In panel B, only the reads mapping to the reverse strand are displayed. The profiles were generated using the Global aggregate tracks for E. coli in GWIPSviz. (C and D) Aggregated human Ribo-seq data (red) at the SLC35A4 locus show that most of translation takes place at the uORF that spans the first three exons rather than the CDS (50,146,147). The exon-only view of the SLC35A4 locus improves the visualization of the translated uORF, the conservation of which is shown using the 100 vertebrates basewise conservation by PhyloP (148). (E) A RUST metafootprint profile that reveals the influence of mRNA codons on the relative read density in the vicinity of the ribosome is shown in grey in the top panel (145). The Kullback-Leibler divergence (blue for a single codon, green for adjacent codons) indicates the influence of each mRNA location on the frequency of ribosome footprint occurrence in the library. This is an example of a dataset with low sequencing biases, where the A-site codon influence is the highest. The lower left panel shows RUST estimates of relative codon decoding rates. The lower right panel shows the triplet periodicity signal (1,149) for individual read lengths. Panel E is taken from GWIPS-viz for study (20). (F) A screen-shot of the Downloads page that provides Ribo-seq and mRNA-seq read alignments for all tracks available in GWIPS-viz.

D826 Nucleic Acids Research, 2018, Vol. 46, Database issue

For higher eukaryotic datasets, we also now provide characteristics obtained with RUST (145). RUST utilizes Riboseq Unit Step Transfomation to normalize ribosome profiling data. It further provides characteristics of ribosome profiling datasets among which is a metafootprint profile which shows the difference between observed (experimental) and expected (equiprobable) frequencies of specific sequences (commonly codons) in the vicinity of a ribosome footprint. The expectation is that the highest variation in codon frequencies should occur at the ribosome decoding center (Asite) (Figure 1E). A high variation at the end of footprints would occur due to sequencing biases. Thus, metafootprint profiles can be used for assessing the level of sequencing biases in individual datasets. Clicking on each study link in the GWIPS-viz genome page will open a new page with the link to the RUST quality plots which include the RUST metafootprint profile as well as a plot showing triplet periodicity for reads of different lengths. The RUST plots also include a panel that shows the relative inferred A-site dwell times for each amino acid.
Downloading Ribo-seq and mRNA-seq alignments
Following user requests, we added the functionality to download our genomic alignments in bigWig format. While the Table Browser provides the option to download our Ribo-seq and mRNA-seq alignments in bedGraph format, many users requested our original alignment files. Hence, we built a separate Downloads page (Figure 1F) for this purpose. For each Ribo-seq study hosted on GWIPS-viz, users can download (1) ribosome profiles of elongating ribosomes (number of footprints whose inferred A-site match a specific coordinate, (2) Ribo-seq and (3) mRNA-seq coverage plots that provide the number of reads that map to each coordinate. Where available, data enriched with footprints of initiating ribosomes, represented as coordinates of inferred Psite codons, can also be downloaded. In addition, footprints of small ribosome subunits generated by TCP-seq (15) are available for download for S. cerevisiae as coverage plots.
FUTURE PLANS
The development of an automated computational data integration pipeline has greatly helped us to keep pace with the flux of new Ribo-seq data for genomes already existing in GWIPS-viz. We do, however, still have some backlog in terms of Ribo-seq data generated for genomes that we need to manually add to GWIPS-viz. We are examining ways in how we can improve our capacity to add new genomes particularly genomes that are not hosted on the UCSC Genome Browser.
We also aim to continue to improve the visualizations of Ribo-seq data. We wish to extend the overlay functionality with strand-specific display to all the data tracks in GWIPSviz (currently provided for bacterial genomes only). Conversely, we want to provide RUST characteristics for Riboseq data generated for bacteria. This requires adapting the RUST programming code to using 3 end offsetting for Asite inference which we plan to do soon. In addition, we want to use RUST parameters and other Ribo-seq specific parameters such as the triplet periodicity, to develop

a quality scoring method and provide this information on GWIPS-viz for each dataset. This will allow users to compare Ribo-seq datasets in terms of their quality across studies. It will also help us and our user-base to determine what governs Ribo-seq data quality and how it can be maintained and improved in future Ribo-seq data.
We also wish to avail of new functionality as it becomes available on the UCSC Genome Browser. For this reason, we have carried out several upgrades of the GWIPS-viz browser to keep in-line with the UCSC Genome Browser. The recent exon-only view is one such example which is particularly beneficial for eukaryotic organisms that extensively use RNA splicing, permitting genomic alignments of Riboseq data to be explored without intervening introns.

ABSTRACT
The RecQ family of helicases is highly conserved both structurally and functionally from bacteria to humans. Defects in human RecQ helicases are associated with genetic diseases that are characterized by cancer predisposition and/or premature aging. RecQ proteins exhibit 3 -5 helicase activity and play critical roles in genome maintenance. Recent advances in single-molecule techniques have revealed the reiterative unwinding behavior of RecQ helicases. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process remain unclear, with contradicting reports. Here, we characterized the unwinding dynamics of the Caenorhabditis elegans RecQ helicase HIM-6 using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements. We found that HIM-6 exhibits reiterative DNA unwinding and the length of DNA unwound by the helicase is sharply defined at 25-31 bp. Experiments using various DNA substrates revealed that HIM-6 utilizes the mode of `sliding back' on the translocated strand, without strand-switching for rewinding. Furthermore, we found that Caenorhabditis elegans replication protein A, a single-stranded DNA binding protein, suppresses the reiterative behavior of HIM-6 and induces unidirectional, processive unwinding, possibly through a direct interaction between the proteins. Our findings shed new light on the mechanism of DNA unwinding by RecQ family helicases and their co-operation with RPA in processing DNA.
INTRODUCTION
Helicases are molecular motors that couple the hydrolysis of triphosphates (typically ATP) to the unwinding of poly-

nucleic acid structures and have multifaceted roles in virtually all aspects of nucleic acid metabolism, including DNA replication, repair, recombination, transcription, chromosome segregation and telomere maintenance (1). The significance of helicases to cellular homeostasis is highlighted by the fact that defects in human RecQ helicases are linked to distinct heritable diseases. RecQ helicases belong to the SF2 family of helicases and are conserved from bacteria to humans. RecQ is a DNA structure-specific helicase that unwinds 3 -tailed duplexes, bubble structures, DNA displacement loops (D-loops), Holliday junctions and Gquadruplexes, thereby maintaining genomic stability (2,3). In humans, there are five RecQ helicases and mutations in three of the corresponding genes can lead to severe genetic disorders, namely, Werner syndrome (mutation of the WRN gene), Bloom syndrome (mutation of the BLM gene) and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (mutation of the RECQL4 gene), which are associated with predisposition to cancer and/or premature aging.
A number of studies show that BLM functions in homologous recombination, stabilization and repair of stalled forks, and sister chromatid segregation, which are associated with its unwinding activity and protein interactions (4). Recently, single-molecule studies showed that BLM unwinds forked DNAs, DNA hairpins, and G-quadruplexes in a highly repetitive fashion by alternating between unwinding and rewinding modes, a process referred to as `reiterative unwinding' (5-7). Other RecQ helicases also show such repetitive dynamics (8), and reiterative unwinding behavior seems to be a general feature of RecQ helicases. This behavior is thought to be important for in vivo DNA metabolism, for instance, processing stalled replication forks, eliminating potentially deleterious recombination intermediates, or stripping off other DNA binding proteins, as observed for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) translocases.
Several basic aspects of reiterative unwinding remain elusive. It is unclear how many base pairs (bp) are unwound before RecQ helicase changes direction, and which strand

the helicase moves along during rewinding. In addition, the mechanism by which RecQ makes a return is unknown, and it is unclear how the reiterative dynamics can be modulated by partner proteins. Several single-molecule studies suggest that the number of base pairs that are unwound before rewinding varies depending on the specific DNA substrate and assay used. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) measurements of forked DNA substrates estimated that human BLM unwinds fewer than 34 bp before rewinding (5). By contrast, measurements on DNA hairpins using magnetic tweezers suggested that human BLM unwinds 15 bp before rewinding, a value that was estimated from the unwinding time (6). Human WRN and its Arabidopsis thaliana homolog RECQ2 (AtRECQ2) also reiteratively unwind DNA hairpins (9,10), but the unwinding lengths have not been determined for these proteins. A few different models of DNA rewinding by RecQ helicases have been proposed. In one model, human BLM and AtRECQ2 switch strands for rewinding (5,10), whereas in another, human and chicken WRN slide back along the translocated strand (9,11), leaving the exact molecular mechanism of DNA rewinding to be elucidated.
RecQ helicases interact with several proteins, and their helicase activity is affected accordingly (3). Human replication protein A (RPA), a ssDNA binding protein, changes the reiterative unwinding mediated by human WRN into unidirectional unwinding (9), but does not inhibit the reiterative unwinding activity of human BLM (5). Such selective effects suggest that RPA may interact directly with RecQ helicases to modulate their unwinding activities. However, the exact mechanism by which RPA modulates the unwinding activity of RecQ helicases remains elusive. RPA may protect the unwound DNA to force unidirectional unwinding, or form a complex with the helicase, thereby modulating its conformation in favor of processive translocation.
Multicellular organisms possess several RecQ homologs. There are four members of the RecQ family in Caenorhabditis elegans, namely, recq-1, wrn-1, him-6, and rcq-5 (12- 15), and him-6 is an ortholog of human BLM (14). The HIM-6 protein utilizes DNA-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and 3 -5 DNA helicase activities to unwind forked DNAs, D-loops, and Holliday junctions (16). In the current study, we used smFRET techniques to characterize the DNA unwinding activity of HIM-6 and reveal the molecular mechanism of its reiterative unwinding mode and transition to the processive mode. We found that HIM6 consistently unwinds 25-31 nt from the ss/dsDNA junction of forked DNA and then moves backwards along the translocated strand without strand-switching. In addition, we found that the reiterative unwinding activity of HIM6 changes to unidirectional unwinding activity in the presence of C. elegans RPA (CeRPA). Our findings provide profound insights into how reiterative unwinding of DNA and its modulation control the functions of RecQ helicases in DNA metabolism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of DNA substrates
The DNA oligomers used in this study were synthesized to include biotin and amine modifications for dye labeling (In-

tegrated DNA Technologies, USA). The Cy3 and Cy5 NHS esters were purchased from GE Healthcare (USA) and conjugated to the internal dT of DNA oligos or terminal positions via a C6 amino linker (17). For each substrate, biotinconjugated DNA strands (1 M final concentration) and complementary strands (1.2 M) were annealed by heating to 90C for 5 min and then slowly cooling to 4C at a rate of -1C/min. The sequences and structures of the DNA oligomers are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Protein expression and purification
The C. elegans HIM-6/BLM protein was purified as described previously (16). The HIM-6 cDNA was cloned into expression vector pDEST17 for six-His-tagged protein (Gateway Cloning System, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The recombinant His6-tagged HIM-6 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21AI and purified with a Ni+-NTA agarose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The C. elegans RPA protein was purified as reported previously (18,19). CeRPA proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified using Ni+-NTA agarose and Hitrap-Q-sepharose. The purity of the proteins was checked on an sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis gel with coomassie blue staining. Purified proteins were verified using a MALDI TOF-TOF 4700 proteomics analyzer (POSTECH Biotech Center, Korea). Enzymatic activity of HIM-6 proteins was confirmed using DNA unwinding assay with radiolabeled DNA.
Single-molecule FRET assay
Pre-cleaned quartz slides and glass coverslips were coated with a mixture of polyethylene glycol (m-PEG-SVA-5000; Laysan Bio, USA) and biotinylated-PEG (biotin-PEG-SC5000; Laysan Bio) at a ratio of 40:1. Surface immobilization of the biotinylated DNA was mediated by NeutrAvidin (Thermo Scientific, USA). The standard reaction/imaging buffer contained 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mM KCl, 2 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs, USA), and saturated Trolox (3 mM), with an oxygen scavenging system (0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.6% (w/v) glucose and 0.06 mg/ml catalase) added prior to each measurement. The buffer contained equal concentrations of ATP and Mg2+. ATP was used at a concentration of 100 M in all experiments unless otherwise specified. A custom-built prism-type total internal reflection fluorescence microscope was used to perform the measurements. Imaging was performed at room temperature (22  1C).
Analysis of single-molecule FRET data
The FRET efficiency was calculated from the fluorescence intensities of the donor (ID) and acceptor (IA) using the formula EF RET = (IA -  ID)/(IA + ID) where  = 0.06 represents donor leakage correction. The smFRET histograms were generated from the traces containing a single pair of donor and acceptor, taking the frames before the photobleaching of dyes. smFRET histograms were fitted by single or double Gaussian peak curves. Data analysis was carried

out by scripts custom written in MATLAB, and data fitting to Michaelis-Menten and gamma distribution curves was performed using the Origin package (Origin Lab Corporation, USA). Post-synchronized FRET density plots were constructed from individual unwinding cycles. The traces were synchronized at the moment that the FRET efficiency reached the bottom and increased back. The fragmented unwinding cycles were overlaid and shown as density maps using the contour plot as described earlier (20). Kinetic rate constants were obtained by taking the inverse of the averaged dwell time in each stage. The fraction of Cy3 spots remaining in the imaging area was obtained by taking the average number of Cy3 spots from five images taken at different locations per each minute, in order not to be affected by the photobleaching of the dyes. This was repeated three times to obtain the averaged curves shown with standard deviation.
RESULTS
HIM-6 reiteratively unwinds forked DNA
HIM-6 unwinds dsDNA in the 3 -5 direction (14,16,21). To determine the molecular characteristics of the DNA unwinding process, we performed smFRET measurements using a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope. We designed a forked duplex DNA substrate, named FK50, containing a 50 bp duplex region, a 3 single-stranded tail of (dT)30 labeled with Cy3 (donor) fluorophore at the ss/dsDNA junction and a 5 single-stranded tail of (dT)17 labeled with Cy5 (acceptor) fluorophore located 7 nt away from the junction and biotinylated at the end for surface immobilization (Figure 1A). The structures and sequences of the DNA substrates are included in Supplementary Table S1. The substrate was immobilized on a polyethylene glycol-coated quartz surface via biotin-neutravidin interaction, and pre-incubated with HIM-6 (30 nM) for 5 min. The unwinding reaction was then initiated by introducing 100 M ATP after washing out unbound proteins.
As shown by the representative FRET trace in Figure 1B, there was a gradual decrease of the initially high FRET level, followed by a fast increase and then a pause until the next repetitive cycle. A large number of traces (39%) showed this repetitive pattern of FRET changes, with FRET efficiencies (EFRET) fluctuating between 0.25 and 0.85 until the fluorophores were photobleached. The FRET dynamics were ATP hydrolysis-dependent because such fluctuations were not observed in the presence of ATP S, a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP or with a helicase-defective HIM-6 mutant in which lysine 275 was mutated to alanine (K275A; Supplementary Figure S1). The high EFRET of 0.85 corresponded to the intact forked DNA, in which the fluorophores were located close together, as demonstrated by the fact that the same FRET level was observed for the bare FK-50 substrate prior to the addition of proteins (Figure 1C). The subsequent decrease in EFRET indicated unwinding of the forked DNA by the helicase activity of HIM6. If HIM-6 had fully separated the two strands of FK50, it would have resulted in complete disappearance of the fluorescence signal due to dissociation of the Cy3-labeled translocated strand. However, the FRET level paused at

0.25 during each repetitive cycle, as indicated by the corresponding peak in the FRET population histogram (Figure 1B and C). This peak at an EFRET of 0.25 was likely associated with the cessation of DNA unwinding activity. The subsequent rapid increase in EFRET back to its initial level was interpreted as the rewinding of duplex DNA, and the whole process started again after a pause. The repetitive cycle must have occurred via reinitiation of unwinding by the same helicase protein, because the unbound proteins in solution were washed away prior to the addition of ATP. Full unwinding of FK-50 occurred only rarely, as shown by a minor decrease in the fraction of Cy3 spots in the presence of active HIM-6 (Figure 1D). These observations indicate that HIM-6 is capable of repetitively unwinding DNA but rarely performs full unwinding of its substrate.
DNA unwinding and waiting times depend on the ATP concentration
Each cycle of the observed FRET changes could be dissected into three stages: the unwinding stage (U), during which the FRET level gradually decreased to 0.25; the rewinding/reannealing stage (R), during which the FRET level rapidly returned to 0.85; and the waiting stage (W), during which the FRET signal remained at 0.85 until the next unwinding cycle (Figure 2A). To visualize the variations in FRET dynamics between different unwinding cycles or different HIM-6 molecules, we separated the individual cycles and overlaid the traces after synchronizing them at the boundary between the unwinding and rewinding stages. This produced density plots showing the distribution of the FRET level changing over time (Figure 2B). A comparison of the density plots generated in reactions using 100 M or 1 mM ATP clearly showed a dependence of the unwinding speed on ATP concentration, as indicated by a temporally narrower pattern at 1 mM ATP than at 100 M ATP. Remarkably, the density plots also revealed a highly homogeneous pattern of FRET changes between different cycles or different HIM-6 molecules. In addition, rewinding consistently brought the FRET level back to the initial level seen for the intact duplex DNA. These results suggest that HIM-6 performs the unwinding cycle in a highly regular manner, rather than stochastically switching between the cycle stages.
Next, we measured the duration of each stage of the unwinding process with varying ATP concentrations (50 M to 3 mM) and calculated kinetic rates for transitions between the stages, which were obtained by taking the inverse of the average dwell time in each stage. The speed of the unwinding stage exhibited clear ATPdependence (Figure 2C). The ATP-dependent unwinding rate was fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation, v = Vmax[ATP]/(Km + [ATP]), and yielded a maximum rate (Vmax) of 1.29  0.07 s-1 and a Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of 0.31  0.05 mM. On the other hand, the rewinding rate was not altered at varying ATP concentrations, giving consistent values of 1.4 s-1 (Figure 2D). This finding implies that the helicase is likely to passively slide back along one of the separated DNA strands without consuming ATP. Rapid rezipping of the duplex DNA is possibly the driving force to push the helicase back along the

strand during this stage. Like the unwinding stage, the waiting stage was also ATP concentration-dependent, fitting to the Michaelis-Menten curve with a Vmax of 0.87  0.08 s-1 and a Km of 0.14  0.04 mM (Figure 2E). This finding indicates that the helicase is not merely at rest after completing rewinding, but actively re-engages in the next unwinding cycle, possibly by translocating along the ssDNA tail(s) to return to the fork junction. The distributions of the dwell times at each stage of the cyclic unwinding-rewinding process were fit to gamma distributions with shape parameters of 7.17  0.63, 7.50  2.03 and 4.12  0.59 for the unwinding, rewinding, and waiting stages, respectively (Fig-

ure 2F-H), suggesting that each stage consists of multiple sub-steps rather than a single dominating step. However, the possible sub-steps were not directly resolved from our measurements. Also, the existence of ATP-driven motions in the rewinding stage cannot be completely ruled out because helicase activity was not clearly observable at ATP concentration below 50 M.
The return point of HIM-6
The persistent reiteration of unwinding without fully separating the dsDNA substrate suggests that HIM-6 stops after unwinding a certain length of DNA and before reach-

ing the end of the duplex substrate, and then moves back to the original fork junction. To identify the position at which HIM-6 returns, we generated multiple DNA substrates in which Cy3/Cy5 pairs were placed at varying distances from the junction (Figure 3A and Supplementary Table S1). The FK-50(D0) substrate was identical to the FK-50 substrate used in Figure 1. In the FK-50(D18), FK-50(D25) and FK50(D31) substrates, the Cy3 dye was located at the 18th, 25th and 31st nt from the ss/dsDNA junction on the 3 strand, respectively, and the Cy5 dye was located at the 15th, 22nd and 28th nt from the junction on the 5 strand, re-

spectively. Although the reiterative unwinding dynamics of FK-50(D18) and FK-50(D25) were similar to that of FK50(D0) (Figure 3B), the FRET level of the low FRET population increased with increasing distance between the labels and the junction (Figure 3C). This finding indicates that the 18th and 25th nucleotides were closer to the limiting position of unwinding than the first nucleotide. Even though the FRET levels were different, the frequencies of the unwinding events were comparable between the D0, D18 and D25 substrates (Figure 3D), indicating that HIM-6 unwinds DNA consistently up to 25 bp without returning to the fork

junction. By contrast, the D31 substrate did not exhibit any FRET dynamics, but showed a stable high FRET population (Figure 3B and C). The sharp contrast in the dynamics between FK-50(D25) and FK-50(D31) suggests that the returning position of HIM-6 is narrowly defined between the 25th and 31st nt.
To determine if the returning point is determined by either the length of the duplex DNA remaining ahead of the helicase or the length of the unwound DNA, we designed FK-18 substrate, which contained a shorter duplex region of 18 bp and the same ssDNA tails as FK-50 (Figure 3E). In experiments using FK-18, the FRET level dropped upon the addition of HIM-6 and ATP, immediately followed by disappearance of the Cy3 signal, indicating full separation of the duplex FK-18 substrate (Figure 3F). Accordingly, the number of Cy3 spots per imaging area decreased rapidly upon loading 30 nM helicase and 1 mM ATP (Figure 3G).
We tested another set of DNA substrates which contains a 60-bp duplex region, labeled at D0, D25 or D31 positions, named FK-60(D0), FK-60(D25) and FK-60(D31), respectively (Supplementary Figure S2A, sequence information in Supplementary Table S1). FK-60(D0) and FK-60(D25) displayed similar unwinding signals as FK-50 substrates upon the addition of HIM-6 and ATP while FK-60(D31) did not show unwinding signals (Supplementary Figure S2B-G), confirming that HIM-6 does not go beyond the 31st nt regardless of the substrate length. These results unambiguously show that the returning point is determined by the number of unwound base pairs rather than the remaining DNA duplex length.
HIM-6 actively translocates along the 3 ssDNA tail to reinitiate unwinding
Since the waiting time of the cyclical HIM-6-mediated unwinding process was ATP-dependent (Figure 2E), we conjectured that the helicase must be actively translocating along one or both of the DNA tails during the waiting stage, in preparation to re-engage in the next unwinding event. If HIM-6 stays on the translocated strand (the strand with the 3 ssDNA tail) throughout the rewinding and waiting stages, the waiting time would only depend on the length of the 3 ssDNA tail. By comparison, if HIM-6 switches to the displaced strand (the strand with the 5 ssDNA tail), more steps will be required to place the helicase back at the junction; specifically, the helicase would have to switch to the displaced strand, return along the displaced strand, switch back to the translocated strand and then translocate to the junction. In this case, the waiting time is likely to depend on the lengths of both the 5 and 3 ssDNA tails. To identify which DNA strand HIM-6 uses during the waiting stage, we measured the waiting times on four forked DNA substrates with varying lengths of ssDNA tails (Figure 4A and Supplementary Table S1). For example, the 5 T03 T10 substrate contained no 5 ssDNA tail and a 3 ssDNA tail of (dT)10, and the 5 T103 T30 substrate contained a 5 ssDNA tail of (dT)10 and a 3 ssDNA tail of (dT)30. The smFRET time traces for 5 T03 T10, 5 T103 T10, 5 T03 T30, 5 T103 'T30, 5 T303 T30 and 5 T103 T50 substrates indicated similar reiterative unwinding patterns but the waiting time varied between the substrates with different tail lengths. The waiting

time turned out to be nearly proportional to the length of the 3 ' ssDNA tail, resulting in a more frequent onset of the unwinding cycle for the substrates with shorter 3 tail (Figure 4A and B). On the other hand, it did not vary upon changing the length of the 5 ssDNA tail and 5 T03 T30, 5 T103 T30 and 5 T303 T30 showed a similar waiting time. These results suggest that the 5 ssDNA tail is not translocated by HIM-6 in the waiting stage, and that HIM-6 uses the 3 ssDNA tail (translocated strand) exclusively. It is still possible that HIM-6 switches to the displaced strand at certain point and then returns to the translocated strand before reaching the ss/dsDNA junction. Substrates containing either a short 3 tail (5 T03 T10 and 5 T103 T10) or no 5 tail (5 T03 T10 and 5 T03 T30) showed higher FRET levels in the unwinding stage than the other substrates (Figure 4A). Thus, HIM-6 may interact with both strands during unwinding and the initial contact of HIM-6 with DNA strands at the ss/dsDNA junction may determine the extent of strand separation during unwinding.
Next, we tried to block HIM-6 translocation along each ssDNA tail using flapped substrates formed by annealing another DNA oligomer to the 5 or 3 ssDNA tail (named 3 FLAP and 5 FLAP, respectively; Figure 4C and D). Similar to what was observed for the substrate with the shorter 3 tail, 5 FLAP substrate showed a reduced waiting time, resulting in a more frequent onset of the unwinding cycle (Figure 4D and E). By contrast, 3 FLAP substrate showed an even longer waiting time than the non-flapped substrate. The duplex tail of 3 FLAP substrate might modulate the relocation of HIM-6 to the junction. For example, a domain of HIM-6, e.g. the helicase-and-RNase-D-C-terminal (HRDC) domain, may interact with the duplex tail, affecting the relocation of HIM-6 to the junction. Based on these results, we propose that HIM-6 actively translocates along the 3 ssDNA tail of the translocated strand during the waiting stage.
HIM-6 slides back along the translocated strand during rewinding
The fact that the rapid FRET increase during the rewinding stage was ATP-independent suggests that HIM-6 slides back along the DNA strand in a passive manner during the rewinding stage, possibly caused by the rapid rezipping of DNA. To determine which strand HIM-6 moves along during the rewinding stage, we designed DNA substrates with no 5 ssDNA tail of the displaced strand and placed Cy5 at this end of the strand (Figure 5A) and speculated the following scenarios. If HIM-6 moves along the displaced strand during rewinding, the junction of the DNA substrate would remain partially separated until the helicase switches back to the translocated strand, because it must be holding several terminal nucleotides of the displaced strand. Thus, at the end of rewinding, the FRET level would not immediately return to that of the intact duplex DNA, but rather stay at a lower level until the helicase switches back (Figure 5A). We tested two such DNA substrate designs without 5 ssDNA tails and with a Cy3 label on the translocated strand either upstream or downstream of the ss/dsDNA junction (Figure 5B and F). On both substrates, the FRET level immediately returned to the original level of the bare DNA at

In the strand-switching mode, once HIM-6 has translocated along the displaced strand or slid back to the end of the 5 tail, the FRET level would remain at a lower level until HIM-6 switches back to the 3 tail. In the sliding-back mode without strand-switching, as HIM-6 slides back along the translocated strand and passes by the dye position, the FRET level would immediately go back to its original high level.

the end of rewinding (Figure 5C-E and G-I). These results suggest that the rewinding process occurs not by switching to and sliding along the displaced strand, but by sliding back along the translocated strand (Figure 5A). It still cannot be ruled out that HIM-6 switched to the displaced strand at the end of unwinding and returned to the translocated strand before reaching the original junction, or it returned at the end of rewinding quickly beyond the imaging time resolution (100 ms).
Based on the results described above, we propose the following model for the reiterative unwinding of DNA by HIM-6: (i) HIM-6 actively unwinds 25-31 bp of DNA by translocating in the 3 -5 direction (unwinding stage); (ii) subsequently, HIM-6 shifts to a returning mode, possibly by losing its grip on DNA strands through a conformational change and slides back along the same strand in a passive manner beyond the original forked junction, allowing the DNA to rapidly rezip (rewinding stage); (iii) HIM-6 then actively translocates along the 3 ssDNA tail of the same strand to get back to the junction and reinitiate unwinding (waiting stage).
CeRPA switches the reiterative unwinding of HIM-6 to unidirectional unwinding
A previous study shows that human BLM can unwind duplex DNA molecules longer than 200 bp in the presence of human RPA (hRPA) in bulk unwinding reactions (22). However, in single-molecule assays, BLM shows repetitive unwinding of short duplex DNA substrates (5). To resolve this discrepancy, we investigated the modulation of the reiterative unwinding of HIM-6 by CeRPA. A 73 kDa subunit (RPA-1) and a 32 kDa subunit (RPA-2) form an active, stable CeRPA complex that is sufficient for RPA function (18,19). First, we examined the ssDNA binding activity of CeRPA by smFRET measurements. A partial duplex DNA labeled with Cy3 at the end of the 3 ssDNA tail and Cy5 at the ss/dsDNA junction showed a high FRET efficiency of 0.8, which went down to 0.4 within seconds after the addition of 20 nM CeRPA (Supplementary Figure S3A). The FRET decrease indicated rapid binding of CeRPA to the ssDNA tail, causing tail extension. We also confirmed that the E. coli ssDNA binding protein, SSB, assembled rapidly on the ssDNA tail (Supplementary Figure S3B).
The FK-50(D31) substrate was incubated with HIM-6 (30 nM), unbound HIM-6 was washed out and then 100 M ATP was added (Figure 6A). No FRET change was observed at this point as the labels were positioned past the unwinding limit of HIM-6 (Figure 3B and C). However, adding 20 nM CeRPA while maintaining ATP level reduced the FRET level to 0.2 (Figure 6B). There were no reiterative FRET changes and the Cy3 signal subsequently disappeared, representing dissociation of the translocated strand. Accordingly, the number of Cy3 spots in the imaging area decreased rapidly (Figure 6F, green circle). These results show that HIM-6 progressively and fully unwound the FK-50(D31) substrate in the presence of CeRPA. As a control, the addition of CeRPA alone, without HIM-6, to the FK-50(D31) substrate did not cause any FRET changes and resulted in minimal decrease in the number of Cy3 spots (Supplementary Figure S3C and D). Analyses of the dy-

namics of HIM-6/CeRPA-mediated unwinding of the FK50(D0) substrate revealed that several reiterative unwinding cycles occurred before the full separation of DNA (Figure 6C), representing the time required for CeRPA proteins to cover the unwound strands. These results suggest that CeRPA proteins assemble on the unwound ssDNA region as HIM-6 unwinds the DNA and moves forward, preventing the DNA from reannealing and/or preventing HIM-6 from sliding back, resulting in processive, full unwinding of the duplex. Interestingly, the inducing effect on processive unwinding was specific for CeRPA because E. coli SSB did not induce the full separation of FK-50(D31) and FK50(D0), but only interfered with the reiterative unwinding behavior (Figure 6F, purple circle; Supplementary Figure S3E and F).
Next, the order in which the proteins were added to the reaction was changed. The FK-50(D31) substrate was first incubated with 20 nM CeRPA and then, after washing away unbound CeRPA, 30 nM HIM-6 and 100 M ATP were added. Notably, similar to what was observed in the above experiment, the FRET efficiency dropped rapidly to 0.4, followed by dissociation of the translocated strand (Figure 6D). The number of Cy3 spots in the imaging area also decreased, but at a slower rate than when CeRPA was present in solution (Figure 6F, orange circle). When CeRPA was preloaded to FK-50(D0) and flushed out before unwinding was initiated with HIM-6, HIM-6 fully unwound the substrate in one cycle (Figure 6E). These results are intriguing because there was no CeRPA available to protect the newly exposed unwound ssDNA region, but HIM-6 was still able to fully unwind the DNA. It is possible that there is direct interaction between HIM-6 and CeRPA, which was previously observed in a human system (22). HIM-6 loaded at the forked junction may bind preloaded CeRPA, and these proteins may translocate together while unwinding the DNA. These results suggest that CeRPA plays a crucial role in switching HIM-6 between the reiterative and processive unwinding modes, thereby regulating the processing of long DNAs.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we addressed the key molecular characteristics of reiterative DNA unwinding by the C. elegans BLM helicase HIM-6. We found that HIM-6 unwinds 25-31 bp by translocating in the 3 -5 direction from the ss/dsDNA junction of forked DNA substrates, and then returns along the same translocated strand via rapid backsliding. This cycle of unwinding and rewinding occurs in a highly repetitive fashion, but long duplex DNAs are not fully unwound. The reiterative unwinding process transitions into unidirectional unwinding in the presence of CeRPA, thereby allowing full unwinding of long duplex DNA substrates.
Several RecQ family helicases are able to reiteratively unwind DNA (5,6,9-11). However, it has remained unclear how far the helicases translocate along the DNA before turning back. A previous smFRET study by Yodh et al. suggested that human BLM unwinds fewer than 34 bp of forked DNA substrates (5). In that study, the unwound DNA length was estimated by comparing the unwinding times and chances of full unzipping for DNA

substrates of varying lengths. Another study of BLM by Wang and colleagues observed unwinding-rewinding cycles on DNA hairpins using magnetic tweezers and estimated the unwound DNA length to be 15 bp (6). Other studies with magnetic tweezers have shown that human WRN and AtRecQ2 reiteratively unwind DNA hairpins containing a stem region of 40-50 bp (9,10). However, these studies have not directly shown how many base pairs separate, making it difficult to determine how the returning position is distributed. Our smFRET measurements of DNA substrates with internal labels at varying positions revealed that HIM-6 returns at a narrowly distributed position between the 25th and 31st nt. To our knowledge, the current study is the first direct identification of the returning position of a RecQ family helicase showing reiterative unwinding. Our findings raise the question of how RecQ helicases precisely sense the unwound DNA length and change their mode of dynamics accordingly.
It has long been of interest to identify which strand RecQ helicase uses for moving backward. Three possible modes have been proposed: (i) strand-switching and active translocation along the displaced strand, (ii) strand-switching and sliding back along the displaced strand and (iii) sliding back along the translocated strand without strand-switching. Different mechanisms have been proposed for different RecQ helicases. The `strand-switching and translocation' mode, in which the helicase switches strands after unwinding the DNA duplex and translocates along the displaced strand in an ATP-dependent manner, has been suggested for human BLM (5). However, a later study of human BLM using DNA hairpins suggested the `strand-switching and sliding back' mode, in which the helicase returns by passively sliding along the displaced strand (6). A study of AtRECQ2, a WRN homolog, also proposed the `strandswitching and sliding back' mode (10). More recently, human WRN and Gallus gallus (chicken) WRN were shown to follow the third mode of `sliding back along the translocated strand' (11). Notably, a recent study of E. coli RecQ proposed that either the `strand-switching' or `sliding back' mode is possible, depending on the involvement of the HRDC domain (23). If HIM-6 follows the first two models, the cycle of repetitive unwinding would depend on the length of the 5 ssDNA tail of the forked substrates. However, our results revealed that the waiting time depends on the length of the 3 ssDNA tail, but not the 5 ssDNA tail (Figure 4), providing no support for the first two models.
Our experiments using partial duplex DNA substrates without a 5 tail further support the third mode of `sliding back along the translocated strand'. If HIM-6 were to switch to the displaced strand to translocate or slide back, and then switch back to the translocated strand, it would spend a certain amount of time at the end of the displaced strand for strand-switching, during which the FRET level would not revert to its original FRET level (Figure 5A). However, our results showed that the FRET level immediately returned to its original high level at the end of the rewinding stage, which does not support the existence of such strand-switching steps. If HIM-6 were to slide back on the translocated strand without strand-switching, these behaviors can be coherently explained. The rewinding mode appears not to be influenced by the structure of DNA sub-

strates because our data revealed consistent, reiterative unwinding behavior on several kinds of DNA substrates containing overhang, flap, or fork structure, and the rewinding time was measured to be in the same range. Transition to the rewinding mode could be explained by either the interaction of RecQ helicase with DNA or a conformational change in the protein. Most RecQ helicases have three conserved domains: the helicase domain, RecQ C-terminal (RQC) domain and HRDC domain. A previous study of human BLM using DNA hairpins proposed that the RQC domain interacts with the DNA substrate (6). In this model, BLM uses its helicase domain to bind to the translocated strand, and the RQC domain to bind to both the dsDNA and the displaced strand during unwinding. When the helicase domain is released from the translocated strand, the enzyme switches strands and slides back quickly along the displaced strand. These interactions of RecQ domains with DNA have been demonstrated for BLM and may explain the `strand-switching' model (24). On the other hand, as a possible explanation of the `sliding back on the translocated strand' model, a study of E. coli RecQ proposed that the HRDC domain plays a role in DNA interaction (23). If the HRDC domain binds to the displaced strand, the tethered helicase may slide back along the translocated strand after unwinding a certain length of the duplex. In this case, the extent of HRDC-tethered backsliding is probably limited by the length and flexibility of the linker region connecting the RQC and HRDC domains. If the HRDC domain binds to the helicase core (consisting of the helicase and RQC domains), the interaction between the helicase and the translocated strand will allow RecQ to slide toward the 3 end of the translocated strand, resulting in rapid reannealing. An interaction of the HRDC domain with the helicase core was recently demonstrated for human BLM (25).
A similar mechanism of controlling the DNA unwinding dynamics by conformational changes has been described for other kinds of helicases. Rep, PcrA and UvrD helicases spontaneously transition between a `closed' conformation, which actively unwinds DNA, and an `open' conformation, which reverses to rezip the DNA, and binding partner proteins can selectively stabilize the open conformation to promote processive unwinding (26,27). Since RecQ members belonging to the same family use distinct mechanisms, it remains to be elucidated how the domains of RecQ helicases interplay to control the translocating and unwinding dynamics of the proteins. Although structural information about HIM-6 is currently unavailable, the detailed mechanism of unwinding used by HIM-6 could be elucidated by experiments using modified HIM-6 to identify the domains involved in each stage of reiterative unwinding motion.
Because the reiterative unwinding behavior of RecQ helicases has been observed using purified recombinant proteins, it is still unclear whether such behavior actually occurs in the cellular environment. Helicases interact with many different kinds of proteins; thus it is of interest to determine if partner proteins can change the reiterative unwinding into processive, unidirectional unwinding. Our results showed that CeRPA changes the behavior of HIM-6 from reiterative unwinding into processive unwinding, allowing it to completely unwind a 50 bp duplex DNA (Figure 6). Also, a longer substrate, FK-60, was completely unwound by HIM-

6 in the presence of CeRPA (Supplementary Figure S2H- J). This finding is in contrast to what has been observed for human BLM, which persistently showed reiterative unwinding in the presence of hRPA (5). However, a recent study of human WRN found that the interaction of multiple hRPAs enables WRN to unwind dsDNA unidirectionally for longer than 1 kbp (9). Although a direct, physical interaction of HIM-6 with CeRPA has not been demonstrated, we speculate that the processive unwinding observed here must be due to their direct interaction. Our observation that preloaded CeRPA induces the full separation of the DNA substrate by HIM-6 in the absence of free CeRPA proteins to cover the unwound DNA strands strongly supports that their interaction persists while HIM-6 unwinds the DNA. Combined with earlier observations, processive unwinding of HIM-6 stimulated by CeRPA implies a universal role of RPA in generating a long ssDNA region, which is possibly involved in DNA repair processes. Together with the ability of RecQ helicases to sense the length of unwound DNA, these results provide clues as to how RecQ helicases decide and control the mode of translocation and length of DNA to unwind.

SOME POINTS IN TRACHEOTOMY.
By DAVID FOULIS, M.D., Glasgow.
(Read at the Southern Medical Society, 13th January, 1881.)
When my friend Dr. Carr requested me to read a paper here, it occurred to me that there were one or two points in connection with the operation of tracheotomy which might fairly be discussed by the Society. The members are familiar with the description of it given in books, and many of those present have no doubt performed this operation repeatedly. It would be superfluous therefore for me to attempt to recapitulate the whole modus operandi in this place, but it may perhaps be permitted to me to refer to some of the difficulties which I have myself met with, and to invite an expression of opinion on those points where improvement appears possible.
In the course of my practice, I have had occasion to open the air tube twenty-three times for very varied diseases; but I will
restrict my remarks here to those cases in which the trachea
was the seat of the incision, and leave out of account nine cases in which the opening was purposely made above the cricoid cartilage. This leaves fourteen cases of tracheotomy.
First then, as to the fatality of the operation. I may say that in no case could death be traced to the operation. Six of the cases were for diphtheria; one for laryngeal phthisis; three for acute inflammation and swelling of the mucous membrane lining the larynx; three for extreme stenosis, owing to old standing laryngeal inflammation ; and one for almost complete closure of the larynx by intralaryngeal papillomata in a child 2J years old. Four of the cases of diphtheria died of the disease at varying periods, but with the breathing relieved and death rendered more peaceful. Another case recovered from the immediate danger of the diphtheritic attack, so far as to permit of the removal of the tube and the closure of the wound, but sank two months after the operation from cardiac syncope, probably one of the paralytic after effects of the disease. The last of the six cases of diphtheria made a perfect recovery, the tube being removed in a fortnight. The case of laryngeal phthisis was tided over the immediate danger of suffocation, and only ended fatally a year after the operation
from extension of the disease. The three cases of acute
inflammation and swelling of the mucous membrane of the larynx made excellent recoveries, and were able to dispense with the tube within a month after the operation. The three

120

cases of chronic thickening were in elderly people, and they, too, rallied well after the tracheotomy, but in them the tube
continued to be worn. One of them succumbed to diabetes
several months after the tracheotomy; the other two are alive and in comfort as regards the breathing. Lastly, the little boy whose larynx was occupied by intralaryngeal growths is well and strong, and though the tube is still in (one year after the operation), I have been able to remove a number of the papillomata from the larynx, and there is a fair prospect of our being able to dispense with the tube soon.
I have thought it right to mention briefly the cases which, owing to the kindness of medical friends, have been sent to me; but of course I do not bring forward the statistics of so small a number of cases from any belief in their novelty or importance, but rather to show that my remarks have at all
events a certain basis of observation.
The first point to which I would draw attention is the size of the tube to be used at different ages. This is particularly important in the operation on very young children, but is not beneath attention even in adults. The youngest patient on my list was a female child, aged 6 months, who, four days before I saw her, had " caught cold." The symptoms at first were very slight, but a certain amount of dyspnoea set in, and gradually increased to such an extent as to alarm her attendants. Active treatment by calomel and tartar emetic and local blood-letting failing to give relief, I was asked to perform tracheotomy. When I saw the child (10 p.m., 11th November, 1879), it was in an agonizing state of dyspnoea; the skin was pale and clammy, the lips pale blue in tint; at each inspiration the eyebrows rose and the forehead wrinkled, and the supraclavicular and lateral costal regions sank in; while the noisy inspiration and expiration indicated advanced stenosis of the larynx. There was no membrane on the fauces, nor any suspicion of diphtheria; and the diagnosis of simple acute laryngitis appeared to be quite clear. No time was to be lost, as the child was fast becoming exhausted, and, therefore, Dr. Lothian put her under the influence of chloroform, and I cut down on the trachea. At this early age the trachea is a very small and soft tube, not easily distinguishable by the finger, so delicate are its rings; and the larynx, too, is soft and yielding. I therefore selected the most resistant point of the air tube as my guide?namely, the cricoid ring, which gave me a clear clue to the position of the upper end of the trachea. Exposing this, I divided the first four rings, and, of course, the isthmus of the thyroid gland. Then arose the

121

doubt as to the propriety of putting in the smallest tracheal
tube which I had been able to procure. Some observations of
my own,* and the published measurements of M. Marc S^e,*f" had taught me that the diameter of the trachea at birth is not
more than 4 mm. or 5 mm., and that for several months after

birth this size is not much altered. Now, my smallest tube
measured 5 mm. external diameter at the point. This would have completely filled the trachea, and, I thought, might cause
erosion if the tube were to remain in for any time. I con-
tented myself with the introduction of the smaller inner tube, the diameter of which was 4 mm.; and, as soon as possible, I had a tube made by a silversmith, with an outside diameter of 4 mm. This new tube (Fig. 1) was made of equal diameter throughout, 01 solid silver, and very plain pattern. At the suggestion of the patient's father, the inner tube was made to project a little at the front, in order to facilitate its removal for cleaning; and all loops and hooks were omitted. I was delighted with this tube (Fig. 1); it was easily worked, and to the nurse and mother of the patient it presented not the least difficulty. The diameter of the inner tube, small as it was?3 mm.?gave ample room for respiration; and the recovery of the child went on uninterruptedly. Thirty-two days after the operation the tube was finally removed, and the small wound allowed to heal. Unfortunately, about ten days after the wound had healed up, the baby caught cold again, pneumonia set in, and, in a few days, she died; but the operation may be fairly claimed as quite successful.
In March, 1880, another case cf simple acute laryngitis in a female child, ret. 17 months, with excessive dyspnoea, occurred in the practice of Dr. John Wilson, who asked me to see her. We decided on tracheotomy, which I performed in the same
way as in the other case, my incision passing through the
isthmus of the thyroid gland. The same 4 mm. tube was used, and the patient made an excellent recovery, ample breathing space being given by the 3 mm. lumen of the inner tube. Following up the idea of carefully adapting the size of
the tube to the individual case, I have had a set of five silver

tubes made, graduated according to the measurements of the
trachea at different ages, so that one may be able to select, without hesitation, a tube which is sure to fit the individual
case, from birth onwards to adult age. I say from birth
onwards, for a case of an unusually interesting kind has come under my notice, in which the propriety of tracheotomy at this

hours after birth.* Every sort of sedative treatment was tried, and failed; and the question of tracheotomy was raised only to be negatived. But, bearing in view the facts that three children of the same parents had previously succumbed to laryngismus shortly after birth, and that a post-mortem examination of
the child which I attended failed to reveal any disease or
abnormality of the larynx, we have agreed that, in the event of another delivery being followed by laryngismus in the child, the apparently severe measure of tracheotomy is not to be shirked, and to this the parents have given their approval. The success of the operation in the child set. 6 months (above detailed) leads me to think that a favourable result may be got even in the newly bora.
lhe curve 01 the tubes is a wide one, in order to avoid that
ulceration of the anterior wall of the trachea which often
follows the use of the ordinary over-curved tubes. These tubes are sold by W. B. Hilliard & Sons, 65 Renfield Street.
Another interesting detail in performing tracheotomy is the exact seat of election for the opening in the windpipe. In books we have a tradition handed down informing us that the windpipe may be opened either above or below the isthmus of the thyroid gland; and hemorrhage is alluded to as an event
to be dreaded if the isthmus be cut. But some of the best
authorities (Erichsen, Bryant, and others), while still advising us to leave the isthmus alone if possible, say that it may be cut without scruple when necessary. And it is not difficult to understand why this should be done; for in the isthmus in the middle line there are no blood-vessels, just as in the tongue or in the perineum the middle line is devoid of vessels of more than capillary size. Hyrtl failed to inject the one side of the thyroid trom the other through the isthmus, it is quite true, indeed, .that the thyroid arteries, ramifying outside the capsule of the thyroid body send small branches across the trachea to anastomose with those of the opposite side, but these vessels are quite outside of the isthmus, and do not belong to it. In many cases, especially in young children, and people with short necks, the space between the cricoid and the isthmus is so very small that no tube could be got in without dislodging the isthmus or incising the cricoid, and as a matter of fact, I believe the isthmus is often cut unawares in children. But in the fear of the isthmus, which young and even more experienced surgeons are imbued with, serious mistakes are made. I have been called twice to make post-mortem examinations of children dying of diphtheria, in whom the so-called

high operation has been done by surgeons who certainly could not be called quite inexperienced. In one of these cases the tube was pushed into the larynx at the base of the epiglottis; and in the other it had gone into the pouch of Morgagni. On the other hand, by going too low down, we come into serious dangers. The thick plexus of thyroid veins; the occasional thyroidea ima; and even the innominate itself may give trouble: while the bulky thymus in children, though not dangerous to cut, comes more or less in the way. It occurred to me, therefore, after doing one or two tracheotomies, and after carefully dissecting the parts in a number of bodies at various ages, both injected and uninjected, to select the isthmus
as the safest seat of the incision. To this I was the more
impelled by watching the results of cutting the cricoid cartil-
age. It does not answer to cut the cricoid, lor there is so
much spring in the ring of the cricoid that the tube cannot be worn without a constant irritation, it may be unfelt, but steadily leading to perichondritis and necrosis of parts of the cartilage. Twice I have tried to obviate this by removing a piece of the cricoid in cases where it was intended to wear the tube permanently: and this proved very successful. But, in merely splitting the cricoid, the result is not good if a tube is
to be worn even for a week or two. In another case, that of a
female, set. 34, with acute infraglottic oedema, under the care of Dr. Sloan, I performed the low operation, but during it I had so much profuse haemorrhage from the thyroid plexus of veins that I resolved to go higher up, and incised through the isthmus, with the best results. In the last five or six cases I have cut through the isthmus with the knife, and have had
reason to be well satisfied with the easy access to the trachea
and absence of haemorrhage during the operation. Any haemorrhage which is met with at this part of the air tube is from small arterial vessels which are readily secured by ligature or pressure forceps, and that gushing of blood from large and swollen veins in the thyroid plexus is avoided. The trachea is near the surface, and we have the useful guide of the firm resistant ring of the cricoid at the upper end of our incision, which, in very young children especially, is of considerable
value.
The incision in the skin may reach from the level of the
cricothyroid membrane to a point half way towards the suprasternal notch; and, in dissecting deeper, it is wise to use two pairs of dissecting forceps, one of which is held by the operator, and the other by the assistant; so that, with these, the tissue to be cut is steadily held on both sides before each

cut is made. Vessels are secured as they appear. Keeping in the middle line, the isthmus may be cut and the trachea exposed and, all bleeding being stopped, incised either with or without the aid of a hook to steady it. In inserting the tube, the point of the dissecting forceps is placed in the cut in the trachea, and the tube pushed along between the blades which open the trachea as the tube advances. No complicated instruments are needed, nor split tubes. A thin tenotomy knife, several artery compressors, a sharp hook, and two pairs of dissecting forceps are all the necessary instruments.
The tube once in, the after treatment is easy. No steaming is needed. If a single layer of dry gauze is loosely thrown over the face and neck, the air will be kept warm and moist
enough for all purposes. It cannot be a good thing for a
patient to have a chill fog playing over an open tracheotomy wound; and this is what happens when steam is blown even out of a hot kettle into the air over the patient. I prefer to have the patient near the fire, out of draughts, but with abundance of fresh air; and, therefore, without any tent of
blankets over the bed.
One other detail I may mention, rather in explanation than as belonging to the operative procedure.
It may perhaps have been remarked that I have not used the word croup as applying to any of my cases. I have avoided it purposely; for it appears to me that the word croup is applicable to a symptom rather than to a disease or a pathological condition. Croup, so far as I can discover, means a hoarse cough with difficulty of respiration; and as this symptom may be caused by a variety of pathological conditions, I have preferred to state what in my opinion was the
disease in each case. It seems to me to resemble very much
the use of the word cough, which may be a symptom 01 several diseases : and just as we talk of pneumonia, bronchitis, &c., &c., all of which may cause cough, so we may talk of diphtheria, acute simple laryngitis, &c., &c., which may give
rise to croup. That there is any one distinct disease to which
the word croup can be fairly limited I do not believe; for, on the post-mortem table, according to my experience and reading, it always resolves itself into one or other of well recognised pathological conditions of the air tube. It is a useful word in a clinical sense, however, just as the word cough is also.

Understanding Gastric Cancer Risk Factors: We Need to Close the Gap
Joo Ha Hwang
Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA

See "Knowledge Gaps among Physicians Caring for Multiethnic Populations at Increased Gastric Cancer Risk" by Shailja C. Shah, et al. on page 38, Vol. 12. No. 1, 2018

Gastric cancer is the fifth most common malignancy worldwide; however, the incidence of gastric cancer in the United States is relatively low at 7.3 per 100,000 in 2017 accounting for only 1.7% of new cancer cases in the United States.1 Given this low incidence, most medical providers in the United States, including gastroenterologists, do not fully understand the risk factors for gastric cancer and do not realize that there are highrisk populations in the United States that would benefit from screening for gastric cancer. In this issue of Gut and Liver, Shah et al.2 publish a report that evaluates the knowledge gaps of physicians on the topic of risk factors for gastric cancer. The authors performed an internet-based survey of physicians (primary care providers and gastroenterologist) in New York City, which included a knowledge assessment of gastric cancer risk factors followed by three clinical vignettes. This study highlights the current gaps in knowledge of physicians who theoretically should be the most knowledgeable about the risk factors for gastric cancer since the population that they care for has the highest population of immigrants from high incidence areas. In a nutshell, this study demonstrates the need to educate all physicians regarding the risk factors for gastric cancer. Primary care physicians need further education on risk factors such as ethnicity and Helicobacter pylori infection and which patients should be referred for gastric cancer screening. Gastroenterologists need further education on all risk factors including ethnicity and H. pylori infection as well as the significance of gastric intestinal metaplasia and how it should be surveyed. As the paper demonstrates in one of its vignettes, many gastroenterologists do not realize that gastric intestinal metaplasia in a patient from a high incidence region should have endoscopic surveillance.

There are many issues that remain unresolved when it comes to gastric cancer screening in the United States. Although Japan and Korea have demonstrated gastric cancer screening to be cost-effective and have a mortality benefit, these issues have yet to be adequately addressed for high-risk populations in the United States. With a lack of data regarding the benefits of gastric cancer screening for high-risk populations in the United States, only weak recommendations exist by a single U.S. medical society, the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, suggesting "screening EGD for gastric cancer in new U.S. immigrants from high-risk regions around the world, such as Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and South America, especially if there is a family history of gastric cancer in a first-degree relative."3 In addition, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) suggests surveillance esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for patients with gastric intestinal metaplasia if they are thought to be at increased risk for developing gastric cancer due to ethnicity or family history.4
As physicians in the United States, we need to remember that the United States continues to have a significant immigrant population from area with a high incidence of gastric cancer. Gastric cancer in particular is a disease that occurs disproportionately higher in certain immigrant populations from high incidence regions of the world as mentioned previously. This is probably one of the most significant unaddressed healthcare disparities in the United States.5 Another fact that highlights this disparity is that guidelines for esophageal cancer screening and Barrett's esophagus are well established in the United States; although, the incidence of esophageal cancer is much lower than gastric cancer in the United States (16,940 vs 28,000 in 2017,

respectively).1,6,7 It makes sense that high-risk groups for gastric cancer should undergo screening, especially if the countries that they have immigrated from have national guidelines for gastric cancer screening such as Korea and Japan. However, questions regarding how gastric cancer screening should be performed in the United States for these high-risk populations remain. We previously proposed an algorithm for gastric cancer screening in the United States with EGD in high-risk patients followed by surveillance for patients found to have H. pylori infection, atrophic gastritis, and/or intestinal metaplasia; however, this algorithm was only a suggestion based on an extensive review of the literature, incorporating recommendations by the ASGE.8 Additional data regarding the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this or any other algorithm proposed for gastric cancer screening will be needed for implementation and insurance coverage as a screening test.
Fortunately, interest in diagnosing early gastric cancer has been increasing in the United States, partially due to the increasing interest and developing expertise in endoscopic submucosal dissection in the United States. With this increasing interest in diagnosing early gastric cancer, it provides us with an opportunity to further educate gastroenterologist in the United States regarding this significant healthcare disparity. The study by Shah et al.2 provides us with important data that will help guide us on the specific topics that physicians require further education regarding risk factors for gastric cancer. The eventual goals should be for physicians to be able to identify patients who are at high risk for gastric cancer and to establish guidelines for gastric cancer screening for these patients in the United States and throughout the world.

TRACK: AESTHETIC Abdominal Plication & Postoperative Venous Thromboembolic Events Following Abdominal Body Contouring: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis
Presenter: Fei Wang, BA
Co-Authors: Katherine Chemakin, BS, Peter Shamamian, Jr, BS, Isha Punn, BS, Tessa Campbell, MD, Joseph A. Ricci, MD
Affiliation: Montefiore Medical Center, The Bronx, NY
PURPOSE: Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) such as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are rare but potentially devastating complications of abdominal body contouring procedures. With an incidence of around 1%, the VTE rate in these surgeries is significantly lower than that of other surgical specialties but remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.1, 2 Rectus abdominis plication, a commonly utilized method to reduce diastasis width, has been associated with increased intraabdominal pressure.3-5 Though concerns that this increased intra-abdominal pressure may lead to increased DVTs and subsequent PEs exist, there is a lack of literature investigating associations between the two in abdominal contouring procedures and we aim to bridge this gap in knowledge.
METHOD: A retrospective review was conducted for all patients who underwent abdominal body contouring procedures at Montefiore Medical Center between 2010 and 2020. Cases were defined as patients who experienced a postoperative venous thromboembolic event and were matched to controls in a 1:4 ratio using the propensity score matching technique. Patient factors of note included demographic data, operative details, ASA, Charlson comorbidity index, and Caprini scores. Postoperative complications were collected for all patients. Parametric, nonparametric, and multivariable regression modeling was utilized for analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1192 patients underwent abdominal contouring procedures, 19 (1.59%) experienced a postoperative venous thromboembolic event and were matched to 76 controls. The overall cohort was 92.6% female (n=88) with the average age, Charlson comorbidity index, BMI, and operative time being 44.99 year, 1.38 point, 30.25 units, and 284.69 minutes, respectively. Mean BMI differed

significantly between cases and controls (32.1 vs. 29.8, p=0.046); and cases were more likely to have a prior history of cerebrovascular events (OR: 3.45, p=0.026). Additionally, patients with postoperative VTEs were more likely to have received intraoperative blood transfusions (OR: 13.88, p=0.005). Postoperatively, cases had significantly longer lengths of stay (6.21 vs. 1.21, p=0.006) and a much longer duration of chemophylaxis (6.05 vs. 1.46, p=0.015). Cases were significantly more likely to experience concurrent complications including infection, delayed wound healing, and umbilical necrosis (p<0.001, p=0.044, p=0.044 respectively). Plication was not associated with VTE outcomes.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that abdominal plication does not increases the risk of VTEs after controlling for potentially predisposing factors via propensity score matching. However, in patients who do experience VTEs, further caution must be exercised as there is an increased likelihood of concurrent complications that may further complicate the postoperative course.

PURPOSE: Symptomatic neuromas can be debilitating and hinder quality of life. Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) is increasingly being employed to prevent or treat neuromas and phantom limb pain in amputee patients. We previously reported successful pain outcomes in a small cohort of nonamputee patients with symptomatic neuromas who underwent TMR. We now have 2.5 years of experience with this procedure. The goal of this study is to evaluate the patientreported outcomes and complications of using TMR to treat symptomatic neuromas in nonamputee patients.
METHOD: A retrospective review was conducted of patients with symptomatic neuromas treated with TMR from January 2019 to October 2021 at a single institution. Patients' medical records were reviewed to identify neuroma characteristics, TMR details, and postoperative followup. Neuromas were excised to healthy nerve fascicles and a redundant donor motor fascicle was selected for nerve transfer. Phone surveys were conducted to evaluate pain frequency and severity, physical function, and quality of life before and after TMR. Pain severity, physical function, and quality of life were assessed on a scale of 0 to 10. Pain frequency was based on number of times per day and number of days per week patients experienced pain. Statistical analysis was performed to compare pre- and postoperative scores, with statistical significance defined at values of p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Thirty patients were identified. Average age and body mass index were 52.4 years and 33.7kg/m2, respectively. Fifteen patients (50%) had undergone a prior neuroma excision. Neuromas were located in the lower extremity (n=17, 56.7%), upper extremity (n=8, 26.7%), and trunk (n=5, 16.7%). At mean follow-up of 11.1 months (range 1.9 to 24.1 months), pain frequency decreased from 6.8 days per week to 4.7 (p<0.001) and from 9.2 times per day to 6.1 (p<0.001). Average pain severity decreased from 8.4/10 to 5.5/10 (p<0.001). Overall physical function increased from 3.6/10 to 5.8/10 (p=0.004) and overall quality of life increased from 4.2/10 to 6.2/10 (p=0.002).
CONCLUSION: TMR is a promising surgical treatment for symptomatic neuromas. Our study cohort benefited from decreased pain, improved physical functioning, and

better quality of life. Larger studies are warranted to further elucidate the advantages of TMR in non-amputee patients with symptomatic neuromas.

PURPOSE: The number of aesthetic surgery procedures performed in the United States has consistently grown over the past several decades, with the most recent annual expenditures totaling over $9 billion. Despite this increasing demand, plastic surgery residency programs have found it challenging to provide comprehensive training in aesthetic surgery to fulfill ACGME requirements (150 aesthetic procedures). Prior studies evaluating institutional experiences in resident aesthetic clinics have been limited by sample size. Here we present our experience with productivity and efficiency of a resident aesthetic clinic at the NYU Hansjrg Wyss Department of Plastic Surgery and highlight its potential impact on the competency of graduating plastic surgery residents.
METHOD: We performed a retrospective chart review of all adult surgical patients who presented to the NYU Aesthetic Surgery Clinic in 2021. Patient demographics, comorbidities, consultation/procedural data, and postoperative complications were used to generate descriptive statistics using SPSS Statistics. Conversion rate (the number of consults which subsequently underwent a procedure), as well as complication and revision rates were calculated. Cases were indicated, performed and followed postoperatively by residents with dedicated attending surgical supervision and anesthesia care.
RESULTS: A total of 407 consultations (380 patients) met inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Of these, 171 consultations underwent a procedure (42% conversion rate) and 464 distinct surgical procedures were performed. Patients were predominantly female (94.5%) and in relatively good health (3.9% diabetes, 6.6% active smokers). The cohort had an average age and BMI of 49.3 +/- 13.6 years and 27.1 +/- 5.2kg/m2, respectively. Face and neck procedures (55.8%) accounted for the majority, followed by breast (22.2%) and body contouring (22.0%). The most common

Abstract
Following initial success in melanoma and lung tumours, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are now well recognized as a major immunotherapy treatment modality for multiple types of solid cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), the small subset that is mismatch-repair-deficient and microsatellite-instability-high (dMMR/MSI-H) derive benefit from immunotherapy; however, the vast majority of patients with proficient MMR (pMMR) or with microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC do not. Immunoscore and the consensus molecular subtype classifications are promising biomarkers in predicting therapeutic efficacy in selected CRC. In pMRR/MSS CRC, biomarkers are also needed to understand the molecular mechanisms governing immune reactivity and to predict their relationship to treatment. The continuous development of such biomarkers would offer new perspectives and more personalized treatments by targeting oncological options, including ICIs, which modify the tumour-immune microenvironment. In this review, we focus on CRC and discuss the current status of ICIs, the role of biomarkers to predict response to immunotherapy, and the approaches being explored to render pMMR/MSS CRC more immunogenic through the use of combined therapies.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer in women and the third most common in men. Despite advances in the diagnosis and management of this disease, CRC remains the fifth cause of cancer-related death in women and the fourth cause in men [1]. Moreover, the global CRC burden is expected to increase by 60% by 2030 [2].

The immune system distinguishes self from non-self through the binding of T-cell receptors (TCR) on T-cells to complexes of peptides with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules presented on the surface of all cells, including tumour cells [3, 4]. Recognition of peptide-MHC class I complexes by the TCR alone is insufficient for T-cell activation. TCR-MHC signalling pathways are modulated by co-stimulatory

or co-inhibitory signals, which tumour cells exploit to escape destruction [5, 6]. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a type of immunotherapy often made from antibodies. ICIs target co-inhibitory receptors, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on T-cells and other immune-cell subpopulations, or their ligands, such as programmed cell death protein 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumour cells and various immune cells. Over the past decade, ICIs have revolutionized the field of oncology through demonstrated clinical efficacy in several cancers, including melanoma and nonsmall-cell lung cancer. To date, other inhibitory receptors such as lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), T-cell immunoglobulin (Ig) mucin 3 (TIM-3), T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), and activating receptors such as the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, member 4 (OX40), the glucocorticoidinduced TNFR-related protein, the inductible T-cell costimulator, and CD40 have been identified and are currently evaluated as targets of monoclonal antibodies in different clinical trials [7].
In CRC, it has been shown that only patients with the subset of mismatch-repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high (dMMR/MSI-H) tumours are likely to respond to treatment with ICIs [8-10]. This subset is characterized by an increased number of tumour mutations [11] due to inactivation of one of the four mismatch-repair (MMR) genes: MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, and PMS2 [12-15]. In 12% of CRC cases, epigenetic changes cause sporadic dMMR/MSI-H, in particular methylation of the MLH1 promoter. While, in 3% of CRC cases, dMMR/MSI-H is due to germ-line MMR mutation (Lynch syndrome) [16]. In 2017, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the anti-PD-1 inhibitors pembrolizumab (KeytrudaVR , Merck) and nivolumab (OpdivoVR , Bristol-Myers Squibb) for the treatment of patients with dMMR/ MSI-H CRC, but the European Medicines Agency is still waiting for the results of phase III randomized-controlled studies.
Unlike dMMR/MSI-H CRC patients, ICIs alone provide limited to no clinical benefit in CRC patients with proficient MMR or microsatellite stable (pMMR/MSS) tumours [8]. For these patients, ICIs are being actively explored in combination with treatments that aim to increase the intra-tumoural immune response and render the tumour `immune-reactive'. In this review, we discuss the current use of ICIs in CRC, the role of biomarkers to predict CRC response to immunotherapy, and approaches currently under investigation to render pMMR/MSS CRC more immunogenic through the use of combined therapies.
Immunotherapy in CRC: current status
Ipilimumab (YervoyVR , Bristol-Myers Squibb) is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CTLA-4 protein receptor to activate the immune system [17-21]. Its rapid success, and that of monoclonal antibodies against PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 [22-25], led to the active investigation of ICIs in all cancer types. In the initial trials, which included patients with unselected metastatic CRC (mCRC), only three out of >100 patients with treatment-refractory mCRC experienced a partial or complete response following anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment [23, 26-28]. Retrospectively, it was found that all responders harboured dMMR/MSI-H tumours. Most of these tumours foster an immunogenic microenvironment characterized by a high overall mutation burden (>12 mutations per 106 DNA bases), associated tumour neoantigens and T helper 1 (Th1) cytotoxic immune response with upregulation of PD-1/PD-L1-positive cells [29-33]. Based on the observed impressive tumour response, enthusiasm for immunotherapy in CRC grew and several studies investigated the therapeutic potential of PD-1 inhibitors.

Le and colleagues reported the results of a phase II proof-ofconcept study (KEYNOTE-016) of dMMR/MSI-H tumours treated with pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) [8]. In this trial, which included 41 patients with dMMR/MSI-H and pMMR/MSS chemorefractory mCRC and dMMR/MSI-high non-CRC patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was 40% (4 of 10 patients). Clinically durable responses were observed in patients with dMMR/MSI-H mCRC, whereas no response (ORR  0%) was observed in those with pMMR/MSS mCRC (0/18). Treatment was well tolerated overall, but 17 of 41 patients experienced a grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse event (TRAE). The updated results of this trial, which included 86 dMMR/MSI-H cancers, confirmed an ORR of 53%, with 21% complete responses. In CRC, objective responses were observed in 52% of patients [34]. The 2-year overall survival (OS) rate was 64% for these highly pretreated cancers [34].
CheckMate-142, a multicohort non-randomized phase II study, evaluated the efficacy and safety of nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) in combination with ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 3 or 6 weeks), or nivolumab as a single agent in previously treated or treatment-nai쮟e dMMR/MSI-H mCRC [9, 10, 35]. The results of this study confirmed the impressive treatment benefit of these drugs in this setting. In chemorefractory mCRC patients, the ORR for nivolumab monotherapy (n  74) was 31% and for the nivolumab/ipilimumab combination (n  119) it was 55%; 1-year OS rates were 73.4% and 85%, respectively [9, 10]. In treatmentnai쮟e patients, the corresponding ORR and 1-year OS rates for first-line patients treated with the combination regimen (n  45) were 60% and 83%, respectively [10]. With >2 years of follow-up at the time of reporting, the median OS of all cohorts had not been reached. Grade 3-4 TRAEs were higher in the combination regimen (32%) except for the cohort that received combined therapy with low-dose ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 6 weeks). In these patients, grade 3-4 TRAEs were 16%, suggesting that the low-dose combination is the best treatment regimen in this setting. Efficacy of nivolumab and ipilimumab combination was also recently reported in the preoperative setting. In this ongoing study, authors preliminarily reported that a short preoperative treatment (6 weeks) with ipilimumab (1 mg/kg, day 1) plus nivolumab (3 mg/kg, day 1, 15) in non-metastatic colon cancer was safe and led to major pathological response (2% of residual vital tumour cells) in all dMMR/MSI-H tumours (seven of seven patients) [36]. No sign of pathological response (85%-100% of residual vital tumour cells) was observed in the eight patients with pMMR/MSS CRC tumours.
Several randomized phase III trials are currently ongoing in dMMR/MSI-H mCRC to evaluate the efficacy of anti-PD-1, antiPD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4 either combined with or compared to chemotherapy and with or without targeted therapy [37]. However, dMMR/MSI-H status, well recognized for its favourable prognosis in localized CRC [38], results in a lower proportion of patients (3%-4%) with metastatic dMMR/MSI-H CRC [39] who are available to benefit from such trials.
Unlike patients with dMMR/MSI-H mCRC, immunotherapy alone has not demonstrated a clinical benefit in pMMR/MSS mCRC and this subset constitutes most tumours. In the pivotal KEYNOTE-016 study with pembrolizumab, no responses were observed in these patients [8], consistently with the lack of efficacy of immunotherapy in early studies with non-selected patients, most of whom had pMMR/MSS mCRC. In the CheckMate-142 study, limited responses were seen in pMMR/ MSS tumours. The lack of CRC immunoreactivity and recruitment of immune cells seems to be the fundamental obstacle to efficacy. Combination treatment with PD-1 inhibitors and

modulators of other immune checkpoint molecules, such as CTLA-4, might be beneficial in a subset of patients with pMMR/ MSS tumours, as reported in a recent study [40]. Nevertheless, alternative approaches to modulate the tumour-immune microenvironment are currently being explored for the many CRC patients who harbour the pMMR-MSS subtype.
Biomarkers for response to immunotherapy beyond dMMR/MSI status
The presence of dMMR/MSI-H in solid tumours, including CRC, is now a clear potential biomarker for response to immunotherapy [7]. However, given the complexity of the antitumour immune response and the intra-tumoural and inter-metastasis heterogeneity, dMMR status alone is presumably not enough to accurately identify responders to ICIs [41]. Identification of more precise and reliable predictive biomarkers continues to be an unmet clinical need. A summary of promising biomarkers discussed hereafter is shown in Figure 1.
PD-1/PD-L1 expression
PD-1 is expressed by activated T-cells, B-cells, and natural killer (NK) cells and can bind to its ligand, PD-L1, as expressed on

tumour cells [42]. This expression is, in part, induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-c) that is produced by activated lymphocytes. PD-L1 expression, measured by immunohistochemical staining, has been extensively evaluated as a predictive biomarker of response to ICIs. Interestingly, in some tumour types, such as non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), gastric cancer, and oesophageal tumours, PD-L1 expression might be useful as a predictive marker of response to anti-PD-1 therapy [43-46]. However, several issues prevent PD-L1 expression from being a clinically useful biomarker. The use of various PD-L1-detection antibodies, the lack of standardization of PD-L1-expression evaluation, and the percentage of positive cells cut-off (ranging from >1% to >50% of tumour cells stained) limit its statistical significance. Moreover, PD-L1 expression can be induced by IFN-c or constitutive oncogene activation [47]. PD-L1 expression is a dynamic process that changes according to the tumour microenvironment and disease stage, and it could well be influenced by treatment [48]. PD-L1 expression in tumours is not uniform, and the sampling time and location may affect the results of PD-L1 staining [49]. Finally, patients who respond to ICIs, but do not express PD-L1, limit its clinical impact.
In CRC, PD-L1 expression was poorly correlated with dMMR/ MSI-H status [50] and not found to be associated with response

Schematic representation of colorectal-cancer-immune subgroups, linked biomarkers, and potential treatment strategies. `Immunocompetent' tumour (green circle) is characterized by a coordinated immune response with high T-cells (CD3, CD8, and Th1), macrophage infiltration, and upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules (CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1). `Immune evasion' group (blue circle) is characterized by poor immune cell infiltration. `Immunosuppressed' group (red circle) is characterized by high immune cell infiltration as well as a high infiltration of suppressor cells with suppressive cytokine release. The `immune evasion' and the `immunosuppressed' groups could be treated with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, cytokine modulation, or other approaches such as COX inhibition or A2AR inhibition, to render the tumours more immunogenic so that they benefit from ICIs. Possible biomarkers of response to ICIs are marked from 1 to 6. (1) PD-1/PD-L1 expression. (2) Tumour-mutation burden. (3) Mutation-associated neoantigens presentation on HLA class I.

or survival in the registration studies [35], thus limiting its impact in this particular type of solid tumour. A recent metaanalysis revealed that PD-L1 expression can serve as a significant biomarker for negative prognosis that is not related to clinicopathological characteristics [51].
Endogenous antitumour T-cell immunity is largely restricted to PD-1-high cytotoxic lymphocytes. Infiltration of NSCLC with such PD-1 high CD8 T-cells has recently been associated with clinical response to anti-PD-1 [52, 53]. Interestingly, Llosa and colleagues similarly reported that pMMR/MSS tumours infiltrated by PD-1-high CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes (without suppressor T helper 17 [Th17] cells) and expressing a high level of PD-L1 have an immune microenvironment resembling that of the dMMR/MSI-H and were associated with pembrolizumab benefit [54]. As previously reported in digestive cancers and melanoma [52], these PD-1-high CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes were characterized by an exhausted/memory transcriptome, suggesting the presence of an antitumour T-cell repertoire [54].
Neoantigens and mutational burden
Due to the hypermethylation of MLH1 [55, 56] or mutations in MMR genes [57], dMMR/MSI-H tumours harbour a high frequency of insertions/deletions (indels) in microsatellite sequences [58] and a high tumour mutational burden (TMB) [59] that result in a high mutation-associated neoantigen (MANA) load [29-31]. These neoantigens can be processed and presented by dendritic cells leading to the priming of a coordinated adaptive anticancer immune response [32], which explains the higher density of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and activated Th1 cells, as well as increased type I interferon production, observed in these tumours. This tumour-immune surveillance leads to the immunoediting concept. Three essential phases have been proposed: elimination, equilibrium, and escape [60]. During the elimination, innate and adaptive coordinate immune responses act together for the successful eradication of tumour cells. During the equilibrium phase, the continuous immune-selection pressure also induces a Darwinian selection process in which new tumour variants emerge, carrying various genetic and epigenetic changes in tumour behaviour such as the upregulation of checkpoint receptors including CTLA-4, PD1, PD-L1, indolamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), and LAG-3 [33], or the downregulation of antigen-presenting molecules. During the escape phase, various tumour-derived soluble factors contribute to the induction of a local immunosuppressive environment favouring immune escape, progression, and metastasis [61, 62].
In CRC, 12.8% of tumours simultaneously present TMB-high, dMMR-MSI-H, and PD-L1 expression [50]. A high percentage of concordance (44.2%) of TMB-high and dMMR-MSI-H was observed [50] and was predictive of response to ICIs [40, 63]. However, PD-L1 expression demonstrates great variability and can be expressed even in dMMR-MSI-H-negative and/or TMBlow cases. Interestingly, it is possible to have a TMB-high in the absence of dMMR-MSI-H, whereas dMMR-MSI-H with TMB-low is rare [50]. There is the need to standardize PD-1/PD-L1 expression and define cut-offs for TMB interpretation. The development of a liquid-biopsy method to identify tumours with dMMR-MSI-H or TMB-high is a non-invasive technique demonstrating its efficacy for the determination of response to ICIs [64].
Additionally, tumours harbouring mutations in the region encoding for the POLE exonuclease domain also presented high TMB and MANA load [65, 66]. POLE mutations are present

in 1%-2% of all CRC tumours. Similarly to dMMR/MSI-H CRC, patients with POLE-mutated CRC have a good prognosis, resulting in a lower proportion of mCRC than in stage I-III CRC [67]. They also present a higher level of CD8 lymphocyte infiltration, expression of cytotoxic T-cell markers, and effector cytokines [68]. Given the similarly enhanced immunogenicity of POLE-mutated CRCs to dMMR/MSI-H CRCs, the therapeutic potential of immune checkpoint blockade in the subset of POLEmutated CRCs is of particular interest [69]. Further investigation is currently underway in clinical trials. Therefore, a high TMB and MANA load, associated with a high T-lymphocyte infiltration, and T-cell diversity [70-72] have emerged as biomarkers of response to ICIs in several tumour types [73, 74].
Immune infiltration (immunoscore)
Interestingly, a high TMB might not always be necessary to drive an immune response. Evaluation of the presence of tumour-infiltrating CD3 and CD8 lymphocytes, through assignment of an immunoscore based on the density and the location of subsets of T-cells, was prognostic of clinical outcome in patients with stage I-III CRC and performed better than MSI and MMR status [75-77]. The immunoscore is a simple scoring system based on the numeration of two lymphocyte populations (CD3/CD45RO, CD3/CD8, or CD8/CD45RO), both in the core of the tumour and in the invasive margin of tumours. The immunoscore provides a score ranging from Immunoscore 0 (I0) when low densities of both cell types are found in both regions to Immunoscore 4 (I4) when high densities are found in both regions [78].
Recently, the prognostic impact of the immunoscore was validated in a study with samples from 2,681 stage I-III colon cancer patients from 14 centres in 13 countries [77]. Interestingly, the authors showed that patients with a high immunoscore had similar tumour relapse and survival, and that this was independent of their dMMR/MSI-H status. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that the favourable prognosis observed in dMMR/MSI-H-localized CRC is essentially related to high immune infiltration. Furthermore, the prognostic value of the immunoscore was validated in a meta-analysis of eight studies published between 2011 and 2018 [79], supporting the idea that TILs play an important role in disease control across all disease stages by preventing the dissemination of metastasis to lymph nodes and organs.
In mCRC characterized by multiple tumour lesions among different organs, the picture is more complex. We previously reported a comprehensive analysis of patients having undergone complete resection of all metastases and revealed the heterogeneity of the metastatic disease and its clinical impact [80-83]. Complex tumour-immune interrelations shape the metastatic landscape, not only in terms of lesion size, number, or mutational pattern, but also in terms of immune-cell infiltration. We observed a heterogeneous immune infiltrate, immunoscore, and mutational diversity within the multiple resected synchronous and metachronous metastases of patients. Adaptive immune cells and immunoscore quantified in the least-infiltrated metastasis per patient were the most associated with patient long-term survival. Within any specific patient, a high immune infiltrate/high immunoscore correlated with fewer metastases and improved long-term survival [80, 81]. In patients with unresectable mCRC, where adequate immunoscore assessment is impossible, we reported that a single biopsy of a metastasis was able to accurately identify low-infiltrated metastases, but that the overall intra-metastatic

The future of immunotherapy for pMMR/MSS CRC | 15

immune infiltrate might be better estimated with multiple biopsies or the sampling of larger tumour areas [81]. Importantly, on biopsies, the performance of the immunoscore was superior to that of PD-L1 in estimating the reality of concordance across the whole metastatic slide [80, 81]. This illustrated the fact that PDL1 stainings were more heterogeneous in a given metastasis.
High immunoscores reported in pMMR/MSS CRCs raise the question of whether immunophenotyping might predict which patients will benefit from immunotherapy. Just recently, some authors reported that higher CD3 and CD8 T-cell densities (but not PD-L1 expression on cancer cells) were associated with a higher ORR and duration of disease control in a small subgroup of patients with dMMR/MSI-H mCRC treated with pembrolizumab [84]. This suggests that a lower immunoscore is associated with immunotherapy resistance in dMMR/MSI-H tumours, which is consistent with the reported finding that lower immunoscores are associated with worse survival in patients with dMMR/MSI-H stage III colon cancers receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy [85]. Hence, combining the immunogenic features of the tumour microenvironment with TMB may be more precise in predicting immunotherapy response than either feature alone. Further validation of immunophenotyping as a predictive biomarker of immunotherapy response, specifically in metastatic disease, is needed for broad clinical utility and is currently being explored in our trials (NCT03608046 and NCT03127007).
Gene-expression signature
A comprehensive re-evaluation and comparison of CRC molecular gene-expression profiles has enabled the CRC Subtyping Consortium (CRCSC) to identify four robust consensus molecular subtype (CMS) classifications. The first type, CMS1-- immune, is mainly composed of dMMR/MSI-H tumours and is characterized by a high TMB, high immune infiltration and activation, and BRAF mutations. The second type, CMS2--canonical, is characterized by WNT and MYC activation. The third, CMS3--metabolic, is characterized by cancer-cell metabolic deregulation and KRAS mutation. The fourth type, CMS4--mesenchymal, is characterized by stromal infiltration, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b) activation, and angiogenesis [65]. Interestingly, the immune microenvironment of each CMS type is different. Stage-independent prognostic values and significant associations with clinical, biological, and treatment features have been demonstrated and recently validated in phase III clinical studies [86-88].
CMS1 and CMS4 are both `hot' tumours; they are considered to be immune-reactive and highly infiltrated by immune cells as opposed to CMS2 and CMS3, which are `cold' tumours. Despite CMS1 and CMS4 being immune-reactive, they each present distinct immune features and escape mechanisms. CMS1 present CD8 T-cells and CD68 macrophage infiltration as well as frequent upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules (CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1) responsible for the main immune escape mechanism in these tumours [89]. CMS4 present a different pattern of immune infiltration, which is mainly suppressive throughout the infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), T-regulatory cells (Tregs), monocyte-derived cells, and Th17 cells. In these tumours, immunosuppressive factors such as TGF-b and CXCL12 are upregulated along with chemokines, such as interleukin 23 (IL-23) and interleukin 17 (IL-17) [90]. CMS1 and CMS4 tumours are therefore likely to respond well to immune therapies, but they should each be treated distinctly. Patients harbouring CMS1 tumours could theoretically benefit

from ICIs alone, whereas those with the CMS4 subtype would be best suited to strategies combining TGF-b inhibitors, Tregs, MDSCs inhibition, and ICIs. The CMS classification is a promising new biomarker of response to immune therapies; however, as is the case with other biomarkers, care should be taken when selecting biopsies and resection specimens for CMS classification. It should be borne in mind that CMS classification was mainly derived from samples of primary non-metastatic CRC (92% of the samples); it was not totally reproducible on metastatic samples (e.g. liver metastases) [91] or validated in the metastatic setting [86]. Additionally, spatial- and temporal-tumour heterogeneity, predominant in the metastatic setting, can misevaluate CMS status. Thus, the source of the sample and prior treatments before collection must be carefully considered.
A recent study described an innate immune response in some CRC as being due to the upregulation of PD-L1 and IDO1 linked to DNA damage. In order to identify this subtype of tumours with defective DNA-damage response (DDR), the authors developed a 44-gene signature assay and reported that 80% of dMMR/MSI-H and 25% of pMMR/MSS tumours presented the signature. The DDR assay could therefore enable the identification of not only dMMR/MSI-H tumours, but also rare cases of pMMR/MSS tumours likely to respond to ICIs [92].
Microbiota
The gut microbiome also influences the outcome of cancer therapy by modulating the host inflammatory response [93, 94]. An intact microbiome is required for successful tumour control in response to genotoxic (e.g. oxaliplatin used in CRC) and immunomodulatory therapies (e.g. cyclophosphamide). Recent studies have reported the important role of the gut microbiome with ICI treatment [95-97]. It was found that primary resistance to ICIs (in melanoma and lung cancers) could be attributed to an abnormal gut microbiome due to the use of antibiotics. One study raises the hypothesis that transplanting faecal material from responding patients to non-responders could lead to improved tumour control. In this study, it was shown that, when germ-free mice were transplanted with faecal material from melanoma patients, they experienced improved tumour control, augmented T-cell responses, and greater efficacy of antiPD-LI therapy [98]. Metagenomics of patient stool samples at diagnosis have also revealed correlations between clinical responses to ICIs and the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila [95]. This influence of the microbiome in the outcome of cancer treatment and the function of anticancer immunity poses new questions from a preclinical and clinical standpoint in the CRC field. Despite some evidence of an association between the gut microbiome and CRC, its role in the treatment of advanced and metastatic CRC remains largely unexplored.
Immunotherapy for pMMR/MSS CRC: strategies and development
The recent success of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 treatments in dMMR/MSI-H patients and preclinical data showing that dMMR/ MSI-H tumours are not the only subgroup of CRC that could, theoretically, benefit from ICIs have led to the design of new clinical studies. These trials aim to select the subset of CRC patients most likely to respond to ICIs or to design novel therapeutic strategies to render these tumours `immune-competent' (Figure 1). Some oncological treatments may also be able to cause immunogenic cell death (ICD)--a form of cell apoptosis

16 | N. Huyghe et al.

that can induce an antitumour immune response and potentially overcome the primary resistance of pMMR/MSS CRC to ICIs. The main treatment strategies currently being investigated in clinical trials are summarized in this section and in Table 1.
Radiation therapy
Preclinical and early clinical studies have suggested that radiation therapy (RT) or chemo-radiation therapy (CRT) may be a clever way to expose neoantigens. By damaging DNA, radiotherapy induces tumour-cell death. This releases neoantigens creating immune-mediated antitumour responses [99] and ICD [100, 101]. In some patients, this `neoantigens release' can act as an in situ radiation-induced vaccine [102, 103]. This immune effect is applicable not only to the irradiated tumour site, but also to distant sites through the `abscopal effect' [104], which theoretically could be enhanced with ICIs. It has been shown, for example, that anti-CTLA-4 and/or anti-PD-L1 in combination with RT can work synergistically to significantly improve treatment response (including metastatic lesions outside the radiation field) and patient outcomes in metastatic melanoma and NSCLC [104, 105].
The data to understand the role of RT and ICIs in CRC are, however, limited. In mCRC, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) directed to a site of liver metastasis in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor did not illicit any response [106]. In another trial in mCRC evaluating pembrolizumab with palliative RT or with local ablation, one major response (1/11 patients, ORR  9%) in a metastatic site distant from the irradiated field was observed in the RT cohort [107]. Recently, dual blockade of CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) and PD-1 (nivolumab) with RT (8 Gy in three fractions to a single metastatic lesion) demonstrated feasibility and promising activity in a phase II study that included 40 patients with chemorefractory mCRC [108]. Among the 27 patients treated with protocol-defined RT (33% of patients never received RT due to progression or grade 3-4 TRAE), the ORR and disease-control rate (DCR) were 15% and 37%, respectively. The durability of disease control was impressive, with a median of >15 months. Modification of the dosing schedule to reduce the dropout rate should be considered for future development. The outcome of correlative studies (biopsies, whole-exome sequencing) are eagerly awaited.
Several clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of conventional or stereotactic RT in combination with ICIs are ongoing (Table 1). Our research group is currently conducting a multicentre randomized phase II trial (R-Immune trial, NCT03127007) evaluating the benefit of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) with preoperative CRT (45-50 Gy over 5 weeks in combination with 5-fluorouracil) for locally advanced rectal cancer. The trial design delays atezolizumab administration until 2 weeks after CRT initiation in order to explore the role of CRT alone on the tumour-immune microenvironment. The trial also incorporates multiple tumour, blood, and stool collections to investigate the role of several biomarkers (as previously described) in multiple correlative sub-studies.
Chemotherapy and targeted therapies
The first two lines of treatment in mCRC currently involve a combination of targeted therapies that inhibit the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; cetuximab and panitumumab), or angiogenesis (bevacizumab, aflibercept, or ramucirumab), together with chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) [109-113]. Recent evidence suggests that these

chemotherapy regimens can induce ICD by releasing damageassociated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [114, 115] and activating necrotic or apoptotic pathways [116]. The translocation of calreticulin is then recognized as a signal by dendritic cells (DCs) to mediate the phagocytosis of dying tumour cells. Agents such as 5-fluorouracil can induce the apoptosis of MDSCs, therefore inhibiting their immunosuppressive function and increasing CD8 T-cell function [117]. The analysis of the immune microenvironment of resected CRC liver metastases revealed that patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy had a significantly higher density of cytotoxic and memory T-cells compared with metastases of untreated patients [80, 81, 118]. Moreover, CRC liver metastases, which had achieved pathological and radiological responses, were associated with a significantly higher immunoscore, reflecting an increased adaptive immune response [81].
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a signal protein that stimulates the formation of blood vessels. It is often upregulated in cancer and contributes to tumour angiogenesis [119]. It also plays a role in the immune microenvironment by upregulating immune checkpoint molecules (PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, LAG-3) and downregulating antigen-presentation molecules. Additionally, VEGF inhibits DC maturation and increases the function of suppressor cells [120-128]. Studies combining antiangiogenic agents with ICIs, with or without chemotherapy (FOLFOX), initially suggested potentially synergistic activity [129, 130]; however, the randomized phase III MODUL trial failed to confirm the preliminary findings. In this trial, maintenance treatment with combined atezolizumab/bevacizumab/fluoropyrimidine after first-line induction with FOLFOX/bevacizumab did not demonstrate any clinical benefit in progression-free survival (PFS) or OS compared to bevacizumab and fluoropyrimidine alone.
Preclinical data have shown that cetuximab (a chimeric immunoglobulin G1 [IgG1] monoclonal antibody directed to the EGFR) combined with FOLFIRI (a combination chemotherapy regimen that does not induce ICD) induces ICD in a mouse model and CRC cell lines [131] and may favour the activation of T-cell-mediated immune response [128]. Cetuximab can also stimulate NK-mediated cell-antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [132]. We previously reported that patients treated preoperatively with chemotherapy and cetuximab had a higher infiltration of global (CD3), cytotoxic (CD8), and memory (CD45RO) T-cells into the core of their resected CRC liver metastases and higher immune-related gene expression compared to other treatments [80, 81]. This modification of the tumourimmune microenvironment has also been reported by another group [133] and observed in the small subgroup of patients with RAS-mutated mCRC [80]. This suggests that the immunological effect of cetuximab, unlike its cytotoxic activity, is independent of RAS-mutation status [80]. This promising treatment approach is currently being evaluated in a phase II trial combining avelumab (anti-PD-L1) with FOLFOX and cetuximab in first-line RAS and BRAF wild-type (wt) mCRC (AVETUX trial). The preliminary results from 20 patients have been reported demonstrating an ORR of 75% and a DCR of 95% [134]. Another multicentre phase II trial is currently investigating the question of cetuximab in combination with avelumab as a rechallenge in mCRC patients who have already experienced a partial or complete response with an anti-EGFR plus chemotherapy in first-line treatment (CAVE Colon study). In the same way, our group is currently investigating the efficacy of avelumab combined with cetuximab and irinotecan (AVETUXIRI trial, NCT03608046) in mCRC patients refractory to chemotherapy (cohort A: RAS-mutated)

and anti-EGFR treatment (cohort B: RAS wt). We hope to confirm that the immunological effect of cetuximab can provoke a tumour response when combined with avelumab irrespective of RAS mutation. We also plan to prospectively investigate the previously described efficacy biomarkers. For this reason, multiple tumour biopsies and blood collection are planned in the correlative sub-study.
Preclinical studies have reported that MEK inhibitors may be associated with a tumour immunological effect [135, 136]. MEK inhibition upregulates MHC class I expression [137], which promotes antigen presentation on the surface of tumour cells for recognition by CD8 T-lymphocytes, which then recognize and kill tumour cells. In mouse models, the combination of PD-1 and MEK inhibitors has synergistic tumour-growth inhibition compared to single-agent treatment [135, 136]. This efficacy was clinically observed in a phase Ib study combining atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) and cobimetinib (anti-MEK) in 23 chemorefractory mCRC patients with an ORR of 17% (4 of 23 patients) [129]. The IMblaze370 (Cotezo) randomized phase III trial failed, however, to confirm this efficacy. Chemorefractory mCRC patients

randomized in the combined experimental arm (cobimetinib/ atezolizumab) did not experience any increased tumour response or survival benefit (PFS, OS) compared to patients treated with atezolizumab alone or regorafenib [138].
The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is implicated in cell survival, migration, and proliferation, and is often dysregulated in cancer [139]. Interestingly, recent observation suggests that inhibition of this pathway could have not only an effect on tumour cells, but also an effect on the immune microenvironment by preventing the activation of the immunosuppressive pathway [140]. The strategy of combining a PI3K inhibitor and an ICI may lead to an increased ICI response in tumours with an immunosuppressive environment, such as pMMR/MSS CRC. Ongoing trials evaluating chemo and targeted therapies are summarized in Table 1.
Cytokines
Cytokines and chemokines are immune-system molecular messengers. Therefore, targeting these molecules in

combination with ICIs is another approach currently under investigation [141].
Interleukin 15 (IL-15) is a glucoprotein that belongs to the 4-alpha-helix bundle family of cytokines. In the immune system, IL-15 is mainly expressed by monocytes, macrophages, and DCs, and has been characterized as a T-cell growth factor [142]. Upon binding to its receptor, highly expressed on CD8 and NK cells, IL-15 promotes the proliferation and function of these cells. The efficacy of IL-15 administration is limited by its short half-life in vivo [143], but a chimeric fusion protein (ALT-803) that increases the in vivo half-life has been developed. This treatment is currently being tested in combination with different ICIs in patients with advanced cancer, including mCRC patients (NCT03228667).
CXCL12, a chemokine mainly expressed by cancerassociated fibroblasts, has been reported to mediate immune exclusion in mouse models [144]. Therefore, the idea of blocking CXCL12 and the binding to its receptors, CXCR4 and CXCR7, is an interesting novel approach to increase the efficacy of ICIs in immune-excluded tumours with a low immunoscore. This approach is being investigated in a study combining olaptesed (NOX-A12)--a heptamer that binds CXCL12 with high affinity-- with pembrolizumab (NCT03168139).
Another way to potentially increase efficacy is to stimulate cytokine release. A phase I/II trial is evaluating how the combination of pembrolizumab and poly-ICLC--a molecule that stimulates cytokine release by inducing IFN-c production-- generates an inflammatory response (NCT02834052).
Even if its function in cancer is controversial [145], human cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is known to regulate cell differentiation [146] and local recruitment of dendritic cells [147]. This may enhance tumourassociated antigen presentation to T-cells [148] and activate other effectors of the immune response, including macrophages and NK cells [147, 149]. A trial is evaluating a virus, talimogene laherparepvec, that encodes the immunostimulating factor GMCSF. This virus infects and replicates in tumour cells, leading to cell lysis and GM-CSF release. Combining the talimogene laherparepvec virus with atezolizumab is therefore a promising approach to increase the antitumour immune response in mCRC (NCT03256344).
Others
Other trials underway aim to combine ICIs with molecules that target metabolic pathways. Two trials are currently testing nivolumab with or without ipilimumab combined with celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor (NCT03926338 and NCT03026140). The expression of COX-2 may induce expression of IDO1 [150]. IDO1 is an intracellular enzyme that catalyses tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway [151] and induces depletion of tryptophan, leading to an immunosuppressive environment [152, 153]. Higher IDO1 expression in CRC tumours correlates with progressive disease and impaired clinical outcome [154]. For this reason, inhibitors of IDO1, such as epacadostat, are currently being tested in combination with ICIs (NCT02327078 and NCT02959437).
One trial is assessing the combination of metformin with nivolumab (NCT03800602) based on its preliminary reported efficacy in metastatic melanoma [155].
The activation of the A2a and A2b adenosine receptors on immune cells inhibits their proliferation and activation resulting in strong immunosuppression and T-cell anergy [156, 157].

Adenosine has been found to be one of the mechanisms used by Tregs to maintain immunotolerance [158]. Inhibition of the adenosine A2a receptor may potentiate ICIs, such as durvalumab (anti-PD-L1), and could prove to be a worthwhile treatment approach. This strategy is currently being evaluated in a safety trial in patients with advanced solid malignancies, including CRC (NCT02740985).
Cibisatamab (CEA CD3 TCB; RG7802, RO6958688) is a T-cell bispecific antibody (TCB) that simultaneously binds to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) on tumour cells and CD3 on T-cells, thus cross-linking cancer cells and T-cells. This leads to T-cell engagement and activation independently of pre-existing immunity, T-cell infiltration, and tumour inflammation. In ongoing studies, encouraging clinical activity has been reported in patients with metastatic pMMR/MSS CRC treated with CEA-TCB monotherapy, and its activity was enhanced when combined with atezolizumab [159]. In the combination therapy group, the ORR was 18% (n  2) and the observed DCR was 82%. Toxic effects were manageable. CEA-TCB is the first T-cell bispecific antibody to show efficacy in solid tumours and specifically in pMMR-MSS CRC.
Finally, adoptive cell-based immunotherapy with genetically modified T-cells represents a promising emerging modality for CRC treatment. Adoptive cell therapy is based on collection of T-cells from patients, in vitro expansion, and transfusion of T-cells into patients. These T-cells can be engineered to express chimeric antigens receptors (CARs) or selected for their ability to bind tumour antigens. Moreover, CAR T-cells can be engineered to not only recognize tumour antigens, but also to produce cytokines or ICIs. However, despite the fact that CAR T-cells are successfully used for treating haematological cancers such as B-cell malignancies, the efficacy and applicability of cell-based immunotherapy remain to be proved in CRC and other solid tumours [7, 160]. Nevertheless, EGFR-CAR-T or Mucin-1 (MUC1)-CAR T-cells expressing anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 are currently clinically tested on solid tumours expressing these antigens (EGFR and MUC1).
Conclusion
It is undeniable that considerable advances have been made with the recent FDA approval of ICIs for the treatment of dMMR/ MSI-H mCRC. Unfortunately, dMMR/MSI-H CRC represent only a small subgroup of all CRC and most pMMR/MSS mCRC does not benefit from ICIs alone.
Beyond the dMMR/MSI-H tumour status, the continuous development of new biomarkers, such as immunoscore and CMS classification, has led to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that define the immune reactivity of CRC and their relationship with oncological treatments. This provides new perspectives, enables a more personalized approach towards patient management, and should continue to be investigated in the translational aspect of clinical trials. That said, many of these biomarkers are governed by a heterogeneous expression pattern in time and space. Therefore, the source of the tumour sample, and any treatments administered prior to sample collection, must be carefully considered.
The key remaining challenge is to identify, among the heterogeneous spectrum of mCRC, which patients are most likely to benefit from ICIs alone or in combination with other oncological treatments, because of their specific genomic and immune tumour characteristics. This question is currently under investigation in ongoing clinical trials.

Background:
Current risk stratification systems in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), e.g. by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017, help to inform treatment decisions, including those for an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in first remission. Recently Gerstung et al. (Nature Genetics, 2017) developed a knowledge bank (KB)-based algorithm to in order to more precisely predict individual outcomes based on demographic, clinical, and genetic data. Two studies validated the feasibility of the KB prediction in AML patients (pts) consolidated with chemotherapy. However, a validation in a HSCT-treated cohort - crucial with respect to informed decisions towards HSCT - is lacking.
Aims:
To validate the feasibility of KB outcome prediction in a HSCT-treated cohort.
Methods: We analyzed 545 AML pts (median age at diagnosis 62, range 21-77 years) consolidated by reducedintensity (23%) or non-myeloablative (77%) allogeneic HSCT. 60% of pts were in first remission. All clinical variables included in the KB were available for this cohort, while our gene mutation panel did not cover 17/58 of genes included in the KB. KB predictions 3 years after diagnosis were retrospectively calculated by using the adapted transplant strategy and compared to the observed outcomes using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Additionally, the measurable residual disease (MRD) status at HSCT - based on NPM1 mutation and BAALC, MN1, and WT1expression - was evaluated by digital droplet PCR in pts with material available.
Results:
The area under the curve (AUC) to predict 3-year overall survival (OS) produced by the KB value was 0.69 (95% CI 0.62-0.72), not significantly different compared to the AUC based on ELN2017 risk groups (0.66 [95% CI 0.570.71], P= 0.23, Figure 1A), and worse compared to the published results in chemotherapy consolidated pts (AUCKB = 0.80, Bill et al, J Hematol Oncol 2021). Still, in a multivariate analysis the KB prediction for 3-year OS significantly impacted OS (OR 6.25, CI 2.9-13.2) after adjustment for the MRD-corrected remission status at HSCT. Aikaike Information criterion comparison with a model including the ELN2017 risk groups and the MRD-corrected remission status at HSCT demonstrated the model containing the KB prediction as preferable. When introducing cut-offs according to the KB value for OS at 3 years similar to Fenwarth et al. (Blood 2021), we observed a clear separation of OS curves according to a KB value of <20, 20-39, and  40 with higher values indicating a higher likelihood for OS (P< 0.001, Figure 1B). Regarding additional endpoints, the KB algorithm had the highest probability to correctly predict death without previous achievement of a remission (AUCKB = 0.75, Figure 1C, black), restricted prediction for death in first remission (AUCKB = 0.61, Figure 1C, red) or after relapse (AUCKB = 0.63, Figure 1C, blue), but good prediction for being alive in first remission (AUCKB = 0.69, Figure 1D, red) or after relapse (AUCKB = 0.77, Figure 1D, blue).

Summary/Conclusion: For HSCT treated AML pts the KB-based outcome prediction was inferior compared to previous studies of pts receiving chemotherapy. The likely reason for this inferiority is the introduction of confounders (e.g donor selection or conditioning regimens), that may impact treatment-related mortality, and are not integrated in and not predictable by the current KB algorithm. Future versions of the KB that also consider HSCT-associated factors might further improve outcome prediction by this promising clinical tool.

Craniosynostosis is a congenital malformation of the infant skull typically treated via corrective surgery. To accurately quantify the extent of deformation and identify the optimal correction strategy, the patient-specific skull model extracted from a pre-surgical computed tomography (CT) image needs to be registered to an atlas of head CT images representative of normal subjects. Here, the authors present a robust multistage, multi-resolution registration pipeline to map a patient-specific CT image to the atlas space of normal CT images. The proposed registration pipeline first performs an initial optimisation at very low resolution to yield a good initial alignment that is subsequently refined at high resolution. They demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method by evaluating its performance on 560 head CT images of 320 normal subjects and 240 craniosynostosis patients and show a success rate of 92.8 and 94.2%, respectively. Their method achieved
a mean surface-to-surface distance between the patient and template skull of <2.5 mm in the targeted skull region across both the normal
subjects and patients.

1. Introduction: Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of sutures in the infant skull that restricts the normal growth of the skull and brain. It is a congenital malformation occurring in 1 of 2500 live births [1]. Early diagnosis and surgical treatment is essential to avoid the elevated intracranial pressure that leads to respiratory and visual impairments associated with the malformation [2, 3]. Craniosynostosis treatment involves cranial surgery to provide adequate intracranial volume facilitating brain growth and to create an aesthetically normal skull shape and facial appearance. While there is no single best method for treatment, therapy is driven by the philosophy of the institution and the wishes of the parents [4]. When cranial reconstruction surgery is the selected treatment plan, careful preoperative planning is required to minimise complications and morbidity.
Computed tomography (CT) imaging is the preferred modality for diagnosis, preoperative planning and post-surgical assessment of craniosynostosis patients [2]. A high-quality 3D skull model is reconstructed from the patient's CT image and used to analyse the precise skull deformation relative to a normal skull shape [5]. Subsequently, the closest normal skull is identified to serve as the target skull shape for corrective surgery. Hence, a surgical plan to cut and reconfigure the bones is prepared using computer-aided design software or 3D-printed models, such that the pathological skull matches the target skull shape. A critical step in this presurgical planning is the registration of the craniosynostotic skull into the normative image space.
Various image registration techniques have been proposed in [6], yet despite their exhaustive dissemination and citation, medical image registration is seldom used in clinical practice [7]. Of the disseminated registration methods, only a few study skull registration of craniosynostotic cases. The study in [8] was limited to generating an average normative pediatric skull model from 103 normal infant skulls aged 8-12 months using point-set-based registration algorithm [9], but did not include any pathological cases. Sahilliouglu et al. [10] used PCA alignment of point sets and performed a modified iterative closest point (ICP) global registration

followed by deformable volumetric registration, but evaluated their method on only five craniosynostotic patients. Therefore, a robust registration technique to map a pathological case into the normative image space would be very useful to precisely plan the corrective surgery.
Here we describe and validate a robust multi-stage, multiresolution image registration pipeline for craniosynostotic skull registration. We propose a clinically applicable method that leverages the lower skull features not affected by the disease pathology to map the patient skull into the image space of normal skulls, despite the large deformities induced by craniosynostosis. Moreover, we implement and assess the performance of the registration on a large number of both normal (320) and pathological (240) cases.
The proposed registration pipeline, which is the focus of this paper, serves as the first step in planning the skull correction surgery. Following patient skull mapping into the normative skull space, a normal skull closest in shape to the craniosynostosis skull is identified and used as a post-surgical target. The surgery is then planned according to the estimated deformation required to correct the diseased skull shape to its desired normal shape. Fig. 1 shows how this proposed image registration pipeline fits within the larger scope of the project aimed at optimising presurgical planning for craniosynostotic corrective surgery.
2. Methods: Our workflow entails several stages: first we extract the head and segment the skull using fixed and adaptive thresholds, respectively. We then employ a robust five-stage multi-resolution registration pipeline to register the segmented binary skull with the template skull. Since CT image intensities are a direct measure of tissue density and standardised via the Hounsfield unit (HU) [12], a good skull segmentation is achieved by simple adaptive thresholding. We then employ a segmentation-based registration to map the normal and craniosynostosis patient skulls into the template image space.

Fig. 1 Craniosynostosis skull correction pipeline. Normal skulls segmented from CT images are registered to the template skull to create a normal skull shape atlas. Craniosynostosis patient skull is registered to the atlas to quantify skull deformity, determine the best patient-specific target skull shape after surgery, and perform the cranial deformation analysis to plan the surgical correction of skull shape as in [11]
2.1. Head segmentation: Since the Hounsfield number of air is -1000 HU and that of fat ranges between -100 and -50 HU, we select a heuristic threshold of -200 HU to delineate the structures of interest (tissues, fat, and bones) from the CT image. We then use a binary morphological opening operation to separate noisy structures attached to the patient head, followed by largest connected component extraction to retain the head segmentation as shown in Fig. 2. It is worth noting that due to the binary morphological opening operation, the obtained segmentation features holes in the nose, air tract, and ear regions that serve as landmarks for the subsequent image registration.
2.2. Skull segmentation using adaptive thresholding: Since we cannot rely on a single threshold to delineate between bone and soft tissues, we threshold the image region within the head mask (Section 2.1) using several threshold values between 60 and 300 HU at an increment of 20 HU and select the optimum threshold that yields a minimum number of connected components. A low threshold would produce high number of connected components by segmenting soft tissues as bone, while a high threshold would split bones into pieces leading to a higher number of connected components. Since the largest connected component might not include all the major bones, due to open

sutures in infant skull, we retain the connected components comprising of at least 95% of the total number of segmented pixels to obtain the optimal skull segmentation as shown in Fig. 2.

2.3. Image registration: To register a patient head CT image into the normative space, we select an 8-month-old healthy patient with high CT resolution and adequate extent of imaged anatomy to serve as a template. We then segment the individual bones from the template CT image manually to generate a template skull model (Fig. 4c). Automatically segmented normal and craniosynostosis skulls are registered to the template skull space for further analysis.
The skull is a rigid object and to maintain its shape proportions, we parameterise the registration using a seven degree of freedom similarity transformation - translation along and rotation about the x-, y-, and z-axes and isotropic scaling. We define a similarity function f (.) based on the sum of squared difference between the images being registered:

f (x; p) = 1 (I (x) - I (t(x; p)))2

(1)

Nt F

M

VF,M

where x is a three-dimensional vector representing image space, IF and IM are Gaussian filtered fixed and moving images, respectively, t(.) is the similarity transform (with seven-parameters p) applied to

Hence, the image registration is formulated as a minimisation of the similarity function in a seven-dimensional parametric space p. We use the regularised gradient descent algorithm [13] implemented in the Insight Toolkit (ITK) to minimise the function f (.)
using the parameter update:

p = p + h f (pn)

where h is the learning rate set to 0.5, which reduces by a relaxation factor of half each time the gradient of the objective function changes abruptly, facilitating the convergence of the algorithm towards the closest optimum. The algorithm converges when the step size gets very small or the parameter difference Dp or the difference in the cost function Df between consecutive iterations is either very small or maximum number of iterations have been reached.
The similarity function f (.) is highly non-linear in the sevendimensional parametric space and hence the probability of converging to a local minimum during the optimisation is very high. To avoid convergence to local minima, we employ a five-stage registration pipeline (Fig. 3) where the first three optimisations are performed at low resolution with high Gaussian blurring to obtain a coarse alignment, whereas the final two stages refine the registration results at higher resolution. The optimal transformation obtained from each stage is used as an initialisation for the subsequent stage.

2.3.1. Binary head mask registration: We recover the initial translation between the two CT images by aligning the centroids of the head masks (Section 2.1). Next, to recover the scaling between the patient and the template head, we modify the similarity metric (1) such that:
IF (x) = MHT(4x), IM (x) = MHS(4x), N = N1 and VtF,M = VtT1,S
where MHT and MHS are Gaussian filtered binary head segmentations for template and subject CT images, respectively, and N1 is the number of voxels in the image overlap domain VtT1,S. The

Fig. 3 Proposed registration pipeline for aligning normal and craniosynostosis skulls to the template skull. We start by aligning the head centroids followed by three stages of optimisation performed at low-resolution to obtain a coarse initial alignment; this alignment is then refined at higher resolution in final two stages. Finally, we use the lower region to refine the registration in the final stage to obtain good alignment for highly deformed craniosynostosis skulls
optimisation is performed at one-fourth of the original resolution using the parameter update (2).
2.3.2. Signed distance-based head registration: The anatomical extent and orientation of a patient's head varies significantly between the images being registered. Hence, we use the holes in nose, air tract, and ear regions as landmarks to recover the accurate orientation from the head segmentations. As such, the similarity metric (1) is modified using:
IF (x) = DT(MHT(4x)), IM (x) = D(MHS(4x)), N = N2 and VtF,M = VtT2,HS
where D(.) is the signed distance function (SDF) with positive values outside and negative values inside the binary object, DT(.) is the truncated SDF with a fixed high value T = 1000 assigned to the positive distances, and N is the number of voxels in the image overlap domain VtT2,HS within the moving image mask MHS. Assigning high values to the distances outside MHT restricts the MHS to be transformed within the MHT, forcing the orientation recovery via the landmarks in the head segmentations. The optimisation is performed at one-fourth of the original resolution.
2.3.3. Signed distance-based skull registration: To recover the appropriate scaling factor between the two skull segmentations following the rotation correction, we modify the similarity metric (1) using:
IF (x) = D(MST(4x)), IM (x) = D(MSS(4x)), N = N3 and VtF,M = VtT3,S
where MST and MSS are the binary skull segmentations (Section 2.2) for template and subject CT images, respectively, D(.) is the SDF operator, and N is the number of voxels in the image overlap domain VtT3,S. The optimisation is also performed at one-fourth of the original resolution.
2.3.4. Binary skull registration: The first three low-resolution optimisation steps yield a good coarse skull alignment, which we

then refine by modifying the cost function (1) using:
IF (x) = MST(2x), IM (x) = MSS(2x), N = N4 and VtF,M = VtH4T,HS
where N4 is the number of voxels in the image overlap domain VtH4T,HS, within the fixed and moving image masks MHT and MHS, respectively. The optimisation is performed at half the original resolution.
2.3.5. Binary skull registration in low region of interest (ROI): Since our registration algorithm is targeted for craniosynostosis application, it must retain robust and accurate alignment despite severely deformed skull shapes. Hence, we use the lower region of the skull located below four anatomical landmarks - the Opisthion, Nasion, and Left and Right Dorsum Sellae [5] - to register the skulls, since this region is not affected by the disease pathology and features low shape variability across normal and craniosynostosis patients. The final registration stage refines the skull alignment within the low ROI (Fig. 4c) using:
IF (x) = MST(x), IM (x) = MSS(x), N = N5 and VtF,M = VtL5ROI,HS
in (1), where t5(.) is the final similarity transform between the subject and template CT images, and N5 is the number of voxels in the image overlap domain VtL5ROI,HS, within the fixed and moving image masks MLROI and MHS, respectively. The final alignment is performed at full image resolution.
3. Results: The proposed algorithm was implemented in C++ using the ITK library on a 2.4 GHz Xenon machine with 72 GB of RAM and took 450 s on average to segment a subject CT image and register it to the template skull model.
We tested our registration pipeline on 560 CT images with an age range of 1 week to 19 years (3.0 + 24.24 months) and in-plane and slice resolution of 0.26-0.49 mm and 0.625-5 mm, respectively.
We quantitatively evaluate our registration accuracy by computing the mean absolute distance and 95th percentile symmetric distance between the template skull model and the registered subject model. Fig. 4 shows the absolute distances between the registered subject and template model mapped onto the subject model for both normal and craniosynostosis cases.

Highest error occurs in the fontanel region due to the anatomical mismatch between the subject and template models, hence we rely on 95th percentile distance instead of the maximum distance.

The distance metric for full skull, upper ROI and lower ROI regions are plotted from left to right. Normal (297) and craniosynostosis (226) cases are shown in light and dark colours, respectively. The mean and 95th percentile distances in the lower ROI are within 2.5 and 5.0 mm, respectively
ROI are 1.29 + 0.32 and 1.79 + 0.53 mm, whereas that for the upper ROI are 3.34 + 1.31 and 4.95 + 1.96 mm, respectively. High registration accuracy in the lower ROI region for both normal and craniosynostotic cases demonstrates the robustness of our method. As expected, registration error in upper ROI for craniosynostosis patients is high due to the deformity of the pathological skull.
A small surface-to-surface distance is a necessary condition for good registration but not sufficient. Hence, we also perform qualitative evaluation by visual inspection of the registration results. The algorithm produced visually correct results for 297 normal (out of 320) and 226 craniosynostosis (out of 240) cases as shown in Table 1.
A general registration approach is to align the centroids of skull segmentations and perform optimisations as described in fourth and fifth stages of Section 2.3 as employed in [5]. Here we compare the additional registration robustness introduced by the first three stages of our pipeline that perform initial alignment in low resolution, against the baseline scheme [5] in Table 1. We are able to reduce the number of registration failures from 47 to 23 for normal cases

and from 30 to 14 for craniosynostosis cases, therefore leading to a 47% improvement in registration robustness on average.

4. Discussion: As evident from Fig. 1, this paper addresses the most important and difficult part of the problem of robustly registering a diseased patient skull to the `normative' space of normal skulls. Although registration algorithms exist that register the image of a normal skull to another reasonably well, there are unfortunately no sufficiently robust registration methods that are specifically tailored to registering deformed skulls to normal skulls.
In the second part of the project, which is currently underway, following the accurate recovery of pose and scaling using linear registration, we perform the shape analysis using non-rigid registration algorithms to quantify the amount and nature of deformity associated with the diseased skull and hence to determine the closest normal skull shape to serve as target during corrective surgery.
Briefly, our proposed strategy is to use non-rigid registration to compute the closest normal target skull shape based on the deformation of the diseased patient's skull with respect to the unbiased, average skull shape obtained by co-registering normal skulls, therefore removing the bias towards a single subject.
The goal of this first stage is to remove the pose and scale variation in the normal and diseased patients and bring them all into the same coordinate space. Existing alternative solutions for linear registrations can be broadly classified as point-set-based algorithms and image-based algorithms. The ICP algorithm is a popular point-set-based algorithm where the point sets are initially aligned using the principal component directions. Due to the deformations induced by the premature fusion of the sutures, the structure of the skull changes significantly, rendering the principal componentsbased initial alignment highly susceptible to error, and, as a result, the final registration result is highly inaccurate and unrealistic. Although the image-based linear registration algorithms are computationally demanding, they have more flexibility in implementation. Here we alternate between the binary image and distance maps to carefully guide the registration towards the appropriate solution and compare our results against a standard image-based registration algorithm. Moreover, by selecting and optimising the registration parameters, we demonstrate that our method performs well on registering both the normal subjects and diseased patients.
Specifically, we demonstrated the robustness of our algorithm by evaluating its performance on 360 image datasets of normal subjects and 240 image datasets of diseased patients. The age of the normal subjects and diseased patients is summarised in Table 2:

normal subjects were 10.6 + 7.2 months (1 week to 24 months), and the diseased patients were 17.6 + 31.9 months (1 week to 228 months). While the early diagnosis and treatment of the patients occurs within the first 2 years of age and considering that there is minimal skull growth beyond 6 years of age, the normal subjects used to create an atlas are in the representative age range of 1 week to 24 months. Nevertheless, eight patients above 84 months old who underwent craniosynostosis correction surgery at Children's National Medical Center were included in our study to demonstrate that our registration method is robust across a wide variety of patient populations, clinical data, and disease characteristics (Table 3).
Moreover, the radiation exposure to the patients should be minimised, and hence the CT scans are acquired with a limited anatomical coverage, mostly including the regions affected by the malformation. Our approach focuses on registering the malformed patient to the normal template by excluding the regions significantly affected by the disease from the registration in the final stage. As evident from the registration accuracy in the lower stable parts of the skull, the algorithm performs reasonably well even for the malformed patients.
5. Conclusion: We presented a robust multi-stage, multi-resolution pipeline for registration of both normal and craniosynostosis skulls and conducted an exhaustive evaluation on 560 clinical CT images with success rates of 92.8 and 94.2% across 320 normal and 240 craniosynostosis patients, respectively. We evaluated our registration success using surface-to-surface distance accompanied by a visual inspection. Our method reduced the registration failure in both normal and craniosynostosis cases by 47% compared with a baseline registration algorithm employed in [5]. Finally, this registration yielded an accuracy within 2.5 and 5.0 mm for mean absolute and 95th percentile surface-to-surface distance across the lower skull ROI for both normal and

craniosynostosis cases, respectively. Hence, this registration pipeline can be reliably used to map craniosynostotic skulls into the normative skull space to help identify the closest normal skull shape that serves as post-procedural target during corrective surgery planning.

PURPOSE. We reported previously that aquaporin 0 (AQP0) modulates lens fiber cell gap junction (GJ) channel function. The present study was conducted to find out whether the Cterminal end of AQP0 is involved in this regulation.
METHODS. A mouse model, AQP0DC/DC, was genetically engineered to express AQP0 with 1246 amino acids, without the normal intact AQP0 (1-263 amino acids) in the lens. Transparency and focusing of the lens were assessed. Intracellular impedance was measured to determine GJ coupling resistance. Intracellular hydrostatic pressure (HP) was also determined. Western blotting was performed to determine connexin (Cx46 and Cx50) expression levels.
RESULTS. At postnatal day 10, AQP0DC/DC mouse lenses relative to age-matched wild-type lenses showed loss of transparency and abnormal optical distortion; GJ coupling resistance increased in the differentiating (1.6-fold) and mature (8-fold) fiber cells; lens HP increased approximately 1.5-fold at the junction between the differentiating and mature fiber cells and approximately 2.0-fold in the center; there was no significant change (P > 0.05) in expression levels of Cx46 or Cx50.
CONCLUSIONS. The increase in GJ coupling resistance was not associated with reduced connexin expression, suggesting either a reduction in the open probability or some physical change in plaque location. The increase in resistance was significantly greater than the increase in HP, suggesting less pressure-driven water flow through each open GJ channel. These changes may lead to a loss of transparency and abnormal optical distortion. Overall, our data demonstrate the C-terminal end of AQP0 is involved in modulating GJ coupling to maintain lens transparency and homeostasis.

cells give rise to secondary fiber cells that elongate to form the

During the differentiation of the fiber cells, aquaporin 0

amino acids, begins to express at the outer cortex. As the fiber

crystallins.25,26 AQP0 and the above-mentioned interacting proteins undergo a gradual loss of N- and C-terminal ends. The C-terminal end-cleavage starts at the inner cortex; the amount of end-cleaved forms increases toward the outer nucleus, and the inner nucleus contains only the end-cleaved forms.2,18,27,28 End-cleavage has been speculated to be part of the aging process; however, N- and C-terminal end-cleavage occurs even in the lenses of 2-year-old humans27 and postnatal day 10 (P10) mice pups.17 These types of cleavages are accelerated at old age in human lenses.2,28
Connexin (Cx) transmembrane proteins form gap junction (GJ) channels between the fiber cells, allowing small molecules such as ions (Na and Ca2), cellular metabolites, and second messengers to move between cells.29-38 Epithelial cells express Cx43 and Cx50, whereas fiber cells express Cx46 and Cx50.39 AQP water channels are present in epithelial and fiber cells.40-43 AQP1 and AQP5 are expressed in the epithelial cells, and AQP0 and AQP5 in the fiber cells. All play important roles in the lens microcirculation and homeostasis. Alterations or loss of AQP0, Cx46, or CX50 lead to loss of homeostasis and lens opacities.43-46 Several mutations in AQP0 or GJ proteins are responsible for congenital cataracts.44,45

tates ion and nutrient to enter and metabolic waste to exit the lens; AQPs, GJs and ion channels (transporters, cotransporters, and exchangers) are involved in creating and maintaining the microcirculation.38,46-48 The lens microcirculation model proposed by Mathias et al.38,46 suggests that sodium ions enter at the anterior and posterior poles and move through the extracellular space toward the center of the lens. Extracellular sodium moves toward the center of the lens because the sodium ions are continuously leaving the extracellular compartment as they enter fiber cells down their transmembrane electrochemical potential. In the intracellular compartment, a center-to-surface electrochemical gradient develops to drive sodium ions through GJs toward the equatorial surface where they are transported out by the epithelial Na-K-ATPases (for Na) or Na/Ca2 exchanger and Ca2-ATPase (for Ca2). Osmosis drives water flow to follow the sodium flow and enter fiber cells across their cell membranes. In the intracellular compartment, salt and water both flow through GJs, so osmosis is not possible; instead, a center-to-surface hydrostatic pressure (HP) gradient develops to drive water flow through GJs to the lens surface. At the lens surface, the fluid follows the sodium and leaves the lens due to transmembrane osmosis. In this microcirculation, the inward fluid flow carries nutrients and antioxidants to central fiber cells, while the outward fluid flow carries waste products from central fibers to surface epithelial cells. GJs are involved in the outflow of the lens microcirculatory system.39 Measurement of the intracellular HP gradient provides information on the number of open GJ channels conducting the radial flow of both sodium and water and also indicates the functional state of the sodium circulation.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies showed that endcleaved AQP0 in the mature fiber cells regulates the spatial localization of GJs.49,50 Modulation of GJs by AQP0 has been reported by in vitro investigations.13,51 We demonstrated that AQP0, in the presence of lens beaded filament proteins, modulates GJ channel function24 and suggested that fiber cell- to-fiber cell adhesion by AQP0 could be a significant factor in the regulation of GJ function. To understand the role of the Cterminal end of AQP0 in the lens physiology, we developed a mouse model, AQP0DC/DC, that expresses only end-cleaved AQP0 in the fiber cells.17 Lenses of these mice developed cataracts by P15, so we studied lenses at P10 to see what physiological changes preceded the formation of cataracts and thus might be causal. GJ coupling resistance and HP were measured in age-matched wild-type (WT) and AQP0DC/DC lenses.

Evaluation of Lens Transparency and Aberration
Lens transparency was assessed as described by Kumari et al.24 In short, P10 lenses of WT and AQP0DC/DC mice were dissected and placed into mammalian physiological saline (378C). Lens imaging of WT and AQP0DC/DC was done under the same lighting and imaging conditions, using a dark-field binocular microscope with a digital camera. Aberrations in the lens were qualitatively evaluated using dark-field optical grid focusing. Each lens was placed on a copper electron microscope specimen grid and imaged. Light scatter and aberrations were assessed by the quality of the grid lines focused by the lenses.

Lens GJ Coupling Measurement

Lenses were dissected from P10 WT and AQP0DC/DC pups and mounted as described by Gao et al.53 and Kumari et al.24 For

each impedance study, the lens was mounted in the perfusion

chamber that was attached to a microscope stage and perfused

with normal Tyrode's solution.

GJ coupling resistance (intracellular impedance) was

measured using microelectrodes filled with 3M KCl with initial resistances of 1.5 to 2 megaohms (MX).54 A microelectrode

was inserted into a central fiber cell, and a wide-band

stochastic current was injected. Another microelectrode was

inserted into a peripheral fiber cell at a distance r (cm) from

the center of a lens of radius a (cm) to record the induced

voltage. The frequency domain impedance (induced voltage ,

injected current) of the lens was recorded in real time using a

fast Fourier analyzer (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA). At

high frequencies, the magnitude of the lens impedance

asymptotes to the series resistance (Rs), which is the resistance

of all the GJs between the point of voltage recording and the

surface of the lens. Rs (kiloohms [KX]) was measured at multiple depths in lenses of WT and AQP0DC/DC mice; curve

fitting of the data with Equation 1 was done to determine the

underlying effective intracellular resistivities (RDF and RMF KX/

cm). These are directly proportional to the radial component

of GJ coupling resistance.

to the microelectrode. Intracellular pressure was measured at

four to five depths for each lens. For each genotype, data from

at least eight lenses were pooled. By curve-fitting Equation 3 to

the pooled data, the average pressure gradient was estimated.

The quadratic r-dependence of pressure suggests the transmembrane entry of water into fiber cells is essentially uniform with depth into the lens.53 The change in the slope of the r-dependence at r  b is thought to occur because the number of open GJ channels is different in the MF relative to
DF.

Western Blotting
Fiber cell membrane proteins of WT and AQP0DC/DC lenses were isolated by extraction with 4M-urea buffer (4 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0; 5 mM EDTA, 4M-urea). Western blotting was done as previously described.11,17 Antibodies to Cx46 and Cx50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) were used. Immunoreaction to an antibody was detected using an alkaline phosphatase kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA).

Statistical Analysis
Student's t-test was performed using a statistical software (SigmaPlot 10; Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). P values 0.05 were considered significant.

RESULTS
Lens Transparency and Focusing
We imaged WT and AQP0DC/DC mouse lenses at P10, under the dark field, to assess transparency. Compared to age-matched WT lenses, AQP0DC/DC lenses showed a reduction in transparency and changes in optical distortion (Fig. 1). No cataract was evident at P10 lenses of AQP0DC/DC mice. The electron microscopy grid pattern magnified by WT lenses produced a barrel deformation, called positive barrel distortion aberration, throughout. In this deformation, the straight lines curve inward

similar to the shape of a barrel. This curvature happens because there is a decrease in the magnification of the image as the object gets farther from the center (optical axis) of the lens. The grid-focusing pattern by the AQP0DC/DC lens showed an abnormal, much-distorted grid-line pattern and displayed two distinct zones. Zone I in the cortex showed a barrel distortion aberration as in the WT lenses, and zone II, at the lens nucleus, showed abnormal barrel distortion aberration compared with WT lens nucleus.
GJ Coupling in the Lenses of AQP0DC/DC Mice
Aquaporins and GJ channels in the fiber cells are important components of the lens microcirculation and homeostasis. Disruption of the lens microcirculation leads to loss of lens transparency and formation of cataract.8,35,39,55-57 To elucidate the mechanisms by which the presence of end-cleaved AQP0, in the absence of intact AQP0, causes loss of transparency, optical distortion, and cataracts (Fig. 1) and modulates GJ channel function,17 we investigated GJ coupling conductance and HP in lenses from the mouse model AQP0DC/DC.
In a previous study on age-related changes in C57 mouse lenses,47 GJ coupling conductance and HP were measured in 3to 5-day-old WT lenses. The MF coupling conductance was 27 Siemens per square centimeter (S/cm2) as compared to 5.2 S/ cm2 measured here in 10- to 13-day-old WT lenses. By 60 days of age, WT lens MF coupling has declined and pressure increased to a relatively stable value of about 0.8 S/cm2 and 350 mm Hg.47 There appears to be a rapid decline in coupling conductance during early development. If that decline is exponential, the time constant would be about 4 days. We were therefore careful to age match the WT and AQP0DC/DC mouse lenses as closely as possible at 10 to 13 days. As shown in Table 1, coupling conductance per area of cell-to-cell contact of DF decreased significantly to 0.91 S/cm2 (P < 0.005) compared to WT lenses (1.47 S/cm2). However, the coupling conductance (Gi) of MF decreased dramatically to 0.66 S/cm2 compared to that of WT (P < 0.0001), which was 5.2 S/cm2 (Table 1). These values were based on the best-fit curve (Equations 1 and 2) to RS data shown in Figure 2. The data were collected from seven to eight lenses of each genotype. Loss of 17 amino acids at the C-terminal end of AQP0 in AQP0DC/DC mice caused a significant decrease in radial coupling conductance (1.6-fold) in the DF and ~8-fold in the MF (Fig. 2; Table 1).
HP in the Lenses of AQP0DC/DC Mice
The data on the radial distribution of intracellular pressure were fit with Equation 3 to determine the pressure at the lens surface (pi[a]) at the transition from differentiating fiber cells to mature fiber cells (pi[b]) and at the lens center (pi[0]; Fig. 3; Table 2). Both pi(0) and pi(b) increased in the AQP0DC/DC mouse lenses compared to WT, in line with the increased

coupling resistance. However, pi(b) and pi(0) increased by 1.5-fold (P <0 .01) and two-fold (P < 0.0001), respectively, compared to the WT. The latter was significantly less than the increase in MF coupling resistance, which was about eightfold.
In a previous study,47 HP at the center of 3- to 5-day-old WT lenses was 62 mm Hg, so the increase in WT lens pressure between about 4 and 11 days of age was 1.6-fold, whereas the MF coupling conductance decreased from 27 S/cm2 to about 5.2 S/cm2, or ~5-fold. Thus, developmental changes in GJ coupling and pressure have a pattern similar to the changes in 11-day-old lenses due to the AQP0DC/DC mutated lenses relative to age-matched WT lenses. Both changes involve a large decrease in MF coupling conductance accompanied by a much more modest increase in central pressure. Could the Cterminal deletion have simply accelerated normal early developmental changes? We address this question in the Discussion section, but we suspect the answer is no, since the

mutation-induced changes lead to the rapid formation of cataracts by P15, whereas age-dependent developmental changes lead to transparent lenses that can be stable for the life of the animal.
Expression of Lens Fiber Cell Connexins in AQP0DC/DC Mice
To find out whether the decreased coupling conductance observed in the AQP0DC/DC lenses could be due to a decrease in GJ protein expression, we looked at the expression levels of the major lens connexins, Cx46 and Cx50. Immunoblotting of total lens membrane proteins of P10 pups of WT and AQP0DC/DC mice was performed (Fig. 4). Equal quantities of the membrane proteins were immunoblotted using Cx46 and Cx50 antibodies. Western blotting and protein quantification studies showed no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05) in the expression levels of Cx46 or Cx50 between WT and AQP0DC/DC lenses. Thus, the decreased GJ conductance and increased HP in AQP0DC/DC mouse lenses indicate that C-terminal end-cleaved AQP0 expression caused either

reorganization of GJs at the membrane or reduced the open probability of GJ channels.
DISCUSSION
We investigated GJ coupling and HP in lenses expressing only end-cleaved AQP0 in their fiber cells. In a normal lens, the outer cortex contains intact AQP0; the presence of end-cleaved AQP0 begins at the inner cortex and gradually increases toward the lens center (mouse44 and human2). Our data show a decrease in GJ coupling conductance and an increase in HP in AQP0DC/DC lenses relative to age-matched WT lenses. Our studies were conducted in lenses of recently born mice (P10), since the AQP0DC/DC lenses become cataractous by P15.
Newborn WT mouse lenses are undergoing rapid developmental changes.47 At birth, GJ coupling conductance is remarkably high but rapidly declines to the adult level (estimated time constant of about 4 days). The initial high level of coupling might occur to facilitate the movement of developmental signals, such as growth factors, throughout the lens. The process, however, appears to be self-limiting, as some signal induces rapid closure of GJ channels, particularly those of the MF. The expression of AQP0DC/DC instead of AQP0 appears to significantly disrupt the normal developmental program. Our data suggest the interaction of the C-terminus of AQP0 with GJs regulates coupling conductance, which appears to be one important aspect of the developmental program.
Ultrastructural studies have shown that loss of the Cterminal end of AQP0 correlates with the formation of large areas of thin junctions in WT lenses.14,58 GJ coupling measurements showed a significant reduction in coupling in the mature fiber cells relative to differentiating fiber cells in WT mice.29,31,32,34 Intracellular ion and water fluxes are both mediated by GJs,53 consistent with several studies on mutant or gene knockout mouse lenses that reported a decrease/ increase in GJ coupling,24,34,37 causing a commensurate increase/decrease in intracellular HP.24,34,37 In the AQP0DC/DC lenses, the reduction in radial GJ conductance could be due to the formation of large areas of thin junctions from the outer cortex to the nucleus by the end-cleaved AQP0 in the fiber cells. This may have altered the formation of GJs, as observed in the WT inner cortical and nuclear regions by AFM studies.49,59 This reduction in GJ coupling is likely to be the cause of increased HP.
Water permeability studies using AQP0DC/DC fiber cell membrane vesicles did not show any significant change;15 however, there was an increase in CTCA, possibly due to the formation of large areas of thin junctions since these lenses expressed end-cleaved AQP0 throughout.15 Normally, thin junction formation occurs at a higher level in the lens nucleus after the posttranslational N- and C-terminal cleavage of AQP0.49,58,59 The results presented here show that the loss of AQP0 C-terminus significantly reduces GJ coupling in both differentiating and mature fiber cells. The decrease in coupling conductance without a measurable change in connexin expression may be due to plaque reorganization in the fiber cells. However, the alternative hypothesis that there is a reduction in the open probability of GJ channels is not ruled out.
In AQP0DC/DC lenses, HP is not increased nearly as much as the coupling is reduced. This pattern is similar to changes in GJ coupling and HP during normal development. However, a normal 2-month-old lens has an MF coupling conductance of 0.8 S/cm2 and a central HP of 349 mm Hg,47 whereas the AQP0DC/DC lenses at 11 days of age have a MF coupling conductance of 0.7 S/cm2 and a central HP of 200 mm Hg. This

implies there is less pressure-driven water flow in the AQP0DC/DC lenses, so a loss of the C-terminus might cause developmental effects that reduce ion transport, leading to reduced fluid circulation in these lenses. This could be a contributing factor for the lenses developing opacities and distortion aberration (Fig. 1). However, the presence of normal AQP0 is also important for the structure of the lens, so structural distortions may contribute to opacities and distortion aberration in AQP0DC/DC lenses.
A recent investigation of AQP0/ lenses expressing only 50% of AQP0 in the fiber cell membrane showed an opposite effect, with an increase in GJ conductance and a decrease in HP.24 This could be due to the loss of 50% of AQP0 resulting in more surface area in the broad faces of fiber cell plasma membrane, enabling the formation of more functional GJ plaques. The presence of end-cleaved AQP0 and formation of thin junctions may be one important factor in the distribution of GJs and their radial coupling conductance.
In conclusion, GJs appear to play a critical role in early lens development. Data presented here suggest the spacial distribution of intact and C-terminal end-cleaved AQP0 from the cortex to the nucleus is critical for proper GJ channel development. Disruption of normal GJ developmental changes may cause the early onset of P15 cataracts seen in AQP0DC/DC lenses.

Background: To elucidate the clinical presentation, antimicrobial susceptibility, and prognostic factors of monomicrobial Aeromonas bacteremia in order to determine the most effective optimal therapy. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the medical records of Aeromonas bacteremia patients for the period January 2000 to December 2013 in a retrospective multi-center study. Results: A total of 336 patient records were reviewed, with 242 having community-acquired bacteremia. The major clinical infections were of the hepatobiliary tract (50.6%) and peritonitis (18.5%), followed by primary bacteremia (17.9%). The infections usually occurred in patients with malignancy (42.3%), hepatic cirrhosis (39.3%), or diabetes mellitus (25.6%). High antimicrobial-resistance rates (15.5% for ceftriaxone, 15.5% for piperacillin/tazobactam) were noted. However, resistance to carbapenem and amikacin was only 9.8% and 3.0%, respectively. Aeromonas hydrophila (58.9%) was the most common pathogen, followed by Aeromonas caviae (30.4%). The severity of A. caviae bacteremia cases were less than that of A. hydrophila or Aeromonas veronii bacteremia (P <0.05). A. hydrophila showed higher antimicrobial resistance than did other Aeromonas species (P <0.05). Patients with hospital-acquired bacteremia were more likely to have severely abnormal laboratory findings and relatively high antimicrobial-resistance rates. Mortality was associated with metastatic cancer, shock, delayed use of appropriate antimicrobial agents, increased prothrombin time, and increased creatinine level (P <0.05). Conclusions: Aeromonas species should be considered one of the causative agents of bacteremia in patients with intra-abdominal infections or malignancies. Although ceftriaxone-resistant Aeromonas bacteremia was not statistically related to mortality in this study, it was associated with severe clinical manifestations and laboratory abnormalities. Appropriate antibiotics, including carbapenem, should be administered early, especially in Aeromonas bacteremia patients with shock and impaired renal function.

Introduction
Aeromonas species, belonging to the genus Aeromonas, are oxidase-producing Gram-negative rods that can grow on MacConkey agar and ferment carbohydrates [1]. These aquatic microorganisms have been associated with a variety of human diseases [1]. Aeromonas species are proliferative and omnipresent in both fresh water and soils [2], and are occasionally isolated from the feces of healthy people [3]. Among 14 known species identified in the genus Aeromonas, many, although not all, are considered to be pathogenic [4]. More than 85% of Aeromonas-implicated clinical diseases are caused by the Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas caviae, and Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria [2]. These infections are acquired in both community and hospital settings, and both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients are susceptible. Aeromonas species can cause invasive and fatal infections in immunocompromised hosts and have been recognized as a serious threat to human beings [4].
The Aeromonas infection-related disease spectrum in humans has expanded; it now includes acute gastroenteritis, bacteremia, pancreatitis, hepatobiliary-tract infections, soft-tissue infections, indwelling-device-related infections, brain abscesses, meningitis, endocarditis, pleuropulmonary infections, peritonitis, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome [1-8]. The most common underlying conditions known to be associated with Aeromonas bacteremia are malignancy and hepatobiliary diseases [5]. Aeromonas spp. tend to produce at least three -lactamases, namely a penicillinase, cephalosporinase, and carbapenemase, which are all chromosome-encoded [6]. Nevertheless, to date, antibiotic resistance has not been a major problem for strains isolated from the environment. In contrast, clinical studies of Aeromonas infections are relatively rare, and the relevant antibiotic susceptibility profile, accordingly, remains vague. Previous studies have attempted to identify risk factors; however, those studies considered only a few risk factors and resistance to a limited number of antimicrobials [2, 7, 8]. Aeromonas bacteremia in patients with cirrhosis or malignancy has been found to be associated with a higher mortality rate than bacteremia caused by other organisms [8]. The present study is the largest retrospective clinical investigation to analyze various data on monomicrobial Aeromonas bacteremia.
The objectives of this study were to elucidate the clinical characteristics of Aeromonas bacteremia and to scrutinize the antimicrobial susceptibility of Aeromonas to optimal therapy. We also aimed to identify risk factors for mortality in patients with Aeromonas bacteremia.

Material and Methods
1. Patients We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients
who were diagnosed with Aeromonas bacteremia between January 2000 and December 2013 in multiple centers (Samsung Medical Center [Seoul], Dankook University Hospital [Cheonan], Dong-A University Hospital [Busan], and Jeju University Hospital [Jeju]). Patient records and information were anonymized and de-identified prior to analysis. Institutional review board approval was obtained for retrospective evaluation of the patients (DKUH 2015-01-014).
Aeromonas bacteremia was defined as the presence of an Aeromonas-positive blood culture, with concomitant signs and symptoms of infection. When the patient's blood culture yielded only one type of pathogen, monomicrobial bacteremia was diagnosed; when more than one type of pathogen was identified, the diagnosis of polymicrobial bacteremia was made. We included only patients with monomicrobial bacteremia in our analysis. Hospital-acquired infections were defined as bacteremic episodes detected at least 72 h after admission in patients who showed no clinical evidence of bacteremia on admission.
Information on age, sex, underlying disease, blood laboratory data, culture results, probable portals of entry, type of antimicrobial agents for treatment, type of medical procedure during treatment, and clinical outcome was collected for each of the patients. Illness severity and comorbidity at the patients' first presentation with bacteremia to the hospital were graded using the Pitt bacteremia score [5, 9] and Charlson's weighted comorbidity index [5], respectively. Patients with Aeromonas bacteremia were surveyed for concomitant infection foci; those lacking such foci were classified as having primary bacteremia.
2. Antimicrobial susceptibility test Aeromonas isolates were obtained by processing of blood
culture samples in a BACTEC Model 9240 (BD Diagnostic Instrument Systems, Sparks, MD, USA) or BacT/ALERT 3D (bioMerieux. Inc., Haselwood, MO, USA). Aeromonas was identified by means of a standard identification card. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates was carried out via an automated system at each hospital. Quality-control protocols and minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints (MICs) were used in compliance with the standards established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [10].

3. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were carried out in SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables were expressed as the mean and standard deviation (SD) or median (range) according to their homogeneity. The categorical variables were compared using the Chi-Square test or Fisher s exact test (when necessary). The quantitative variables were compared using the Student-Fisher t test or analysis of variance. The risk factors for infection-related mortality were evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Factors with a P-value of 0.2 in the univariate analysis, excepting those considered to be strongly associated with other variables, were entered into the multiple logistic regression analysis. A value of P <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
1. Patient characteristics Eight-hundred-and-twenty-four cases of Aeromonas bacte-
remia were enrolled, among which 488 cases of polymicrobial Aeromonas bacteremia were observed. The remaining 336 monomicrobial Aeromonas bacteremia cases were included in this study (Table 1). The major causes of bacteremia were hepatobiliary tract infections (50.6%), followed by peritonitis (18.5%) and primary bacteremia (17.9%). Community-acquired bacteremia was shown in 242 cases (72.0%). The infections usually occurred in patients with solid-organ malignancy (42.3%), hepatic cirrhosis (39.3%), diabetes mellitus (25.6%), or leukemia (7.1%). Concomitant anticancer chemotherapy had been administered in 74 patients (22.0%). The three leading clinical manifestations were fever (38.7%), septic shock (25.6%), and altered consciousness (17.9%). Initial usage of inappropriate antimicrobial agent was noticed in 140 cases. One-hundred-and-sixty-six cases showed antimicrobial-agent combination therapy. The median duration of treatment was 10 days. In 272 cases, antimicrobial-agent initiation within 6 h of symptom manifestations was observed. Fifty patients died of Aeromonas bacteremia.
2. Seasonal distribution of Aeromonas bacteremia A trend toward more frequent occurrence during the warm-
er seasons (May to October; n = 232; 69.0%) was observed. Most of the community-acquired infections (176 of 242, 72.7%) occurred during these seasons (Fig. 1).

3. Differences in clinical characteristics and antimicrobial susceptibility between species A. hydrophila was less frequently involved in primary bacte-
remia and was more frequent in skin and soft-tissue infections and peritonitis (P <0.05) than in infections with other species (Table 2). A. caviae was less prevalent in skin and soft-tissue infections (P = 0.009) and more prevalent in primary bacteremia (P = 0.017) than in infections with other species. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) was more common with A. hydrophila infections (50/62 SBP cases). Pneumonia was more common with Aeromonas salmonicida infection (P <0.001). Hospital-acquired infections were more common among patients with A. caviae and A. salmonicida infections (P <0.001).

Underlying diseases differed according to species: A. veronii and A. sorbia infections were more frequent in liver cirrhosis; A. caviae and A. sorbia infections were more frequent in patients with solid-organ cancers; A. salmonicida infections were more common in those with leukemia. Moreover, A. caviae infections occurred more frequently during concurrent chemotherapy (P = 0.004), and A. hydrophila tended to be present in cases of shock (P <0.001). Liver function test results were worse in cases with A. hydrophila infection than in cases with infections involving other species (P = 0.001).
A. hydrophila accounted for 58.9% of cases; there were 102 cases of A. caviae (30.4%), 20 cases of A. sobria (6.0%), 10 cases of A. veronii (3.0%), and six cases of A. salmonicida (1.7%) infections (Table 2).
All 336 isolates were included in the analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility. More than 90% of cases were susceptible only to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, gentamicin, and amikacin. Among the five distinct Aeromonas complexes identified, A. hydrophila was more often resistant to antimicrobial agents. The exceptions were the Aeromonas isolates from Jeju University Hospital: these 20 (100%) cases were susceptible to piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.
4. Comparison of community-acquired and hospitalacquired Aeromonas bacteremia No clustered cases of hospital-acquired Aeromonas bactere-
mia were noted. Individual cases developed within 4-42 days (median: 10 days) after admission. Community-acquired Aeromonas bacteremia differed from hospital-acquired bacteremia in several aspects (Table 3).
A total of 242 patients had been diagnosed with community-acquired Aeromonas bacteremia. Univariate analysis re-

vealed statistically significant differences in age, ICU admission, hospital stay, site of infection, underlying diseases (liver cirrhosis, leukemia), concurrent chemotherapy, presence of a central line catheter, blood laboratory results (hemoglobin, prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], aspartate transaminase [AST], bilirubin, and glucose), presence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, species differences, proportion of initial discordant antimicrobial agent use, initiation of appropriate antimicrobial agent after 6 h, and antimicrobial resistance between community- and hospital-acquired Aeromonas bacteremia. Hepatobiliary infections (P = 0.003) and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (P = 0.038) were more common in community-acquired bacteremia; primary bacteremia (P = 0.003), pneumonia (P = 0.002), and catheter-related infection (P = 0.000) were more common in hospital-acquired bacteremia. Liver cirrhosis was the common underlying condition in community-acquired bacteremia (P = 0.023), whereas leukemia (P = 0.001) and concurrent chemotherapy (P = 0.002) were the common underlying conditions in hospital-acquired bacteremia. The laboratory findings were more abnormal in cases of hospital-acquired bacteremia (P = 0.009 to 0.045).
5. Antimicrobial therapy Empirical therapy. Twelve patients died of septic shock with
multi-organ failure before appropriate antimicrobial agent treatment could be started. A total of 140 cases were started with inappropriate antibiotics; half of the patients (166) were administered combination therapy, while 56 were placed on aminoglycoside combination therapy. The most common initially administered antimicrobial agents were ceftriaxone and metronidazole (100 cases). Ceftriaxone was the single most common agent in the empirical therapy for Aeromonas bacteremia (61.1%).
Definitive therapy. The therapeutic efficacy of the definitive therapy was evaluated in 310 patients. There were no statistically significant differences in mortality between monotherapy and combination therapy (P >0.050).
Time to the start of antimicrobial agents. There was a statistically significant difference in mortality between the 6 h prior to and after the initiation of appropriate antimicrobial agents (P = 0.049).
6. Ceftriaxone resistance Among 336 cases of Aeromonas monomicrobial bacteremia,
284 (84.5%) had been caused by ceftriaxone-susceptible (CS) Aeromonas bacteremia and 52 (15.5%) by ceftriaxone-resis-

tant (CR) Aeromonas bacteremia (Table 3). The CS and CR Aeromonas bacteremia groups had similar demographic characteristics. There was a higher rate of mortality in the CR Aeromonas bacteremia group, but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.088; Table 3). The CR Aeromonas bacteremia group showed a tendency to disease acquired in a hospital setting (P = 0.002).
7. Outcome analysis for non-survivors The overall mortality among the 336 patients was 15.0% (50
cases). Death occurred at a median of 10 days post-admission. Twelve patients died within 72 h of their arrival at the hospital. All of the non-survivors had experienced shock. Furthermore, according to univariate analysis, these cases manifested a higher rate of resistance to antimicrobial agents. A number of risk factors for Aeromonas bacteremia-related mortality were found in the multivariate analysis: metastatic cancer, shock, high Pitt bacteremia score, high Charlson's weighted comorbidity index, high prothrombin time, high serum creatinine level, and initiation of appropriate antimicrobial agents 6 h after manifestation of symptoms (P <0.05 for all variables; Table 4). The predicted Aeromonas monomicrobial bacteremia mortality rate was found to be closely related to the known Pitt bacteremia score.
Predicted mortality rate (%) = (Pitt bacteremia score  0.084 + 0.005)  100
Discussion
Our study included a large number of cases of monomicrobial Aeromonas bacteremia, with full laboratory and medical records; these were amenable to analysis and could provide useful information for better clinical practice.
The three major clinical categories of Aeromonas infection are hepatobiliary tract infection, peritonitis, and primary bacteremia. These have been identified in more than 80% of reported Aeromonas infections. An earlier study found that the most common underlying conditions associated with Aeromonas septicemia were malignancy (21-50%) and hepatobiliary diseases (15-54%) [2, 4, 7, 11-14], although healthy patients were also shown to be susceptible to Aeromonas infection. Likewise, underlying illness with malignancy, hepatobiliary diseases, and diabetes mellitus were frequently encountered in Aeromonas bacteremia in this study. As many as 25.6% of patients in the present study had diabetes mellitus, which was a significantly higher rate than that previously re-

ported 11% [5]. Our data suggested that individuals presenting with Aeromonas bacteremia should be evaluated for the possibility of underlying malignancy, hepatobiliary diseases, or diabetes mellitus.
Previous reports have shown that patients with Aeromonas bacteremia could be treated with one of the broad-spectrum -lactam agents, such as third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, and imipenem, or with fluoroquinolone alone [2, 5, 7]. However, antimicrobial resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (such as cefotaxime) in clinical Aeromonas isolates has been noted [1, 2, 4-7, 11, 12, 14-17]. Indeed, fluoroquinolone resistance is increasing, as evidenced by the ciprofloxacin-resistance rate of 14% that was previously reported [2]. In the current study, the rates of resistance to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem were 15.5, 10.1, and 9.8%, respectively. It has been shown that, for carbapenemase-producing Aeromonas strains, the MICs of imipenem were above 8 mg/L [6]. However, the clinical effect of the inducible carbapenemases in clinical Aeromonas species has not been clearly delineated as yet [2, 6]. One case study reported an imipenem-resistant A. veronii clinical isolate, recovered from a patient with cholangitis; this case also did not show any clinically significant carbapenem-resistance in Aeromonas species [18, 19]. A history of carbapenem use was associated with mortality in the present univariate analysis. This suggests that previous carbapenem use can induce resistance and thereby lead to a poor clinical outcome.
Based on the resistance rates found in our data, amikacin, gentamicin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin are reasonable antimicrobial therapy choices for treatment of Aeromonas infections. Ceftriaxone is the usual empirical treatment of choice for patients with hepatobiliary infections. Ceftriaxone was started as the initial treatment in most cases of suspected gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary infection identified in the present study. The high resistance patterns led to 41.7% of patients being treated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy. Additionally, ceftriaxone-resistant Aeromonas bacteremia groups showed severe clinical manifestations and laboratory findings. The only exceptions were the Aeromonas isolates from Jeju University Hospital, all of which (n = 20) were susceptible to piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin. Thus, geographic differences may affect resistance patterns. Recommendations for combination therapy in Aeromonas bacteremia have come from studies of a small number of cases with both polymicrobial and monomicrobial bacteremia [20, 21]. In contrast, in

the current study, there was no significant difference in the clinical outcomes of patients definitively treated with either monotherapy or combination therapy. However, we cannot recommend either monotherapy or combination therapy for treatment of Aeromonas bacteremia at this point, because the proportion of inappropriate initial therapy was high in our experience. Given the lack of available therapeutic options for Aeromonas bacteremia, well-controlled clinical trials of combinations of existing antibiotics are urgently needed.
A. caviae is the most frequent pathogen causing Aeromonas bacteremia in Japan [19, 22], whereas A. hydrophila, followed by A. veronii biovar sobria, is the most common Aeromonas species causing bacteremia in Taiwan [23]. In our study, A. hydrophila was the most common Aeromonas species caus-

www.icjournal.org

ing bacteremia, followed by A. caviae, which is interesting, as Korea is geographically located between China and Japan. Therefore, additional epidemiological studies are required in order to establish the bacteriology of different types of Aeromonas infections in different regions. Isolates need to be collected, and the links between genetic factors and geographic areas should be analyzed. This is relevant, as in this study, A. hydrophila showed higher antimicrobial resistance and resulted in greater clinical severity than did the other Aeromonas spp. (P <0.05).
The mortality rates among patients with Aeromonas bacteremia range from 28 to 63% in the literature [1, 2, 4, 7, 18, 24, 25]. However, our study showed a significantly lower mortality rate (14.9%). In our cases, patients with skin and soft-tissue infection had worse clinical outcomes than did those with other secondary bacteremia; this finding was statistically significant only in univariate analysis. Bacterial peritonitis has been associated with an approximate 15% mortality rate, and necrotizing fasciitis with a higher mortality rate of 50% (one death in two patients). In our study, the number of patients with necrotizing fasciitis was 14. We postulated that the lower mortality rate in our study was associated with a low prevalence of soft-tissue infection as well as a relatively low rate of liver cirrhosis [7]. Inappropriate therapy has been regarded as a prognostic factor in patient outcomes [26], and was correlated with mortality in this study.
The main limitation of this study was its retrospective design. As such, specific information on the antibiotic types (cefepime and aztreonam) used was missing from the medical records. Furthermore, our study was conducted at four tertiary hospitals and examined data spanning 14 years. During that time, medical and microbiological environments changed, and thus our results cannot be generalized to all other hospitals.
In conclusion, patients with Aeromonas bacteraemia can be treated with carbapenem, ceftazidime, or fluoroquinolone. Although Aeromonas species showed a higher resistance rate to ceftriaxone, Aeromonas bacteremia was correlated with a relatively low mortality rate compared with previous studies. All of the non-survivors experienced shock. Ceftriaxone-based metronidazole combination treatment might not be recommendable as an initial empirical therapy, in particular due to the high antimicrobial resistance rates to various agents in septic-shock patients. In patients with septic shock, carbapenem-based aminoglycoside combination treatment may also not be considered as an initial empirical therapy, due to the high antimicrobial-resistance rates to various agents present

in septic shock. Considering the risk factors for mortality, adequate antibiotics should be given early, especially to patients with shock and impaired renal function. In order to make recommendations for definitive therapy based on available susceptibility results, further studies with larger numbers of cases and supportive experiment, such as DNA sequencing, are warranted.

The Korean influenza national immunization program was first established as an interim program in 1997, administering the influenza vaccine to low-income elderly adults. In 2005, the program assumed its present form of providing free influenza vaccination to adults aged 65 years. After turning over the influenza vaccination for elderly adults to the private sectors in 2015, the influenza vaccination coverage rate among this population increased to >80%. In addition, after the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic crisis, the vaccine was domestically produced. By reaching a 75% vaccination coverage rate in the target groups, it was possible to put an end to the influenza pandemic and fix the shortcomings of the system that existed at that time. The influenza vaccination program, provided free of cost, was extended to include infants aged <12 months in 2016 and 59 months in 2017 in order to reduce the influenza burden in these populations. However, the vaccine effectiveness remains low despite the high vaccination rates in elderly adults. Therefore, several areas, such as the adoption of quadrivalent influenza vaccine, adjuvanted influenza vaccine, and high-dose influenza vaccine and the expansion of vaccination target groups, still need to be addressed.

Introduction
Influenza virus causes substantial social and economic losses not only by affecting job performance in healthy adults but also by increasing morbidity and mortality in high-risk groups, such as elderly adults, people with chronic conditions, infants, and pregnant women. In addition to causing annual outbreaks during winter, the influenza virus can undergo antigenic drift/ shift and has the potential to cause worldwide pandemics every

10-40 years. Therefore, from a public health perspective, influenza is a disease that requires international surveillance and preparation [1]. To reduce the disease burden of influenza virus and improve public health, South Korea has implemented, with excellent results, the national immunization program (NIP) for influenza. Among the countries that are a part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, South Korea had the second highest influenza vaccination rate for people aged 65 years in 2013 [2]. However, to our knowledge, accurate

summaries on the origins of influenza NIP and the changes made to reach its present form do not exist. Therefore, we sought to outline the course of influenza NIP transformation since its inception in 1997 and to review its present status.
History and present status of the NIP
1. NIP objectives and structure The primary objectives of influenza NIP are to minimize the
disease burden of influenza by providing priority vaccination to high-risk groups and to build a system capable of responding to influenza pandemic. The NIP's management structure is comprised of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC); provincial and city public safety units; and city, district, and county public health units. The following are the responsibilities of public health units: determining vaccine demands/requirements, conducting vaccination programs, and recording and reporting individuals' vaccination statuses and any adverse events (AEs). The provincial and city public safety units oversee the achievements of public health units concerning the vaccination and act as a bridge in conducting epidemiological investigations of AEs and reporting the results to the KCDC. The role of the KCDC is to manage the vaccine supply and registration, to review epidemiological investigations of

vaccine-related AEs, and to manage compensations [3-17].
2. Main changes in the timing, target groups, and methods of influenza NIP When the NIP for influenza was established in 1997, the rec-
ommended period for vaccination was from September to October. However, because of the delayed occurrence of influenza outbreaks, the vaccination period was later changed to September-November in 2002 and September-December in 2004. Considering the fact that the effects of a vaccination last up to 6 months on average, the vaccination period was adjusted to October-December in 2005 and has remained so until now (except for the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 seasons when the vaccination period started early (September-December) to include the H1N1 influenza vaccine) [3-17]. In 2017, free vaccine recipients were expanded to cover young children from 6 months to <5 years old. As such, for those infants receiving their first twodose vaccination, their first dose was given in early September and the second dose was completed before the start of the season to develop sufficient immunity. Infants who reach 6 months of age after January 2018 will be allowed to receive free vaccinations until the end of April 2018 [17].
In the beginning, the priority group for influenza vaccination included adults aged 65 years and those with chronic health conditions. In 2002, the target group included healthcare pro-

viders and families of patients with chronic diseases. In 2003, pregnant women and people aged 50-64 years were included, and in 2004, infants and children aged 6-23 months and those who worked in avian flu response teams and related fields were also included. In 2010, the target group was extended to include children aged <5 years and people living with high-risk family members (Table 1). Currently, pregnant women are included in the World Health Organization's first-priority influenza vaccination group, but were not included in the NIP's influenza target group until 2003. Even then, vaccination was not recommended for pregnant women who were in their first trimester, except for high-risk cases. In the 2005-2006 season, influenza vaccination was recommended for all pregnant women [3-18]. During the 2016-2017 season, influenza instances were highly prevalent and rapidly widespread among students. Therefore, in an effort to counteract the risks accompanying communal lifestyles through frequent interactions with other individuals, all individuals aged 60 months to 18 years were included in the priority group for influenza vaccination in September 2017 [17].
In the 2017-2018 season, the NIP for influenza is recommended to people who are at a high risk for incidence of complications when infected with influenza virus (i.e., elderly adults aged 65 years; children aged 6-59 months; pregnant women; people with chronic health conditions, such as chronic heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, liver disease, kidney disease, neuromuscular disorders, blood neoplastic disorders, diabetes, and immunocompromised conditions, or those taking immunosuppressants; children between 6 months and 18 years old taking aspirin; and adults aged 50-64 years), who are at a high risk of transmitting influenza to high-risk groups (i.e., healthcare workers; people caring for infants <6 months old; people living with individuals who have chronic conditions, pregnant women), and for those with community lifestyles (i.e., children aged 60 months to 18 years old). As part of the avian influenza response strategy, vaccination has also been recommended to those who work in avian influenza response groups, poultry (chicken and duck) and pig farms, and related industries [17].
Influenza vaccination is not free of charge to all influenza NIP target groups. Until recently, influenza vaccination was provided free of charge only to elderly adults aged 65 years. In 1997, the influenza vaccination was free of charge only to low-income elderly adults. No clear record existed when was the exact season the influenza vaccination became free for all elderly adults aged 65 years, but it was likely during the 2005-2006 season, when the national financial support for the program

substantially increased, which previously operated only on municipal budgets [6]. In the 2016-2017 season, infants aged 6 months to <12 months were added to the free vaccination program, and the government reported a gradual extension of the free vaccination to young children [16]. During the 2017-2018 season, free vaccination services are expected to cover 2,140,000 young children from 6 months to <5 years old [17]. In the 2018-2019 season, eligible recipients for free vaccinations are expected to include elementary, middle, and high school students as part of the priority group for influenza vaccination.
In 1997, free vaccination for elderly adults was available only at public health units, which resulted in long waiting periods, inconvenience, and safety issues. Thus, to improve the accessibility, convenience, and safety of influenza vaccination, the NIP began to commission influenza vaccination to private health sectors in the 2015-2016 season [15]. As a result, the overall influenza vaccination rate among elderly adults aged 65 years increased from 73% to 80.9%, when compared to the 2014-2015 season. In particular, the influenza vaccination rate increased in elderly adults aged 85 years by approximately 13% (from 56.1% to 69.3%) [16]. Thus, the transition to private health sectors has been a fairly successful strategy in the improvement of influenza vaccination rates and safety of elderly adults aged 85 years, who are less likely to access group vaccinations through public health units (Fig. 1).
To ensure the safety of vaccination, an influenza vaccine-screening questionnaire was developed in 2006, after the development of adult screening questionnaire in 2005 [7]. When the live vaccine was adopted in the 2009-2010 season, questions related to it were added. Since the 2010-2011 season, all questionnaires have been combined, for use across all ages and types of vaccinations [10, 19].
3. Present status of influenza vaccine supply and uptake The amount of influenza vaccine supplied nationally has al-
most doubled, from 11,800,000 doses in the 2001-2002 season to approximately 24,380,000 doses in the 2017-2018 season. When the NIP for influenza was established, the required amount of the vaccine had to be imported; however, after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the influenza vaccine was produced domestically, and, at present, the domestic production meets approximately 70% of the vaccines required [17]. For adults aging 65 years, the government purchases vaccines through procurement contracts and then supplies them to public health centers and private clinics. For young children aged 6 months to <5 years, private clinics purchase vaccines inde-

pendently to reflect vaccine safety and vaccination convenience. From 2004, the government initiated the management of Internet-based monitoring of the vaccine supply status at public health units. In 2012 and 2015, the government implemented real-time services and developed vaccine supply systems for clinics and hospitals participating for NIP, respectively, thereby allowing for immediate response and management when vaccine shortage or supply problem occurs [3-17].
Based on data obtained from the vaccination registration system, the number of recipients of the influenza vaccine has more than tripled in 20 years, from 3,200,000 people in the 1997-1998 season to 9,890,000 in the 2016-2017 season. This number includes all those who received the influenza vaccine free of charge, but not all those who paid for the vaccine, as registration in the system is not mandatory for those ineligible to receive free vaccination. Considering the number of people who paid for the vaccine but were not registered in the system, the increase rate could even be higher. The vaccination rate for adults aged 65 years is continuously increasing because of the expansion of services to private clinics. During the 2016- 2017 season, 5,720,000 out of 6,940,000 eligible individuals (82.4%) were vaccinated. The vaccination for infants aged 6 months to <12 months was initiated in the 2016-2017 season, and among the 320,000 eligible infants, the vaccination rate reached 87.9% (280,000) during the first round and 87.6% (270,000) during the second round of vaccinations.

4. Influenza vaccination registration and AEs Until the 2011-2012 season, the hospital or doctor's office re-
ported data on vaccination registration and vaccine-related AEs to public health units, which then reported these to the KCDC. In July 2012, the vaccination registration systems were combined with the Integrated System for Disease Control/ Public Health (http://is.cdc.go.kr), so that physicians can report directly through this integrated system. In addition, patients or their care givers can report their vaccination and any AEs through the Vaccination Adverse Event Reporting System (https://nip.cdc.go.kr). If an AE is reported after vaccination, the epidemiological study team at the city/provincial level performs a basic epidemiological investigation, and then the epidemiological study team at the KCDC performs a more detailed investigation. The vaccination injury study team conducts an investigation of the injury and reports the results to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program committee. Once the committee has completed reviewing the reports and the required compensation, the results are reported to the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The Ministry of Health and Welfare then decides on the amount of compensation, notifies, and pays the patient through the KCDC.
The first four cases of suspected AEs after influenza vaccination were reported in 2002; since 2005, an average of 50 suspected AEs have been reported every year. In 2009 and 2010, when mass vaccination was conducted owing to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, 2,109 and 493 cases were reported to have

suspected AEs, respectively [20]. However, these AE reports only referred to symptoms occurring after the vaccination and not related to the reported adverse reaction to the vaccine. The first confirmed AE related to the seasonal influenza vaccine and compensated was a case of Guillain-Barr syndrome in 2004. From 2004 to 2016, only 12 cases of AEs have been confirmed to be related to the influenza vaccine [21, 22]. Aside from the Guillain-Barr syndrome, other reported AEs included peripheral neuropathic disease, cellulitis, and purulent myositis. A relationship between narcolepsy and adjuvanted vaccine has been consistently questioned; however, there have been no related cases reported within Korea to date. Only a single case, in 2012, was considered to be related to the influenza vaccine, after administration of the live vaccine [21, 22].
The number of reported cases of AEs for seasonal influenza vaccines is low. However, many suspected AEs have been reported for the H1N1 influenza vaccine, which was given to approximately 15,000,000 people to increase group immunity in at-risk populations over a short period of time [21, 22]. The reports included 12 cases of Guillain-Barr syndrome and 4 suspected cases of narcolepsy. However, the latter were found to be unrelated to the H1N1 influenza vaccine [21, 22], and the same result was confirmed in a study on soldiers [23].
5. Influenza immunization education and promotion program The standardization of the NIP for influenza, which was im-
plemented in 1997 as an interim program, began in 2002, with the publication of the Influenza Immunization Program Guidelines. Since 2005, further progress has been made, resulting in the efforts and cooperation of related experts, by establishing and distributing the present form of the "Immunization Target Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Management Guidelines" to city/district/county public health units [3-17].
Influenza immunization field education started in 2007 at the city/district/county level, by training new employees and information technology personnel performing the registration. In addition, as part of the government's plan of active response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, an Influenza Immunization Professional Education Program was established, targeting private and city/district/county-level healthcare agencies, and this has been operating since then. In addition, a structured online educational program has been operating since 2013, through the KCDC training system [24].
Immunization is a preventive measure conducted before the onset of an infectious disease, requiring the voluntary participation of the immunization program. The KCDC's promotion

activity of influenza immunization became full-fledged in 2004, with the establishment of the Immunization Control Team. In 2007, an online campaign was developed, and since 2011, the various programs have been providing influenza-related information and encouraging immunization through social network systems.
6. The pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccination program The H1N1 Influenza Vaccination Program, which started to
operate from 2009 to 2010, ended the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and addressed the shortcomings of the existing system. The first case of H1N1 influenza was confirmed in the United States on April 26, 2009. In Korea, the first case was confirmed on May 2, 2009; by mid-August, the rate of reported cases of influenza-like illness was more than 2.67/1,000 persons, which meets the criterion for an epidemic. By early October, H1N1 influenza had rapidly spread across local communities, centering in schools, and by late October, the numbers had reached their highest at 45.00/1,000 persons. Because at that time, the influenza vaccine was dependent on foreign supplies, it was difficult to raise immunity in the population in a short time span. Nevertheless, to minimize the widespread and to put an early end to the epidemic, work on the domestic production of H1N1 influenza vaccine began at the end of April 2009. On October 21, 2009, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety approved the H1N1 vaccine per individual without adjuvant, and on January 5, 2010, the H1N1 vaccine per group with adjuvant was also approved [25].
The government devised an immunization plan to achieve a 39% vaccination rate in the total population. In July 2009, the "H1N1 Influenza Immunization Planning Committee" was established. The committee's plan included creating a central influenza response team in the public health unit and providing immunization at healthcare agencies, schools, and public health units, under the supervision of local public health units [25]. Considering the level of H1N1 influenza immunity in various age groups, those at a high risk for infection and those who are at high risk for transmission were prioritized. From October 27, 2009, vaccination was administered in the following order: healthcare providers and military public service members, students (November 2009 to January 2010), infants and children aged 6-59 months (December 2009), and pregnant women (December 2009 to January 2010). Following these groups, soldiers (January 2010), residents of social welfare facilities (January 2010), elderly adults (January-February 2010), and people with chronic health conditions (January- February 2010) received the approved adjuvanted vaccine.

Figure 2. Targeted sequential influenza H1N1 immunization as a pandemic control strategy during the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic. *Data: Public Health Weekly Report.

From October 2009 to May 2010, approximately 14,750,000 doses of the H1N1 influenza vaccines were administered, which was 75.4% of the planned 18,890,000 doses. In December 2009, the number of influenza patients decreased steadily, and the H1N1 influenza epidemic ended with a total of 763,759 cases as of August 2010 (Fig. 2) [26].
Conclusion
The NIP for influenza overcame the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and many of its shortcomings by changing the vaccine supply control system and immunization registration and AE management systems and by delegating immunization to private healthcare agencies. With these improvements, the safety of the influenza vaccine has been confirmed, domestic vaccine production has been successfully established, and high vaccination rates have been achieved among infants aged 6 months to <12 months and elderly adults aged 65 years. However, the main problems that are unique to the influenza virus and vaccine, such as vaccine mismatching and low vaccine effectiveness in elderly adults and children, remain. Support/funding for influenza risk groups other than infants (6-59 months) and

elderly populations is also lacking, and a considerable influenza disease burden remains in Korea [27, 28]. As the target influenza vaccination rate among elderly adults has been achieved, the next step is to conduct further research to evaluate the most cost-effective type of vaccine (e.g., quadrivalent, adjuvanted, or high dose). The NIP for influenza has been operating for 20 years, with the primary objective of reducing the disease burden in high-risk groups. However, for high-risk groups, other than elderly adults and children aged 59 months, there has been very little control of immunization, resulting in a blind spot. Thus, a strategy should be formulated to improve the vaccination rate among the two high-risk groups: (1) pregnant women and (2) people with chronic health conditions, who most likely experience complications associated with influenza.

Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and Diffuse Lipomatosis: Case Report of a Rare Association

Abstract Lipomatosis is characterized by diffuse infiltration of adipocytes in a tissue. A young male patient presented for evaluation of unilateral limb swelling. On evaluation, he was found to have tuberous sclerosis complex with diffuse lipomatosis of the right leg. To the best of the authors' literature search, only two previous reports of association of tuberous sclerosis complex with diffuse lipomatosis were found. The molecular mechanisms behind the cooccurrence of these two entities have not been studied in detail. Abnormalities in lipolysis and lipogenesis pathway may underlie the cooccurrence of tuberous sclerosis complex and diffuse lipomatosis.
Keywords: Diffuse lipomatosis, macrodystrophica lipomatosis, tuberous sclerosis complex

Introduction
Lipomatosis is a group of conditions characterized by diffuse infiltration with adipose tissue. Histologically, lipomatosis is composed of normal adulttype adipocytes with no evidence of cellular pleomorphism. There have been only rare case reports of diffuse lipomatosis. Here, we report a case of diffuse lipomatosis with tuberous sclerosis complex.
Case Report
A 24yearold male presented with gradually progressive diffuse swelling of the right lower limb since childhood. It was not associated with any paresthesia or sensory/motor function impairment. Apart from limb swelling, there was history of multiple, asymptomatic facial papules since early childhood. His sister also had similar facial lesions and seizure disorder.
On physical examination, there was diffuse swelling of the right lower limb extending from the groin up to the mid leg [Figure 1]. Multiple dilated tortuous veins were seen on the right thigh and leg. No visible capillary or venous malformations could be appreciated. There were multiple firm, discrete, reddishbrown, telangiectatic papules on the face involving the nasolabial furrows and cheeks [Figure 2a]. Multiple ash leafshaped hypopigmented patches of variable sizes were seen on trunk [Figure 2b]. Soft,

skincolored papules were coalescing to form plaque on the left lateral trunk [Figure 2b]. On oral mucosal examination, dental pits and gingival fibromas were also seen [Figure 2a].
Fine needle aspiration smears from multiple passes from the right thigh swelling showed lobules of mature adipose tissue. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right lower limb, there was altered signal intensity (T1weighted hyper and T2weighted hyperintense) involving the musculature of all compartments of the right thigh and leg suggestive of fatty infiltration and multiple prominent, tortuous vessels suggestive of venous channels [Figure 3]. There was associated cortical thickening of right femur and tibia with anterior bowing deformity of femur. On Doppler scan, multiple incompetent perforators along great saphenous vein territory were noted.
Discussion
Diffuse lipomatosis is a rare tumorous condition characterized by progressive growth and extension of mature adipose tissue to involve the skeletal muscle of the trunk and extremities. Rarely, osseous involvement may also be a feature.[1] Its etiology is not known although genetic factors have been suggested. It is a benign entity and normally has no clinical significance except for the cosmetic disability. Young children are predominantly affected, however, presentation may become

apparent in adulthood. Our case had typical clinical features of diffuse lipomatosis, which was further confirmed by cytology and MRI.
The clinical differentials considered in our patient were Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, Proteus syndrome, Parkes-Weber syndrome, and macrodystrophica lipomatosa. However, there was no capillary, lymphatic, or arteriovenous malformation to suggest Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome or Parkes-Weber syndrome and epidermal naevi or cerebriform plantar naevi to suggest Proteus syndrome. Macrodystrophica lipomatosis is a close differential of diffuse lipomatosis with a few overlapping clinical and radiological features. However, macrodystrophica lipomatosis typically shows hypertrophy of nerves with

proliferation of fat on MRI. Other differences between these two conditions are listed in Table 1.
Multiple angiofibromas, shagreen patch, and more than three ash leaf macules fulfill the diagnosis of definite tuberous sclerosis complex in our case. To the best of our knowledge, there are only two previous reports of association of tuberous sclerosis complex with diffuse lipomatosis.[2,3] The case reported by Klein et al.[2] had lower limb involvement, whereas Alcazar et al.[3] reported dorsal transthoracic involvement.
Constitutive activation of mTORC1 (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1) is a major pathological consequence of mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 seen in tuberous sclerosis complex. Inhibition of mTOR pathway using rapamycin has been shown to be effective in treating various cutaneous manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex.[4,5] It has been shown that mTORC1 suppresses lipolysis, stimulates lipogenesis, and promotes fat storage.[6] In addition, activating mutations in PIK3CA, part of mTOR pathway acting upstream of TSC complex, has been found in facial infiltrating lipomatosis.[7]
Conclusion
In conclusion, the association of diffuse lipomatosis with tuberous sclerosis complex needs further assessment because it is difficult to explain the asymmetrical involvement of lipomatosis when all cells carry TSC mutation. Additional genetic mutations or complex pathways may be involved and requires further characterization.

ABSTRACT
Background and Aims : Subclavian vein (SCV) cannulation can be performed using either supraclavicular (SC) or infraclavicular (IC) longaxis approach under ultrasound guidance (USG). However, their relative efficacy remains debatable. The aim of this study was to compare these two approaches in terms of safety, ease, success rate, and record the incidence of complications. Methods: We studied 90 adult patients distributed into two groups of 45 each. Data regarding the time taken for first venous puncture, the time required for inserting the catheter, the total number of attempts, the incidence of guidewire misplacement, and other mechanical complications were compared using Student's ttest for quantitative data and Chisquare test for qualitative value. Results: Mean puncture time was significantly lesser in group SC than IC (Pvalue < 0.001). Mean catheter insertion time taken was also significantly less in group SC than IC (Pvalue = 0.003). The first attempt rate was higher in group SC than IC (P = 0.013). Guidewire misplacement was seen in the IC group, P = 0.001. No pneumothorax, haemothorax, or arterial puncture were noted in our study in any of the groups. Conclusion: We conclude that for rightsided SCV cannulation using USG in the long axis, the SC approach is superior to the IC approach in terms of overall ease of cannulation. It was associated with a relatively shorter procedure time, higher success rate in the first attempt, lesser incidence of guidewire misplacement, and other complications. It should be considered as an alternative approach to the IC approach in patients requiring central line insertion.

INTRODUCTION
Central vein catheter (CVC) insertion is necessary for longterm venous access especially in the sick patients and the patients undergoing a major operation. Longterm intravenous support through the subclavian vein (SCV) is preferred due to less restriction of neck mobility and the lesser frequency of thrombosis.[1] The blind landmark technique of SCV cannulation is associated with certain lifethreatening complications such as haemopneumothorax (<2%), catheter malposition (9.3%), and subclavian arterial puncture (0.5%).[2] So most recent studies advocate the use of ultrasound guidance (USG) for both internal

jugular vein (IJV) and SCV cannulation. CVC under direct vision using USG needs a lesser number of attempts, decreases the time required for insertion, and reduces complications like arterial puncture,

pneumothorax, and guidewire malposition.[3,4] The two approaches of SCV cannulation i.e. supraclavicular (SC) and infraclavicular (IC) have been described[5,6] and successfully attempted under USG for CVC insertion using the long axis (inplane) approach. However, the relative efficacy of one over the other remains a matter of debate as the studies evaluating the same are few. Therefore, we aimed this study to compare the USGguided longaxis SC and IC methods of SCV in terms of safety, ease, and success rate.
METHODS After the Institutional Ethical Committee approval and Clinical Trials Registry- India (CTRI) registration (CTRI/2018/05/013751), this project was undertaken in the department of anaesthesia over 1.5 years from starting of 2018 to late 2019. A total of 90 adult patients aged between 18 and 60 years, of both genders, with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-IV listed for elective surgery under general anaesthesia where CVC insertion was indicated, participated in the study. Patients included in the study were posted for neurosurgery, spine surgery, major abdominal surgery. Any patient having an infection at the puncture site, deranged coagulation profile, pneumothorax, uncontrolled hypertension, pulmonary disease, severe cardiac disease, distorted anatomy of the neck or clavicle, previous central line insertions, or not giving consent for the study was excluded.
The specifics of the procedure and risks involved were explained and written consent was taken from each participant. Patients were then randomly allocated to either of the two following groups by sealed envelope technique.
Group SC - Right SCV catheterisation by USG, longaxis SC approach (n = 45).

For USGguided SCV cannulation, participants were positioned supine with 10-15 headdown tilt with head turned slightly towards left. Their right arm was fully adducted and shoulders slightly pulled downwards [Figure 1]. Ultrasound Machine Vividtm iq GE Medical Systems (China) Co. Ltd, with a linear probe 12LRS at 413 MHz was used. The USG machine was positioned on the patient's left side and the anaesthesiologist performing SCV catheterisation was on the right. Another anaesthesiologist was there to record the data.
Under all aseptic precautions, SCV cannulation was done using the modified Seldinger technique. A sterile transducer cover was used to enclose the ultrasound probe and a sterile gel was spread over the tip of the probe. We used 16 G CertrifixR trio by BBraun in all patients for this study. The anaesthesiologist performing the procedure held the probe, located the site of puncture and then performed the SCV puncture under direct vision.
For SC approach, first, the IJV was located with USG probe and, then we moved the probe downwards keeping the IJV under vision until the IJV-SCV junction was located. At this point, the probe was moved 90 to obtain a longitudinal view of the SCV [Figure 2]. So, at the time of initiating the puncture, only the SCV draining into the brachiocephalic vein was visible on the ultrasound display. In the IC approach, by placing the linear USG probe approximately 1.0-1.5 cm below middle and medial onethird of the clavicle, we first located the SCV in the short axis. Then by rotating the probe along the axis of the vein and scanning the area slightly laterally and below the clavicle, the

Group IC - Right SCV catheterisation by USG, longaxis IC approach (n = 45).

After admission into the operating room, standard monitors including heart rate (HR), pulse oximetry (SpO2), electrocardiogram (ECG), and noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) were applied and peripheral venous access was established. After induction of general anaesthesia and before the start of surgery, the right SCV cannulation was performed in all the patients under USG by the same anaesthesiologist who had previously performed at least 30 procedures by both approaches.

union of the axillary vein and cephalic vein leading to the formation of the SCV was located. By placing the linear USG probe in line with the SCV, only the SCV was evident on the monitor [Figure 3].
The primary objective was to compare the mean puncture time, which was defined as the time taken from introduction of ultrasound probe on skin to aspiration of blood from vein. Secondary objectives were to compare the catheter insertion time, the number of attempts, incidence of complication like guidewire misplacement. Catheter insertion time was taken as time from the successful placement of the needle in SCV to successful catheter insertion (confirmed by aspiration of blood through the catheter). Attempts required, that is single attempt or multiple attempts (maximum three attempts), guidewire misplacement (guidewire not going into the brachiocephalic vein), mechanical complications like pneumothorax, haemothorax, and arterial puncture were recorded. After surgery (which lasted for 3-6 h), a portable chest Xray was obtained in all patients to confirm the position of the tip of catheter and to rule out any complications as mentioned.
The sample size was estimated based on a similar study done previously,[6] which included 98 patients. In that study, the mean puncture times in SC and IC groups were 36  60 s and 48  114 s (mean  SD), respectively. So, using a confidence level of 95% and power of study of 80% the minimum number of patients required was found to be 44 patients by using Open Epi software version 3.01 (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). So, to have better accuracy, we included 45 patients in each group. Descriptive statistics for quantitative variables are presented in terms of minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation (SD) for each group separately.

International Business Machine Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 26.0 was used for statistical analysis. For the variables that are of qualitative type, data are presented in terms of frequency/number/percentage under each group separately. The statistical significance of quantitative variables was determined by the Student ttest. And for qualitative data, a Chisquare test was applied. The P value of 0.05 was set as criteria for the level of statistical significance.
RESULTS
No significant difference was observed in the demographic profile of patients in both groups [Table 1]. The mean puncture time was significantly lesser in group SC compared to group IC, it being 29.87  8.89 s and 46.93  12.27 s, respectively (Pvalue <0.001) [Table 2]. The mean catheter insertion time taken was also significantly less in group SC as compared with group IC, it being 130.49  17.99 s and 140.02  11.26 s, respectively (Pvalue = 0.003) [Table 2]. Similarly, a lower percentage of patients needed multiple attempts for successful cannulation in group SC (4%) compared to group IC (22.2%) (P = 0.013) [Table 2]. Guidewire misplacement was not seen in the SC group, 0 (0%) versus 4 (8.9%) in the IC group, P = 0.001. No complications like pneumothorax, haemothorax, or arterial puncture were observed in any patients in our study.
DISCUSSION
Our study was aimed to appraise IC and SC approaches of SCV cannulation in terms of ease of catheterisation, that is, puncture time, catheter insertion time, number of attempts, the incidence of guidewire misplacement, and complications. In our study, the USGguided SC

approach for SCV cannulation had considerably lesser mean puncture time, mean catheter insertion time, and a lower percentage of patients needing multiple punctures. In the IC approach, SCV not only lies deeper than in the SC area but also is quite close to the clavicle. So acoustic shadow caused by clavicle may interfere in proper visualisation of SCV in the IC area as reported by Byon HJ et al.[6]

Initially, when the landmark approach was used, Anil Thakur et al.[7] comparing IC with SC approach of SVC found that access time which was the time between the first puncture until the successful placement of catheter in SC approach (4.30  1.02 min) was less compared to IC approach (6.07  2.149 min, P = 0.000). Also, the cannulation success rate was better with the SC approach (29 out of 30 vs. 27 out of 30) as compared with the IC approach. They found that the incidence of complications was comparable by both IC and SC methods for SCV cannulation. Further in the study by Czarnik et al.[8] three experienced anaesthesiologists (at least 20 SCV cannulations before starting the study) performed SCV cannulation using the landmark approach. They found the incidence of complications and success rate similar as in other techniques of central vein cannulations in mechanically ventilated patients.

A more recent study by Sidoti A et al.[9] and systematic review by Lalu MM et al.[10] showed a clear advantage of USGguided technique over anatomic landmarkbased technique for SCV cannulation, with lesser complications

and greater success rate. FrancoSadud R et al.[11] recommended that routine insertion of SCV should be done under USG in real time as it was shown to decrease the threat of mechanical complications, increase the overall procedure success rate and decrease the number of needle punctures compared with landmark technique. We have also used ultrasound in all our patients. None of the patients in either group had any major complications of the procedure like pneumothorax, haemothorax, and arterial puncture, in our study. Similar findings were reported in most studies[6,12] that had used USG for SCV cannulation.
As far as time to puncture the SCV is concerned we had got a significantly short mean puncture time in SC as compared with the IC approach. The USGguided visualisation of SCV is better[13] and easy[6] in the SC area as compared with the IC area. Byon HJ[6] also reported faster SCV cannulation by a SC approach in children. Similarly, studies by Prasad R et al.[5] and Raphael PO et al.[12] showed that puncture time was less in the SC approach to SCV cannulation. However, in both these studies time to obtain SCV view and time to puncture it were calculated separately. In our study, anaesthesiologist performing the procedure was not interrupted until successful venous puncture was achieved. Also, the average BMI of patients in both the study groups was around 22.2 kg/m2 [Table 1]. Such low BMI could also have contributed to lesser puncture time in our study. Stachura MR et al.[1] have shown that USG visualisation of SCV is affected if BMI is more than 30 kg/m2.
In our study, the number of patients requiring multiple attempts was higher in the IC approach. Studies mentioned above[4,6,12] also reported similar findings. In a study by Stachura MR et al.,[1] USGguided visualisation of the SCV in the long axis is better in the SC area as compared with the IC area. Also, they found that USGguided views of SC SCV on the right side was slightly better than on the left although the difference was not significant. We have catheterised right SCV by both approaches (SC and IC) in our study. This better visualisation might have resulted in a higher success rate in the first attempt. Similarly, the incidence of guidewire misplacement was also lower in the SC group. Both Byon HJ et al.[6] and Tripathy M et al.[13] in their study reported a significant number of guidewire misplacements in the IC group. In our study, we had four guidewire misplacements into the right IJV with the IC approach and none in the SC approach. A relatively short course of right SC SCV

into the brachiocephalic vein and downward direction of advancing needleguidewire might be the reason for this difference.
Various modifications of USGguided techniques for visualisation of SCV have been described in the literature. Zhong X et al.[14] had found that for SCV cannulation by IC route, a multiplanar approach using a combination of transverse, longitudinal, and oblique views along with Doppler is effective and safe. Gaus et al.[15] reported that insertion of central line at the junction of SCV and axillary vein would be technically easier and better for IC SCV cannulation visualisation.
The limitations of our study are that all SCV cannulations were performed on the right side. So, these results might not apply to left SCV cannulation. Secondly, since most participants were adult patients with average BMI, whether these findings apply to patients with higher BMI or special subgroups like infants, children, elderly remains to be seen. A study with much larger sample size may be needed to compare and evaluate these variables.
CONCLUSION
We conclude that for the rightsided SCV cannulation using USG in the long axis, the SC approach is superior to the IC approach in terms of overall ease of cannulation. SC approach was associated with a relatively shorter procedure time, higher success rate in the first attempt, lesser incidence of guidewire misplacement, and other complications. It should be considered as an alternative approach to the IC approach in patients requiring central line insertion.

Commentary: Ocular histoplasmosis and nocardiosis coinfection: A rare presentation
Systemic histoplasmosis is ubiquitous, and the causative fungus is found in the soil fertilized by birds, chicken, and bats.[14] Histoplasmosis is common in immunosuppressed individuals and may present with mild influenza, which often leads to granulomatous disease and can even progress to lifethreatening disease.[14] In developing countries such as India, it can mimic tuberculosis.[3,4] Ocular manifestations of systemic histoplasmosis include retinitis, choroiditis, optic neuritis, uveitis, and endophthalmitis.[14] Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS) may present with peripheral retinal or choroidal involvement called "histo spots," and they mostly have clear vitreous, unlike systemic histoplasmosis.[1,2] POHS is mostly immunologic. Choroidal neovascular membrane is a known complication of histo spots in POHS.[1,2]
Nocardia, on the other hand, is a bacterial infection that causes invasive disease involving skin, eyes, and lungs.[5,6] Every bodily organ can be affected by Nocardia.[59] Several studies conducted in southern India on Nocardia keratitis have found that initial diagnosis can be easily missed and delayed diagnoses were commonly encountered in these studies.[6,7] Studies from Hyderabad, India have concluded that Nocardia keratitis constitutes 1.7% of all bacterial keratitis cases.[6,7] Nocardia keratitis has a characteristic appearance on slitlamp examination.[6,7] Punctate epithelial erosions and anterior corneal stromal infiltrates are seen in wreath patterned appearance with adjoining satellite lesions.[6,7] Infiltrates can also be found in the midperiphery of cornea.[6,7] Nocardia scleritis and endophthalmitis have also been reported in literature.[69] Nocardia is a Grampositive, aerobic organism found in soil and infection is usually exogenous.[59] They are weak acidfast bacilli and can be picked up by Kinyoun's acidfast staining as well. Arial hyphae are also seen.[8,9]

In the present article, a rare case of coinfection of histoplasmosis and Nocardia has been presented in a 48yearold Indian man who was immunocompromised.[1] The patient presented with a conjunctival mass in the right eye and on histopathology, encapsulated bodies with bloated macrophages were observed, suggesting diagnosis of histoplasmosis.[1] Patient had past history of using systemic immunosuppressants and was taking oral steroids and tablet tacrolimus.[1] He had renal transplantation previously for mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis.[1] Additionally, he had history of fever, cough, and multiple abscesses on thigh with discharging sinuses. Computed tomography of thorax revealed bilateral lung nocardiosis.[1] Cerebral abscess was also noted on imaging.[1] Fineneedle aspiration cytology of lung nodule and thigh abscess revealed Nocardia farcinica infection, for which he was treated with systemic antibiotics and regulation of immunosuppressives.[1] Local amphotericin 0.15% eye drop was prescribed in the postoperative period for the right eye.[1]
This dual infection in an immunocompromised, postrenal transplant patient was a challenge as systemic antifungal medications could lead to a compromised kidney function.[1] Systemic infection by Nocardia with foci in lung, brain, and thigh complicated the situation further. In metastatic nocardiosis, antibiotics have to be added by the concerned physician/ internist for the best possible management. Cotrimoxazole sometimes work best in such a situation.[1] At the same time, baseline immunosuppressives have to be continued in the patient.[1] In such a situation, it is advisable for the patient to be admitted in the hospital.[1] The author (s) could have provided detailed neurological and complete systemic workup. Consideration to include concerned specialists for such complicated cases should also be kept in mind for the best possible management.[1]
As new infectious diseases are emerging, they continue to be among the leading causes of mortality.[10] Medical management and drug resistance have increased

tremendously in the last decade. Monitoring and evaluation under the supervision of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN)[10] for containment of various infections has come into existence.[10] Advances have been made in microbial detection and susceptibility systems.[10] Molecular methods are useful in situations where conventional methods fail to diagnose the causative organisms.[10]
It is a natural query for all of us that why there are multiple infections in immunosuppressed individuals. As in host cells, defense mechanisms are altered by CD4 cells, which are seen more in infected cases with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) involvement.[10] Follicular cells from the lymphoid tissue become susceptible to the infection even without involving CD4 cells, particularly in exogenous infections affecting skin, cornea, and so on. Lymphopenia, selective Tcell deficiency, decreased delayed hypersensitivity reaction on skin test, hypergammaglobulinemia (IgG, IgA, and IgM), and polyclonal activation of B cells can induce such infections. Majority of Nocardia species have mycolic acid in their cell wall and trehalose 66 dimycolate, a cord factor which is important for virulence.[5,6] The cord factor has been found to be interlacing with phagocytosis, by various macrophages in the lysosomes.[5,6]

Abstract: Eucalyptus trees, mostly native to Australia, are widely planted in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere for the production of wood and pulp. Worldwide surveys of diseases on these trees have yielded a large collection of Ceratocystis isolates from dying trees or from wounds on their stems. The aim of this study was to characterise these isolates and to consider their relatedness to each other. Culture appearance, morphological features and a distinctive fruity odour in all cultures were typical of species in the Ceratocystis fimbriata sensu lato (s. lat.) complex. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences for the combined ITS, t-1 and TEF1- gene regions revealed a genetically diverse group of isolates residing in a single large clade, that were distinct from all other species in the C. fimbriata s. lat. complex. Based on morphology and phylogenetic inference, the Eucalyptus isolates are recognised as closely related. The South African isolates are described here as a new species, C. eucalypticola.

Introduction
Eucalyptus species are mostly native to Australia, but have been widely planted in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere. This is because they are adapted to a wide range of different environments and are typically fast growing. It has further been suggested that the success of these trees as non- natives is due to the separation from their natural enemies (Wingfield et al. 2008, Roux & Wingfield 2009). The potential threat of pests and pathogens to the sustainability of eucalypt plantations in areas where they are not native is consequently great and of substantial concern to forestry industries globally (Old et al. 2003, Wingfield et al. 2008).
In order to understand and manage the threat of pests and pathogens to Eucalyptus species grown as non-natives and in plantations, tree health surveys are undertaken regularly. Amongst the pathogens that have been found on these trees, a Ceratocystis sp. in the C. fimbriata s. lat. complex causes serious disease problems in Brazil, the Republic of Congo, Uganda, and Uruguay (Laia et al. 1999, Roux et al. 2000, 2001, 2004, Barnes et al. 2003a). Various other Ceratocystis species in the C. fimbriata s. lat. complex have also been found on naturally occurring or artificially induced wounds on the stems of trees, in various parts of the world. Some of these have been shown to be cryptic taxa that have been provided with names (van Wyk et al. 2007, 2008, 2010a, Rodas et al. 2007, Heath et al. 2009, Kamgan Nkuekam et al. 2012). Several species are thought to be pathogens, while

the role of others in tree health is not known. The genus Ceratocystis comprises a diverse group of
fungi, including saprophytes causing blue-stain of lumber and serious pathogens that cause mortality (Kile 1993). The genus is typified by C. fimbriata s. str. that is a pathogen restricted to root crops, specifically sweet potato (Engelbrecht & Harrington 2005). Ceratocystis fimbriata s. lat. represents a diverse assemblage of isolates, some of which have been treated as distinct taxa defined based on phylogenetic inference, morphological differences, and mating behaviour (Barnes et al. 2001, Engelbrecht & Harrington 2005, Johnson et al. 2005, van Wyk et al. 2007, 2008, Heath et al. 2009). However, Ferreira et al. (2010) treated some isolates of the C. fimbriata s. lat. complex from Brazil as representing a particular population of C. fimbriata s. str., rather than as discrete taxa.
Global surveys of the health of Eucalyptus species in plantations have yielded a large collection of isolates that can loosely be accommodated in the C. fimbriata s. lat. complex. The aim of this study was to characterise these isolates and to consider patterns in their distribution on Eucalyptus species worldwide.

Africa, Thailand, and Indonesia (Table 1). The isolates were obtained by directly transferring spore masses from the apices of ascomata produced on the wounded inner bark and wood to agar plates. When sporulating structures were absent, the wood samples were placed in moist chambers to enhance sporulation. Spore masses were transferred to 2 % Malt Extract Agar (MEA) in Petri dishes and incubated at room temperature. Additionally, the carrot baiting technique was used to obtain isolates (Moller & DeVay 1968). (2) cultures were sourced from the culture collection (CMW) of the Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute (FABI) at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. These isolates had previously been identified as representing the C. fimbriata s. lat. complex and were from diseased Eucalyptus trees in various parts of the world including Brazil, Uganda, Congo, and Uruguay (Table 1).
PCR and sequencing reactions
DNA was extracted from all isolates as described by van Wyk et al. (2006a). Three gene regions were selected for PCR amplification, including ITS1 and ITS2, including the 5.8S rDNA operon, part of the beta-tubulin (t-1) gene, and part of the Transcription Elongation Factor-1 alpha (TEF1-) gene region. The reactions and programme for amplification were as described by van Wyk et al. (2006b). The primers utilized were ITS1 and ITS4 (White et al. 1990), t1a and t1b (Glass & Donaldson 1995), and EF1F and EF1R (Jacobs et al. 2004).
Sequencing reactions were set up and run as described by van Wyk et al. (2006a). Sequences of the isolates from Eucalyptus were analysed with Chromas Lite 2.01 (http:// www.technelysium.com.au). These sequences as well as those for all species in the C. fimbriata s. lat. species complex (Table 1) were aligned using MAFFT (http://timpani.genome. ad.jp/%7emafft/server/) (Katoh et al. 2002). All sequences derived from this study have been deposited in GenBank (Table 1).
Combined gene tree for all described species in the C. fimbriata s. lat. complex
Representative isolates of all described species in the C. fimbriata s. lat. complex were included in this dataset, including those obtained for this study from CMW. The sequences of three gene regions (ITS, t-1 and TEF1-) were combined and a partition homogeneity test (PHT) was used to determine if the data from the three regions could be combined, using the software programme PAUP v. 4.0b10 (Swofford 2002). Settings in PAUP were as described in van Wyk et al. (2010a). Ceratocystis virescens was selected as the outgroup taxon.
MrModeltest2 (Nylander 2004) was used to determine the most appropriate model of nucleotide substitution for each of the three gene regions, respectively. These models were then included in the Bayesian analyses using MrBayes (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003). The Bayesian analyses were run as described in van Wyk et al. (2010a).
Combined and separate gene trees of unnamed Ceratocystis fimbriata s. lat. isolates obtained from Eucalyptus
This dataset consisted only of Ceratocystis fimbriata s. lat. isolates from Eucalyptus trees and that have not yet
46 

been described as separate species. A closely related and previously described species, C. colombiana, also obtained from Eucalyptus, was included as an outgroup. This was done to determine whether these isolates represent one group with no separate grouping or whether geographical grouping exists, as has been documented in C. fimbriata s. lat. (Engelbrecht & Harrington 2005, Ferreira et al. 2010). Models were obtained for each of the ITS, t-1 and TEF1- gene regions with the use of MrModeltest2 (Nylander 2004). Consistent with both the first datasets, these models were incorporated into MrBayes (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) in order to run Bayesian analyses.
Utilising the C. fimbriata s. lat. isolates from Eucalyptus trees obtained from the CMW culture collection, the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software (MEGA) 4 (Tamura et al. 2007) was used to determine the amount of variation for each gene region. The three gene regions were inspected to determine the number of fixed alleles between them. Allele trees were drawn using the software TCS (Clement et al. 2000) from the combined dataset for the Eucalyptus isolates, including the closely related species C. colombiana, known only from Eucalyptus.
Culture characteristics and morphology
Two isolates of Ceratocystis fimbriata s. lat. from Eucalyptus were selected from each country, other than Brazil, for which only one Eucalyptus isolate was available. These were used to describe morphological characteristics. Isolates were transferred to each of five 2 % Malt Extract Agar (MEA) plates and incubated in the dark. The isolates were incubated at 30 튏 for 7 d, after which the growth was assessed.
Microscopic examinations were made of isolates from Indonesia, Uruguay, Thailand, and South Africa. Isolates from other countries were excluded because the cultures did not produce ascomata. All taxonomically informative structures were measured from 10 d old cultures on 2 % MEA, mounted in lactic acid. Ten measurements were made for each of the two isolates from Indonesia, Uruguay, Thailand, and South Africa.
A preliminary study of isolates representing the larger collection of C. fimbriata s. lat. isolates from Eucalyptus, and nested together in the same phylogenetic clade, showed that they are morphologically very similar. Consequently, four isolates (CMW 9998, CMW 15054, CMW 10000 and CMW 11536) from Eucalyptus in South Africa were selected for more detailed study. These South African isolates were transferred to five 2 % MEA plates each and incubated at seven different temperatures. These temperatures included 4 튏 and six temperatures between 10 튏 and 35 튏 at 5 튏 intervals. Growth was assessed after 7 d of incubation in the dark. Colony colour was assessed for the same isolates used as in the growth studies, grown on 2 % MEA for seven to 10 d at room temperature (25 튏). The colour charts of Rayner (1970) were used for descriptions of colony colour.
Fifty measurements were made of all taxonomically informative characters for isolate CMW 11536 from Eucalyptus in South Africa. An additional ten measurements were made of these structures for isolates CMW 9998 and CMW 10000 and CMW 15054. The minimum, maximum, average and standard deviation (stdv) was calculated for the

Results
Isolates
Twenty-five isolates obtained from CMW that had been isolated from Eucalyptus trees were included in this study (Table 1). Fifteen of these originated from natural or artificially induced wounds on trees in three countries, South Africa, Thailand, and Indonesia. In addition, ten of the isolates were from trees that are believed to have been killed by the fungus. The latter isolates were from Brazil, Congo, Uganda, and Uruguay.
PCR and sequencing reactions
Results were obtained for three separate datasets. The first provided a broad phylogenetic placement (i.e. Latin American or North American, Asian, and African clade) of the C. fimbriata s. lat. isolates from Eucalyptus. A more focussed analysis determined whether these isolates could be linked to any of the previously described species in the C. fimbriata s. lat. complex that were obtained from Eucalyptus. Thereafter, the isolates from Eucalyptus apparently representing undescribed species were considered in combined as well as single gene trees generated from the sequence data for these isolates. This was to determine whether they could be grouped based on geographical origin.
Combined gene tree for all described species in the Ceratocystis fimbriata s. lat. complex
Amplicons for the three gene regions were on average 500 bp for the ITS and t-1 gene regions and 800 bp for the TEF1- region (Table 1). The PHT for the data set including all described species in the C. fimbriata s. lat. complex, had a low value (P=0.01), but could be combined (Cunningham 1997).
Of the 1 989 characters in this dataset, 1 102 were constant, 45 were parsimony uninformative while 842 were parsimony informative. One hundred and forty two most parsimonious trees were obtained, of which one was selected for presentation (Fig. 1). The tree topology was as follows: Tree length (TL) = 2054 steps, Consistency Index (CI) = 0.7, Retention Index (RI) = 0.9 and Rescaled Consistency (RC) =

0.6. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a clade specific for the isolates from Eucalyptus (Fig. 1). Isolates in this large clade had high bootstrap (88 %) and Bayesian (88 %) support and included some substructure (Fig. 1). The substructure in the large clade for the isolates from Eucalyptus was not strongly supported and these isolates were treated as reflecting a single group of genetically related, but not identical isolates. The closest phylogenetic relative of the isolates in the Eucalyptus clade was C. colombiana (van Wyk et al. 2010a).
The models obtained using MrModeltest2 were the HKY+I+G model for both the ITS and the TEF1- genes and the GTR+G model for the t-1 gene region. Including these models in the Bayesian analyses resulted in a burnin of 7000. These 7000 trees were discarded from the final analyses. The posterior probabilities obtained with the Bayesian analyses supported the bootstrap values obtained in PAUP (Fig. 1).
Combined and separate gene trees for undescribed Ceratocystis fimbriata s. lat. isolates from Eucalyptus
In the dataset for the combined gene regions, there were 1 765 characters of which 1 680 were constant, 31 were parsimony uninformative while 54 were parsimony informative. Twentyfour most parsimonious trees were obtained, one of which was selected for presentation (Fig. 2). The tree topology was as follows: TL = 107 steps, CI = 0.8, RI = 0.9 and RC = 0.7. One well-supported clade (100 % bootstrap, 100 % Bayesian) was observed with high variation. Three clades that were supported within this large clade were also observed (Fig. 2). The models obtained for this dataset were the HKY model for the ITS gene, the F81 model for the t-1 gene region and the HKY+I model for the TEF1- gene region. A burn-in of 1000 was obtained and these 1000 trees were discarded from the final analyses. The posterior probabilities obtained with the Bayesian analyses supported the bootstrap values obtained with PAUP (Fig. 2).
Three well-supported clades were observed; the first included Asian (Indonesia and Thailand) and South American (Brazil and Uruguay) isolates; the second clade included African (Republic of Congo and South Africa) isolates while the third clade included African (Uganda) and Asian (Thailand) isolates. The previously described species, C. colombiana, grouped apart from these three clades (Fig. 2).
Where the data were treated separately, the trees for the ITS, T and TEF1- gene regions had a different topology when compared with those for the combined gene regions

Fig. 2. A phylogenetic tree for the combined sequences of the ITS, t and EF1- gene regions, including only the undescribed C. fimbriata s. lat. isolates with Eucalyptus as their host. The closely related species, C. colombiana, is included as outgroup. Bootstrap support is indicated at the branch nodes while Bayesian support is indicated in brackets.

(Fig. 3). For the ITS gene tree, the same three clades emerged as in the combined dataset and included those for Asian and South American isolates, the African isolates and the African together with Asian isolates. However, only the African and Asian clade had strong support (97 %), the other two clades, African (63 %) and the Asian/ South American (55 %) clades had weak support (Fig. 3). In the case of the t-1 gene tree, there was no support and all branches collapsed (Fig. 3). For the TEF1- gene tree, there were two small clades encompassing the South African isolates that had high and medium support (85 % and 65 % respectively), while the rest of the isolates grouped in a single clade with strong (85 %) support (Fig. 3).
Where data for the C. fimbriata s. lat. isolates were analysed in MEGA, the results showed that in the ITS gene region, the C. fimbriata s. lat. isolates obtained from

Eucalyptus were separated from C. colombiana by an average of 23 nucleotide differences (Table 2). Where isolates from different countries were compared, there was also variation in the ITS with a maximum of 13 bp and average of 5 bp differences (Table 2).
Where isolates of C. fimbriata s. lat. from Eucalyptus were compared with C. colombiana in the t-1 gene region, there were only 3bp differences between them (Table 2). Within the clade representing the C. fimbriata s. lat. group from Eucalyptus, there was only one base pair difference observed in the South African group and no differences between isolates from different countries (Table 2).
For the TEF1- gene region, there were 21bp differences between the isolate from Brazil and C. colombiana and an average of 8 bp differences between C. colombiana and the other isolates from Eucalyptus. Only the single isolate from

Fig. 4. Allele networks obtained from the three combined gene regions (ITS, t and TEF1- for all isolates from Eucalyptus as well as C. colombiana. The species C. colombiana is represented as highly different to the Eucalyptus isolates due to the fact that it formed a separate allele tree. The C. fimbriata s.lat. isolates from Eucalyptus all formed one allele tree with high variation observed within the tree.

Brazil differed from the other isolates while no differences were observed between the isolates from the other countries. The allele networks drawn from the combined gene regions (ITS, t-1 and TEF1-) for the C. fimbriata s. lat. obtained from Eucalyptus revealed a single tree with high variation (Fig. 4). There was no obvious geographic structure with regards to the origin of the eucalypt isolates. The previously described species, C. colombiana, formed a separate allele tree (Fig. 4).
Culture characteristics and morphology
All isolates from Eucalyptus had a similar greenish olivaceous (33'''f) (Rayner 1970) colony colour. The cultures had a banana odour similar to that of many Ceratocystis species.
The cultures all grew optimally at 30 튏. No clear morphological differences could be observed between isolates from different countries (Table 3).
Isolate CMW 11536 from Eucalyptus in South Africa was chosen to represent the global collection of isolates obtained from Eucalyptus. Three additional isolates (CMW 9998, CMW 10000 and CMW 15054), also from South Africa, were chosen as additional specimens for description. Cultures of these isolates were grown on 2 % MEA, dried down and have been deposited with the National Collection of Fungi (PREM), Pretoria, South Africa. Living cultures are maintained in the

culture collection (CMW) of the Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute (FABI) at the University of Pretoria, South Africa and the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) in Utrecht, The Netherlands.
Where growth in culture was characterised based on the average colony diameter (from the five inoculated plates) for the four selected Eucalyptus isolates from South Africa, after 7 d, limited growth was observed at 4 캜 (8 mm), 10 캜 (7 mm), 15 캜 (19 mm) and 35 캜 (10 mm). Intermediate growth was observed after 7 d at 20 캜 (34 mm) and 25 캜 (35 mm), while the optimum temperature for growth in culture was 30 캜 at which isolates reached an average of 39 mm diam after 7 d.
Taxonomy
Isolates of the Ceratocystis from Eucalyptus, originating from many different countries, were phylogenetically distinct from all other Ceratocystis species residing in the C. fimbriata s. lat. clade. They also formed distinct phylogenetic groups based on geographic origin and might be found to represent distinct taxa in the future. For the present, those isolates from South Africa, which also had a morphology different to all described species from Eucalyptus (Table 4) are described as representing a novel taxon.

Discussion
Isolates of Ceratocystis fimbriata s. lat. collected from Eucalyptus in Brazil, Indonesia, Republic of Congo, South Africa, Thailand, Uganda, and Uruguay were shown to be phylogenetically related. These included isolates taken from wounds on trees and also those that were associated with trees dying as result of infection by the fungus. Although all isolates from Eucalyptus resided in a single large clade, there was a high degree of diversity among them. It is thus possible that they represent a number of different cryptic species that cannot be resolved. For the present, those isolates from South Africa are provided with the name C. eucalypticola here. Future studies should seek to include additional isolates from Eucalyptus as well as to include sequences for gene regions not considered in this study, and that might discriminate more clearly between species in the C. fimbriata s. lat. complex. Currently, the group is unified based on a specific host and relatively strong phylogenetic similarity. In this respect, it also provides the foundation for further studies including a suite of isolates that would be difficult to obtain.
The species of Ceratocystis most closely related to C. eucalypticola is C. colombiana. Ceratocystis colombiana is a pathogen of coffee trees (Marin et al. 2003) as well as numerous other hosts including indigenous crops in Colombia. Although the two species are phylogenetically related, they are ecologically distinct and are not likely to be confused.
Ceratocystis eucalypticola is one of a number of species in the C. fimbriata s. lat. complex to be described from Eucalyptus trees. Other species from this host include; C. atrox (van Wyk et al. 2007) and C. corymbiicola (Kamgan Nkuekam et al. 2012) from Australia, C. pirilliformis (Barnes et al. 2003b) from Australia and South Africa, C. neglecta (Rodas et al. 2007) from Colombia, C. fimbriatomima (van Wyk et al. 2008) from Venezuela, and C. zombamontana (Heath et al. 2009) from Malawi. All of these species from Eucalyptus can be distinguished from each other based on phylogenetic inference and they have some morphological features that can be used to recognise them.
Morphologically, the specimens of C. eucalypticola cited here resemble species in the C. fimbriata s. lat. complex. The fungus has the typical green colony colour, is relatively slow growing, and has a fruity banana odour. Ceratocystis eucalypticola can be distinguished from other species in the C. fimbriata s. lat. complex in that they occur on Eucalyptus and based on differences in size of some diagnostic characters for this group of fungi.
Ceratocystis eucalypticola includes isolates only from wounds on trees in South Africa in the absence of disease,

but is very closely related to isolates that originated from dying trees and that have been shown to be pathogenic (Laia et al. 1999; Roux et al. 2000, 2001, 2004). The species is also closely related to isolates that were collected from wounds on trees in countries other than South Africa where a Ceratocystis disease on Eucalyptus has not been seen. Eucalyptus death associated with C. eucalypticola has never been found in South Africa although trees dying of unknown causes are thought to have died due to infection by this fungus, which can be difficult to isolate. The fungus collected from wounds on trees has also been shown to be pathogenic in greenhouse inoculation trials (Roux et al. 2004, van Wyk et al. 2010b).
Isolates of C. eucalypticola from South Africa represent a clonal population (van Wyk et al. 2006b) and it was most likely introduced into the country. It is thus intriguing that Eucalyptus death associated with this fungus has not been seen. This might be due to planting stock susceptible to C. eucalypticola not having occurred in the country, or that conditions for infection were not suitable. Alternatively, it is possible that trees dying of unexplained causes might have been killed by C. eucalypticola, even though the fungus was not isolated from them. This is a question that is currently being pursued, particularly linked to unexplained Eucalyptus death in South Africa and where Ceratocystis cultures emerge from isolations.

THE INDIAN MEDICAL GAZETTE.

[August 1901,

Western India, belongs to the Natural Order Apocynaceae, the other important poisonous species belonging to this order being Thevetia Neriifolia (yellow oleander) and Cerbera Odollam. Holarrhena Antidysenterica (Kurchi), the bark of which is considered by Indian practitioners as a specific in chronic dysentery, also belongs to this Natural Order. It grows wild almost all over India, but is much cultivated in the gardens for the sake of its flowers, white and red, considered invaluable as an offering to the deity in the Tantric form of Hindu worship. The flowers are also offered to Shiva and other Hindu gods and goddesses.
Description.
It is an evergreen shrub yielding a milky juice ; the plant is so common that a detailed description of its botanical characters is scarcely needed for its identification. The plant usually yields white or red flowers, about 1| inches in diameter and sweet-scented, but a yellow variety has also been described by Honorary Surgeon E. A. Morris, Tranquever, who found it growing near Seringapatam in the Mysore Province I have not seen any specimen of the yellow-flowered plant in this part of India. A short description of the leaves and roots with sketches in natural colours is given
below:?
Leaves.
Linear lanceolate ; thickly coriaceous ; accuminate ; midrib stout ; nerves numerous, slender, horizontal ; petiole very short.
Root.
Crooked, branched, ending in fine rootlets; externally pale yellowish grey ; bark not very thick, soft, consisting of two layers, the outer one being pale yellowish-grey, the inner layer is of a greenish-yellow colour. The bark can be readily peeled off by t he fingernail exposing the white central woody portion. The bark possesses a slight bitter taste succeeded by a peculiar pricking sensation in the tongue attended with numbness which usually lasts for about half an hour. The sensation is similar to the one produced on the tongue by the ethereal extract obtained by Stass' process from the fruits of the yellow oleander. The Nerium root is distinguished from the yellow oleander root by the latter possessing a very thick, succulent rootbark having no inner greenish yellow layer. The rootbark of the yellow oleander, when scraped, yields a thick milky-white sticky fluid, absent in the Nerium root. When warmed with strong hydrochloric acid, the root-bark of the yellow oleander turns blue (Warden's test), but no such color is produced in the Nerium rootbark when similarly treated.
Microscopical characters of the root.
A transverse section of the root discloses woodcells
and vessels, abundantly traversed by medullary rays which consisted of single rows of thick-walled parenchymatous cells. Drops and patches of a yellow and orange-coloured thick exudation were found deposited here and there in the woody portion of the root The outer pale yellowish-grey layer of the root-bark consisted of several layers of flattened cork cells containing drops of a colourless fluid ; the inner greenishyellow layer consisted of parenchymatous tissue of narrow cells with patches of a yellowish colour and containing small dark-coloured nodular masses. There were numerous openings of vessels in the inner layer of the bark. The cambium layer consisted of a few rows of greyish thin-walled cells. Starch cells were found
scattered both in the wood and bark of the root.

Ill the specimens I examined, I could not detect any crystals of oxalate of lime described as being present by
Mr. H. G. Greenish in the Pharmaceutical Journal of April 23, 1881, page 873. The characteristic microscopical appearance of a transverse section of the root consists in the presence of numerous medullary rays in
the woody portion running from the centre to the circumference, in the presence of yellow and orangecoloured drops of thick fluid in the wood and yellowish patches in the inner layer of the bark, as well as in the arrangement of the cork cells in the outer layer of the bark. These characters are well seen in the subjoined drawing sketched by an artist-friend of mine from a specimen prepared and mounted by me.
Medicinal uses.
Yery few preparations of the Hindu Materia Medica contain Nerium as one of their ingredients. There is, I find on enquiry, only one preparation called the Mohabiseswara Rasa containing Nerium routs in small quantities and which is administered internally for the cure of leprosy. For external application, an oil prepared by boiling roots of Nerium O.lorum and Plumbago Rosea, seeds of Embelia Ribes and cow's urine in Sesamuni oil is recommended by Sanskrit writers as a oure for eczema and other skin diseases. The fresh juice of the young loaves is described as a useful application in ophthalmia attended with copious lachrymation. A paste made of Nerium roots with water is recommended by Chakradatta as a cure for chancrous ulceration on the penis.
We find it stated in the Pharmacographia Indica that the Mahomedan physicians describe it as a most powerful resolvent and attenuant, only to be used externals ; internally it acts as a poison upon men and aninjSis. A. decoction of the root is recommended to reduce
swellings, and an oil prepared from the root-bark is
recommended in skin diseases of a scaly nature and in leprosy.
Surgeon-Major C. W. Calthorpe states that a poultice of the leaves fried in oil is applied to wounds to kill maggots.
The root of the white .flowered Nerium has an Indian reputation as being one of the best antidotes for snake poison and there prevails a strong popular belief in the virtue of this root as a repellant of snakes. It is alleged that its presence in a room is sufficient to drive away snakes.
Toxicological Notes. The plant has from very remote times been known in India to possess poisonous properties. It is one of the
seven minor poisons of the Hindu Materia Medica, the other six being Opium, Abrus Precatorius seeds, Datura, Glorios i Supeiba roots, milky juice of Calotropis Gigantea and Euphorbia Netiifolia. One of the Sanskrit names of the plant is Aswamaraka or Destroyer of horses and " it would seem from this that the poisonous roots were used for destroying horses."
All parts of the plant are poisonous. Dr. Honigbsrger was of opinion that the wild hill plant was more poisonous than the cultivated variety, and he is supported in this opinion by M Latour and Prof. E Pelikan who found by careful analysis that the wild variety contained a larger quantity of the poisonous principle. In the hills and in Western and Southern India, the root is said to be commonly used by women for suicidal purposes. The use of the Nerium root for suicidal purposes is, however, not common in Bengal ; the fruits of the yellow oleander .-ire more largely used for this purpose. During the fifteen years ending 1888, fourteen cases of Nerium poisoning were referred to the Chemical Examiner, Bombay, and eleven to the Chemical Examiner, Madras ; only two cases were dealt with by the Chemical Examiner, Bengal, during the same period.
In Bengal, the root of Nerium Odorum is used chiefly for the purpose of causing criminal abortion, it being applied locally and given internally for this purpose.

Assistant-Surgeon Satya Saran Chakrabutt.y, Registrar, Medical College Hospital, for supplying me with the
notes of the case.
A man, aged 35 years, by profession a Palwan (wrestler), took a quantity of Nerium bark for the relief of cough. On admission, he was found unconscious, with small extremely feeble and slow pulse, 30 per minute ; respirations quick ; occasional convulsions ; putting out of the tongue, and inability to speak. Strychnine and ether were injected hypodermically. Pulse was better half an hour after the injection, 92 per minute ; respirations 52 per minute. 30 grains of zinc sulphate were introduced through a nasal tube, as the stomach pump could not be introduced by the mouth owing to violent convulsions, after which there was nausea but no actual vomiting. Two hours after admission, the patient was found perspiring, getting spasms all over his body, laboured respirations (44 per minute), pulse irregular and small (about 90 per minute), heartsounds irregular. About five hours after admission, 14 oz*. of urine were drawn off by a catheter. The urine was free from albumem. There was an irregular rise and fall in the pulse rate ranging between 35 and 60 per minute, and at times becoming intermittent, for several hours. About twelve hours after admission, the patient's condition grew worse, had difficulty of breathing, extremities cold, unconscious, getting spasms, pulse feeble and slow. Ether was hypodermically injected and hot bottles applied to the extremities. He continued in this condition for nearly six hours after which he recovered gradually, the puls^ rose to 80, and the respirations came down to 20. His consciousness returned. He was discharged cured on the 4th day
after admission.
(9) Accidental.?In November 1898, two cases of Nerium poisoning were treated in the Calcutta Police Hospital under Major J. B. Gibbons, i.m.s., and were reported in the April number of the Indian Medical Gazette, 1899, by Assistant-Surgeon Kali Mohan Sen who was in charge of the cases.
The cases were admitted into the hospital on the 24th November 1898, at about 10 A m. The liistory pointed to each having taken a cupful of a strong decoction of the Nerium root at about 7 a.m. for the cure of pain in the loins from which b-th of them had been suffering.
(A) Mahomedan male, aged about 50. Vomited several times before and after coming to tlie hospital ; vomited matter consisted of yellowish frothy fluid. At the time of admission he was quite conscious and able to speak and swallow ; complained of no pain in the stomach ; pulse small, soft, slow (about GO per minute) but regular ; respirations normal ; eyes congested; pupils unequal, the right one being con-
tracted.
Two hours after admission, drowsiness and twitchings of the muscles of the hands were noticed. An hour after, spasms were noticed, most marked in the upper extremities and faco but slight in the legs. There was no lockjaw but dysphagia wan a marked symptom, and the patient was unable to speak, although he appeared to understand when spoken to and frequently smiled vacantly. Respirations were hurried, and the pulse slow and small, about 50 per minute.
Four hours after admission, he began to get tonic convulsions of all the muscles of the body, especially of the upper extremities ; no lockjaw. An hour after t.lie whole body was found rigid, and there were lockjaw, twitchings of the fingers and bending of the neck towards the right ; froth coming out from the mouth. The pulse was frequent (about 100 per minute), and the respirations hurried (about 70 per minute).
About 12 hours after admission, the upper extremities were found still rigid, but the lower extremities were flaccid ; breathing was hurried and stertorous, and the pulse was frequent and small.

Rigidity of the muscles began to disappear gradually, but the general condition of the patient became worse. The pulse began to fail, the breathing continued stertorous, and the conjunctival reflex was lost. The patient died about 26 hours after the ingestion of the poison.
Post-mortem appearances.?Dr. Gibbons held a postmortem examination on the body about four hours after death and recorded the following conditions:
"Rigor mortis well marked; body still warm to the touch. Right pupil a little smaller than the left. Thumbs resting against fingers. Lungs, adherent behind and very congested witli fluid blood. Heart, right side full witli blood, lift side nearly empty; spots of subendocardial hemorrhage on front wall and towards apex on both walls. Liver, spleen, and kidneys congested. Stomach contents, about 1| oz. of greenish-yellow fluid and much mucus, no smell ; stomach in folds with tops congested, mucous membrane congested, specially along the lesser curvature. Small intestine contents, yellow mucus, slight congestion of upper part of duodenum and a few scattered spots of congestion. Large intestine healthy, contained liquid fieces. Brain healthy. Trachea congested, and frothy liquid in the bronchi.
(B) Mahomedan male, about 28 years of age. The symptoms in this case were similar to those in the first case, excepting that they were apparently of a comparatively mild nature : there were vomiting, slow and feeble pulse, hurried respirations, twitchings of the muscles of the upper exireinities, which, however, developed about twelve hours after the ingestion of the poison as against five hours in the first case ; unequal dilatation of the pupils; bending of the head towards the right; general tonic convulsions of the whole body, opisthotonos ; lockjaw. A movement of the head from side to side was noticed, a- d th?'re was a slight rise of temperature on the second day of poisoning. Under treatment he began to improve steadily, but remained in a debilitated condition for about three weeks, after which he was discharged from the hospital qured.
The treatment in both the cases consisted in giving emetics and alcoholic and diffusible stimulants, mustard plaste: s over the heart and hypodermic injections of sulphuric ether.
The viscera of the deceased and the vomited matter of both the persons were sent to the Chemical Examiner, Bengal, for analysis. A narcotico-irritant principle was detected both in the viscera and in the vomited ma' ter which produced vomiting, weakness of the heart, general uneasiness and drowsiness in a cat, but not twitchings or convulsions. The poisonous principle could not be identified.
Remarks.?From the study of the above-mentioned cases and from the action of the poison on cats ('vide Chemical Notes), the symptoms and the post-mortem appearances one may expect to find in a case of Nerium poisoning, may be generalised as follows :
A. Symptoms.?Vomiting ; general uneasiness and restlessness ; frothy salivation; slow and feeble condition of the pulse ; hurried respirations, sometimes stertorous; twitchings of the muscles of the extremities, specially marked in the upper ones and more developed 011 one side than 011 the other ; rigidity of the voluntary muscles; tetanic spasms of the whole body, sometimes opisthotonos; frequently lockjaw; drowsiness passing into insensibility ; collapse. Diarrhoea usually absent.
B. Post mortem appearances.?Patches of congestion in the stomach and upper portion of the small intestine; congestion of the liver, lungs and kidneys ; engorgement of the general venous system ; both sides of the
heart full of blood.

anailemin in tropical macrocytic ANAEMIA
To the Editor, The Indian Medical Gazette Sir,?In a paper entitled ' Anahaemin in Tropical Macrocytic Anaemia' published in your July issue of this year, Napier and others refer to my review of the work of Dr. Lucy Wills and her co-workers (1937) which showed that in the nutritional macrocytic anaemias of monkeys the more highly purified liver extracts might be less efficacious than the less purified ones. The quotation ends as follows in inverted comas, ' In the reviewer's experience no clinical evidence of this danger is at present available ' It is unfortunate that the rest of the quotation was not given in the paper and that it was not made plain that my remarks referred to Addisonian pernicious anaemia and not to tropical macrocytic anaemia. The insertion of the remaining lines of my review in the 1938 Medical Annual makes this plain, for it continues?'Since, the improvement in the blood and central nervous system changes of his patients with pernicious anaemia has been as great and as quickly and easily produced with the recent highly purified preparation anahaemin as with the less purified preparation campolon'. This is the opinion also of Murphy of Boston who uses the highly purified extract made by the Lederle Company in 1 c.c. doses, and by Ungley of Newcastle and other leading haematologists in this country. This statement does not deny the possibility that the less highly

710

purified preparations might he more efficacious in tropical macrocytic anaemia.
Dr. Napier is working on a very valuable problem in trying to separate the large group of tropical macrocytic anaemias info smaller divisions by means of the therapeutic test. The difficulties are obviously great as judged by the variable and inconsistent responses which are reported in the different cases. It is difficult to compare different liver extracts with one another unless they are both used 011 a single case because of the variable response which individuals show to treatment. Another difficulty lies in reckoning what should be considered comparable doses of the different liver extracts to be tested; for instance, in case 8 conclusions are drawn in regard to the increased activity of campolon compared to anahaemin when the patient received only 2 c.c.'s of anahaemin as compared to 20 c.c.'s of campolon. Probably the same criticism is applicable to case 9, but unfortunately the number of days on which 4 c.c.'s of campolon was given is not stated.
Lastly, I would draw attention to the fact that batches of anahaemin were placed on the market last year which were of low potency. Some of our cases of pernicious anaemia showed little or no response to 2 to 4 c.c.'s of anahaemin. I understand that the potency of anahaemin at present on the market is extremely high. If therefore Dr. Napier and his colleagues had been so unfortunate as to use a batch of anahaemin of
poor quality, this would be another factor in making it difficult to assess the comparative value of different liver extracts in the treatment of tropical macrocytic anaemia.

[We are very pleased to get this opportunity to apologize for what we now see to have been an unjust criticism of Professor Davidson's review of Dr. Lucy Wills' work. The apology is not on account of the incompleteness of the quotation in question; in this matter we had no intention of misleading the reader. The paper Professor Davidson was reviewing was mainly concerned with experiments in nutritional anaemia of monkeys and the arguments in this paper were mostly applied to tropical macrocytic anaemia by analogy, but what we had overlooked was that Dr. Wills and her collaborators had specifically suggested that there might be some cases of pernicious anaemia 1 which would either not respond to anahsemin or make a poor temporary response, but would respond to the cruder preparations such as campolon'. This of course makes Professor Davidson's remarks both relevant and
necessary.
Another point he raises is in connection with the different dosages. We ourselves drew attention to this weakness in our conclusions. However, other workers have shown that very much smaller doses than we gave, as low as 25 milligrammes, will produce a reticulocyte response in pernicious anaemia. We did not give more than 200 mgm. because at that time our supply of anahaemin was very limited. In case 9 to which he refers, he is correct in assuming that a large total dose of campolon was given (this is clearly shown in the chart which is drawn to scale), but the early reticulocyte response indicated that it was the first or possibly the first two injections that produced this effect.
The last point that he raised was gone into very carefully by myself personally in London when I visited the laboratories* of the manufacturers. Our supplies were obtained directly from the agents in India and there seems little chance that any of the samples were of low potency. Further, our findings have been confirmed subsequently by Drs. Wills and Evans.

The manufacturers have generously given me further larger supply of anahtnmin to continue this work. This has enabled us to give larger doses with the result that in a number of cases we have obtained a sharp response, comparable to that hitherto obtained with campolon, though we have also confirmed our previous observations regarding its failure in certain other cases, even when large doses are given.

Abstract. Background: End of life symptoms and symptom management as well as the quality of dying (QoD) of persons with advanced dementia (PWAD) have not yet been systematically studied in Germany. Objective: 1) To investigate symptoms, treatment and care at the end of life, advance care planning, and circumstances of death of recently deceased PWAD; 2) To determine whether there are differences between young and late onset dementia (YOD and LOD). Methods: The study was performed in the context of the project EPYLOGE (IssuEs in Palliative care for persons in advanced and terminal stages of Young-onset and Late-Onset dementia in Germany). Closest relatives of recently deceased patients with advanced YOD (N = 46) and LOD (N = 54) living at home or in long term care were interviewed. Results: Circumstances of death, symptoms, and treatment appeared to be similar between YOD and LOD, except that persons with LOD had significantly more somatic comorbidities and were admitted to hospital in the last three months of life more often than persons with LOD. At end of life, 60% of PWAD appeared to be "at peace". Difficulty swallowing, gurgling, shortness of breath, and discomfort were observed most frequently. Large interindividual differences in suffering and QoD were present. Determinants of QoD were not identified. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that low QoD was caused by inadequate recognition and/or insufficient treatment of burdensome physical and emotional symptoms. PWADs' needs should be assessed regularly, and strategies focusing on treatment and implementing support for both the patient and caregiver must be established.

C. Romeier et al. / How Do Persons with Young and Late Onset Dementia Die?

INTRODUCTION
In the last decade, end of life in dementia and palliative care has moved into the focus of various dementia and palliative care research groups. Large studies (e.g., the Dutch End-of-Life in Dementia (DEOLD) study [1] or the Implementation of Quality Indicators in Palliative Care Study) [2] have provided valuable information on the symptoms of persons with advanced dementia (PWAD) at the end of life, their care and treatment, the quality of life and death, the patients' needs, the circumstances of death, and the specific issues and requirements of family carers and nursing staff (e.g., [3-7]). Optimal palliative care in older people with dementia has been defined by van der Steen and colleagues in their white paper [8].
Despite the wealth of studies on end of life in dementia, research on particular subgroups of PWAD is scarce. For example, the topic of end of life in young onset dementia (YOD) with symptom onset before the age of 65 has been almost neglected thus far. Although these patients have been included in large study cohorts of PWAD, small sample sizes prevented subgroup analyses from being performed (e.g., [9]). Thus, symptoms and symptom management at the end of life as well as the quality of dying (QoD) in YOD have not yet been examined. A variety of differences between YOD and late onset dementia (LOD) in early disease stages have been described with regard to symptoms and therapy [10-13]. Some differences have been described for advanced disease stages: persons with YOD have less somatic comorbidities, are more mobile and have more behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia than persons with LOD [14, 15]. Accordingly, the primary aim of our study was to find out if symptoms, treatment, and care at end of life also differ between YOD and LOD. Secondly, we aimed to investigate the circumstances of death in a large sample of recently deceased PWAD. In particular, we aimed to find out, how PWAD with very low and very good QoD were treated before death.
METHODS
Subjects
This project was performed in the context of the study EPYLOGE (IssuEs in Palliative care for people in advanced and terminal stages of Young-onset and Late-Onset dementia in Germany). The study design of EPYLOGE (ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03364179))

is described in [16]. Advanced dementia was defined as Clinical Dementia Rating [17] global score 2 or 3. EPYLOGE consisted of two parts: In "part A" a prospective study of palliative care issues in 181 PWAD was conducted, the findings have been reported recently [15]. In "part B", which is reported here, a postmortem interview was carried out with the closest relatives of PWAD who had died within the three-year study period of "part A" of EPYLOGE (N = 52) and with relatives of recently deceased PWAD (N = 48) who had additionally been identified through a large Bavarian dementia network (e.g., Munich Alzheimer Society, Alzheimer Society Germany, various long-term care facilities in Bavaria, clinical centers of the German Consortium for Frontotemporal Dementias).
Stratification was implemented, aiming to include relatives of approximately 50% persons with YOD and 50% with LOD. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine of the Technical University of Munich (No. 281/17 S).
Assessments
A neurologist with palliative care expertise (JH and CR) performed standardized interviews with closest relatives of the recently (within the preceding three months) deceased PWAD. Furthermore, all available medical and care records were studied. For the 52 PWAD who had been examined in the prospective "Part A" of the EPYLOGE-study, data about dementia etiology (according to the respective diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body disease, vascular dementia, and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease), and somatic comorbidities (according to ICD- 10 chapter II-IV and VI-XIV [18]) was available from EPYLOGE "part A". For the remaining 48 patients, the data was retrieved from medical records, the relatives, and the collaborators who had referred the relative of the deceased PWAD to the EPYLOGE study team.
The following data were collected from PWADs' records and the interviews with the relatives: demographic data; formal level of care as assessed by the German Health Insurance Medical Service; hospitalizations during the last three months of life, medical interventions during the last three months of life (permanent bladder catheter, suprapubic catheter, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), gastric tube, temporary custodial measures, cardiovascular resuscitation); non-drug treatments during the last three months of life (physiotherapy, occupational therapy,

Symptoms and suffering at end of life, and quality of dying were retrospectively assessed by interviews of the closest relatives using the End-ofLife in Dementia Scale: Symptom Management (EOLD-SM) [19], the End-of-Life in Dementia Scale: Comfort Assessment in Dying with Dementia (EOLD-CAD) [19], and the Mini-Suffering-StateExamination (MSSE) [20]. These assessment instruments have been shown to be valid and reliable and are recommended for the use in populations with dementia [21]. They are described in detail in Table 1.
Statistical methods
SPSS Statistics 25.0 for Windows (Armonk, New York, USA) was used for analyses.
Continuous data were compared between the two groups using either Student's t-tests or the MannWhitney U test, depending on the distribution of variables. Categorical variables were compared by 2 tests or Fisher exact tests. An exploratory approach without Bonferroni corrections for multiple testing was chosen. A linear regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of QoD. The total score of the EOLD-CAD was chosen as the dependent

variable. "Age at death", "gender", "place of living" (home care versus long term care (LTC)), "etiology of dementia" (Alzheimer's disease (AD) versus frontotemporal dementia) and "place of death" (hospital versus non-hospital) were selected as independent variables based on existing evidence on (e.g. [22]), and clinical experience about determinants of quality of life and dying in dementia. The assumptions of linear regression were confirmed.
RESULTS
One hundred family caregivers of deceased persons with advanced YOD (46%) and LOD (54%) were recruited.
Demographics of the PWAD, details of the etiology of dementia, place of living, and caregiver specifics are shown in Table 2. There were considerable differences between YOD and LOD with regard to gender, marital status, the family caregiver, and dementia etiology.
Somatic comorbidities were assessed for the last three months of life. Cardiovascular diseases (YOD 18.5%, LOD 67.4%), pulmonary diseases (YOD 24.1%, LOD 39.1%), and neurological diseases (YOD 25.9%, LOD 45.7%) were most frequent. Significantly more persons with LOD than YOD suffered from cardiovascular diseases (p = 0.001), and musculoskeletal diseases (p = 0.003).

Treatment and care in the last three months of life, circumstances of death as well as the availability of advance care documents are summarized in Table 3.
More hospital admissions were reported for LOD (45.3%) than for YOD (30.4%). This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.03). Apart from that, however, no other significant differences were identified between YOD and LOD with regard to nondrug treatment, medical interventions, psychotropic drug therapy, availability of advance care documents, place, and cause of death. During the last three months before death 22% of PWAD (YOD 14%,

LOD 8%; p = 0.060) received non-drug treatment. Twelve percent received physiotherapy, 10% occupational therapy, 6% speech/ swallowing therapy, and 1% music therapy. In the last days before death 8% of PWAD received oral care, and 3% aromatherapy. In the last three months of life, 9% of PWAD had a permanent bladder catheter, 1% a suprapubic catheter, 4% had a PEG, and 1% a gastric tube. Six percent of PWAD required temporary custodial measures, mainly to reduce the risk of falls (abdominal bandage, belt on the chair, attachment table, backpack belt, bed rails), in order to prevent manipulation of the bladder catheter or PEG (mittens, two-point restraint), and

in one case due to physical aggression (five-point restraint). Because of the low numbers of PWAD who received medical interventions, differences between YOD and LOD were not analyzed.
The prevalence of treatment with psychotropic drugs, non-opioid pain medication, opioids, and morphine on the day of death did not differ between YOD and LOD. 27% of PWAD received either morphine (19%), or an opioid other than morphine (20%) or a combination of opioids (12%).
Documents were searched to find out which advance care documents were available. A power of attorney was available in the vast majority of PWAD. Around 70% of PWAD had a living will. In 17% of the cases a proxy had written advance directives.
Medical and care instructions (crisis plan, therapy goals, "no rescue order") were available in 21 to 45% of PWAD. There were no differences between YOD and LOD.
The place of death did not differ significantly between YOD and LOD (p = 0.445). 56% of PWAD died in an LTC facility, while 26% died at home. Sixteen percent of PWAD died in a hospital (somatic unit 10%, intensive care unit 1%, palliative care unit 3%, psychiatric unit 2%) and 2% in a hospice. Causes of death were unknown in 31% of cases since we were not able to get the death certificates of the deceased PWAD. In the remaining PWAD causes of death, according to the death certificates, were: pneumonia 28%, cardiovascular disease 20%, sepsis 4%, cachexia 4%, other 44%. Causes of death did not differ between YOD and LOD (p = 0.737).
End of life symptoms were measured with the EOLD-SM scale for the last 90 days of life. The mean EOLD-SM total score was 32.91  8.432 (minimum: 11; maximum: 45) and did not differ between YOD and LOD (p = 0.950). According to the EOLD-SM, somatic symptoms, i.e., skin breakdown (43%), pain (every day/2 to 3 days a week: 31%), and shortness of breath (every day/2 to 3 days a week: 30%), were most frequent during the last 90 days of life, followed by depression (every day/2 to 3 days a week: 25%), and resistiveness to care (every day/2 to 3 days a week: 23%). Conversely, agitation, lack of calmness, fear, and anxiety were least frequent (every day/2 to 3 days a week: < 18%).
Suffering was measured with the MSSE. The mean MSSE score was 3.49  1.676 (minimum: 0; maximum: 8) and did not differ between YOD and LOD (p = 0.229). Nonetheless, levels of suffering differed substantially between individuals. While the majority of PWAD (76.9%) had low levels of suffering (MSSE

total score 0 - 3), 19.3% had intermediate levels (score 4 - 6), and 3.8% had high levels (score 7).
Quality of dying was measured in 94 PWAD with the EOLD-CAD (for the scoring of the EOALSCAD, see Table 1). Six PWAD died a sudden death and were not observed during dying and/ or did not have an obvious dying phase. For these cases the EOLD-CAD was not obtained. The EOLDCAD mean score was 34.59  4.687 (minimum: 24; maximum: 42). During the last week before death, difficulty swallowing was observed most frequently (67% "a lot", 8% "somewhat"), followed by gurgling (24% "a lot", 26% "somewhat"), shortness of breath (20% "a lot", 29% "somewhat"), and discomfort (15% "a lot", 24% "somewhat"). 27% suffered "a lot" or "somewhat" from pain, whereas crying, fear, and choking were found to occur least frequently. Serenity, peace, and calmness were rated "a lot" in 51%, 60%, and 65% respectively. EOLD-CAD mean scores did not differ between YOD (34.98  3.795) and LOD (34.25  5.340; p = 0.447). Inter-individual differences in QoD were large with many PWAD having a very high and others a very low QoD.
Table 4 gives an overview of the 15 PWAD with very low (< 29 points) EOLD-CAD total scores. Table 4 shows demographics, dementia etiology, place of living and death, EOLD-CAD total score and subscores, psychotropic drug therapy and pain medication before death as well as non-drug treatment, medical interventions and (palliative) care utilization during the last three months of life. The majority (73%) of PWAD with the worst QoD were persons with LOD, and 73% were male. Forty-seven percent of PWAD with very low QOD had a diagnosis of AD, 40% FTD and 13% Lewy body disease. Sixty percent lived in LTC and 40% at home. Place of death was the place of living in all cases with one exception: one patient who had lived at home was admitted to a hospital prior to death. According to EOLDCAD subscores, QoD was particularly affected by difficulties swallowing, restlessness, and discomfort (marked in bold in Table 4). It appears that several PWAD did not receive sufficient drug therapy. Nondrug treatment was offered only to very few PWAD and was limited to oral care in three PWAD, physiotherapy in three and aroma therapy in one PWAD.
All 12 PWAD with very good QoD (EOLD-CAD total score  40) had lived in LTC prior to death. The majority (83%) were persons with LOD and AD (75%). 33% of the PWAD with the best QoD had been admitted to a hospital prior to death, and one was in a palliative care ward.

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, our postmortem study is the first to compare circumstances of death, end of life symptoms and treatment, as well as QoD between persons with advanced YOD and LOD.

Overall, we detected few differences between YOD and LOD in the three months prior to death. Unsurprisingly, somatic comorbidities were significantly more frequent in LOD. Accordingly, significantly more persons with LOD were admitted to a hospital in the last three months before death than those with YOD. End of life symptoms, suffering, and QoD were similar in YOD and LOD. YOD patients tended to receive more non-drug treatment than LOD, but this difference was not significant. Moreover, there were no differences with regard to the administration of psychotropic drugs, pain medication, and morphine prior to death. Lastly, the causes and locations

of death, and the prevalence of advance care documents and treatment orders additionally did not differ between groups. Despite the fact that traditional end of life and palliative care primarily serve elderly PWAD, the lack of major differences between YOD and LOD allows the assumption that the less common group of dying persons with advanced YOD is not disadvantaged.
With the large number of 100 deceased PWAD, our study was able to provide important insights into the circumstances of death, symptoms, treatment, and care at the end of life in Germany.
We found that the vast majority of PWAD living in LTC died in LTC. Obviously, LTC facilities aim to provide PWAD the opportunity to die in familiar surroundings. On the contrary, 38% of the PWAD who were cared for at home, were admitted to a hospital before death. This might reflect that several family caregivers were overwhelmed during the final stages and/or that the support at home became insufficient.
Although only 18% of PWAD died in a hospital, 38% of PWAD had been admitted to a hospital at least once during the three months prior to death. Correspondingly, albeit to a greater extent, a recent Bavarian study of 58 deceased PWAD found that 47% were admitted to a hospital in the 30 days before death [23]. The main indications for hospital admissions in our study were adjustment of psychotropic drugs and antibiotics. Since hospitalization can be a particular burden for PWAD, these treatments should preferably be provided on an outpatient basis whenever possible, i.e., through home visits by the PWADs' primary care providers.
Interindividual differences of QoD were large. Sixty percent of PWAD were "at peace", a result that is--although direct comparisons between studies

must be made with caution--very similar to the findings of a Dutch study that demonstrated that 56% of 233 deceased PWAD in LTC had died "peacefully" [24]. Nonetheless, several PWAD in the present study had a disturbingly low QoD.
In the group of 15 PWAD with the worst QoD, it appeared that the symptoms assessed with the EOLD-CAD were either not recognized, not treated effectively, or were unresponsive to treatment. Specific (palliative) non-drug treatment such as music, aroma, massage therapy, and oral care, recommended to prevent or relieve end of life suffering was severely lacking. However, this insufficiency of non-drug treatment was not just in those with the worst QoD but was evident cohort-wide. In actuality, very few PWAD in our study received non-drug treatment. In the 15 PWAD with the worst QoD, we further noticed that in some cases drug therapy was either not appropriate or was not sufficient enough to alleviate physical and emotional distress.
Twenty-seven percent of all PWAD in our study were prescribed opioids (morphine or non-morphine opioid) on the day of death. This is much lower than the 77% of 330 PWAD reported by the Dutch "DEOLD" study [25]. Considering that within the last seven days before death almost half of the PWAD in our study suffered from shortness of breath, and 27% from pain, we conclude that the palliative treatment administered was not sufficient for many PWAD.
It is undisputed that advance care planning has positive effects on care and treatment [26]. Vandervoort et al. [27] showed that patients with a written advance directive had lower emotional distress in the last week of life. In our study, 70% of PWAD had a living will. Such directives are extremely helpful when it comes to decision making at the end of life. Once the

C. Romeier et al. / How Do Persons with Young and Late Onset Dementia Die?

851

decision to stop life-prolonging therapies has been made, subsequent goals of care plans, contingency plans, and medical treatment orders provide certainty and clarity to the practitioner and the family while further preventing burdensome treatment. We were surprised about the rather low prevalence of these documents in our cohort. Medical and care providers as well as the families need to be better informed about the meaning and purpose of advance care documents, so that many more goals of care plans, contingency plans, and medical treatment orders are written for PWAD.
A linear regression analysis showed, that neither the age group (YOD or LOD), the place of living (at home or LTC), the etiology of dementia (AD or FTD), or the place of death (hospital or at home/ LTC) had an effect on QoD.
Thus, PWAD who died in a hospital did not have a lower QoD than those who died in their home environment. Interestingly, one third of the twelve PWAD who had the best QoD died in a hospital. In some cases, palliative medical treatment of physical and emotional symptoms requires close monitoring and regular adaptation of medication. This can often only be achieved in a hospital. Ideally, when recommended after careful individual consideration, patients should be admitted into dementia-friendly hospitals with palliative care experience, or, if necessary, into a palliative care ward.
It must be noted that this study was not without limitations. First, a selection bias occurred as a result of recruiting through a University Hospital memory clinic and a large Bavarian dementia network. The majority of the PWAD and their caregivers had already found their way into a system that provides education and counselling, possibly resulting in better care and treatment at the end of life. Another limitation was the use of retrospective reports of the relatives (medical laypersons) to investigate end of life symptoms and QoD. Although all interviews were performed within three months after the PWAD's death, a memory bias cannot be excluded. Furthermore, since it is often difficult for medical staff to correctly (differential-) diagnose particularly the emotional symptoms in PWAD, it is even more a challenge for medical laypersons. Finally, it is still not clear how to define a high QoD in PWAD. We assume that QoD is high when patients appear calm and relaxed, rather than agitated or in pain. Unfortunately, though, conclusions can only be made from observations and what PWAD really feel will remain unknown.

CONCLUSION
Undoubtedly there is a need for end-of-life palliative care for patients suffering from dementia. The PWADs' needs must be assessed regularly, and supportive treatment strategies should be adapted accordingly. It is important to identify PWAD who suffer from physical or emotional symptoms, and then alleviate those symptoms by establishing, monitoring, and adjusting effective drug and non-drug treatment. Additionally, providing counselling and support to family caregivers of PWAD who live and die at home is crucial. To do so, the incorporation of palliative care coordinators would be desirable. Likewise, it must be highlighted that a hospital admission before death does not necessarily result in a reduced QoD. Lastly, informing medical and care providers as well as patients' families about the meaning and purpose of advance care documents might increase the number of written therapy goals, contingency plans, and GP orders which will alleviate burdensome treatment and provide certainty and clarity to all involved.

Background---Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited primary arrhythmia disorder leading to sudden cardiac arrest. SCN5A, encoding the a-subunit of the cardiac sodium channel (Nav1.5), is the most common pathogenic gene of BrS. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is the standard treatment for secondary prevention. This study aimed to evaluate association of the SCN5A variant with this cardiac conduction disturbance and appropriate ICD shock therapy in Thai symptomatic BrS patients with ICD implants.
Methods and Results---Symptomatic BrS patients diagnosed at university hospital were enrolled from 2008 to 2011. The primary outcome of the study was an appropriate ICD shock defined as having non-pacing-associated ICD shock after the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Associations between SCN5A polymorphisms, cardiac conduction disturbance, and potential confounding factors associated with appropriate ICD shock therapy were analyzed. All 40 symptomatic BrS patients (median age, 43 years) with ICD implantations were followed for 24 months. There were 16 patients (40%) who had the appropriate ICD shock therapy after ICD treatment. An independent factor associated with appropriate ICD shock therapy was SCN5A-R1193Q with an adjusted hazard ratio of 10.550 (95% CI, 1.631-68.232).
Conclusions---SCN5A-R1193Q is associated with cardiac conduction disturbances. It may be a genetic marker associated with ventricular arrhythmia leading to appropriate ICD shock therapy in symptomatic BrS patients with ICD treatment. Because of the small sample size of study population and the appropriate ICD shock outcome, further large studies are needed to confirm the results of this study. ( J Am Heart Assoc. 2017;6:e005009.

leads V1 and/or V2 positioned in the second, third, or fourth intercostal spaces occurring either spontaneously or after provocative drug testing with intravenous administration of sodium-channel blockers.1,2 In Thailand, there were survivors from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) who were found to have an ECG profile and symptoms characteristic of BrS, and some of whom had a documented family history of SCA.3,4 Most patients were young, born and raised in the northeastern part of Thailand without any previous medical history. It is believed that BrS is an inherited disease attributed to genetic penetrance in family members. Currently, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is the standard treatment for secondary prevention post-SCA or syncope of unknown origin.5,6 The ICD is an effective treatment to prevent cardiac arrest from recurrent ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VF) in BrS patients.
The SCN5A gene mutations were found in 20% to 25% of BrS patients and 0% to 0.08% in general population.1 There are 4 known common polymorphisms of the SCN5A gene related to BrS, including R34C, H558R, S1103Y, and R1193Q.7,8 These SCN5A polymorphisms could decrease

Clinical Perspective
What is New?
 SCN5A-R1193Q is a genetic marker associated with cardiac conduction defects and ventricular fibrillation in symptomatic BrS patients.
What are the Clinical Implications?
 Cardiologists should be aware that BrS patients with the SCN5A-R1193Q polymorphism may require more careful monitoring of medications or electrolyte abnormalities to prevent ventricular arrhythmias.
expression of sodium-channel proteins and alter gating properties resulting in prolongation of the QRS duration and slow conduction in the heart.7,9 The SCN5A mutations may be associated with early and frequent VF recurrence or SCA in BrS patients, which may be related to fibrosis in the right ventricular outflow tract epicardial surface.10,11 Most studies on SCN5A mutations included both asymptomatic and symptomatic BrS patients.8-11 This study was aimed to investigate the association of SCN5A mutations and appropriate ICD shock therapy in only symptomatic BrS patients.
Methods
Study Population
All patients diagnosed with BrS in Queen Sirikit Heart Center of The Northeast and Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University, Thailand, between 2008 and 2011 were enrolled. The diagnosis of BrS was made clinically in patients presenting with SCA or unexplained syncope with 1 of the following criteria: evidence of documented ventricular tachycardia or VF; a family history of sudden cardiac death at <45 years of age; a similar type ECG in family members; history of nocturnal agonal respiration with spontaneous type 1 Brugada ECG; or showing type 1 Brugada ECG after provocation by using high intercostal ECG lead detection or after administration of flecainide. Type 1 ECG was defined as a prominent coved ST segment elevation >2 mm followed by a negative T wave.2
All patients received cardiac workups, including echocardiograms and coronary angiograms, to exclude structural heart diseases. All workups of structural heart disease were required to be normal. The study protocol was approved by an institutional review committee, Khon Kaen University, and conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided informed consent before study enrollment.
The following clinical data were captured and documented: age at diagnosis; sex; birthplace; family history of SCA; type of

Brugada ECG at diagnosis; results of pharmacological testing or high intercostal lead detection for unmasking the coved type ECG pattern; circumstances of diagnosis (survival of SCA, syncope); indication for ICD implantation; genetic study with SCN5A genotyping; and ICD follow-up data. High intercostal ECGs were obtained by placing the precordial V1 to V2 leads in the fourth intercostal space, V3 to V4 in the third intercostal space, and V5 to V6 in the second intercostal space. V1, V3, and V5 were placed on the right side, with V2, V4, and V6 on the left side. The diagnosis of BrS was made by evidence of coved-type ECG in at least 1 of the high intercostal leads.12
SCN5A Genotyping
Ten milliliters of peripheral venous blood were obtained from patients using standard blood sampling techniques. Genomic DNA of each patient was isolated from peripheral leukocytes. All 28 exons of SCN5A were determined by amplifying using specific primers.13 The polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and run on the automated ABI Prism Model 3100 Avant Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Outcomes
All patients were followed at the cardiac device clinic every 3 to 6 months. ICD data of each patient were collected and interpreted at each follow-up. All patients were categorized as BrS with or without recurrent appropriate ICD shock. Appropriate ICD shock is defined as having non-pacing-associated ICD shock after the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia or VF.14 Those patients who had inappropriate ICD shocks, such as sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or lead fractures, were excluded.
Statistical Analysis
The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for comparison of medians of continuous variables between BrS patients with or without appropriate shock. Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables between the 2 groups.
Univariate Cox regression analysis was applied to calculate the crude hazard ratios of individual variables for having appropriate ICD shocks over times. All variables with P<0.20 in univariate analysis or that were clinically significant were included in subsequent multivariate Cox regression analysis. Clinically significant factors were previously reported potential confounding factors associated with appropriate ICD shock, such as family history of SCA. The final model was composed of potential confounding factors associated with appropriate

ICD shock as follows: family history of cardiac arrest; PR interval; QRS duration; and SCN5A-R1193Q. Analytical results are presented as adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs. The significant factors were plotted for the ICD shock-free times and time to the first ICD shock by Kaplan-Meier analysis.
Results
During the study period, 40 patients met the study inclusion criteria and received single-chamber ICD treatment programed for a VF zone of >188 beats/min. The median (range) age of all patients was 43 years (22-66). The median (range) follow-up time was 24 months (13-52). There were 29 patients (72.5%) who had spontaneous Brugada ECG type 1; others (11 patients; 27.5%) were unmasked by high intercostal lead placement.
Of 28 exons of SCN5A genotyping, only H558R (Exon-12, c. 1673 A>G, rs1805124) and R1193Q (Exon 20, c.3578G>A, rs41261344) were identified in 9 (22.5%) and 6 (15.0%) patients, with allele frequencies of 0.113 and 0.075. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested to check whether the included individuals were in equilibrium for the frequencies of genotype. The genotypes of these 2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of SCN5A (H558R and R1193Q) followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which implies that the included individuals are likely to represent the population.
Among them, there were 16 patients (40%) who had the appropriate ICD shock therapy after ICD treatment; 10 of these patients with a history of SCA. The average time to first ICD shock was 8.504.43 months. Almost all patients were male (97.5%), and SCA was the most common indication for ICD treatment (72.5%). A significantly higher percentage of patients with SCN5A-R1193Q was observed in the group with appropriate ICD shock (31.25% versus 4.35%; P=0.029). However, the frequency of patients who carried SCN5AH558R was not significantly different between these 2 groups as shown in Table 1.
Of 40 eligible symptomatic BrS patients, 9 (22.5%) had SCN5A-H558R and/or R1193Q. Two (5%) BrS patients had both SCN5A-H558R and R1193Q, whereas 7 (18%) and 4 (10%) BrS patients had only SCN5A-H558R and R1193Q (Table 1). The association between the SCN5A polymorphisms and electrocardiographic findings are shown in Tables 2 through 4. SCN5A-R1193Q was associated with a longer PR interval (201 [196-212] versus 168 [162-176] ms; P=0.002) and a widening of the QRS duration (145 [140-155] versus 133 [128-142] ms; P=0.023) as shown in Table 3 and Figure 1.
Four potential confounding factors were included in the Cox proportional model to identify factors associated with appropriate ICD therapy, including family history of cardiac arrest, PR interval, QRS duration, and SCN5A-R1193Q as

Discussion
Only 2 known SCN5A polymorphisms were identified in these 40 symptomatic BrS patients--H558R and R1193Q in 9 (22.5%) and 6 (15.0%) patients, with allele frequencies of 0.113 and 0.075. As in a previous report, the global frequency of R1193Q (OMIM: 600163.0023) is 0.0124. R1193Q is mostly found in Asian, such as Chinese (0.05-0.08), Vietnamese (0.08), and Japanese (0.02), whereas it is defined as a mutation in other populations, such as white (0.00) and black (0.00). The frequency of R1193Q in this study is higher than that in the Thai general population (0.075 versus 0.0395), because only symptomatic BrS cases (majority with history of SCA) are included in the present study.15
Moreover, the R1193Q in the present study is associated with cardiac conduction delay with evidence of a longer PR, a wider QRS duration, and a significantly higher frequency of R1193Q was observed in the BrS patients receiving appropriate ICD shock therapy more than those who did not receive the ICD shock therapy (31.25% versus 4.35%; P=0.029), as shown in Table 1. Ohkubo et al also reported prolonged QRS duration of more than 120 ms, as measured on a standard ECG, that is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia in BrS.9 These findings occur because of abnormal slow and fragmented epicardial electrograms from reduction in gap junction expression at right ventricular outflow tract evidenced by autopsies.11 These abnormal electrograms caused by cardiac conduction delay may lead to generate reentry of ventricular arrhythmia, as shown in this study, by appropriate ICD therapy in BrS patients (Table 1). This study also confirms the importance of QRS duration as a risk of ventricular arrhythmia.

Previous reports also showed that R1193Q polymorphism could accelerate the inactivation of the sodium-channel current, leading to a cardiac conduction defect and endocardial and epicardial repolarization abnormalities resulting in arrhythmogenesis.16-18 The PR prolongation could differentiate between SCN5A and non-SCN5A BrS patients.19,20 The study herein also showed longer PR intervals in BrS patients with either R1193Q or H558R SCN5A polymorphisms (Tables 2 through 4).
This study shows that the rate of appropriate ICD therapy was 34.5% in the aborted SCA group. These rates were comparable with a previous study, which reported discharge rates for appropriate ICD therapy of 44% in the aborted SCA group during a 7-year follow-up period.21 Forty symptomatic BrS patients receiving ICD treatment were examined in this study. R1193Q was the only factor that may be associated with appropriate ICD shock therapy after ICD treatment by both univariate and multivariate Cox regression for survival analysis (Table 5). This finding may be explained by the genetic heterogeneous character of BrS in different ethnicities. R1193Q was associated with cardiac conduction delays that may modulate arrhythmogenic substrates, leading to ventricular arrhythmia and recurrent appropriate ICD therapy.22
R1193Q, a G to A mutation at position 3578, which causes the substitution of arginine for glutamine at position 1193, appeared to be a genetic factor associated with appropriate ICD shock therapy in symptomatic BrS patients with the ICD treatment. Therefore, cardiologists should carefully follow up with an awareness of recurrent ventricular tachycardia and VF in symptomatic BrS patients who have this polymorphism by avoiding modulating factors, such as psychotropic drugs, fever, class I antiarrhythmic drugs, and electrolyte abnormalities.23
H558R, an A to G mutation at position 1673, which causes the substitution of histidine for arginine at position 558, may be associated with sodium-channel inactivation, but not as strong as R1193Q.24 The results of this study supported this hypothesis, evidenced by the prolongation of PR interval, but not significant QRS widening, in BrS patients with the presence of H558R (Table 4). And, H558R was not associated with appropriate ICD shocks in symptomatic BrS patients (Table 1).
The family history of SCA has been proposed as 1 risk predictor in the past.4 Recent evidence, however, has clearly demonstrated that family history has not been a reliable marker for high risk in patients affected by BrS.2 Moreover, the value of a family history of sudden death in BrS patients has been extensively investigated, and results in that family history of SCA are not predictive for future arrhythmic events.25,26 Consistent with these studies, present results have also shown that family history of SCA was not

BrS is an uncommon genetic disease resulting in a small sample size. Presence of R1193Q polymorphism are categorical data. Because of small study populations and categorical data, the CI of R1193Q polymorphism is large. This study is in a relatively isolated population because most of the patients were originally from northeastern Thailand, and the findings may not be inferred for other populations. Another limitation of this study is that only 2 polymorphisms of SCN5A were identified in this study. If the BrS patients have other mutations in addition to R1193Q, risks for ventricular arrhythmias may be higher.

Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier survival curve of symptomatic Brugada Syndrome patients treated with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) showed probabilities of ICD shock free and time to the first ICD shock categorized by presence of R1193Q polymorphism. Further large studies are needed to confirm the results of this study. But, the strength and uniqueness of this study is that patients enrolled in the study were all symptomatic BrS patients and mostly with documented SCA. In this study, the diagnosis of BrS was made clinically. We retrospectively traced back all patients in this study with the 2016 diagnostic criteria for BrS.27 All patients met with the definite criteria for BrS by the median Shanghai score of 6.5 (range, 4.0-7.5).
In conclusion, SCN5A-R1193Q polymorphism is associated with a cardiac conduction disturbance and may be a genetic factor associated with ventricular arrhythmia, leading to appropriate ICD shock therapy in symptomatic BrS patients with ICD treatment. This study is needed to be confirmed in other ethnicities and with a larger sample size in the future.

Volume Overload and Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease: Clinical Observational and Animal Studies
Szu-Chun Hung, MD; Yi-Shin Lai, MS; Ko-Lin Kuo, MD, PhD; Der-Cherng Tarng, MD, PhD
Background---Volume overload is frequently encountered and is associated with cardiovascular risk factors in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the relationship between volume overload and adverse outcomes in CKD is not fully understood.
Methods and Results---A prospective cohort of 338 patients with stage 3 to 5 CKD was followed for a median of 2.1 years. The study participants were stratified by the presence or absence of volume overload, defined as an overhydration index assessed by bioimpedance spectroscopy exceeding 7%, the 90th percentile for the healthy population. The primary outcome was the composite of estimated glomerular filtration rate decline 50% or end-stage renal disease. The secondary outcome included a composite of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular causes. Animal models were used to simulate fluid retention observed in human CKD. We found that patients with volume overload were at a higher risk of the primary and secondary end points in the adjusted Cox models. Furthermore, overhydration appears to be more important than hypertension in predicting an elevated risk. In rats subjected to unilateral nephrectomy and a high-salt diet, the extracellular water significantly increased. This fluid retention was associated with an increase in blood pressure, proteinuria, renal inflammation with macrophage infiltration and tumor necrosis factor-a overexpression, glomerular sclerosis, and cardiac fibrosis. Diuretic treatment with indapamide attenuated these changes, suggesting that fluid retention might play a role in the development of adverse outcomes.
Conclusions---Volume overload contributes to CKD progression and cardiovascular diseases. Further research is warranted to clarify whether the correction of volume overload would improve outcomes for CKD patients. ( J Am Heart Assoc. 2015;4: e001918 doi: 10.1161/JAHA.115.001918)

C hronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly recognized as a public health problem worldwide.1 CKD substantially increases the risks of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is associated with considerable healthcare costs.2 There is convincing evidence that the development of ESRD and CVD could be delayed by a multidisciplinary approach that controls modifiable risk factors.3,4 We previously demonstrated that volume overload

is common in CKD patients and is associated with anemia, hypertension, proteinuria, arterial stiffness, and inflammation,5,6 which are strong predictors of CKD progression and CVD events. Consequently, volume overload shows great promise as a potential modifiable risk factor.
Volume overload has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis and in patients with acute kidney injury.7,8 However, the available evidence detailing the effects of volume overload in CKD patients does not use a valid technique for measuring the level of fluid status, and the values obtained cannot be compared directly with the values in the normal population. Few studies have been conducted to evaluate the association of volume overload with adverse outcomes in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD,9 and even fewer have been conducted by using animal models.
We hypothesized that volume overload might contribute significantly to the development of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD. In the present study, we examined the association between volume overload and renal and cardiovascular outcomes in 338 adult patients with stage 3 to 5 CKD by using the Body Composition Monitor

(BCM, Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany), a novel bioimpedance spectroscopy device, to measure the volume status. Furthermore, we examined the effect of highsalt-induced fluid retention on renal and cardiac damage in uninephrectomized rats. This animal model closely simulates the volume overload observed in human CKD and provides opportunities to investigate causality and disease-specific mechanisms.
Materials and Methods
Patients and Laboratory Measurements
The study design and population were previously described.6 Briefly, 338 patients with stage 3 to 5 CKD who were referred to the nephrology clinic at Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Taiwan between September 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012, were enrolled in the study and were followed until June 30, 2014. In all of the patients, a thorough medical history was taken and the medical chart was reviewed at the time of study enrollment. Diabetes mellitus was assumed to be present in patients who reported the current or past use of insulin and/or oral antidiabetic agents. Hypertension was defined on the basis of a blood pressure (BP) 140/90 mm Hg or current therapy for hypertension. The presence of CVD was defined as a medical history and clinical findings of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, as documented by coronary angiography or a history of myocardial infarction, and/or cerebrovascular disease. The primary outcome was the first occurrence of a decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 50% or ESRD needing chronic dialysis. The secondary outcome, morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular causes, was a composite of the first occurrence of myocardial infarction, hospitalization for congestive heart failure or unstable angina, or death from cardiovascular causes. Changes in the eGFR were confirmed at least 4 weeks after the treatment of potentially reversible factors. The timing of the initiation of chronic dialysis was determined according to the regulations of the National Health Insurance Administration of Taiwan. CVD deaths included fatal myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, and sudden death. The patients were followed every 3 months. For the primary outcome, patients were censored at the time of their last outpatient visit, death, or end of follow-up period, whereas for the secondary outcome, patients were censored at the time of their last outpatient visit, noncardiovascular death, or end of follow-up period. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all of the participants, and our study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki.

BP was measured by use of an automated oscillometric sphygmomanometry (Welch Allyn, Series 300). All of the study personnel were trained to use the device, to select an appropriately sized arm cuff, and to start the measurements after 10 minutes of rest with the subject having voided and being seated quietly in a straight-back chair with the arm at heart level. The plasma levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) (R&D Systems), and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (Roche Diagnostics) were measured by using commercially available ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. The serum albumin level was determined by using a bromocresol purple (BCP) assay. Proteinuria was expressed as the ratio of urine protein to creatinine (UPCR) determined by using the first morning void.
Measurement of Human Volume Status
The fluid status was assessed by using the BCM and was represented by the level of overhydration (OH). The BCM measures the electrical responses at 50 different frequencies from 5 to 1000 kHz. OH is derived from the impedance data based on a unique 3-compartment model of OH, lean tissue mass, and adipose tissue mass.10 OH is the difference between the amount of extracellular water (ECW) in tissue that is detected by the BCM and the amount of ECW in tissue that is predicted by using physiological models under normal (euvolemic) conditions. Therefore, the OH value obtained from the BCM can be compared directly with the value for the normal population. Volume overload was defined as a relative OH value (OH normalized to ECW or OH/ECW) 7%, which corresponds to the value of the 90th percentile for the healthy population.11 The same reference range of OH has been validated in Taiwanese individuals.6 The investigators and participants were blinded to the OH results.
Animals and Laboratory Measurements
Because the clinical observations do not represent causality, animal models are used to simulate and elucidate the volume overload observed in human CKD. Three-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=40) were randomly assigned to receive a sham operation or uninephrectomy (anesthetized with pentobarbital 50 mg/kg IP) and were then subjected to either a normal-salt (0.4%) or high-salt (8.0%) diet from 4 to 8 weeks of age. The salt-loaded uninephrectomized rats were treated with indapamide (IDP, 3 mg/kg per day orally) to investigate the role of volume overload in exacerbating cardiac and renal injury in CKD. Five different experimental groups were created: shamoperated rats raised with a normal- (Sham+NS) or high-salt diet (Sham+HS), uninephrectomized rats raised with a normal(UNX+NS) or high-salt diet (UNX+HS), and IDP-treated UNX+HS rats (UNX+HS+IDP). All of the rats were housed in a room

maintained at 21 to 23캜 with a 12-hour light/dark cycle and were provided food and water ad libitum. All of the rats were placed in metabolic cages for 24 hours, and food and water consumption, urine volume, and urine sodium, protein, and creatinine levels were measured at baseline and after 4 weeks of different salt intake. At the end of the experiment, the rats were killed by decapitation, and the serum, kidneys, and hearts were collected. The kidney and heart samples were fixed in 10% formalin solution and then embedded in paraffin for histological analysis. The harvested kidney and heart tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80캜 for protein isolation. All of the animal studies were performed under a protocol approved by the ethics committees on animal research of the Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University.
Systolic BP (SBP) was measured by using the tail-cuff method (NIBP-06, Singa Technology Corporation). Conscious rats were put in restrainers for habituation 10 to 15 minutes prior to readings being taken. The serum levels of TNF-a (R&D Systems) were measured by using commercially available ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. Frozen renal samples were homogenized (1 mL/0.1 g kidney tissues) and sonicated with homogenizing buffer. The homogenate was then centrifuged to remove tissue debris. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at 20캜. An ELISA was performed to assess TNF-a (BD Biosciences). Proteinuria was expressed as UPCR. For the morphological evaluations, paraffinized kidney sections (3-lm thickness) were stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reagents (Sigma-Aldrich) and analyzed semiquantitatively for the severity of glomerulosclerosis as described previously. Glomerulosclerosis was graded on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 indicating normal, 1 indicating 1% to 25% of glomeruli with sclerotic lesions, 2 indicating 26% to 50% of glomeruli with sclerotic lesions, 3 indicating 51% to 75%, and 4 indicating >75% of sclerotic glomeruli. In a similar manner, cardiac fibrosis was scored for all conditions on Masson trichrome-stained (Sigma-Aldrich) sections. The blue region of the section represented collagen-enriched areas, and the cellular elements stained red. High-power fields (magnification 9400) were selected randomly and digitalized by using a video camera; software (Image-Pro PLUS version 6.0) was subsequently used to compute the percentage of the blue-stained region in the total area. ED1 (AbD Serotec) immunostaining was used as a marker of rat macrophages in renal tissues. The infiltration of macrophages was assessed by counting the ED-1-positive cells in 10 to 15 randomly selected cortical fields (magnification 9400).
Measurement of Animal Volume Status
The ImpediVet (ImpediMed) analyzes whole-body bioimpedance data to determine the total body water (TBW) and ECW. The ECW/TBW was then taken as a measure of volume status.
DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.115.001918

Briefly, the rats were anesthetized and measured for length and weight. The animal was placed in the prone position and shaved to allow adequate skin contact at the sites of needle placement. Four needles (25 gauge 9 25 mm) bent at 90, 5 mm from the tip, were inserted under the skin at the base of the tail, at the intercept between the front of the ears and the longitudinal midline and at 2 cm from these sites toward the tip of the tail and the nose. The measurements were initiated after the leads were attached to the needles. Volume status was measured at baseline and at the end of the experiment.
Statistical Analysis
All of the variables were expressed as the frequencies and percentages for categorical data and as the meanSD values or medians and interquartile ranges for continuous data with or without a normal distribution, respectively. Differences between 2 groups were compared by using the v2 test for categorical variables and unpaired t test or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. Differences among >2 groups were compared by using v2 statistics, 1-way or 2-way ANOVA followed by appropriate post-hoc tests, or Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate. Cumulative survival curves for the composite outcome were generated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) with unadjusted, minimally adjusted (for age and sex), and multivariable adjusted models (for age, sex, CVD, diabetes mellitus, SBP, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, eGFR, and UPCR cut at 0.5, which is the border between microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria). Because the event rate was relatively low, we avoided overfitting the model by selecting 8 covariates for multivariable adjustments.12 Furthermore, we did not adjust for related covariates such as NT-proBNP or serum albumin due to their strong correlation with fluid retention. The proportional hazard assumption, which was the constant HR over time, was assessed by comparing the estimated log-log survival curves for all of the time-independent covariates. All of the assessed log-log survival plots graphically showed 2 parallel lines, indicating no violation of the assumption. A 2-tailed P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The analyses were performed by using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc).

Volume Overload and CKD Outcomes Hung et al
Table 1. During a median follow up of 2.1 years, 78 patients in the volume-overload group (44.6%) reached the primary end point, compared with 22 in the euvolemia group (13.5%). In addition, 71 patients (21%) progressed to ESRD needing chronic dialysis. The decline in eGFR in patients with volume overload was significantly faster than those without volume overload (eGFR slope: 4.3 [12.6, 1.2] versus 1.7 [7.8, 2.7] mL/min per 1.73 m2 per year, respectively; P<0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a significantly higher CKD progression or ESRD in the patients with volume overload (P<0.001 by the log-rank test). In the multivariable regression analysis (Table 2), the patients with volume overload had greater than double the risk of the composite end point (adjusted HR 2.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45 to 4.13; P=0.001). To further elucidate the contribution of elevated OH levels, we performed multivariable Cox analyses with OH as a continuous variable. These analyses confirmed an increased risk of the composite end point (adjusted HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.42; P<0.001) for every 1-L increase in OH.

Secondary outcome
Volume overload had a similar predictive effect in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Table 2). Forty-seven patients reached the secondary end point (40 in the volume-overload group [22.9%] and 7 in the euvolemia group [4.3%]). Thirteen patients died of cardiovascular causes (11 in the volumeoverload group [6.3%] and 2 in the euvolemia group [1.2%]). The rate of first hospitalization for congestive heart failure was significantly higher in the volume-overload group (24 patients [13.7%] compared with 2 in the euvolemia group [1.2%]). There was also a significant difference between the number of coronary events in the volume-overload group (13 patients [7.4%] compared with 5 in the euvolemia group [3.1%]).
Overhydration, hypertension, and outcomes
The patients were further classified according to the baseline SBP (categories: <140 or 140 mm Hg) and OH (categories: <7 or 7%) to investigate if volume overload had a higher

predictive value of an increased risk for the composite outcome than hypertension. The following 4 groups could be identified: patients who are normohydrated and normotensive (32%), patients who are hypertensive despite being normohydrated (17%, non-volume-dependent hypertension); patients who are normotensive despite being volume overloaded (22%); and patients who are both volume overloaded and hypertensive (29%, volume-dependent hypertension) (Table 3, Figure 1). Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed a significant association between volume overload and the primary or secondary outcome (P<0.001 by the log-rank test) (Figure 2). By multivariable regression analysis, the risk of primary or secondary outcome in patients with volumedependent hypertension was significantly greater compared with patients who are normohydrated and normotensive. In contrast, the HR was not statistically significant for patients with non-volume-dependent hypertension compared with patients who are normohydrated and normotensive (Table 4).
Animals
Fluid retention, hypertension, and proteinuria
At baseline, there were no significant difference among the 5 groups. At 4 weeks, water intake, urine output, and urine sodium excretion were significantly higher in the rats receiving a high-salt diet (Figure 3A through 3C). Consistent with our expectations, the UNX+HS rats had a significantly higher ratio of ECW/TBW, and SBP and more proteinuria than the control rats (Sham+NS, Sham+HS, and UNX+NS), suggesting that animal models of CKD are particularly salt sensitive. Diuretic treatment with IDP (UNX+HS+IDP) significantly reduced ECW/TBW, SBP, and proteinuria in the UNX+HS rats (Figure 3D through 3F). What was more intriguing is that the changes in proteinuria were not

significantly correlated with SBP changes. The results of the animal study at 4 weeks are shown in Table 5.
Systemic and renal inflammation At 4 weeks, the serum and renal levels of TNF-a were higher in the UNX+HS rats than in the control rats (Sham+NS, Sham+HS, and UNX+NS). Diuretic treatment with IDP blunted the increase of the inflammatory mediator (Figure 4A and 4B). The UNX+HS rats also had a marked increase in renal macrophage infiltrations compared with the control rats (Sham+NS, Sham+HS, and UNX+NS). This increase was prevented with IDP (Figure 5A and 5B).
Renal glomerular sclerosis and cardiac interstitial fibrosis Glomerular sclerosis was increased in the UNX+HS rats compared with the control rats (Sham+NS, Sham+HS, and UNX+NS) at 4 weeks and was reduced by diuretic treatment with IDP (Figure 5C and 5D). Cardiac interstitial fibrosis was also increased in the UNX+HS rats compared with the control rats (Sham+NS, Sham+HS, and UNX+NS) at 4 weeks and was improved with IDP (Figure 5E and 5F).
Discussion
In our prospective cohort of patients with stage 3 to 5 CKD, we determined that volume overload was independently correlated with renal and cardiovascular outcomes. In addition, the patients with volume-dependent hypertension had a substantially higher risk of adverse outcomes than did the patients with non-volume-dependent hypertension. Fluid retention appears to be more important than hypertension and has a higher predictive value of an elevated risk. We also demonstrated that a reduction in renal mass by unilateral

nephrectomy and a high-salt intake in rats caused increased ECW volume, hypertension, and renal and cardiac injury, including proteinuria, glomerular sclerosis together with renal macrophage infiltrations, and cardiac interstitial fibrosis. Diuretic treatment with IDP decreased fluid retention and BP, which, in turn, led to a decrease in renal and cardiac injury. The results of our study suggest that natriuresis could play an important role in the prevention of CKD and CVD and highlight the need for an optimal strategy for volume management in CKD patients in clinical practice.
Patients with CKD frequently are salt sensitive. The potential consequences of high dietary salt intake, including fluid retention and higher BP, are more common in the context of CKD. When subjected to volume overload, the left ventricular chamber dilates and remodels in an eccentric manner. In contrast, concentric remodeling is considered an early stage of cardiac adaptation to increased workload.13 Left ventricular hypertrophy is an important risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD.14,15 Eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with a poorer prognosis than concentric hypertrophy,16 indicating that volume overload might be of particular relevance in the
DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.115.001918

pathogenesis of CVD in these patients. Furthermore, elevated right and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure due to fluid retention ultimately lead to increased renal venous pressure.17 Hemodynamically, an increase in the renal venous pressure results in decreased renal perfusion, which initiates a vicious circle by causing sodium retention, the expansion of plasma volume, and a further worsening of renal function.18
Until recently, it was thought that the effect of salt on renal and cardiovascular outcomes is driven primarily through changes in BP. However, the results of our study showed that CKD patients with volume overload had an increased risk of adverse renal or cardiovascular outcomes independently of the presence or absence of hypertension. The risk was not significantly different between hypertensives and nonhypertensives without volume overload. In addition, our study determined that in CKD rats receiving a high-salt diet, proteinuria was substantially increased. However, the changes in proteinuria were independent of SBP changes, suggesting that the harmful renal effects of dietary sodium might beyond the effects of elevated systemic BP. Vogt et al also determined that changes in proteinuria with sodium restriction were independent of the BP-lowering effect,

suggesting that the relationship between sodium intake and proteinuria might have been driven in part by changes in the glomerular structure or function.19
Vegter et al conducted a post hoc analysis of the first and second Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy trials to evaluate the association of sodium intake with proteinuria and progression to ESRD among 500 CKD patients without diabetes receiving ramipril therapy.20 In their study, they showed that high dietary salt appears to blunt the antiproteinuric effect of the ACE inhibitor and to increase the risk of ESRD but is independent of BP control. In a recent study enrolling a prospective cohort of 328 CKD patients on maintenance hemodialysis, we demonstrated that the inverse association of aldosterone with CVD events is due to the confounding effect of volume overload.21 Our findings are in agreement with previous evidence and suggest that treatment with reninangiotensin system blockers might lead to improved CVD outcomes only in those CKD patients who have achieved strict volume control. In the first double-blind randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of salt restriction on BP and proteinuria in hypertensive patients with CKD stage 3 or 4, McMahon et al determined that sodium restriction reduced extracellular volume, BP, and proteinuria without significant adverse effects over a short 2-week intervention.22 These

The patients were classified into 4 groups according to the baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP; <140 or 140 mm Hg) and overhydration (OH; <7 or 7%). The patients with volume overload demonstrated a substantially increased risk compared with those without volume overload.
findings suggest that patients with CKD might be particularly susceptible to the detrimental effects of salt-induced fluid retention and provide evidence to support salt restriction and volume control in CKD.
The detrimental effects of excess salt intake might occur via fluid retention, hypertension, and nonvolume, nonpressure pathways. Recent research indicates that other mediators, such as endothelial activation and proinflammatory cytokines, might play a more pronounced role than previously thought. Despite interaction, salt toxicity could act independently through different pathophysiological mechanisms on the target organ. Circumferential stretch of venous endothelial cells from venous congestion induces proinflammatory endothelial activation.23 In the present study, patients or animals with volume overload had significantly higher proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 or TNF-a compared with the patients or animals without volume overload. Accumulating evidence has shown that inflammation affcts myocardial and renal function and contributes to both the development of CVD and the progression of CKD.

Excess sodium might have direct toxic effects on blood
vessels through mediating factors such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial cell dysfunction.24 Dietary salt, by facilitating the glomerular and cardiac expression of transforming growth factor b, might directly promote the development of glomerulosclerosis and cardiac interstitial fibrosis.25 Additionally, 2 recent studies demonstrated that increased sodium concentrations dramatically boost the

induction of murine and human Th17 cells in vitro.26 High salt conditions activate the p38/MAPK pathway that involves the serum glucocorticoid kinase 1 during cytokine-induced Th17 polarization. Pathogenic Th17 cells are highly proinflammatory cells that have been shown to mediate human and experimental renal diseases.27 Th17 effector cells directly induce renal inflammation by activating neutrophils or by participating in macrophage-mediated tissue injury.

increased dietary salt intake might represent an environmental risk factor for the development of CKD through the induction of pathogenic Th17 cells.
Study Limitations
A strength of this study is its combined use of a prospective cohort study and animal study. However, certain limitations of the study should be acknowledged. As is the case for any observational study, we were unable to establish the causality of the relationship between volume overload and outcomes. Although the results of the animal study supported the hypothesis that salt-induced volume overload could result in renal and cardiovascular damage, it was difficult to untangle the complex relationship between salt and volume. It is unclear whether the relationship involved salt toxicity or adverse effects from fluid retention. Another limitation was the lack of data regarding the dietary salt and fluid intake in CKD patients. As shown in Table 1, 113 (33.4%) of study participants were receiving diuretic treatment. Twenty-fourhour urinary sodium excretion is a good proxy for salt intake in the steady state, but it can be falsely elevated in patients taking a diuretic. Furthermore, patients on diuretic therapy might have different levels of hydration status during the course of the day, and there is a room for misinterpretation of hydration status in such patients. Finally, the overall CVD event rate was low in the present study, as reflected by a relatively wide CI in the secondary end point. Although CKD patients in Western countries frequently die of CVD before developing ESRD, CKD patients in Taiwan are more likely to develop ESRD than to have a cardiovascular event.28 The limited number of CVD events also limits the ability to adjust for other potentially important covariates of interest.
Conclusions
Volume overload exhibits a strong association with CKD progression and CVD morbidity or mortality in patients with stage 3 to 5 CKD. In animal models of CKD, salt-induced fluid retention results in renal and cardiovascular damage, which is ameliorated by diuretics. Therefore, our findings suggest that volume overload is an important mechanism contributing to the adverse outcomes observed in CKD and requires appropriate management. Further research is warranted to clarify whether the correction of volume overload should be one of the main targets to achieve better outcomes in patients with CKD.

Distinct Functions For Integrins t 3/ l in Focal Adhesions and t 6/ 4/Bullous Pemphigoid Antigen in a New Stable Anchoring Contact (SAC) of Keratinocytes: Relation to Hemidesmosomes
William G. Carter, Pritinder Kaur, Susana G. Gil, Pamala J. Gahr, and Elizabeth A. Wayner Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the Department of Pathobiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98104

Abstract. Basal cells of stratified epidermis are anchored to the basement membrane zone (BMZ) of skin via hemidesmosomes. We previously identified integrin tx3B1, in focal adhesions (FAs), of cultured human keratinocytes (HFKs) as a mediator of HFK adhesion to secreted BMZ-like extracellular matrix (ECM; Carter, W. G., E. A. Wayner, T. S. Bouchard, and P. Kaur. 1990. J. Cell Biol. 110: 1387-1404). Here, we have examined the relation o f integrins ct6/~4 and tx3B1, to bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPA), a component of hemidesmosomes. We conclude that ot6B4 in HFKs localizes in a new stable anchoring contact (SAC) that cooperates with tx3B1-FAs to mediate adhesion to ECM, based on the following. (a) Comparison of secreted ECM, with exogenous laminin, fibronectin and collagen identified ECM as the preferred ligand for HFK adhesion and spreading and for formation of both tx6B4-SACs and ~x3B1-FAs. (b) Inhibition of HFK adhesion with combined anti-or3/31 (P1B5) and anti-c~6B4 (GoH3) antibodies indicated that

both receptors were functional in adhesion to ECM while oe3B1 played a dominant role in spreading. (c) tx6fl4 colocalized with BPA in SACs that were proximal to but excluded from FAs. Both tx6~4-SACs and ot3fll-FAs were in contact with the adhesion surface as indicated by antibody exclusion and interference reflection microscopy. (d) In contrast to ot3~l-FAs, ot6~4SACs were present only in nonmotile cells, not associated with stress fibers, and were relatively stable to detergents and urea, suggesting a nonmotile, or anchoring function for SACs and motility functions for tx3B1-FAs. (e) ct6B4 formed a detergent-insoluble complex with exogenous ECM in an affinity isolation procedure, confirming the ability of an unidentified ECM ligand to interact with ot6f14. (f) We suggest that ot6B4/BPA-SACs in culture restrict migration of HFKs on ECM while tx3fll-FAs form dynamic adhesions in spreading and migrating cells, a6fl4/BPA-SACs in culture bear functional and compositional similarities to hemidesmosomes in skin.

ASALcell of the human epidermis may adhere to the basement membrane zone (BMZ)1 through hemidesmosomes (Staehelin, 1974). Hemidesmosomes are identifiable by electron microscopy as electron dense plaques localized to the cytoplasmic side of the basal membrane of keratinocytes attached to the BMZ (Selby, 1955; Odland, 1958; Shienvold and Kelly, 1976). Although little is known about the composition of hemidesmosomes, they are distinct from demosomes (Jones et al., 1986), and are sites for keratin filament insertion at the basal membrane (Staehelin, 1974; Jones et al., 1989). Krawczyk and Wilgram (1973) and Gipson et al. (1983) suggested that sites for insertion of anchoring fibrils into the

BMZ may be nucleation points for new hemidesmosomes. Anchoring fibrils of the BMZ contain type VII collagen (Sakai et al., 1986; Keene et al., 1987; Smith and Sybert, 1990). Additional components of the BMZ include laminin, entactin/nidogen, heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and type IV as well as type VII collagens synthesized by the basal cells (Katz, 1984; Martin and Timpl, 1987; Yurchenco and Schittny, 1990; Beck et al., 1990). Laminin and type IV collagen are structural and adhesive components localized to the lamina rara and lamina densa of the BMZ, respectively.
A correlation between the ultrastructure of hemidesmosomes and possible hemidesmosome function in basal cell adhesion to the BMZ is suggested from investigations of the autoimmune disorder, bullous pemphigoid (for review see Stanley, 1983, 1989). Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by detachment of epidermis from the BMZ. These patients also produce polyclonal autoantibodies against a 230-kD protein and a distinct 180-kD protein component of the hemidesmosome plaque. The circulating autoantibodies

against these bullous pemphigoid antigens (BPAs) are not known to be causal in the disease. BPAs in keratinocytes from epidermis and cultured cells are incorporated in two pools: one insoluble and associated with the basal cell cytoskeleton (Mutasim et al., 1985, 1989) and the other soluble in isotonic buffers (Stanley et al., 1981). It has been reported that hemidesmosomes are endocytosed after trypsinization (Takahashi et al., 1985). It is not known whether these endocytosed BPAs are degraded or reused in formation of"hemidesmosome-like structures" in culture. The 230-kD BPA has been localized to the cytoplasmic plaque of hemidesmosomes (Westgate et al., 1985; Tanaka et al., 1990; Ikeda et al., 1990). The implications are that BPAs in hemidesmosomes may contribute to a physiologically significant adhesion structure in skin.
In contrast to basal cell attachment in skin, cultured cells adhere to the substrate via multiple types of adhesion structures including focal adhesions or focal contacts (FAs; Burridge et al., 1988) that contain integrin adhesion receptors (Hynes, 1987; Buck and Horwitz, 1987; Carteret al., 1990; Chen and Singer, 1982; Ruoslahti, 1988). FAs are the closest contacts of the cells with the extracellular adhesive ligands (Burridge et al., 1988) and can be identified by interference reflection microscopy (Singer et al., 1988) or antibody exclusion techniques (Neyfakh et al., 1983). The integrin 131 subunits in FAs are the origins of actin containing stress fibers (Burridge et al., 1988). This complex of stress fibers, integrin and ligand play a major role in dynamic processes including adhesion, spreading, and migration (Straus et al., 1989; Bretscher, 1989; Zieske et al., 1989).
Adhesion of cultured neonatal foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) to exogenous ligands, fibronectin, collagen, and secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) localizes ot5B1, ol2B1, and ot3B1, to the FAs, respectively (Carter et al., 1990). An uncharacterized component(s) of secreted ECM was the preferred ligand for localization of ot3B1 in FAs when compared to exogenous laminin, collagen, and fibronectin (Carter et al., 1990). In addition to the/31 integrins, HFKs and other squamous epithelium also express integrin cx6B4 (or cxEB4; Kajiji, et al., 1989; Hemler et al., 1989; Carter et al., 1990), a proposed laminin receptor (Cheresh et al., 1989; Lotz et al., 1990).
Both FAs and hemidesmosomes are suggested as physiologically significant structures in epithelial cell adhesion to the BMZ (Griepp and Robbins, 1988). We have examined the distribution, function and interactions of BPA, integrins ot3/51, and ot6/~4in cell culture as components of FAs and a new anchoring adhesion (SAC). The relation of SACs in culture to hemidesmosomes in skin is discussed.
Materials and Methods
Materials
PMSF, N-ethylmaleimide, 2-mercaptoethanol, BSA, Triton X-100, protein A-Agarose, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Dimethyldichlorosilane was from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, IL). Peroxidase- and fluorescein-conjugeted goat anti-monse and anti-rat IgG and lgM (H and L chains) or peroxidase and rhodamine-conjugatedgoat anti-rabbitIgG and IgM (H and L chains) were obtained from Tago, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). [51Cr]sodium chromate was from New England Nuclear (Boston, MA). Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR).

Cells and Cell Culture
Normal newborn HFKs were prepared as described by Boyce and Ham (1985) and maintained in serum free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM; Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA) containing insulin, epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), hydrocortisone, and bovine pituitary extract (,o50 tzg protein/ml).
Preparation of ExtraceUular Matrix Adhesion Ligands
Mouse laminin (derived from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) sarcoma, grown in mice) was purchased from Collaborative Research, Inc. (Bedford, MA) or prepared in this lab. The EHS sarcoma laminin migrated as two bands of "o200 and 400 kD on SDS-PAGE and that reacted with antllaminin antibodies by immunoblotting. No other bands reacted with antifibronectin or anti-type IV collagen antibodies or stained with Coomassie blue. Plasma fibronectin and collagen types I, and IV, were prepared as described (Wayner et al., 1988).
Antibodies
mAbs to the integrin receptors cx3B1 (PIB5, P1F2), c~2/51(P1H5), c~5B1 (P1D6), and 81 (P4C10) have been described (Wayner and Carter, 1987; Wayner et al., 1988, 1989; Carter et al., 1990). P1H5 and P1D6 inhibit fibroblast, keratinocyte, and platelet adhesion to collagen and fibronectincoated substrates, respectively (V~tyner et al., 1987; Wayner et al., 1988, Carter et al., 1990). mAb P4C10 reacts with all/~l-contalningintegrins and inhibits cell adhesion to laminin, collagen, and fibronectin (Carter et al., 1990). SP2 is a control conditioned culture medium from the SP2 mouse melanoma. Monoclonal anti-c~6(GoH3) was from Dr. Arnoud Sonnenberg (Central Lab. of Netherlands Red Cross, Amsterdam, Holland) and has been reported to inhibit platelet adhesion to laminin via 쥅6~1 and carcinoma adhesion to laminin via c~6B4(Lotz et al., 1990). Rabbit anti-mouse EHS sarcoma laminin (R5922) was prepared as previously described (Wayner and Carter, 1987). Mouse mAb 3El against integrin #4 was a gift from Dr. Eva Engvall (La Jolla Cancer Research Center, La Jolla, CA). Mouse mAb K8.13 anti-cytokeratin (Gigi et al., 1982) was from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Rabbitpolyelonal antiserum against the carboxy terminus of the BPA (R1086) was prepared as described (Tanaka et al., 1990) and localizes to hemidesmosome on the cytoplasmic side of the basal membrane of keratinoeytes in skin.
Adhesion of Cells to Coverslips
Acid-washed glass coverslips (25 mm diana) were derivatized with dimethyldichlorosilane, then coaled with purified ligands (5-20 t~gprotein/ml) then blocked with 1% (wt/vol) heat-denatured bovine serum albumin (HD-BSA) in PBS as previously described (Carter et al., 1990). Cells were suspended and adhered to the coverslips in KGM medium for periods of 1 h to 3 d (Carter et al., 1990).
Keratinocyte Extracellular Matrix
For this study, the extracellular matrix synthesized and secreted by HFKs shall be referred to as ECM. Endogenous ECM is secreted during the time course of an assay. Exogenous ECM was purified from cultures of HFKs and used as a ligand for adhesion of other cells. Exogenous ECM was prepared by growing HFKs for 3 d in KGM on glass coverslips or 48-well virgin styrene plates coated with various ligands. The adherent cells were removed by sequential extractionwith (a) 1%(vul/vol) Triton X-100 detergent in PBS, (b) 2 M urea in 1 M NaCI, and (c) 8 M urea. All extractionbuffers contained 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride and 2 mM N-ethylmaieimide as protease inhibitors. The ECM was digested with 10/~g/ml DNase I for 30 min in 1% HD-BSA/PBS. The resulting coverslips were washed with PBS, blocked with HD-BSA, and used for cell adhesion studies.
lmmunofluorescence, Interference Reflection, and Antibody Exclusion Microscopy
Coverslips and cells prepared as described above were incubated with combinations of mouse or rat monoclonal antibodies and rabbit polyelonal primary antibodies diluted in 1% HD-BSA overnight as previously described (Carter et al., 1990). The slips were washed with PBS, incubated with dilutions of affinity-purified, species-specific, FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse/ rat IgG and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibod-

ies for 1 h, and washed with PBS. Interference reflection microscopy was performed basically as described (Izzard and Lochner, 1976) and was used to identify FAs in the same field as the two-color fluorescence. FAs were also localized by the antibody exclusion technique (Neyfakh et al., 1983).
Inhibition of CeU-Substrate Adhesion
Inhibition of cell adhesion to various ligands was performed as previously described (Wayner and Carter, 1987; Carter et al., 1990). The cells were labeled with Na251CrO4(50/~Ci/ml for 2-4 h) and were allowed to adhere to the protein-coated surfaces in the presence of the hybridoma superuatants for 1-2 h for short-term adhesion assays (Fig. 2 A and B or Fig. 3) or 18-24 h for long term adhesion assays (Fig. 4) at 37캜. Previous studies (Carter et al., 1990) have indicated that long-term adhesion results in secretion of endogenous ECM and localization of a 3/~1in FAs regardless of the exogenous ligand that was coated on the glass surface and used to initiate the adhesion. Over a 24-h period, the endogenous ECM is deposited even when HD-BSA is used as a ligand or blocking agent. Therefore, long-term adhesion to HD-BSA-coated surfaces is due to secretion of endogenous ECM.
Immune Precipitation, and PAGE
Adherent HFKs were metabolically labeled with [35S]methione (50 ~Ci/ml for 18 h) followed by sequential extraction with: (a) 1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 detergent in PBS, (b) 2 M urea in 1 M NaC1, (c) 8 M urea as described for preparation of ECM for adhesion studies; and (d) the adherent ECM was solubilized in 0.5% SDS with scraping with a rubber policeman. Each extraction buffer was added to the adherent cell layer, incubated for

15 rain then mmeved leaving the adherent cell residue. All extraction buffer contained I mM PMSF, and 2 mM N-ethylmaleimide as protease inhibitors. Immune precipitation was performed as previously described (Wayner and Carter, 1987). SDS-PAGE gels were prepared following the basic stacking gel system of Laemmli (1970).
Tissue Staining
The distribution of receptors and ligands in tissue were determined by immunoperoxidase microscopy of cryostat sections. Cryostat sections (6 ~tm) were prepared from human neonatal foreskin embedded in OCT medium after snap freezing in isopentane/liquid nitrogen. Where indicated (Fig. 1), sections were incubated in PBS with or without Triton X-100 detergent (1% (vol/vol) in PBS for 10min) before fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. This extraction was performed to identify solubility differences in tissue components. All sections were subsequently permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 after fixation then incubated with primary antibodies and peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies.

for additional non-/31receptor involvement in adhesion. Adhesions surfaces were
coated with fibronectin (FN), type I collagen (COL), laminin (/.,AM), or HFK ECM (ECM). 5tCr-labeled HFKs were incubated with the adhesion surface in the presence of inhibitory antibodies (PID6,PIHS,etc.) for 2 h, then washed to remove nonadherent ceils. The adherent cells were dissolved and

to larninin in the BMZ of neonatal foreskin (Fig. 1). Previous results have shown that or3 and or6 combine with/31 and/34, respectively, in cultures of primary HFKs (Carter et al., 1990). a3/31 was localized to the basal, lateral, and apical surfaces of the basal cells. In contrast; o~6/34concentrated in the basal region of the basal cells with small quantities of or6, but not/34, also detected in lateral and apical surfaces of these cells. BPA localized specifically to the dermal-epidermal junction near to laminin in the BMZ. This localization is consistent with the reported presence of BPA in the cytoplasmic plaque of hemidesmosomes Ohnaka et al., 1990). For comparison, keratin localized in all stratified layers of the epidermis but not the dermis.
We further distinguished ot3/31 from ot6/34 in skin. Detergent extraction of the cryostat sections before staining solubilized virtually all of the or3 and/31 subunits, with much less effect on the distribution of a6,/34, laminin, BPA or keratin (Fig. 1). The Triton X-100-insoluble or6,/34 and BPA were

concentrated near the BMZ, consistent with their possible roles in adhesion of basal cells to the BMZ. After detergent extraction the colocalization of ot6134and BPA was more evident at the dermal-epidermal junction. These results indicate major differences between the organizations of/31 and /34 integrins in basal ceils of the skin. a6/34 constitutes a relatively stable structure in skin compared to 131-integrins.
Adhesion of HFKs to ECM Involves Both ~6~4 and ~3B1
We have previously identified c~3/31 in FAs as a mediator of cultured HFK adhesion to secreted ECM, and used this as a model system for basal cell adhesion to the BMZ in skin (Carter et al., 1990). ECM is a better inducer of HFK adhesion than purified laminin, fibronectin, and as good or better than collagen in short-term adhesion assays (1-2 h; Fig. 2). Although larninin is a component of the ECM, purified lami-

Figure 3. Anti-cd/~l (P1B5), but not anti-or6 (GoH3) inhibits HFK spreading on ECM. HFK cells were grown on glass coverslips for 3 d then differentiallyextraet~i with 8 M urea to prepare adherent ECM. HFKs were allowedto adhere to the ECM for 2 h in the presence of control SP2 (A and B), anti-c~6(GoH3, C and D), and anti-cd/51 (P1B5,E and F), washed to remove unbound cells then fixed and permeabilized. The adherent HFKs were stained with anti-쥅6(GoH3; A, C, and E) and the ECM with antilaminin (R5922, B, D, and F). Anti-쥅3/31,but not anti-ix6, inhibited cell spreading on the exogenous laminin-containing ECM, but only partially inhibited cell adhesion.

nln was relatively slow in inducing HFK adhesion. Antio~3/31 (P1B5) or anti-/31 (P4C10) only partially inhibited cell adhesion to ECM (Fig. 2). In contrast, anti-or2/31 (P1H5), anti-c~5/51 (P1D6), and anti-/31 (P4C10) completely blocked HFK adhesion to collagen, fibronectin, and collagerdfibronectin, respectively. An explanation for the partial inhibition was seen in Fig. 3. HFK adhesion and spreading on deposits of ECM was always confined to the ECM spots indicating the dependency of the adhesion on the ECM. The spreading of HFKs on the ECM was completely inhibited by anti-<x3/31

(P1B5; Fig. 3) while attachment was only partially inhibited (Fig. 2, ECM). For the studies in Fig. 3, we have prepared the ECM adhesion surface from long-term HFK cultures grown on BSA-coated glass. The BSA coating retards migration of HFKs and confines the secreted ECM to localized cell colonies. In the absence of the BSA treatment, HFKs deposited ECM over the entire adhesion surface, making it difficult to evaluate the selectivity of HFK adhesion to ECM.
The results from Fig. 2 and 3 suggest that short term HFK adhesion to ECM involves t~3/31and an additional uncharac-

terized adhesion system that does not use a/31-containing integrin. We examined the possible role of ot6/34 as this non-
integrin adhesion receptor. In short term adhesion studies, anti-e6 (GoH3), had no inhibitory effect on HFK spreading (Fig. 3, compare A, C, and E) or attachment (Fig. 2) on exogenous ECM, laminin, collagen, or fibronectin. As an alternate approach, we examined the possibility that ot6/~4 may play an increased role, relative to ~3/~1, in long-term

HFK adhesion studies (18-24 h). In addition, we examined the possibility that o~3B1 might mask the function of o~6/~4. In long-term adhesion studies, HFKs secrete their own endogenous ECM (Figs. 3 and 4) and accumulate 0~3/~1 in FAs as a result of the deposition of a preferred ligand. As exogenous ligands for the long-term adhesion studies, we used collagen (control)-, laminin-, and BSA-coated surfaces. As shown in Fig. 3, HFKs in long-term culture on BSA-coated surfaces, secrete endogenous ECM without the presence of exogenous ligands that can complicate the adhesion studies. Combined PIB5 and GoH3 inhibited HFK adhesion to laminin and ECM (Fig. 4) while adhesion to ECM was partially inhibited by either antibody alone. In control experiments, combined or single antibodies had no effect on cell adhesion (Fig. 4) or spreading (results not shown) on collagen. These results indicate that HFK adhesion to purified exogenous ECM in short-term adhesion and to endogenous ECM in long-term adhesion involves both ot3/31 and ot6/~4.
Localization of ot6B4 and ot3톖 in Distinct Adhesion Structures
The distinction between the organizations of a6/34 and/31containing integrins in skin (Fig. 1) was also observed in cul-
tures of HFKs. ot3/~l localizes to FAs (Fig. 5, A-C) in long-
term cultures on exogenous laminin coincident with the deposition of an ECM (Carter et al., 1990). As previously
reported, a5fll and o~2fll also localized to FAs when HFKs
adhered to fibroneetin and collagen, respectively (Carter et al., 1990). The o~3#l-containing FAs (ot3#l-FAs) were identifiable as black attachment sites in the focal plane of the

Figure5. ~6/34 localizes in a new cell-substrate contact and c~3#1 in FAs of HFKs. HFKs were cultured for 2 d in KGM on glass coverslips
coated with laminin then washed, fixed, permeabilized, and blocked. Each slip was stained with anti-c~3B1(P1F2) and antilaminin (R5922) or anti-c~6(GoH3) and antilaminin antibodies in order to localize receptors and laminin in the same field. Colocalization of the receptors in FAs and basal plaques was determined by the antibody exclusion techniques and by interference reflection microscopy. Bound primary antibodies were detected with species specific FITC- and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. A (anti-c~3/~l), B (anti-laminin), and C (interference reflection) are all the same field. D (anti-c~6), E (antilaminin), and F (interference reflection) are all the same field. Arrows indicate ot3/~l-FAsin contact with the surface in the same position in each field. Brackets indicate ct6/34 in contact with the surface.

HFKs were allowed to adhere to glass coverslips coated with exogenous ECM for 2 h (A-C) or cultured on laminin for 3 d to generate endogenous ECM (D-F and G-l). a3/~l (B, E, and H) and c~6~4(A, D, and G) were identified by incubation with n'LAbP1F2 and GoH3 and were localized in relation to the ligand surface by interference reflection microscopy (C, F, and I). A-C, D-F, and G-I each represent a single field. Arrows indicate the absence ofc~6and the presence of c~3/31in FAs at the leading edge of a migrating cell.

ligand by the antibody exclusion technique (see Materials and Methods). For these experiments, antibodies against laminin were used as a probe of the adhesion surface (Fig. 5 B). Although poorly resolved, the FAs for 0~3/31 were identifiable by interference reflection microscopy (Fig. 5 C).
In contrast, 06/34 localized in relatively large adhesion contacts that were distinct from the/31-integrin containing FAs (Fig. 5, D-F). The tx6/34-contacts localized to the same focal plane as the FAs and in proximity to the ligand-coated surfaces. Consistently, the o~6/34-contacts were detectable by antibody exclusion as relatively large grey areas of partial antibody exclusion in contrast to the small black foci of the FAs (Fig. 5 E). By interference reflection microscopy (Fig. 5 F), the t~6~4 contacts were poorly resolved but detectable as large grey areas that corresponded to the grey areas of antibody exclusion (compare Fig. 5, D-F). The cx6/34contacts were usually in proximity to tx3/31-FAsbut were clearly excluded from FAs (Fig. 5, D-F) as detected with anti-tx6 mAb (GoH3).
a6/34 distributed in three characteristic patterns depending on the time in culture and motility of the HFKs. (a) When

HFKs were allowed to adhere to exogenous ECM for a short period (2 h), cd/31 was localized in FAs at the leading edge of migrating or spreading cells as detected by interference reflection microscopy (Fig. 6, B and C). In contrast, tx6/34 polarized to the trailing edge in the same migrating cell (Fig. 6 A), with no accumulation in contacts or FAs. (b) In stationary spread cells tx6/34 localized in relatively large polymorphic a6134 contacts (Fig. 6, G-I). These tx6/34-contacts were characteristic of cells in culture for multiple days where they secreted ECM. In many cases, the relatively small et3/31-FAs were localized around the periphery of the tx6/34contacts, forming a complex adhesion structure. (c) An intermexiiate organization was also observed with relatively small quantities of tx6/34 surrounding the tx3/31-containing FAs (Fig. 6, D-F). This organization was characteristic of cells spreading on ECM.

The adherent cells and cell residue were stained for BPA (R1086, B, D, F,, H, J, and L) and ct6 (GoH3, A, E, and I),/34 (3El, K), ct3/31 (P1F2, C) or/51 (P4C10, G). ot6/~4codistributes with BPA in SACs.

amined by localizing ot6/34 relative to BPA, a component of the cytoplasmic plaque of hemidesmosomes in skin. 065(Fig. 7, A and B) was found to codistribute with BPA present in cultures of HFKs as components of the adhesion contacts. BPA was usually in proximity to but excluded from ot3/31-FAs (Fig. 7, Cand D) as well as t~2/31-FAsand tx5/31-FAs(results not shown). Like o~6/34, BPA localized to the focal plane of the adhesion surface. The distribution of ot6/34 in contacts was frequently more extensive than BPA; however, when BPA was detected it consistently codistributed with ot6/34.
Further confirmation of the unique character of the
a6/34/BPA contacts compared to a3/31-FAs was apparent in
the relative stabilities of the two adhesion structures. Extraction of adherent HFKs with Triton X-100 detergent removed detectable/31 (Fig. 7 G) and o~3(results not shown) from FAs but had little effect on BPA in the same field (Fig. 7 H). Extraction with Triton X-100, even when followed by extraction with 2 M urea containing 1 M NaCI, failed to remove all or6 (Fig. 7 E),/34 (Fig. 7 K), or codistributing BPA (Fig. 7, F and L), from contacts or from the adhesion surface. Further extraction with 8 M urea removed or denatured detectable ct6 (Fig. 7 I) and/34 (results not shown) on the adhesion surface but left detectable patterns of BPA in the same field (Fig. 7 J ) . Thus, ot/34/BPA contacts and ot3/31-FAs exhibit distinct stabilities in both cell culture and skin.
Based on the unique characteristics of the tx6/34 contacts, we shall refer to the contacts as stable anchoring contacts or SACs to distinguish them from FAs. SACs shall refer to all ot6/34-containing contacts whether BPA is present or not.

The presence of BPA in the ECM associated with the adhesion surface was confirmed by immune precipitation (Fig. 8). Adherent HFKs were metabolically labeled with [35S]methione then sequentially extracted as described in Fig. 7 in order to prepare the detergent/urea-insoluble ECM. The adherent matrix was removed from the adhesion surface by scraping in SDS. BPA was enriched in the SDS extract (Fig.
8, EXTRACT,lane 4) as were other uncharacterized proteins
that represent potential ligands for ot3/31and ot6/34. BPA was immune precipitated from the SDS extract with rabbit polyclonal anti-BPA as a 230-kD protein (Fig. 8, R/P, l a n e / ) consistent with the previously described BPA (Stanley et al., 1981).
a3B1-FAs and atB4-SACs Mediate Distinct Adhesion Functions
We further compared the subcellular organizations of ot3/31FAs and ct6/34-SACs in order to identify possible functional distinctions between the two adhesion complexes, ct3/31-FAs
were origins for actin-containing stress fibers (Fig. 9, A-C) while the c~6/34-SACs(Fig. 9, D-F) that surrounded the FAs
were absent from the origins of the stress fibers. The failure of ot6/54 to associate with actin-containing stress fibers is consistent with the failure of a6/34 to localize to the leading
edge of cells migrating on ECM (Fig. 6, A-C). In contrast,
the association of a 3/31-FAswith stress fibers and their polarized distribution at the leading edge of migrating cells is consistent with their role in dynamic processes such as migration.

to the exogenous ECM. ECM was prepared from HFKs grown on coverslips by sequential extraction, generating an adherent ECM that was insoluble in 8 M urea. The ECM was labeled with antilaminin antibodies. In control figures, the ECM was positive for laminin (Fig. 10 D) and BPA (Fig. 7 J), but lacked any detectable ot6/34 (Fig. 7 1). HFKs were added to the ECM-coated coverslips that had been labeled with antilaminin. The HFKs adhered to the deposits of ECM within I h and the adherent HFKs organized 0t6/34 into SACs (Fig. 10 E) that contacted the exogenous ECM. During the adhesion process, 06/34 formed a stable interaction with the exogenous ECM and this interaction was not dissociated with Triton X-100 (Fig. 10 G). This result indicates that ct6/34 in adhering HFKs rapidly binds to an uncharacterized ligand in the ECM.

Figure 8. Immune precipitation of BPA from the detergentinsoluble matrix of HFKs. (EXTRACT)Confluent cultures of adherent HFKs were metabolically labeled with [35S]methione, washed and extracted sequentially with PBS containing the following in order to prepare an adherent, detergent-insoluble matrix; (Extract 1) 1% Triton X-100, (Extract2) 2 M urea + 1 M NaCI, and (Extract3) 8 M urea. The ECM was then removed from the adhesion surface by addition of 0.5% SDS followed by scraping (Extract4). Each extract was fractionated by SDS-PAGE(8% gel) under reducing conditions and detected by fluorography. Radioimmune precipitation (R/P). The SDS extract was immune precipitated with anti-BPA antibody (R1086, lane 1) or control nonimmune antibody (lane 2) then fractionated by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide gel) and fluorography.
Interaction of tr6~4-SACs and t~3B1-FAs with E C M
Anti-o~6/31 partially inhibits HFK adhesion to ECM and t~6/34/BPA-SACs are resistant to extraction and detachment from the ECM surface with detergent/urea. This suggests that the SACs interact with an uncharacterized ligand in the ECM. For the studies in Fig. 10, we have used antilaminin as a marker of deposited ECM. However, antilaminin does not inhibit HFK adhesion to ECM nor localization of ct3/31 into FAs (Carter et al., 1990). This suggests that laminin may not be the ligand for ix3/31 in the complex ECM. The adhesive ECM contains multiple protein bands that are potential ligands (see Fig. 8, EXTRACZ, lane 4; Carter, W. G., and P. J. Gahr, manuscript in preparation).
The interaction of ct6/34 with ECM was investigated further. We wished to determine if HFK adhesion to an exogenous ECM surface would result in stable binding of o~6/34

Discussion
t~6B4/BPA-SACs in Culture Are Similar to Hemidesmosomes in Skin
Hemidesmosomes have been suggested to mediate basal cell adhesion to the BMZ in skin (Staehelin, 1974). Our results indicate that tx6/34 in cultured HFKs codistributes with BPA in a new SAC that is distinct from/31-containing FAs, but similar to hemidesmosomes in skin. SACs are distinct from FAs based on their unique characteristics as follows (also see Table I and Fig. 11): (a) antibodies against tx6/34, in the presence of anti-o~3/31, inhibit HFK adhesion to ECM (Fig. 4) and localize tx6/34in cell-substrate contact sites (Fig. 5); (b) the formation of o~6/34-SACs occurs only in nonmigrating cells (Fig. 6); (c) BPA codistributes with o~6/34-SACsbut not ct3/31-FAs (Fig. 7); (d) ot6/34/BPA-SACs are relatively stable to detergent/urea extraction (Figs. 1, 7, and 10); and (e) t~6t34SACs are excluded from the origins of actin-containing stress fibers in FAs (Fig. 9). The similarities in composition, stability, cytoskeletal association, and function all suggest that SACs in culture may be related to hemidesmosomes in skin. Further, this is the first demonstration of a cell adhesion function by a hemidesmosome-like structure.
These results indicate that (a) tx6/34may interact with BPA inside the cell in SACs and (b) t~6/34and o~3/31preferentially interact with an uncharacterized ligand(s) in the ECM that may be distinct from purified laminin (see Fig. 11). The carboxy terminus of the 230-kD BPA is localized to the cytoplasmic domain of hemidesmosomes in adherent HFKs (Tanaka et al., 1990)suggesting that BPA is a cytoplasmic protein. However, it is possible that the amino terminus of the 230-kD BPA or the 180 kD form of BPA may be exposed to the extracellular domain. Our results indicate that cytoplasmic BPA of SACs remains associated with the ligands in the 8 M urea-insoluble ECM used in our adhesion studies. Reasonably, 06/34 may also be associated with the ECM as a link between intracellular BPA and extracellular ligand. However, the denaturing extraction conditions used in preparation of the ECM precluded identification of the labile epitopes in et6/34 recognized with mAbs GoH3 and 3El.
ot3B1-FAs and tr6B4-SACs in Adhesion to E C M
The proposed role for o~3/31as a mediator of HFK adhesion to the ECM is based on multiple lines of evidence including inhibition of attachment and spreading with anti-a3/31

(P1B5; Figs. 2-4), and localization of (x3/31 in FAs on ECM (Carter et al., 1990). In addition, a3/31, from other cells has been identified as a receptor for fibronectin/collagen/laminin (Wayner and Carter, 1987) and laminin (Gehlsen et al., 1988, 1989) by affinity chromatography. The data supporting the role of ot6/34 in HFK adhesion includes: (a) inhibition of HFK adhesion to ECM and laminin by combinations of anti-or6/34 (GoH3) with anti-oe3/31 (P1B5), (b) colocalization of ot6f14 in SACs in contact with the adhesion surface, and (c) association of o~654 in SACs in a detergent-insoluble complex with exogenous ECM during adhesion. When or6 is associated with/34, anti-a6/34 (Cheresh et al., 1989) and anti-(x6 (GoH3; Lotz et al., 1990) have been reported to inhibit cell adhesion to laminin. In addition, anti-oe6 (GoH3) has been reported to inhibit platelet adhesion to laminin when or6 is associated with/31 (Sonnenberg et al., 1988).
In our short-term (1-2 h) adhesion studies, the HFK preference for ligands was ECM > collagen > fibronectin )> laminin. In long-term adhesion studies (18-24 h) on laminin and other ligands, HFKs synthesize their own ECM (Carter et al., 1990) and this results in the formation of ot3/31-FAs

and a6fl4-SACs. We have identified a possible ligand for ~6fl4-SACs present in the HFK ECM and BMZ of skin that is distinct from laminin (Carter, W. G., and P. J. Gahr, manuscript in preparation). By using our culture and assay conditions, ex3fll-FAs plays the dominant role in adhesion and spreading on ECM and overshadows the role of (x6/34-SACs. Conceivably, o~6fl4 may play a dominant role in mediating adhesion in other culture systems or in tissue. This possibility is consistent with the localization of o~6B4/BPA at the dermal-epidermal junction in normal skin.
Distinct Adhesion Functions for ~3~I-FAs and ot6B4-SACs
Differences in location, composition, and stability of fll-FAs and o~6B4-SACs (Table I, Fig. 11) suggest distinct functions for these two adhesion structures. Anti-a2B1 (P1H5) and anti-o~5fll (P1FS/P1D6) inhibit cell migration on collagen and fibronectin, respectively (Straus et al., 1989). Similarly, anti-ot3fll (P1B5) inhibits cell migration on ECM since it inhibits spreading and partially detaches HFKs even when

Figure 10. HFKs attach c~6B4to exogenous HFK-ECM in a Triton X-100/urea-insoluble complex. HFKs grown on glass coverslips for
3 d deposit laminin on the adhesion surface (A and B are the same field; A, stained with anti-or6, GoH3; B, antilaminin, R5922). ECM was prepared by sequential extraction of HFKs grown on glass coverslips as seen in A and B. The adherent ECM contained laminin (D, R5922) and BPA but not (x6B4 (C, GoH3) or Bl-containing integrins. The ECM was incubated with antilaminin antiserum (R5922) and washed in order to label the exogenous ECM. HFKs were attached to the prelabeled ECM for 2 h then fixed and permeabilized (E and
F) or extracted with 1% Triton X-100 before fixation (G and H). Adherent HFKs or detergent-insoluble matrix were incubated with anti~x6B4(GoH3) followed by FITC- and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies to detect both the prelabeled laminin in the ECM and c~684 attached to the ECM as a detergent-insoluble complex. The HFKs selectively attached to the laminin-containing ECM spots. Triton extraction of the adherent HFKs left endogenous nt6fl4 (G) attached to the exogenous ECM (H).

added after attachment (Carter et al., 1990). Additional support for the role of FAs in mediating migration of squamous epithelium was provided by Zieske et al. (1989). These results indicate a generalized dynamic role for/31-containing integrins in FAs as mediators of spreading, attachment, and migration through their association with actin-contalning stress fibers and their specific ligands. Conversely, our results indicate that ot6/34-SACs plays an anchoring or retention role based on the following. (a) ot6/$4/BPA-SACs in culture and in tissue are relatively stable to extraction with detergent/urea. (b) SACs form only in nonmigrating cells. (c) SACs do not associate with contractile actin-contalning stress fibers important for motility.
The lack of t~6/34 codistribution with actin-containlng

stress fibers is consistent with the published sequence for/34 (Hogervorst et al., 1990; Suzuki and Naitoh, 1990). Most of the peptide sequence of/34 lies within the cytoplasm and has little homology to/31. Conceivably the unique cytoplasmic domain of/34 may preferentially interact with BPA in SACs, directly or indirectly, instead of with actin filaments.
We suggest that interaction of a6/34/BPA-SACs with the BMZ-like ECM in cultured HFKs may play a role in restricting cell motility on the ECM. These components may play a similar role in anchoring the basal cells to the BMZ in the form of hemidesmosomes in skin. In contrast, the relatively unstable but dynamic ot3/31-FAs mediate motility functions in HFK-ECM interactions, o,3/31and ot2~51can also relocate to cell-cell junctions in differentiating keratinocytes where

they may function in cell-cell interactions (Kaufmann et al., 1989; Larjava et al., 1990; Carter et al., 1990). The dynamic character of a3B1 may facilitate movement of daughter cells away from the BMZ and mediate stratification of the skin (Carter et al., 1990). Proper morphogenesis would require a balance of SACs and FAs to mediate adhesive functions. Conceivably, low expression of ot6B4 or BPA would permit the function of the motile/~l-integrins to predominate with possible cell invasion of the dermis.

PROPERTIES OF THE ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC SUPPRESSIVE T-CELL FACTOR IN THE REGULATION
OF ANTIBODY RESPONSE OF THE MOUSE* III. Dual Gene Control of the T-Cell-Mediated Suppression
of the Antibody Response
BY MASARU TANIGUCHI, TOMIO TADA, AND TAKESHI TOKUHISA (From The Laboratories forImmunology ,School ofMedicine, Chiba University,Chiba, Japan 280)

Our previous studies demonstrated an antigen-specific T-cell factor that can suppress primary and secondary IgG antibody response of mice in both in vivo and in vitro experimental conditions (1, 2), The factor was extractable from thymocytes and spleen cells of mice that had been immunized with a relatively high dose of carrier antigens, and exerted a suppressive effect on the antibody response against a hapten coupled to the same carrier. The specificity of this factor was firmly established by its binding affinity for the antigen, although no immunoglobulin determinants were detectable by absorption studies using various anti-immunoglobulin antisera. The molecular weight of the T-cell factor was between 35,000 and 55,000 daltons, the value being much lower than those of immunoglobulins. Available evidence indicated that the factor suppresses the helper T cell having the same carrier specificity for the antigen rather than the hapten-specific B cell.
Further studies demonstrated that the T-cell factor is a product of a gene or genes present in the major histecompatibility complex. It has been shown that the suppressive activity was consistently removed by absorption with alloantisera reactive with the products of genes in the I region of the H-2 complex, more exactly in the I-A and/orI-B subregions (2, 3). In keeping with these findings, it has also been shown that the T-cell factor derived from one strain of mice can only suppress the response of syngeneic and H-2 histocompatible mouse strains, indicating that identities among genes in the H-2 complex between the suppressor T cells and their target cells are required for effective suppression (1, 3). The most feasible explanation for this histocompatibility requirement is that the acceptor site of the target cells to the suppressive T-cell factor is also determined by a gene or genes in the H-2 complex, and thus a complementation of paired genes in the H-2 complex is required for the suppressive cell interaction. The present investigation was undertaken to determine whether such a two-gene model is, in fact, applicable to the suppressive cell interactions, and to further determine the target cells expressing such acceptor sites.

Materials and Methods
Animals. BALB/cAnN, CBA, C3H/He, A/J, C57BL/6J, SJL, and their F~ hybrids were produced in our animal facilities. Congeneic strains of B10 background were also raised in our animal facility. Breeding pairs of B10, B10.BR, B10.D2, and B10.A were kindly provided by Dr. K. Moriwaki of the National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan. B10.S are the gift of Dr. C. S. David of the Department of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Mo.
Antigens. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) j was purchased from Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif. Dinitrophenylated KLH (DNP77o-KLH) was prepared by coupling with DNP-sulfonic acid according to the method by Eisen et al. (4).
Immunization of Animals. To prepare the suppressive T-cell factor, animals were immunized with two intraperitoneal injections of 100 fig of soluble KLH without adjuvant at a 2-wk interval. They were killed 2 wk after the second immunization, and their thymuses and spleens were processed as below.
To obtain DNP-KLH-primed spleen cells, mice were primed with 100 gg of DNP-KLH with 1  109Bordetella pertussis vaccine. They were killed by exsanguination 4 wk after the priming, and their spleen cells were harvested.
Preparation of the Suppressive T-Cell Factor. The thymuses and spleens of KLH-primed mice were placed in a small quantity of chilled Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM). They were minced by forceps and then gently pressed between two glass slides to release the cells. The cells were washed three times with cold MEM, and were suspended in a small quantity of MEM to make the suspension of 5  10S/ml. The suspension was then subjected to sonication for 2 rain in ice with a Tomy UR-150P Sonicator, Tomy Seiko Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. The cell-free supernate was obtained by ultracentrifugation at 40,000 g for I h. In most of our present experiments, thymocyte extract (T extract) was used to achieve in vitro suppression of the antibody response.
Cell Culture Technique. The modified Marbrook culture system was utilized to induce haptenspecific in vitro secondary response of primed spleen cells as described in the previous paper (2). In brief, mice were primed with an intraperitoneal injection of 100 gg of DNP-KLH mixed with 10y B. pertussis vaccine. 4 wk after the immunization, 107 of primed spleen cells were cultured with 0.1 gg of DNP-KLH in MEM enriched with 10% fetal calf serum (Grand Island Biological Co., Grand Island, N. Y.) in Marbrook culture system (5). The culture was maintained at 37캜 in an atmosphere of 10% of CO2 in air for 5 days. The suppressive T extract at a dose comparable to 107 original thymocytes was added at the beginning of the culture. After a 5-day culture, the numbers of DNP-specific IgG plaque-forming cells (PFC) were assayed using sheep erythrocytes coupled with DNP31-bevine serum albumin as described previously (2).

Results
Requirement of Histocompatibility for Effective Suppression. Our previous
study indicated that the suppressive T-cell factor of BALB/c strain could not suppress the antibody response of histoincompatible C57BL/6J mice (and vice versa) in in vivo experiments (1). Therefore, we have attempted to study this histocompatibility requirement using various combinations of mouse strains and their F~ hybrids as the donors and recipients of the suppressive T-cell factor. KLH-specific T-cell factor was obtained from BALB/c, C3H, CBA, and (BALB/c  CBA)F1, and was added to the culture of DNP-KLH-primed spleen cells of various strains of mice. The combinations of the donor and recipient are shown in Table I. The numbers of indirect (IgG) PFC after a 5-day culture with and without the suppressive T-cell factor were compared.
As may be inferred from Table I, the suppressive T-cell factor from one strain

of mice can greatly suppress the responses of H-2 histocompatible strains. Thus the BALB/c factor can suppress the BALB/c response, but not C3H, CBA, and A/ J responses. Similarly the H-2 k factors derived from CBA and C3H mice could equally suppress both CBA and C3H responses, while failing to suppress the response of BALB/c having different H-2 haplotype. The T-cell factor obtained from (BALB/c  CBA)F1 could suppress the response of syngeneic F1 as well as those of both parental strains. Therefore, the suppressor molecules reactive to both parental strains are codominantly expressed in F1 suppressor T cells. It was also shown that the responses of (BALB/c  CBA)FI and (BALB/c  A/J)FI cells were suppressible either by H-2 d or H-2 k factors, indicating that the acceptor sites for both factors are codominantly expressed on F~ spleen cells.
A n important point in this experiment is that the factors from C B A and C 3 H (H-2 k) mice but not B A L B / c (H-2 d) mice can suppress the response ofA/J (H-2 a) mice which share the same K and ! regions with H-2 k strains. Also, the H-2 k factor can suppress the response of (BALB/c x A/J)F1 mice. Therefore, itis clear that the identities among genes in the K and I regions of the H-2 complex between the donor and recipient are both necessary and sufficient for the effective suppression in cross-strain experiments. Definitely no suppression was observed in any combinations of H - 2 histoincompatible strains so far tested.
Failure to Produce the Suppressive T-CeU Factor in A/J Strain. As mentioned previously, the T-cell factor from H-2 k mice can suppress the response of A/J mice, implying that spleen cells of A/J mice have acceptor sites for the H-2 k

factor. However, the T extract obtained from A/J mice consistently failed to suppress A/J, CBA, and C3H responses as depicted in Table II. We have confirmed several times this peculiar behavior of A/J mice with different antigen doses and immunization schedules.
Even more peculiar is the genetic trait of this inability to produce the suppressive T-cell factor. When (BALB/c x A/J)F1 was used as the donor, the Tcellfactorfrom this FI could suppress responses of beth (BALB/c x A/J)F~ and
BALB/c, but not the response of the other parental partner A/J. The F~ factor
also failedto suppress the responses ofH-2 k mice (CBA and C3H). Therefore, the
production ofthe suppressive T-cellfactorper se isgeneticallydominant, but the
produced factor is strictlystrain-specific,and thus the inabilityto produce the
H - 2 k reactive factor of A/J mice is also inherited by the F~ mice (Table II). Inability to Express the Acceptor Site for the Suppressive T-Cell Factor in BIO
Congeneic Strains. Quite contrary to A/J strain, several congeneic strains of B10 background were shown to lack the expression of acceptor site for the H-2 compatible suppressive T-cell factor, while being able to produce the factor itself. The T-cell extracts were obtained from B10, B10.D2, B10.BR, B10.A, and B10.S strains, and were tested in syngeneic and H-2 histocompatible target cells. As shown in Table III, the extracts from B10 congeneic strains did not suppress the responses of syngeneic spleen cells, whereas the same extract could suppress the responses of H-2 histecompatible partners of non-B10 background. Similarly, the extracts derived from non-B10 background, despite having the definite suppressive activity in syngeneic combinations, could not suppress the responses ofH-2 identical B10 congeneic strains. Thus for example, the response of B10.S spleen cells was not suppressed by either syngeneic B10.S or the H-2 identical SJL T-cell factor. On the other hand, both the T-cell extracts of B10.S and SJL could suppress the response of SJL only, but not the B10.S response. Furthermore, in some cases a definite enhancement was observed in the response of B10 congeneic strains given the T-cell extract which had been shown to be inhibitory in H-2 identical partners. From this series of experiments, it was concluded that congeneic strains of B10 background can produce the suppressive T-cell factor which suppresses the response of other H-2 histocompatible spleen cells, but are incapable of accepting the suppressive T-cell factor from either syngeneic or H-2 identical strains. This conclusion will be reinforced by the failure of absorption of the T-cell factor by spleen cells of B10 congeneic mice as will be shown below.
The Genetic Trait of the Suppressor-Acceptor Expressions. Since A/J and B10.A both having the same H-2 haplotype lack one of the expressions of the suppressor or acceptor, we crossed these strains to obtain their FI hybrid. The ability of the (A/J  B10.A)F~ to produce the suppressive T-cell factor as well as to accept the factor was tested by combinations of F1 and parents as the donor and recipient.
As shown in Table IV, the (A/J  B10.A)F1 could produce the T-cell factor which can suppress both A/J and F~ responses. The same factor could not suppress the response of the other parental strain B10.A which lacks the acceptor site. Similarly, the response of (A/J x B10.A)F~ is suppressible by the factors derived from F~ and B10.A but not from A/J. Thus both the suppressor and accepter are dominantly expressed on the cells of F~ whose parents lack

either one of these expressions. Presence of an Acceptor Site for the Suppressive T-Cell Factor on T Cells but
not on B Cells and Macrophages. The results stated above indicate that only H-2 histocompatible partner can accept the suppressive T-cell factor of other strains, and such an acceptor site is lacking in certain strains. We have already presented an indirect evidence in a previous publication (2) that the target of the suppressive T-cell factor is the T cell but not B cell. This was based on the fact that the suppressive T-cell factor did not suppress the in vitro antibody response unless the helper T cell having an identical specificity to the suppressive T-cell factor coexisted. The result suggested that the factor does not act directly on B cells, but may suppress the helper T cell resulting in the overall reduction of antibody response.
To obtain more direct evidence for the presence of acceptor sites on T cells, the suppressive T extract was absorbed with various cell types from normal syngeneic or allogeneic mice. Suspensions of thymocytes, spleen cells, and bone marrow cells were obtained from normal C3H and BALB/c mice. A fraction of non-O-bearing cells was obtained by treatment of spleen cells with anti-0 and complement. Macrophages were obtained as the glass-adherent peritoneal exudate cells. An aliquot of the suppressive T-cell extract corresponding to 5 x 107 thymocytes was incubated with 1 to 2 x 108 of each cell type at 4캜 for 1 h with constant agitation. The cells were spun down, the supernate was sterilized by passing through a millipore membrane filter, and the residual suppressive activity was assayed by adding the supernate to the culture of primed spleen cells.
Table V demonstrates that the suppressive activity of the T extract can be removed by incubation with syngeneic thymocytes and spleen cells, but not with anti-0-treated spleen cells, peritoneal macrophages, or bone marrow cells in both C3H and BALB/c mice. It was noted that a larger number of thymocytes was always required for the complete removal of the suppressive activity, suggesting that only a certain proportion of thymocytes expresses the acceptor site or that the density of the acceptor site on thymocytes is lower than that on spleen cells. The cells expressing the acceptor site in spleen cells are anti-0 sensitive. These results infer that the acceptor site for the suppressor molecule

is, in fact, present on the surface of a T-cell subpopulation but not on B cells and macrophages.
Similar absorption experiments were performed using the spleen cells from H2 histocompatible and incompatible strains as well as those from B10 congeneic strains that had been shown to possess no ability to accept the suppressive T-cell factor. As shown in Table VI, the suppressive activity of the BALB/c T-cell factor was completely absorbed with the spleen cells of BALB/c and (BALB/c  CBA)F1 but not with those from histoincompatible A/J and C3H. It was also shown that the spleen cells of B10.D2 could not absorb the BALB/c T-cell factor even though B10.D2 has the same H-2 complex as BALB/c. Similarly, the C3H factor can be absorbed with spleen cells of C3H, CBA, (BALB/c  CBA)F,, and

The results clearly indicate that the T-cell factor can be absorbed with splenic T cells having identical K and I regions to the donor of the T-cell factor, and that the nonacceptor strains of B10 congeneic lines, in fact, do not express the acceptor site for the histocompatible T-cell factors.

Discussion
The results presented in this paper indicate that there exist at least two distinct types of molecules, both determined by genes in the H-2 complex, which play a consequential role in the T-cell-mediated suppression of the antibody response. These are the antigen-specific T-cell factor which has been described previously (1, 2), and the acceptor molecule for the T-cell factor which is expressed on the surface of a certain T-cell subpopulation. This conclusion is derived from a series of experiments all of which point to the dual gene regulation in the T-cell-mediated suppression: First, it has clearly been demonstrated that identities of genes in the H-2 complex between the donor of the Tcell factor and the responding target cells are definitely required for the elicitation of effective suppression. In general, identities among genes in the left side half (K end) of the H-2 complex are found to be both necessary and sufficient. This suggests that the gene(s) coding for the acceptor site is also located in the left side half of the H-2 complex, as is the gene for the T-cell factor, and that the complementation of these two gene products is required for the induction of suppression.
Secondly, in the F1 hybrid of different H-2 haplotype strains, the molecules having the suppressive activity for both parental strain responses are codominantly expressed on F1 suppressor T cells. Similarly, the acceptor sites for both parental suppressive T-cell factors are expressed on FI target cells. Thus the parental T-cell factors can suppress the response of F~, and the F~ T-cell factors can suppress the responses of both parental strains.
The presence of such acceptor sites on T cells but not B cells and macrophages was clearly demonstrated by successful removal of the suppressive activity by incubation of the suppressive T-cell extract with thymocytes and spleen cells, but not with bone marrow cells, peritoneal macrophages, and anti-P-treated spleen cells. Furthermore, H-2 histoincompatible spleen cells always failed to

absorb the suppressive activity. The results indicate that the acceptor site is expressed only on the surface of T cells, and this expression is also determined by genes in the H-2 complex. These findings are consistent with the two-gene model originally presented by Munro and Taussig (6) and Taussig et al. (7) in cooperative interactions between T and B cells in the induction of antibody response, although the acceptor site for the cooperative T-cell signal is expressed only on B cells.
The evidence that the functionally different molecules, i.e. suppressor and acceptor molecules, are actually two distinct gene products was further demonstrated by the occurrence of two types of defect in gene expressions. One example is the A/J strain which could not produce the suppressor molecule, while being able to accept the T-cell factor produced by other H-2 a and H-2 k

strains. Thus, the A/J strain lacks the expression ofthe suppressor gene, but the expression of the acceptor gene is intact. On the contrary, several congeneic lines of B10 background could produce the suppressive T-cell factor which was effective in suppressing the response of H-2 histocompatible strains of non-B10 background. However, these B10 congeneic mice could not accept the suppressive T-cell factor produced by H-2 histocompatible partners of non-B10 background. The lack of expression of the acceptor site on the spleen cells of B10 congeneic mice was further supported by the consistent failure of absorption of the histocompatible T-cell factor by their spleen cells. Since A/J and B10.A share the identical H-2 haplotype, the observed difference indicates that the expression of suppressor and acceptor genes may be regulated by separate regulatory genes not linked to the H-2 complex.
One further interesting observation in this respect is that the T-cell extract from (BALB/c x A/J)F, mice could suppress both syngeneic F, and BALB/c responses but not A/J, C3H, and CBA responses. This indicates that although the ability to produce the suppressive T-cell factor is a dominant trait, the produced factor is reactive only with the acceptor of H-2 d. Therefore, the inability of A/J mice to produce the H-2 k reactive T-cell factor is simultaneously inherited by the F, mice. However, if A/J (nonproducer) and B10.A (nonacceptor) were crossed to produce their F, hybrid, the F, mice could produce the factor which can suppress both F1 and A/J. The results clearly indicate that both expressions of the suppressor and acceptor are dominant traits.
Although the regulatory mechanisms involved in the expression of either molecule are not known, the incidence of such exceptional strains indicates that the suppressor and its acceptor are distinct molecules both coded for by genes in the H-2 complex, and that the suppressor phenomenon is controlled by at least two genes in the H-2 complex. It should be concluded that the complementation of these two gene products is definitely required for the expression of T-cell-

mediated suppression. Defects in either type of gene would cause a defective homeostatic regulation of the antibody response.
In fact, we are aware of the interesting findings reported by Cerottini and Unanue (8), who showed that A/J strain is an extremely high responder to KLH, while CBA is a low responder, and that this responsiveness to KLH is not linked to the H-2 complex. In view of the present observation, such a high responsiveness observed in A/J mice might be due to the lack of expression of the KLHspecific suppressor gene, although the response itself is not under H-linked Ir gene control. It seems possible that the strain differences in the responsiveness against various complex protein antigens may be at least in part explained by the suppressor and/or acceptor gene expression, rather than by Ir gene control.
There are several important problems to be solved in the future. Although the T-cell-mediated suppression may be explained by the two-gene hypothesis, the expression of both genes is clearly regulated by other genes not linked to the H-2 complex. For example, since all the congeneic lines of B10 background so far tested do not express the acceptor site, the expression is apparently regulated by genes on background chromosomes. As C57BL/6J can accept the H-2 bfactor, the ability to express the acceptor gene is determined by the portion not shared by B10 and C57BL/6J, which is very little indeed. Secondary, although it is now clear that the cells expressing the acceptor site are T cell, we do not know whether they are helper T cells or other cell types. Our more recent observation indicated that the cells capable of absorbing the suppressive T-cell factor are nylon wool-adherent 0-bearing cells. Since most of the helper activity is present in the nonadherent cell fraction, the possibility should be considered that the factor may act on a distinct subpopulation of T cell from helper T cell, and that such cells armed by the factor may in fact be active in the actual suppression of the antibody response. It has recently been proposed by Eardley and Gershon (9) that the suppressor T cell, when transferred into the host, may induce a new population of suppressor cells of the host origin that actually participates in the suppression of antibody response. Thirdly, we are still not able to determine the subregions which code for both suppressor and acceptor molecules. A succeeding paper will describe our latest results which indicate the unambiguous region assignment of the suppressor gene among I subregions. 2
Finally, the present results are in keeping with the recent discoveries of the complementation of two Ir genes in the initiation of antibody responses (6, 7, 1012). These include complementations of genes at the level of T cells and at both T- and B-cell levels. Munro and Taussig (6) suggested that one Ir gene codes for a T-cell factor and the other codes for the acceptor on the B cell. More recent studies by Dorf et al. (11) and Doff and Benacerraf (12) suggest that a complementation ofIr gene would occur at the level ofT cell. Our results, although the effect was opposite to that observed by these investigators, indicate that the complementation of the suppressor and acceptor genes may take place strictly at the T-cell level, and that the target of the suppressive T-cell factor is the T cell.

products lies in that there is a strict histocompatibility requirement for the suppressive cell interaction, a fact which was not observed in the study of the cooperative T-cell factor (7). The present results being corroborated by the findings of others would add a strong evidence that several cooperative and suppressive cell interactions are mediated by I region gene products forming the network of the immune system.

Summary
The antigen-specific suppressive T-cell factor of mice, which had previously been shown to be an I region gene product, could effectively suppress the in vitro secondary antibody response of spleen cells from syngeneic or H-2 compatible mouse strains but not that of H-2 incompatible strains. The identities among genes in the left side half (K, I-A, and I-B) ofthe H-2 complex between the donor and recipient strains were found to be both necessary and sufficient for the induction of suppression. This suggests that the acceptor site for the suppressive T-cell factor is also determined by the gene present in the left side half of the H-2 complex. The cell type which expresses the acceptor site was found to be a subset of T cell. In general, the suppressive T-cell factor obtained from F1 mice could suppress the responses of both parental strains, and the parental factors could suppress the response of F1 mice. The results indicate that both suppressor and acceptor molecules are codominantly expressed on F1 T cells.
There were found two types of defects in the expression of suppressor and acceptor molecules among mouse strains: A/J mice could not produce the suppressive T-cell factor despite that they could accept the factor produced by other H-2 compatible mouse strains. In contrast, all the B10 congeneic lines could produce the T-cell factor, but could not accept the factor produced by syngeneic and H-2 compatible non-B10 congeneic lines. The FI hybrid of A/J and B10.A could both produce and accept the T-cell factor, and thus the expressions of suppressor and acceptor molecules were found to be dominant traits. These results indicate that the antigen-specific T-cell-mediated suppression is regulated by at least two genes both present in the H-2 complex, and that the complementation of these two genes is required for the induction of suppression.

CD45 regulates retention, motility, and numbers of hematopoietic progenitors, and affects osteoclast remodeling of metaphyseal trabecules

The CD45 phosphatase is uniquely expressed by all leukocytes, but its role in regulating hematopoietic progenitors is poorly understood. We show that enhanced CD45 expression on bone marrow (BM) leukocytes correlates with increased cell motility in response to stress signals. Moreover, immature CD45 knockout (KO) cells showed defective motility, including reduced homing (both steady state and in response to stromal-derived factor 1) and reduced granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilization. These defects were associated with increased cell adhesion mediated by reduced matrix metalloproteinase 9 secretion and imbalanced Src kinase activity. Poor mobilization of CD45KO progenitors by the receptor activator of nuclear factor B ligand, and impaired modulation of the endosteal components osteopontin and stem cell factor, suggested defective osteoclast function. Indeed, CD45KO osteoclasts exhibited impaired bone remodeling and abnormal morphology, which we attributed to defective cell fusion and Src function. This led to irregular distribution of metaphyseal bone trabecules, a region enriched with stem cell niches. Consequently, CD45KO mice had less primitive cells in the BM and increased numbers of these cells in the spleen, yet with reduced homing and repopulation potential. Uncoupling environmental and intrinsic defects in chimeric mice, we demonstrated that CD45 regulates progenitor movement and retention by influencing both the hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic compartments.

Hematopoiesis is associated with primitive stem cell proliferation and differentiation leading to the production of maturing cells in the BM, followed by their continuous release to the circulation. One of the basic characteristics of immature and maturing hematopoietic cells is their unique ability to migrate between different organs, particularly in and out of the BM, as manifested during both homeostasis and stress conditions (1).
Egress of progenitors and maturing cells from the BM is accelerated during alarm situations that are associated with urgent needs to rapidly cope with physiological demands, such as host defense and repair. This process is termed "mobilization," and it is induced by different stimulations, including cytokines and inflammatory and chemotherapeutic agents. The cytokine G-CSF is clini-

cally used to induce stem cell mobilization as a source harvested for BM transplantation protocols (2-5). The migration of circulating progenitor cells back to their BM is termed "homing," a multistep process in which the immature cells actively cross the endothelium barrier between the circulation and the BM compartment. Homing has physiological roles in adult BM homeostasis and in the course of BM repopulation during stem cell transplantations in patients (6).
Both mobilization and homing require active navigation and use partially overlapping

mechanisms (7). These complex processes involve an interplay between cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and proteolytic enzymes. Adhesion molecules, including members of the 1 and 2 integrins, are crucial for undifferentiated cell retention in their BM niches, maintaining the stem cell pool and function. Breakdown of this anchorage is essential for progenitor cell release (3, 8). Proliferation and migration of primitive cells are regulated by various cytokines and chemokines such as stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF 1; also termed CXCL12), its receptor CXCR4, and the cytokine stem cell factor (SCF) (7, 9-11). Proteolytic enzymes, especially metalloproteinases (MMPs), play central roles in various steps of stem cell mobilization and homing. These enzymes cleave different adhesion interactions, extracellular matrix components, and cytokines, which further facilitate cell egress through the mechanical and endothelial barriers (9, 12-15). Recently, we suggested a new regulator of progenitor cell mobilization by demonstrating that bone-degrading osteoclasts play a major role in homeostatic release and selective stress-induced progenitor cell mobilization (16). These hematopoietic-derived multinucleated, fused giant cells are involved in bone remodeling processes. Different players regulate osteoclast development, recruitment, and function in their bone resorbing sites. The seven-transmembrane-region receptor DC-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP) was shown to mediate cell-cell fusion of osteoclast precursors and the assembly of multinucleated cells (17). In addition, Src kinases were shown to be involved in sealing zone formation (18), and osteoclast motility is regulated by MMP expression and secretion (for review see reference 19). The role of osteoclasts in progenitor cell mobilization involves cleavage of endosteal components such as SDF-1, SCF, and osteopontin, which are regulators of stem cell anchorage and retention (16). Previous studies have introduced the linkage between bone remodeling, regulation of hematopoiesis, and the dynamic nature of BM stem cell niches (5). However, in spite of extensive experiments, the exact mechanisms and regulators underlying the migration, localization, and retention of hematopoietic progenitor cells have not been fully elucidated.
All leukocytes, including hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell populations, are characterized by unique cell surface expression of CD45. CD45 is a transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase. It dephosphorylates different sites on Src family kinases, and can serve as both a positive and negative regulator in a cell type- and context-dependent manner (20, 21). CD45 was shown to regulate different stages of lymphocyte maturation (22), especially their activation and proliferation (23, 24). However, its potential role in the function of earlier, undifferentiated hematopoietic progenitor cells was not identified. The distinctive expression of CD45 led us to postulate that this phosphatase may regulate fundamental processes of immature hematopoietic cells. Our results show that CD45 has multiple roles in regulating the cell autonomous motility of progenitor cells and retention of these cells in the BM, as well as osteoclast-mediated remodeling of the metaphyseal bone trabecules.

RESULTS CD45 expression is dynamically modulated by stress signals To evaluate the potential involvement of the panleukocyte CD45 phosphatase in the mobilization and recruitment of immature cells, we tested its expression levels in response to stress signals. G-CSF stimulations significantly increased expression of CD45 by mononuclear cells (MNCs) in the BM (Fig. 1, A and B). CD45 up-regulation in the BM was observed in mature leukocytes such as lymphoid CD4+ and myeloid CD11b+ cells and, moreover, in immature hematopoietic c-Kit+ progenitors (Fig. 1 C). Similar results were obtained when mice were stimulated with LPS, mimicking bacterial-induced inflammation (Fig. 1 D). This increase in CD45 expression on BM leukocytes correlated with their release to the circulation during G-CSF mobilization (Fig. 1 E). CD45 expression was elevated by 1.3-fold on day 1 and by 1.5-fold on day 3, reaching 1.6-fold on day 5, when both cell mobilization and CD45 levels gained their peak values. Hence, G-CSF treatment led to a gradual increase in the expression of CD45 on BM cells before their egress. Interestingly, we observed in the circulation a reduction in CD45 expression on mobilized cells compared with untreated blood cells (Fig. 1, A and B). These results reveal that CD45 expression is modulated during cell mobilization, suggesting that dynamic CD45 expression participates in egress from the BM in response to different stress signals.
Impaired progenitor expansion and reduced mobilization in mice lacking CD45 To further elucidate the role of CD45 in cell egress, the model of CD45KO mice was used. We tested the potential of CD45KO cells to egress from the BM under steady-state conditions and in response to G-CSF stimulations. Importantly, differential BM cell count demonstrated no major differences in the composition of mature cells obtained from WT versus CD45KO mice (unpublished data). As shown by others (23), we also did not detect substantial differences in the total numbers of circulating white blood cells (WBCs) in untreated CD45KO and WT mice (Fig. 1 E). However, G-CSF stimulations in CD45KO mice resulted in a delayed and reduced response. A suboptimal protocol of G-CSF, administrated for 3 d only compared with the optimal protocol of 5 d, was tested. After 3 d of injections, we documented a significant reduction (50%) in the number of mobilized WBCs in the circulation of CD45KO mice compared with their WT counterparts. Of note, in this suboptimal protocol the numbers of mobilized WT cells were already very high, near their peak levels, as documented after 5 d of stimulations (Fig. 1 E). Notably, mobilization of immature CD45KO progenitor cells was also significantly impaired, which is reflected by the frequency of circulating colony-forming cells (CFCs) (Fig. 1 F). Moreover, we found in the peripheral blood (PB) of CD45KO mice lower numbers of primitive Sca-1+/c-Kit+/Lin (SKL) cells (a rare population shown to contain most of the stem cell activity) after 3 d of G-CSF injections (Fig. 1, G and I).

G-CSF-induced mobilization (25). We therefore examined the ability of primitive BM cells to expand in vivo in response to G-CSF stimulations. After 3 d of G-CSF treatment, CFCs in the WT BM increased their numbers by 1.5-fold

(Fig. 1 H). However, in the CD45KO mice, we first observed that untreated mice have a priori lower numbers of CFCs in the BM. Of note, CD45KO CFCs expanded to a lower extent in response to G-CSF stimulation for 3 d, a time frame

in which the number of immature progenitors in the WT BM has already reached a plateau (Fig. 1 H). Importantly, reduced numbers of primitive CD45KO SKL cells were also documented in the BM after G-CSF stimulation compared with their WT counterparts (Fig. 1 I).
Reduced motility and response to SDF-1 are associated with impaired homing of CD45KO progenitors The lower numbers of progenitors in the CD45KO BM may lead to their reduced appearance in the PB after G-CSF treatment. To examine if CD45 is directly involved in progenitor cell motility, we isolated BM subpopulations from CD45KO mice and evaluated their spontaneous and SDF-1-induced migration potential. The migration of CD45KO MNCs was significantly reduced compared with WT cells (Fig. 2 A), including both spontaneous as well as SDF-1-directional migration. Of note, no differences were observed in the expression of CXCR4, the receptor for SDF-1 (unpublished data). MNCs isolated from the BM of G-CSF-treated mice exhibited higher motility compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2 A). This high motility of GCSF-treated WT cells correlated with their increased CD45 expression levels (Fig. 1, A and B). However, reduced migration was observed in cells obtained from CD45KO mice despite G-CSF treatment. Importantly, although normal mobilization levels were observed after 5 d of G-CSF administration, CD45KO BM MNCs still demonstrated reduced spontaneous and SDF-1 migration compared with their WT counterparts (Fig. 2 A). When CD45KO BM MNCs were allowed to migrate through a fibronectin (FN)-coated barrier, stronger reductions in their migration were observed (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that together with their intrinsic defects in cell motility, CD45KO cells predominantly have an impaired ability to cross extracellular matrix barriers. This notion was further evident in vivo, as CD45KO MNCs showed reduced homing compared with their WT counterparts (Fig. 2 C). Next, we examined the motility potential of sorted representative subpopulations that strongly respond to G-CSF: CD11b+ monocytes and c-Kit+ enriched progenitor cells. These cell fractions were isolated from the BM of WT and CD45KO mice untreated or treated with G-CSF for 5 d. As observed with the MNC population, CD45KO CD11b+ monocytes showed reduced spontaneous and SDF-1-mediated migration compared with WT CD11b+ cells (Fig. 2 D). Similarly, CD45KO CD11b+ cells demonstrated reduced homing to the BM of the recipient mice (Fig. 2 E). Live cell images show that immature WT c-Kit+ cells responded to SDF-1 chemotactic signals by cell spreading and the formation of elongated protrusions (Fig. 2 F, left). In contrast, immature CD45KO c-Kit+ cells remained mostly round, forming only short cell protrusions in response to SDF-1 (Fig. 2 F, right). In vivo homing assays demonstrated the inferior homing of CD45KO c-Kit+ progenitors to the BM and spleen, in comparison to their WT counterparts (Fig. 2 G). Interestingly, CD45KO spleen-derived colony-forming progenitor cells also exhibited poor homing potential to the BM and spleen of recipient mice (Fig. 2 H). Additionally, in a functional repopulation assay, CD45KO spleen-derived cells showed
2384

a reduced potential to engraft the BM of WT recipients, also showing defects in primitive repopulating cells (Fig. 2 I). These results demonstrate systemic cell autonomous defects in CD45KO cell motility.
Reduced MMP-9 secretion and hyperadhesion of CD45KO cells To elucidate possible mechanisms underlying CD45-regulated cell motility, we assessed the secretion potential of MMPs, in particular of MMP-9, which is involved in hematopoietic cell invasion and is up-regulated upon stress signals (4, 9, 26). BM and PB MNCs of CD45KO mice secreted lower levels of pro-MMP-9 compared with their WT counterparts (Fig. 3, A and B). In vivo 3-d G-CSF stimulations increased secretion of this enzyme by both WT BM and PB MNCs (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, MNCs obtained from G-CSF-treated CD45KO mice still secreted significantly lower levels of pro- MMP-9 (Fig. 3, A and B).
Retention of leukocytes in the BM requires a concomitant balance of adhesion and detachment. The role of CD45 in these processes was therefore studied. We found significantly elevated expression levels of activated 1 integrin in BM MNCs obtained from CD45KO mice (twofold higher than their WT counterparts; Fig. 3 C). This phenomenon was associated with an increased adhesion capacity to FN (Fig. 3 D). This hyperadhesion of CD45KO cells may further explain their poor motility both in vitro and in vivo.
CD45 deficiency leads to hyperactivation of the Src signaling pathway Several papers have demonstrated the importance of Src kinases, the natural substrate of CD45, in integrin-mediated adhesion in various mature lymphoid and myeloid cells (27, 28). We thus examined the Src phosphorylation status and activity during steady state and in response to G-CSF administration. G-CSF stimulations of WT mice led to a reduction in Src phosphorylation and activity in BM MNCs (Fig. 3, E and F). Notably, these modulations in Src were inversely correlated with CD45 expression (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, MNCs derived from the BM of untreated CD45KO mice displayed enhanced Src phosphorylation and activity (Fig. 3, E and F), and G-CSF stimulations only slightly reduced it in these CD45KO cells. Src family kinases were shown to negatively regulate the mitogenactivated protein kinase cascades, particularly extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) activation (29). As Fig. 3 G shows, G-CSF treatment activated Erk protein in WT-derived BM cells, suggesting that Src kinase activity is indeed reduced. Interestingly, in the CD45KO BM, where Src kinases are hyperactive, Erk proteins are inhibited, as demonstrated by the low phosphorylation of Erk both in untreated and in G-CSF-treated mice. Finally, inhibition of Src proteins in CD45KO BM-derived cells using the PP2 inhibitor, which down-regulates the hyperactivity of Src proteins, increased migration of these CD45KO cells to a gradient of SDF-1 (Fig. 3 H). These results ultimately demonstrate the link between CD45, Src kinase activity, and the regulation of motility properties.

teoclasts was observed in the CD45KO bones (unpublished data). We next tested progenitor cell levels in response to RANKL stimulations for 3 and 5 d. Immature WT progenitors and primitive SKL cells (Fig. 4, A and B, respectively) were expanded in the BM in response to RANKL stimulation, which was contrary to CD45KO cells. Levels of progenitors in the periphery of WT mice, such as the spleen (Fig. 4 C) or PB (Fig. 4 D), were increased, indicating progenitor mobilization. In contrast, CD45KO progenitors were not mobilized by RANKL stimulation for 3 d, and only at moderate levels after 5 d. Next, deeper investigations concerning the degradation of niche components were taken. We found only minor accumulation of soluble SCF in the PB of CD45KO mice in contrast to their WT counterparts (Fig. 4 E). Close examination of the trabecular endosteum, enriched with stem cell niches, demonstrated that in comparison to the WT BM, the niche component osteopontin was poorly degraded in CD45KO bone-lining osteoblasts after RANKL administration for both 3 and 5 d (Fig. 4 F). A broader examination of the entire BM showed a clear osteopontin-degraded product in the fluids of the WT BM after both 3 and 5 d of RANKL treatment (Fig. 4 G). However, degradation products were below the detection levels in CD45KO BM fluids, suggesting impaired osteopontin degradation (Fig. 4 G). These results indicate possible defects in CD45KO osteoclasts, resulting in their impaired response to RANKL and poor release of immature cells from the BM.
Abnormal development and maturation of CD45KO osteoclasts We continued by investigating the involvement of CD45 in osteoclast development and function. First, we confirmed that mature multinucleated osteoclasts derived from the BM of WT mice express CD45 (Fig. 5 A, top left), whereas, as expected, CD45KO osteoclasts did not express this molecule (Fig. 5 A, bottom left). Next, we observed that CD45KO osteoclasts cultured and developed in vitro demonstrated abnormal morphology (Fig. 5 B). Appearance of the phosphatase TRAP indicates the maturation status and functional stage of boneresorbing osteoclasts. TRAP staining of CD45KO osteoclasts grown in vitro showed their inability to acquire the flattened, spread morphology and assemble the typical sealing zone that can be seen as a purple ring in the perimeter of WT osteoclasts. In addition, these CD45KO osteoclasts appeared smaller, with a reduced ability to form multinucleated cells. Transcriptional assessment of DC-STAMP mRNA expression revealed that CD45KO BM cells exhibited reduced expression of this receptor (Fig. 5, C and D), which may lead to defects in cell fusion and maturation. We tested additional factors involved in osteoclast development and function, and examined expression of MMP-9 and MT1-MMP expressed by CD45KO osteoclasts. Notably, these cells secreted lower amounts of MMP-9 compared with their WT counterparts (Fig. 5 E), implying reduced osteoclast motility and activity. Moreover, G-CSF, which was shown to activate osteoclast development (30), induced up-regulation of MT1-MMP in WT osteoclasts, whereas expression of this enzyme in CD45KO osteoclasts

remained low, as in the steady state (Fig. 5 F). CD45 deficiency is associated with hyperphosphorylation and activation of its substrate, Src, leading to impaired cell movement (Fig. 3). We therefore assessed osteoclast development in the presence of the Src inhibitor PP2. Src inhibition impaired the development and organization of WT osteoclasts (Fig. 5 G, top), resembling the Src/ phenotype (31). Conversely, PP2 treatment restored the normal morphology and sealing zone as-

sembly of CD45KO osteoclasts (Fig. 5 G, bottom). Src activity assay confirmed that treating CD45KO osteoclast precursors with PP2 reduced their hyperactive Src to levels equivalent to WT cells (Fig. 5 H), enabling the formation of CD45KO osteoclasts exhibiting a normal phenotype. These results suggest that the expression and function of CD45 and its downstream target Src in monocyte-derived osteoclasts are required for the regulation of normal osteoclast development.

Abnormal bone microenvironment and defective hematopoiesis caused by reduced osteoclast function in CD45KO mice The reduced response of CD45KO mice to RANKL stimulations further suggested a defective function of CD45KO osteoclasts after their activation. Accumulation of pyridinoline (PYD) in the mouse plasma reflects an ongoing bone resorption process as a result of osteoclast function. We found lower

levels of PYD in the plasma of CD45KO mice, indicating impaired osteoclast resorbing activity (Fig. 6 A). In addition, we tested the levels of plasma osteocalcin as a marker for bone turnover. CD45KO mice demonstrated reduced amounts of osteocalcin in the plasma in comparison to their WT controls (Fig. 6 B). Hence, these findings suggested that bone-remodeling processes are impaired in CD45KO mice, resembling mild osteopetrosis. A three-dimensional CT scanning

of WT and CD45KO mice femurs was applied to analyze the trabecular and cortical microarchitecture. Based on a previous paper showing preferred localization of stem cells close to the bone edge (32), two regions of interest were determined: the first included 2 mm from the distal metaphysis (region 1), and the second was 1 mm ahead toward the diaphysis (region 2). Various bone morphometric and steorologic parameters, including bone volume and bone mineral mass; trabecular volume, trabecular number (Tb.N), and trabecular thickness; and the gaps between the trabecules were measured. The most prominent difference was the distribution of femoral trabecules. In WT mice, most of the femoral trabecules were found near the growing plates of the bone edge, in region 1 (Fig. 6 C, red frame). However, an abnormal pattern of trabecular

distribution was observed in the femurs of CD45KO mice, demonstrating a substantially higher number of trabecules in region 2 (Fig. 6 C, yellow frame). Accordingly, stereological analyses of CD45KO bones showed lower Tb.Ns at region 1 (red frame, 75  1.5%) and higher numbers at region 2 (yellow frame, 122  11%) compared with the femurs of WT mice. Interestingly, in vivo TRAP staining of bone sections demonstrated higher numbers of CD45KO TRAP+ cells along the trabecular endosteum, in comparison to their WT counterparts (Fig. 6 D). Similarly, a significantly larger portion of the CD45KO bone surface was covered with TRAP+ cells (Fig. 6 E), apparently compensating for their impaired function, as previously suggested in other osteoclast-defective models (18, 33). Of note, previous studies showed that osteopetrosis

and other defects associated with changes in the architecture of the bone are accompanied by alterations in the hematopoietic stem cell pool size and location (33, 34). We therefore anticipated that the abnormal bone microenvironment in CD45KO mice is related to altered hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell retention. Despite the regular cellularity of mature BM leukocytes and normal differential counts of circulating mature cells (Fig. 1 E), we identified lower numbers of immature Lin/c-Kit+ cells (Fig. 6 F) and the primitive SKL subset (Fig. 6, G and H) in the BM of CD45KO mice. Notably, significantly higher numbers of these undifferentiated cell populations were documented in the spleens of CD45KO mice in comparison to their WT counterparts (Fig. 6 I). Yet, despite their increased levels, CD45KO spleenderived progenitors showed inferior homing and repopulation potentials (Fig. 2 I).
Mutual defects in the CD45KO BM environment and hematopoietic cells in response to rapid mobilization Our results suggested that both environmental and cell-intrinsic defects can account for the impaired progenitor mobilization in CD45KO mice. To directly dissect these options, we established two sets of chimera models in which CD45KO mice were tested either as recipients or donors compared with WT mice. In the first set of experiments, WT and CD45KO mice were used as recipients for WT donor cells. In this setting, we observed lower engraftment levels of WT donor cells in CD45KO recipients compared with WT recipients (Fig. 7 A). This suggested an impaired ability of the CD45KO BM environment to support stem cell maintenance. Next, we studied rapid mobilization by injecting the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100, which was shown to induce mobilization without mediating cell expansion in the BM. Our results showed that after AMD3100 administration, WT (normal) donor cells have impaired mobilization in CD45KO compared with WT hosts (Fig. 7 B). These findings demonstrated that the CD45KO BM environment failed to facilitate normal mobilization. In the second set of experiments, high cell doses of WT and CD45KO cells were used as donor cells to repopulate WT recipients. In this set the mobilization potential of CD45KO cells in a normal environment was further assessed. In highly engrafted mice, AMD3100 stimulation resulted in only a minor cell mobilization when CD45KO cells served as donors, compared with their WT counterparts, although their BM environment was normal (Fig. 7 C). These experiments suggested that CD45 deficiency results in multiple defects, combining both cell autonomous and environmental mechanisms.
DISCUSSION In this study, we identified important roles for the panleukocyte CD45 in key processes of immature hematopoietic cell function: its BM retention and release to the periphery, processes that are dramatically affected by stress conditions. By using the CD45KO mouse model, we investigated two major parameters involved in progenitor motility and location, including intrinsic properties and environmental regulation.
2390

First, we revealed autonomous defects in CD45KO cell motility into and out of the BM compartment, including reduced mobilization and homing of mature leukocytes and immature progenitor cell populations derived from different organs. We suggest that CD45 regulates two cellular processes that have key roles in the migration and retention of leukocytes in general,

and progenitors in particular: proteolytic enzyme secretion and adhesion interactions. Lower secretion of MMP-9 by CD45KO BM MNCs after G-CSF stimulation implies that CD45 regulates MMP activation, and may thus further explain the reduced egress of CD45KO leukocytes. Corroborating our findings, mouse multiple myeloma CD45KO cells also secrete lower levels of MMP-9, correlating with their reduced invasive capacities compared with CD45+ cells (35).
BM-derived cells lacking CD45 have increased activation of 1 integrins and hyperinduction of adhesion properties, demonstrating that CD45 is a negative regulator of signaling cascades, inducing cell detachment and release. We found that Src kinase, the CD45 substrate, is a potential target by which CD45 regulates the migration of hematopoietic cells. Indeed, Src kinase inhibition enhanced CD45KO cell motility, demonstrating that Src activity is unbalanced in these cells. Several studies support the involvement of Src kinases in adhesion and motility properties. Src kinases were shown to regulate 1 and 2 integrins in different cells and cell lines (28, 36). Moreover, in mice deficient in members of the Src family, immature, hematopoietic Sca-1+ cells demonstrated increased homing (37), and primitive, BM-derived SKL cells showed enhanced GCSF-induced mobilization that was associated with elevated MMP-9 and accelerated breakdown of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (38). In line with these studies, our results demonstrate the opposite effects when Src is hyperactive because of CD45 deficiency. Still, such fundamental defects in the motility of both CD45KO progenitors and maturing leukocytes strongly suggest that additional pathways are also imbalanced by the lack of CD45 function. This is especially apparent in the defective cell polarization in response to chemotactic signals of CD45KO c-Kit+ progenitors. Moreover, SDF-1 is considered as a survival factor for stem and progenitor cells (39). Thus, the impaired ability of immature CD45KO c-Kit+ cells to normally respond to SDF-1 stimulation may further explain their inferior retention in the BM.
Previously, we suggested that interactions between hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with their BM microenvironment are mutual (5, 11). We further reveal that CD45 also plays a role in progenitor mobilization by regulating components of the BM microenvironment. Reduced progenitor expansion and release in response to RANKL activation in CD45KO mice was associated with impaired modulation of the stem cell niche regulating components osteopontin and SCF. Osteopontin was shown to negatively regulate and limit the number of endosteal stem cells (40, 41). The impaired degradation of osteopontin in the endosteum of RANKL-treated CD45KO mice may explain the low numbers and reduced expansion of progenitors and stem cells in their BM. In addition, it was previously shown that shedding of membrane-bound SCF by MMP-9 shifts stem cells from a quiescent to a proliferative state, enabling their release from the BM (9). The impaired resorption activity and the low secretion of MMP-9 by CD45KO osteoclasts may also contribute to the reduced progenitor expansion in the CD45KO BM, a prerequisite step for immature cell mobilization.

Osteoclasts derived from hematopoietic precursors in the BM of CD45KO mice show abnormal morphology and function both in vitro and in vivo, reflecting mild osteopetrosis. Of note, osteoclasts derived from precursors in the spleen exhibited the same defective phenotype (unpublished data), although the numbers of hematopoietic progenitors were higher in the CD45KO spleens. This demonstrates that the decreased osteoclast numbers are not caused by the lack of progenitor cells but rather an intrinsic defect in osteoclast differentiation. Our investigations further showed that CD45 regulates osteoclast formation via controlling Src kinase activity and DCSTAMP expression. In support of our findings, previous reports showed that osteoclasts derived from DC-STAMP/ mice were TRAP+ MNCs exhibiting a reduced bone-resorbing activity (17). Interestingly, DC-STAMP/ osteoclasts demonstrated enhanced Src expression, suggesting a link between these two regulators (17). Thus, our data propose a role for the CD45-Src axis in osteoclast fusion and maturation. In addition, low expression of MMPs in CD45KO osteoclasts showed that by regulating MMP-9 and MT1-MMP expression, CD45 is eventually involved in osteoclast motility and bone degradation activity (42, 43). These defects in osteoclasts may thus explain the poor mobilization observed in CD45KO mice. However, distinguishing between the environmental versus hematopoietic effects using chimera models revealed a parallel and perhaps additive impact of both compartments on progenitor retention and mobilization potentials.
The abnormal phenotype and activity of CD45KO osteoclasts are associated with lower numbers of trabecules in the femoral metaphysis, a region known to harbor stem cells (32). Mouse models of severe osteopetrosis exhibit extramedular hematopoiesis, demonstrating lower levels of stem and progenitors cells in the BM caused by several bone structure defects, and higher levels of progenitor cells in the spleen (33, 44). CD45KO mice demonstrated a similar phenotype of the primitive SKL pool size and location driven by multiple defects of both the CD45KO primitive cells and their osteoclast progeny. The reduction in CD45KO primitive cells in the BM is complementary to previous findings showing that Lyn/ mice (members of the Src kinase family) display higher numbers of primitive SKL cells in the BM (45), demonstrating the central role of the CD45-Src cascade in stem cell retention. Our findings indicate that stem and progenitor cells can modulate their CD45 expression and signaling via Src kinase, influencing their retention, survival, and motility. Moreover, CD45KO spleen progenitors, which are not directly influenced by osteoclasts, exhibited poor mobility and repopulation potentials, and an unusual distribution of these progenitors was observed between the spleen and the PB. However, previous studies showed that in normal settings, spleen progenitors reside in equilibrium with the blood, suggesting no barrier between these organs (46), as opposed to the BM (6, 46). Hence, progenitor accumulation in the spleen may also be affected by the impaired intrinsic ability of CD45KO spleen progenitors to traffic to the circulation. Additional factors may also be involved, including increased survival and/or proliferation of these progenitor cells in extramedullary locations such as the spleen.

Our results suggest that hematopoietic stem cells and their leukocyte progeny have dual CD45-mediated self-regulation modes: their motility, proliferation, and adhesion are autonomously and dynamically regulated. In addition to stem cell regulation by the niche, functional CD45 is needed for osteoclast development and activity, which indirectly affect hematopoiesis and the progenitor pool size via interactions with the bone and BM stromal cells. This notion of a dynamic cross talk between all components of the system is also supported by a recent study, which shows that primitive signaling lymphocyte activation molecule stem and progenitor cells can directly regulate osteoblast development (47). Collectively, our results reveal that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are involved in regulating their own levels and the dynamic BM microenvironment via their osteoclast progeny, which require modulated CD45 activity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice. All experiments were approved by the animal care committee of the Weizmann Institute. The experiments were performed on CD45 exon 6- deficient mice (provided by T. Mak, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada), which were bred and maintained under defined flora conditions at the Weizmann Institute. Age- and sex-matched C57BL/6 (CD45.2) mice (Harlan) were used as a WT control. All mice used were 6-8 wk of age at the onset of the experiments.
Stress-induced mobilization. Mice received a daily s.c. injection of 300 g/kg G-CSF (Filgrastim; Roche) for 3 or 5 consecutive days and were killed 4-6 h after the last injection. Single injections of 12.5 mg/kg LPS (Escherichia coli serotype O111:B4; Sigma-Aldrich) were administrated i.p. Mice were killed 16 h after injection. 2 g of mouse RANKL (R&D Systems) was injected into 5-6-wk-old WT and CD45KO mice, s.c. over the femur, twice a day for the first 3 d followed by 2 d of rest, or for 5 consecutive days.
Homing assay. 5  106 mouse BM MNCs per mouse, or 2.5  106 CD11b+ or c-Kit+ sorted cells per mouse, were prelabeled with CFSE dye (5 M/107 cells; Invitrogen) and i.v. injected into NOD/SCID mice. Recipient mice were killed after 3 h, and the number of CFSE+ cells that reached the BM and spleens of recipient mice was determined by FACS. The homing of progenitor cells was examined as previously described (48) and modified using spleen cells by injecting 20  106 total spleen cells into lethally irradiated (600 cGy from a cesium source) NOD/SCID/2/ mice. A fraction of the injected cells was plated in colony assays to quantify the number of injected CFU-Cs. Recipients were killed 18 h after injections, and fractions of BM and spleen (1-2  106 cells) were plated in methylcellulose medium to find the numbers of functional CFU-Cs (progenitors) that lodged to these organs. Homing efficiency was calculated as the percentage of homed progenitors out of the number of injected CFU-Cs in total spleen or four bones.
Repopulation and rapid mobilization in chimera models. Recipient C57BL/6 (CD45.2) or CD45KO (CD45.2) mice were irradiated (600 cGy from a cesium source) and injected 4 h later with 106 total BM cells derived from B6.SJL donors (CD45.1). Alternatively, C57BL/6 recipients were transplanted with 1-10  106 CD45KO BM or 106 spleen-derived cells from B6.SJL or CD45KO mice. PBS (as a control) or 5 mg/kg AMD3100 (Sigma-Aldrich) was injected s.c into chimeric mice 5 wk after transplantation. Engraftment levels and mobilization of donor WBCs in the PB were evaluated 1 h after AMD3100 injections using different combinations of cell staining and were analyzed by FACS. B6.SJL cells in different hosts were detected by tracing CD45.1+ cells, followed by staining with anti-CD45.1PE/CD45.2-FITC (eBioscience). Detection of CD45KO cells in C57BL/6 hosts was performed by staining with Lineage+/CD45.2 antibodies (eBioscience), evaluating donor cells as CD19+, CD11b+, and Gr1+, which are

CD45 cells. Mobilization index refers to the ratio between BM engraftment level and the amount of donor-derived cells in the circulation.
Colony-forming assay. PB samples were subjected to Ficoll separation. Total BM and spleen cells or PB MNCs were seeded (1.5  104, 5  105, and 2  105 cells/ml, respectively) in semisolid cultures, as previously described (15). Colonies were scored 7 d later under an inverted microscope (CK2; Olympus), applying morphological criteria.
Flow cytometry analysis. Membrane expression of different molecules on mouse BM and PB MNCs was detected by flow cytometry, using oneor two-step staining procedures. CD45 expression was assessed with FITC anti-mouse CD45.2 (BD Biosciences). CD45 expression on lineage-specific populations was determined by double staining using anti-CD45-PE (BD Biosciences) and antibodies for lineage markers (CD4- and CD11bFITC, and c-Kit-allophycocyanin; eBioscience). The percentage of SKL cells in the BM and PB was tested by staining MNCs, as previously described (16). Activated mouse 1 was detected by using anti-CD29 (clone 9EG7; BD Biosciences) and secondary PE-donkey anti-rat (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After staining, cells were washed and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) using CellQuest software.
Sorting for CD11b+ and c-Kit+ cells. Total BM cells from untreated mice or mice treated with G-CSF for 5 d were stained using anti-CD11bFITC and anti-c-Kit-APC. Cells were sorted to these two populations simultaneously using a FACSAria (Becton Dickinson). Cells were washed and tested applying in vitro and in vivo assays.
Migration assay. Chemotaxis assays were performed in Costar transwells (6.5-mm diameter, 5-m pore size; Corning). Upper filters were untreated (bare) or precoated overnight with 25 g/ml FN at 4캜 (Millipore). 105 mouse BM MNCs were added to the upper filters and were allowed to migrate toward 50 ng/ml SDF-1 (PeproTech) for 2 h. Migrating cells were counted using a FACSCalibur. CD45KO BM MNCs were pretreated with 1 M of the Src inhibitor PP2 (EMD), or as a control with the PP2 solvent DMSO for 30 min at 37캜. The cells were then washed and submitted to migration toward 50 ng/ml SDF-1 and analyzed as described.
Cell polarization microscopy images. Response to 200 ng/ml SDF-1 of c-Kit+-sorted cells was observed using a 40 objective (NA = 1.35; Olympus) on uncoated  slides (Integrated BioDiagnostics). Phase-contrast images were acquired using scientific-grade charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (LIS-700; Applitech) and processed by the DeltaVisionRT system using SoftWoRx software (Applied Precision).
Adhesion assay. 96-well plates were coated by overnight incubation with 25 g/ml FN at 4캜, washed with PBS, and blocked with 0.1% BSA. 2.5  105 WT or CD45KO BM MNCs per well were allowed to adhere to the plates for 16 h at 37캜 in serum-free RPMI 1640. Nonadherent cells were washed twice in PBS. Adherent cells were collected in 200 l PBS buffer plus 0.5 mM EDTA. The number of adherent cells was determined by FACS analysis using a FACSCalibur.
MMP-9 zymography. Zymography assay was performed as previously described (4), with the following modifications. BM and PB MNCs were incubated in vitro at 37캜 (105 cells per 100 l of serum-free RPMI 1640) for 40 h. For measurement of osteoclast-secreted MMP-9, total BM cells were cultured with M-CSF and RANKL, as previously described (16). The resulting conditioned medium was collected and loaded (10 l) on 10% SDS-PAGE gels containing 1 mg/ml gelatin.
Immunoblotting. Whole-cell lysates were prepared from BM MNCs of WT or CD45KO mice, intact or after G-CSF injections for 3-5 d. Lysates were obtained by a 15-min incubation with modified RIPA buffer (20 mM Hepes [pH 7.3], 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100,

2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mM GP, and 50 mM NaF) freshly supplemented with 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (SigmaAldrich) and 0.2 mM pervanadate (Sigma-Aldrich). 50 g of total protein was separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with TBST (5 mM Tris, 154 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20 [pH 7.6]) containing 5% milk and probed with rabbit anti-human/ mouse phospho-Src (Invitrogen), rabbit anti-human/mouse ERK1 (pThr202/ pTyr204) and ERK2 (pThr185/pTyr187; Sigma-Aldrich), or rabbit anti-total ERK1/2 (Sigma-Aldrich), as a control for total protein. Osteopontin expression was evaluated in BM superannuates, separated on 10% SDS-PAGE (20 g). Polyclonal anti-mouse osteopontin antibodies (R&D Systems) were used to detect the 32-kD degraded product, as previously described (49).
Src activity assay. Whole-cell lysates were prepared from BM MNCs and sorted CD11b+ cells. Alternatively, lysates were prepared from osteoclast precursors grown for 5 d in the presence of RANKL and 20 ng/ml M-CSF supplemented with 1 M PP2 or DMSO vehicle. Lysis was performed using HNTG lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X100, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 50 mM NaF) freshly supplemented with 1% protease inhibitor cocktail, 0.2 mM pervanadate, and 0.5 mM okadaic acid (A.G. Scientific). Src kinases were immunoprecipitated by incubating cell lysates with 1 g of anti-v-Src antibodies (EMD) for 2 h at 4캜. Protein G plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were added to the mixture and incubated for an additional 12 h at 4캜. Immunocomplexes were precipitated after three washes with HNTG wash buffer (20 mM Hepes [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 50 mM GP, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) and a final wash with Src kinase buffer (20 mM MOPS, 5 mM MgCl2). Src kinase activity was tested using a tyrosine kinase activity assay kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Src activity in BM samples was calculated in correlation to the total amount of Src that was precipitated in each sample stated by immunoblot assay.
CT imaging and trabecular morphometry. Femurs from CD45KO and WT control mice were removed, disarticulated from the pelvic bone and tibia, cleaned of soft tissues, and stored at 20캜. After thawing at room temperature, bones were scanned using a CT device (eXplore Locus SP; General Electric) with custom software (version 5.2.2; MicroView). Scanning was performed with 80-kV x-ray voltage, 80-A current, 400ms integration time, and 8-m pixel size. Based on preliminary work, two volumes of interest (VOI) were defined (Fig. 6 C). The first VOI consisted of the distal metaphyseal region, defined as starting at a distance of 32 image slices (250 m) from the growth plate in the direction of the diaphysis, and extending a further 220 slices (1.75 mm) in the same direction. The second proximal metaphyseal VOI started from the end of the previous VOI and extended a further 125 slices (1 mm) in the same direction. The trabecular volume was separated from the surrounding cortical shell by manual segmentation, and a direct three-dimensional model (50) was used to evaluate the Tb.N.
Osteoclast immunocytochemical staining. Total BM cells were seeded on glass cover-slips (106 cells/1 ml) and cultured for 6 d in -MEM supplemented with 20 ng/ml M-CSF (PeproTech) and RANKL that were changed every other day. Where indicated in the figures, culture medium was supplemented with 200 ng/ml G-CSF (Filgrastim; Roche). Samples were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (Merck), permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (SigmaAldrich), and immunolabeled at room temperature in a humidified chamber with FITC-conjugated anti-CD45.2 (eBioscience) or rabbit anti-mouse/human MT1-MMP polyclonal antibody (Millipore), followed by secondary goat anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor 488. TRITC-phalloidin and DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) were added. Images were acquired using scientific-grade CCD camera and processed by the DeltaVisionRT system using SoftWoRx software.
TRAP staining of bone sections and osteoclasts. TRAP staining of bone sections and osteoclasts was performed as previously described (16).
JEM VOL. 205, September 29, 2008

For osteoclast formation in vitro, BM cells were seeded in 96-well plates (105 cells/0.2 ml) and cultured with M-CSF and RANKL, as previously described (16). In some experiments, the culture medium was supplemented with 1 M of the Src inhibitor PP2 or its vehicle DMSO in the respective concentration.
Immunohistochemistry of osteopontin and SDF-1. Bone sections were prepared and stained as previously described (16).
ELISA for mouse SCF. Blood plasma samples were obtained from control and RANKL-treated mice and tested for SCF by ELISA, as previously described (16).
ELISA for PYD and osteocalcin. We tested plasma PYD (Metra; Quidel Corp.) and osteocalcin (Biomedical Technologies, Inc.) on frozen plasma samples according to the manufacturers' instructions.
Semiquantitative RT-PCR for DC-STAMP. We prepared cDNA from mouse BM cells using standard protocols. We performed semiquantitative PCR analysis for DC-STAMP expression for 35 cycles: 95캜 for 1 min, 60캜 for 1 min, and 72캜 for 1 min. We used the following primer sequences: 5-GGGTCTCAACACCACGAACT-3 and 5-GACTCTGTTTGCCCAGCTTC-3 (251 bp).
Statistical analysis. Significance levels of the data were determined by the Student's t test using Microsoft Excel.

Abstract
Background and Aim: Ulcerative colitis (UC) patients have several extraintestinal and systemic manifestations. As studies on the frequency and predictors of pulmonary involvement in patients with UC are inconsistent, we undertook this prospective study. Methods: Eighty-seven patients with UC (in remission 49, 56.3%, active disease 38, 43.6%, median age: 40 years, range: 16-66, 55, 62.2% males) and 50 healthy controls (median age: 38 years, range: 14-69, 34, 68% males) underwent pulmonary function tests (PFTs) including forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), Tiffeneau value (FEV1/FVC), mid-expiratory flow rate, and diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide with spirometer. Results: Subjects with UC and control were comparable in age and gender. PFT was abnormal in 24 (27.5%) patients (active disease 15/38, 39.4%, remission 9/49, 18.4%) and 1 (2%) control (P < 0.005). Of the 24 patients with abnormal PFT, small airway, restrictive, and obstructive defects were detected in 12 (50%), 11 (45.8%), and 1 (4.2%) patients, respectively. Patients with abnormal PFT more often had active disease (15/24, 62.5% vs 23/63, 36.5%; P = 0.03). No relation of PFT abnormalities was found with age, sex, duration of disease, body mass index, serum albumin, and hemoglobin levels, and other extraintestinal manifestation (arthritis/arthralgia) and drugs used to treat UC. Conclusion: UC patients with active disease have abnormal pulmonary functions with predominant involvement of small airways. Active UC was more often associated with abnormal PFT than the disease in remission.

Introduction
Lung involvement in ulcerative colitis (UC), first reported in 1976,1 has been increasingly reported in recent years. Since its first report, abnormal pulmonary function tests (PFTs) have been reported in 17-55% patients with UC,2-6 including a decrease in
gas transfer factor (diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide [DLCO]),7,8 elevated functional residual capacity (FRC),9 decrease in maximal mid-expiratory flow rate (MEFR),10 or an increased frequency of bronchial hyperresponsiveness11; however, in some studies, no abnormalities in PFT were found.10,12
Various respiratory abnormalities reported in patients with UC include obstructive and interstitial lung disease,13 small and large airway disorders,14,15 increase in bronchial sensitivity,11 bronchitis, bronchiectasis,16,17 and bronchiolitis oblitrans.18 Thus, it is
important that respiratory manifestations are recognized and trea-
ted early. Otherwise, these may lead to irreversible changes in
the airway wall or the end-stage lung disease.
However, information about the types of respiratory dysfunction, their relation with disease activity, and factors influencing pulmonary dysfunction in patients with UC is insufficient

and inconsistent. Also, little data are available from India regarding pulmonary function abnormalities in patients with UC.19-21
Accordingly, we undertook a study with the following aims: (i) to evaluate the frequency and type of pulmonary dysfunction in patients with UC and (ii) to evaluate the predictors of abnormal pulmonary functions.
Methods
Patients. Eighty-seven patients with UC (diagnosis based on characteristic clinical features, colonoscopy and histopathological examination of colonic mucosa, and exclusion of infective cause) attending the Gastroenterology outpatient of a multilevel teaching hospital in northern India were subjected to PFT after obtaining informed consent. Detailed clinical history including demographic profile, duration, disease severity, activity, and clinical course was recorded.
Patients with major surgical operation and skeletal abnormalities in the thorax, history of asthma or familial atopy, peripheral eosinophilia, previous lung disease, active smoking,

Pulmonary functions in ulcerative colitis

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), signs of pulmonary infection, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery and valvular heart diseases, morbid obesity (body mass index [BMI] > 35 kg/m2), pregnancy, age < 14 or >70 years, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and lack of compliance in performing PFT were excluded from the study.
Duration of disease. The duration of the disease was defined as the period between the date of onset of symptoms and the date of PFT.
Disease activity. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the activity of UC, one with active disease and the other in remission. Patients with active disease were classified as mild, moderate, or severe as per Truelove score.22 This score includes stool frequency, occurrence of blood in stools, fever, hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Patients were considered in clinical remission if they had one or two stools a day without blood, no fever, or tachycardia, along with normal Hb determinations and ESRs.23
Extent of disease. Extent of the disease was assessed on colonoscopy as proctitis, left-sided colitis, or pancolitis. Proctitis was defined as involvement of the rectum only, left-sided colitis as left colon up to splenic flexure and pancolitis as extensive disease beyond splenic flexure.
Healthy controls. A group of age- and sex-matched healthy controls was taken from the general population. PFT was done in all of them.
Ethical considerations. Written and informed consent was taken from all the patients and controls. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the institution.
Pulmonary function test. Pulmonary function testing were performed with spirometer (2010 Ganshorn, Medizin Electronic GmbH Industries, Trasse 6-8, 97618, Nieder Lauer, Germany. Software version LF 8.5) to measure the predicted forced vital capacity (FVC), the predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and their ratio (FEV1/FVC) as well as mean expiratory volume 25-75 (MEV25-75). A minimum of three acceptable and reproducible maneuvers were obtained, according to standard recommended by American Thoracic Society. Results were expressed as percentage of normal for gender, age, and height (percent predicted). DLCO was measured by single breath test24 (2010 Ganshorn, Medizin Electronic GmbH Industries, Trasse 68, 97618. Software version LF 8).
The individual results were classified as normal, restrictive, obstructive, or small airway disease as per the American Thoracic Society guidelines for PFT.25 Normal physiology was defined by all measurements being >80% predicted, a restrictive defect as a reduced (<80% predicted) FVC with an FEV1/FVC ratio of >70% predicted or reduced DLCO (<80% predicted), and an obstructive defect as a reduced FEV1 with a normal FVC and a low FEV1/FVC ratio (<70% predicted). Small airway disease was defined as reduced FEV1 (<70% predicted), low FEV1/ FVC (<70% predicted) ratio, and reduced MEF25-75 (<60% predicted).

Statistical analysis Sample size calculation. Assuming frequency of abnormal PFT among subjects with UC and healthy controls to be 20% and 4%, respectively, sample size was calculated considering 1.5 cases for every control with two-sided confidence interval of 95% and power of 80% with P-value of <0.05 as significant; number of cases and controls needed were 72 and 48, respectively. For calculation of sample size, EpiInfo software version 7 (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA) was used.
Data analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 15 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous data were expressed as median and range. Continuous and categorical variables were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U-test and chisquare test with Yates' correction as applicable, respectively. Intergroup comparison of more than two variables was performed using Kruskal-Wallis H-test. Spearman or Pearson correlation coefficient was used to find out the relationship between the two continuous variables depending on distribution of the data. P-values <0.05 were considered significant.
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics of UC patients and controls. Table 1 summarizes demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters of patients with UC (n = 87) and control (n = 50). Patients with UC and healthy controls were comparable in age (median: 40 years, range: 16-66 and median: 38 years, range: 14-69; P = 0.7) and gender (male 55, 63.2% and 34, 68%; P = 0.5). Duration of disease was 48 (range: 1-240) months. Forty-nine (58.6%) patients had active disease, 12 (arthralgia in 3 and arthritis in 9) had peripheral arthritis/ arthralgia as extraintestinal manifestation of UC. Three patients were ex-smokers and the others were non-smokers. All controls were non-smokers. None of our patients had an occupational or family history of respiratory disease, atopy, or had major abdominal or thoracic surgery. No patient had any significant abnormality on chest radiograph.
PFT in UC patients. Twenty-four (27.6%) UC patients but only 1 (2%) control showed abnormal PFT (P < 0.01). Of the 24 patients with abnormal PFT, small airway, restrictive, and obstructive defects were detected in 12 (50%), 11 (45.8%), and 1 (4.2%) patients, respectively. UC patients had significantly low FEV1, FEV1/FVC, MEF25-75, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and DLCO values compared with controls (P < 0.05) as shown in Table 1. PFT values were abnormal in 3 of 24 (12.5%), 15 of 42 (35.7), and 6 of 21 (28.6%) patients with proctitis, left-sided colitis, and pancolitis, respectively, as shown in Table 2. Of the 24 patients with abnormal PFT, 5 had symptoms (chronic cough in 3 and dyspnoea on exertion in 2).
Relationship between disease activity, extent of colitis, extraintestinal manifestations, treatment and nutrition status, and PFT. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters of UC patients with normal and abnormal PFT are shown in Table 2. In patients with abnormal PFT, 15 (62.5%) had active disease while 9 (37.5%) were in

remission (P < 0.03). Patients with proctitis tended more often to have normal than abnormal PFT (12.5% vs 33.3%; n = 0.06; Table 2). Nutritional status (BMI, serum albumin, and Hb) was not significantly different in patients with normal and abnormal PFT. Of the 87 patients with UC, 12 (13.8%) had peripheral joint arthralgia/arthritis. Frequency of abnormal PFT was comparable among patients with or without arthralgia/arthritis (4/24, 16.6% vs 8/55, 14.5%; P = ns). There was no relationship between treatment of UC with different drugs and abnormal PFT (Table 2).
UC patients with active disease and remission. Patients with active disease were comparable in age, gender, and duration of disease with patients in remission. There was no significant difference in FEV1, FEV1/FVC, MEF25-75, PEFR, and DLCO (P > 0.05) among patients with UC with active disease or in remission (Table 3), although different from controls (Fig. 1).
Discussion
In the present study, we found that (i) patients with UC more often had abnormal PFT in comparison to healthy controls,

(ii) patients with abnormal PFT more often had small airway involvement, and (iii) impairment of PFT was related to the activity of the disease.
Patients with UC are known to have several extraintestinal manifestations including pulmonary involvement. Douglas et al.26 found PFT abnormalities in 32% of patients with UC. However, most of the patients in their study were smokers. In our study, all participants were non-smokers or ex-smokers (3 out of 87) and thus any possible negative impact of smoking on PFT results was negligible. Sethy et al.19 and Tzanakis et al.14 also found deranged PFT in 17% (n = 85) and 27% (n = 51) patients with UC.
We found that UC patients had significantly lower DLCO as compared with controls. The reduction in DLCO may indicate an involvement of the lung parenchyma. This observation indicates that subclinical interstitial lung disease may be present in patients with UC as it is known that a reduction in the diffusing capacity of the lungs is a common and early manifestation of interstitial lung disease.27 The observed reduction in DLCO in our study might well be consistent with the presence of a subclinical alveolitis28 supporting the hypothesis of the migration of an inflammation via the bloodstream, from the intestine into both lung parenchyma and airway mucosa.29

mucosa, could explain the alteration in the small airways seen in
our study. Changes in the bronchial epithelium, consisting of
basal cell hyperplasia, basement membrane thickening, submucosal inflammation, and an overall increase in thickness of the epithelium, have been reported in bronchial biopsies from patients with UC and coexisting bronchial suppuration.30
All UC patients, whether active or in remission, had
abnormal PFT as compared with healthy subjects in our study.
Thus, it may suggest that patients, even after remission of UC,
may continue to have deranged PFT. Also, in our study, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, MEFR, and DLCO were significantly decreased in patients with active or inactive disease as compared with con-
trols. Patients with active disease had lower PEFR and DLCO than in inactive disease, although not statistically significant. Herrlinger et al.11 and Mohamed-Hussein13 also found that FEV1 and FVC significantly decreased in patients with active disease as compared to those with an inactive disease. In another study, Fehmi et al.15 found significantly decreased FEV1, FVC, and DLCO when PFT in the active and in remission phases in the
same patient was compared with control.
Among the patients with deranged PFT, 1 (4.2%) had
obstructive, 12 (50%) had small airway disease and 11 (45.8%) had a restrictive pattern of lung involvement. Sethy et al.21
reported restrictive pattern and small airway disease in 16% and 8% of UC patients (n = 51) with abnormal PFT. Godet et al.9
also found PFT abnormalities, obstructive pattern, abnormal
DLCO, and restrictive pattern in 53%, 22.7%, 28.8%, and 1.5%,
of patients with UC, respectively. In an Indian study of 27 of 95 (28.5%) patients with inflammatory bowel disease (83 UC

and 12 Crohn's disease), small airway obstruction was seen in 18, restrictive defect in 6, and mixed defect in 3 patients.31 Our results are somewhat in accordance with that study.31
A higher number of patients with disease limited to rectum had normal PFT (33.3% vs 12.5%; P = 0.06) in our study. This can be explained by higher chances of lung involvement by an inflammatory process as the extent of UC increases from rectum to the whole colon. Data on the relationship between the extent of UC and PFT abnormalities are scanty in the literature. Hence, more studies with higher number of patients are needed to know the influence of disease extent on pulmonary functions.
In contrast to our study that showed a lack of relationship between BMI and PFT results, Herrlinger et al. found weak correlation between inspiratory vital capacity (r = 0.25, P < 0.05) and BMI but not for FEV1 (r = 0.18, P < 0.89) and DLCO (r = 0.24, P < 0.20).3
Patients with severe disease activity may perform worse on PFT due to general sickness and fatigue. Apart from poor compliance in performing the tests being an exclusion criterion in our study, patients in remission without clinical symptoms performed significantly worse than healthy controls. This is a strong argument on the influence of the disease on pulmonary function and strengthens the hypothesis that the observed abnormalities in lung function tests represent a real extraintestinal manifestation of UC.
Limitation of our study is lack of high resolution CT scan of thorax in patients with abnormal PFT, which may have further characterized the respiratory abnormality. Also, long-term

follow-up of patients with abnormal PFT is required to know whether they develop clinically significant lung disease or endstage lung failure.
We conclude that about one-fourth of patients with UC have abnormal PFT. The impairment of pulmonary functions correlates with the activity of the disease. Pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical relevance need to be studied further.

J Int Oral Health 2015;7(Suppl 2):74-76. Abstract: The majority of foreign body ingestions occur in the pediatric population, with a peak incidence between the ages of 6 months and 6 years. Safety during dental treatment of children cannot be overemphasized. Uncooperative, mentally and physically handicapped children are more prone to ingestion or aspiration of dental instruments than other populations. In any event, it is recommended that dental practitioners examine their instrument before use, as a safeguard against any slippage, breakage. Treatment with any endodontic device requires the use of proper isolation such as rubber dam.
Key Words: Accidental ingestion, endoscopy, foreign body, gastrointestinal tract, rubber dam, swallowing
Introduction Endodontic treatment has a great advantage over-extraction. We can save many teeth by endodontic procedures rather than extraction, and it has been successful and conservative mode of treatment. However, sometimes mishaps such as accidental ingestion of the endodontic instrument may occur if the treatment is carried out without application of rubber dam, especially in the child patient. Such mishaps are rare but potentially very harmful to the patients and causes anxiety to the clinician.
When an accidental ingestion of an endodontic instrument occurs, endodontist should have a basic knowledge about the diagnostic procedure, complications, methods of retrieving the swallowed instrument, as well as the ability to reassure the patient.1

For the endodontic instruments, the prevalence for aspiration was 0.0009/100,000 root canal treatments and the prevalence for ingestion was 0.08/100,000 root canal treatments.2 The reason for the relatively low reported incidence, when endodontic equipment is involved, may be the use of rubber dam. Aspiration of foreign bodies during dental treatment is rare, however, when such accidents happen it is considered a major complication in terms of the treatment needed to avert this event, and the impact on the patient's health.
The present case report describes a rare case of swallowing of a hand pro taper file used for pulpectomy in 4 years old patient and also provides the knowledge about possible complications that may arise due to accidental swallowing of such instruments and their treatment modalities depending upon the location of the instrument either in gastrointestinal tract or respiratory tract.
Case Report A 4-year-old male patient reported to the department of pediatric and preventive dentistry, Annasaheb Chudaman Patil Memorial Dental College, Dhule with pain in his lower left back tooth. On radiographic examination, pulpectomy was planned for the tooth 74. On the same day, access opening was done with tooth 74 under local anesthesia, pulp was extirpated, working length was determined and bio-mechanical preparation was in progress when patient suddenly moved his head due to which endodontic instrument (size Sx Pro Taper hand file, Dentsply) slipped from operator's hand and patient swallowed it.
After this unfortunate event, pulpectomy procedure was immediately discontinued, and measures were taken to retrieve the file. The patient was kept in the prone position with the head at lower level than the limb, and 4-5 thrusts were given on his back expecting the expulsion of the instrument. However, it did not work. Hence, patient was immediately shifted to the Annasaheb Chudaman Patil Memorial Medical College, Dhule in emergency medicine department. There, a physician in charge advised him for the postero-anterior chest radiograph. A postero-anterior chest radiograph demonstrated the presence of sharp foreign object at the level L2-L3 (Figure 1), just below the shadow of the diaphragm. The clinical and radiographic assessment done and opinion sought from the pediatric surgeon, who advised to keep the patient under

observation as the radiographic findings were suggestive of presence of endodontic instrument in the gastrointestinal tract (stomach) and not in the respiratory tract and patient was free of any respiratory distress or coughing or sneezing. Clinically, smooth breathing sound was noticed and no tenderness or pain was present on palpation of the area in which foreign body was present.
High risk consent was obtained from the parents accompanying the child and patient was kept under high fibrous diet, and syrup chremaffin was prescribed for allowing the rapid transport of the instrument within the gastrointestinal tract. Patient was kept under close observation in the department of emergency medicine. All the vital statistics were obtained and regularly noted every 2 h. Serial radiographic examinations were performed to monitor the migration of the instrument. A repeated radiograph was taken of postero-anterior view of abdomen, 24 h after the ingestion of the instrument. This radiograph suggested the presence of the endodontic instrument in the caecum of the large intestine (Figure 2).
Finally, 41 h after the file ingestion, the file was found in the faeces, and confirmatory radiograph was obtained to make sure the absence of any foreign object in the gastrointestinal tract (Figures 3 and 4).
Three weeks later, pulpectomy was completed in the Department of Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry under the rubber dam isolation.

Figure 2: Chest radiograph showing movement of protaper file after 24 h of ingestion.
Figure 3: Chest radiograph after file was excreted. Discussion Ingestion of dental objects is more common than aspiration. Whenever a dentist loses a dental instrument, dental materials or any other foreign object inside oral cavity, he must consult a radiologist even if the patient has no complaints.

According to Hodges et al., mentally and physically handicapped children are more prone to ingestion or aspiration of dental instruments than other populations. In any event, they recommended that dental practitioners examine their instrument before use as a safeguard against any slippage, breakage.2 Treatment with any endodontic device requires the use of a rubber dam.
Surprisingly, in a survey by Whitworth et al. very few (<20%) of the surveyed dentists were using rubber dam routinely while the vast majority of them (60%) have reported never to use rubber dam while performing endodontic procedures.3
There are many possible symptoms of foreign body ingestion such as chest pain, acute dysphagia, vomiting, choking, drooling, blood stained saliva. Respiratory symptoms as wheezing, coughing, dyspnea may suggest that the foreign object has lodged in the upper gastrointestinal or respiratory tract. 90% of the ingested dental instrument passes out of body through gastrointestinal tract.
Endodontic files, which are used for root canal cleaning procedure, have been reported to pass through gastrointestinal system within 3 days, but 10% require endoscopic removal and only 1% will require surgical intervention.4
Patients with stomach or small-intestine foreign bodies of width <2 cm or length <6 cm can be discharged home with instructions on symptoms that should prompt their reattendance.5 If a foreign object found to be lodged in respiratory tract, bronchoscopy is a must.
Recommended management protocol For the sharp objects like endodontic file, when lodged in the gastrointestinal tract or respiratory tract, the management

protocol is endoscopic retrieval/bronchoscopy or the careful monitoring with periodic radiographs should be undertaken. If the object fails to progress after 72 h, or the signs of bleeding, perforation, obstruction are noticed, laparotomy should be carried out immediately.
Prevention of such mishaps in clinical practice All the endodontic procedure should be strictly carried out under rubber dam isolation. Rotary files are preferred over hand files for the endodontic treatment of the pediatric patient. If hand files are used, the floss should be tied to the handle of the files with the length of 18 inches or more for easy retrieval of the instrument. Dentist should always work in dry environment rather than in wet conditions to minimize the chances of slippage of the instrument.
Conclusion The accidental ingestion or aspiration of the dental instrument is the potential life-threatening complication. In such cases, "prevention is better than cure" is applicable. Rubber dam isolation should be strictly applied, and dentist should be aware of handling such situation by having the knowledge of diagnosis, immediate retrieval measures and providing emergency treatment to the patient.

Bilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty for Charcot Arthropathy After Cauda Equine Syndrome: A Case Report
Athanasios Karageorgosa, d, Andreas X. Papadopoulosa, Ioannis D. Gelalisb, Charalampos Matzaroglouc

Abstract
Charcot arthropathy of the knee is a relatively rare and poorly understood condition. Diagnosis requires detailed history of the patient, radiological investigation and exclusion of other causes of arthropathy. Conservative treatment is sufficient only in early stages. In late stages, either arthrodesis or total knee arthroplasty is the treatment of choice. We report a case of a 65-year-old woman who presented with Charcot arthropathy in both knees, after a spinal fracture 35 years ago, which caused cauda equine syndrome with diminished sensation of both legs. She underwent bilateral total knee arthroplasty using hinged knee prosthesis.

ory, neurally stimulated vascular reflexes may provoke bone resorption. In the first half of the 20th century syphilis was the main cause of Charcot arthropathy. As syphilis declined due to antibiotic evolution, diabetes mellitus became the primary etiology [4-6].
Diagnosis of Charcot arthropathy should include detailed history taking, and a complete physical examination, including neurologic tests. It is based on clinical findings such as warm and swollen painless joint and later radiographic evaluation, which may reveal joint dislocation, fractures, or deformities [7].

Case Report

Introduction
Charcot arthropathy is a relatively rare and poorly understood condition. It is a progressive degenerative disease of the joint that may lead to severe deformity and dysfunction. Bilateral knee neuropathic arthropathy is an exceedingly rare condition [1]. Given the rarity of Charcot arthropathy of the knee in general treatment is still controversial, with the trend nowadays toward total knee arthroplasty (TKA) [2].
Pathomechanism of the disease is still unknown. However, it is believed that the diminution or absence of nociception, results in poor joint protection and undetected microtrauma may lead to development of bone destruction and attenuation of ligaments [3]. Furthermore, according to neurovascular the-

A 65-year-old woman presented to the orthopaedic office on a wheelchair. The patient had suffered an O5 fracture 35 years ago which was treated conservatively, and produced a cauda equine syndrome. The symptoms of urinary incontinence, diminished sensation in both legs distally to the middle of both thighs and deep tendon reflexes were remaining. Furthermore, she presented with muscular weakness (2+/5) of both feet, and she used feet orthoses. The quadriceps strength was uneventful. The patient had no notable medical history concerning diabetes mellitus, syphilis, lacunar infarcts, rheumatologic disease and osteoarthritis, and she denied tobacco and alcohol use. She had suffered a right middle tibia fracture 5 years ago, which was treated with intramedullary nailing and fused uneventfully. After a period of 2 months she regained her prior walking ability and was able to walk using a walker. The last 2 years she gradually lost her walking ability due to gross instability of both knees.
The main complaints were progressively swollen knees with mild pain and increasingly instability with valgus deformity and crepitus for the last 2 years. Since then the patient was unable to weight bear due to gross instability, and she used a wheelchair. During her admission to the orthopaedic office both knees had similar clinical deterioration and radiological abnormalities. Gross abnormal mobility was present on clinical examination in both sagittal and coronal planes. Anterior and posterior drawer test were positive. Varus and valgus instability test were also positive.

Due to the progressive inability to ambulate the patient decided to be treated with total knee arthroplasty (TKA). She underwent removal of the intramedullary nail first. Two months later she was operated on her right knee using cemented rotating hinged knee prosthesis, in order to accommodate bone loss and ligamentous insufficiency. On postoperative day 2, the patient could partially weight bear. Wound healing was uneventful, and on postoperative day 20 knee range of motion (ROM) was 115/0/0 (flexion/extension/hyperextension). Knee stability was restored, and she was allowed to weight bear. Three months

later the patient underwent TKA at her left knee using identical technique. Postoperative course was uncomplicated, and on day 20, ROM was 120/0/0. Six weeks later she was able to walk with the aid of a walker and was satisfied with the result.
We assessed the clinical outcome using the Knee Society Score (KSS) [8], which was calculated preoperatively and at the final evaluation 12 years postoperatively. There was an improvement from 25 to 90 points in knee score and from 0 to 30 points in function score, although she was continued to use walker due to her muscular weakness of both feet. Radiological evaluation also took place at the final follow-up, using radiographs. The position of components was evaluated for proper placement and loosening, with no apparent sings of malposition and progressive loose lines (Fig. 3).
Discussion
Neuropathic arthropathy was described by Jean Martin Charcot in 1868 as the progressive destruction of bone and soft tissue in patients with peripheral neuropathy. Almost 100 years later, Eichenholtz stated that the knee was the most common site of neuroarthropathy, and all these patients had tabes dorsalis. Since then and due to antibiotic evolution, the incidence of neurosyphilis has been declining, with diabetes mellitus constituting the most common reason for neuroarthropathy of joints in the lower extremity [9]. Diabetic neuropathy most commonly involves the tarsal, tarsometatarsal and ankle joints [10]. Other causes are leprosy, meningomyelocele, syringomyelia and spinal cord injury [11, 12]. Our case is the only one in the literature that followed vertebral fracture and cauda equine

syndrome. The pathophysiology of Charcot arthropathy is not fully
understood. The current accepted theory states that in susceptible individuals with peripheral neuropathy, an unregulated inflammatory process is triggered which leads to an increase expression of the polypeptide receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-b ligand (RANKL). RANKL triggers the synthesis of nuclear transcription factor, nuclear factor- (NF-), and this in terms stimulates the maturation of osteoclasts from osteoclast precursor cells. Furthermore NF- stimulates the production of the glycopeptide osteoprotegerin (OPG) from osteoblasts. All these events lead to continuing local osteolysis. The damaged nervous endings may also decrease the secretion of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). This peptide works as an antagonist of the RANKL synthesis and at the same time is responsible for the normal integrity of the joint capsule [13].
The diagnosis is based on patient's history, clinical examination, and imaging methods. Risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, syphilis, leprosy, alcoholism, syringomyelia, lacunar infarcts etc., which can lead to loss of deep sensation and proprioception, should be identified.
Typical symptoms in clinical examination of active neuropathic arthropathy are edema, erythema, warmth, and more than 2 캜 difference in local temperature in comparison to the contralateral extremity. Pain occurs in about 50% of neuropathy cases [14]. Furthermore, the degree of pain does not correlate with the degree of joint destruction [7]. Differential diagnosis in acute stage of disease should be done especially between septic arthritis, osteomyelitis and microcrystalline arthritis. Our case presented with mild pain due to loss of sensitivity, despite the gross instability of both knees.
Radiograph is the preferred examination method concerning the imaging methods. The Eichenholtz classification [15] is still in use and it consists of three stages. Stage of development, which is an early stage of the disease, shows evidence of debris formation, fragmentation, disruption and dislocation of the articular margins. Stage of coalescence is characterized by absorption of much or all of the fine debris, sclerosis, and fusion of most large fragments. Finally, stage of reconstruction presents decrease sclerosis, rounding of major fragments, and some kind of reformation of joint architecture. Recently magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been broadly used to detect this condition early, as changes on X-ray are typically delayed and have low sensitivity [16]. Bone marrow edema as a finding in a patient with risk factors may depict neuropathic arthropathy in early stages.
The treatment of neuropathic arthropathy is conservative at the early stages of the disease prior to radiographic abnormalities. It is based on immobilization and complete absence of weight bearing for the affected extremity in the active stage. To support healing bisphosphonates, intranasal calcitonin [17] and teriparatide [18] have been used, but their efficacy is yet to be fully demonstrated. When the knee joint is affected, and radiological abnormalities are apparent, conservative treatment is insufficient [19]. Arthrodesis has been the mainstay of operative treatment in the late stages of neuroarthropathy, despite a high incidence of failure [20]. Knee arthroplasty has been considered to be an absolute contraindication because

of the high incidence of serious complications [21]. However in recent years some authors have shown satisfactory results after knee arthroplasty in patients with neuropathic arthropathy [21, 22]. High incidence of serious complications, such as periprosthetic infection, aseptic loosening, and periprosthetic fracture, in these patients are related to significant bone loss, poor bone quality and ligamentous laxity. Recommendations for successful total knee arthroplasty include bone grafting or custom-augmented prosthesis to repair bony defects, correct ligamentous balancing, total synovectomy, and a complete armamentarium of the new implants. Furthermore, a better outcome is obtained if implantation occurs after the initial developmental phase [23].
Conclusions
Late stage neuropathic arthropathy of the knee causes significant functional deficits, and its treatment is very challenging. There is still a lack of consensus regarding the optimal treatment when operative management is indicated. Although knee arthroplasty recently provides promising results, it is associated with high complication rates, is technically demanding, and needs a complete armamentarium of the new implants.

Report

Learning Point of the Article: Gaucher's disease may mimic a primary bone tumor or metastasis and one should have a high index of suspicion in patients with multiple osteolytic lesions without any significant past history amongst patients of non-Ashkenazi Jewish descent.

Abstract
Introduction: Gaucher's disease is a congenital lysosomal storage disorder caused by an autosomal recessive mutation in B-glucocerebrosidase. It is a multi-system disease, wherein patients present with hematological abnormalities, joint pain, osteonecrosis, and developmental delay. We present a case of 38-year-old male with a painless solitary soft-tissue swelling over the left proximal tibia, eventually diagnosed it to be a case of Gaucher's disease. This case is unique in the literature, because this subcutaneous Gaucher mass was not associated with a significant past history and was being evaluated as a standard approach to a bone tumor.
Case Presentation: A 38-year-old man presented to our outpatient department with a solitary, painless soft-tissue swelling of the left proximal tibia noticed 6 months back, which has gradually progressed to a present size of 9x5 cm over a period of 6 months. General physical examination revealed moderate splenomegaly. Radiographs showed an osteolytic lesion in the left proximal tibia without cortical erosion. Radiographs for skeletal survey revealed similar osteolytic lesions elsewhere. Hematological investigations revealed thrombocytopenia. A serum protein electrophoresis was found to be normal and the urine was negative for myeloma proteins. Blood workup for endocrine abnormalities was within normal limits. MRI of the lesion suggests bone infarct. Biopsy from the lesion showed a giant binucleate storage cell filled with glucocerebrosides suggestive of Gaucher's disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by elevated plasma levels of glucocerebrosidases.
Conclusion: Gaucher's disease is a rare metabolic disease of the bone which may mimic a primary bone tumor or metastasis. A step-wise meticulous approach with biopsy and elevated plasma levels of glucocerebrosidase helps establish the diagnosis. Once must have a high index of suspicion for Gaucher's disease in an adult with multiple osteolytic lesions without any significant past medical and surgical history.
Keywords: Gaucher's disease, lysosomal storage disease, autosomal recessive mutation, solitary musculoskeletal swelling, multiple osteolytic lesions, bone infarcts, soft-tissue mass, enzyme replacement therapy.

Introduction
At present, there are more than 45 lysosomal storage disorders, of which Gaucher's disease is the most prevalent in India and worldwide [1]. Gaucher's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, where the metabolic defect is due to an inherited deficiency of glucocerebrosidase caused by a mutation in the

GBA1 (acid--glucosidase) gene causing accumulation of an abnormal lipid glucocerebroside in the lysosome of macrophages, leading to a wide spectrum of phenotypic manifestations [2]. There is a striking variation in its clinical manifestations, severity and course of the disease with different bone involvements can be confused with hematological diseases,

infections, and malignancy. There are six different bony manifestations of Gaucher disease - bone marrow infiltration, avascular necrosis, bone crisis, pathological fractures, lytic lesions, and osteomyelitis [3]. We describe a case of Gaucher cell deposition in the subcutaneous soft-tissues overlying the proximal tibia mimicking neoplasm in an 38-year-old man without any significant past history.

Case Report
A 38-year-old patient presented to us with a painless solitary swelling, over left upper leg (Fig. 1) which was insidious in onset, gradually progressed over a period of 6 months to present size of 9 x 5 cm. No other associated symptoms. No history of swelling elsewhere in the body. Clinically, there was no local warmth, tenderness, or crepitus. It was firm in consistency and uniform throughout. The range of motion at the knee joint was normal and painless. Systemic examination revealed moderate splenomegaly. There were no palpable lymph nodes. Regional radiographs revealed a large lytic lesion with well-defined margins with narrow zone of transition without cortical breech or periosteal reaction in the metaphysio-diaphyseal region of left proximal tibia (Fig. 2). It was associated with diffuse osteopenia. Radiographs of skeletal survey revealed similar osteolytic lesions in both femur shaft, both proximal humerus and contralateral tibia (Fig. 3). There were no lytic lesions in the skull and the spine. Chest radiograph did not show any evidence of metastasis (Fig. 4). Laboratory investigations revealed

thrombocytopenia. Hemoglobin, total leucocyte count, differential leucocyte count, total protein, serum creatinine, blood urea, serum calcium, and potassium were within normal limits. ESR and CRP were normal. Serum electrophoresis study was within normal limits, and the urine was negative for myeloma protein. Regional MRI of tibia showed ill-defined serpiginous areas of heterogenous T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity involving left proximal tibia (Fig. 5). On postcontrast study, these areas show heterogenous enhancement. In the given clinical setting, the above findings were suggestive of bone infarcts. Cortical destruction and irregularity seen. Heterogenous T2 hyperintense and T1 hypointense subcutaneous collection was seen along the anterior aspect of the left tibia and seen communicating with marrow cavity through above-mentioned cortical defect. Finally, a biopsy was planned from the most representative part of the swelling. Four core samples were obtained using an 18-gauge biopsy device which showed confluent proliferation of well-demarcated giant binucleate storage cells bearing small, irregular nuclei, and fibrillary cytoplasm reminiscent of "wrinkled tissue paper" on hematoxylin and eosin staining filled with glucocerebrosides suggestive of Gaucher's disease (Fig. 6). The diagnosis was confirmed by elevated plasma levels of glucocerebrosidase. The treatment basically involves a multidisciplinary approach to address orthopedic manifestations, hematologic abnormalities and neurologic abnormalities in a few subset of patients. Enzyme replacement therapy is the crux of treatment in our

case. Following biopsy, the decision was made to follow this lesion clinically and to maintain the patient on the baseline level of enzyme therapy. Given the unique quality of this case, the anticipated natural course of this mass in the absence of additional treatment is not known. Further, evaluation with regular follow-up with imaging will be required if the mass undergoes any clinical changes.
Discussion Bony manifestations in Gaucher's disease are common, but extraosseous extension is unusual. Extraosseous Gaucher cell deposits are a rare feature of Gaucher's disease that can mimic malignancy [4]. The osseous manifestations of Gaucher's disease are the major determinants of morbidity and functional outcome in those affected [5]. Most cases of bone involvement with extraosseous extension have been described in type I Gaucher disease which is the most common type [6]. Type I disease accounts for more than 99% of Gaucher disease cases, which spares the central nervous system and is often diagnosed later in life. As such, its primary manifestations are often due to bone marrow replacement and ensuing hematopoietic effects or bony deformity or fracture [7]. Type II and III Gaucher disease are both characterized by neurologic involvement. Type III Gaucher's disease carries a less favorable prognosis and progresses more rapidly than type II. Types II and III are rare and do not demonstrate any ethnic

predilection, in contrast to the increased incidence of type I disease amongst patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent [8]. The medullary expansion is related to the replacement of the bone marrow by Gaucher cells manifesting as an enlargement of the bone shaft and cortical thinning. In rare instances, the expansion of the medullary cavity may lead to cortical destruction and may result in the extraosseous extension of Gaucher cell deposits mimicking malignancy [9]. In such instances, a meticulous step-wise examination helps in the establishment of the diagnosis and decreases the incidence of errors especially when there is not significant history suggestive of Gaucher's disease. An approach to a solitary musculoskeletal swelling should be followed. A biopsy should be done only after clinical and radiological diagnosis is established and biopsy is used to confirm the diagnosis rather than establishing the diagnosis as a shortcut [10]. Observation and supportive therapy is the mainstay in the absence of pathological fracture and disabling deformity. As the patient is highly prone for pathological fractures, fracture management requires preoperative optimization with enzyme therapy [11]. Availability of additional blood, clotting factors, and platelets due to increased bleeding risk and the anesthesiologist to maintain adequate oxygenation to avoid precipitating bone crisis [12]. There is also an increased risk of infection in such patients [13].
Conclusion
Gaucher's disease is a rare metabolic disease of the bone which may mimic a primary bone tumor or metastasis. It can be a rare cause of a solitary musculoskeletal swelling in an adult without any history suggestive of Gaucher's disease. A step-wise meticulous approach with general physical examination, radiology, hematology, and finally biopsy and elevated plasma levels of glucocerebrosidase helps establish the diagnosis. Once must have a high index of suspicion for Gaucher's disease in an adult with multiple osteolytic lesions without any significant medical and surgical history.
Clinical Message
Solitary musculoskeletal swelling requires a meticulous stepwise approach to arrive at a diagnosis. Gaucher's disease may mimic a primary bone tumor or metastasis and one should have a high index of suspicion in patients with multiple osteolytic lesions without any significant history amongst patients of non-Ashkenazi Jewish descent.

Characterization of Paroxysmal Gluten-Sensitive Dyskinesia in Border Terriers Using Serological Markers
M. Lowrie , O.A. Garden, M. Hadjivassiliou, D.S. Sanders, R. Powell, and L. Garosi
Background: Paroxysmal gluten-sensitive dyskinesia (PGSD) in border terriers (BTs) results from an immunologic response directed against transglutaminase (TG)2 and gliadin. Recent evidence suggests that PGSD is only one aspect of a range of possible manifestations of gluten sensitivity in the breed.
Hypothesis/Objectives: Gluten sensitivity in BTs is a heterogeneous disease process with a diverse clinical spectrum; to characterize the phenotype of PGSD using TG2 and gliadin autoantibodies as diagnostic markers.
Animals: One hundred twenty-eight client-owned BTs with various disorders. Methods: Prospective study. BTs with paroxysmal episodes and a normal interictal examination were phenotyped using footage of a representative episode and assigned to 3 groups: idiopathic epilepsy (IE), paroxysmal dyskinesia (PD), or other. Owners of each dog completed a questionnaire to obtain information regarding clinical signs. Healthy BTs formed a control group. Serum antibodies against TG2 and AGA were measured in all dogs. Results: One hundred twenty-eight BTs were enrolled; 45 with PD, 28 with IE, 35 with other conditions, and 20 controls. Three overlapping phenotypes were identified; PD, signs suggestive of gastrointestinal disease, and dermatopathy. AGA-IgG concentrations were increased in PD, compared with IE (P 5 0.012), controls (P < 0.0001) and other (P 5 0.018) conditions. Anti-canine TG2-IgA concentrations were increased in PD, compared with IE (P < 0.0001), controls (P < 0.0001) and other (P 5 0.012) conditions. Serological markers are highly specific for PGSD but lack sensitivity. Conclusions: PGSD appears part of a syndrome of gluten intolerance consisting of episodes of transient dyskinesia, signs suggestive of gastrointestinal disease, and dermatological hypersensitivity. Key words: Canine epileptoid cramping syndrome; Gluten-free diet; Movement disorder; Neurology.

C anine epileptoid cramping syndrome is a paroxysmal gluten-sensitive dyskinesia (PGSD) of border terriers (BTs) that is analogous to paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesias in people.1-3 PGSD is characterized by episodic combinations of dystonia, chorea, ballism, tremor, and athetosis occurring at rest with no loss of consciousness.2 Episodes begin between 6 weeks and 7 years of age. The episodes might last a few minutes up to a few hours, with some owners reporting an association with stress or excitement and others reporting signs during waking from sleep. One interesting feature is the association in around 50% of

dogs with signs suggestive of mild gastrointestinal involvement, such as vomiting, diarrhea or borborygmi,2 and a recent report suggests that PGSD is only one aspect of a range of possible manifestations of gluten sensitivity in the breed.4 Measurement of serum AGA IgG and anti-canine transglutaminase-2-IgA (TG2 IgA) was increased in 5 affected dogs, and a clinical and serological improvement was identified on institution of a gluten-free diet.3 A clinical diagnosis previously relied on exclusion of other causes for the paroxysmal episodes by recognition of the typical features of PGSD by observing a video recording of a representative episode2 and performing diagnostic testing to rule-out extracranial and intracranial structural disease. Stratification of individuals meant that diagnosis was limited to those with the typical signs of the disease. We speculated that there is more phenotypic heterogeneity within this condition than has been reported. Diagnostic biomarkers for PGSD have now been discovered, opening the way for more detailed studies of phenotype and underlying pathobiology.3
The discovery of this canine gluten sensitivity has implications for people. Sensitivity to gluten results in a systemic immune-mediated disease that can present with diverse

776

manifestations. Coeliac disease (CD) is triggered in genetically susceptible people by the ingestion of gluten.5 However, this term is reserved for those patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. The more recently coined term, non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), comprises a gamut of conditions in people, all of which are characterized by an immune response to the ingestion of gluten, but with diverse multi-organ manifestations6 including the gut, skin (dermatitis herpetiformis),7 and brain (gluten ataxia; GA).8
Our aim was to confirm the use of serum AGA IgG and TG2 IgA as a diagnostic test for PGSD. In this verification process, we aimed to identify and describe the broad spectrum of clinical signs resulting in PGSD in the BT and to determine if these antibodies could delineate epileptic seizures from PGSD.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Cases were solicited via the veterinary media (The Veterinary Times and Veterinary Record), internet (solicitation on BT forums and Facebook), international press (radio and newspaper driven), and also by personal contacts within the BT breed societies, asking primary veterinarians and owners to contact us regarding BTs presenting with abnormal paroxysmal episodes, including epileptic seizures and paroxysmal dyskinesia (PD). However, other disorders associated with BTs were included. Clinical assessment and serum antibody measurements were performed independently and before data analysis. The target population consisted of 4 groups: BTs with PD, BTs with idiopathic epilepsy (IE), BTs with other conditions, and healthy control BTs. Dogs fed a gluten-free diet prior to accession were excluded from the study.
Inclusion Criteria
Video footage of a representative episode was submitted by all owners (groups 1-3) and was reviewed to determine the likely origin of the episode based on the observed phenomenology and accompanying clinical history, ie, IE (group 1) versus PD (group 2). If the diagnosis was uncertain, or if the episode related to another problem, then the dog was assigned to a third group ("Other"; group 3); hence, this group included dogs with less stereotypical signs of PD, behavioral disorders, ambiguous paroxysmal episodes, and other conditions. A 4th group comprised healthy BTs with no known concurrent illness reported in the last 6 months; the control group. Dogs on immunosuppressive therapy and those already receiving a gluten-free or restricted diet were excluded from the study.
Inclusion criteria for assignment as PD or IE were that BTs be in good general health with an interictal neurological examination that detected no abnormalities and a history of abnormal episodes (3) for at least 1 year. If this was not fulfilled and transient episodes were observed and confirmed by video, BTs were grouped into the "Other" category.
Pedigrees, medical history, and litter information were collected. In the cases recruited via primary veterinarians, a full history was also requested and reviewed. If the owner had contacted us directly and was included in the study, consent was obtained to request and review the history from their primary veterinarian. This history supplemented the information gained from the questionnaire. Data were acquired from January 2014 to July 2017.
Presumptive Diagnosis
A diagnosis of PD was determined using clinical phenomenology of an episode from video footage (assessed by ML), an owner's account of

the episode, and historical information using guidelines described in a review on the subject.9 Specifically, BTs were diagnosed based on a combination of standard criteria that included no loss of consciousness despite motor manifestations in more than 1 limb, the absence of autonomic signs (specifically urination, defecation, and hypersalivation), and no postictal period. Involuntary movements matching the above description that were induced by sudden movements (such as rising from a period of lying down) increased the clinical suspicion of PD. Video 1 demonstrates the typical signs expected with PD. The diagnosis of IE was achieved based on video evidence demonstrating a typical generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) and including the presence of autonomic signs (specifically urination, defecation, and hypersalivation), a loss of awareness, and the observation of a postictal period (assessed by ML). GTCS in BTs with interictal abnormalities were excluded from the IE group and placed in the "Other" group. Episodes occurring from rest or sleep were considered more likely to reflect an epileptic seizure if they had the defining semiology described. Video 2 demonstrates the typical features of a GTCS. A review by 2 of the authors describes this decision process in more detail.9
Questionnaire
Before completion of the questionnaire, an interview via phone or email was performed in which an open description of the paroxysmal episodes was given by the owner. Having received the video, performed the interview, and undergone group assignation, owners were invited to complete a questionnaire. The questionnaire was presented online utilizing the online survey software tool SurveyMonkey (http://www. surveymonkey.com). It consisted of open-ended questions, to which the answer could be recorded verbatim, followed by specific leading questions. The majority of questions were closed questions with multiple choice answers. Questions directed toward the types and characteristics of the episodes also included an opportunity to provide a description verbatim of the episodes. Where more than 1 type of episode was observed, participants were asked to characterize each individually. The questions were designed to provide detailed phenotypic information in terms of the signalment of BTs, possible precipitating factors, current and previous diets, general health (including but not limited to signs of gastrointestinal, dermatological, or neurological disease), history of medication, and the characteristics of the episodes. Its purpose was to gather further information on the diagnosis achieved by video footage and initial interview, rather than to ensure correct group designation had been performed. Questions were randomized to prevent owners from drawing conclusions about the expected answer.
Serum Antibodies
Serum samples were collected from all BTs and samples were stored at 2708C until assayed. All serum samples from the control group were derived from routine clinical investigation. Consent was granted by clients on the clinical consent form for admission to the centers enrolled. Serum AGA IgG and anti-canine TG2 IgA concentrations were determined by ELISA,a according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, for detection of antibodies against canine tissue TG2, the antigen was coated onto a microtiter plate. The plate surface was blocked with bovine serum albumin prior to use with canine sera and control samples. Bound antibodies against canine TG2 were detected by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody against canine IgA. In the last step, the peroxidase converts a substrate (tetramethylbenzidine) into a blue product, which that upon addition of the stop solution (0.5 M H2SO4) turns yellow. Negative control values were recorded using a buffer and conjugate.
Regarding IgG anti-gliadin antibodies, the gliadin-coated microtiter plate from the ELISA for the determination of antibodies (IgG) against gliadin from Steffens Biotechnische Analysen was used.b Detection of bound antibodies against gliadin was obtained by incubation with

peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody against canine IgG1. Negative control values were recorded using a buffer and conjugate.
Statistical Analysis
For comparison of continuous variables, the independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test was performed. For comparison of categorical variables, the v2 test or Fisher exact test was employed. The association of AGA IgG and TG2 IgA with disease characteristics was assessed by Spearman's rank of order. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were determined. Sensitivity was defined as the probability of a positive test result for PD in a dog with the disease. Specificity was defined as the probability of having a negative result in a dog without PD. The likelihood ratio is a measure of the validity of a test, given its sensitivity and specificity. It is calculated as the ratio of the probability of getting a result in dogs with PD to the probability of getting that same result in dogs without the condition. For all statistical analyses, P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical tests were performed using a commercial software package.c
Results
Clinical Characteristics
Controls Twenty dogs were included as control subjects, with 9 female dogs (4 neutered) and 11 male dogs (5 neutered). The median age of control dogs was 29.5 months (range 12-85 months).
BTs with presumed PD This group comprised 45 dogs, with 19 female (7 spayed) and 26 male (9 neutered) dogs. Median age at first onset was 36 months (range 9-96 months). Episodes typically lasted from 1 minute up to 1 hour; their frequency ranged from once every 2-3 months up to once per year. General clinical and neurological examinations were normal between attacks in all affected dogs. Clinical features of the episodes included sustained muscular hypertonicity throughout (45/45), difficulty or an inability to stand and walk (40/45) and dystonia of 1 or more limbs (31/45). Other features reported included signs consistent with atopy (ie, dry skin, erythema, pruritus, chewing the pads, and reverse sneezing) (27/45) and signs suggestive of mild gastrointestinal disease (ie, intermittent vomiting, diarrhea, and borborygmi) (31/45). Therefore 20/45 (44%) dogs had both signs suggestive of gastrointestinal disease and a dermatopathy, 11/45 (24%) had just signs suggestive of gastrointestinal disease, and 7/27 (26%) had only signs suggestive of dermatological disease. The signs suggestive of gastrointestinal disease all predated the first episodes of dyskinesia. The signs suggestive of dermatological disease all occurred after the signs suggestive of gastrointestinal diseases, but might have preceded (8/27; 30%) or followed (19/27; 70%) the neurological signs. All affected BTs had PD when awake. Attacks were usually evoked by sudden movements: eg, standing up suddenly after a long period of sitting or running suddenly. Some dogs experienced attacks when their owner perceived they had encountered stress or anxiety, such as if another dog came into the home or just before the administration of deworming tablets. Although reported to arise after sudden movements, all episodes occurred exclusively at or after

rest, and never ensued after prolonged exercise or during sleep. Furthermore, only 1 owner reported their dog having an episode away from the home.
Involuntary intermittent movements, which could be unilateral, alternating, or bilateral, involved the head, neck, extremities, and trunk. No involuntary movements or twitching of the face were reported in any BT with PD. The single most common phenotypic presentation in our cases was that of dystonia, mirroring previous data,2 followed by tremors (fine oscillation of the muscle fibers) and whole body or head jerks (myoclonus). However, most cases presented with a combination of at least 2 movement disorders (eg, dyskinesia, myoclonus, and tremors) and 11 dogs presented with additional more complex movement disorders that were difficult to classify, involving manifestations such as head tremors10 and a trance-like syndrome,11 as defined in a previous study.
Twenty-one dogs exhibited postural dystonia, in that episodes were relieved on sitting or lying down. Sixteen dogs had stiffness of all 4 limbs and could not move during an episode. Unilateral muscle tightness was often the first observed sign in the majority of dogs, followed by ipsilateral choreoathetotic movements of 1 limb, subsequently spreading to hemidystonia/choreoathetosis and frequently progressing to generalized dystonic spasms and choreoathetotic movements in all 4 limbs. In dogs where limb involvement was not the first sign, head tremors or "bobbing" were frequently the preceding sign that would progress to result in dystonic and choreoathetotic movements of 1 or more limbs. Tremor, when present, would resolve on movement of the affected body part and was never observed as an isolated movement disturbance. Ballism was also a clinical sign occasionally observed in some of the affected dogs, although this was rare. A trance-like syndrome was observed in 2 dogs, but this was never associated with the episodes of dyskinesia.
BTs with presumed IE This group comprised 28 dogs with 12 female (5 spayed) and 16 male (5 neutered) dogs. Seizure onset was between 12 and 85 months with a median of 48 months. All 28 dogs had GTCS confirmed by video footage. Twelve dogs were reported by the owners to also have partial seizures, although none had been captured on video. Of these 12 dogs with partial seizures, all exhibited secondary generalization. Therefore, no dog was included in the study with isolated partial seizures. Approximately half the dogs had seizures more than once a month; the frequency of seizures in the remaining dogs ranged from 1 every 2 months to 1 every 12 months. The median frequency was 1 every 81 days. Clinical features observed during seizures, corroborated by video footage, included loss of consciousness (28/28; 100%), recumbency (28/28; 100%), salivation (26/28; 93%), urination (6/28; 21%), and defecation (4/28; 14%). Regarding the focal seizures (12/28), all owners reported episodes consisting of facial twitching that might or might not spread to involve 1 or other forelimb, although these reports could not be confirmed by video. Salivation was reported by the owners in 8/12 dogs (66%) with suspected partial seizures. Nineteen

of the 28 dogs were receiving antiepileptic medication at the time of analysis. No dogs were found to suffer from epileptic seizures and PD.
BTs with other conditions** Thirty-five BTs were diagnosed with other conditions. Eighteen dogs were female (7 neutered) and 17 were male (7 neutered) dogs. Median age at first onset was 24 months (range 4-152 months). Other conditions included dogs with gastrointestinal complaints (18/35), skin disease (12/35), and episodes that were considered neurological but did not fulfill the clinical criteria to be dyskinesia or IE (12/35). Such episodes included myoclonus (3/35), intermittent tremors (3/35), GTCS associated with a brain tumor (2/35), head bobbing (2/35), trance-like syndrome (2/35), suspected sleep disorder (1/35), and myokymia (1/35).
Epidemiological analyses Male and female dogs were equally distributed between groups. There was a significant difference in age onset between dogs with PGSD and IE (P < 0.013), with cases of PGSD presenting younger. There was also a significant difference in mean episode frequency and duration between IE and PGSD (P < 0.041 and P < 0.002, respectively) with epileptic seizures being more frequent but shorter in duration.
Serological Characteristics
Controls Values for AGA IgG ranged from 0.03 to 0.27 (median 0.11). Values for TG2 IgA ranged from 0.16 to 0.53 (median 0.22). The cut-off value for negativity was set to 0.27 for AGA IgG and 0.53 for TG2 IgA based on the results of the control dogs.
BTs with presumed PD Serum concentrations of AGA IgG were increased above the control values in 38/45 BTs (median 0.35; range 0.11-1.68) and of TG2 IgA were increased in 41/45 BTs (median 1.31; range 0.19-2.68) in the PD group. Four BTs had normal values for both AGA IgG and TG2 IgA, but none had a history of signs suggestive of gastrointestinal disease, 3 had a mild dermatopathy.
BTs with presumed IE AGA IgG and TG2 IgA concentrations were within the control range in 26/28 dogs. Two BTs in the epileptic seizure group had positive concentrations of both AGA IgG and TG2 IgA. One of these dogs was reported to have a persistent skin problem diagnosed at the referring vet as atopy. The other dog had occasional vomiting after eating, but this had never been investigated. Neither of these dogs was reported to have suffered partial seizures. The median concentration for AGA IgA was 0.20 (range 0.06-0.51) and was 0.40 for TG2 IgA (range 0.02-1.07).
BTs with other conditions AGA IgG concentrations were increased in 16/35 dogs and TG2 IgA concentrations were increased in 19/35 dogs in the "Other" group. All 16 dogs with normal AGA IgG concentrations also had normal TG2 IgA concentrations. All dogs with

increased concentrations had signs suggestive of either a dermatopathy, gastrointestinal condition, or both. The remaining 16 dogs with antibody concentrations within the control range exhibited atopy (4/16), intermittent tremors (2/16), myoclonus (2/16), head bobbing (2/16), GTCS associated with a brain tumor (2/16), trance-like syndrome (2/16), suspected sleep disorder (1/16), and myokymia (1/16). The median concentration for AGA IgA was 0.26 (range 0.04-0.27) and was 0.22 for TG2 IgA (range 0.16-0.53).
Serum antibodies As shown in Figure 1, AGA IgG were significantly increased in BTs with PD, compared with IE (P 5 0.012), controls (P < 0.0001) and other (P 5 0.018) conditions. There was no significant difference in AGA IgG concentrations in BT controls compared with IE (P 5 1.00) and other (P 5 1.00) conditions. A significant difference was also observed in TG2 IgA concentrations in BTs with PD, compared with IE (P < 0.0001), controls (P < 0.0001) and other (P 5 0.012) conditions (Fig 2). There was no significant difference in TG2 IgA concentrations in BT controls compared with IE (P 5 1.00) and other (P 5 1.00) conditions. The prevalence of increased AGA IgG and TG2 IgA concentrations was evaluated among all dogs. Overall, the prevalence of increased AGA IgG and TG2 IgA concentrations in PD was 84% (38/45) and 91% (41/45), respectively, which was higher than values in IE (AGA IgG, 7%, 2/28; TG2 IgA, 7%, 2/28), other (AGA IgG, 46%, 16/35; TG2 IgA, 54%, 19/35), and control BTs (AGA IgG, 0%, 0/20; TG2 IgA, 0%, 0/20). To further assess the potential role of these autoantibodies in distinguishing BTs with PD from those with IE, P values were calculated between PD BTs and IE BTs. A significantly higher prevalence of increased AGA IgG and TG2 IgA concentrations was detected in BTs

with PD (41/45, 91%), compared with BTs with IE (2/28, 7%) (P 5 0.0001).
Given that AGA IgG and TG2 IgA demonstrated a good performance in distinguishing PD from IE, we evaluated the predictive power of these 2 antibodies in distinguishing PD from IE once dogs with signs suggestive of gastrointestinal and dermatological manifestations were removed from analysis. This raised the specificity and positive predictive value to 100%, but decreased the sensitivity to 62.5-75% (Table 1). The cut-off value for negativity was set to 0.27 for AGA IgG and 0.53 for TG2 IgA, based on the results of the control dogs.
Discussion
Our study confirmed a multisystem manifestation of gluten sensitivity in BTs. Our results suggest that serological assays are able to reliably identify PGSD in the BT, but that

other gluten-sensitive conditions can give a false-positive result.
Gluten sensitivity is defined as a state of heightened immunological responsiveness to ingested gluten in genetically susceptible individuals.12 Such responsiveness might find expression in organs other than the gut. The typical presentation of NCGS in people is a combination of signs suggestive of gastrointestinal disease such as abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, or constipation followed by manifestations of extraintestinal disease, such as dermatological or neurological complaints. The focus of this study was on neurological manifestations of gluten sensitivity in BTs, so-called PGSD. It is striking that a proportion of dogs presented with gluten sensitivity manifesting as enteropathy or dermatopathy. Future studies should examine the role of various subtypes of TG in BTs to see if specific subtypes are increased with variable system expression. In the absence of canine specific TG antibodies, it is not currently possible to measure subtypes of TG.
There continues to be controversy about using phenomenological characteristics to distinguish an epileptic seizure from a PD in dogs and people. This study has shown that PGSD and epileptic seizures can be clearly separated from video footage and historical information gleaned from the owner, with this division being confirmed with serological testing. Epilepsy remains a clinical diagnosis--the history provides critical diagnostic information in most patients but it is the recognition of the epileptic event by the attending clinician that guides diagnosis. In dogs, some consider PGSD to be one of the differential diagnoses for partialonset motor seizures, although they are distinguishable by their reproducible triggers (eg, stress, startle), lack of facial involvement, and absence of secondary generalization. Attack semiology is also different with dystonia, chorea, ballism, or a mixture, and frequent bilateral involvement, as opposed to the unilateral focal clonus of a single limb and the involuntary facial contractions of partial-onset motor seizures. Unfortunately, we did not identify dogs suffering only partial-onset motor seizures in this study and instead had dogs with relatively characteristic signs of GTCS. The devil's advocate would state that we did indeed include partial-onset motor seizures but incorrectly included them as PGSD and these dogs were represented in the results by the 4 BTs with normal serological values for TG2 and gliadin antibodies. However, partial-onset motor seizures involve only 1 body part, as opposed to the 4 seronegative

BTs in the PD group that exhibited involvement of all 4 limbs during an episode, excluding them from the definition of partial-onset motor seizures. Electroencephalography, despite its limitations, might help to confirm these findings but our study shows the robust nature of using semiological characteristics alone to differentiate GTCS and PDs.
Paroxysmal movement disorders are being increasingly recognized in dogs. Despite their prevalence, there are a number of knowledge gaps with regards to their recognition, pathophysiology, management, and long-term outcome. One of the key advancements made in this study is the refinement of the diagnostic work-up to focus more on positive criteria (rather than by exclusion of organic causes), with serological markers being diagnostic for PGSD in BTs. However, biomarkers can change in response to a particular therapeutic intervention and in this case the institution of a gluten-free diet can normalize, or at least reduce, concentrations of gluten-specific antibodies.3 This means the utility of antibody markers to gluten might become diminished in dogs already receiving a gluten-free diet. This part of the history taking is therefore integral to obtaining a representative result when performing gluten serology. The advantage of such specificity is in monitoring the compliance of dietary therapy and so repeated serum testing is indicated once the correct diet is implemented. Furthermore, sensitivity of these markers is just below 90% due to the fact that these markers are not exclusive to neurological disease. The degree by which a gluten-free diet might affect the serological data was not investigated here due to the exclusion of dogs already receiving the aforementioned diet.
It seems appropriate to label our observations as gluten sensitivity in the BT. The BTs described herein demonstrate that the phenotype of gluten sensitivity might range from an enteropathy to extraintestinal disease. It remains obscure why some BTs experience PD, mild signs suggestive of gastrointestinal disease, and no skin involvement, whereas some experience mild atopy with often only mild or perhaps subclinical enteropathy with or without neurological signs. In people, CD and dermatitis herpetiformis share the same genetic involvement, further confirming that these entities are not separate disorders but belong to the same spectrum of genetic gluten intolerance.13 It seems likely a similar genetic phenomenon underlies our observations given the apparent restriction of this condition to the BT. The identification of 4 BTs with the PGSD phenotype that were serologically negative for gliadin and TG2 antibodies suggests that the presence of PD in this breed should not automatically infer a gluten-related sensitivity. Instead, a separate pathogenesis should be considered to explain this phenomenon. We currently have no data on the clinical response of these dogs to a gluten-free diet.
Several limitations in this study need to be highlighted. Age-matched controls were not possible given the apparent prevalence of signs potentially relating to cutaneous, neurological, and gastrointestinal conditions in the BTs included. Dogs were not given a gluten-free diet to monitor the serological and clinical response of the clinical signs observed. Therefore, many of these clinical signs could be glutenindependent and any potential correlation of antibody titer to PD might only have a spurious relationship. However,

the association of such clinical signs with increased antibody concentrations against gliadin and TG-2 is supportive of such an association. It is also uncertain where the line between neurological signs and signs suggestive of gastrointestinal disease should be drawn. Dyskinesia is relatively easy to identify where involuntary movements of 1 or more limb are observed. However, it is our belief that esophageal reflux can result in pain and hence make a dog tremor. Tremors are frequently considered to be neurological but in this circumstance and in the dogs seen here it is more likely they were secondary to the gastrointestinal condition.
Conclusions
Gluten sensitivity is a condition of BTs in which the leading manifestation is neurological signs. However, recognition of PGSD has identified a wide spectrum of additional clinical presentations, with signs suggestive of dermatological and gastrointestinal disease also being observed. This might have implications in the diagnosis of PGSD based on serology alone. If a BT is presented with signs suggestive of gastrointestinal and/or dermatological disease, then this might represent a manifestation of NCGS and antibody testing could be positive. Therefore, positive serological assay results for PGSD should only be interpreted in light of the other clinical signs present.

Cardiac Angiofibroma is an uncommon intracardiac tumor. Thus far, only 4 cases of the rare intracardiac tumor have been reported. The present case-report describes an intracardiac angiofibroma in a 57-year-old healthy female. The patient was incidentally diagnosed with a left ventricle mass during echocardiography. We performed cardiac imaging, surgical excision and histological evaluation of the mass. The angiofibroma demonstrated features different from the relatively common cardiac tumors such as fibroma, myxoma and angiosarcoma. The cardiac MRI showed slightly high signal intensity on both T1 and T2, with the central core of lower signal intensity. The resected tumor was a whitish and rubbery mass. Histologically, the tumor showed the benign vascular proliferations associated with the surrounding collagen deposition. (Korean Circ J 2013;43:636-639)

Introduction
Primary cardiac tumors are rare across all age groups, with a reported prevalence of 0.001% to 0.03% in the autopsy series.1)
Cardiac angiofibroma is a rare cardiac tumor, with only 4 cases having been reported worldwide. Among them, there has been no report that has discussed the tumor's characteristics on the cardiac MRI.
Thus, we report a case regarding an angiofibroma which has primarily originated from the left ventricle of the heart.

for a left ventricular (LV) tumor that was discovered incidentally. The tumor was found by echocardiography which was performed for the baseline evaluation of hypertension.
The echocardiography showed a round-shaped, immobile and echogenic mass attached at the LV apex. The valve and LV functions were normal (Fig. 1D).
Cardiac MRI was performed to determine the tumor's tissue type and its relations to other cardiac structures. It showed a slightly high signal intensity on both T1 and T2 weighted images. The gadoliniumenhanced cardiac MRI showed a hypoperfused tumor core and peripheral enhancement (Fig. 1).
In addition, the lesion showed the centripetal enhancement pattern during the first-pass infusion of the gadolium-containing contrast (Fig. 2). The features of such are associated with the vascular tumors such as liver hemangioma.
The mass showed peripheral enhancement with the central sparing on the delayed enhanced imaging (Fig. 1C). It suggested that the tumor had an abundant fibrous content as well as a vascular content.2)3)
In this patient, the initial preoperative diagnosis of the mass was fibrous tumor of the LV apex. The patient was referred to a cardiac surgeon for the removal of the cardiac mass. Intraoperatively, a whitish, solid mass was detached from the base of the anterolateral papillary muscle (Fig. 3).
On the histologic evaluation, it showed a somewhat well-demarcated collagenous mass arising from the myocardium (Fig. 4A, arrows). The high-power view showed multiple irregular vascular ch-

annels (Fig. 4B) with intervening dense collagen deposition in the mass. The desmin immunohistochemistry and trichrome staining confirmed that the stroma consisted of dense collagenous tissue, not smooth muscle (Fig. 4C and D). From these histologic findings, we diagnosed the mass as angiofibroma. The patient is currently doing well without any evidence of recurrence at the 2-year follow-up.
Discussion
Cardiac angiofibroma is a rare cardiac tumor, with only 4 cases having been reported worldwide. Two of the cases were diagnosed at childhood and related to the systemic congenital defects. In the first case, tuberous sclerosis was associated with the tumor which was found in the child.4) In the second case, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome was associated with the tumor.5)
Cao et al.6) reported a case regarding angiofibroma which was located in the right atrium and inferior vena cava. It was unclear wh-

ether it was a primary cardiac tumor or vascular tumor extending to the intracardiac cavity. The last case was reported from Russia in 1986.7) None of these cases had the cardiac MRI evaluation; and all 4 cases could not be confirmed as a primary cardiac tumor.
Some tumors, like fibroma, hemangioma and rhabdomyoma, usually arise from the ventricle. Angiofibroma is distinguished from these ventricle-origin tumors by their histologic and image findings such as the cardiac MRI.
In this case, the cardiac angiofibroma showed the centripetal enhancement pattern during the first-pass infusion of the gadoliumcontaining contrast. The features of such are associated with vascular tumors such as liver hemangioma. It suggested that the tumor had an abundant fibrous content as well as a vascular content.
However, fibromas have higher fibrous content and small vascular content. Therefore, the tumors often demonstrate little or no contrast-material enhancement. Similarly, rhabdomyoma is hypointense to myocardium after the contrast-material administration.

In immunohistochemistry, CD31 is used primarily to demonstrate the presence of endothelial cells in the histological tissue sections. Desmin is used to demonstrate the smooth muscle cells. In fibroma, the staining for CD 31 and desmin should be negative.
In this case, angiofibroma showed benign vascular proliferations associated with the surrounding collagen deposition. The immunohistochemical staining for CD31 and desmin were positive and negative, respectively.
In summary, we described the MRI and pathologic findings of a cardiac angiofibroma of the LV. These features were considered to be associated with the fibrous and vascular component of the tumor.

Abstract
A few decades ago, the therapy goal of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was survival and the prevention of organ failure. Today, clinical remission and low disease activity are believed to be the optimal therapeutic targets. These aims are difficult to reach for many patients, but they still do not address the healthrelated quality of life (QoL) that is significantly impaired in SLE patients. Even in the state of remission, QoL and fatigue are insufficient controlled. Thus, patient-oriented research is essential to design new strategies for the management of lupus patients. The INTEGRATE project analyses the patients' and physicians' perspectives to pave the way to design an innovative therapeutic strategy for lupus and focuses on the multifaceted dimensions of the disease burden. Shared decision making (SDM) could include the patient's perspective of SLE to treatment strategy and consider QoL and the burden of lupus into the process of therapy decision.

Introduction
During the past decades, the lives of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus changed dramatically. Due to improved diagnostics and effective, less toxic drug regimens, the understanding of lupus changed from an acute life threatening disease to a chronic disease with a high disease burden. Thus, the concept of treat-totarget (T2T) is transferred to lupus. Remission as defined by the DORIS (definition of remission in SLE) criteria [1] and the Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) [2]

are actually used as targets focusing on disease activity and treatment, but do not address the health-related quality of life or disease burden. SLE patients often feel misunderstood and complain that not all aspects of the disease are addressed by their doctor as described by an analysis of patients recruited by self-help groups in Great Britain and Ireland [3]. Their statements underline the importance of a patient's perspective in treatment decisions, but it is still not accepted as equivalent to the physician's perspective in treatment decisions. Healthrelated quality of life (QoL) is neither directly nor indirectly captured by disease activity instruments and seems not to be significantly affected by disease activity [4]. Fatigue - the most prominent symptom of lupus, and a major contributor to QoL - is only addressed in some instruments [5]. The relation of QoL and damage, shown in the SLICC cohort [6], may be used as an indicator that the physician's view is also addressing the patient's perspective. Some physicians fear looking at the patient's perspective, because of uncertainties of how to face and treat it [7]. The aim of this review is to

discuss the integration of QoL and disease burden as therapy targets in SLE. Do we need these additional targets? What would change in the life of lupus patients? How can these targets be addressed?
QoL in SLE
QoL is significantly impaired in SLE patients caused by a high disease burden [8]. Therefore, QoL is a great candidate as a therapy target and, if payers and reimbursement systems would decide about relevance, QoL has clearly the highest impact as target. In lupus patients, all three dimensions of health-related QoL are affected: physical, mental and social health [9]. There is evidence that the physical domain is related to disease activity and may therefore improve with remission. Other aspects like fatigue, sleep and sexual function are not captured by remission state based on clinical activity control. In addition, psychosocial illness, cognitive impairment and anxiety as components of mental health are not affected by DORIS remission status. A German longitudinal study estimated that 60% of the physical component of the Short Form 36 (SF-36)is explained by clinical and laboratory findings in SLE and may therefore follow clinical remission, compared with only 25% of the mental component [10].
Poor physical and mental QoL is often due to pain, fatigue, work or school impairment, skin manifestations and UV sensitivity, distorted body image, inability to do previous activities, and impairment on intimate relationships [11-14]. An analysis of relevant concepts of functioning in daily life identified the same causes [15]. In total, 54% of SLE patients working full or part time scored their QoL significantly higher compared with non-working patients [16]. In addition, work disability in SLE patients is related to the same predictors that influence QoL: pain, fatigue, anxiety and neurocognitive involvement. Other factors are not modifiable, like age, race, education and socioeconomic status [17-19].
One of the major determinants of QoL, functioning and work ability in SLE patients is fatigue [20]. As shown in a European survey, for example, fatigue is not only the most common symptom in SLE, it significantly impairs all domains assessed by SF-36 [21]. To approach the symptom fatigue, instruments like the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-F) or the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) were created and validated [22]. However, they do not allow a clear differentiation of possible causes.
In some cases, modifiable causes like anaemia or hypothyroidism may be found, but in most patients, fatigue is unexplained [4]. Disease activity, measured by Patient reported outcomes (PRO) like the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire (SLAQ), is associated with fatigue. In contrast, SLEDAI or BILAG do not correlate with fatigue. This suggests that fatigue has a strong negative impact on the patient perception of the disease. Thus, SLAQ as a target in defining remission would include the patient's burden of the disease. However, this would also include depressiveness in the

assessment of remission, as depressiveness is often associated with fatigue [23].
Another, less good evaluated determinant of QoL in lupus may be the choice of therapy and experienced or expected side effects [10, 24].
Treatment targets in lupus
Classical treatment targets in lupus can be found in the items of disease activity instruments. These are laboratory parameters like levels of complement or proteinuria as well as clinical symptoms like arthritis, erythema and seizures. The control or normalization of these symptoms and laboratory parameters are used for the assessment of disease control. The absence of major symptoms and signs of SLE is the basis of remission, a desirable outcome for patients with SLE [1]. Analyses from several cohorts demonstrate that staying in remission or LLDAS is associated with a favourable outcome [25-29]. Therefore, it is actually the most relevant target of treatment in lupus. It still has to be shown that treating active lupus patients to reach remission is equal to being in remission. In addition, the minimal treatment during remission (off/on immunosuppression) to prevent flares remains unknown.
In clinical trials, the target response is mostly defined by changes in disease activity instruments and physician global assessments [30]. QoL and fatigue are only evaluated as secondary targets, although FDA rules would allow a PRO as primary outcome [31].
Effects of remission on QoL
The physicians' view on lupus dominated the development of remission criteria. It was postulated that a control of disease activity would improve the QoL in SLE. The following data seems to confirm this postulation: Mok et al. showed in a Chinese lupus patients cohort that long-term remission is associated with better QoL [32]. Using the SF-36, major effects were seen in the physical component, whereas the mental component was unchanged by remission. In two other cohorts, this effect increased with the time in remission [33, 34]. Interestingly, adjustment for age, depression and fatigue did not change any of the findings [33]. Applying LupusPro, Mok et al. demonstrated there was no difference between the remission/nonremission groups in lupus-specific non-health-related domains like desire, social support, coping and satisfaction with medical care [32]. Goswami et al. showed in a young Indian population that remission may further improve the physical component (of SF-12), but not the mental component [35]. But, this paper published neither clinical data at the time of observation nor QoL data over time. Data from the Amsterdam cohort postulated that `disease-related factors are mainly determinants of the physical domain of health-related quality of life' [36] and showed that in a follow-up period over two years, a

change in QoL status was independent of the remission status.
In the LUMINA cohort, with low percentages of remission and LLDAS and low QoL, the mental component increased with the time in remission/LLDAS [34]. Analyses from the Almenera lupus cohort confirmed significant effects of remission/LLDAS on planning and emotional health using the LupusQoL [37]. In a cohort from Thailand, all domains of LupusQoL, mental less than physical, were improved in remission/LLDAS [38].
Although longitudinal data are missing to confirm the impact of clinical remission on QoL in SLE, there is evidence that patients in remission experience a higher QoL. But this relationship is mostly based on physical signs, symptoms and pain.
QoL as target in SLE
Looking at the evidence of PROs for outcome in SLE, it is important to state that PROs were never used as the primary end point in clinical trials. In randomized controlled trials, PROs were often collected and mostly exploratively analysed. There is no evidence that PROs can validly define the above-described status of a controlled disease.
Clinical trial data exhibit that QoL and fatigue may respond to therapy. Although there were some inconsistencies in SF-36 responses to belimumab in RCTs, the detectable response of QoL to belimumab was confirmed in a post-hoc analysis of responders vs nonresponders: all SF-36 domains, including the mental, improved significantly and were clinically meaningful in responders [39]. The same was observed for the FACITF score from day 56. A similar improvement of fatigue was reported by data analysing the effect of subcutaneous blisibimod and sifalimumab [40, 41]. Six-year followup data for belimumab confirmed the positive effect on QoL and fatigue, but exhibited clearly the significant effect on the physical component of SF-36 [42].
An Italian inception cohort demonstrated that despite improvement of nearly all symptoms in the first 12 months in newly diagnosed SLE, mean QoL of the patients worsened [43]. Data from the SLICC cohort exhibited, surprisingly, that despite an excellent recovery from a cerebrovascular event, the patients suffered from consistently limited QoL [44].
Meaningful effects on QoL are seen by physical training, which significantly improves vitality and the physical domain of SF-36 [45-47]. Psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy may improve the mental component score of the SF-36 score, although the data is not consistent [48-50]. In our cohort of patients suffering from disease burden, psychoeducation led to significant and prolonged response in all SF-36 domains but physical function [51].

QoL and burden of lupus mandatory for treat to target and remission
Based on actual recommendations, remission is the target in daily management in SLE patients [52], but QoL and fatigue are insufficient controlled in the state of remission and despite improvement of disease activity, QoL can remain unchanged over several years [14]. Thus, QoL may be more related to age and damage than activity [53]. However, this may be different for some disease manifestations (e.g. active inflammatory skin manifestations in exposed areas) [54, 55].
We still accept the discordance between the physicians' and the patients' perspective as recently shown by Golder et al. [56]: the primary view on organ manifestations vs the inhibited ability to perform in daily life. Why are these two perspectives not integrable? The wellbeing of our patient should be the highest aim in daily practice, not only as an aspect of reimbursement for QUALYs. An explanation for not taking care of the burden of illness is that physicians cannot explain these handicaps, they cannot separate whether they are related to the disease lupus or something else, like fibromyalgia. However, we cannot explain risks for lupus flares, drivers of organ activations, and why some patients respond to medications and others do not, etc. We still treat the disease to the best of our knowledge, perform parallel analyses like proteomics, genomics and epigenetics, and invest in clinical trials. Now it is time to transfer QoL and the burden of lupus to treatment. We need to identify reasons for fatigue, learn to address the causes and perform trials to document the efficacy of specific interventions.
Our actual recommendations do not only call for T2T; shared decision-making (SDM) is also endorsed in the overarching principals [52]. SDM is not yet proven in SLE; it is more than explaining what needs to be done and it must be the basis for every T2T concept. With an integrated SDM, the patient's perspective of SLE will be part of the treatment strategy and consider bringing QoL and burden of lupus into the process of deciding strategy.
Some data suggest that among patients with rheumatic diseases, QoL can be influenced by the nature of interaction of patients with their physician and that the quality of communication with the physician is linked to patient outcomes [57].
Positive patient-physician interactions, such as including the patient in treatment decisions, are associated with higher satisfaction with treatment regimens, a more favourable perception of current health, and being more hopeful about future health [58].
At the onset of disease, patients fall into an unexpected state of emotional, behavioural and cognitive stress. Thereafter, patients should be empowered to be coproducers of their own health to improve its outcome. According to the patient health engagement (PHE) model, patient engagement is a dynamic process in which patients (after the initial denial of the disease) experience

an enhanced awareness of symptoms and finally reach the status of acceptance. Physicians may contribute to this process, supporting patients in understanding the functioning of the disease, the usefulness of prescriptions, and, importantly, sustaining them in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and making new life plans [59].
The answer to what is the most relevant in the management of SLE patients - clinical symptoms, biological information or PROs as target - is: the integration of all important aspects of the disease. This implies more than the statistical evaluation of the best items of these three aspects, it is the active involvement of patients in their care: patient empowerment in SLE, a process in which both the patient and the physician have to learn a lot from and about each other.
Patient-oriented research may be useful to design a new strategy for the management of patients with lupus, based on the integration of patient and physician perspectives.
Thus a pilot EU-founded project (https://www.integratesle.eu) has been launched by the University of Pisa, University of Duesseldorf and the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna. Patients and physicians have been called to actively participate in the study to discuss their perspectives through ad-hoc surveys and dedicated focus groups. The results of the INTEGRATE project will pave the way to design an innovative therapeutic strategy for lupus, and more generally for chronic diseases, which focusses on the multifaceted dimensions of the disease burden.

Abstract
Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether somatic nonsynonymous variants in tumor tissue can potentially be identified in circulating cellfree DNA (cfDNA) of head and neck oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients using next-generation sequencing and can predict recurrence or persistence disease. Methods: A total of 22 OPSCC patients with tumor tissue and respective plasma samples were included in this study. Matching cfDNA and tumor tissues were processed, and DNA sequencing was conducted using the MiSeq platform. Variants were identified using Biomedical Genomic Workbench and Genialis's online data analysis platform for Swift Biosciences' Accel-amplicon panels. Results: Among 11 nonresponders, 6 matched mutations were detected in 5 patients suggesting a predictive factor for patients with likelihood of recurrence. The matched variants and their allele frequencies identified in the nonresponder group were (tumor DNA/cfDNA in %): TP53 G325fs (27/0.62), TP53 R282W (48/1.74), TP53 R273C (39/2.17), FBXW7 R505G (30/0.6), FBXW7 R505L (31/0.65), and TP53 Q331H (56.5/0.52). Interestingly, the matched somatic mutations were only detected in patients who did not respond to therapy or had persistent disease. Conclusions: Somatic nonsynonymous variants in tumor tissue can potentially be identified in cfDNA of OPSCC patients using NGS. The likelihood of variant detection in cfDNA is greater in nonresponders, especially in human papillomavirus-negative nonresponders, rendering it beneficial as a less invasive detection method for disease persistence/recurrence and prognosis. Level of evidence: Cohort study.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) encompass all cancers arising in the mucosa of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx. HNSCC is the sixth leading common malignancy worldwide with high rates of mortality and morbidity.1 HNSCC accounts for more than 650 000 cases and 330 000 deaths worldwide, annually. In the United States alone, it is estimated that approximately 53 000 Americans develop HNSCC annually and about 10 800 deaths occur due to tobacco, alcohol use, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.2-4 Unfortunately, the 5-year mortality rate stands at approximately 50% despite advances in multimodal therapy over the past two decades for the non-HPV associated cancers. Furthermore, the prognosis of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC is generally poor. The median survival in most series is 6 to 12 months depending upon patient and disease-related factors. Thus, there is a need for better detection measures to determine persistent or recurrent disease that could potentially lead to improved survival as a result of salvage surgery.
Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is extracellular DNA found in circulating blood. The presence of cancer-specific genomic alterations allows the differentiation between circular tumor DNA (ctDNA) and DNA from normal healthy cells. Similar to DNA from apoptotic cells, cfDNA consist of a range of multiples of 180 bp, consistent with the unit size of nucleosomes.5-7 Recent studies have identified increased levels of circulating DNA fragments in patients with cancer.8-13 Recent advances have also aided in identifying epigenetic and genetic characteristics of HNSCC in multiple data sets.14 Leveraging information from these genetic alterations and applying it in the context of ctDNA carrying information on tumor-related genetic and epigenetic changes may help identify recurrences or persistent disease.
Our primary goal was to determine if somatic nonsynonymous variants could be identified in cfDNA of OPSCC patients. Furthermore, we also investigated the extent to which the mutations found in the ctDNA correlated to those altered in paired tumor tissues. Finally, we elucidated if variants determined in the ctDNA correlated with response to treatment, recurrence, or persistent disease.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Study design
An Institutional Review Board approved retrospective study was conducted on 22 patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx treated at Louisiana State University Health Shreveport. HPV status was determined based on p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tumor samples. Patients were selected based on the

following criteria: (a) diagnosis of OPSCC (HPV+ and HPV-) between the years 2008 and 2014 and staging according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging eighth edition; (b) available plasma specimens and matched flash frozen tumors; (c) stage III or IV with at least N1 disease; and (d) free of distant metastases, M0. Patients were included in the study only if 2 years follow-up data were available. Patients were divided into either disease-free or nonresponders to standard therapy based on radiographic data and clinical follow-up 2 years posttreatment (Table 1, 2). No statistically significant difference in patient demographics was observed between the disease-free and nonresponder groups suggesting a Gaussian distribution in patient samples. The patients were treated using standard therapy based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for OPSCC (https://www.nccn.org). The time to recurrence or persistence for the nonresponder was determined to be 0 to 11.7 months with an average of 2.6 months and median of 0 months. For followup, the mean value accounting for both the groups was 38.6 months with the mean at 30.6 months and a range of 5.9 to 98 months.
2.2 | Sample preparation and DNA extraction
All specimens were collected at diagnosis and before any treatment. Blood cells and plasma were separated by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes and stored locally at a -80C freezer within 10 minutes after collection. Circulating cfDNA was extracted from plasma using Zymo's Quick-cfDNA Serum and Plasma Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, about 1.5 to 3 mL of plasma was mixed with S&P 5 Digestion Buffer and digested by incubating with Proteinase K solution at 55C over 30 minutes. Postdigestion, the DNA lysate was added with two volumes of S&P DNA Binding Buffer and then transferred to a Zymo-Spin III-S Column. After centrifuging at 1000g for 2 minutes, the flow-through was discarded. The column was washed with S&P DNA Prep Buffer once and followed with S&P DNA Wash Buffer twice. The cfDNA was eluted with DNA Elution Buffer. The size distribution of extracted cfDNA was examined with Agilent Tapestation 2200 with high-sensitivity D1000 tape system. In some samples, non-cfDNA contamination was removed by Zymo's Select-A-Size DNA Clean & Concentrator kit. The size distribution of extracted cfDNA is shown on Figure 1.Tissue DNA was extracted from flash frozen tissue with NucleoSpin Tissue kit (MACHEREYNAGEL GmbH & Co. KG). Briefly, 25 mg of tissue was ground and digested by proteinase K at 56C overnight and then lysed at 70C for 10 minutes. After grinding and washing in the column, DNA was eluted. The quality of genomic DNA from tissue samples was evaluated by Agilent Tape station 2200 with genomic tape system. Irrespective of the concentration of cfDNA obtained from patients, 200 ng of cfDNA was used for all analyses.

2.4 | Detection of mutations in cfDNA

F I G U R E 1 Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) size distribution. cfDNA was extracted from plasma and analyzed using Agilent 2200 to determine fragment size and concentration

To identify the variants in our DNA samples by NGS, we prepared the library with the Accel-Amplicon 56G Oncology Panel v2 from Swift Biosciences. This panel has hotspot coverage of 56 clinical oncology-related genes and most common mutations in head and neck cancer.15 This panel uses a 263-amplicon design covering 16 000 mutations. Furthermore, the panel requires the input to be as low as 10 ng. The average amplicon size is about 138 bp compatible with the size limitation of our cfDNA. Also, over 95% on-target specificity and uniformity strengthen the reliability of this panel. First, we tested the panel with A Q-Seq HDx quantitative multiplex DNA reference standard (HD701). This standard DNA contains 6 genes and 11 variants with expected allele frequency from 1% to 24.5%. The test results showed that the detected allele frequency of 11 variants is similar to the expected allele frequency (Table 1), indicating that the panel will generate reliable results and meet our standards.

2.3 | DNA sequencing
Genomic DNA was quantified by Thermo Fisher's Qubit 2.0 with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit. CfDNA was quantified by quantative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using Alu primers. Library was prepared with Swift Biosciences's Accel-Amplicon 56G Oncology Panel v2. Briefly, 20 ng DNA were amplified with multiplex PCR using genespecific primers. The PCR product was size selected and cleaned up with SPRI select beads (Beckman Coulter) and dual-indexed with Illumina's sequencing adapters. After second size selection and cleanup, the library was quantified by qPCR using KAPA Library Quantification Kits (Roche). A pair-end DNA sequencing was conducted on Illumina's MiSeq platform with MiSeq Reagent Kits v2 (2  150) and adapter-

2.5 | Bioinformatics analysis of sequencing data
Demultiplex fastq files were analyzed by two work flows, somatic cancer work flow for targeted amplicon sequencing in Biomedical Genomics Workbench (BGW) (Qiagen) and Swift Bio Accel-Amplicon panel pipelines of Genialis (Genialis).In somatic workflow of BGW, pairedend reads were imported into BGW and failed reads were excluded according to Illumina pipeline 1.8 or later. The primers were trimmed out according to primer list of Swift Biosciences. Reads were aligned with the hg19 human reference genome. A ready-to-use workflow for targeted amplicon sequencing was selected. The default setting was applied. The QC reports and variant calls in the targeting regions were

generated according to bed files for Accel-Amplicon 56G Oncology Panel v2. A minimum frequency for variant detection was set at 5% for tumor tissue and 0.5% for cfDNA sequencing data, respectively. Through Swift Bio Accel-Amplicon panel pipeline for Accel-Amplicon 56G Oncology Panel v2, fastq data were aligned with hg19 human reference genome. Variants were called by GATK haplotype caller and LoFreg. Reported variant calls were further filtered by read count, read coverage, frequency, forward/reverse balance, homopolymer status, and non-synonymous status. Amino acid change was

determined. The Oncoprint of ctDNA was prepared with D3Oncoprint software (Alida Palmisano, Yingdong Zhao and Richard Simon. JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics, 2018. nr. 2, p. 1-9).

responders," referring to those who experience persistence or recurrence. Sociodemographic characteristics, tumor characteristics, HPV status, and treatment variables were measured. Continuous variables are presented as mean (SD), whereas categorical variables are presented as the number (percentage) of patients. P values for continuous variables correspond to analysis of variances. P values for categorical variables with fewer than two patients in a given category correspond to Fisher's exact test. P values for categorical variables with at least two patients correspond to Pearson's chi-square tests. Data management and analyses were performed with STATA/SE statistical software, version 13 (Stata Corp).
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Mutations in cfDNA
To validate liquid biopsies in OPSCC patients, we sought to isolate tumor DNA and cfDNA from blood samples obtained from HNSCC patients and matched them to their corresponding tumor samples. In the current study, 22 patients with advanced-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx were selected. As shown in Table 2, there were no statistically significant differences in patient demographics such as age at diagnosis, race, gender, smoking status, and alcohol between disease-free and nonresponders groups. We also evaluated the viral status within the cohort and the percentage of nonresponder was different between HPV-positive and HPV-negative groups. Consistent with TCGA data, more nonresponders were observed in the HPVnegative group than that in the HPV-positive group (Table 2). Additionally, the tumor characteristics such as primary site, tumor, and nodal stage were also non-significant between the two groups (Table 2).
3.2 | Identification of mutations in tumor
We used the panel to prepare the sequencing library for all tumor tissue and matched plasma DNA samples. The quality of sequencing data was evaluated by FastQC and coverage analysis was performed by BGW. The average sequencing depth for 22 tissue DNA samples is over 1600. The average percentage of aligned reads on target of all tissue DNA samples was greater than 95%. The base coverage uniformity at 0.2 ranged from 93% to 98% with a mean of 96. The mean sequencing depth for matched 22 cfDNA samples were over 12 000. The average percentage of aligned reads on the target of cfDNA samples was 90.5%. The mean base coverage uniformity at 0.2 was 92%.
The sequencing data from 22 tissue samples were analyzed with BGW and verified by Genialis's Workflow for Swift Biosciences's Accel-Amplicon Panels. Both germline and somatic mutations determined in the tumor tissue samples are presented in Table 3. A total of 12 patients with nonsynonymous somatic mutations were determined among 22 patients. The most frequently occurred somatic mutant gene was TP53, which was detected in nine patients. Among nine patients, one was an HPV-positive disease-free, two were HPV-

negative disease-free, and six were HPV-negative nonresponders. There was a significant difference in the TP53 mutation distribution between HPV-positive and HPV-negative group (P = .0075 by Fisher's exact test). Somatic mutant FBXW7 (F-box and WD repeat domain containing-7) and PTEN was detected in two patients, respectively. The somatic mutated PIK3CA, HRAS, and CDKN2A were found in one patient for each gene. All these mutations have previously been reported in head and neck cancer and are consistent with the TCGA data. Among 12 patients, 3 patients have 2 or 3 somatic mutations. One HPV-negative nonresponder exhibited two somatic mutations in the TP53 gene, suggesting strengthening dysfunctions of the gene. Further, we detected polymorphisms or germline mutations in all 22 patients. The most frequent germline polymorphism genes in 22 patients were TP53 and kinase insert domain Receptor (KDR). The polymorphism of TP53 (P72R) occurred in 16 of 22 patients. The KDR polymorphism including Q472H and V297I was detected in 15 patients. Other observed germline mutations were HINF1A (11/ 22), PIK3CA (4/22), KIT (2/22), APC (2/22), and CDKN2A (2/22).
3.3 | Validation of liquid biopsies
To further validate liquid biopsies in OPSCC patients, we determined if somatic mutations could be detected in cfDNA. We sequenced cfDNA samples with the same library preparation as we did for tissue samples (Figure 1). To get rid of false-positive variants, we combined two variant callers, loFreg and BGW, to identify the variants with allele frequency over 1% according to instruction of Accel-Amplicon 56G Oncology Panel v2. We also excluded potential random errors and recurrent background noise by quadruple analyzing standard DNA samples. Among 22 cfDNA samples, somatic variants were detected in 11 samples. The variant number for each patient varied from 1 to 6 variants. The variant gene distribution over the patient's cfDNA samples is shown in Figure 2. The variants in EGFR genes were detected in six patients. Variants in TP53 and APC were detected in three patients, respectively. CDKN2A, Eerbb2, and PIK3CA were observed in two patients, respectively.
To investigate if cfDNA sequencing can detect the somatic mutations noted in the original tumor tissue, somatic mutations with allele frequency over 0.5% were identified by two callers and are listed in Table 4. Analysis of cfDNA revealed that five patients carried tumor sample bearded somatic mutations (Table 4), in which, four patients were HPV-negative nonresponders, and one was HPV-positive disease free. Among somatic mutations detected in tumor DNA samples, four TP53 mutants, two FBXW7 mutants, and one CDNK2A mutant were observed in cfDNA samples. The detected TP53 mutants were higher in HPV-negative patients than in HPV-positive patients (P = .0451 by one-tailed Fisher's exact test). The high incidence of TP53 mutants in cfDNA samples among HPV-negative patients was correlated with a high incidence of detected TP53 mutations in tissue samples of HPV-negative patients. It suggests that TP53 mutations could be an important characteristic of HPV-negative OPSCC patients.

survival than HPV-negative patients did (Figure 3B). Two death cases were reported in the HPV-positive group and six death cases occurred in the HPV-negative group. Therefore, the median survival in HPV-positive patients had undefined time compared to 25.05 months in HPV-negative patients. To see if the detection of tissue-matched ctDNA helps assess the disease progression and further treatment, we analyzed the disease-free survival of ctDNA-positive and ctDNA-negative patients (Figure 3C). The average disease-free survival was 12.3 months in ctDNA-positive patients and 37.0 months in ctDNA-negative patients. Interestingly, among four ctDNA-positive and HPV-negative patients, three patients recurred and one patient had 8 months of diseasefree follow-up.

4 | DISCUSSION
Personalized pharmacogenomics strategies for treating HNSCC patients require the detection and modulation of potent mutations that could predict response to therapy, affect drug responses and disease progression. While genotyping tumor tissues can help clinical decisions to a certain extent, conventional biopsies are temporally and spatially restricted, due to the brief insight they provide of a single region of heterogeneous tumor tissue. In addition, due to the nonexistence of consistent biomarkers currently, tissue biopsies involving cytopathology or histopathology have been the backbone for diagnosis and clinical management of head and neck cancers.

The ctDNA is a promising and emerging biomarker from significant prior studies. However, because ctDNA is extremely diluted in cfDNA by multiple factors. It has been a challenging work to true ctDNA at a low-frequency level. Several methods have been developed recently. For detection of unknown or new tumor-related variants in the clinic, the limit of detection of allele frequency of several commercial available cfDNA sequencing kit is set at 0.5% to 1% in order to keep the sensitivity and reduce the false-positive errors. In this study, cfDNA was sequenced with the Swift Biosciences's Accel-Amplicon 56G Oncology Panel v2. This kit is one of the first commercially available kits on the market for cfDNA sequencing. Though the kit is not molecular barcoding based, it has a limit of detection of allele frequency as low as 1% and overall detection sensitivity ranged 94% to 100%. The amplicon-based kit has high specificity with on-target reads over 95%. In the analysis of the tumor tissue bearded variants in cfDNA samples, we expanded the detection limit of allele frequency down to 0.5%. One reason to lower the detection limit is these variants were known variants in tumor tissue. Second, detected low-frequency variant with Accel-Amplicon 56G Oncology kit was verified for sample samples by ERASE-Seq (Elimination of Recurrent Artifacts and Stochastic Errors) method.16 For newly detected somatic variants in cfDNA only, we followed the instruction of the manufacturer of Accel-Amplicon 56G Oncology Panel v2. The limit of detection was set up at 1%. Considering a large number of potential false-positive variants at low-frequency level, the variant called by both Lofreg and BGW caller was picked up. These variants were further screened out for random and recurrent errors by quadruple analysis of standard DNA and available cfDNA samples.
We evaluated the ctDNA in OPSCC patient subgroups responding to therapy in comparison to nonresponders. While aspects of data from this study were in accordance with prior studies, indicating oncogenic mutations in TP53 and FBXW7 gene in tumor tissues,17 this study has distinctively identified correlations of the nonsynonymous mutations in ctDNA between disease-free and nonresponders groups in OPSCC. Among 11 nonresponders, matched mutations were detected in 4 patients suggesting a predictive factor for patients with the likelihood of recurrence. FBXW7 is a critical tumor suppressor and one of the most commonly deregulated ubiquitin-proteasome system proteins in human cancer. A wide variety of FBXW7 substrates have been identified including oncoproteins such as cyclin E, c-Myc, Mcl-1, mTOR, Jun, Notch and AURKA that undergo proteasome-mediated degradation.18 Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted the importance of FBXW7 in promoting mitotic cell death and help prevent premature escape from mitosis through mitotic slippage.19 Mitotic slippage is a process that can cause chemoresistance and tumor relapse. Therefore, further studies are warranted in identifying the role of FBXW7 in HNSCC and more importantly in non-responding patients. Interestingly, there exist a cross talk between the FBXW7 and p53 axis. FBXW7 interacts with p53 and leads to its polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, an increase in FBXW7 reduced the survival of patients with wild type p53 but not in patients carrying a p53 mutation or deletion suggesting that the tumorigenic effect of FBXW7 amplification is dependent on the degradation of a functional p53.

FBXW7 sensitizes cancer cells to radiation via stabilizing p53 leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.20 Furthermore, Tripathi et al demonstrated that TP53 mutant cell lines with unaltered FBXW7 status, when treated with doxorubicin to test their drug resistance attenuated its ability to form clones and to invade.21 Taken together, DNA damage, FBXW7-mediated degradation of p53 allows cell proliferation recovery and could have a potentially negative effect on the outcome of treatment of cancer disease.
4.1 | HPV-negative nonresponder mutations
While mutations in TP53 have been prominently associated with oncogenesis, the significant observation in this present study is the differential expression of these mutations between disease-free and nonresponders groups to therapy, with specific differentiation between HPV-positive and HPV-negative cases.22 As previously reported elsewhere, the HPV-negative patients showed a higher incidence of TP53 mutations as what HPV-positive patients did in this study. The noteworthy presence of the hotspot DNA-binding surface structural mutations TP53 R282W (48/1.74) and TP53 R273C (39/2.17) in the nonresponder group indicates the effects of a highly destabilized and dysfunctional p53 mechanism in this patient group. TP53 R282W causes substantial destabilization of the mutant protein with a loss of thermodynamic stability of more than >3 kcal/mol, consequently causing changes in the folding of the mutant protein, making it highly destabilized and nonfunctional. TP53 R273C mutation affects the DNA contact functionality of the p53 protein, as ARG-273 is vital in making key interactions with the phosphate backbone of the target DNA.23 Thus, this mutation leads to a critical loss of contact with the target DNA. The presence of the TP53 R282W (48/1.74) and TP53 R273C (39/2.17) mutational effects in the nonresponder groups could implicate the destabilized p53 mechanism to be a factor for therapeutic failure in some of these patients. Furthermore, the presence of the truncating mutation TP53 G325fs (27/0.62), which dysregulates p53 functionality to promote tumorigenesis instead of halting it, in the nonresponder groups implicates the consequence of a tumorigenic mutant p53 may be significant in the nonresponder groups in comparison to the responder group. Consistent with TCGA data, more nonresponders were observed in the HPV-negative group than in the HPV-positive group. Also, a substantially higher percentage of matched TP53 mutations occurred in 80% of the nonresponder patients. Furthermore, our study also determined TP53 mutations in 100% of the nonresponder HPV-negative HNSCC patients in our cohort.
Nevertheless, our studies suggest that ctDNA could potentially be a specific, noninvasive liquid biomarker to assess recurrence in advanced OPSCC patients, especially in HPV-negative patients.

abstract
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a complex hypersensitivity reaction in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis (CF), which is associated with bronchi colonized by the fungus Aspergillus species, most often Aspergillus fumigatus. ABPA is an important consideration for asthmatics that do not respond to asthma management or with recurrent chest infections and deteriorating lung function in children with cystic fibrosis. We present two cases of non CF bronchiectasis associated with ABPA who presented to our hospital with recurrent hospitalisations of undiagnosed aetiology.  2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction

2. Case report

Bronchiectasis is defined as the permanent dilatation of bronchi that results from a vicious cycle of inflammatory and infectious damage to the bronchial and bronchiolar walls [1]. While cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common cause of bronchiectasis in childhood in the developed world, non-CF bronchiectasis is may result from a number of other conditions that include tuberculosis and pertussis sequelae, immunodeficiency, connective tissue disorders and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis etc.[2, 3].
ABPA is characterized by type I and type III hypersensitivity reactions. Repeated episodes of bronchial obstruction, inflammation and mucoid impaction can lead to bronchiectasis, fibrosis and respiratory compromise. A number of cases of ABPA have been described in the Indian adult population, but only a handful has been reported in the paediatric age group.
Herein this article, we describe two children with prolonged respiratory illness necessitating recurrent hospitalisations and failure to respond to standard asthma management that were subsequently diagnosed with ABPA.

2.1. Case 1
The first case involves a six year old girl who was apparently well until the age of six months. Thereafter, she had started developing repeated episodes of cough and cold, respiratory distress with wheezing and was hospitalised on many occasions where she was treated with antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. Her symptoms responded only to recur again in a few weeks interval. There was no history of exposure to pets or home exposure to smokes. She was then referred to our institution for further evaluation and management for ongoing symptoms. There is no history of contact with tuberculosis.
On admission, the patient was noted to be pale, clubbed but not cyanosed with faltering weight gain (height and weight both below the 5th percentile). Examination of the chest revealed a pectus carinatum deformity (Fig. 1) and increased work of breathing (tachypneic at 32/min, bilateral wheeze and recessions). A Chest xray performed on admission revealed bilateral patchy opacities (Fig. 2). Her total leukocyte counts were elevated at 10,650/mm3 with 9% eosinophil in peripheral smear (absolute eosinophil count of 850/mm3). Serum IgE level was elevated at 1020 ng/mL. Sputum for acid fast tubercular bacilli and TB NAAT was negative. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed intra-bronchial mucus plugs. A high

resolution chest CT scan (HRCT) showed `tram track' bronchial dilatation and, `tree in bud appearance' confirming bronchiectasis (Fig. 3). Her sweat chloride estimation and CFTR gene mutation (for
DF508) for cystic fibrosis was reported as negative. Her skin prick
test to aspergillus (what reagent and what was the reading) serum IgE specific to aspergillus fumigatus were positive e. A diagnosis of ABPA was made and she was treated with oral prednisolone started at the dose of 0.75mg/kg/day over 2 week then gradually tapered over next 2 months and oral itraconazole 200 mg twice daily for 4 months. She responded favourably with progressive resolution of radiological opacities in serial chest x-rays.

2.2. Case 2
A seven year old boy presented with history of recurrent respiratory distress with wheezing since five years of age. There is a history of an allergic rash since two year of age that has often accompanied these episodes. Moreover, there was family history of atopy and asthma. In this case also there was no socioenvironmental cause of asthma exacerbation. On clinical examination there was clubbing and evidence of increased work of breathing (subcostal suction, bilateral wheeze and crepitations). A chest x-ray revealed bilateral patchy pulmonary opacities (Fig. 4). A transient improvement was recorded post bronchodilator therapy.
Investigations revealed a total leukocyte count of 13,500/mm3 with 6% eosinophil (absolute eosinophil count of 800/mm3). Serum IgE level was elevated at 2500ng/ml. Tests were negative for tuberculosis. Sweat chloride estimation and CFTR gene mutation was negative thereby ruling out cystic fibrosis. HRCT chest showed changes suggestive of bronchiectasis, `signet ring sign' (Fig. 5). Skin

prick tests were positive for Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus versicolor. Serum IgE antibodies specific against Aspergillus fumigatus was found to be positive. As like the other patient, the patients responded favourably to treatment (oral corticosteroids alone of total 2 months duration). 3. Discussion
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a

characterized by a hypersensitivity reaction to antigens of the Aspergillus species (most frequently Aspergillus fumigatus). First described in 1952 by Hinson et al., the pathogenesis of ABPA is complex with both host immune and genetic factors being implicated [4]. For reasons unclear, colonization prompts vigorous antibody (IgE and IgG) and cell-mediated immune responses (type I, III, and IV hypersensitivity reactions to Aspergillus antigens, leading to a vicious cycle of inflammation and bronchial wall damage. Clinically, this leads to frequent exacerbations, recurrent disease activity and ultimately permanent airway damage with bronchiectasis. ABPA most commonly affects patients with asthma (1e2% of ABPA patients) or cystic fibrosis (5e15% of ABPA patients) [5]. ABPA should be suspected in asthmatic children of any age with frequent exacerbations and suboptimal response to asthma therapy. As ABPA is very rarely diagnosed, in patients without a history of asthma, no data on the incidence are available [6]. With the development of ABPA, children with asthma or CF typically worsens clinically and may present with a new onset or worsening cough or an increase in sputum production or wheezing. Haemoptysis may occur secondary to airway inflammation and bronchiectasis. Systemic symptoms of low-grade fever, malaise, and weight loss and growth failure are variably associated with ABPA.
Management is conservative and is heavily reliant on reducing the airway inflammation by oral corticosteroids for prolonged periods. Antifungal agents like Itraconazole are often added, especially in cases where oral corticosteroids are contraindicated or are ineffective alone.
The diagnosis of ABPA is based on clinical and immunologic reactivity to Aspergillus. Fumigatus. The minimal criteria required for the diagnosis of ABPA are mentioned in Table 1 [7]. The designation of ABPA-seropositive (ABPA-S) may be used to classify asthmatic patients who meet the required criteria but lack the proximal or central bronchiectasis (ABPA-CB).
Only a handful number of studies have reported of ABPA in children. About 15% of children with bronchial asthma fulfilled four or more criteria for the diagnosis of ABPA [8,9]. The youngest reported patient with ABPA was a 22-month-old toddler with peripheral blood eosinophilia, elevated total serum IgE level, serum precipitin against A fumigatus, and immediate and late skin reactivity to A fumigatus antigens [10]. Another case report by Gaur et all relates to a case of ABPA from the Indian subcontinent where a 4 year old female child presented with recurrent wheeze and growth failure [11] In a study from India done by Kumar et al. eighty children with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis were identified and 6 patients among them was diagnosed as ABPA [12]. All our cases presented with recurrent wheeze and growth failure, had a history suggestive of asthma and were negative for CF. Subsequently they were demonstrated as having bronchiectasis on HRCT. They had evidence of peripheral eosinophilia, elevated total IgE and skin prick test positivity to aspergillus fumigatus. The first case had an elevated serum IgE specific to aspergillus whilst the later had an elevated serum precipitins to aspergillus. Both responded

Indian children. A high index of suspicion is required to investigate suboptimal response to asthma therapy. A prompt evaluation of failure to respond asthma coupled with proper anti-inflammatory and antifungal therapy can prevent from permanent destruction of airways with long term morbidity.

abstract
The sodium-activated potassium channels Slick (Slo2.1, KCNT2) and Slack (Slo2.2, KCNT1) are paralogous channels of the Slo family of high-conductance potassium channels. Slick and Slack channels are widely distributed in the mammalian CNS and they play a role in slow afterhyperpolarization, generation of depolarizing afterpotentials and in setting and stabilizing the resting potential. In the present study we used a combined approach of (co)-immunoprecipitation studies, Western blot analysis, double immunofluorescence and mass spectrometric sequencing in order to investigate protein-protein interactions of the Slick and Slack channels. The data strongly suggest that Slick and Slack channels co-assemble into identical cellular complexes. Double immunofluorescence experiments revealed that Slick and Slack channels co-localize in distinct mouse brain regions. Moreover, we identified the small cytoplasmic protein beta-synuclein and the transmembrane protein 263 (TMEM 263) as novel interaction partners of both, native Slick and Slack channels. In addition, the inactive dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP 10) and the synapse associated protein 102 (SAP 102) were identified as constituents of the native Slick and Slack channel complexes in the mouse brain. This study presents new insights into protein-protein interactions of native Slick and Slack channels in the mouse brain.

1. Introduction
The sodium-activated potassium channels Slick (sequence like an intermediate potassium channel, Slo2.1, KCNT2) and Slack (sequence like a calcium-activated potassium channel, Slo2.2, KCNT1) are structurally highly related and belong to the high-conductance potassium channels of the Slo family. Slick and Slack channels are widely distributed in the rat brain with partial overlap in their expression patterns [1,2]. In neurons, sodium-activated potassium channels are involved in adapting the firing pattern of neurons, in the generation of the slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) and depolarizing afterpotentials (DAP) and in stabilization and setting of the resting membrane potential [3-8]. The pore-forming alpha subunits of Slick and Slack channels are assembling into tetrameric

channels [9,10]. Alpha subunits of Slick and Slack channels are composed of an intracellular N-terminus, six membrane spanning domains, and a long intracellular C-terminus harboring various functional domains [9,10].
Native sodium-activated potassium channels are high-conductance outward rectifying potassium channels that are activated upon sodium-influx [11]. Heterologously expressed Slick and Slack channels resemble most of the biophysical properties of native sodium-activated potassium currents. Nonetheless, there are some discrepancies regarding their unitary conductance, sensitivity to internal sodium ions, subconductance states and open probabilities of the channels as well as rundown in excised patches. Such discrepancies were not only observed when comparing heterologously expressed Slick and Slack channels with native currents. In addition, biophysical properties of native sodium-activated potassium currents varied depending on the brain region and/or the cell type examined [11,12]. Such discrepancies might possibly reflect different isoforms of the underlying channels or channels associating with different endogenous factors and/or with several (regulatory) proteins.
While for the Slick channel no isoforms have been described,

five different Slack channel isoforms were identified so far. The Slack channel isoforms only differ in their N-terminal region. The physiological relevance of these Slack channel isoforms has not been investigated yet [13], and most studies exploring various aspects of the Slack channels were analyzing the so-called Slack-B isoform.
Slick and Slack channel diversity may be further increased by the formation of heteromeric Slick and Slack channels. A previous study provided first evidence that Slick alpha-subunits are forming heteromeric channels with Slack-B alpha-subunits in the rat brain. Heterologously expressed Slick/Slack heteromeric channels were shown to have biophysical properties distinct from those of homomeric Slick and Slack channels [14]. The BK channel (big conductance calcium-activated potassium channel) is another potassium channel that is structurally highly related to Slick and Slack channels and thus dedicated to the same family of potassium channels (Slo family). In vitro studies revealed that BK channel alpha subunits do associate with Slack subunits, thereby forming heteromeric potassium channels. However, the existence of such channel complexes has never been proven in vivo [15].
There is growing evidence that Slick and Slack channel activity may be regulated by several cellular signaling pathways, including activation of G-protein coupled receptors linked to activation of protein kinase C (PKC) or protein kinase A (PKA) and by direct phosphorylation by these signaling proteins [14,16-18]. Channel activity and gating may also be regulated by binding of endogenous signaling factors to the C-terminal tail of the channel, like NAD [19], PIP2 [20] and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) [21,22] as well as by small changes in cell volume [23].
Moreover, recent studies were suggesting that the Slack channel might interact with the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD 95) [24], FMRP [21] and with Glu2/3 subunits of the AMPA receptor [25].
In the present study we aimed to provide new insights into protein-protein interactions of the Slick and Slack channels in mouse brain. In order to address this issue, we performed double immunofluorescence and (co-)immunoprecipitation studies followed by Western blot analysis and mass spectrometric sequencing. Here we report Slick and Slack channels co-assemble into protein complexes in native mouse fore- and midbrain purified synaptic vesicle plasma membranes. Moreover, we provide first evidence for potential novel interaction partners of native Slick and Slack channels.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Animals
C57BL/6J mice were housed and handled in accordance with the guidelines with Austrian law which is in line with the directive of the European Union (2010/63/EU) for the use of laboratory animals. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Austrian Animal Experimentation Ethics Board in compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes. Every effort was taken to minimize the number and suffering of animals used.
2.2. Preparation of purified synaptic plasma membrane vesicles from mouse fore- and midbrain
Preparation of purified synaptic plasma membrane vesicles was performed according to [26]. In brief, 30 male and female C57BL/6J mice were killed by cervical dislocation and fore- and midbrain was excised. Tissue was homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer (320 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM

phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, PMSF) supplemented with protease inhibitors (complete tablets, Roche). Subsequently, homogenized fore- and midbrain tissue was separated on 7.5%/10% Ficoll gradient. Intact synaptosomes were lysed in 5 mM Tris-HCl supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysed synaptosomes were spun at 125,000  g for 1 h at 4 캜. Purified synaptic plasma membranes were resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at  80 캜.
2.3. Solubilization of membrane protein
Purified synaptic plasma membrane vesicles from mouse foreand midbrain were incubated for 30 min at 4 캜 in solubilization buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM
PMSF, 2 M leupeptin (Sigma-Aldrich), 1.5 M aprotinin (SigmaAldrich), 0.15 M pepstatin (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.9% n-dodecyl--D-
maltoside (Calbiochem)) in a protein:detergent ratio of 1:9). Thereafter, soluble protein fraction was separated from unsoluble protein fraction by high-speed centrifugation at 105,000  g for 30 min. Solubilization efficiency was controlled in Western blot analysis. Solubilized protein fraction was used for subsequent immunoprecipitation experiments.
2.4. Immunoprecipitation
Slick and Slack channel specific antibodies were immobilized and cross-linked onto dynabeads protein G (Life Technologies) following manufacture's guidelines and incubated with n-dodecyl-
-D-maltoside (Calbiochem) solubilized synaptic plasma mem-
branes derived from mouse fore- and midbrain overnight at 4 캜. For each experiment, 40 mg of either anti-Slick (clone N11/33, Neuromab) or anti-Slack (clone N3/26, Neuromab) channel antibody was used and 2 mg of synaptic plasma membranes served as starting material for solubilization. Immunoprecipitation experiments using a non-immune antibody of the same IgG subtype raised in chicken (MABC002, Chemicon, Millipore) served as negative control and were run in parallel. Unbound material was removed and collected (flow through). Affinity-purified protein complexes were eluted with Laemmli buffer (reducing agent added after elution). Resulting eluates were analyzed by Western blot and/or by mass spectrometric sequencing.
2.5. Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as described earlier [26]. In brief, 20 mg of protein samples (starting material, solubilized and unsolubilized protein fractions, and flow through) or 2.5% or 20% of eluates were separated by 4-15% (precasted TGX gel, Biorad) and transferred onto PVDF-membranes. Membranes were blocked in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween-20 (Roth) and 3% bovine serum albumin (Roth) for 1 h. Subsequently, membranes were incubated in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, 3% bovine serum albumin and either mouse monoclonal anti-Slick (1:1000, IgG1, clone N11/33, NeuroMab), mouse monoclonal anti-Slack (1:3000, IgG1, clone N3/26, NeuroMab), mouse polyclonal anti-beta-synuclein (1:100, abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-DPP 10 (1:500, abcam) or mouse monoclonal antiSAP 102 (1:2000, IgG1, clone N19/2, Biolegend) antibody for 2.5 h at room temperature. HRP-labeld goat anti-mouse IgG1 (1:100,000, Life Technologies), goat anti-mouse IgG (1:75,000, Dako) or goat anti-rabbit (1:75,000, Dako) were used as secondary antibodies. Western blots were developed using chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore) and subsequently PVDF-membranes were incubated with Amersham hyper film.

2.6. Double immunofluorescence
C57BL/6J mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and brains were removed immediately. Brains were snap-frozen in prechilled 50 캜 2-methylbutane (Roth) and cut into coronal 8 mm sections using a cryostat. Sections were thaw mounted onto poly-lysine coated slides (Thermo Scientific). Brain sections were fixed in 1% para-formaldehyde (PFA, Merck) for 5 min at 4 캜. After washing slices in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100 (Roth) 3 times for 5 min, slices were blocked in the same solution additionally containing 2% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. For double immunofluorescence, mouse monoclonal anti-Slick (clone N11/33, Neuromab) and anti-Slack channel antibodies (clone N3/ 26, Neuromab) were directly labeled with Alexa Fluor-488 or Alexa Fluor-594 using the antibody labeling kit from Molecular Probes (A20181 and A20185; Life Technologies). Sections (n 6) were incubated with directly labeled primary antibodies diluted (both 1:200) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100 (Roth) overnight at room temperature. On the next day, brain slices were washed 3 times for 10 min and counterstained with 0.03 mg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dilactate (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at room temperature. Thereafter, slices were washed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100 3 times for 10 min and mounted in hard set mounting medium (Vectashield). Confocal imaging was performed using LSM 700 (Zeiss) microscope and ZEN software.
Fluorescence intensity linescan profile was performed using image J software (rel. 1.45) by plotting fluorescence intensity (gray values) versus distance (pixels). Images were split into corresponding color channels (green: Slick channel-Alexa 488, red: Slack channel-Alexa 594). Intensity plots were extracted using identical coordinates and calculated in Excel.

were excised from gel and digested with trypsin from porcine pancreas (Sigma-Aldrich, Vienna, Austria) as previously described [27]. Tryptic digests were analyzed using an UltiMate 3000 nanoHPLC system (Thermo Scientific, Germering, Germany) coupled to a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a Nanospray Flex ionization source. The peptides were separated on a homemade fritless fused-silica microcapillary column (75 mm i.d.  280 mm o.d.  10 cm length) packed with 3 mm reversed-phase C18 material (Reprosil). Solvent for HPLC were 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in 85% acetonitrile (solvent B). The gradient profile was as follows: 0- 2 min, 4% B; 2-55 min, 4-50% B; 55-60 min, 50-100% B, and 60- 65 min, 100% B. The flow rate was 250 nL/min.
The Q Exacitve Plus mass spectrometer was operating in the data dependent mode selecting the top 12 most abundant isotope patterns with charge 41 from the survey scan with an isolation window of 1.6 mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). Survey full scan MS spectra were acquired from 300 to 1750m/z at a resolution of 70,000 with a maximum injection time (IT) of 120 ms, and automatic gain control (AGC) target 1e6. The selected isotope patterns were fragmented by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with normalized collision energy of 25 at a resolution of 17,000 with a maximum IT of 120 ms, and AGC target 5e5.
Data Analysis was performed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4.1.14 (Thermo Scientific) with search engine Sequest. The raw files were searched against the mus musculus database (167,940 entries) extracted from the NCBInr database released on June 2, 2014. Precursor and fragment mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively, and up to two missed cleavages were allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine, and oxidation of methionine were set as variable modifications. Peptide identifications were filtered at 1% false discovery rate.

2.7. Mass spectrometric sequencing
For mass spectrometric sequencing, eluates obtained from immunoprecipitation experiments were run on SDS-PAGE minigels and stained with Coomassie blue R250 (Biorad). Protein bands

experiments using a non-immune antibody of the same IgG subtype were run in parallel. In total 3 individual experiments per antibody used served for data evaluation. Proteins were only considered as specific if they were detected in at least two out of three individual experiments, and if they were not detected in any of the control experiments. In addition, only proteins of which at least two unique peptides were detected were considered specific.
2.9. Protein alignments, creation of percent identity matrix and topology prediction of transmembrane protein 263 (TMEM 263)
Protein sequences of different species were obtained from Pubmed. Alignments and creation of percent identity matrix were performed using Clustal Omega (rel. 1.2.1) with default settings. Topology of mouse TMEM 263 was analyzed using the web based protein structure prediction program TMHMM server (rel. 2.0).

3. Results
3.1. Interaction of Slick and Slick channels in mouse brain
To determine a possible interaction of Slick and Slack channels in mouse fore- and midbrain, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments followed by Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation studies were performed using mouse fore- and midbrain purified synaptic plasma membranes solubilized with dodecyl-maltoside (DDM). DDM is a nonionic detergent allowing solubilization of integral membrane proteins and is expected to preserve the native molecular environment of the ion channels. Solubilization efficiency was evaluated by Western blot analysis and was between 40% and 60% of total Slick and Slack protein (Fig. 1). The Slick channel-

specific antibody resulted in quantitative precipitation of Slick protein, while the Slack channel-specific antibody precipitated about 40-50% of solubilized Slack protein. After having established a reliable and reproducible immunoprecipitation protocol, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies using the same antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that the anti-Slick antibody co-purified Slack protein, and conversely, using the Slack channel-specific antibody we co-immunoprecipitated Slick protein. These results suggest that Slick and Slack channels might interact in a cellular complex in mouse fore- and midbrain.
3.2. CO-localization of Slick and Slack channels in selected moue brain regions
To further investigate a possible interaction of Slick and Slack channels in mouse brain, we performed double-immunofluorescence labeling experiments on mouse brain for both ion channels (n 6). Since both antibodies used were of the same IgGsubtype, we directly labeled them in order to be capable to perform double immunofluorescence stainings with Alexa-flour 488 (anti-Slick) and Alexa-fluor 594 (anti-Slack). Previous studies were suggesting that there is a partial overlap in the distribution pattern of Slick and Slack channels in rat brain, e.g. in the oculomotor and red nucleus [1,2,14]. Thus, we have chosen these nuclei as an example for channel co-localization and performed double immunofluorescence stainings in these nuclei of the mouse brain (shown in Fig. 2). Our experiments revealed strong immunostaining for both, Slick and Slack channels in neuronal cell bodies of both nuclei. Fluorescence signal was strongest at the plasma membrane, but was also evident in the cytoplasm. Taken together, these experiments indicated co-localization of Slick and Slack channels at the plasma membranes of neuronal cell bodies of both nuclei.

analysis
After having established that Slick and Slack channels may colocalize in the same cellular compartment and that they might potentially interact in a cellular complex, we next asked whether additional novel proteins might form complexes with native Slick and Slack channels. In order to address this issue we performed immunoprecipitation experiments as described before and combined them with mass spectrometric sequencing of immunopurified proteins. Because of current lack of Slick and Slack channel knock-out animals, co-immunoprecipitation experiments with a non-immune antibody of an identical IgG subtype run in parallel served as specificity control. In total, three individual experiments per antibody used served for data evaluation. Proteins were only considered as specific if they were detected in at least two out of three individual experiments and if they were not detected in any of the control experiments. In addition, only those proteins were considered as specific, of which at least two unique peptides were detected. Tables 1 and 2 are providing detailed information on the collected data.
This stringent validation criteria applied to our mass-spectrometry sequencing data allowed us to identify a number of high-

confident interaction partners of native Slick and Slack channels. This approach enabled the isolation of Slack protein by an anti-Slick antibody and vice versa, strongly supporting our Western blot data. Interestingly, using the anti-Slick antibody we detected unique peptide sequences specific for the N-terminus of the so-called SlackB isoform, one out of five previously described Slack channel isoforms, that are all differing in their N-terminal sequence [13].
In addition, we identified the small cytoplasmic protein betasynuclein and the transmembrane protein 263 (TMEM 263) as novel potential interaction partners of both, Slick and Slack channels (Tables 1 and 2). As of today, little is known about TMEM 263. Thus, we conducted protein sequence alignments of TMEM 263 and additionally, we created a percent identity matrix to predict inter-relatedness of the protein deriving from different species. Sequence alignment using Clustal Omega 2.1 demonstrated that TMEM 263 is highly conserved among species, indicating a substantial role of this protein in different vertebrates (Fig. 3). Human TMEM 263 shares over 96% amino acid sequence identity to mouse and rat TMEM 263, and approximately 74% to zebrafish, 77% to chicken and almost 90% to Xenopus spp. We were also interested in the possible membrane topology of TMEM 263.

Immunoprecipitation (IP) using DDM-solubilized mouse foreand midbrain membranes using anti-Slick or anti-Slack channel antibodies. 20% of eluted protein fraction of both, Slick channel and Slack channel IPs were used for Western blots. Staining with antibodies specific for beta-synuclein (predicted molecular weight 14 kDa), DPP 10 (predicted molecular weight 91 kDa) and SAP 102 (predicted molecular weight 102 kDa) resulted in bands which corresponded well to the predicted molecular weight of the individual proteins.
2.0-prediction of transmembrane helices in proteins) suggest that this protein consists of two membrane-spanning domains, an intracellular N- and C-terminus and an extracellular loop (indicated in Fig. 3). The protein has a predicted molecular weight of 9.3 kDa.
Interestingly, we detected the integral membrane protein inactive dipeptidyl-peptidase 10 (DPP 10) and the membrane-associated protein synapse associated protein 102 (SAP 102 or disks large homolog 3, DLG 3) as potential novel interaction partners of the Slick channel (Table 1).
In order to validate our findings obtained from mass spectrometric sequencing, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments followed by Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for the potential novel interaction partners. Unfortunately, suitableTMEM 263 specific antibodies were not available. However, both, Slick and Slack channel immunoprecipitation experiments resulted in co-purification of beta-synculein, DPP 10 as well as SAP 102 (shown in Fig. 4). These results are strongly supporting our data obtained from mass spectrometric sequencing. Moreover, in contrast to our data obtained by mass spectrometric sequencing, our Western blot data suggest that the Slack channel is interacting with DPP 10 and SAP 102. Taken together, our results indicate that Slick and Slack channels co-assemble into protein complexes together with beta-synuclein, TMEM 263, DPP 10 and SAP 102 in the mouse fore-and midbrain.
4. Discussion
In the present study we used a combined approach of doubleimmunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation studies, Western blot analysis and mass spectrometric sequencing in order to investigate protein--protein interactions of the native Slick and Slack channels. Our data strongly suggest that Slick and Slack channels are interacting in mouse fore- and midbrain. Moreover, we identified potential new interaction partners of Slick and Slack channels.
In a previous work it was shown that Slick and Slack channels are capable of forming heterotetrameres in vitro with unique biophysical properties. Further, Slick channels have been co-purified from solubilized rat olfactory bulb and brainstem using a Slack-B specific antibody [14]. This Slack channel isoform was found to interact with Slick channels [14]. In this study we have confirmed Slick channel as an interaction partner of Slack-B isoform in mouse brain, indicating that heteromerization of Slick and Slack channels might occur also in this species.
Moreover, in vitro studies suggest that BK channel alpha-

subunits are capable to form heteromeric channels with Slack channel alpha-subunits with distinct biophysical and pharmacological properties. However, the existence of such channel complexes has never been proven in vivo [15]. Performing immunoprecipitation studies using a Slack channel specific antibody followed by mass spectrometric sequencing we did not identify the BK channel alpha subunit interacting with Slack channel in mouse fore- and midbrain.
Previous studies focusing on possible protein-protein interactions of the Slack channel in brain have shown that this channel is interacting with the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD 95) [24], fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) [21] and with Glu2/3 subunits of the AMPA receptor [25]. Following our experimental approach we did not identify these proteins as potential interaction partners of the Slack channel. Different solubilization protocols applied, use of different species (mouse vs. rat) as well as the use of different membrane fractions and antibodies (e.g. PSD 95and Glu2/3-specific antibodies) in these studies might serve as an explanation.
Using a combination of immunoprecipitation experiments, mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis we identified, for the first time, inactive dipeptidyl-peptidase 10 (DPP 10), synapse associated protein 102 (SAP 102) and beta-synuclein as potential novel interaction partners both, Slick and Slack channels. While Western blotting was capable to detect all three proteins being interacting with Slick and Slack channels, mass spectrometric sequencing failed to directly identify two of these partners (DPP 10 and SAP 102) to be associated with Slack channels. However, they were clearly identified together with Slick channel subunits. This discrepancy might solely reflect different sensitivities of both methods applied. The transmembrane protein 263 (TMEM 263) was identified through mass spectrometric sequencing as novel potential interaction partner of both, Slick and Slack channels. Due to current lack of suitable TMEM 263 specific antibodies, we could not validate this interaction in Western blots.
What functional implications could such an association on the molecular properties of Slick and Slack channels have? We found both potassium channels interacting with TMEM 263. Alignment of protein sequences deriving from different species demonstrated that TMEM 263 is highly conserved, indicating a substantial role of this protein in different vertebrates. Protein structure prediction software suggests that this protein consists of two membranespanning domains, an intracellular N- and C-terminus and an extracellular loop. Interestingly, this topological arrangement shares homologies to auxiliary beta-subunits of the aforementioned BKchannel. As to whether TMEM 263 confers properties similar to the BK channel beta-subunit to Slick and Slack channels remains to be determined.
We also identified beta-synuclein interacting with both, Slick and Slack channels. Beta-synuclein has been implicated to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and moreover, in synaptic vesicle endocytosis [28]. This small cytoplasmic protein is detected only in vertebrates and expressed predominately in presynaptic nerve terminals [29].
In addition, we co-purified DPP 10 with both, Slick and Slack channels. DPP 10 was previously shown to associate with alpha subunits of the voltage-gated potassium channels of the Kv4 family (Kv4.1-4.3). This assembly leads to an altered surface expression and changes of biophysical properties of the channel complexes in vitro [30,31]. Kv4 channels interact with DPP 10 via their S1-S2 segments, a structure also being present in Slick and Slack potassium channels [32].
Moreover, we identified SAP 102 as a high-confident interaction partner of the Slick and Slack channels. SAP 102 is a scaffolding protein typically present at postsynaptic densities. It is involved in trafficking and anchoring of distinct types of glutamate

receptors [33] and is associated with inwardly rectifying potassium channels of the Kir2.x family in rat brain [34]. Interactions of SAP 102 and Kir2.x channels are mediated through a PDZ domain of SAP 102 and the C-terminal PDZ class I binding motif of Kir2.x channels [34]. This well preserved PDZ binding motif is also present at the C-terminus of Slick and Slack channels [9,15,24].
In the present study we offer new insights in the nano-environment of Slick and Slack channels. Our data presented here could provide the basis for future studies systematically exploring possible functions of newly identified Slick and Slack channel interaction partners. In the future, potential influences of the interaction partners on biophysical or pharmacological properties as well as on channel trafficking or surface expression could be systematically explored by the use of heterologous expression systems. Interaction of some of the newly identified interacting proteins might possibly partly explain the observed discrepancies in the biophysical properties between Slick and Slack channels expressed in heterologous expression systems and native sodiumactivated potassium channels as well as previously described heterogeneity of native sodium-activated potassium currents in vivo.

ABSTRACT
Background: Alcohol intake is a well-known lifestyle risk factor for CRC, and an increasing number of studies have revealed that alcohol intake is also tightly associated with CRC metastasis. However, the effect of alcohol on CRC metastasis and its underlying mechanism remain unclear. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed to investigate the characteristics of patients with alcohol-related CRC. The effects of ethanol on the biological behaviours of CRC cells were assessed through in vivo and in vitro assays using the Lieber-DeCarli ethanol liquid diet and ethanol, respectively. The ethanolmediated signalling pathway and downstream factors were screened through ELISA, western blot, immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation. Findings: Most patients with alcohol-related CRC, particularly those with tumour metastasis, were characterized by a notably higher circulating ethanol level and a lower systemic acetaldehyde level. Moreover, CRC cells accumulated in ethanol, but not acetaldehyde, to notably higher levels compared with adjacent normal
cells. Alcohol intake significantly promoted CRC metastasis via the ethanol-mediated TGF-b/Smad/Snail axis,
and ethanol induced the cytoplasmic mislocalization of RUNX3 and further promoted the aggressiveness of CRC by targeting Snail. Pirfenidone (PFD) significantly eliminated the effects of ethanol on CRC metastasis by
specifically blocking TGF-b signalling. Interpretation: Alcohol intake plays a vital role in CRC metastasis via the ethanol-mediated TGF-b/RUNX3/
Snail axis, and PFD might be a novel therapeutic management strategy for CRC.  2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license. (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)

1. Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1]. Tumour metastasis is often the direct reason for the poor prognosis of most patients with CRC [2,3]. However, the mechanisms

underlying CRC incidence and metastasis remain unclear because a multistep cascade of events is stimulated by various risk factors, including age, genetic mutation, inflammation, gut microflora composition, family history and harmful lifestyle habits [4,5]. Intriguingly, recent studies have shown a significantly higher incidence of CRC in highly developed countries [6,7]. Therefore, we hypothesized that environmental and lifestyle factors might exert a notably more crucial effect on CRC than previously suspected.
Alcohol consumption is very common in developed countries and has been confirmed to be an important risk factor for CRC, and particularly strong associations have been obtained with chronic and moderate to heavy alcohol intake [4]. Moreover, increasing numbers of epidemiological studies have revealed that alcohol consumption is also closely related to metastasis in patients with CRC, and this association was identified as the primary reason for the poor outcomes

Research in context
Evidence e prior to this study
An increasing numbers of studies have revealed that alcohol consumption is tightly associated with tumour metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC), but its effect and underlying mechanism remain unclear. Recent studies on other diseases have demonstrated that ethanol significantly promotes the expression of
TGF-b1, and the activation of this factor plays a vital role in the
development and progression of multiple types of cancers. Although both ethanol and its metabolic product acetaldehyde are the major carcinogens in alcohol, the contribution and mechanical role of ethanol itself in alcohol-related CRC remain unknown.
Added value of this study
Alcohol intake significantly promotes tumour metastasis in CRC in vivo, and ethanol itself plays a vital role in promoting the
metastasis of alcohol-related CRC via the TGF-b/RUNX3/Snail
axis. In addition, ethanol activates this axis by inducing the upre-
gulation of TGF-b1 and the cytoplasmic mislocalization of
RUNX3. Pirfenidone (PFD) significantly eliminates the ethanolinduced promotion of the aggressiveness of CRC cells by block-
ing TGF-b signalling.
Implications of all available evidence
Alcohol intake is an important risk factor for CRC progression from early to advanced stages, and ethanol itself plays a vital role in the development and progression of alcohol-related CRC. PFD might be a novel therapeutic management strategy for CRC.
observed in these patients [8,9]. Due to the difficulty in detecting CRC at an early stage [10], it was conceivable to conclude that most CRC patients would not change their lifestyles until obvious symptoms and/or signs were detected. Thus, alcohol intake is also considered to play a vital role in accelerating the progression of early CRC.
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has declared that ethanol and acetaldehyde are the major carcinogens associated with alcohol intake [1113], but the mechanisms underlying the effects of ethanol itself on the development and progression of alcohol-related CRC remain unknown. Interestingly, recent studies on other diseases have revealed that ethanol significantly increases
the expression of extracellular TGF-b1, which is a crucial trigger for the activation of TGF-b signalling and plays a vital role in the inci-
dence and metastasis of CRC [14,15]. Therefore, ethanol itself might play an important role in the tumour metastasis of alcohol-related
CRC via TGF-b signalling.
The present study aimed to investigate the effects of alcohol intake on CRC metastasis and the role of ethanol in alcohol-related tumour metastasis. Furthermore, our study might aid the development of novel therapeutic strategies for CRC.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Clinical population and tumour tissue samples
The clinical data used in this study originated from 200 patients diagnosed with primary CRC between January 2012 and December 2017 by the Department of Pathology at Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University in Guangdong, China. Two hundred healthy controls were randomly selected from the cohort of outpatients. The 45 pairs of CRC tissues with matched normal mucosa that were used for alcohol dehydrogenase 1C (ADH1C), alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B), acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), acetaldehyde

dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 1B1 (ALDH1B1) detection were also diagnosed by the Department of Pathology at Zhujiang Hospital. We restricted our analysis to population-based cases that were not selected based on family history. This study was approved by the Ethics Committees of Zhujiang Hospital and Southern Medical University, and all aspects of the study comply with the criteria set by the Declaration of Helsinki. All the CRC patients provided informed consent to participate in this study. The ADH and ALDH expression profiles of the CRC samples, including any relevant clinical information, were identified through a search of the GEO: GSE87211 dataset (n = 160).
2.2. Measurement of alcohol intake
The alcohol intake was self-reported by participants during the baseline survey conducted in 2017 involving telephone follow-up. The drinking frequency (times/day) was calculated by asking the participants their weekly intake of alcohol during the 12 months before the follow-up (for healthy people) or the CRC diagnosis (for patients). The patients who did not usually drink some alcohol at least once a week were asked to provide their monthly or annual alcohol intake. The participants were further asked questions regarding the types of beverage (beer, grape wine, rice wine, weak spirits with an alcohol content < 40%, and strong spirits with an alcohol content  40%), the amount of alcohol consumed in a typical drinking day and the experience of flushing after drinking. The level of alcohol intake was calculated as grams (g) of pure alcohol per week based on the beverage type, amount consumed and frequency, and the following assumptions were used for the alcohol content by volume (v/v) in China: beer, 4%; grape wine, 12%; rice wine, 15%; weak spirits, 38%; and strong spirits, 53% [16]. According to the overall mean alcohol intake, we defined a patient who had not consumed any alcohol during the 12 months before the follow-up or CRC diagnosis as an "abstainer" and a participant who drank more than 5 g/week (regardless of his/ her past drinking patterns) as a "drinker".
2.3. Cell culture and treatment
The colorectal normal epithelial cell line FHC (Cat# CRL-1831, RRID: CVCL_3688) and the cancer cell lines HT29 (Cat# HCT-38, RRID: CVCL_0320), HCT116 (Cat# CCL-247, RRID: CVCL_0291), LS174T (Cat# CL-188, RRID: CVCL_1384), SW480 (Cat# CCL-228, RRID: CVCL_0546), SW620 (Cat# CCL-227, RRID: CVCL_0547), and RKO (Cat# CRL-2577, RRID: CVCL_0504) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The normal liver cell line L-O2 (Cat# CX0157) was obtained from BOSTER (Wuhan, China). All the cells were maintained as previously described and authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) profiling after receipt. For use in this study, the cells were propagated for less than 6 months after resuscitation. These cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Cat# A1049101, Thermo Fisher Life Technologies Corporation; Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Cat# 10091130, Invitrogen, USA). Physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol (0, 100, and 200 mg/dl, which correspond to 0, 22, and 44 mM, respectively; Cat# 459844, Sigma, USA) were accurately maintained for 4872 h as previously indicated [17]. 4-Methylpyrazole (4-MP, 5 mM; Cat# HY-B0876, MedChemExpress, Shanghai, China) was used to inhibit the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase. The cells were also treated with pirfenidone (Cat# HY-B0673, MedChemExpress, Shang-
hai, China) and a TGF-b/Smad signalling inhibitor (Cat# SB-431542,
Selleck, USA) at the recommended concentration (0.5 mg/ml) for 4872 h. The RUNX3 vector with a nuclear localization sequence was purchased from GeneChem (Shanghai, China) and transfected using the lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Cat# L3000015, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).

2.4. Analysis of the blood ethanol concentration

3. Results

All Balb/c mice (aged 6 weeks) were treated with ethanol at 6 g/kg (by gavage, 32%, v/v solution). The blood alcohol concentrations were mea-
sured five times over 8 h (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h). For each sampling, 50 ml
of whole blood was collected in a heparinized tube and centrifuged at 1800  g for 5 min. The concentration of ethanol in serum was measured using an ethanol assay kit (Cat# KA4784, Abnova, USA). All experimental operations were performed in accordance with the instructions.
2.5. ADH activity assay
Total ADH activity was determined through the photometric method using an alcohol dehydrogenase assay kit purchased from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Cat# A083-11, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the reaction mixture contained reagent 1 (0.65 ml), reagent 2 (0.05 ml), reagent 3 (0.75 ml) and the cell sample (0.05 ml). A mixture of the probe with ddH2o instead of the cell sample was used as a control. The absorbence at 340 nm was measured immediately after mixing (A1) and again after 10 min of incubation at 37 캜 (A2). The activity of ADH was then computed using the following formula:
ADH activity  TestA2 퓾1事ControlA2 퓾1 6:22  0:5

2.6. Orthotopic xenograft colorectal cancer mouse model
The animals were fed the Lieber-DeCarli ethanol liquid diet (ethanol: 40 mg/ml) (Cat# TP4010A, TROPHIC Animal Feed High-Tech Co. LTD, China) for five days prior to cell injection. CT26 (Cat# CRL-2639, RRID: CVCL_7254, ATCC, USA) cells were suspended in fresh PBS at a
concentration of 1  106 cells/50 ml and aspirated using a fine needle.
Six-week-old Balb/c mice were anaesthetized and exposed to the caecum by laparotomy. In brief, a 0.51-cm-long small nick was made in the skin, and the abdominal wall musculature was lifted. The abdominal cavity was opened, and the caecum was isolated and covered by warm saline and sterile gauze to keep the caecum moist. The
cells (50 ml) were slowly injected into the caecal wall. The needle
was carefully removed, and the injection site was inspected to ensure no leakage. The caecum was then returned to the abdominal cavity, and the abdominal wall and skin were closed. Twenty days later, the mouse was sacrificed, and the orthotopic xenograft colorectal cancer masses were measured and harvested for further study. If the tumour mass was invisible, the full intestine was embedded to calculate the maximum tumour size under microscopy.
2.7. Statistical analysis
The data were analysed using SPSS version 19.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The clinical data were analysed using nonparametric
tests (Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney). Pearson's chi-squared (x2) test,
unpaired Student's t-test and paired t-test were used to evaluate the significance of the differences among different groups. All statistical tests were two-sided. The data are presented as the means  SEMs.
2.8. Additional methods and material
All other methods are described in the online supplementary materials and methods.

3.1. Most patients with alcohol-related CRC are characterized by a high circulating ethanol level
Our retrospective cohort study (n = 400, 200 healthy controls and 200 CRC patients) revealed that the proportion of CRC patients who consumed alcohol was significantly higher than that of healthy controls (control vs CRC = 42.5% vs 60.5%, Fig. 1A). Moreover, the frequency (control vs CRC = 0.294  0.337 per day vs 0.455  0.438 per day, Fig. 1B) and quantity (control vs CRC = 43.847 g  24.370 g vs 93.289 g  58.640 g) of alcohol intake (Fig. 1C) in patients with CRC were notably higher than those in the control subjects, which indicated that frequent and heavy alcohol intake is tightly associated with the incidence of CRC. Our study also found that subjects without flushing syndrome after alcohol intake in both the healthy and CRC groups were more likely to drink and had a higher risk of alcoholism (Fig. 1D). It is well known that a lack of flushing syndrome after drinking indicates strong acetaldehyde metabolic ability in the body and low acetaldehyde levels in tissues and the circulation [18]. Surprisingly, we found that the frequency and quantity of alcohol intake in alcohol-related CRC patients without flushing syndrome were substantially higher than those in the control subjects and patients with flushing syndrome (Fig. 1E and F). Accordingly, even with a high alcohol intake, most patients with alcohol-related CRC had low circulating levels of acetaldehyde, and thus, the guts of these patients might have only been exposed to these low acetaldehyde levels. A further in vivo study using mice revealed that the extent of circulating ethanol was primarily determined by the amount of alcohol consumed and that its duration was largely determined by the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, Fig. 1G). Therefore, the exposure of the gut to high circulating levels of ethanol, but not acetaldehyde, after alcohol consumption might contribute to alcohol-related CRC in most patients.
3.2. Alcohol intake promotes tumour metastasis in CRC by increasing the circulating ethanol level
Further study revealed that alcohol intake was tightly associated with tumour metastasis in CRC (Fig. 2A). The average amount of alcohol intake in patients with tumour metastasis was significantly higher than that in patients without metastasis (nmCRC vs mCRC = 59.845 g  32.547 g vs 111.070 g  61.733 g, Fig. 2B), which indicated that a higher alcohol intake promoted CRC metastasis. In addition, a higher proportion of patients without flushing syndrome was obtained in the subgroup of subjects with tumour metastasis compared with the subgroup of patients without metastasis (nmCRC vs mCRC = 82.3% vs 59.5%, Fig. 2C). Moreover, we also found that patients with tumour metastasis and no flushing syndrome consumed a substantially higher amount of alcohol than the other patients (Fig. 2D). Thus, most alcohol-related CRC patients with tumour metastasis exhibited a high circulating level of ethanol, but not acetaldehyde, in the gut.
To confirm the effect of alcohol intake on tumour metastasis in CRC, an in vivo study was performed using the Lieber-DeCarli ethanol liquid diet. The results revealed that orthotopic xenograft tumours formed in all the mice, but none of the mice in the control group developed liver metastasis (Fig. 2A) compared with four out of six mice in the alcohol-treated group (Fig. 2B), which indicated that alcohol intake significantly promoted CRC metastasis. Taken together, the results indicated that a high circulating level of ethanol in the gut resulting from alcohol intake significantly promoted tumour metastasis in CRC.
In addition, our study also revealed that the incidence of alcoholrelated CRC was associated with sex, which might be due to the prevalence of alcoholism in the male population. Moreover, we found

that alcohol intake only significantly increased the risk of right colon cancer. We also found that most patients with alcohol-related CRC had smoking habits, which might also be an important risk factor for CRC [5] (Supplementary Table 1).
3.3. Ethanol, but not acetaldehyde, might be the crucial factor accounting for the incidence and metastasis of most alcohol-related CRC
Previous studies have confirmed that the metabolic rates of ethanol and acetaldehyde are primarily determined by the expression of key alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) [19]. Thus, we further investigated the alterations in the metabolism of alcohol in CRC by detecting the expression of key ADHs (ADH1C and ADH1B) and ALDHs (ALDH2, ALDH1B1 and ALDH1B1) in CRC and matched normal tissues. This analysis revealed that the transcriptional levels of ADH1C and ADH1B were substantially decreased in CRC compared with adjacent normal tissues (Fig. 1F). Further study showed significant decreases in the transcriptional levels of ALDH2 and ALDH1A1 and an increased transcriptional level of ALDH1B1 in CRC tissues. However, the absolute difference in the transcriptional level of ALDH2 between CRC and adjacent normal tissues was low (normal vs CRC = 0.6893  0.0548 vs 0.6768  0.0540, Fig. 1H). Interestingly, ALDH2 is the major enzyme that breaks down most ethanol-derived acetaldehyde, whereas ALDH1A1, as well as ALDH1B1, contributes to acetaldehyde metabolism only if ALDH2 is inactivated [19]. Thus, no significant changes in acetaldehyde metabolism might be found between CRC and normal tissues. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ethanol, but not acetaldehyde, accumulates more easily in CRC cells than in adjacent normal epithelial cells.

3.4. Ethanol enhances the migration/invasion, motility and homing capacity of CRC cells
Our in vitro study revealed that the activity of ADH in all six CRC cell lines was notably weaker than that in the normal hepatic cell line L-O2, and particularly weak activity was detected in the SW480 and HCT116 cell lines, which presented up to a 157-fold decrease in activity (Fig. 3A). Consistent with the activity of ADH found in the above-mentioned cell lines, we also found that the transcriptional levels of ADH1C and ADH1B were significantly lower in the SW480 and HCT116 cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, 4-MP, a specific inhibitor of the activity of ADH, could not further inhibit the activity of ADH in both the SW480 and HCT116 cell lines, which indicated that both cells lines exhibited extremely weak ADH activity (Fig. 3B). We further investigated the biological effect of physiologically relevant concentrations (22 mM and 44 mM) of ethanol on CRC cells. Our study found that ethanol dose-independently promoted the migration/invasion and motility of SW480 and HCT116 cells, and this induction could not be further enhanced by 4-MP due to the already extremely weak ethanol metabolism in both cell lines (Fig. 3C픂, Supplementary Fig. S2). The in vivo study revealed that ethanol dose-independently promoted the formation of tumour nodules in the lungs compared with the controls, which indicated that ethanol promotes the homing capacity of cancer cells (Fig. 3F). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that ethanol plays an important role in promoting the migration/invasion of CRC cells.
3.5. Ethanol, but not acetaldehyde, promotes epithelial-mesenchymal
transition of CRC cells via the TGF-b/Smad/Snail axis
Consistent with the results from studies of other diseases [2023], we found that ethanol dose-dependently promoted

intracellular and extracellular TGF-b1 expression (Fig. 4A and C).
However, acetaldehyde intriguingly had the opposite effect on the
expression of TGF-b1 (Fig. 4B). Further study showed that ethanol
significantly promoted the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of Smad2 (Fig. 4C and D, Supplementary Fig. S3), which indicated the
activation of TGF-b1/Smad signalling [24]. Interestingly, we found
that SW480 and HCT116 cell lines exhibited significant higher levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) after treatment with eth-
anol at two different concentrations (Fig. 4E). Moreover, consistent
alteration of the EMT signature (E-cadherin, b-catenin, fibronectin,
N-cadherin and vimentin) was also found in both cell lines (Fig. 4C),
which indicated that ethanol might enhance the aggressiveness of
cancer cells by promoting EMT of CRC cells. Further study found that ethanol significantly promoted the expression of Snail (Fig. 4C), an
important downstream effector of TGF-b signalling and a trigger of
EMT [25,26]. In addition, the orthotopic xenograft CRC mouse model demonstrated that alcohol intake significantly increased the

expression and nuclear location of phosphorylated-Smad2 in vivo (Fig. 4F, Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). Taken together, the results indicated that the accumulation of ethanol, but not acetaldehyde, might be the primary reason accounting for the development and
progression of alcohol-related CRC through the activation of TGF-b
signalling.
3.6. TGF-b signalling plays a vital role in the ethanol-promoted
aggressiveness of CRC cells
In this study, we used TGF-b1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and a TGF-b/Smad signalling-specific inhibitor to confirm the role of TGFb1 and TGF-b/Smad signalling in the ethanol-enhanced aggres-
siveness of CRC cells. The inhibition experiments revealed that
decreasing the expression of TGF-b1 or blocking TGF-b/Smad signal-
ling significantly eliminated the ethanol-promoted migration/invasion of CRC cells (Fig. 5A and B, Supplementary Figs. S4A and S4B).

Consistent changes were also obtained in the analyses of the alter-
ation of the EMT signature (E-cadherin and vimentin) and TGF-b
(phosphorylated-Smad2 and Snail) signalling (Fig. 5C, Supplementary
Fig. S4C). These findings strongly suggest that TGF-b1 plays a crucial
role in the ethanol-enhanced aggressiveness of CRC cells via TGF-
b/Smad signalling.
Intriguingly, pirfenidone (PFD) is a newly developed clinical anti-
fibrotic drug that targets TGF-b signalling [27], but recent studies
revealed that this drug can significantly inhibit the metastasis of human lung carcinoma by reverting the EMT of cancer cells [28,29]. However, its effects on CRC remain unknown. Thus, PFD was used in this study to determine its effect on CRC cells and the crucial role of
ethanol-mediated TGF-b signalling in the aggressiveness of alcohol-
related CRC. The results showed that PFD significantly decreased the phosphorylation and nuclear location of Smad2 in CRC cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A) and significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration/invasion and motility of CRC cells in vitro (Supplementary Figs. S5B픓5E). Further study revealed that PFD significantly eliminated the ethanol-promoted migration/invasion and motility of CRC cells in vitro (Fig. 5D and E, Supplementary Figs. S6픓8). Consistent with these biological phenotypes, PFD also reversed the ethanol-mediated
alteration of the EMT signature (E-cadherin, b-catenin, fibronectin, N-cadherin and vimentin) and TGF-b (phosphorylated-Smad2 and
Snail) signalling (Fig. 5F, Supplementary Fig. S9). Additional immunofluorescence assays revealed consistent alterations in the EMT signatures (E-cadherin and vimentin, Fig. 5G, Supplementary Figs. S10 and S11). These findings not only further confirmed the important role of
TGF-b signalling in the ethanol-enhanced aggressiveness of CRC cells
but also revealed that PFD might be a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of CRC patients.
3.7. The ethanol-induced cytoplasmic mislocalization of RUNX3 further promotes the aggressiveness of CRC cells via EMT by targeting Snail
RUNX3 is a well-known cooperative factor for TGF-b signalling
but acts as a tumour suppressor in the development and progression of multiple types of cancers (30, 31). Interestingly, our study found a significant absence of nuclear RUNX3 after treatment with different concentrations of ethanol (Fig. 6A). Further immunoblot assays confirmed that ethanol significantly decreased the expression of RUNX3 in the nucleus but promoted its expression in the cytoplasm. In addition, an orthotopic xenograft CRC mouse model demonstrated that alcohol intake significantly induced the cytoplasmic mislocalization of RUNX3 in CRC cells in vivo (Fig. 6C, Supplementary Videos 3 and 4). It is well known that the cytoplasmic mislocalization of RUNX3 could eliminate the RUNX3-mediated inhibition of tumour progression [32]. Therefore, the ethanol-mediated cytoplasmic mislocalization of RUNX3 might be an important mechanism accounting for the promotion of CRC metastasis.
To clarify the role of RUNX3 in the metastasis of alcohol-related CRC, we recovered the nuclear expression of RUNX3 by constructing a RUNX3 vector with a nuclear localization sequence (NLS). Immunofluorescence and immunoblot assays were performed to confirm the transfection efficiency and nuclear localization of exogenous RUNX3 (Fig. 7A and D). Further studies found that nuclear RUNX3 overexpression significantly eliminated the ethanol-induced promotion of the migration/invasion abilities of both cell lines (Fig. 7B and C, Supplementary Figs. S13픓15). In addition, restoration of the nuclear expression of RUNX3 substantially reversed the ethanol-mediated alteration of Snail expression and the EMT signature. However, no significant difference in the expression of P21 was obtained after the restoration of nuclear RUNX3 expression (Fig. 7D, Supplementary
S16). P21 is another downstream effector of TGF-b signalling that is
tightly associated with cancer cell proliferation and anticancer drug resistance by inducing cell-cycle arrest [33]. Taken together, the findings indicate that the ethanol-induced cytoplasmic mislocalization of

RUNX3 further promotes the aggressiveness of CRC cells by targeting Snail.
3.8. Ethanol induces the cytoplasmic mislocalization of RUNX3 by enhancing the dissociation of the p-Smad2/3-RUNX3 complex
This study revealed that RUNX3 combines with the p-Smad2/3 complex to enter the nucleus and subsequently regulate the transcription of target genes [30]. Thus, we hypothesized that ethanol might induce the cytoplasmic localization of RUNX3 by promoting the dissociation of the phosphorylated-Smad2/3-RUNX3 and/or Smad2/3-RUNX3 complex. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that ethanol treatment significantly reduced the colocalization of RUNX3 and phosphorylated-Smad2 but not that of RUNX3 and Smad2 (Figs. 8A and B). Additional coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays also determined that ethanol significantly reduced the binding efficiency of RUNX3 and phosphorylated Smad2 without change that of RUNX3 and Smad2 (Fig. 8C). These findings strongly suggest that ethanol induces the cytoplasmic localization of RUNX3 by promoting the dissociation of the phosphorylated-Smad2/3/RUNX3 complex.
4. Discussion
Alcohol intake has generally been accepted as a common and legal lifestyle factor in many countries, particularly developed countries [34]. However, in 2012, based on a systematic review of evidence obtained from countries all over the world, the IARC drew the reliable conclusion that chronic and moderate to heavy alcohol intake is an important cause of cancer, including cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colorectum and female breast [35]. Our study revealed that alcohol intake not only significantly increases the risk of CRC but also is tightly associated with tumour metastasis, which is the primary cause of the poor outcomes observed in most CRC patients [36,37]. Although new effective indicators and detecting strategies for CRC have been developed over the past decade, the detection and diagnosis of CRC at an early stage remain difficult [10,38]. Thus, it is possible that most CRC patients with chronic alcohol intake might continue drinking until significant symptoms and/ or signs are detected. Further study confirmed that alcohol intake significantly promoted the migration/invasion of CRC cells via the etha-
nol-mediated TGF-b/RUNX3/Snail axis. Therefore, we hypothesized
that alcohol intake not only increases the risk of CRC but also plays a vital role in accelerating its progression from early to advanced stages.
Ethanol and acetaldehyde are two major carcinogens associated with alcohol intake, and the effects of alcohol on the development and progression of CRC are primarily determined by the duration and extent of exposure in the colorectum [1113]. Our study showed that most patients with alcohol-related CRC do not experience flushing syndrome after heavy alcohol intake, which indicates that their systemic level of acetaldehyde in the circulation and tissues was not substantially increased even after the consumption of a great amount of alcohol [19]. Because alcohol is absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract to the circulation system during ingestion [34], a patient with a heavy alcohol intake must have a notably high level of ethanol in his/her circulation after drinking, but the duration of this high level is determined by the capacity of the patient's body to break down alcohol [19]. In addition, most alcohol is absorbed into the circulation in the small intestine, and only some reaches the colorectum after ingestion [34]; thus, the ethanol level in colorectal tissue should be determined largely by the concentration of ethanol in the circulation. Taken together, the results indicated that an increased circulating level of ethanol in the colorectum is the major cause of the increased CRC incidence and metastasis detected in most patients with alcoholrelated CRC.

The effects of ethanol on colorectal cells were determined mainly by the metabolic rates of ethanol and its byproduct acetaldehyde. In humans, ADHs and ALDHs are the major enzymes that break down ethanol and acetaldehyde, respectively [19]. Humans have seven ADHs, namely, ADH1A, ADH1B, ADH1C, ADH4, ADH5, ADH6 and ADH7. It has been well demonstrated that ADH1B, ADH1C and ADH4 are the key ADHs responsible for most of the breakdown of ethanol [19]. Because ADH4 is almost exclusively expressed in the liver [19], the ethanol metabolism in colorectal cells was primarily determined by the expression of ADH1B and ADH1C. Because the expression levels of both ADH1B and ADH1C were notably decreased in CRC compared with adjacent normal tissues, we hypothesized that almost all CRC patients exhibit an impaired ethanol metabolism. In addition, 18 enzymes in the ALDH superfamily are responsible for the maintenance of a nontoxic level of acetaldehyde in cells, and among these, ALDH2, ALDH1A1

and ALDH1B1 are the most relevant to acetaldehyde oxidation [39]. However, the rate of ethanol-derived acetaldehyde breakdown is mainly determined by the alteration of ALDH2 because both ALDH1A1 and ALDH1B1 contribute to acetaldehyde metabolism only in the absence of ALDH2 [19]. Interestingly, our study found a statistical difference in the expression of ALDH2 between CRC and adjacent normal tissues, but this difference was extremely low in absolute value. Therefore, we hypothesized the existence of a functional difference in the ethanol-derived acetaldehyde metabolism between CRC and adjacent normal tissues. Collectively, the results indicate that ethanol, but not acetaldehyde, might accumulate much easier in CRC cells compared with normal epithelial cells. Ethanol plays a vital role in the development and progression of CRC.
To investigate the mechanistic role of ethanol in the migration/invasion of CRC cells, we selected the SW480 and HCT116 cell lines, which

have the lowest metabolic rate of ethanol, and used 4-MP to further slow the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde. However, no significant difference in the metabolic rate of ethanol and no biological
changes were detected in either cell line. These findings suggest that the basal metabolic rate of ethanol might be extremely low in SW480
and HCT116 cells and that ethanol is the cause of the observed changes in CRC cells. Moreover, we surprisingly found that ethanol could signifi-
cantly promote the expression and secretion of TGF-b1, whereas acetaldehyde exerted the opposite effects. It is well known that TGF-b1 is a vital ligand for the activation of TGF-b signalling [20], which plays an
important role in the development and progression of cancers [40,41].
This finding also suggested that ethanol might play a crucial role in CRC

metastasis by activating TGF-b signalling. In addition, although the
duration of the exposure of CRC cells to ethanol was notably shorter compared with that used in studies of breast cancer [17,42], significant changes were also found in our study, which indicated that CRC cells
might be highly sensitive to ethanol. Additional studies on CRC or other
types of cancer are necessary to further investigate the role of ethanol
itself in the development and progression of cancer.
Although previous studies have demonstrated that ethanol pro-
motes the expression of TGF-b1, the underlying mechanism remain
unclear [2023]. A recent study revealed that ethanol directly enhan-
ces the activation of TGF-b signalling by increasing the cell-surface and non-lipid raft microdomain localization of the type II TGF-b

receptor [21]. Thus, ethanol might activate TGF-b signalling by enhancing the sensitivity of the TGF-b receptor to TGF-b1, which is
already present in the tumour microenvironment and subsequently
auto-induced in CRC cells. In contrast, it is well known that ethanol accumulation can significantly enhance oxidative stress in cells and
thereby promote the expression of bioactive TGF-b1 [43,44]. Thus,
the ethanol/P450s/ROS axis might be another mechanism underlying
the ethanol-induced increase in the expression of TGF-b1.
Previous studies have demonstrated that RUNX3 is an independent
regulator of TGF-b signalling and acts as a tumour suppressor in a vari-
ety of cancers [31,4549]. Our investigation of the effects of ethanol on
TGF-b signalling surprisingly revealed that ethanol dose-independently
induced the cytoplasmic mislocalization of RUNX3, which is an impor-
tant reason for the elimination of its suppressive effect on tumours [32]. Intriguingly, we found that the recruitment of nuclear RUNX3 significantly reversed the effects of ethanol on EMT and the migration/invasion of CRC cells by targeting Snail. However, no significant change was found in the expression of P21, another important gene downstream of
TGF-b signalling [50]. These results suggested that the RUNX3-mediated regulation of the genes downstream of TGF-b signalling might be selec-
tive, and further studies are needed to investigate the underlying mech-
anism. In addition, because nuclear-localized RUNX3 plays a vital role in
tumour suppression [51,52], we hypothesized that the cytoplasmic mis-
localization of RUNX3 is another important mechanism underlying the
ethanol-induced development and progression of CRC.

It has been well established that RUNX3 combines with the phosphorylated-Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3) complex and subsequently enters the nucleus to regulate the transcription of downstream genes [30]. Our study demonstrated that RUNX3 could combine with the Smad2/ 3 complex before its phosphorylation and that exposure to ethanol did not change the binding of RUNX3 with the Smad2/3/RUNX3 complex. However, the combination of RUNX3 with the p-Smad2/3 complex was significantly dissociated after ethanol exposure. Thus, it is possible that ethanol induces the cytoplasmic mislocalization of RUNX3 by dissociating the p-Smad2/3/RUNX3 complex, which might result from chemical reactions with ethanol or ROS. Further investigations are needed to clarify the mechanism underlying the ethanolinduced dissociation of the p-Smad2/3/RUNX3 complex.
PFD is an orally available anti-fibrotic drug that exerts significant anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in many organs, including the lung, renal system, liver, heart, muscle and eye [53]. PFD regulates fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis mainly by inhibiting TGF-
b signalling [54]. Intriguingly, recent studies have revealed that PFD has important effects on the treatment of cancers by blocking TGF-b signal-
ling [27,28]. Our studies also demonstrated that PFD significantly inhibited the aggressiveness of CRC cells. Because ethanol exerts crucial
effects on tumour metastasis in CRC by activating TGF-b signalling, we
consider PFD to be a novel therapeutic strategy for alcohol-related CRC. In conclusion, our study highlights the effects of alcohol intake on
promoting CRC metastasis via the ethanol-mediated TGF-b/RUNX3/

abstract
Background: The poultry industry in Pakistan has flourished since the 1960s; however, there are scarce data regarding the impact of occupational exposure on the pulmonary health of farm workers in terms of years working in the industry. The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of poultry environment on the health of occupationally exposed poultry farmers in countries of warm climatic regions, such as Pakistan. This study will also show the effect of exposure to poultry facilities on the health of poultry farmers in the context of low-income countries with a relatively inadequate occupational exposure risk management. Materials and methods: The lung function capacity of 79 poultry workers was measured using a spirometer. Along with spirometry, a structured questionnaire was also administrated to obtain information about age, height, weight, smokers/nonsmokers, years of working experience, and pulmonary health of farm workers. The workers who were directly involved in the care and handling of birds in these intensive facilities were considered and divided into four groups based on their years of working experience: Group I (3-10 months), Group II (1-5 years), Group III (6-10 years), and Group IV (more than 11 years). The forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and the FEV1/ FVC ratio were considered to identify lung function abnormalities. Statistical analysis was carried out using independent sample t test, Chi-square test, Pearson's correlation, and linear regression. Results: Based on the performed spirometry, 68 (86 %) of workers were found normal and healthy, whereas 11 (14 %) had a mild obstruction. Of the 11 workers with mild obstruction, the highest number with respect to the total was in Group IV (more than 11 years of working experience) followed by Group III and Group II. Most of the workers were found healthy, which seems to be because of the healthy survivor effect. For the independent sample t test, a significant difference was noticed between healthy and nonhealthy farmers, whereas Chi-square test showed a significant association with height, drugs, and working experience. Linear regression that was stratified by respiratory symptoms showed for workers with symptoms, regression models for all spirometric parameters (FVC, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC) have better predictive power or R square value than those of workers without symptoms. Conclusion: These findings suggest that lung function capacity was directly related to years of working experience. With increasing number of working years, symptoms of various respiratory problems enhanced in the poultry workers. It should be noted that most of the poultry workers were healthy and young, the rationale being that there is a high turnover rate in this profession. The mobility in this job and our finding of 86% of the healthy workers in the present study also proposed healthy worker survivor effect.

1. Introduction
Poultry farming is flourishing in Pakistan as an industry since the 1960s to meet the protein demands of a growing population. Based on an estimate, the percentage of broiler farms in Punjab, Pakistan is 80 %, whereas, layer and breeder farms are 18 % and 2 %, respectively. Moreover, it is an important source of employment with almost 1.5 million people linked with this sector [1]. Besides fulfilling meat demands, controlled environment poultry facilities are a major source of emissions such as organic and inorganic dust, odorous compounds and greenhouse gases [2e6].The major components of organic dust are bacteria, fungi, spores, pollens, endotoxins, mycotoxins, and various sorts of allergens [7e9]. The sources of these emissions in poultry buildings are animal droppings, feed, litter, dander (bird's skin), and feathers [10,11].
Organic dust from poultry facilities can cause various respiratory problems such as upper respiratory tract irritations, chronic bronchitis, organic dust toxic syndrome, allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, asthma, inflammation, extrinsic alveolitis, and respirational symptoms [7,11e19]. It is reported that occupational respiratory diseases, both chronic and acute, are common in agricultural workers, particularly in pig and poultry farmers [7,12,15,16,20e22]. Health problems particularly of an acute nature develop within a few hours and may last for few days after exposure to these animal confinements [23]. In accordance with a study, occurrence of organic dust toxic syndrome ranges from 10 to 30% in workers, although it depends on the type of animal production units and use of facilities [11]. Moreover, a number of studies reported the prevalence of both respiratory and nonrespiratory symptoms washigher among poultry farmers [8,20,24]. Borlee et al. [25] and Van Dijk et al. [26] described the exacerbation of the respiratory symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and patients with asthma living in the vicinity of livestock farms. Various epidemiological studies also showed a high occurrence of respiratory symptoms and antagonistic changes in pulmonary function parameters in poultry workers [20,27e30].
Owing to continuously increasing demand for meat from a growing population and the advancements in the poultry industry, interest in joining this sector is increasing in Pakistan. In view of the importance of the health and safety of poultry workers, there is a need to assess the effect of poultry environment on the health of workers. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of respiratory problems among Pakistani poultry workers, determining the extent to which occupational exposure in a poultry facility will impact the respiratory health of workers. This study is also first of its kind from a warm climatic region such as Pakistan that will show the effect of exposure to poultry facilities on the health of poultry farmers in the context of low-income countries with a relatively inadequate occupational exposure risk management.
2. Materials and methods
Eighteen controlled environment broiler houses located on Raiwind and Kasur Road near Lahore, Pakistan were visited. The spirometry of 79 poultry workers was performed from Dec 2016 to July 2017. A detailed questionnaire was also designed to obtain general information about the worker's health, medical history, working conditions as shown in Table 9. Parameters of the questionnaire also included use of drugs and smokers/nonsmokers.
After filling questionnaires, the workers taken through a detailed demonstration about the use of a spirometer (MDX Instruments, USA) in accordance with the methods of the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine described by Townsend et al. [31] and (ATS/ERS 2005 guidelines) used by Viegas

et al. [23]. A MDX USA spirometer model SP 10 Spirotron was used during the study. It was a light weight and portable equipment and has a maximum volume of 10L, flow range of 16L/s, volume accuracy of 3% or 50ml, flow accuracy of 5% or 200ml/s, built in lithium battery (DC 3.7V), and dimensions of 97mm (L)  89 mm (W)  36 mm (H) with 150g net weight. The workers were instructed on the performance of spirometry and a digital spirometer of model SP10 was used with disposable mouthpieces. Before test performance, the information of gender, age, weight (body mass in kg was collected with already calibrated Wahoo balance smart phone scale 7/10) and height (measured in foot at standing position and converted in cm) was entered for each worker, and the use of spirometer was demonstrated by one of the worker for their ease of understanding. The following parameters were obtained from recorded data: forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow and FEV1/FVC ratio, force expiratory flow 25 (FEF), force expiratory flow 75 (FEF) and force expiratory flow 25-75; (FEF) however, only FVC, FEV1 and FEV1/FVC was considered for the interpretation of results. The spirometry test was revised twice or thrice with any workers that was not using spirometer in the appropriate way.
Poultry workers were categorized into four groups based on working experience: Group I (3-10 months), Group II (1-5 years), Group III (6-10 years), Group IV (more than 11-years) experience.
2.1. Statistical analysis
Data was statistically analyzed by descriptive statistics, independent samples t test, Chi-square test and by fitting linear regression using SPSS (version 25) [32]. The independent t test was used to test significant differences between two unrelated groups (healthy and nonhealthy farmers), Chi-square test was used to find association of lung function parameters with different variables. Moreover, linear regression was applied to predict different lung functions parameters of poultry workers in Pakistan.
3. Results
Of the total 79 poultry workers, 10 % were smoker, whereas 90 % were nonsmokers and only 3 % of smokers were also taking chewing tobacco products. It was noticed that 86 % of workers were normal and healthy, whereas 14 % had mild obstruction and respiratory problem such as chest tightness, eye and nose irritation, cough, sore throat, dyspnea, wheezing, and phlegm problems that particularly enhanced in winter (Table 1). The workers were divided into four groups as per their years of working experience and the ratio between total number of workers and workers with respiratory symptoms were higher in Group IV (more than 11 Years) as compared with all other groups (Table 2). In all determined parameters only FVC, FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio or FEV1% also called TiffeneauePinelli index, was focused and used for diagnosis

of obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. The FVC and FEV1% value greater than 80 is considered normal (healthy) and values were not analyzed for FVC/FEV1 ratio. However FVC greater than 80% but FEV1 less than 80 % and FVC/FEV1 ratio less than 70 % considered obstructive (nonhealthy). In this study, 86 % were found healthy and 14 % workers had shown lower FEV1 % and FVC/FEV1 ratio and considered as case of mild obstruction (Table 3).
Spirometry results were statistically analyzed for independent sample t test and absolute values provided in liters were compared between healthy and nonhealthy farmers for different lung function parameters (Table 4). The results of independent sample t test showed different parameters such as FEV1, FEV1 % predicted, peak expiratory flow and FEV1/FVC ratio have statistically significant difference at a 0.05 significance level; however, FVC and FVC % predicted have no significant difference at the 0.05 significance level (Table 4).
During performance of spirometry, the age, weight, height, drug taking, smoking and nonsmoking habits, working experience, and health history was recorded. A Chi-square test was carried out to see association between different variables of healthy and nonhealthy farmers. In accordance with the Chi-square findings, pvalue greater than >0.05 showed no association (Table 5). It was observed age, weight, smoker and nonsmoker were not significantly related to health conditions. However, significant association was found for height, drugs, and working experience at the (0.05) significance level.

The correlation of lung function parameters with different measured variables such as age, weight, height, experience, smoker/nonsmoker, and respiratory symptoms were determined. It was noticed that significant positive correlation was present between FVC and height. Furthermore, a significantly negative correlation was present with symptoms. However FEV1 was significant but negatively correlated with height, experience, and symptoms (Table 6).
A linear regression analysis was carried out and two sets of regression equations were obtained for all lung function parameters (FVC, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC) with predictor variables of age, weight, height, experience, smoker and nonsmokers, and respiratory symptoms. The estimated regression models for all spirometric parameters were stratified by respiratory symptoms. Prediction power of models was analyzed by R square value. It was noticed that in the first set of regression model to predict FVC was found significant (Table 7). It was seen the regression was significant in all lung function parameters, whereas symptoms were included in the model and has more predictive power than without symptoms (Table 8).
Mostly workers complained for cough, cough with expectoration (sputum), sore throat, dyspnea, phlegm, wheezing, nose watering, eye irritation, and skin allergies that exacerbate in winter however, no history of hemoptysis and any systemic complaints such as fever, headache, and myalgia (muscle pain) on exposure to these controlled environment broiler facilities was noticed (Table 9). It was noticed most of the poultry workers were young in these facilities, which might be due to high turnover rate. The data was organized age wise and frequency along with percentage was determined (Table 10). It was also noticed that there was no training or use of masks and any other personal protective equipment (PPE) in the sheds for the workers.
4. Discussion
The study aimed to evaluate the respiratory symptoms and lung function parameters among workers in broiler facilities. The seventy-nine workers were divided into four groups based on their job experience, and it was seen almost 86 % workers were with good health and 14 % showed mild obstruction, and the study was in agreement with De Alencar et al. [33] where, 72.98 % occupationally exposed broiler house workers were found normal and healthy; however, 24.32 % had light restriction and 2.70 % had severe obstruction. However, Taluja et al. [24] reported the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in poultry farm workers were 43.93 % which was higher than the present study. The study is also in line with various other studies that suggest a direct relation exist for reduction of pulmonary functions and number of working years [13,23]. The respiratory problems in poultry workers are associated with occupational exposure to hazards such as organic dust, and certain allergic factors enhanced the percentage of mild obstruction in intensive agriculture farm workers and chiefly responsible for

exacerbating respiratory symptoms with the passage of time [13,27,34,36,36,37].
De-Alencar et al. [33] findings of a weak association present between lung function capacity and respiratory symptoms is in agreement with the present study as spirometry results were found normal for most workers; however, they were experiencing various respiratory symptoms on exposure to these facilities. It was also noticed that most of the workers reported the appearance of certain specific symptoms on exposure to these facilities such as cough, eye watering, nose irritation, and sore throat as mentioned in (Table 9), and this is in agreement with Kearney et al. [38] who reported the percentage of eye irritation (55 %), nose irritation (50 %), and dry cough problems (50 %) in workers. De-Alencar et al. [33] also reported nasal, eye, and throat complaints were found common in poultry workers. Moreover, Kirkhorn et al. [39] reported the presence of mucous membrane irritation and Rylander and Carvalheiro [28], reported various other respiratory problems such as chronic bronchitis, airways inflammation, chest infections, and toxic pneumonitis prevailed in poultry workers on exposure to organic dust as compared with a control group. However, Kirychuk et al. [37] reported a higher percentage of chronic phlegm in floor houses compared with caged house workers owing to a higher level of dust in floor house. De-Alencar et al. [33] also found asthma-like and mucous membrane syndrome. Rees et al. [40] reported workrelated cough and wheezing problems 32 % and 23 %, respectively along with asthma, chest, eye, nose, skin, and throat irritations.
The study was also analogous to different work-related problems such as asthma, nose, eye watering, skin allergies, and an insignificant decrease in lung function capacity which was high in poultry workers compared with control according to Rimac et al.

[22]. Wheezing problems, a trait that partially leads to occupational asthma in response to exposure to contaminated to poultry farms, was found almost in one-third of poultry workers according to Borghetti et al. [41]. A number of literature studies support that harmful pollutant in the surrounding environment affects the health of people generally and lungs particularly [29,35,42e48].
In the context of the present study, the FVC/FEV1 ratio was found <70 % with lower FEV1 and normal FVC, which suggests mild obstruction in poultry workers and similarly a significantly lower values of FVC/FEV1 with obstruction and restrictions was reported in workers of other animal caring units i.e., (swine and broiler houses) [33,37].
The present study also informed that age, exposure time, and smoking had no effect on FVC, FEV1 and FVC/FEV1, and similar confirmation was given by Stoleski et al. [49]. However, a study by Abdullah and Hashim [50], reported that smoking significantly enhanced the frequency of symptoms and impaired lung functions.
Linear regression model was used to predict FVC, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC using predictors (age, height, weight, experience, smoker/nonsmoker, and symptoms). It was noticed R2 values were improved with the addition of symptoms as compared with values without symptoms (Tables 7 and 8). The derivation of prediction equation was found in literature for different population groups; however, it was noticed that the use of derived equation for one population might be inappropriate for other population even after applying correction factors [51]. Various other studies also informed that applying different equations on the same population results in conflict in the diagnosis [52,53]. The predictive equations also showed great variations owing to considered parameters such as height, age, weight, smoking status, and symptoms, which were used to predict an equation by Nku et al. [54] and socioeconomic status was also considered for the prediction of the equation along age, height, weight, and smoking by Rabbani and Nafees [55].
In the present study, it was observed by the Chi-square test that different variables such as working experience, height, and drugs were associated with health conditions, but no association was found with age, weight, smoker, and nonsmoker with their health conditions. However, a study conducted with poultry workers for prevalence of tuberculosis and avian influenza using a Chi-square test showed a significant association between occupational health problems and marital status, educational level, and employment status [34].
Most of the workers in the present study were young, and Ajetomobi et al. [56] also mentioned in his study that most of the poultry workers were young. The rationales behind young workers are high turnover rate in this profession. The causes for higher turnover rate were discussed with supervisors and explanation were similar in all controlled environment broiler facilities as low income, more working hours, and some of them when they felt any sort of health irritation they discontinued the job. This mobility in the job and our finding of 86 % of the workers in the present study as healthy may suggest healthy worker survivor effect [57]. There was no availability of preliminary medical data regarding health issues of workers and employees who had left. The use of PPE was not found in poultry workers even though they complained about high levels of dust and irritation on exposure and findings were in agreement with de-Alencar et al. [33] and Viegas et al. [23]. However, the use of PPE was recommended owing to high dust exposure to poultry farmers by Rousset et al. [46]. A study by Kearney et al. [38] regarding PPE showed 76 % workers reported that the use of PPE is important and only 48 % workers reported no or rare use of PPE while working in dusty environment.
5. Conclusion
It was seen that respiratory health issues were found in poultry farm workers; however, most of the workers in this study were

R. Yasmeen et al / Intensive Poultry Facilities in Pakistan

healthy (86 %) and only 14% showed mild obstruction. The obstructive problems increased with the number of working years. Furthermore, respiratory problems such as chest infection, cough, sore throat, skin allergies, chest tightness, phlegm, eye and nose irritation were reported that exacerbate in winter season. However, the job turnover rate was high owing to low income, long working hours, and health issues. It was observed that those people who felt health issues from their work left the job. Most of the persons related to this occupation were found to be young, and the use of PPE was not in practice. There is a need to not only enforce existing occupational health and safety laws by the country Labour Department but also for the provision of information and training to both owners and workers on the potential risks of exposure to organic dust and appropriate administrative, environmental, as well as PPE to reduce the risk of exposure to workers in these facilities. Further studies with larger sample size of poultry workers and control group are needed to improve certainty in degree and frequency of exposure and resultant health consequences.

Mutations in dysferlin are responsible for a group of progressive, recessively inherited muscular dystrophies known as dysferlinopathies. Using recombinant proteins and affinity purification methods combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we found that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)g1 was bound to a region of dysferlin located between the third and fourth C2 domains. Using ex vivo laser injury experiments, we demonstrated that the AMPK complex was vital for the sarcolemmal damage repair of skeletal muscle fibers. Injury-induced AMPK complex accumulation was dependent on the presence of Ca2+, and the rate of accumulation was regulated by dysferlin. Furthermore, it was found that the phosphorylation of AMPKa was essential for plasma membrane repair, and treatment with an AMPK activator rescued the membrane-repair impairment observed in immortalized human myotubes with reduced expression of dysferlin and dysferlin-null mouse fibers. Finally, it was determined that treatment with the AMPK activator metformin improved the muscle phenotype in zebrafish and mouse models of dysferlin deficiency. These findings indicate that the AMPK complex is essential for plasma membrane repair and is a potential therapeutic target for dysferlinopathy.
INTRODUCTION
Dysferlinopathies are a group of progressive, recessively inherited muscular dystrophies that include Miyoshi myopathy,1,2 limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) type 2B,3,4 and distal anterior compartment myopathy.5 These conditions are caused by mutations in the gene encoding dysferlin, a transmembrane protein consisting of seven C2 domains, three Fer domains, and two DysF domains.6 In humans, dysferlin is highly expressed in the skeletal and cardiac muscles.3 The impaired healing of membrane disruption in the muscle fibers of dysferlin-deficient mice indicates that dysferlin is involved in plasma membrane repair.7-9

The pathogenic dysferlin mutations reported in patients to date have been shown to decrease the protein levels of dysferlin in skeletal muscles.6 A marked reduction in the levels of dysferlin due to missense mutations suggests that the mutated protein is recognized and degraded by the quality control system in the cell.10 Additionally, the expression of full-length dysferlin has been reported to rescue these cells from the pathological characteristics of dysferlinopathy in vitro.11 These studies highlight the importance of investigating loss-of-function mechanisms in the exploration of therapeutic strategies for dysferlinopathy.
To date, numerous candidate dysferlin-binding proteins, such as AHNAK,12,13 caveolin 3,14 vinculin,15 mitsugumin 53 (MG53; also known as TRIM72),16 and annexins,17 have been identified. It appears that these are involved in various aspects of the dysferlin-mediated repair pathway, including intracellular vesicle aggregation and trafficking, in addition to the targeting and fusion of a hydrophobic patch to the breached plasma membrane.
We hypothesized that membrane-bound dysferlin serves as a scaffold protein for functional molecules and that the dysferlin-binding partner is pivotal in plasma membrane repair. The present study aimed to identify a binding partner for dysferlin, and thus provide novel insights into the underlying mechanism of defected plasma membrane repair in dysferlinopathy.

RESULTS
Identification of AMPKg1 as a Dysferlin-Binding Protein Human dysferlin is a large membrane protein with a molecular mass of 230 kDa comprising seven C2 domains that bind to the lipid bilayer of the sarcolemma (Figure 1A). Considering that the II region consists of 660 aa (amino acids 481-1140), the region was divided into two parts for experiments in the present study (Figure 1A). These regions were then subcloned into plasmids (primers are listed in Table S1). Maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tagged recombinant proteins containing the II region were expressed in Escherichia coli (arrows in Figure 1B). The lysates from HEK293T cells were then mixed with the tagged proteins and immunoprecipitated with anti-MBP magnetic beads. The co-precipitated proteins were then separated by SDS-

PAGE, silver stained (Figure 1C), and analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Of the 10 proteins analyzed, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)g1 and protein phosphatase (PPP) 1CA were identified in dysferlin co-precipitates (Figure 1C). The observed co-precipitation of AMPKg1 and PPP1CA with dysferlin suggested that the AMPK complex might be involved in the function of dysferlin and membrane repair.
To examine whether AMPKg1 specifically binds to dysferlin in skeletal muscles, the products of the co-precipitation assays were subjected to anti-dysferlin immunoblotting. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged recombinant proteins containing the N- or C-terminal region of AMPKg1 were expressed in E. coli (Figures 1D and 1E). Lysates of mouse skeletal muscle were mixed with the tagged proteins and immunoprecipitated with anti-GST magnetic beads. The co-precipitated proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE. Dysferlin was detected in the chromatographic fraction of the AMPKg1 C-terminal region and weakly detected in

the N-terminal region using a monoclonal anti-dysferlin antibody (Figure 1F).
To examine whether AMPK is associated with endogenously expressed dysferlin, the cell lysates of the mouse skeletal muscle were immunoprecipitated with an anti-AMPKg1 antibody, anti-dysferlin antibody, or control immunoglobulin G (IgG), and the precipitates were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-dysferlin and anti-AMPKg1 antibodies. Endogenous dysferlin was detected with the anti-dysferlin antibody, and endogenous AMPKg1 was detected with the anti-AMPKg1 antibody in the immunoprecipitates, but not in those with control IgG (Figure 1G; full blot in Figure S1). These results indicate the association between dysferlin and AMPKg1 in mouse skeletal muscle tissue.
Dysferlin Regulates the Rate of Recruitment of AMPKg1 to the Injured Plasma Membrane Site We investigated whether the AMPK complex is involved in membrane repair, given that its binding partner, dysferlin, serves a key role in sarcolemmal repair.8 To directly evaluate the dynamic process of membrane repair in living myofibers, the plasma membrane of myofibers transduced with GFP-tagged AMPKg1 was mechanically injured using a two-photon laser in the presence of the FM4-64 fluorescent dye. The site of injury (red line at 2 s in Figure 2A) was identified as the site of FM4-64 accumulation (white arrowheads in Figure 2A). Rapid (<10 s) and localized recruitment of GFP-AMPKg1 to the site of injury was observed (white arrows in Figure 2A), with GFP-AMPKg1 surrounding the injury site (merged images in Figure 2A; Video S1). However, no localized recruitment of unconjugated GFP (control) was observed (Figure S2A). Quantification of the GFP-AMPKg1 signal at the site of FM4-64 accumulation revealed that the fluorescence intensity of GFP-AMPKg1 was significantly higher than that of unconjugated GFP (Figure 2B).
A previous study reported that dysferlin-GFP is recruited to myofibers within 5 s of injury.20 As AMPKg1 and dysferlin share a similar pattern of rapid accumulation at injury sites, we investigated whether dysferlin has an active role in the accumulation of AMPKg1. To examine the biological function of the association between dysferlin and AMPKg1 in sarcolemmal repair, membrane-repair assays were performed using mouse skeletal muscle co-transfected with Venustagged dysferlin and DsRed-tagged AMPKg1. Dysferlin was recruited

to the membrane region within 5 s following injury, and the accumulation of AMPKg1 was partially co-localized with dysferlin at the membrane region (Figure 2C; Figures S3 and S4). The results of the co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that dysferlin and AMPKg1 form a protein complex when co-expressed in mouse skeletal muscle (Figure 2D). To determine whether dysferlin regulates the injury-induced accumulation of AMPKg1, this accumulation was examined in the absence of dysferlin. Membrane-repair assays involving the use of GFP-AMPKg1 in the presence of FM4-64 fluorescent dye revealed that GFP-AMPKg1 accumulated more slowly (>30 s) in the injured myofibers of dysferlin-deficient BLA/J mice21 than in C57BL/6J control mice (Figure 2E; Video S2). Quantification of the GFP-AMPKg1 signal at the site of injury, which was also the site of FM4-64 accumulation, revealed a significant decrease in the fluorescence intensity of BLA/J myofibers until 30 s after injury (Figure 2F), which indicates that the rate of accumulation of AMPKg1 is regulated by dysferlin.
AMPK Complex Is Recruited to the Injury Site The role of the AMPK catalytic a subunit in membrane repair was examined. Using experiments similar to those conducted on regulatory subunit AMPKg1, we investigated the catalytic subunits AMPKa1 and AMPKa2, which were frequently observed to accumulate at the injury site of damaged myofibers (Figures S5A, S6, and S7A). Rapid (<10 s) and localized recruitment of GFP-AMPKa1 to the site of injury was observed (white arrows in Figure S5A), with GFPAMPKa1 surrounding the injury site, similar to AMPKg1 (merged images in Figure S5A; Video S3). Quantification of the GFP-AMPKa1 signal at the site of injury, identified as the site of FM4-64 accumulation, revealed that the fluorescence intensity of GFP-AMPKa1 was significantly higher than that of unconjugated GFP (control) (Figure S5B).
The morphology of accumulated GFP-AMPKa1 is affected by slight differences in parameters, such as laser strength, laser angle, and cell thickness. The forms of the accumulation were mainly a C-shape, circle, and line (Figure S6). It was observed that plasma membrane wounding was occasionally followed by rapid formation of a localized bleb in the muscle fiber of wild-type (WT) mice. A previous study reported that the occurrence of membrane blebbing in response to hypotonic shock required the presence of dysferlin in human- and mouse-cultured myotubes.22 Another group reported that membrane

blebbing occurred in response to laser injury in HeLa cells.23 In the present study, the bleb rapidly became positive for DsRed-AMPKg1 (Figure S4) and negative for unconjugated GFP (control) (Figure S2B). These findings indicate that the AMPK complex accumulates at the site of laser injury.
AMPKg1 and AMPKa1 Are Required for Effective Membrane Repair in C2C12 Cells A previous study of laser-induced damage demonstrated a role of dysferlin in the sarcolemmal repair of C2C12 cells.24 To evaluate the role of AMPKg1 in the membrane-repair process, the ability of the muscle to recover following laser-induced damage was measured by analyzing the entry of the FM1-43 fluorescent dye into AMPKg1knockdown C2C12 cells (Figures 3A-3D; for small interfering RNA [siRNA] targets, refer to Table S2). Using immunoblotting, the knockdown of AMPKg1 was confirmed (Figures 3A and 3B). WT cells effectively repaired plasma membrane damage (damaged sites are indicated by white arrows in Figure 3C), as the entry of FM1-43 fluorescent dye observed following laser damage was minimal (upper panels in Figure 3C). In contrast, there was significant FM1-43 fluorescent dye entry into the AMPKg1-knockdown C2C12 cells following laser-induced damage (lower panels in Figure 3C), revealing a defective membrane-repair function. The quantification of FM1-43 revealed significantly increased fluorescence in the AMPKg1 siRNA-administered C2C12 cells (Figure 3D).
To evaluate the role of the AMPK catalytic a subunit in membrane repair, FM1-43 fluorescent dye was used to assess membrane repair in cells with siRNA-induced knockdown of AMPKa1 and AMPKa2, which was confirmed via immunoblotting (Figures 3E and 3F; Figures S7B and S7C). There was significant FM1-43 fluorescent dye entry into AMPKa1-knockdown C2C12 muscle cells following laser-induced damage (Figures 3G and 3H; Videos S4 and S5), revealing defective membrane repair in these cells. In contrast, FM1-43 intensity was not profoundly affected in AMPKa2-knockdown cells (Figure S7D). These results indicate that both AMPKg1 and AMPKa1 are important for membrane repair in C2C12 cells.
Injury-Induced Accumulation of AMPKg1 Is Dependent on Ca2+ Ca2+ is essential for wound repair25 and is likely to be involved in early signaling following membrane damage. As it was established that the cell surface accumulation of dysferlin is triggered by Ca2+,26 the pre-

sent study examined whether the injury-induced increase in Ca2+ also leads to the accumulation of AMPKg1. Rapid and localized recruitment of GFP-AMPKg1 to the site of injury was observed in the presence of Ca2+ (Figure 2A; Video S1) but not in its absence (Figure 4A; Video S6). Quantification of the GFP-AMPKg1 signal revealed a lack of fluorescence owing to Ca2+ depletion (Figure 4B). Under Ca2+-depleted conditions, no significant difference was observed in the fluorescence intensity between the GFP-AMPKg1 signal and the unconjugated GFP signal (control) at the site of injury (Figure 4C). These findings indicate that the accumulation of AMPKg1 is dependent on the presence of Ca2+.
Phosphorylation of AMPKa Is Necessary for Plasma Membrane
Repair To reproduce the membrane wound conditions, we administered ionomycin treatment to mimic Ca2+ overflow. The ionomycin-induced Ca2+ flux increased the phosphorylation of AMPKa in normal human skeletal muscle myotubes (Figures 5A and 5B). As the administration of compound C (Cc) significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of AMPKa induced by ionomycin treatment (Figures 5A and 5B), Cc was used to examine the effect of the inhibited phosphorylation of AMPKa by Ca2+ overflow. Following laser-induced damage, significant FM1-43 fluorescent dye entry into human myotubes was observed following the administration of 10 mM Cc, indicating defective membrane repair (Figure 5C). The quantification of FM1-43 revealed significantly increased fluorescence in the Cc-administered human myotubes (Figure 5D). As with the human myotubes, the administration of Cc significantly suppressed the basal activity of AMPKa phosphorylation in the C57BL/6J myofibers (Figures 5E and 5F). Following laser-induced damage, significant FM1-43 fluorescent dye entry into the mouse skeletal muscle was observed following the administration of 10 mM Cc, indicating defective membrane repair (Figures 5G and 5H). These results led us to test the hypothesis that a phosphorylation of AMPKa is necessary for plasma membrane repair.
AMPK Activators Rescue the Membrane-Repair Defect in
Immortalized Myotubes of Patients with Dysferlinopathy and
Dysferlin-Deficient Mouse Skeletal Muscle Fibers The effect of AMPK activators was examined using human immortalized myotubes derived from patients with dysferlinopathy.27 We used "line 107," which carries compound heterozygous mutations located before the II region that partially expresses dysferlin (Table S3).

results revealed a decrease in the protein level of dysferlin in line 107 (Figures S8A-S8C) and membrane-repair deficits compared with that in the control (Figure S8D). Following serum starvation and treatment with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AI-

CAR), an activator of AMPK, elevated levels of phosphorylated AMPK was observed in line 107 (Figures 6A and 6B). Surprisingly, treatment with AICAR significantly reduced the entry of the FM143 fluorescent dye into the myotubes of a patient with dysferlinopathy

following laser-induced damage (Figures 6C and 6D; Videos S7 and S8). To determine whether treatment with an AMPK activator other than AICAR could rescue the membrane-repair defect, line 107 was treated with metformin, a drug used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. As with AICAR, metformin increased the level of phosphorylated AMPK (Figures 6A and 6B) and rescued the membrane-repair defect (Figure 6E). AICAR also accelerated the membrane-repair process in immortalized human myotubes from normal subjects (AB1079) expressing normal levels of dysferlin (Figures S9A-S9C). However, in another patient with dysferlinopathy ("line 379") with complete dysferlin deficiency (Figures S10A-S10C), AICAR did not have an effect on membrane repair (Figures S10D-S10F). Finally, to evaluate the effect of AMPK activators using dysferlin-deficient mouse muscles, myofibers of BLA/J mice were used. The phosphorylation of AMPKa was compared between BLA/J mice myofibers treated with AICAR and those separately treated with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) (+), and it was confirmed that the levels of phosphorylated AMPKa were elevated in the BLA/J mice myofibers treated with AICAR (Figures 6F and 6G). It was evident that AICAR treatment significantly reduced the entry of FM1-43 fluorescent dye into the myofibers of BLA/J mice following laser-induced damage (Figures 6H and 6I).
Zebrafish Model of Dysferlin Deficiency The results of our in vitro studies indicated that AMPK activators increased membrane damage repair in the presence of dysferlin, even when the expression of dysferlin was low. To confirm the effect of an AMPK activator in vivo, the dysferlin-deficient zebrafish model was used.
The predicted amino acid sequence of zebrafish dysferlin has a similarity of approximately 68% to mammalian dysferlin. The N-terminal region of the predicted amino acid sequence is similar to those of human dysferlin variant 8 (GenBank: NM_003494) and mouse dysferlin variant 2 (GenBank: NM_001077694).29 To generate zebrafish models of myopathies associated with dysferlin deficiency, a morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) was designed to disrupt the splicing pattern of dysferlin mRNA at the intron 3/exon 4 junction during development (Figure 7A). The injected embryos were examined 4 days post-fertilization (dpf). RT-PCR and sequence analyses confirmed that MO injection resulted in the complete deletion of dysferlin exon 4 (106 bp) (Figure 7B).

MO injection (1.5 ng) led to the loss of muscle birefringence (Figure 7C). To improve visualization of the structure and organization of morphant muscle fibers, the MO- and control MO (CMO)-injected embryos were analyzed using birefringence assays at 4 dpf (Figure 7C). The patterns of birefringence in the dysferlin morphant embryos were markedly abnormal compared with those in the WT and CMO embryos (Figures 7C and 7D). Of the MO-injected embryos, approximately 30.0% exhibited reduced birefringence, 36.7% appeared normal, and 33.3% had died (Figure 7D). The injection of increased doses of MO (3 or 6 ng) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of dead fish. However, this percentage was unchanged among fish injected with 1, 3, or 6 ng of CMO (Figure S11). These findings indicate that the toxicity of these MOs was low.
AMPK Activators Improve Muscle Phenotype in a Zebrafish Model of Dysferlin Deficiency Mixed populations of the above-mentioned morphants, which include normal, reduced birefringence, and dead fish, were used to confirm the effects of AMPK activators. We evaluated the percentage of reduced birefringence as a readout. It was found that AICAR treatment at 0.1, 1.0, and 10 mM increased the phosphorylation of AMPK, although this was not statistically significant between the AICARtreated and untreated morphants (Figure 7E). Without AICAR treatment, 31.1% of the morphants exhibited abnormal birefringence (Figure 7F). Reduced birefringence was observed in 22.2%, 17.8%, and 17.8% of the fish administered with 0.1, 1.0, and 10 mM AICAR, respectively (Figure 7F). It was also confirmed that metformin treatment (1 and 10 mM) increased the phosphorylation of AMPK, although this was not statistically significant between the metformin-treated and untreated morphants (Figure 7G). Without metformin treatment, 33.3% of the morphants exhibited abnormal birefringence (Figure 7H). Metformin treatment reduced the percentage of affected fish exhibiting abnormal birefringence. Furthermore, reduced birefringence was observed in 25.0% and 20.8% of the fish administered with 1 and 10 mM metformin, respectively (Figure 7H). It was suggested that several AMPK activators improved the muscle phenotype in a zebrafish model of dysferlin deficiency.
AMPK Activator Improves the Muscle Phenotype in a Mouse Model of Dysferlin Deficiency The effects of AMPK activators were investigated in well-studied mouse models of dysferlinopathy in BLA/J and SJL/J mice (Figure 8;

Figures S12-S14). A dysferlin defect was identified in BLA/J mice using immunoblotting (Figure S13). A previous study reported mouse plasma metformin concentrations of 0.45 and 1.7 mg/mL when administered in drinking water at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ mL, respectively.30 These plasma concentrations are similar to those in patients with diabetes treated with metformin (0.5-2.0 mg/mL). During 2 months, the activation of AMPK was compared between BLA/J mice treated with metformin and those untreated (Figure S12A). We addressed whether metformin treatment would be sufficient to modulate AMPK pathways in mice skeletal muscle. Acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase (ACC), a key enzyme in fatty acid synthesis, is the protein to be phosphorylated and inactivated by AMPK. Phosphorylation of ACC was usually indicated as the activity of the AMPK pathway.31 Ribosomal protein S6 (S6) participates in the regulation of cell size, cell proliferation, and glucose homeostasis. Phosphorylation of S6 was decreased by AMPK activation.32 Although the phosphorylation of AMPKa was variable across individual animals, long-term activation of AMPK and its downstream targets was observed following the oral administration of metformin (Figure S13). No reductions in animal body weight or grip strength were found during the experimental period (Figures S12B and S12C). The level of serum creatine kinase (CK) tended to decrease in the metformin-administered mice, although this was not statistically significant (Figure S12D). Muscle fiber histograms revealed a decrease in the severity of muscle atrophy and an increase in the number of normal muscle fibers (Figures S12E and S12F). The number of internal nuclei tended to decrease in the metformin-treated group (Figure S12G). In addition, to assess sarcolemmal membrane integrity, histological sections with fluorescent-labeled antibodies against mouse IgG were stained.33 Quantification of the percentage of IgGpositive fibers tended to be lower in the metformin-treated mice,

although this was not statistically significant (Figure S12H). Therefore, serum CK and histopathological analyses revealed that metformin treatment partially reduced myofiber damage in the BLA/J mouse model.
The second dysferlinopathy model in SJL/J mice was used following the observation of improved membrane repair in the partially deficient dysferlinopathy line (line 107) (Figure 6) but not in the completely deficient dysferlinopathy line (line 379) (Figure S10). The activation of AMPK was compared between SJL/J mice treated with metformin and those untreated for 8 months (Figure 8A). The long-term activation of AMPK and its downstream targets was observed following the oral (Figures S14A and S14B) and intraperitoneal (Figures S14C and S14D) administration of metformin. As with the results in the BLA/J mice, the levels of phosphorylated AMPKa were also variable. No reduction in the body weight was recorded during the experimental period (Figure 8B), whereas grip strength increased marginally in the metformin-treated mice (Figure 8C). It was also observed that the serum CK levels were significantly decreased in the metformin-treated mice (Figure 8D). Fibrosis was measured as the concentration of collagen (hydroxyproline) in gastrocnemius muscle tissues. Although no statistically significant difference in fibrosis was observed between the metformin-treated and control mice, the collagen concentrations tended to be lower in the metformin-treated mice (Figure 8E). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images of muscle cross-sections are shown in Figure 8F. Decreased numbers of internal nuclei were also observed in the metformin-treated group (Figure 8G). Muscle fiber histograms revealed a significant decrease in the severity of muscle atrophy and an increase in the number of normal muscle fibers in the metformin-treated mice (Figures 8H and 8I). IgG staining images of the muscles in

Statistically significant differences (*p < 0.05) were determined using the Wilcoxon test. Data are expressed as mean  SE. (F) FDBs of BLA/J mice were used to examine the effects of AICAR treatment. A previous study reported that the levels of phosphorylated AMPKa in mouse skeletal muscle at 20-40 min post-AICAR (250 mg/kg) injection were significantly higher than those at other time periods.28 To leverage that work, AICAR (250 mg/kg) was injected into BLA/J mice intraperitoneally, and FDBs were isolated 20 min after injection. To achieve AMPK activation, the FDBs were cultured for 20 min in the presence of AICAR (2 mM) after isolation (labeled with AICAR). In the control group, the FDBs were cultured for 40 min in a PBS (+) buffer following isolation (labeled with PBS (+)). A representative western blot image of dysferlin, phospho-AMPK, AMPKa, and GAPDH in PBS (+) and AICAR is shown. (G) Quantification of phospho-AMPK expression was normalized to AMPKa.

cross-sections are shown in Figure 8J. Quantification of the percentage of IgG-positive fibers was significantly lower in the metformintreated mice (Figure 8K). These data indicate that the administration of metformin reduced muscle damage in the dysferlinopathy model.
DISCUSSION We hypothesized that the binding partners of dysferlin serve as functional molecules during the membrane-repair process. The present study focused on the mechanisms underlying the interaction of dysferlin with several specific partners. As two Fer and DysF functional domains are situated between the third and fourth C2 domains, the binding protein at this site (II region) was examined via a biochemical approach (Figure 1A). Using recombinant proteins and affinity purification methods combined with LC-MS/MS, AMPKg1 was shown to bind to dysferlin at the II region. AMPK is a critical regulator of skeletal muscle metabolism, transcription, and phenotype.34 The potential for clinical synergism between the pharmacological and physiological stimulation of AMPK to ameliorate dystrophic pathology is particularly intriguing.35,36 The AMPK complex is allosterically activated by increasing the concentrations of AMP and ADP, and via Thr172 residue phosphorylation on the a subunit.37 The phosphorylated Thr172 residue can be dephosphorylated by three AMPK phosphatases: PPP1, PPP2A, and PPP2C.37 As AMPKg1 and PPP1CA were identified in dysferlin co-precipitates (Figure 1C), we examined whether the AMPK complex is involved in dysferlin function and membrane repair. The results revealed for the first time that the AMPK complex is involved in the membrane-repair process.
AMPK consists of a heterotrimeric protein complex containing a catalytic a subunit and two regulatory subunits (b and g) in the stoichiometry of 1a:1b:1g.34 The seven AMPK subunit isoforms give rise to 12 heterotrimeric combinations that appear to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner. In skeletal muscle preparations from humans and mice, all subunit isoforms have been detected, but only a subset of possible heterotrimeric complexes appears to exist.38,39 In human skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis), three different complexes have been described (a2b2g1, a2b2g3, and a1b1g1),38 whereas in mouse

skeletal muscle, five complexes have been identified (a2b2g1, a2b2g3, a2b1g1, a1b2g1, and a1b1g1).39 In addition, certain AMPK subunits are expressed in a fiber-dependent manner,40 which may explain the relative distribution of complexes between different muscles.39 Among these AMPK subunit isoforms, we found that the AMPK complex (comprising g1 and a1) is required for effective membrane repair in C2C12 cells (Figure 3).
Despite the numerous downstream targets of the AMPK complex,41,42 its direct involvement in plasma membrane repair remains to be elucidated. The targeted disruption of the mouse AMPKg1 gene causes regenerative hemolytic anemia by increasing the sequestration of abnormal erythrocytes.43 AMPKg1-deficient erythrocytes are highly resistant to osmotic hemolysis and are poorly deformable in response to increasing shear stress, consistent with greater membrane rigidity.43 These observations suggest that the AMPK complex is also involved in the maintenance of plasma membrane integrity in nonmuscle cells. Our ex vivo laser injury experiments revealed the importance of the AMPK complex for membrane repair of sarcolemmal damage in skeletal muscle fibers. We now know that AMPK complex accumulation in response to injury is dependent on the presence of Ca2+, and the rate of this accumulation is regulated by dysferlin. Dysferlin is considered to interact with MG53, annexins, and other proteins during vesicle accumulation at the site of injury following membrane disruption.16,17,44 Annexins (A1, A2, A5, and A6) form a repair cap at the membrane lesion,45 whereas the AMPK complex is recruited either to the site of injury (Figures S6B, S6C, and S7A) or to surrounding the site of injury (Figure 2A; Figures S5A and S6A), similar to MG53.20 Elucidating the involvement of the AMPK complex with these proteins during muscle membrane repair is required.
The novel schema we propose suggests that the membrane-repair process is associated with dysferlin and the AMPK complex. Membrane disruption causes Ca2+ flooding into the muscle fiber and creates a high Ca2+ zone around the disruption site. The ability of the ferlin C2 domains to bind phospholipids in a Ca2+-sensitive manner has been suggested.46 High Ca2+ levels result in the binding of the

dysferlin C2 domain to sarcolemmal phospholipids, thereby presumably causing structural changes in the II region of dysferlin. Ca2+ flux also results in the phosphorylation of AMPKa (Figures 5A and 5B). Our results suggest that a conformational change in the II region triggers the interaction between dysferlin and the AMPK complex, because the co-localization of dysferlin and the AMPK complex primarily occurred with membrane damage (Figure 2C; Figures S3 and S4). It should be appreciated that one limitation of this method is its reliance on the overexpression of fluorescently-tagged proteins. Visualizing the conformational change of dysferlin by a Ca2+ flux via a nano-dynamics visualization technique, such as high-speed atomic force microscopy,47,48 may assist in proving this hypothesis.
We observed that membrane repair was improved in a partially deficient dysferlinopathy line (line 107) by the phosphorylation of AMPKa (Figures 6A-6E) but not in a completely deficient dysferlinopathy line (line 379, Figure S10). This suggested that the dysferlinAMPK complex is actively involved in membrane repair. Conversely, it was observed that GFP-AMPKg1 was recruited to the wound even in the complete absence of dysferlin in mice, although at a slower rate in this context (Figures 2E and 2F). Additionally, AICAR treatment significantly reduced the entry of the FM1-43 fluorescent dye into the myofibers of BLA/J mice following laser-induced damage (Figures 6H and 6I). These findings demonstrate that the dysferlin-independent pathway for the regulation of AMPK phosphorylation is also involved in membrane repair in dysferlinopathy.
Interestingly, animal models with AMPK depletion, specifically in skeletal muscle fibers, exhibit a myopathic phenotype.49-51 In the muscles of young and old mice, a low-calorie diet activates AMPK and markedly increases muscle regeneration.52 The results of several studies in which dystrophin-deficient mdx mice were treated with AMPK activation compounds, such as AICAR, resveratrol, and metformin, suggest that targeting AMPK in the skeletal muscle may ameliorate the pathology observed in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).53-55 We examined three types of in vivo dysferlin-deficient models. In the case of MO-administered zebrafish, a small amount of dysferlin transcript persisted (Figure 7B). SJL/J mice had approximately 15% residual dysferlin (Figure S14A), whereas BLA/J mice had no dysferlin (Figure S13A). We found that the activation of AMPK improved membrane repair in dysferlin-defi-

cient mouse muscle fibers (BLA/J mice, Figures 6F-6I), and treatment with metformin partially reduced muscle damage in BLA/J mice (Figure S12). Additionally, activation of the dysferlin-AMPK complex markedly improved membrane repair (line 107; Figures 6A-6E) and the muscle phenotype in zebrafish (Figure 7) and SJL/J mice (Figure 8), exhibiting with residual expression of dysferlin. Therefore, utilization of the protein-protein interaction of AMPK with dysferlin for developing a therapeutic strategy in patients with dysferlinopathy is important. Nonsense suppression drugs, such as ataluren,22 which increases the expression of dysferlin in patients with dysferlinopathy, may be useful in establishing an effective combination therapy. Previous studies have reported that promoting sarcolemmal repair via a glucocorticoid steroid regimen improved muscle function in several muscular dystrophy mouse models, such as DMD, LGMD 2B, and LGMD 2C (caused by mutations in the gene encoding sarcoglycan).56,57 The novel concept of the dysferlin-AMPK complex involved in the plasma membrane-repair process may contribute to drug development for several types of muscular dystrophy.
A limitation of this study lies in the in vivo experiments, specifically in zebrafish and mice. Because AMPKa phosphorylation was variable across individual animals, there was no significant increase in the AMPKa phosphorylation. The variations between individual samples can be explained by the previous observation that AMPK in fish can be activated by metformin58 and exercise59 and that AMPK in mouse skeletal muscle can be activated by metformin60,61 and exercise.62,28 In this study, metformin in drinking water was administered to dysferlin-deficient mice from a drug-repositioning perspective. AMPK plays a role in energy homeostasis in not only skeletal muscles but also a number of tissues, such as liver, pancreas, and brain.63 It is necessary to consider a drug delivery system or genomic drug discovery (development of medicines using information about human genome) for muscle-specific AMPKa phosphorylation.
Overall, these results indicate a functional association between dysferlin and the AMPK-linked signaling pathways. Furthermore, this study sheds light on a new dimension of dysferlin as a membrane scaffold protein for several functional proteins. Further identification of the numerous molecules that form complexes with dysferlin is important for understanding the whole landscape of plasma membrane repair and developing novel therapeutic targets.

MATERIALS AND METHODS All protocols were approved by the Ethics Committees of the Tohoku University School of Medicine (nos. 2014-208 and 2018-196 for genetics; nos. 2014-216, 2015-170, and 2018-247 for animals).
Cell Culture Mouse C2C12 myoblasts (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with high glucose (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) at 37C and 5% CO2. HEK293T cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) containing 10% FBS. The immortalized myoblast lines used in this study are presented in Table S3. The immortalized dysferlin-deficient myoblast lines (line 107 and line 379) and control human myoblast lines (KM 155 and AB 1079) were cultured in growth medium comprising a 1:4 ratio (by volume) of Medium 199 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 2.5 ng/mL hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 0.1 mM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 50 mg/mL gentamycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), as described in earlier reports.27 Differentiation into myotubes was initiated at approximately 70%-80% confluence in DMEM with 2% horse serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
Plasmid Construction A human cDNA library was purchased from Takara Bio (Kusatsu, Japan). Amplified fragments of deletion mutants of dysferlin with additional SalI or XhoI sites at the 50 end and NotI sites at the 30 end were cloned into MBP-tag and pEGFP-N1 vectors (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan). The primers used in this study are presented in Table S1.
RNA Interference RNA oligonucleotides were transfected into C2C12 myoblasts using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, siRNA and Lipofectamine reagent were separately diluted in Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The diluted Lipofectamine reagent was added to the siRNA mixture and allowed to form a complex with the siRNA for 10 min. The lipid/siRNA complexes were then added to the differentiation medium, and myoblasts were incubated for 24 h in the medium containing the transfection mixture. The final concentration of siRNA was set at 10 nM. The siRNA oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table S2.
Pull-Down Assay and Nano-LC-MS/MS MBP-tagged DYSF-II, -II-1, and -II-2 were constructed in a pMAL vector (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) via PCR amplification and expressed in E. coli. Each cell lysate was incubated with amylose resin (50-mL volume; New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) for

1 h at 4C and washed twice with washing buffer A (50 mM Tris- HCl [pH 7.5], 0.3 M NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 [NP-40]), twice with washing buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5] and 1.0 M NaCl), and once with PBS. HEK293 cell pellets (4 g) were extracted in 5 mL of extraction buffer (50 mM HEPES [N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N02-ethanesulfonic acid] [pH 7.5], 0.3 M NaCl, and 0.2% NP-40) by sonication, and the extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4C. A 50-mL volume of MBP-tagged DYSF-II, -II-1, and -II-2 amylose beads was incubated with 1.5 mL of HEK293T cell lysate for 4 h at 4C. Following centrifugation for 2 min at 1,200 rpm, the beads were washed three times with washing buffer C (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.2% NP-40) and eluted with 0.6 mL of elution buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.5] and 1.2 M NaCl). The eluates were then concentrated down to 50 mL and desalinated by centrifugal filter devices (Amicon Ultra; Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA), and 2 SDS sample buffer was added. The samples were resolved on a 4%-15% SDS-PAGE gel and stained using a Wako silver stain kit (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan). Gel slippage was decreased by 100 mM DTT and alkylated with 100 mM iodoacetamide. Following washing, the gels were incubated with trypsin overnight at 30C. The recovered peptides were desalted in ZipTip C18 (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). The samples were analyzed using nano-LC-MS/MS systems (DiNa HPLC [high-pressure liquid chromatography] system, Techno Alpha, Tokyo, Japan; QSTAR XL hybrid LC-MS/MS system, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Mass data acquisitions were piloted using Mascot software.
Co-immunoprecipitation Assay C57BL/6J mouse skeletal muscle samples (40 mg) were ground into powder with a mortar and pestle under the constant addition of liquid nitrogen. The powder was suspended in a 15 volume of ice-cold lysis/equilibration buffer (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan) and centrifuged at 17,000  g for 20 min. The supernatants were incubated with an appropriate antibody and protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) for 1 h at 4C with end-overend rotation. The beads were washed with PBS three times and elution was performed in elution buffer (0.1 M glycine [pH 2.5]) with neutralization buffer (1 M Tris [pH 8.5]).
Immunoblotting Equal quantities of protein (20-mg samples) were boiled, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and electrophoresed at 200 V for 1 h. The gels were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). The membranes were then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4C. The membranes were incubated with an anti-mouse (#7076; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) or anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked antibody (#7074; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) for 1 h. Immunodetection was performed using the ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) Prime western blot analysis system (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA), and images were captured with an Omega Lum G (Gel Company, San Francisco, CA, USA), in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions.

Immunofluorescence Frozen muscle sections were cut to a thickness of 10 mm, air-dried, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Following incubation with PBS containing 5% BSA, the sections were probed with primary antibodies. Following several washes with PBS, the sections were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h. The sections were mounted with a coverslip containing a drop of mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).
Antibodies Antibodies against the following proteins were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA): ACC (1:1,000 for immunoblotting, #3662), phosphorylated (phospho-)ACC (Ser79) (1:1,000 for immunoblotting, #3661), AMPKa (1:1,000 for immunoblotting, #2532S), AMPKa2 (1:1,000 for immunoblotting, #2757S), phospho-AMPK (Ser172) (1:1,000 for immunoblotting, #2531S), GAPDH (1:1,000 for immunoblotting, #2118), S6 (1:1,000 for immunoblotting, #2217), phospho-S6 (1:1,000 for immunoblotting, #4858), b-actin (1:1,000 for immunoblotting, #4967), and normal rabbit IgG (5 mg/sample for immunoprecipitation, #2729); from Abcam (Cambridge, UK): AMPKg1 (1:1,000 for immunoblotting, 5 mg/sample, for immunoprecipitation, ab32508), AMPKa1 (1:1,000 for immunoblotting, 1:1,000 for immunofluorescence, ab3759), dysferlin (5 mg/sample for immunoprecipitation, ab214078), GFP (1:1,000 for immunoblotting, ab290), red fluorescent protein (RFP) (1:1,000 for immunoblotting, ab62341); from Leica Biosystems (Nussloch, Germany): dysferlin (1:250 for immunoblotting, NCL-Hamlet); from Sigma (St. Louis, MO): dysferlin (1:250 for immunofluorescense, HPA017071); and from Medical and Biological Laboratories (Nagoya, Japan): RFP (5 mg/sample for immunoprecipitation, M208-3).
Ionomycin and Cc treatment In Vitro The cells were cultured overnight in the presence or absence of serum and were treated with or without 1 mM ionomycin (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan). The cells were cultured overnight in the presence or absence of serum and were treated with or without the AMPK inhibitor Cc (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; 5 and 10 mM) for 1-4 h.
In Vivo A total of 10 mL of Cc or saline was injected into the flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) of anesthetized, 3-month-old male C57BL/6J mice. Skeletal muscle myofibers were isolated 1 h after injection. The Cc-administered myofibers were cultured for 30 min in the presence of Cc (10 mM). The saline-administered myofibers were cultured for 30 min in the presence PBS (+).
AICAR and Metformin Treatment In Vitro The cells were cultured overnight in the presence or absence of serum and were left untreated or treated with the AMPK activator AICAR (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA; 1 mM, 1-9 h) and metformin (Sigma,

St. Louis, MO, USA; 2 mM, 8-12 h) 7-10 days after the initiation of differentiation.
In Vivo A previous study reported that the levels of phosphorylated AMPKa in mouse skeletal muscle at 20-40 min post-AICAR (250 mg/kg) injection were significantly higher than those at other time periods.28 To leverage that work, AICAR (250 mg/kg) was injected into the anesthetized, 18-month-old male BLA/J mice intraperitoneally, and FDB was isolated 20 min after injection. Two goals were established. To achieve AMPK activation, the FDBs were cultured in the presence of AICAR (2 mM) after isolation. Membrane-repair assays were performed between 20 and 40 min after the intraperitoneal injection of AICAR. In the control group, the FDBs were cultured for 40 min in a PBS (+) buffer following isolation. Membrane-repair assays were performed between 60 and 80 min after AICAR was administered.
Membrane-Repair Assay In Vivo Transfection A total of 20 mg of Venus-tagged human dysferlin, DsRed-tagged human AMPKg1, GFP-tagged human AMPKg1, and AMPKa1/ AMPKa2 were injected into the FDB of anesthetized, 3-month-old male C57BL/6J or BLA/J mice. Electroporation of the plasmid DNA was performed using an electric pulse generator (CUY21SC; Nepa Gene, Ichikawa, Japan). Skeletal muscle myocytes (for whole-mount viewing) or individual myofibers were isolated 14 days after the electroporation.
Membrane-Repair Assays Membrane-repair assays were performed as described in a previous report.8 Briefly, membrane damage was induced in the presence of the FM1-43 or FM4-64 dye (2.5 mM; Molecular Probes) using a two-photon confocal laser-scanning microscope with 40 magnification and 1.2 numerical aperture (LSM710NLO; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) coupled to a 10-W Argon/Ti:sapphire laser. A circular area (2-6 mm in diameter) in the injury site was selected along the edge of the sarcolemma and irradiated at 1.5  0.2 mW, which was measured by a photodiode sensor (PD300-3W; Ophir Optronics, Jerusalem, Israel). Images were captured beginning at 20 s before (t = 0) and for 2-4 min after irradiation at 10-s intervals. For every image captured, the fluorescence intensity at the damage site was measured using Zeiss LSM 710NLO imaging software.
Zebrafish Experiments Fish Culture Zebrafish (the AB line) were cultured at 28.5C in accordance with standard procedures and standard criteria.64 Fertilized eggs were collected and used for injection. For anesthesia and euthanasia, tricaine solution was used.
MO Injections An antisense MO targeted to disrupt the splicing of dysferlin mRNA was designed by Gene Tools (Philomath, OR, USA). The morpholino

sequence for dysferlin MO was 50-CAGCATGGGAATAAACT CACCTGGT-30. The morpholinos (1.5 ng) were injected into the yolk of one- to two-cell-stage embryos. For the injection control, CMO was used (standard control oligonucleotide; Gene Tools, Philomath, OR, USA): 50-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTAT-30. To confirm the effect of the morpholino injections, zebrafish total RNA was extracted from embryos at 4 dpf using an RNeasy micro kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and was converted to cDNA (SuperScript III; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). To detect misspliced products, PCR was performed with ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan) at 95C for 30 s, 55C for 30 s, and 72C for 30 s for 35 cycles with the following primer sets: dysferlin for exon 4, forward, 50-GGACCTGAAGGGTGT TCCTT-30, reverse, 50-TGTGACTGTGTCCAGCTCCA-30; and b-actin, forward, 50-CGGTTTTGCTGGAGATGATG-30, reverse, 50-CGTGCTCAATGGGGTATTTG-30.
Detection of Muscle Phenotype of Morphants by Birefringence A birefringence assay was performed to detect abnormal skeletal muscle structures by placing anesthetized fish on a polarizing filter and subsequently covering them with a second polarizing filter.65 The filters were placed on an underlit dissection scope and the top-polarizing filter was twisted until only the light refracting through the striated muscle was visible. Because the degree of birefringence is affected by the horizontal orientation of the fish, the fish were oscillated back and forth to account for differences in positioning.
Long-Term Mouse Experiments All mice were handled according to the approved animal protocols of our institution. The gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles were dissected from female SJL (SJL/JOrllcoCrj) mice (n = 20; Charles River Laboratories, Yokohama, Japan). Prior to this study, the muscles of both strains of mice were examined to investigate the muscular pathology and progression of myopathy.66 BLA/J (B6.A-Dysfprmd/ GeneJ) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA).
Metformin Administration Study A total of 20 SJL/J mice were randomized to receive vehicle (n = 10) or 5 mg/mL metformin (n = 10), and 10 BLA/J mice were randomized to receive vehicle (n = 5) or 5 mg/mL metformin (n = 5).
Determination of CK Levels Blood (10 mL) was collected in Eppendorf tubes via cardiac puncture under deep anesthesia and was allowed to clot at room temperature prior to centrifugation and serum collection. Determination of the level of CK was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions using a standard spectrophotometric method. The data were expressed as units per liter.
Functional Tests Grip strength of the forearms was assessed using a grip strength meter (GPM-100; MelQuest, Toyama, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three forelimb strength measurements were re-

corded in the morning by an investigator blinded to the treatment conditions. The average grip strength measured each day was used for the subsequent analysis.
Tissue Preparation The gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles were collected individually using standard dissection methods and cleaned of excess fat, connective tissue, and tendons. Several muscles were frozen in isopentane that was cooled by liquid nitrogen for histological and immunohistochemical analyses, whereas the other muscles were frozen directly in liquid nitrogen for protein extraction and stored at 80C.
Immunoblotting Skeletal muscle protein was extracted from the mouse hindlimb muscle samples for immunoblot analysis, as described previously.67
Total Collagen Quantification Frozen gastrocnemius muscles (30-mg portions) were transferred into a Sarstedt tube, and following addition of 600 mL of 6 M HCl, they were hydrolyzed by overnight incubation at 95C in a heat block. Upon hydrolysis, without any pretreatment, 35 mL of it was used for collagen quantification using a QuickZyme total collagen assay system (QuickZyme Biosciences, Leiden, the Netherlands), and 15 mL was used for the QuickZyme protein assay (QuickZyme Biosciences, Leiden, the Netherlands), which has specifically been developed for protein analysis in acid hydrolysates. The protein data were used for normalization of the unknown quantity of tissue used for hydrolysis.
H&E Staining Several cryosections of 10 mm were cut in the middle of the muscle belly to obtain the largest myofiber diameter and were then placed on poly-L-lysine-coated slides, air-dried, and stained with H&E. The sections were viewed and photographed using an Olympus digital camera system (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
Histological Analysis of Internal Nuclei Internal nuclei were counted from approximately 200 fibers in at least three separate regions by an investigator blinded to the treatment conditions.
Histological Analysis of Muscle Cross-Sectional Area (CSA) The muscle CSA was determined using Keyence software (Keyence, Osaka, Japan) to manually trace the circumference of individual fibers. CSA analysis of the muscle was calculated from approximately 5,000 fibers per mouse by an investigator blinded to the treatment conditions.
IgG Immunohistochemistry IgG staining was used for intracellular IgG [IgG (H+L)] to determine muscle damage. After fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, gastrocnemius muscle sections were stained with an Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, A-11001; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) solution in 2% BSA for 2 h at room temperature, washed in

PBS, and mounted with coverslips. Images for IgG staining were taken using a Keyence BZ-X710 (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). 3-4 region of interest images were consequently chosen for each muscle section. All images were analyzed using Keyence software (Keyence, Osaka, Japan) by an investigator blinded to the treatment conditions. The IgG-positive and IgG-negative fibers were individually quantified and then calculated as a percentage of total fibers for each group.
Statistical Analysis The significance of differences was determined using the Wilcoxon test (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8; Figures S5, S7-S10, and S12-S14) and ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test (Figure 7). Data are expressed as mean  SE. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

TAFRO (thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin myelofibrosis/renal insufficiency, and organomegaly) syndrome is a systemic inflammatory disease sharing some features with Castleman disease and POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes) syndrome in relation to abnormal secretions of interleukin 6 and vascular endothelial growth factor. The kidney is a main target organ of TAFRO syndrome but the kidney histopathology associated with TAFRO syndrome is yet to be completely defined. We report 3 TAFRO syndrome cases with different clinical courses in which kidney biopsies were performed. In all 3 cases, kidney biopsies showed similar glomerular lesions of diffuse global swelling of the endothelium and expansion of subendothelial spaces, consistent with severe glomerular endothelial injury. Case 3 showed an additional finding of focal tubulointerstitial injury characterized by marked plasma cell infiltration, which was absent in the other 2 cases. Clinical symptoms in cases 1 and 2, which had lower disease severity scores of TAFRO syndrome, were effectively treated with the administration of corticosteroids or a combination of corticosteroids and cyclosporine A. Case 3, with a higher disease severity score, had an aggressive clinical course that was refractory to corticosteroids and tocilizumab; the patient ultimately died of multiple organ failure. In all 3 cases, kidney biopsy provided indications for the diagnosis process and clinical management of TAFRO syndrome.

INTRODUCTION
TAFRO syndrome is a life-threatening systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia (T), anasarca (A), fever (F), reticulin myelofibrosis/renal insufficiency (R), and organomegaly (O). Patients with TAFRO syndrome often exhibit acute, progressive, and critical clinical courses.1 The clinical symptoms of TAFRO syndrome are similar to those found in patients with idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease, which shows lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia. Excessive production of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which induce endothelial cell injury and vascular permeability, respectively, may be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of organ damage in both TAFRO syndrome and Castleman disease.
The kidney is a well-known target organ of TAFRO syndrome. However, kidney histopathologic findings of TAFRO syndrome are not sufficiently described because severe thrombocytopenia occasionally occurs, making it difficult to perform kidney biopsies in patients with TAFRO syndrome. Accordingly, only a limited number of cases have been reported in relation to clinicopathologic correlations in patients with TAFRO syndrome. We report the kidney histopathologic findings in 3 cases of TAFRO syndrome, which showed different clinical courses.

CASE REPORTS
Case 1
A man in his 30s was referred for a 1-month history of fatigue. He presented with hypertension (blood pressure, 176/117 mm Hg), swelling of the right axillary lymph node, and edema in limbs. Laboratory examination showed the followimg values: platelet count, 185,000/L; serum C-reactive protein (CRP), 11.6 mg/dL; serum creatinine (Scr), 1.92 mg/dL; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 35 mL/min/1.73 m2; serum IL-6, 44.7 pg/mL; and serum VEGF, 1,510 pg/mL. Urinalysis showed urinary protein excretion of 1.81 g/d and a red blood cell count in urinary sediment of more than 100 cells/high-power field. Kidney biopsy was performed on day 2 of hospitalization (Fig 1A-C). TAFRO syndrome was diagnosed based on 3 major and 2 minor criteria, with a severity score of 5 of 12 points.1 He required hemodialysis for acute kidney injury; however, with oral corticosteroids, serum CRP and Scr levels immediately decreased, followed by his platelet count gradually recovering, with a minimal count of 26,000/L on day 26 (Fig 2A). His platelet count recovered to 200,000/L at 5 months.
Case 2
A man in his 50s was admitted for a 1-month history of low-grade fever. He presented with hypertension (blood

pressure, 177/109 mm Hg) and moderate edema in limbs with a platelet count of 139,000/L, serum CRP level of 9.54 mg/dL, Scr level of 1.20 mg/dL, eGFR of 50 mL/ min/1.73 m2, serum IL-6 level of 7.0 pg/mL, and serum VEGF level of 783 pg/mL. Urinalysis showed urinary protein excretion of 1.31 g/d and no significant microscopic hematuria. Kidney biopsy was performed on day 5 of hospitalization (Fig 1D). TAFRO syndrome was diagnosed based on 3 major and 4 minor criteria, with a severity score of 5 of 12 points.1 Oral corticosteroids combined with cyclosporine A were administered, resulting in a gradual improvement in platelet count, with a minimal count of 12,000/L on day 75. He was discharged on day 118 (Fig 2B). His platelet count recovered to 230,000/L at 5 months
Case 3
A man in his 50s presented with a 1-week history of cough and fever. He showed high body temperature of 38.8 C and moderate edema in limbs without hypertension on admission. Laboratory examination showed thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 30,000 /L), serum CRP level of 26.5 mg/dL, Scr level of 1.10 mg/dL, eGFR of 57 mL/ min/1.73 m2, and serum IL-6 level of 89.0 pg/mL. Urinalysis showed urinary protein excretion of 0.37 g/g creatinine and no significant microscopic hematuria. Computed tomography showed bilateral pleural effusion, ascites, and enlargement of axillary and inguinal lymph nodes. He had acute kidney injury (Scr, 2.82 mg/dL, and eGFR, 20 mL/min/1.73 m2) and required hemodialysis because of diuretic-resistant volume overload on day 9 of hospitalization (Fig 2C). Kidney biopsy was performed on day 10 after a platelet transfusion (Fig 1E and F). TAFRO syndrome was diagnosed based on 3 major and 3 minor criteria, with a severity score of 9 of 12 points.1 Corticosteroid therapy did not improve his general condition. Hypotension was observed on day 14, and noradrenaline was administrated. Despite additional treatments with intravenous methylprednisolone pulse followed by tocilizumab, his general condition worsened and he died of multiple organ failure on day 24.
DISCUSSION
We have presented 3 cases of TAFRO syndrome with kidney involvement. Kidney histopathology in all 3 cases consistently showed severe glomerular endothelial injury, as evidenced by diffuse global endothelial cell swelling and enlarged subendothelial spaces. The findings of thrombotic microangiopathy (in case 1) and mesangiolysis (in cases 1, 2, and 3) identified in the biopsies further support that the endothelium, especially the glomerular endothelium, is the main target of kidney injury in TAFRO syndrome. In addition to the severe glomerular endothelial injury, the kidney biopsy in case 3, which had a higher disease severity score, also featured focal tubulointerstitial injury associated with plasma cell infiltration, which was absent

in the other 2 cases with lower disease severity scores. To our knowledge, biopsy findings of TAFRO syndrome have been reported in 14 cases, all of which, including our cases, consistently demonstrated findings suggesting marked glomerular endothelial cell injury (Table 1).2-15
Castleman disease and POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder, and skin changes) syndrome are considered to be similar pathologic entities to TAFRO syndrome, and abnormal secretion and biological actions of IL-6 and VEGF may be involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases. In animal experiments, overproduction of IL-6 induces endothelial cell injury, whereas VEGF is known to increase vascular permeability.16 Approximately 50% and 40% of cases of Castleman disease and POEMS syndrome, respectively, show glomerular endothelial cell injury.17,18 Serum IL-6 and VEGF levels increased in most patients with TAFRO syndrome previously diagnosed.1 In the cases of TAFRO syndrome with kidney involvement presented here, serum IL-6 and VEGF levels were elevated in all 3 cases and in 2 cases (because serum VEGF was not measured in case 3), respectively. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that IL-6 and/or VEGF are responsible for kidney involvement in TAFRO syndrome, which is mainly attributed to glomerular endothelial injury.
VEGF is constitutively secreted by podocytes and crucially involved in the development and maintenance of the glomerular endothelium.19 Podocyte-specific VEGF conditional knockout mouse models and patients with preeclampsia or those undergoing anti-VEGF therapy have shown glomerular endotherial damage similar to that in the present cases with TAFRO syndrome.19,20 In patients with preeclampsia, increased soluble FLT-1 (VEGF receptor 1) functions as a potential antagonist of VEGF. Although circulating VEGF levels increase in patients with TAFRO syndrome and Castleman disease, some case reports showed that glomerular VEGF expression decreased, which may have led to glomerular endothelial injury.7 This is controversial, and further research is needed to clarify the mechanism underlying glomerular endothelial injury in TAFRO syndrome.
Currently, the ideal treatment strategy for patients with TAFRO syndrome is unestablished. High-dose corticosteroids, tocilizumab, siltuximab (anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody), cytotoxic chemotherapies, and cyclosporine A are commonly used, but these therapies often result in treatment failure and relapse.21 Case 1 responded to corticosteroid monotherapy and case 2 was effectively treated by a combination of oral corticosteroids and cyclosporine A.
However, case 3 was refractory to intensive therapy including corticosteroids and tocilizumab, even though the patient's serum IL-6 level was high. Similarly, cases resistant to tocilizumab therapy have been reported.22 This has led to the assumption that humoral factors other than IL-6 are involved in the pathogenesis of TAFRO syndrome.

Treatments targeting humoral factors, such as plasma exchange and targeted therapies for molecules other than IL-6, may be considered as alternative strategies for some patients with TAFRO syndrome, especially for those showing severe clinical manifestations. Consistent with this idea, successful treatment using rituximab and plasma exchange has been reported in a previous case of TAFRO syndrome.23
The factors that determine the prognosis of TAFRO syndrome are unknown. Disease severity scores for TAFRO syndrome are based on the combination of thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin myelofibrosis/renal insufficiency, organomegaly, and other clinically identifiable findings.1 Despite all 3 cases showing severe glomerular endothelial injury, we could not determine differences in the severity of glomerular lesions. Instead, tubulointerstitial injury with marked plasma cell infiltration was identified only in case 3, which showed a higher disease severity score. Although tubulointerstitial nephritis involved in TAFRO syndrome cases has not been found to be associated with poor prognosis,6,9,11 no report has yet described tubulointerstitial infiltration of massive plasma cells. Plasma cell infiltration in the kidney implies that plasma cells infiltrate other organs as well, and this might reflect the severity and poor prognosis of TAFRO syndrome.
In summary, we discussed 3 cases of diagnosed TAFRO syndrome in patients who underwent kidney biopsy and showed different clinical courses. Lesions indicating severe glomerular endothelial cell injury were consistently identified in all 3 cases. Focal tubulointerstitial infiltration of plasma cells was identified in 1 case, which showed an aggressive clinical course. In all cases, kidney biopsy findings provided useful information that supported the diagnosis of TAFRO syndrome and the determination of the treatment strategy. Further accumulation of cases is required to elucidate the pathophysiologic basis of kidney involvement in TAFRO syndrome.

ABSTRACT
Swine eperythrozoonosis or porcine hemoplasmosis is an infectious disease caused mainly by Mycoplasma suis and is distributed worldwide. This study investigated the occurrence of porcine hemothropic mycoplasmas (PHMs) in fetuses and sows with reproductive failure. Two hundred and seventy-six samples (80 sows' blood and 196 fetal tissue samples) from 27 farms with reproductive disorders were evaluated. The PHMs DNA was detected in 15 out of 80 (18.7%) sows but it was not detected in the fetuses. The bacterial load ranged from 1.32  102 to 2.61  105 copies/킠. From the 27 tested herds, 11 (40.7%) showed at least one positive sow per farm. The majority of the reproductive problems observed in PMHs positive sows were stillborn fetuses (46.7%) and stillborn associated with fetal mummification (26.7%). So, we evidenced that porcine hemoplasmas circulate among sows in Brazilian herds, however, its real impact on reproductive problems remains unknown.

1. Introduction
Porcine Hemotropic Mycoplasmas (PHMs), namely Mycoplasma suis Mycoplasma parvum and `Candidadus M. haemosuis' have been described affecting swine red blood cells (Fu et al., 2017; Kinsley, 1932; Splitter, 1950). Mycoplasma suis is the most common species affecting pigs, which presents itself under the clinical or sub clinical form (Hoelzle, Zeder, Felder & Hoelzle, 2014; Stadler et al., 2014). The clinical signs include icterus anemia, fever, and decrease of reproductive performance, lead ing to increased stillbirth rates and dysgalactia (Brissonnier et al., 2020; Henry, 1979; Strait, Hawkins & Wilson, 2012). On the other hand, chronic or sub clinically infected animals do not show specific signs, contributing to the spread of the disease and its underdiagnosis (Ritz mann, Grimm, Heinritzi, Hoelzle & Hoelzle, 2009).
Regarding PHMs diagnosis, these pathogens used to be detected by blood smear and conventional PCR. However, nowadays, the molecular detection of their DNA by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) has been commonly applied, due to its high sensitivity and specificity (Guimaraes et al., 2011; Hoelzle et al., 2007). Still, the detection of PHMs through qPCR has shown that a high percentage of positive animals presented

bacterial loads lower than 104 copies/uL, which could be associated to the chronic infection of the disease (Gatto et al., 2019).
Even though PHMs infections have been described in several coun tries, some clinical aspects regarding their impact on reproductive per formance of sows are still unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of PHMs in sows with reproductive failure, as well as in their fetuses.
2. Material and methods
Twenty-seven farms located in Southern Brazil (22 from Santa Cat arina State and five from Parana State) from nine municipalities were previously selected based on their reproductive parameters. The farms included in this study presented at least one of the following indexes: abortion rate >4%, return to estrus >15%, fetal mummification >15% and stillbirth >10% (Table 1). The sows were vaccinated against porcine parvovirus, erysipelas, leptospirosis and porcine circovirus type 2.
Whole blood samples with EDTA were collected from 80 sows, in addition to the spleen (88 samples) and liver (108 samples) from mummies and/or stillbirths born from these sows. In total, 276 samples

were evaluated. DNA extraction from whole blood samples was per formed using the Illustra Blood Kit (Cytiva - formerly GE Healthcare, USA) and from tissues was carried out with phenol:chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation protocol.
The quantitative TaqMan real-time PCR (qPCR) was run as previ ously described (Guimaraes et al., 2011). A known M. suis-positive 16S rRNA gene (~1400pb) from a splenectomized piglet was gently pro vided by Dr. A.M.S. Guimara~es and employed as PCRs positive control. For its use in qPCR, the 16S rRNA gene was cloned using a TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). The number of copies of the cloned plasmid was calculated according to Yun et al. (2006) . Ten-fold dilutions of M. suis plasmid were used to build the standard curve, from 3.28  109 up to 3.28  100 copies/킠. Other Mycoplasmas (M. hyopneumoniae, M. hyorhinis e M. flocculare) along with a negative sample for M. suis, were used as PCRs negative control.

3. Results
In the qPCR, 15 out of the 80 sows' blood samples (18.75%) were positive, with bacterial load ranging from 1.32  102 to 2.61  105 copies/킠 (Table 1). Quantification values (Sq) of the qPCR assay ranged from 3.28  109 to 3.28  102 copies/킠, with a linear correlation (R2) of 0.993, slope of - 4.14, and average cycle of quantification (Cq) values ranging from 8.33 to 37.60. All fetal samples were negative when tested in the qPCR assay.
Porcine hemoplasmas were detected in 11 out of 27 farms, distrib uted in seven different municipalities. Curiously out of the 15 positive sows, seven had reproductive problems associated with stillborn fetuses, four with stillborn and fetal mummification, two with abortion, one with fetal mummification and one with return to estrus (Table 1).

4. Discussion
In the present study, PHMs were detected in sows showing repro ductive failure, mainly stillbirths, in Southern Brazil. Stadler et al. (2019) also reported that M. suis-positive farms had significantly more stillborn piglets per litter than negative farms. Similarly, Brissonnier et al. (2020) observed an increase in stillbirths' rate in gilts positive for M. suis. However, as stated by Stadler et al. (2019) , the occurrence of stillborn piglets in M. suis positive farms must be cautiously interpreted

once other infectious and non-infectious factors could be present and were not evaluated on this study.
Regarding PHMs occurrence in Southern Brazil, Gatto et al. (2019) observed that PHMs are widely spread in commercial pig farms, with an overall occurrence of 79.7% in sows and 100% positivity on the tested farms. In addition, 88% of the tested samples presented bacterial loads between 101 and 104 copies/L, suggesting that most animals were chronically infected. Besides, as reported by Stadler et al. (2019) , the bacterial loads detected in sows and piglets were considerably higher than the ones found in the sows from the present study, which may have influenced the negative results observed in the fetuses.
Furthermore, in South Germany, Stadler et al. (2019) investigated vertical transmission of M. suis in 21 farms and observed 14.3% and 31.2% of blood samples positivity for pre-suckling piglets and sows, respectively. An interesting fact is that the majority of the positive sows delivered negative piglets. As stated by Henderson, O'Hagan, Hawe and Pratt (1997) , only a proportion of newborn piglets can be infected from the dam by uterine transmission, which may explain the negative results on fetuses observed in our study.
Considering the aforementioned information, it was not possible to relate the occurrence of reproductive failure in sows with the presence of PHMs in the fetuses, even though 73.4% of the positive sows presented high stillborn rates (>10%). However, PHMs were detected in most of the evaluated farms, which indicates that these pathogens are spread in the Southern Brazilian herds, although its real role in sows and fetuses should be clarified.
Ethical statement
This study only contains analysis on pig blood and fetal tissues of stillbirths and mummified fetuses. We assured that the care with pigs completely complied with Brazilian Animal Welfare laws, guidelines and policies.

abstract
Organic manures in combination with biochar might improve efficacy of biochar in improving soil functions related to hydro-physical properties and a field experiment was conducted over the course of two years with two levels of biochar @ 0 and 2tha1 and four levels of compost (100% recommended dose of N through farm yard manure, 100% recommended dose of N through vermicompost, 50% recommended dose of N through farm yard manure, and vermicompost each, and unfertilized control). Each treatment was replicated three times in factorial randomized block design (RBD). The objective of this research was to determine the effects of biochar and compost on soil hydro-physical properties, water use efficiency, monetary returns and yield of knolkhol (Brassica oleracea var. gongyloides L.) under sub-tropics of North West India. Compared with no-biochar, application of biochar significantly increased knolkhol yield by 7.8% and soil properties (infiltration rate, aggregate stability, maximum water holding capacity and hydraulic conductivity). Similarly, integration of compost significantly enhanced the soil water retention, aggregate stability, hydraulic conductivity and crop yield and gave highest infiltration rate, water retention, hydraulic conductivity and crop yield under M3 (50 % N through farm yard manure, +50 % N through vermicompost) treatment. Furthermore, synergetic positive effect of biochar and compost were noted for soil infiltration rate (4-38%), water retention (0.9-13.7%), aggregate stability (6-10.7%) and yield (6- 11.9%) over the sole application of compost. Combined use of farm yard manure, and vermicompost accompanied by biochar resulted in highest net returns and B:C ratio. Biochar in combination with farm yard manure, and vermicompost can enhance soil hydraulic properties resulting in increased crop yield and maximum monetary returns under subtropical conditions.  2021 The Authors.

1. Introduction
Biochar is a solid porous material that is rich in carbon content, has large surface area and cation exchange capacity (CEC), produced from pyrolysis process in oxygen limited environment (Hussain et al., 2017; Mansoor et al., 2020). Many studies have reported positive effects of biochar incorporation on crop performance and soil properties such as improved soilstructure, water retention, porosity, infiltration rate, bulk density and hydraulic conductivity (Laird et al., 2010; Herath et al., 2013; Abrol et al. 2016), which may lead to increase in crop yield (Basso et al., 2012; Carlsson et al., 2012; Herath et al., 2013; Mukherjee and Lal, 2013; Martinsen et al., 2015; Hansen et al. 2016; Blanco

et al., 2017). Mensah and Frimpong (2018) reported that the biochar amendment would improve the soil health by increasing the pH, water retention capacity, CEC, apart from the microbial flora. Simarani et al. (2018) demonstrated improve soil labile C, organic carbon and microbial biomass C in short term application of rice husk and palm kernel biochar amended plots over control in tropical acidic soil.
Adding compost would alleviate the soil structural quality by significantly reducing the compaction and increasing water content (Tiwari et al., 1998; Carter et al., 2004; Evanyloet al., 2008). To avoid high cost and unsafe effect of inorganic fertilizers use of compost would be a traditional and better management option. Zhang et al. (2014) noted that the incorporation of organic manures would significantly improve the root growth by modifying the soil physical properties. Biochar is rich in carbon content but do not provide the sufficient nutrients for nutrient exhaustive crops. Adding biochar along with chemical fertilizers and compost resulted in improved soil water retention (Abel et al. 2013), aggregate stability (Sun and Lu, 2014), more efficient use of nutrients (Major et al., 2009; Novak et al., 2009), increase in microbial biomass and activities which would promote the plant growth (Adekiya et al., 2018; Mansoor et al., 2020; Sadegh-Zadeh et al., 2018) over the sole application (Ippolito et al., 2016; Hagemann et al., 2017). In addition to its impact on soil parameters and plant growth biochar with compost or lime decreases leaching of nutrients and would improve the efficiency of compost (Major et al., 2009; Novak et al., 2009). Studies of hydraulic properties of soil are vital for understanding the water flow and change in physicochemical properties influenced by different management practices (Zhang, 1997). Structure stability, hydraulic conductivity, bulk density and water retention has been widely used to investigate the soil physical health and hydraulic properties (Reynolds et al., 2009; Castellini et al., 2019). Partial research has been conducted to evaluate the effect of compost and biochar on the soil hydraulic properties (Kammann et al., 2016). Ataallah et al. (2019) noticed reduction in soil loss and increase in aggregate stability in short term birchwood biochar treated plots. Knolkhol (Brassica oleracea var. gongyloides L.) is one of the important fast growing, short duration cole crop, and has originated from the coastal countries of the Mediterranen region. In India, it is highly grown as a vegetable crop in Jammu and Kashmir State having a large area and production of about 70,000 metric tonnes. Now a days, it has become popular in most of the other states as the whole plant is edible owing to its high nutritional value as 100 gm of edible portion would contain 92.7gm moisture, protein (1.1 gm), minerals (0.7 gm), Energy (25 calories), carbohydrate, Ca, vitamin A (3.8 gm, 20 mg, 36 I.U, respectively) (Cosic et al., 2013).
The sub-tropical zone of Jammu is characterized as hot summer and dry winter having low inherent fertility and water holding capacity. Hence, the objective of this work was to asses and maximizes the favorable effect of biochar and compost on crop yield, soil properties, water use efficiency and monetary returns. Our hypothesis was that application of biochar in combination with compost would improve the soil hydraulic properties more than the compost and biochar alone under the sub-tropical conditions.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Location, climate and soil
A field study was conducted for two years (2018 and 2019) at the Organic Farm Research Center (OFRC), SKUAST-Jammu (32400N Latitude and 78480E Longitude), Jammu & Kashmir, India. The location would represent the sub-tropical belt of Jammu which falls under the Agro-Climatic Zone 1 (Western Himalayan

zone) of the Jammu region of Jammu & Kashmir. The average rain-
fall was1200 mm, the mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures were 45 캜 and 2.8 캜, respectively. The experimental soil was sandy clay loam in texture; the available N, P, K, organic carbon was 196.7, 19.28, 175.62 kg ha1, 6.4 g kg1, respectively; the pH, EC, bulk density was 7.4, 0.24dsm1, 1.33gcm3, respec-
tively (Table 1).

2.2. Experimental details
The experiment was set up in a factorial Randomized Block Design (RBD) with three replications consisted of eight treatment combinations of biochar (2tha1) and (ii) no biochar (0 t ha1) along with organic sources of fertilizer i.e., 100% recommended N through FYM, 100% recommended N through vermicompost; 50% recommended N through FYM + 50% recommended N through vermicompost and unfertilized control. The net plot size area was 3. 6 m  2.6 m. Previousstudies have indicated a wide range (1 t ha1 to 15 tha1) of biochar application in the soil. We had selected 2 t ha1 of biochar, as it is expected to be economically viable, and also have a positive effect along with compost (Manolikaki and Diamadopoulos, 2017, 2019). The recommended dose of nitrogen for Knolkhol (80 Kg ha1) was applied through biochar, FYM and vermicompost based on mean nitrogen content of amendments (Table 2). The chemical properties of biochar and compost, which have been used in our study, are given in Table 2. FYM comprised of 0.36% of phosphorus, 1.15% of potassium and 0.5% of nitrogen; while vermicompost comprised of 1.83% phosphorus, 1.39% of potassium and 1.5% of nitrogen. The pH, EC of biochar (biochar: water ratio, 1:10) were 8.9 and 0.49 dsm1, respectively; total OC, phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen were 53.5%, 0.15%, 0.5%, and 0.09%, respectively; with bulk density of 0.28 g cm3 (Table 2). The biochar, FYM and vermicompost were applied to the plots three weeks before transplanting of the Knolkhol.

2.3. Production and characterization of biochar
Biochar was produced from the rice husk due to its high availability in Jammu region of India. The rice husk was packed tightly in the low-cost cylindrical metal drum (200 L capacity) developed by (Venkatesh et al., 2018) and modified by CRIDA (Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, Hyderabad). The conversion of rice husk to biochar was about 40-45%. The biochar was passed through a 2 mm sieve for making the soil application. The bulk density was measured by dividing the weight of the dry sample filled in 10 ml tube with the volume.

3. Results
3.1. Soil hydro-physical properties
3.1.1. Soil bulk density The effect of biochar and compost on soil bulk density was non
significant. However, addition of biochar and compost decreased the BD over the control (Table 3). Reduction in BD was highest in B1 and M3. By 1.5% and2.9 % compared with control.

2.4. Measurement of soil physical properties
The maximum water holding capacity of soil was determined by using Keen Rackzowski box method (Keen and Raczkowski, 1921); infiltration rate (IR) was measured by mini-disk infiltrometer and calculations were performed using the spreadsheet given (Decagon Devices, 2016); bulk density was determined from the undisturbed soil samples by the core method; aggregate stability by wet-sieving apparatus (Eijkelkamp); water use efficiency (kg/ mm ha) calculated using the formula WUE = Y/ET, Where Y = crop yield (kg/ha) and ET = Evapotranspiration during the entire growth period (mm).
2.5. Soil and manure analysis
The soil pH and electrical conductivity were measured in the 1:2.5 soil: water ratios by using a pH meter and EC meter (Jackson, 1967). Soil texture (Bouyoucos hydrometer method), organic carbon (Walkley and Black, 1934), available nitrogen content was determined using the alkali potassium permanganate method (Subbiah and Asija, 1956), available phosphorus was determined by Olsen's method (Olson et al., 1954) total organic carbon and total N of the biochar and compost were determined using an Elementary Analyzer (multi N/C 2100S, Analytikjena).

3.1.2. Infiltration rate Biochar and compost significantly (P < 0.05) increased the soil
infiltration rate (Table 3). Significantly higher IR (1.2 times) was noted with the application of 2tha1 biochar over no biochar. Among the compost treated plots, significantly higher IR was observed with FYM + VC(M3) by 2.1 times compared with the control. The IR increased in the order of M0 > M1 > M2 > M3. IRvaried from 0.153 cm to 0.487 cm with mean infiltration rate of 0.322 cm (Fig. 1). Interaction of biochar and compost was significant, and highest was noted in T4 (biochar  FYM + VC) treatment. An increase in IR of 1.11, 1.04, 1.88 times in B + FYM; B + VC; B + FY M + VC over FYM, VC and FYM + VC, respectively were observed. Similarly, the CI values have increased in all the treatments with respect to the square root of time over control (Fig. 2).
3.1.3. Maximum water holding capacity The data presented in Table 3 revealed that biochar and com-
post significantly (P < 0.05) increased the maximum water holding capacity. Biochar addition was found to retain maximum soil water content (6.6 %) over no biochar. FYM + VC (M3) was superior with a significantly higher MWHC compared to FYM + B (M1) and VC + B (T2) which were at par with each other, and were significantly higher than the control. The interaction of B and compost at B  FYM + VC gave significantly higher MWHC, followed by B  VC, and B X FYM combinations (Fig. 3) and ranged from 40.86% to 52.86.

2.6. Measurements of agronomic parameter
The plant height and knob diameter were measured at the harvest stage by using the five tagged plants of each plot. Yield was measured on the basis of plant total weight, while the yield per plot was measured as kg per plot and expressed as quintals per hectare.
2.7. Economic analysis
The total cost was calculated by considering the total expenditure involved in all kinds of operations as per the treatments per hectare basis and expressed as Rs ha1. The benefit: cost ratio was determined by dividing the net returns with the cost of cultivation for different treatments.
2.8. Statistical analysis
The statistical assessment of the performance treatments was made by the carrying out the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) of data based on the Randomized Block Design as described by Gomez and Gomez (1984). Based on the Least Significant Difference (LSD) values, the treatment differences were compared at p < 0.05 level of significance. Pearson correlation and linear regression analysis between different parameters were derived and tested based on t-test to further explore the relationship between different measured parameters.

3.1.4. Aggregate stability and mean weight diameter The data presented in Table 3 revealed that biochar and com-
post significantly (P < 0.05) increased aggregate stability and MWD. The AS and MWD were found to be significantly higher by 8.1% and 10% respectively, under the biochar amended plots compared to no biochar treatments. Significantly lower AS and MWD were observed under the control treatment relative to other treatments. Among the compost treatments, AS and MWD were found to be significantly higher under FYM + VC (M3) treatment, followed by M2 and M1 but these were significantly better compared to no compost application (M0). Based on Fig. 4, A significant interaction was observed in biochar and compost treatments and the highest MWD was observed in M3B1.
3.1.5. Hydraulic conductivity and water use efficiency The data presented in Table 3 showed that application of com-
post affected the HC significantly. Maximum HC was observed under the FYM + VC (M3) treated plots, followed by M2 and M1 which were at par, but were significantly higher over the control treatment. The interaction of soil amendments (biochar and compost) on hydraulic conductivity (HC) was found significant and application of FYM + VC with biochar gave significantly higher HC compared to the remaining treatment combinations (Fig. 5). The water use efficiency (WUE) was found to range from 60.31 kg/ha mm to 199.5 kg/ha mm. Addition of biochar improved water use efficiency (WUE) by about 25.9% compared to no biochar (Fig. 6). Similarly application of compost has increased the WUE over control. Maximum WUE was attained when FYM and VC were

applied together. The interaction effects indicated that the combination of FYM + VC with biochar has produced the highest WUE, which was 24.6% higher than the WUE observed under without biochar treatment (FYM + VC).
3.1.6. Plant height, knob diameter and yield The results showed that plant height, knob diameter and yield
of knolkhol were significantly influenced by application of different amendments (Table 4). The plant height ranged from 36.03 cm to 49.90 cm with mean plant height of 42.88 cm. The knob diameter ranged from 4.23 cm to 9.73 cm with mean knob diameter of 6.27 cm. The knolkhol yield ranged from 120.3 q/ha to 216.4 q/ ha with mean yield of 177.1 q/ha. Among different compost amended treatments, FYM + VC application was beneficial and has significantly improved the plant height, knob diameter and yield, followed by VC and FYM treated plots. Significantly lower yield was attained with control. Compared to application of the compost alone, addition of biochar has improved the grain yield by 1.48, 1.52, 1.63 times respectively under FYM, VC and FYM + VC treatments, respectively. The magnitude of increase in the grain yield was higher in FYM + VC with and without biochar over control which was significantly higher when compared to the yield obtained with the FYM and VC treatments. Maximum grain yield of 216.4 q/ha was attained by the combination of B  FYM + VC combination, while minimum was attained under B  FYM application (Fig. 7). The results indicated that compost integrated with biochar had a significant effect on the plant height,

knob weight and yield of knolkhol compared to the sole application of these amendments. Thus, the crop performance was found to decrease in the order of M3 > M2 > M1 > M0.
3.1.7. Monetary returns Application of biochar and compost increased both the net
returns and benefit-cost ratio over the control treatment (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9). The net returns has ranged from Rs.24523/ha to Rs.108732/ha with mean net returns of Rs.74295/ha. The benefitcost ratio has ranged from 0.90 to 1.70 with mean benefit-cost ratio of 1.31. The biochar addition gave 1.4 times higher net returns compared to without biochar treatment. Addition of compost gave net returns of Rs.108732/ha and benefit-cost ratio of 1.70 with application of FYM + VC, followed by the application of FYM and VC. The biochar in conjuction with the compost have provided maximum net returns over the compost application alone. The mixed application of B + FYM + VC (T4) gave 1.4 times more net returns over application of FYM + VC without biochar. The findings have obviously indicated that the biochar application with FYM and VC was highly beneficial in terms of the improved soil hydro-physical properties, WUE, monetary returns and yield of knolkhol.
3.1.8. Relationship between different parameters Estimates of correlation were derived between different pairs of
parameters and were tested for their significance based on t-test (Table 5). Based on the correlation analysis, it is observed that(i)

biochar over the no biochar (Table 3). The porous nature and high surface area of biochar might decrease the soil bulk density and increased the aggregate stability and water retention and reduced the evapotranspiration (Day et al., 2005; Ogawa et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2006). Other researchers (Dugan et al., 2010; Githinji, 2014; Abel et al. 2013; Mukherjee and Lal, 2013; Herath et al., 2013) have also reported a significant improvement in the soil physical properties with as low as 1% addition of the biochar. Abrol et al. (2016) have found a decreased bulk density with the use of biochar under the non-calcareous loamy sand soils. Similarly, Omondi et al. (2016) have observed that under the coarsetextured and low fertility soils, there was significantly higher

water holding capacity of about 15.1% and aggregate stability of 8.2% after the biochar addition. Herath et al., 2013; Laird et al., 2010 noted the positive effect of biochar amendment to soil on bulk density, porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity.
Results revealed that infiltration rate had a significant correlation with MWD (0.915*), MWHC 0.876* and HC (0.935**), an increase in soil water content and aggregation that would improve plantgrowth (Carter et al., 2004; Evanyloet al., 2008; Zhang et al. 2014). Adekiya et al. (2018) have noted that incorporation of biochar alone or in combination with poultry manure decrease the soil BD and increase the soil moisture and porosity. Both the biochar and compost application having numerous benefits such as (i)

the enhanced soil nutrient use efficiency; (ii) increased water holding capacity; (iii) increased carbon sequestration; (iv) reduced nutrient leaching, (v) reduction of fertilizer inputs, and (vi) stabilizing the soil structure (Liu et al. 2012; Agegnehu et al., 2015; Schmidt et al., 2014). Maximum aggregate stability, water holding capacity, infiltration rate, and hydraulic conductivity were attained under FYM + VC in combination with the biochar. This could be due to the reason that the organic amendments and biochar would act as the cementing materials for forming the stable soil aggregates.
When the biochar was incorporated into the soil, it was found to function as a suitable binding agent that would connect the soil micro aggregates to form macro-aggregates. This has also lead to an increase in the diameter of the soil aggregates of biochar amended soils (Cheng et al., 2006), and therefore, changes the pore size distribution and also the aggregate stability of a soil. Similarly, Lu et al. (2014) observed that rice husk biochar increased soil pore by 20% and aggregation by 8-36% might be due to retaining water in its small pores and assist water to infiltrate from the ground surface to the top soil after heavy rain (Asai et al., 2013) Abrol et al., 2016). Omondi et al. (2016) have also shown an increase in the aggregate stability of about 8.2% (n = 10) after the addition of biochar. Application of biochar along with the organic amendment has increased the cumulative infiltration and soil infiltration rate.

Our findings have demonstrated that the compared with no biochar, plant height, knob diameter and yield of knolkhol have significantly increased with biochar (Table 4). Compost application with biochar has exhibited more prominent role in improving the crop performance over sole application of compost, which could be explained by the fact that the porous structure and large surface area change the availability of nutrients and physical properties (Agegnehu et al., 2016) and soil organic matter (Abiyen et al. 2011). Maximum yield was attained with the treatment comprising of FYM + VC and biochar, while the minimum was attained under control. This was due to the reason that the incorporation of biochar and compost together would improve the nutrient availability of a soil. The results obtained in this study would agree with the findings made by Manolikaki and Diamadopoulos (2019), who found an enhancement in the plant growth with the addition of rice husk biochar and manures. Previous studied showed that biochar addition in coarse textured and degraded has the potential to increase the crop yield (Lashari et al., 2013; Jeffery et al., 2012) and field experiments (Manolikaki and Diamadopoulos, 2019). A rapid decomposition and mineralization of the organic fertilizers, with mostly released back to the atmosphere were found to require a repeated high dose and cost of manure application (Srivastava et al., 2014). The biochar would certainly act as a slow releasing fertilizer to the crop which would help in providing good growth to the plant. Significant correlations were found to exist among the soil aggregates, infiltration rate, hydraulic conductivity, maximum water holding capacity, water use efficiency and other parameters as influenced by the biochar, FYM and vermicompost application. Different parameters were found to have a significant correlation with knolkhol yield and monetary returns based on the study. This has indicated that an improvement in the soil hydraulic parameters due to an application of different combinations of FYM, vermicompost and biochar has resulted with higher knolkhol yield in different treatments. However, there is a need to standardize the relationships based on long-term studies under similar soil and agro-climatic conditions. Other studies showed that biochar inconjuction with manures enhanced crop growth, soil fertility and carbon sequestration due to its recalcitrant's aromatic and aliphatic compounds (Agegnehu et al., 2016; Solaiman and Anawar, 2015; Schulz and Glaser, 2012; Abiyen et al., 2011). Biochar and manure mixture would significantly increase the efficiency of organic com-

post by preventing the rapid decomposition and also the mineralization of organic materials under different tropical conditions (Lehmann et al., 2003). This could be credited to the ability of the biochar to increase the efficiency of the utilization of the nutrients that are present in both FYM and VC. Sandhu and Kumar (2017) have reported about an increased efficiency of the biochar

with compost and cover crop compared to the sole application. Highest net returns and B:C ratio were attained under the plot that has received FYM + VC in conjunction with biochar over control (Fig. 9-10). Wang et al., (2018) have concluded that the amended biochar application gave an increase in the net returns by 41- 78% for rice and 34-77% for wheat based on a study of six years.

5. Conclusion
The results based on our study have indicated that the biochar addition with compost have positive effect on soil hydro-physical properties, water use efficiency, crop yield and the monetary returns under the sandy clay loam soil in the sub-tropical conditions. The farmers can profitably produce knolkhol without using the chemical fertilizers and harming the soil ecosystem with respect to an improvement in the soil bulk density, water retention, aggregation and crop growth.

ABSTRACT
Introduction and importance: Hydatid disease, caused by the zoonotic parasite Echinococcus granulosus, presents as cysts most commonly in the liver and the lungs. A hepato-pleural fistula is considered one of its complications and surgery remains the mainstay of treatment. A simultaneous invasive thoracic and abdominal access is routinely needed which is accompanied by increased morbidity and mortality. Case presentation: In this case report, we present an innovative, less invasive, non-classical approach. Clinical discussion: We introduce a successful transabdominal transdiaphragmatic laparoscopic technique for the management of a hepato-pulmonary fistula secondary to hydatid disease of the liver. Conclusion: Compared to the classical method, this new surgical approach towards hepato-pulmonary fistula paves the way for minimally invasive surgeries to manage complicated hydatid disease with a lower mortality and morbidity, faster recovery and shorter hospital stay. The work has been reported in line with the SCARE 2020 criteria.

1. Introduction
Hydatid disease is considered a remarkable health problem world wide, mostly endemic in developing and underdeveloped countries such as the Middle East and Africa. It is caused by the zoonotic parasite Echinococcus granulosus [1] presenting as cysts most commonly in the liver (50-80%) and lungs (10-40%) [2]. Several complications of hy datid disease of the liver may develop, one of which is formation of a hepato-pleural fistula. Hepato-pleural fistula is considered one of the reported complications and includes the formation of a fistula between the liver parenchyma and the pleural space [3]. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment of hydatid disease, especially in established cases of hepato-pleural fistula [4]. It has been traditionally done through a trans-thoracic approach in addition to an abdominal access. However, it was associated with high morbidity and mortality especially in devel oping countries that have modest expertise in this field [1]. Recently, less invasive surgical approaches have been advocated for management of hepato-pleural fistula [5]. Here, we report successful transabdominal

transdiaphragmatic laparoscopic approach to manage liver hydatid cyst with hepato-pleural fistula yielding satisfactory outcomes. The work has been reported in line with the SCARE 2020 criteria [17].
2. Case presentation
We report a case of a 51-year-old female housewife who was referred from an outside physician to our clinic at the American University of Beirut Medical Center for intermittent episodes of dyspnea and nonproductive cough of 2 months duration. Patient reported no fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, chest pain, palpitations or hemoptysis. She also denied any abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, dysphagia, vomiting, jaundice, or tea colored urine/clay colored stools. Patient is also known to have hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus type II and is a former smoker. She does not have any past surgical history. To mention, this patient is an inhabitant of a rural area close to a farm in Lebanon.
On presentation, the patient was awake, alert and oriented to person, place and time. Physical exam revealed stable vital signs with decreased

breathing sounds on the right lower lung field with no wheezing. Her abdomen was soft, non-distended with no rebound tenderness or any peritoneal signs, and murphy sign was negative. Baseline investigation was unremarkable with normal complete blood count levels except for mild eosinophilia (5%), normal basic metabolic panel, liver function tests and coagulation profile. A plain antero-posterior chest radiogram (CXR) was performed showing blunting at the Right costophrenic angle (Fig. 1). Further evaluation with a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen/pelvis was done. CT revealed 2 large cystic le sions (measuring 7  8 cm and 10  7.5 cm) in the right lobe of the liver, communicating, and containing several irregularly shaped daughter cysts within the mother cyst, with no calcifications. Communication with the pleural space was noted with a right lower lobe consolidation. A suspicion of hydatid cyst was confirmed by a hydatid indirect hemag glutination test with a value >1:32768.
Patient was started on albendazole and was scheduled for laparo scopic evacuation of liver hydatid cyst with transabdominal trans diaphragmatic laparoscopic approach of the hepato-pleural fistula.
Intraoperatively, general abdominal laparoscopy was performed by a general surgeon specialized Liver Transplantation and Hep atopancreaticobiliary Surgery, through a 10 mm umbilical port. Respectively, a 5 mm trocar was inserted in the epigastrium, 12 mm trocar in the mid right sub-costal area (retrieval bag and scope if needed) and a 5 mm trocar in the lateral right sub costal area (Fig. 2). During inspection, two large hydatid peri-cysts were identified arising from the hepatic dome adhering to the supra-hepatic diaphragm. The cyst con tents were managed laparoscopically via closed circuit of tubing system by aspirating 100 cc of clear intra-cystic fluid and replaced by similar volume of hypertonic saline as a scolicidal agent. Using electrocautery, a small opening was done in the wall of the cyst that allowed introduction of the suction where the cyst was aspirated till dryness and repeatedly irrigated with hypertonic saline (Fig. 3). The peri-cysts were divided completely from the diaphragmatic surfaces. This allowed management of the hepatic hydatid by excising the fibrotic component of the pericysts, retrieving the membranes and thoroughly inspecting the poten tial existence of bile leak or cysto-biliary fistula (Fig. 4). Then, the intrathoracic component of the hydatid was managed via the diaphragmatic communication through the same abdominal approach, where the membranes were retrieved, and cyst cavity was irrigated and washed. There was definite pleural communication and erosion to the lower surface of the lower right pulmonary lobe with tiny air leak but no

the lung due to the inflammatory process. Drained specimen and tissue were sent out for pathology and the report could be seen in Fig. 6.
Postoperatively, the patient was doing well. Bilious drainage was noted on postop day 2, and a biliary leak was suspected. ERCP with sphincterotomy was performed to decrease biliary pressure, and a 10 Fr  10 cm plastic stent was inserted into the biliary tree. Drain output was followed up. At postoperative day 8, patient was doing well, and she was discharged home on albendazole, and the drain was removed.
3. Discussion
Hydatid disease is endemic in agricultural and animal raising soci eties especially in the Middle East. This disease carries significant burden on public health and economy [6]. For all cysts that are larger than 15 cm, those that are complicated or those that are not suitable for

interventional radiology (IR), surgical approach is the mainstay treat ment [6].
One of the major complications of the hydatid cyst of the liver is its rupture into the pleura and bronchial tree. This happens either due to the pressure from the expanding hydatid cyst leading to erosion into the diaphragm or from the destructive effect of a superimposed infection [7]. The most prominent sign is bilioptysis. However, often patients may have nonspecific respiratory symptoms for weeks or months, as the case of our patient. In the past years, different invasive surgical approaches have been used for hydatid cysts with a pneumo-biliary fistula. They comprise methods of gaining access either through the abdomen or through the lung, or both [8-10]. Transthoracic approach is the surgical method of choice via posterolateral thoracotomy; however, sometimes thoraco-laparotomy or thoraco-phreno-laparotomy is performed. On the other hand, reports of minimally invasive approaches have been pub lished like performing ERCP with micro-coils and ERCP with fibrin sealing [11,12].
Indeed, advancement of laparoscopic surgery provides a technical basis for minimally invasive surgery for hydatid cysts with less morbidity, rapid recovery and a shorter hospital stay compared to conventional open procedures [13,14]. There are no reported case re ports in the literature for the management of hepato-pleural fistula through a laparoscopic approach [15,16]. Here, we introduce a suc cessful transabdominal laparoscopic approach for the management of hepato-pleural fistula.
It is crucial to highlight that the understanding of the pathophysi ology of the disease allows for the feasibility of our presented surgical approach. This is due to the fact that when the hydatid cyst in liver erodes from the dome of the liver through the diaphragm, then the pleura and reaches the lung, it forms a fibrotic tract with no commu nication with the surrounding structures. This allows surgeons to reach the lung through an abdominal approach without injuring the biliary structures around it. Moreover, such an approach offers several advan tages. First, there is no need for posterolateral thoracotomy with this approach. Second, the use of laparoscopy will allow reduced length of incision and minimal abdominal trauma and abdominal adhesions. Moreover, during the surgery, the magnified view of laparoscopy and the use of trocars will reduce the complications such as bleeding and bile leakage and maximize the preservation of normal liver tissue [13]. In addition, patients can resume diet earlier after surgery and have a shorter hospital stay [13]. To note, verbal consent was provided by the patient for write-up of this case report.

ABSTRACT
Background: Common elements across different forms of addiction suggest the possibility of comorbid addictions, as well as the transition/replacement of one form of addiction with another. This study aimed to conduct a Network analysis of symptoms of 10 forms of addictive behaviors to examine their behavioral commonalities/ interrelations. Methods: To address this aim, an online community sample of 968 adult participants (33.6% women, 66.4% men) completed self-rating questionnaires covering a range of addictive behaviors including alcohol, drugs, tobacco, sex, online gambling, internet use, internet gaming, social media use, shopping, and exercise. Their responses were examined with regularized partial correlation network analysis (EBICglasso) and a community detection algorithm (Walktrap) to identify: (a) specific links between neighboring forms of addiction; and (b) clustering of symptoms of addiction. Results: Findings showed positive network connections across different addictive behaviors, with addictive tendencies towards gambling showing the highest centrality, sequentially followed by addictive tendencies towards internet use, internet gaming, alcohol, shopping, social media use, drugs, sex, smoking, and exercise. Conclusion: Symptoms associated with disordered drug use and gambling are suggested to maintain severity of addictive disorders and increase the likelihood of developing cross addictive behaviors. Clinical implications for the assessment and treatment of addiction comorbidities and the replacement of one form of addiction with another are discussed considering these findings.

1. Introduction
The last 20 years saw a paradigm shift in the conceptualization of addiction, suggesting that addictive behaviors can take place in alter native realms which may not necessarily involve the use of substances (i. e., behavioral addictions; APA, 2013; Burleigh et al., 2019; Demetrovics & Griffiths, 2012; Griffiths, 1996; Griffiths, 2005; Griffiths, 2017; Kardefelt-Winther et al., 2017; Sixto-Costoya et al., 2021; West & Brown, 2013; Wong et al., 2012). These include a range of diverse be haviors such as excessive online gambling (Griffiths, 1995; Montiel et al., 2021), hypersexual activity (Carnes, 1983; Krueger, 2016), problematic internet use (Anderson et al., 2017; Stavropoulos et al., 2013; Van Rooij et al., 2017), disordered gaming (Pontes et al., 2021; Stavropoulos et al., 2019), problematic social media use (Pontes et al., 2018; Schivinski et al., 2020), compulsive shopping (Andreassen et al., 2015; Mller et al., 2021), and problematic exercising (Beck Lichten stein & Jensen, 2016; Beck Lichtenstein et al., 2017).

Nonetheless, the acknowledgment and interpretation of such prob lematic behaviors as formal diagnostic categories of addictions has been a source of inconsistencies in the literature (Petry et al., 2018). For instance, while the World Health Organization (WHO, 2021) acknowl edges problematic gaming and gambling as official diagnostic classifi cations/ disorders, under the broader category of addictions, it does not enlist other similar problematic behaviors like the abuse of social media. In that context, recently proposed taxonomies introduce the notion of Internet Use Disorders to include addictive behaviors related to prob lematic internet use in general (Montag et al., 2021). However, concerns are highlighted regarding the risk of over-pathologizing such everyday life behaviors, which in some cases may even constitute one's efficient coping strategies (Kardefelt-Winther et al., 2017). To enhance the clarity in the field further, research has been invited (see for instance Internet Gaming Disorder [IGD], American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013).
Addressing such invitations, a growing body of research suggests that these addictive/problematic behaviors tend to co-occur rather than

present in isolation (Farr큖 et al., 2015; Haylet et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2018; Lorains et al., 2011; Martin et al., 2013a; M큖relle et al., 2017; Mller & Montag, 2017; Szabo et al., 2017). Indeed, research supports that predisposing factors such as depression (Xu et al., 2020), anxiety (Stavropoulos et al., 2017), maladaptive strategies (Ostovar et al., 2021), and adverse life experiences (Farr큖 et al., 2015), may act as an tecedents leading to the development and maintenance of co-occurring addictive behaviors (see also the I-PACE model explaining the rise of addictive behaviors, in particular in the online realm; Brand et al., 2016, 2019). Similarly, evidence indicates that commonalities across forms of addictions might act as a `gateway' increasing the likelihood of co morbid addictions (Burleigh et al., 2019; Rozgonjuk et al., 2021). For example, Delfabbro and King (2020) suggest that the `digital conver gence' of certain online activities facilitates the comorbid presentations of addictions in online environments (i.e., gambling, gaming, disordered internet use, etc.).
Additionally, empirical evidence suggests that common elements across different symptoms of addiction may increase the likelihood of developing cross-addictive behaviours in two important ways (Ford & Hkansson, 2020; Fuss et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2020). Firstly, common elements may facilitate a cycle of reciprocity, exacerbating the risk of transitioning from one addictive behavior to another (e.g., one abuses alcohol and while drinking progressively develops disordered gaming behaviors; Burleigh et al., 2019). Secondly, individuals may seek grati fication through alternative addictive behaviors while aiming to disen gage from a previously established addiction (e.g., drug abusers may substitute their use of substances with alcohol while aiming to abstain from the first; Brown et al., 2021; Haylett et al., 2004). Thus, there is a need to fully understand the degree of potential interrelation between different forms of addictions to be able to better address their comor bidities, as well as reducing the risk of addiction substitution.
To date, evidence for the interrelations between different forms of addiction has been examined via correlational analysis (Est큖vez et al., 2017; Montag et al., 2015; Mller et al., 2015; Mller et al., 2017), lo gistic regression (M큖relle et al., 2017), chi square (Martin et al., 2013b), and structural equation modelling (Lee et al., 2018), among other methods. While these methodologies enable researchers to understand the degree of relationship between constructs, several limitations can be outlined.
Firstly, these methods place emphasis on commonalities across different forms of addictive behaviors at the construct level. In other words, these methods view addictive behaviors as syndromes inclusive of various symptoms (e. g. disordered gaming with disordered alcohol use), rather than examining how distinct symptoms of different addic tions may link with each other (e.g., how preoccupation with gaming might relate with alcohol withdrawal; van Rooij et al., 2017). Secondly, these methods provide limited insight into the relative importance of certain symptoms of addiction compared to others (e.g., whether moodmodification is more central/ important compared to relapse and interpersonal conflicts for the diagnosis of pathological gambling). Lastly, these methodologies do not examine the potential `clustering' of distinct symptoms of different addictive behaviors (e.g., whether symptoms of online gambling sufficiently related to provide evidence of a form of behavioural addiction that is distinct from other forms of online disordered activity). These limitations can all be circumvented using a network analysis approach.
1.1. Network analysis (NA)
NA involves estimating relationships between variables/behaviors, without assuming the existence of a specific latent construct (e.g., an addiction syndrome), that can be visualized by a graphical model (Epskamp et al., 2018). A psychopathology network involves a set of variables/behaviors (i.e., nodes) that are connected through non-causal relationships (i.e., undirected edges; Borsboom & Cramer, 2013). This novel approach has been successfully employed in psychiatry/

psychology research to advance our conceptualization / definition of different presentations of psychopathology due to a series of attractive features (Borsboom & Cramer, 2013; Fried et al., 2017; van Borkulo et al., 2015).
Firstly, rather than emphasising interrelations at the construct level (e.g., gaming disorder), NA evaluates relationships between psychopa thology symptoms (e.g., gaming preoccupation, gaming tolerance and gaming withdrawal; Fried et al., 2017). At this point, it should be noted that the current dominant perspective in psychology/psychiatry sug gests that mental disorders are a reflection of a group of symptoms (i.e., reflective approach), and thus could be explained by a latent (or unob served) construct (Borsboom & Cramer, 2013). This implies that a construct is sufficient to explain the disorder and diminishes the importance of specific symptomatology (van Rooij et al., 2017). Alter natively, NA conceptualizes symptoms as mutually interacting and being the cause of the disorder (i.e., formative approach; van Borkulo et al., 2015). Thus, rather than only evaluating comorbidity between constructs, NA allows the examination of comorbidity of symptoms within and across disorders (Fried et al., 2017; Kendler et al., 2020). Such information may be particularly useful considering that comorbid symptoms across different disorders, alternatively known as bridge symptoms, can accommodate either the transition from one disorder to the other, or their co-occurrence (Epskamp et al., 2018).
Secondly, NA provides centrality indices (Hevey, 2018). Complex and heterogeneous networks can include symptoms/behaviours that are more important or central than others due to their relative position within the network structure (Rodrigues, 2019). Thus, while NA esti mates the strength of the relationship between symptoms, it also pro vides centrality indices to understand the importance of each symptom, or cluster of symptoms, exerts on the network (Hevey, 2018). For example, in public health responses to controlling an epidemic, identi fying individuals/events with high level of connections, or potential `super spreaders', provides an efficient means for targeted interventions (Pastor-Satorras & Vespignani, 2001). Similarly, in psychopathology networks, understanding the influence of a particular form of addiction (e.g., pathological gambling), and how that might vary across its composing symptoms/ behaviors (e.g., tolerance, preoccupation, with drawal etc.) could provide crucial knowledge to addressing addictive comorbidities and substitution behaviors (Borsboom & Cramer, 2013; Burleigh et al., 2019).
Finally, NA enables researchers to estimate `communities', or clus ters of nodes, according to their position within the network (Hevey, 2018). That is, nodes showing the shortest paths between one another will be clustered together forming communities (Fried et al., 2017). Using graphical features embedded in NA, researchers can visualize the taxonomy of structures, while enabling the identification of neighboring communities (Kendler et al., 2020). In psychopathology networks, communities of symptoms clustered together may either depict different psychopathological entities/ diagnoses and/or represent different co morbidity associations, providing insight into identification of behav ioral commonalities (Borsboom & Cramer, 2013).
1.2. Current study
Previous research has provided evidence of comorbid addictive dis orders (Delfabbro & King, 2020; Farr큖 et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2018; Lorains et al., 2011; Martin et al., 2013a; M큖relle et al., 2017), and has also suggested the possibility/ risk of substituting one form of addictive behavior with another, while trying to abstain from the first (Haylett et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2021). To the best of the authors' knowledge, only one study to date has explored the interrelations between a diverse range of different forms of addictions referring to online activities and their composing symptoms via network analysis (Rozgonjuk et al., 2020). However, the current study aims to address symptoms of addic tive behaviors related to online and offline activities.
The current study aimed to examine the network structure and

centrality of an extensive series of symptoms of addictive/problematic behaviors referring to the abuse of alcohol, drugs, tobacco, sex, online gambling, internet use, internet gaming, social media use, shopping, and exercise. It was further aimed to detect `clusters' of neighboring forms of the aforementioned problem behaviors. Identifying the network struc ture of manifestations (e. g preoccupation and/or withdrawal symp toms) of neighboring addictive/problematic behaviors (e.g., alcohol abuse and/or gambling) may assist clinicians in a twofold manner. Firstly, it could enhance clarity regarding the optimum taxonomy of a range of problematic behaviors in relation to formally classified forms of addictions, paving concurrently the way for more robust and effective differential diagnosis procedures (Griffiths, 2005; Haylett et al., 2004). Secondly, it may provide guidelines for more effective prevention and intervention practices, by helping professionals to timely identify and address central symptoms that may relate to higher risk for concurrent and/or prospective development of other addictive behaviors (e.g., higher tolerance to problematic gambling may relate to higher risk for the development of problematic social media use comorbidity more than gambling preoccupation).

Addictive Behaviors Reports 15 (2022) 100406
including use disorders targeting substance and non-substance areas expressed in online and offline environments (i.e., online gaming, online gambling, internet use, sexual behavior, social media use, shopping, exercise, alcohol use, drug use, and tobacco use). The measurements used in the current study included: the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale - Short Form (IGDS9-SF; Pontes & Griffiths, 2016); the Online Gambling Diagnostic Questionnaire (OGD-Q; Gonza큞ez-Cabrera et al., 2020); the Internet Disorder Scale - Short Form (IDS9-SF; Pontes & Griffiths, 2016); the Bergen-Yale Sex Addiction Scale (BYSAS; Andreassen et al., 2018); the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS; Andreassen et al., 2016); the Bergen Shopping Addiction Scale (BSAS; Andreassen et al., 2015); the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI; Terry et al., 2004); the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; Fleming et al., 1991); the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10; Cocco & Carey, 1998; Skinner, 1982); and the Cigarette Dependence Scale (CDS-5; Etter et al., 2003). All instruments showed acceptable internal consistency with Cronbach  ranging from 0.68 to 0.95 and McDonald's  0.88 to 0.95. Supplementary Table 2 presents a description of each instrument and their internal reliability indices.

2. Method
2.1. Participants
The initial sample comprised 1097 responses, with 129 responses deleted due to being considered invalid (i.e., preview-only responses, spam responses, potential bots, etc.). A normative sample of 968 adults from USA, UK, Australia, and New Zealand was studied. Only Englishspeaking adults (+18 y.o.) were eligible to participate. Participants' age ranged from 18 to 64 years (Mage = 29.54, SD = 9.35) and included 315 females (32.5%; Mage = 30.02, SD = 10.39), 622 males (64.3%; Mage = 29.46, SD = 8.93), and 31 non-binary (3.2%; Mage = 26.26, SD = 5.13). No significant difference in age across gender categories was observed, F (5, 962) = 1.489, p = .191. Most participants reported being White/Caucasian (61.5%), and about half of the participants state not to be in a romantic relationship (50.4%). Supplementary Table 1 includes detailed participant sociodemographic information. About a quarter of the participants completed at least high school (27.2%), and about a third of the participants reported to be employed full-time (34.2%). Missing values in participants' responses were assessed via Mice pack age in R Studio, and Little's test determined that missing responses were Missing Completely at Random (MCAR; 2 = 314.979, df = 281, p = .080; Van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). Table 1 presents addictive behavior information for the sample, and Table 2 presents a correlation matrix including addictive behaviors and age of participants.
2.2. Measures
Ten different instruments were employed to assess symptom severity

2.3. Procedure
Upon obtaining ethics approval (application number HRE20-169) from the Victoria University Human Ethics Research Committee (Mel bourne, Australia), the study was advertised via email (Victoria Uni versity student platform), and social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit) to adults in the general community. Eligible par ticipants (i.e., adults) were invited to complete an online survey via Qualtrics link including demographic questions and a battery of ques tionnaires related to the measures employed in the current study. A Plain Language Information Statement was made available upon accessing the link to ensure participant met eligibility criteria (i.e., adults), provided informed consent, and completed the survey voluntarily. Data was collected between November 2020 and January 2021.
2.4. Statistical analysis - NA
Following suggestions outlined in Epskamp et al. (2018), three steps were completed to estimate and evaluate a network of symptoms of problematic behavior: 1) estimation of statistical model; 2) analysis of network structure; and 3) assessment of accuracy and stability of network parameters (Epskamp et al., 2018; Rodrigues, 2019). Addi tionally, following suggestions outlined by Christensen et al. (2020), we included a fourth step to identify communities of nodes within the network structure. Steps one to three were conducted using Jeffreys' Amazing Statistics Program (JASP; JASP team, 2020), and step four was conducted using the EGAnet package in R Studio (Golino, 2021).
Step 1: Evaluation and visualization of networks involves the use of a Gaussian graphical model (GGM) in which edges can be interpreted as

partial correlation coefficients (Epskamp et al., 2018). Considering that the GGM can estimate polychoric correlations, it has been assessed as appropriate to deal with non-equidistant ordinal data (i.e., obtained through Likert-type scales; Fried et al., 2017). Due to the oftenunintelligible presentation of complex psychopathology networks, GGM with regularization techniques was employed to minimize spurious edges (Hevey, 2018). For example, the `least absolute shrinkage and selection operator' (LASSO) algorithm employs a tuning parameter () that minimizes the Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC) to estimate a `weighted' matrix (Epskamp et al., 2018). We employed the EBIC-LASSO to estimate our network, and thus shrink spurious corre lations to zero, and increasing the interpretability of the network.
Step 2: The analysis of a network structure can be determined by evaluating the weighted matrix and Centrality indices (Epskamp et al., 2018). The weighted matrix quantifies relationships between nodes while accounting for the strength of their relationship, with higher weights representing stronger relationships (Hevey, 2018). Addition ally, centrality indices (Strength, Betweenness, Closeness, and Expected influence) provide insight into the relative importance of a specific node in comparison with other nodes included in the network (Rodrigues, 2019). Degree (also called strength) represents a count of how many nonzero edges a particular node has, with higher counts implying higher importance within the network (Epskamp et al., 2018). Betweenness represents the average distance of each node to all others, and Closeness represents the inverse sum of all the shortest paths. In NA central (or influential) nodes will have higher frequency of short paths passing through (Hevey, 2018). Expected influence represents the sum of edge weights in weighted networks accounting for both positive and negative relationships between nodes (Robinaugh et al., 2016). This index aims to understand the cumulative influence a node has on a network, and thus assess the role it may play in the activation, persistence, and remission of the network (Robinaugh et al., 2016). Finally, identification of `bridge' symptoms (i.e., symptoms connecting with other forms of addiction) can be derived by evaluating the weighted matrix (Vanzhula et al., 2021).
Step 3: Two techniques can be used to evaluate the network accuracy: edge-weight accuracy, and centrality stability. Firstly, edge-weight ac curacy can be assessed by estimating 95% confidence intervals (CI) using non-parametric bootstrapped samples (Epskamp et al., 2018). Narrower CIs suggest a more precise estimation of edges. Secondly, centrality stability can be assessed by case-dropping subset bootstrapping (Epskamp et al., 2018). This involves dropping incremental percentages of observations (e.g., 25%, 35%, etc.) to determine whether centrality indices remain constant with each subset of observations (Epskamp et al., 2018). Correlation stability coefficients (CS) provide a measure to determine if centrality indices vary significantly between each incre mental case-dropping subset, with CS > 0.5 indicating appropriate sta bility (Epskamp et al., 2018; Forbes et al., 2021).
Additionally, a fourth step can be implemented to provide insight into the network taxonomy, and thus identify potential communities of nodes (Golino et al., 2020). While visualization of networks can be

obtained through the graphical EBIC-lasso (EBIC-glasso; Epskamp et al., 2018), exploratory graph analysis (EGA) can enhance visual identifica tion of communities within the network through a dimension reduction process (Christensen et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2016). In this context, EGA uses the Walktrap community detection algorithm within an EBIC-glasso framework to identify the optimum number of dimensions that may be present in the network (Christensen et al., 2020; Golino et al., 2020). The EGA approach has been described as superior to traditional dimension reduction techniques (such as exploratory factor analysis; EFA) because it does not require the researcher to make decisions about rotation of axis (Golino et al., 2020).
3. Results
3.1. Psychopathology network of addiction s
To investigate interrelations between symptoms of addictive be haviors, we used the EBIC-glasso with a tuning parameter () of 0.5 and 1000 non-parametric bootstrapped samples to estimate a network of symptoms of addictive behaviors. This included 79 symptoms of 10 forms of addictive behaviors including alcohol, drugs, tobacco, sex, online gambling, internet use, internet gaming, social media use, shopping, and exercise (Fig. 1). Of 3081 possible edge weights, 1112 were non-zero (36.1%), with 673 positive relationships (60.5%). Sup plementary table 4 presents the weighted edge matrix.
The strongest estimated positive edges were observed between BYSAS-2 (Felt an urge to masturbate) and BYSAS-3 (Used sex/masturbation to escape from personal problems; 0.62); between IGD-9 (lost a relationship because of online gaming) and IDS-9 (lost a relationship due to Internet usage; 0.48); and between BSMAS-1 (spent a lot of time thinking about social media) and BSMAS-2 (felt an urge to use social media more and more; 0.46).
3.2. Centrality indices
The standardized estimates of the centrality indices for degree, betweenness, closeness, and expected influence are presented in Fig. 2. Considering degree, the nodes with most connections were OGDQ-10 (asked someone for money due to gambling), AUDIT-6 (needed a first drink in the morning), and DAST-2 (abuse more than one drug at a time). Considering betweenness, the nodes with the shortest distance relative to other nodes were AUDIT-6 (needed a first drink in the morning), OGDQ10 (asked someone for money due to gambling), DAST-5 (feel guilty about drug use). Considering closeness, nodes with the highest inverse sum of shortest paths were AUDIT-6 (needed a first drink in the morning), OGDQ10 (asked someone for money due to gambling), DAST-7 (neglected your family because of drug use). Also see Supplementary Table 3 for detailed information about centrality indices discriminated by symptom.
Considering expected influence, nodes with highest sum of edge weights accounting for both positive and negative relationships were

Fig. 1. Symptoms of addiction network. The 79 nodes represent symptoms of 10 forms of addiction, and edges represent EBIC-LASSO regularized partial correlations. Blue edges represent positive relationships and red edges represent negative relationships, with wider and more saturated edges representing stronger relationships. Nodes were labelled and colored according to the form of addiction they theoretically represent.

OGDQ-11 (prioritized gambling over other areas), OGDQ-6 (feel guilty when gambling), OGDQ-10 (asked someone for money due to gambling). This suggest that gambling related symptoms might increase the likelihood of activating symptoms of other addictive disorders. Interestingly howev er, the least influential symptoms were DAST-3 (able to stop using drugs), CDS-3 (how soon after waking up you have a smoke), and AUDIT-1 (fre quency of alcohol intake).
Additionally, we calculated average centrality indices grouping symptoms by their corresponding disorders (see Table 3). Disorders arranged by descending centrality indices were `drugs', `alcohol', `online gaming', `online gambling', `internet use', `sex', `shopping', `social media', `exercise', and `tobacco'.
3.3. Bridge symptoms
Following suggestions outlined in Vanzhula et al. (2021), we sought to identify bridge symptoms that may connect or serve as pathways between disorders. Specifically, we observed (i) bridge strength or the frequency of connections between symptoms across different disorders, and (ii) bridge expected influence or the sum of positive weighted edges across disorders. As seen in Fig. 3, bridge symptoms with the highest frequency of inter-disorder edges are DAST-1 (used drugs for other than medical reasons), DAST-4 (had blackouts or flashbacks due to drug use), and OGDQ-1 (need to spend more and more money to get the desired high). Additionally, bridge symptoms with the highest sum of positive weighted inter-disorder edges are DAST-1 (used drugs for other than medical reasons), DAST-5 (feel guilty about drug use), and DAST-2 (abuse more than one drug at a time).
3.4. Accuracy and stability of network
To assess the accuracy and stability of our network, we evaluated the edge-weight accuracy, centrality stability, and tested for significant differences across centrality indices. Firstly, the accuracy of the esti mated edge-weights was evaluated with 95% bootstrapped CIs. Fig. 4 presents an illustration of the bootstrapped estimated edge-weight ma trix including 95% CIs. The relatively sized bootstrapped CIs suggests

larger variability in estimation of edge weights, and thus implies a certain degree of bias. Specifically, larger CIs represent a larger `shaded area' surrounding the mean bootstrapped estimated edge-weights (black line) and subsequently reduced confidence of `correct' estimation of edge-weights between a set of two specific nodes (Epskamp et al., 2018). Therefore, interpretation of results presented here should be done with care. Secondly, we employed the case-dropping subset bootstrap to assess the stability of edge-weights and centrality indices. Fig. 5 panels C and D, present the correlation stability (CS) coefficient between original edge-weights and centrality indices obtained with 100% of sampled people and progressive sample subsets with incremental drop in % of cases. Epskamp et al. (2019) suggests that CS coefficients should not fall below 0.25 and preferably above 0.5 for meaningful inferences. Our network showed average correlations in edge-weights CS > 0.75 (Fig. 5. C), closeness CS > 0.5, and betweenness and strength CS above 0.25 and slightly below 0.5. Thus, emphasis of interpretation was placed on closeness.
3.5. Visual identification of network communities
Finally, we implemented an Exploratory Graphical Analysis (EGA) approach to ease interpretation of potential communities within our network analysis. We used the Walktrap community detection algorithm within an EBIC-glasso framework to identify the optimum number of dimensions that may be present in the network (Golino et al., 2020). The EGA and EBIC-glasso estimate similar networks; however, emphasis of interpretation in our network estimated with EGA-Walktrap is placed on identification of communities. As seen in Fig. 6, the optimal solution suggests that nine dimensions are sufficient to explain interrelations between symptoms of the ten forms of addictive behaviors, with internet abuse and online gaming merged into one single construct.
4. Discussion
The present study aspired to expand the understanding surrounding comorbidities between addictions, as well as the transition/replacement of one addiction form to/with another. To address this aim we

implemented an innovative Network Analysis (NA) approach, while using a large, adult, community sample to concurrently examine the network structure and associations of a broad range of addictive behavior symptoms. These captured addictive behaviors related to alcohol, drugs, tobacco, sex, online gambling, internet in general,

internet gaming, social media, shopping, and exercise. The resulting network structure demonstrated relatively acceptable stability and ac curacy indices.
Overall, with the exception of disordered internet use and internet gaming disorder, findings indicate that all other forms of addictive

variability, despite the existence of common elements between the different addiction forms (Epskamp et al., 2018). From a diagnostic perspective, this reinforces their classification under a broader diag nostic umbrella of "addictive disorders/behaviors". Within this context, the strongest connections between manifestations of addictive behaviors were usually observed between symptoms of the same form of addiction. Indeed, this suggests that there are elements uniquely distinguishing the different forms of addictive behaviors assessed, potentially related to their different objects of interest (i.e., alcohol, substances, shopping etc.; Kendler et al., 2020).
This finding proposes that despite their inclusion within the same "family"/ diagnostic umbrella, these constitute different diagnostic en tities/ disorders that do not necessarily co-exist in terms of their expressed behavior. Reinforcing this hypothesis, our community detec tion algorithm (Golino et al., 2020) identified nine clearly distinguish able forms of addictive behaviors including excessive online gambling (Griffiths, 1995), hypersexual activity (Carnes, 1983; Krueger, 2016), internet abuse and disordered gaming (Griffiths, 1995; Stavropoulos et al., 2019), social media abuse (Pontes et al., 2018), compulsive shopping (Andreassen et al., 2015), and compulsive exercise (Beck Lichtenstein & Jensen, 2016; Beck Lichtenstein et al., 2017).
Importantly, these findings are in line with a series of studies sug gesting the need to recognize diverse forms of addiction/ problematic behaviors as specific disorders, rather than an overarching addiction diagnosis (Burleigh et al., 2019; Demetrovics & Griffiths, 2012; Griffiths, 1996; Griffiths, 2005; Wong et al., 2012). In other words, addictive disorders should be conceptualized as different sets of addiction symp toms that do not necessarily co-occur under a more diagnostically "loose" addiction entity (Borsboom & Cramer, 2013; van Borkulo et al., 2015). However, it is important to denote that disordered internet use and internet gaming behavior symptom networks mixed significantly, suggesting that further refinement in the conceptualization and differ entiation between these different addictive behaviors is needed.

behaviors assessed here are uniquely different. In other words, unique elements within each form of addiction provide evidence that justifies their classification as distinguishable addictive disorders, despite their overall similarities. Interestingly, particular symptoms related to gambling, drug and alcohol abuse displayed the highest levels of influ ence within the overall network of addictive behavior manifestations investigated. Of those, symptoms primarily related to drug abuse and disordered gambling were frequently and strongly connecting with other forms of addiction, increasing the potential likelihood of devel oping comorbidities or addiction substitution behaviors (i.e., bridge symptoms) between these disorders. As such, results may pose signifi cant implications for the taxonomy, prevention, and treatment of addictive behaviors.
4.1. Taxonomy of addictive disorders
Overall, the web/network of the broad symptoms of addictive be haviors assessed was relatively sparse, with only 60% of symptoms showing connections with another symptom. Not surprisingly, most of these connections were observed between symptoms of the same addictive behaviour. Indeed, the strongest associations between pairs of symptoms usually represented activities that were conceptually related. For example, feeling an urge to masturbate and using sex/masturbation to escape from personal problems showed the strongest association compared to any other pair of symptoms assessed within the greater network.
The relative sparsity of connections underpinning the network of addiction behaviors' manifestations investigated reflects their

4.2. Central and bridge symptoms of addictive behaviors
Centrality indices were used to evaluate the relative importance of different symptoms of addictive behaviors within the broader network of behaviors examined (Epskamp et al., 2018; Hevey, 2018). In brief, these indices aimed to identify symptoms which could underpin addic tion comorbidities, as well as addiction substitution or replacement. In this context, symptoms with more frequent connections and shortest paths included: asked someone for money due to gambling; needed a first drink in the morning; abuse more than one drug at a time; guilt due to drug use; and neglect your family due to drug use. These symptoms are related to disordered gambling, alcohol abuse and drug abuse, and present to have higher relative importance compared to other manifestations of addic tive behaviors. Similarly, symptoms showing stronger associations (i.e., edge weights) included: prioritized gambling over other areas; guilty when gambling; and asked someone for money due to gambling. These symptoms are related to disordered gambling and are expected to exert greater influence on the network of symptoms of addictive behaviors. In other words, these symptoms are connected more frequently and more strongly with other presentations of addictive behaviors and may be seen as risk factors for exacerbating the negative impact of current symptomatology, while increasing the probability of developing further problematic behaviors, either in the context of comorbidities or substi tution/replacement (Fried et al., 2017).
Indeed, centrality indices reflect the potential influence exerted on manifestations of addictive behaviors within and across other forms of addictive disorders (Hevey, 2018). However, focusing exclusively on symptoms associated with different forms of addiction enables the identification of bridge symptoms (Vanzhula et al., 2021). This is particularly useful to address influential symptoms (i.e., `super spreaders') that might increase the likelihood of developing crossaddictive behaviors and/or developing a new form of addiction while

disengaging from a previously established one. Symptoms of addictive behaviors with the highest bridge centrality
indices were predominantly associated with drug abuse (i.e., used drugs for other than medical reasons, had blackouts or flashbacks due to drug use, feel guilty about drug use, and abuse more than one drug at a time), and

disordered gambling (need to spend more and more money to get the desired high). This demonstrates that a variety of drug abuse related symptoms have the capacity to influence the development of comorbid addictions and/or seek alternative forms of addiction upon the extinction of the original addictive disorder (Haylett et al., 2004).

Fig. 6. Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) approach to detecting communities of problematic behaviors. As seen here, nine underlying communities of problematic behaviors present the optimum solution (with IGD and IDS overlapping as one dimension).

Counterintuitively, the least influential manifestations of addictive behaviors within the broader network may also convey valuable infor mation. Specifically, the least influential symptoms observed in the current study included the perceived ability to exert control on the substance or activity of addiction (i.e., able to stop using drugs; how soon after waking up you have a smoke; and frequency of alcohol intake). This may mean that reduced perceived control and agency of one's addictive behavior is more a peripheral, and less a core element of their disorder (West & Brown, 2013).
Finally, observing centrality indices at the disorder level (e.g., disordered gaming) facilitates identification of potentially influential forms of addiction. Findings indicated that drug abuse was the most influential form of addiction followed by alcohol abuse. Interestingly however, the third most influential problematic behavior was gaming disorder (i.e., IGD; APA, 2013) denoting the importance of prioritizing the assessment of additional comorbidities when one presents with these particular addictive behaviors (Stavropoulos et al., 2019). Previous research supports this notion providing evidence of co-occurring forms of addiction including drugs, alcohol, and tobacco (Lorains et al., 2011); internet gaming, drugs and alcohol (Lee et al., 2018; M큖relle et al., 2017); internet gaming and gambling (Delfabbro & King, 2020); and sex and gambling (Farr큖 et al., 2015). However, further investigation is warranted to replicate results reported in the present study.
4.3. Practical implications
Aside of the taxonomical implications highlighted above, our find ings have practical implications in relation to the assessment and intervention protocols related to addictive disorders (Burleigh et al., 2019; Demetrovics & Griffiths, 2012; Griffiths, 1996; Griffiths, 2005; Griffiths, 2017). Firstly, considering assessment, the present study highlights the need for less broadly accepted forms of addictive prob lematic behaviors such as exercise, shopping, internet use and social

media to be separately assessed in clinical practice (Andreassen et al., 2015; Rozgonjuk et al., 2021; Stavropoulos et al., 2013; Trot et al., 2020). It is important to note, that some of the addictive behaviors analyzed in the current study are yet to be formally recognized as such (i.e., social media abuse, compulsive shopping, disordered internet use, and hypersexual activity).
Nonetheless, findings presented in the current study support the notion that different forms of addiction encompass uniquely different disorders (Anderson et al., 2017; Demetrovics & Griffiths, 2012; Grif fiths, 1996; Kircaburun et al., 2020). Although all problematic behaviors may be assessed by an underlying common element (such as salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict, and relapse; Grif fiths, 2005), apparent differentiations pose the need for their indepen dent assessment. This notion aligns with the inclusion of distinct forms of behavioral addictions such as disordered gambling and internet gaming disorder in the DSM-5 (APA, 2013). Overall, a more careful assessment of behavioral addictions which my often receive less atten tion in mental health practice, such as disordered social media use or problematic sexual behavior, would enable clinicians to diagnose in dividuals accordingly (Anderson et al., 2017; Griffiths, 1996; Stavro poulos et al., 2013).
Secondly, from an intervention perspective, evidence presented here highlights the importance of separately treating distinct symptoms/ manifestations of addictive behaviors to avoid the development of comorbidities, as well as the transition from one form to another (Haylett et al., 2004). Specifically, our findings indicate that selected symptoms related to compulsive gambling, disordered drinking, and drug abuse (i.e., negative financial consequences, excessive preoccupa tion, guilt, and interpersonal strain due to the presence of the disordered behaviour) may pose a more significant risk for expanding one's addictive difficulties (Burleigh et al., 2019; Farr큖 et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2018; Lorains et al., 2011; Martin et al., 2013a; M큖relle et al., 2017). Moreover, findings reported here suggest that symptoms related to

9

D. Zarate et al.

Addictive Behaviors Reports 15 (2022) 100406

disordered drug use should be prioritized to minimize the likelihood of developing co-morbid forms of addiction (Nkansah-Amankra, 2020). Devising strategies to prioritize the treatment of these selected symp toms could also prove to be more effective in reducing the likelihood of replacing one form of addiction with another (Vanzhula et al., 2021).
5. Limitations, further research and conclusion
Results reported here need to be interpreted in the context of potentially significant limitations. Firstly, our sample is representative of adults living in developed countries and thus might not generalize to other individuals living in non-developed countries. Secondly, our sample is representative of non-clinically diagnosed individuals. Thus, further research might seek to reproduce these findings in individuals who have received a clinical diagnosis of addictive disorder(s). Thirdly, as our network structure showed only moderate stability and accuracy of edge weights, these results should be interpreted with some caution. Furthermore, network analysis assumes a formative approach to un derstanding addiction, thus relationships between symptoms and addictive disorders are perceived as causal systems (van Borkulo et al., 2015), however, as cross-sectional data has been employed here, cau sality cannot be assumed. Further research may wish to address this concern by employing longitudinal data collection, and thus enable analysis of directionality in edges between symptoms of addiction. Additionally, longitudinal datasets would enable the concurrent exam ination of both between and within individual differences, providing interesting clinical insights. Fourthly, considering the apparent differ ences in addictive behaviors across binary genders (i.e., males and fe males) and age groups, future work may wish to identify networks of addictive behaviors for these different groups. Fifthly, considering the potential association between problematic behaviors occurring exclu sively in online environments, further studies may wish to employ measures that capture hypersexual behavior exclusively in online en vironments. Finally, further research should also investigate age-specific populations at risk for the development and establishment of addictive behaviors, such as children and emerging adults, to identify specific links/networks of comorbidities in relation to other highly prevalent disorders within these age-ranges.
Despite these limitations, our findings shed new light on the conceptualization and intervention of addictions. Using network anal ysis to a large population-based sample of adults, we provided important evidence justifying the need to further recognize unique forms of addiction. Additionally, we have provided evidence demonstrating the importance of addressing symptoms/manifestations of addictive be haviors related to drug abuse, disordered gambling, and disordered alcohol use as symptoms related to these addictive disorders may in crease the likelihood of symptom severity, the development of comorbid addictions and/or the risk of substituting one form of addiction with another.

abstract
Long-term follow-up data from multicenter phase III non-inferiority trials confirmed the safety of omission of axillary dissection in selected patients with clinically node-negative, sentinel node-positive breast cancer. Several ongoing trials investigate extended eligibility of the Z0011 protocol in the adjuvant setting. De-escalation of axillary surgery in patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer is currently limited to the neoadjuvant setting, where the sentinel procedure is used to determine nodal pathological complete response. Targeted axillary dissection lowers the false-negative rate of the sentinel procedure, which, however, is consistently associated with a very low risk of axillary recurrence in several recent single-center series. Axillary dissection remains standard care in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy while the results of Alliance A011202 are pending. The TAXIS trial investigates the role of tailored axillary surgery in patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer, a novel concept designed to selectively remove positive nodes in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting.  2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1. Summary
The evolution of axillary surgery is characterized by surgical deescalation. Radical axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed as standard in patients with breast cancer for almost a century. Since the identification of the sentinel nodes in the 90s, ALND was performed for clinically node-positive breast cancer and whenever cancer was found in the sentinel nodes. Today, we have learned from clinical trials that we can omit ALND in many patients with positive sentinel nodes [1,2]. In a situation with positive sentinel nodes and a high risk of recurrence, axillary radiation is increasingly preferred over ALND [3,4]. In the future, we will have to answer the question if we can omit the sentinel procedure in patients with negative ultrasound [5e8]. We will also have to answer the question if we can omit ALND in all patients with positive sentinel nodes, even if there are additional risk factors [9e11]. Finally, we will have to find ways to omit ALND in clinically node-positive breast cancer with residual disease after neoadjuvant

chemotherapy (NACT) (NCT01901094) and in the upfront surgery setting [12]. Current concepts use limited axillary surgery procedures, such as the sentinel procedure, to determine if the nodes are clear after NACT without removing them all [13,14].
2. Current indications for axillary dissection
Long-term follow-up data of several large phase III noninferiority trials, randomizing clinically node-negative patients with positive sentinel nodes into one group with axillary dissection, compared to no axilla-specific treatment, have been published. Both the ACOSOG Z0011 and the IBCSG 23e01 trials found extremely low rates (<2%) of axillary recurrence, showing that many of these patients do not need axilla-specific treatment [1,2]. ALND is still considered standard practice in clinically nodepositive breast cancer in the upfront surgery setting, in patients with residual nodal disease after NACT and in locally advanced breast cancer (cT3-4, inflammatory breast cancer, >2 positive sentinel nodes, gross extranodal disease). ALND is also indicated in sentinel node-positive patients with macrometastases undergoing mastectomy, but only if the positive sentinel node per se does not indicate postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) or if irradiation does

not include the lymph nodes (Table 1). If PMRT is performed and includes the axilla, sentinel node-positive patients do not require ALND, as radiation will suffice [3]. This has been demonstrated by the EORTC AMAROS trial, where the promising 10-year follow-up data were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium 2018, while full publication is pending [15]. In this trial, clinically node-negative, sentinel node-positive patients (n  1425, of whom 17% underwent mastectomy) were randomized into a control group with ALND compared to axillary irradiation as experimental treatment. At a median follow-up of 10 years, axillary recurrence occurred in 0.9% in the ALND group vs. 1.8% in the irradiation group. Even though non-inferiority could not be proven statistically, from a clinical point of view looking at the very low rates of axillary recurrence, clinical non-inferiority was demonstrated. Therefore, in cases where treatment of the axilla is planned for patients within this population, irradiation can be an alternative to ALND. Patient selection for axillary radiation versus observation in this situation is a field of ongoing controversy.
3. Can Z0011 eligibility be broadened?
Because of the limitations of the ACOSOG Z0011 study, a series of randomized trials were initiated to validate the findings of Z0011 after the first results were published. In the meantime, however, the protocol has been validated by prospective observational studies and practice has been changed accordingly in many countries [16,17]. Therefore, the randomized trials adjusted their focus to patients that were excluded from Z0011. In the ERC/IPC 2012-001 SERC trial from France, they included 1855 patients at 53 sites according to Z0011 from 2012 to 2018 and started to select Z0011 non-eligible patients in August 2018 [9]. In the SENOMAC trial from Sweden, several countries started to focus on patients undergoing mastectomy [10]. All of these axillary surgery de-escalation studies encountered methodological challenges, primarily due to a lack of power based on lower than expected rates of events or accrual [1e3,9,10,15].

and in the event of residual nodal disease after NACT. The use of non-invasive imaging after NACT cannot replace axillary surgery. In a meta-analysis looking at how reliable imaging is in determining nodal pathological complete response (pCR), the outcome of 2380 patients in 13 studies with non-invasive imaging after NACT was compared with axillary surgery [19]. The study showed an axillary pCR of 39.5% (941/2380). Sensitivity for ultrasound, MRI, or PET-CT was far away from being reliable in terms of assessing accurate axillary response after NACT (65%, 60%, resp. 38%). At this point, microscopic analysis of at least a few nodes after NACT is needed to determine pCR in the lymph nodes, which de-escalated axillary surgery in current practice. A meta-analysis of 20 studies including 2217 patients investigated the false-negative rate (FNR) of the sentinel node procedure in biopsy-proven clinically node-positive patients with clinically node-negative sentinel lymph nodes after NACT undergoing back-up ALND [13]. The FNR was 22%; however, the FNR decreased to 8% when at least three negative nodes were removed and double tracing was used. The MARI procedure selectively marked and removed the sampled node with a radioactive seed, which showed a FNR of 7%. With the combination of the two techniques, selective localization and removal of the clipped node together with the sentinel procedure, the lowest FNR of 2e4% can be achieved [13]. This combination is called targeted axillary dissection (TAD). The prospective SenTa registry study included 473 patients with clipped nodes at 50 German centers. It showed that the clipped lymph node and sentinel node were identical in 64.8% and the detection rate of the clipped lymph node after NACT was 86.9% [14]. This means that the clip was left behind in 13% of patients, which can become problematic from a medical-legal aspect in case of regional recurrence. However, in terms of the FNR, performance was well with a FNR of 7.2% for the removal of just the localized node and a FNR of 4.3% when TAD was performed (Table 2).

4. Clinically node-positive breast cancer
Clinically node-positive patients are commonly defined by the occurrence of palpable disease at the time of diagnosis. Nonpalpable disease detected solely on imaging can be considered clinically node-positive or imaging node-positive and refers to a frequent subpopulation in clinical practice where preoperative ultrasound or MRI is routinely used. Both groups are often jointly categorized as biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer, as pathologic confirmation of malignancy is recommended [18]. Most of these patients still undergo ALND in the upfront surgery setting

is the most commonly performed procedure today. For a long time, the importance of the FNR was unclear, since leaving chemoresistant cancer in the nodes may increase axillary recurrence compared to the adjuvant setting. A retrospective single-center study from Canada investigated 102 patients in this setting [20]. Of these, 71% had regional irradiation and a medium of 4 negative sentinel nodes were removed. There was not a single case of axillary recurrence at a median follow-up of three years. However, since the authors insisted on having several negative nodes, the expected FNR was low and in combination with the broad use of axillary irradiation, these results were expected. On the other hand, a series from Milan also reported only two axillary recurrences at a very long median follow up of 9.2 years in 123 patients [21]. Importantly, they used only single tracer (99Tc), resulting in 74% of patients with less than 3 negative sentinel nodes, and the majority of patients did not get regional irradiation. Hence, the expected FNR was much higher, and yet, the vast majority of patients did not show recurrence. Similar results were confirmed in two retrospective studies from Brazil and the Mayo Clinic with removal of a median of 2 and 3 negative sentinel nodes, respectively, and very low rate of recurrence [22,23]. These results confirmed that the sentinel procedure is a valid treatment option in these patients (Table 3).
5. Ongoing clinical trials in clinically node-positive breast cancer
ALND is the standard procedure when residual disease after NACT is detected in the sentinel nodes. The ongoing Alliance A011202 trial is randomizing this patient population into ALND

compared to axillary radiation in the context of extended regional nodal irradiation (NCT01901094). Accrual is almost completed and the primary endpoint analysis is expected in a few years. Until then, the omission of ALND should be considered experimental in most of these patients. An analysis from the National Cancer Database looked at patients with up to 3 lymph nodes with residual disease and compared the sentinel procedure (defined as removal of 4 lymph nodes) with radiation (n  304) versus ALND with radiation (n  1313) [24]. Patients without ALND showed worse overall survival (71% vs. 77% at 5 years). Even though there is always selection bias in such studies-patients with more co-morbidities were spared ALND and the difference in outcome was due to the comorbidity and not the omission of the ALND-these results call for caution and confirmation by randomized trials. Interestingly, however, the authors found subgroups, primarily luminal tumors with only one lymph node metastasis, where the omission of ALND did not decrease survival.
The European phase III randomized controlled TAXIS trial investigates the role of a novel concept called tailored axillary surgery (TAS) in patients with clinically node positive breast cancer in the neoadjuvant and the upfront surgery setting (NCT03513614). Accrual is running as estimated, with over 400 patients already randomized of the total planned sample size of 1500 (Fig. 1). TAS removes all palpably clearly suspicious lymph nodes together with the sentinel lymph nodes, whereas imaging-guided localization of the clipped node is optional. Main purpose of TAS is to reduce the tumor load in the axilla to the point where axillary irradiation can control it. Therefore, in a randomized manner, TAS with axillary irradiation is compared to standard ALND in the context of extended regional nodal irradiation. This non-inferiority trial

investigates disease-free survival as primary endpoint and quality of life as most important secondary endpoint. Completion of accrual is expected in 2024 and analysis of the primary endpoint to be published in 2030.

 Acute hemodynamic decompensation may occur during ablation of ventricular tachycardia irrespective of the mapping/ablation strategy.

mias and may be associated with acute hemodynamic decompensation (AHD). Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) during VTA has increased, and observational studies using the PAINESD score suggest a mortality benefit.2 The PAINESD score estimates the risk of AHD during VTA. Among patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and a PAINESD score $15, MCS during VTA decreased 30-day rehospitalization, repeat ablation, recurrent implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) therapy, and 3-month mortality.3 Moreover, prophylactic implementation of MCS in high-risk patients is associated with a 3.5-fold reduction in mortality or need for heart transplantation.4,5
Although evidence supports MCS during high-risk VTA (HR-VTA), pathways for case selection, preprocedural assessment, and multidisciplinary coordination have not been elucidated. Currently, there are no established weaning protocols to guide postprocedure care. We present a multidisciplinary approach for HR-VTA requiring MCS, including recommendations for weaning.

vation and entrainment mapping strategy rather than

a substrate-based approach given the recurrence of VT within 6 months of ablation. Pre-emptive MCS with a percutaneous ventricular assist device (pVAD) was planned because the patient was deemed high risk (PAINESD score of 17).
ANESTHESIA. Before induction, American Society of Anesthesiologists monitors were placed, cerebral oximetry was initiated, and the radial artery was cannulated. General anesthesia was induced with etomidate and succinylcholine, followed by endotracheal intubation. A pulmonary artery catheter was placed via the right internal jugular vein. Norepinephrine and epinephrine infusions were titrated to maintain blood pressure within 20% of baseline, cerebral saturation >60% and within 20% of baseline, as well as cardiac index >2 L/min/m2, mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO2) >60%, cardiac power output (CPO) >0.6 W, and serum lactate <2 mmol/L.
PERCUTANEOUS VENTRICULAR SUPPORT. The right common femoral artery was accessed under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance, and angiography confirmed position before placement of a 6-F sheath. A pigtail catheter was positioned at the abdominal aortic bifurcation, and an angiogram was performed to evaluate for significant peripheral artery disease. Heparin was administered to maintain activated clotting time >300 seconds. The arteriotomy site was progressively dilated before placing a 14-F peel-away sheath. The pigtail catheter was advanced into the

left ventricle, and a pVAD was placed with resultant 3.8 L/min flow.
ABLATION. Right femoral vein access was obtained under ultrasound guidance. A long, fixed curve sheath was used to perform a transseptal puncture and was exchanged for a large curl deflectable sheath. An irrigated force-sensing ablation catheter was advanced through the sheath into the left ventricle. A detailed bipolar voltage map of the left ventricle showed a large anterior wall scar corresponding to the location of the aneurysm (Figure 1). VT was induced and mapped using a multielectrode splined mapping catheter; the activation map identified a critical isthmus-based activation pattern and presence of mid-diastolic potentials. Ablation was performed, and the clinical VT was no longer inducible after targeted ablation. Additional ablation was performed around and within the scar with a core isolation approach. Pacing at high output confirmed the scar was electrically unexcitable postablation.
Induction was attempted after scar homogenization, and a second, morphologically distinct VT was induced. An activation map of the left ventricle was created, but the full cycle length of the tachycardia was not captured in the LV endocardium, suggesting an epicardial component of the circuit (Figure 2). Additional ablation was performed at the exit site based on findings of the activation map. After extensive endocardial ablation, a sustained nonclinical VT with an epicardial component remained inducible, but the initial clinical VT remained noninducible.

WEANING MCS AND POSTPROCEDURE CARE. Postablation, the CPO was 0.9 W, consistent with baseline, and was maintained as the pVAD was weaned from "Auto" to P2 over 40 minutes. On P2, the arterial pulsatility was preserved and mean arterial pressure
was 70 mm Hg on norepinephrine 3 mg/kg/min, SVO2
was >60%, and serum lactate was 1.4 mmol/L. The pVAD was removed, and hemostasis was obtained with suture-based closure devices. The patient was extubated, and his care was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit where norepinephrine was weaned, and his home heart failure medication regimen was restarted. He was discharged home 2 days' postablation. At 1-year follow-up, he remains free of sustained VT and has not required ICD therapy.
QUESTION 1: WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF MCS DURING HR-VTA?
MCS improves hemodynamics and continuously unloads the left ventricle; we believe this action translates into improved end-organ perfusion during HR-VTA. Indeed, cerebral desaturation has been observed during fast VT (tachycardia cycle length <300 milliseconds), but with MCS, the incidence of cerebral desaturation decreases significantly.6 Prophylactic MCS is superior to a rescue strategy, and 30-day mortality is higher with rescue compared with pre-emptive pVAD implantation in high-risk patients experiencing AHD during VTA.7 Even with successful rescue and improved hemodynamics, 40.2% of patients with AHD during VTA died within 30 days.8 Furthermore, pre-emptive MCS may

reduce inotropic and vasopressor usage and avoid the associated myocardial oxygen demand and impairment in tissue perfusion. This underscores the importance of preprocedure risk stratification and pre-emptive MCS. Pre-emptive MCS should be considered irrespective of VTA strategy, as activation and entrainment techniques as well as substrate mapping may precipitate AHD. We prefer pVAD because of the ease of placement and its ability to

unload the left ventricle. The PAINESD score has been validated as an effective way to risk stratify patients; our use of objective perfusion measures provides additional guidance when MCS may be warranted and can guide weaning.
QUESTION 2: WHAT IS THE APPROACH TO MULTIDISCIPLINARY CARE?
Multidisciplinary care in a dedicated VT unit favorably affects VT recurrence and hospitalization.9 However, multidisciplinary management of HR-VTA is not well established. Ideally, HR-VTA includes interdisciplinary expertise from interventional cardiology, a heart failure specialist, cardiac anesthesiologist, and occasionally, a cardiac/vascular surgeon, in addition to the treating electrophysiologist (Table 1). MCS implantation and explantation should be performed by an experienced interventional cardiologist who is proficient with large-bore vascular access and adheres to best practices (Table 2). The interventionalist and electrophysiologist coordinate the timing of MCS insertion as well as need for epicardial access. The cardiac anesthesiologist has a critical role in preprocedure planning and periprocedural hemodynamic management. The anesthesiologist is tasked with maintaining endorgan perfusion even in the presence of recurrent VT and AHD (Figure 3). The heart failure cardiologist assists with optimizing volume status before the procedure, and, at our center, heart failure medications are typically held to reduce periprocedural hypotension. They also assist with weaning MCS, provide postprocedure care, and are instrumental in

FIGURE 4 Weaning MCS

Prolonged tachycardia and hypotension may provoke myocardial ischemia and stunning, increasing reliance on mechanical circulatory support (MCS). We recommend assessment of cardiac power output (CPO), pulsatility of the arterial waveform, mixed venous oxygenation saturation (SVO2), and lactate before decreasing device flows. We suggest reassessing weaning criteria after each reduction and before withdrawing MCS.

Maintenance of end-organ perfusion even during induction of ventricular tachycardia is paramount. We aim to maintain cardiac index >2 L/min/m2, mixed venous oxygenation >60%, cardiac power output >0.6 W, and lactate <2 mmol/L, as well as blood pressure and cerebral oximetry 60% to 90% and within 20% of baseline.
assessing candidacy for advanced heart failure therapies. When epicardial access is planned, cardiothoracic surgery is also involved with multidisciplinary care.

QUESTION 3: WHAT PARAMETERS GUIDE WEANING OF MCS?
During HR-VTA, we monitor CPO and objective measures of end-organ perfusion (Figure 3) as perfusion delineates the efficacy of MCS and defines our weaning criteria (Figure 4). Weaning begins with assessment of CPO, as this is an important marker of end-organ perfusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock.10 A CPO >0.6 W

suggests adequate intrinsic cardiac function. Next, the arterial waveform is evaluated; loss of pulsatility indicates dependence on MCS (Figure 5). Pulsatility should be preserved without significant vasopressor or inotropic support. A SVO2 >60% and lactate levels <2 mmol/L also suggest that tissue perfusion is adequate. We suggest decreasing device flows and reassessing weaning criteria before withdrawing MCS. Delayed weaning should be considered when baseline LV ejection fraction is <20% and/or CPO is <0.6 W. In our experience, objective assessment of perfusion helps avoid AHD during HR-VTA even without MCS, as these parameters guide vasoactive support and suggest when ventricular arrhythmias should be terminated and/or mapping discontinued.
CONCLUSIONS
We present an approach to HR-VTA with MCS and highlight the importance of multidisciplinary coordi-

nation and objective hemodynamic assessment. This potentially paradigm-shifting approach to HR-VTA with MCS should be interrogated systematically to evaluate clinical outcomes.

1. Definitions of dominant diseases of traditional Chinese medicine
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long history of preventing and treating diseases and it has made a great contribution to the life and health of the people, both in China and elsewhere. In 2001, a new concept -- dominant disease of TCM was proposed to identify the diseases that can be effectively treated using TCM.1 There are mainly two proposed definitions for dominant diseases of TCM. One is represented by the diseases with the largest number of inpatients in hospitals specializing in TCM.2 The other refers to diseases that are better treatable by TCM than Western medicine.3,4 In recent years, screening and identification of dominant diseases of TCM has become highly valued by the State Administration of TCM.5 However, the identification methods for dominant diseases are heterogeneous.
2. Methods used for dominant diseases of TCM
2.1. Bibliometric analysis
Bibliometrics has been actively applied in the screening of dominant diseases of TCM, especially related to acupuncture and moxibustion. Diseases identified through bibliometric method reflect

(Y. Chen). 1 The authors contributed equally to this work as co-first authors.

the popularity and recognition of effectiveness of TCM in different fields of medicine, and this method can thus provide a good basis for the definition and research of dominant diseases.6,7 The dominant diseases identified by this method are usually from the fields of gastroenterology, gynecology, neurology, orthopedics, and respiratory medicine. However, the current clinical literature on TCM has some limitations, such as the lack of scientific methodology and research design, and small sample size, which greatly reduce the credibility of the literature. These limitations will inevitably affect the accuracy and unambiguousness of the identification of dominant diseases.
2.2. Clinical cases analysis
The studies using clinical cases analysis on different indicators include prescription frequency of TCM therapies, numbers of cases, and number of discharges from hospital. Respiratory diseases are the most common type of diseases investigated in the studies using this method. The identification of dominant diseases defined by clinical case analysis is based on a retrospective summary of case data from medical institutions, and the dominant diseases can thus be directly identified by ranking the number of cases of inpatient diseases. The data source of this method is reliable and objective, the sample size is large, the screening process is comparatively brief and feasible, and the statistical results can be easily presented visually. However, this approach is also susceptible to a number of practical factors, including hospitals' support policies for the development of novel technologies for TCM, expansion of the hospitals, and construction and development of key disciplines and key specialties with TCM characteristics, etc.

2.3. Expert investigation
Studies using expert investigation define dominant diseases on the frequency of being mentioned by the respondents. The dominant diseases are diverse across several fields of medicine: internal medicine, surgery, gynecology and pediatrics. Most experts in TCM and integrative medicine determine the dominant diseases of TCM through their own clinical experience. Expert investigation method can be seen as a form of peer review or expert consensus. This method, in which competent experts provide their professional experience and judgment, ensures that the findings are widely recognized and have a high reliability.8 However, the survey sample size in some expert investigations is relatively small. The number of experts conducting the survey affects the accuracy of the results. Therefore, it is necessary to apply strict criteria for the selection of experts to assure a broad representativeness across geographical regions, professions, level of experience, gender, and other relevant factors.
2.4. Administrative investigation
Few studies use administrative investigation to identify dominant diseases. Administrative investigations conducted in China usually involve national or local healthcare authorities and their TCM departments, and TCM related professional societies, associations and organizations. The inclusion of such authoritative bodies can further ensure the comprehensiveness of the survey. The reliability of the data is higher and the execution of the survey is more efficient than in expert investigations.9 However, the administrative investigation method also has certain limitations. Since the survey targets are medical institutions, they often tend to develop some specialties with larger service markets into key specialties and dominant diseases to seek their development. While some of the dominant diseases with smaller service volume are easily marginalized or even ignored by medical institutions. 10
2.5. Other
Other methods include clinical trials and meta-analyses. Conditions covered by these studies include diseases in the fields of dermatology, neurology and otorhinolaryngology.
3. Commentary
There is currently no standardized method for determining the dominant diseases of TCM. The amount of literature on dominant disease identification is increasing, with bibliometrics, clinical cases analysis and expert investigation being the most commonly used methods. The characteristics and distribution of dominant diseases largely reflect the distribution of the medical service resources.10 Although the number of identified dominant diseases is high, they are focused on a few specific fields, such as digestive, neurological and respiratory diseases. This reflects well the profile of diseases most commonly treated with TCM and integrative medicine. The reasons may be due to the dominant disciplines of TCM, the construction of the medicine disciplines and specialties of medicine, and the role of the authorities and supporting policies for TCM by the hospitals.11,12 In the future, the research on the dominant diseases of TCM needs to be expanded. The research should particularly focus on the advantages of TCM, with the aim to (1) encourage the diversified collaboration between the researchers and clinicians focusing on different dominant diseases,

Integrative Medicine Research 11 (2022) 100872
(2) further optimize the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases, (3) refine the treatment plans, and (4) constantly improve the level of service of TCM and integrative medicine.

Prognostic factors for conversion to generalization in ocular myasthenia gravis
Juthamat Witthayaweerasak, MD , Narisa Rattanalert, MD, Nipat Aui-aree, MD

Abstract Patients with ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) are frequently treated to prevent the development of generalized myasthenia gravis (GMG). This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess prognostic factors associated with conversion to GMG.
We analyzed the time from the onset of OMG symptoms to GMG in relation to demographic variables, clinical findings, initial investigation results, and treatment regimens using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate Cox proportional regression analysis.
Of 115 patients diagnosed with OMG (median follow-up time, 2.9 years), 28 (30.4%) developed GMG. The 2-year probability of GMG conversion was 23.7%. Patients with thymic abnormalities and a positive response to repetitive facial nerve stimulation had a significantly higher risk than those with negative results (hazard ratios [HR] 4.28, P < .001 and HR 3.84, P = .04, respectively). Treatment with immunosuppressants was found to be a preventive factor for secondary generalization (HR 0.36, P = .02).
Patients with OMG had a low risk of developing GMG. Immunosuppressive treatments may mitigate disease progression. Chest imaging and repetitive nerve stimulation should be routinely performed to assess the risk of generalization.

1. Introduction
Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune postsynaptic neuromuscular transmission disorder that manifests as fatigable weakness.[1,2] Up to 85% of patients with myasthenia gravis have ocular symptoms as an initial manifestation, and ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) is diagnosed when a patient presents with ptosis or diplopia resulting from weakness of the orbicularis oculi or extraocular muscles.[3,4] When the symptoms involve

other muscle groups, it is called generalized myasthenia gravis
(GMG).
Patients with OMG are frequently treated with acetylcholin-
esterase inhibitor (AChEI) and immunosuppressants (IMS) such
as corticosteroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclosporin.[1,5,6] Several studies have reported that both AChEI and IMS treatment resulted in similar significant symptomatic improvement in 40% to 85% of patients.[5-7] Other studies have
found that the rate of conversion to GMG was lower in patients
treated with IMS than in untreated patients, with 34% to 86% of
untreated patients having secondary generalization within 2 years
of onset, whereas only 6% to 17% of patients treated with IMS progressed to GMG.[2,8-11]
Previous reports have identified various prognostic factors associated with GMG including age at onset <50 years, smoking, thymus abnormalities, positive repetitive nerve stimulation
(RNS), and positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR Ab).[10,12-19] Another recent report found the overall conversion rate was as low as 11%.[18] The average conversion rate among
people living in certain Asian countries has been reported to be 23.6%,[13,18,19] which is lower than the mean conversion rate reported in people of European ethnicity (49.2%).[14-17,20,21]
These varying results have led to some controversy concerning
the conversion rate in relation to prognosis and regarding the risks and benefits of early IMS treatment to prevent generalization in patients with OMG.
This study aimed to examine the possible prognostic factors influencing the conversion rate of OMG to GMG and determine appropriate treatment regimens to reduce conversion to generalization. The findings of this study may provide an effective treatment to improve the quality of life in patients with ocular myasthenia.

2. Methods
Between January 2006 and April 2018, we conducted a retrospective cohort study, in which at least 2 neuro-ophthalmologists or neurologists at the Eye Clinic or Neurology Center in Songklanagarind Hospital, the primary tertiary care center in southern Thailand, reviewed the electronic medical records of patients diagnosed with OMG. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand. The Ethics Committee waived the requirement for written patient informed consent as this research posed less than minimal risk to patients and because the rights and welfare of the patients would not be adversely affected by this study. All patients manifested isolated ocular symptoms such as ptosis or diplopia, at the initial presentation <2 years prior to a diagnosis of OMG and had a confirmed final diagnosis of OMG based on one of the following tests:
1. a pharmacological test (pyridostigmine or neostigmine), 2. RNS, 3. a serum AChR Ab test, where available, and 4. an ice pack test or fatigue-induced ptosis test with a clinical
response to treatment.
An ice pack test was deemed positive if there was >2 mm of improved ptosis or 50% reduction in the ocular deviation with a Hess screen test after an ice pack was applied on both eyelids for 2 minutes and 5 minutes, respectively. A response to a fatigueinduced ptosis test was considered positive when a patient experienced fatigable ptosis after a sustained upgaze for 1 minute. All patients with OMG were monitored until conversion to GMG or to the last follow-up visit. We excluded patients diagnosed with congenital, infantile, or juvenile OMG. We also excluded patients who presented with systemic symptoms within 1 month of the time of diagnosis. Patients with other active eye diseases potentially mimicking OMG, such as thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy, and patients with any previous eyelid or strabismic surgeries were excluded.
We assessed the conversion rate to GMG during the follow-up visits. Patients who developed symptoms or clinical findings including axial or limb weakness, facial weakness (except in the ocular muscles), or bulbar symptoms (difficulty breathing,

swallowing, hoarseness) were defined as secondary generalizations and were diagnosed by a neurologist. Clinical examination included ocular symptoms, duration of symptoms, and eye movement assessment. Chest imaging or contrast computed tomography for detecting the anterior mediastinal lesion, antinuclear factor (ANA), a thyroid function test, electromyography studies (RNS), and tests to assess the presence of autoimmune diseases, were also undertaken. Thymus abnormalities were assessed through a positive radiological or pathological confirmation after thymectomy. RNS test was performed by an electromyographer, and muscle testing including facial and limb muscles were selected based on clinical weakness. A positive repetitive facial nerve stimulation test result was defined as >10% of a decremental response in the nasalis or orbicularis oculi muscle, which has the advantage of a diagnostic yield of OMG.[22,23] A positive ANA was deemed as an ANA titer of 1:80 or more, detected using immunofluorescence assay. Abnormal thyroid function was diagnosed as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. After a positive diagnosis of OMG, patient treatments were categorized into 2 groups, namely, IMS (corticosteroid, azathioprine, or other IMS) and non-IMS (AChEI or no medications) groups. Additionally, we recorded the time from symptom onset to the date of diagnosis, initial treatment, GMG conversion, or the last follow-up visit.
For statistical analysis, comparisons of clinical characteristics between the IMS and non-IMS treatment groups were undertaken using chi-square or Fisher exact tests for categorical variables and a Student t test for numeric data. The time from onset of OMG symptoms to GMG was analyzed in relation to demographic variables, clinical manifestations, investigation results, and treatment regimens using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Variables with a P value <.2 from a log rank test were then included in a multivariate Cox proportional regression analysis. All data analyses were performed using R (R Core Team 2019).
3. Results
In total, we reviewed 115 patients who had been diagnosed with OMG (median follow-up time, 2.9 years; interquartile range [IQR], 1.5-5.5 years). Patients' clinical characteristics are

summarized in Table 1. More than two-thirds of the participants were female, and most were middle-aged (47.5  14.2 years). Almost 50% presented with both ptosis and diplopia and had limited eye movement with a median duration of symptoms of 2.1 months (IQR, 1-6.1 months). All patients had their diagnosis confirmed based on clinical manifestations and on the results of one of the following tests: a clinical response to a neostigmine test (18 tested patients) and a response to pyridostigmine (88 patients), positive repetitive facial nerve stimulation test result (20 of 32 tested patients), seropositive anti-AChR (6 of 8 tested patients), a positive ice pack test (85 of 93 tested patients), and a fatigue-induced ptosis test (107 of 109 tested patients). After diagnosis, 96 (83.5%) patients underwent chest imaging, and anterior mediastinal lesions were detected in 17 patients by performing contrast computed tomography, of whom 11 patients underwent thymectomy with pathological confirmation of thymus abnormalities, including thymoma (n = 6), thymic hyperplasia (n = 4), and malignant thymoma (n = 1). During the follow-up visits, 6 patients with unremarkable chest imaging underwent thymectomy, and all of these pathologies involved thymic hyperplasia. Seropositive ANA was found in 9 of 48 (18.8%) patients, and 12 of 84 (14.3%) patients had abnormal thyroid function without thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy. Hyperthyroidism or rheumatoid arthritis, which are both autoimmune diseases, were identified in 8 and 1 patient, respectively.
Patients were initially treated based on clinical manifestations and were categorized according to treatment regimen prior to the onset of GMG, as shown in Table 1. The median time from onset to starting treatment was 2.1 (range, 1-6.1) months and there was no significant difference in the time to receiving treatment between the groups. Pyridostigmine was administered to all patients in the no-IMS group (n = 34, 29.6%). Of 81 (70.4%) patients in the IMS group, 65 patients received various doses of corticosteroid (prednisolone, 5-70 mg per day), 4 patients received azathioprine alone (25-100 mg per day), and 12 patients received a combination of prednisolone and azathioprine. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics or investigations between the treatment groups, except for ocular symptoms (Table 1). The incidence of both ptosis and diplopia was higher in the IMS treatment group, since the poor response to anticholinesterase was the basis for commencing immunosuppressants. After the diagnosis of GMG, 2 patients received intravenous immunoglobulin due to the rapid exacerbation of their symptoms. During the follow-up period, both patients with OMG and those with GMG who had been treated with IMS had various side-effects, such as the development of a cushingoid appearance (n = 18), leukopenia or pancytopenia (n = 5), opportunistic infection (n = 4), gastrointestinal disturbance (n = 4), ocular hypertension (n = 3), cataract (n = 3), rash (n = 2), and uncontrolled blood sugar (n = 1).
3.1. Risk of secondary generalized myasthenia gravis
Overall, 35 (30.4%) patients developed GMG during the followup. Figure 1-A summarizes the time-to-event data using the Kaplan-Meier method. The 2-year, 4-year, and 6-year cumulative probabilities of progressing to GMG were 23.7%, 32.6%, and 34.9%, respectively. The median time to GMG conversion was 2.9 (range, 1.4-5.5) years. At 2-year follow-up visit, 13 (11.3%) patients were lost to follow-up, leaving 67 patients in the OMG group, and only 28 patients underwent the 6-year follow-

up visit. In Figure 1B, the time-to-event was classified according to treatment regimen and showed significantly different GMG progression between the regimens (P = .005). The conversion rates at 2-year and 4-year follow-ups in patients with IMS were 16.9% and 25.3%, respectively, both of which were lower than those in patients without IMS (40.8% and 51.9%, respectively). The median time to developing GMG in the IMS treatment group (3.1 years) was longer than that in the non-IMS group (1.7 years). In Figure 1C and D, significantly different time-to-GMG progressions in relation to thymus status and RNS results were observed (P < .001).
Table 2 summarizes the results of the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, which highlighted 3 statistically significant risk factors for developing GMG. Treatment with IMS significantly reduced the rate of GMG progression, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 0.36 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15-0.84). Patients with thymic abnormalities had a higher conversion rate than those with normal thymus (aHR 4.28, 95% CI 1.91-9.61), and patients with a positive response to the repetitive nerve stimulation test were more likely to progress to GMG than those with negative results (aHR 3.84, 95% CI 0.83- 17.75). Age group, signs and symptoms, ANA, and thyroid function test results were not significant predictors of GMG conversion.
4. Discussion
Our study reports the conversion rate and predictors for developing GMG in long-term follow-up patients with OMG in southern Thailand. In this study, patients treated with IMS had a longer GMG-free period than those not treated with IMS. This is an important finding in understanding the prognosis of OMG, which requires long-term follow-up to determine disease progression.
Regarding the demographic data, the mean age at OMG diagnosis in our study was 47.5 years old with a slightly higher prevalence of younger patients (50 years), which is similar to the age reported in a large retrospective study in Korea.[13] A slight female predominance in our study has also been reported by other studies in Asia,[13,19] in contrast to that of a populationbased study with a higher male prevalence.[24] The rate of secondary generalization at 2 years after onset in our study was 23.7%, which was similar to those of recent studies conducted in other Asian countries.[13,18,19] However, our results were lower than those reported in certain Western countries, where conversion rates have been found to be in the range of 50%.[14-17,20,21] We consider that the conversion rates varied among these studies because of the lack of a definitive diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, variations in demographic data, and the current widely used immunosuppressive therapy for preventing generalization. In terms of OMG diagnostic criteria, there is no single uniform test for disease confirmation. A positive serologic test was reported in 50% to 70% of patients with OMG[25,26] and the RNS test results indicated a decremental response in only 19% to 33% of patients.[27,28] We also included patients with a positive ice-pack test or a positive fatigue-induced ptosis test, and these tests have previously been reported to have a high sensitivity (>80%).[29-31] Therefore, using different diagnostic tests in several studies could have caused variations in the conversion rates. Currently, single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG) is the most sensitive test to diagnose OMG.[27,28,32] This technique requires a special needle electrode, and our hospital lacks the

single fiber recording capability. We recommend performing the SFEMG for the establishing OMG diagnosis in further studies. In addition, sex proportions and age may affect the rate of generalization. Our study had a predominance of female and younger patients (50 years), and several studies have reported that these patients have a high risk of progression to GMG.[15,16,19] However, the prevalence of treatment with IMS in our study (70.4%) was higher than that in various recent studies (32.7%-63.2%).[7,11,13,15,17-20,33] IMS treatment could have reduced the risk of developing generalization, based on the findings of previous studies.[13,17]
The risk factors for developing GMG in our study were thymus abnormalities detected through chest imaging or pathology and positive repetitive facial nerve stimulation test results. Previous studied have reported thymoma, thymic hyperplasia, and seropositive AChR Ab to be strong predictors of generalization.[10,13-19,21] In our study, the incidence of thymus abnormalities in OMG was found to be as low as 24%, which is similar to those of previous reports.[13,18,19] Because of the low incidence of seropositive AChR Ab and the lack of testing capability in our hospital, we decided not to assess this potential risk factor, but we recommend including serology for predictor analysis in future research. We also found that a positive RNS result was associated with generalization, which was in accordance with previous reports.[13,18,34] A possible explanation for this finding is that an abnormal RNS response at the limb muscles could help ophthalmologists diagnose subclinical types of GMG. In our study, we performed repetitive facial nerve stimulation testing at the nasalis or orbicularis oculi muscle, which would be positive for ocular myasthenia only and reduce bias in terms of limb muscle involvement.
A randomized controlled study evaluating the efficacy of corticosteroids found that patients treated with a placebo had a significantly higher incidence of treatment failure than those treated with prednisolone. However, the sample size was small, and the results of GMG conversion were inconclusive due to the short follow-up period (16 weeks).[35] Moreover, previous retrospective studies have reported inconsistent findings concerning the benefit of receiving IMS for the prevention of GMG.[13,17,18,20] Two studies found significantly lower rates of GMG in patients using a corticosteroid,[13,17] whereas 2 other studies found no significant difference in conversion rates between treatment groups.[18,20] Our study results indicated that treatment with IMS might reduce the rate of progression and delay the onset of GMG events. Based on previous reports, 80% to 90% of patients with OMG without immunosuppressive treatment developed secondary generalization within 2 years after onset without the likelihood of further progression.[3,4,10] Our report found the median time of generalization in IMS treatment was 3.1 years compared with 1.7 years in the non-IMS group. We compared baseline characteristics and found no statistical differences between the treatment groups apart from ocular symptoms. We used multivariate analysis to adjust for the effects of other risk factors in developing GMG. Furthermore, we found mild side-effects associated with IMS treatment, such as cushingoid appearance, with patients rarely discontinuing medication. These findings provide evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids and azathioprine.
Our retrospective cohort study had some limitations, namely, missing data, potential selection bias from treatment preferences, lack of capability for performing the serologic test and SFEMG, and the small number of patients who had long-term monitoring.

Regardless of these limitations, our study findings indicated that treatment with IMS was clearly associated with reduced conversion to and delayed onset of GMG. Randomized controlled trials or prospective studies are needed to further support our findings.
In conclusion, our patients with OMG had a low risk of developing GMG 2 years after the onset of symptoms. Our study suggests that treatment with IMS can reduce the risk of the disease developing into a more severe GMG pattern and can also delay GMG onset. Long-term follow-up of >2 years is recommended in these patients to ensure that they remain in an OMG status. We found that thymus abnormalities and positive repetitive facial nerve stimulation test result were associated with higher odds of progression to GMG; thus, investigations for thymus abnormalities and tests for positive repetitive facial nerve stimulation test result should be performed routinely for patients with OMG.

Associated With Morbidity and Mortality

Abstract: The association between the physician's first clinical impression of a patient with nonspecific complaints and morbidity and mortality is unknown. The aim was to evaluate the association of the physician's first clinical impression with acute morbidity and mortality.
We conducted a prospective observational study with a 30-day follow-up. This study was performed at the emergency departments (EDs) of 1 secondary and 1 tertiary care hospital, from May 2007 to February 2011. The first clinical impression (``looking ill''), expressed on a numerical rating scale from 0 to 100, age, sex, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were evaluated. The association was determined between these variables and acute morbidity and mortality, together with receiver operating characteristics, and validity.
Of 217,699 presentations to the ED, a total of 1278 adult nontrauma patients with nonspecific complaints were enrolled by a study team. No patient was lost to follow-up. A total of 84 (6.6%) patients died during follow-up, and 742 (58.0%) patients were classified as suffering from acute morbidity. The variable ``looking ill'' was significantly associated with mortality and morbidity (per 10 point increase, odds ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-1.34, P < 0.001, and odds ratio 1.19, 95% CI 1.14-1.24, P < 0.001, respectively).

variables ``looking ill,'' ``age,'' ``male sex,'' and ``CCI'' resulted in the best prediction of these outcomes (mortality: area under the curve [AUC] 0.77, 95% CI 0.72-0.82; morbidity: AUC 0.68, 95% CI 0.65 - 0.71).
The physician's first impression, with or without additional variables such as age, male sex, and CCI, was associated with morbidity and mortality. This might help in the decision to perform further diagnostic tests and to hospitalize ED patients.

INTRODUCTION
N onspecific complaints are frequent reasons for emergency department (ED) presentations, and almost 20% of elderly nontrauma patients present to the ED with a generally impaired condition.1 Moreover, acute presentation of weakness is associated with a broad spectrum of underlying diseases, and with mortality.2-5 Because history-taking in patients with nonspecific complaints often fails to reveal information that clearly points toward a diagnosis,6 the physician's first clinical impression and heuristics might help in the initial assessment of these patients.7,8
The role of heuristics has been examined in nursing,9-11 but little is known about the role of the physician's heuristics in decision-making.12 Nevertheless, physicians have been advised against relying on judgments based on first impressions,13-16 even if they appear to rely on heuristic processes.17
To explore the association of the physician's first impression of patients with nonspecific complaints, with acute morbidity and mortality, we performed a prospective observational study with a 30-day follow-up. Moreover, we evaluated the role of the variables age and sex, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), which is an easily determined measure used as a predictor of mortality in patients with a wide range of comorbidities.18

Study Design This study was conducted at the EDs of the University
Hospital of Basel, Switzerland, and the University-affiliated Hospital of Liestal, Switzerland. University Hospital Basel is a 700-bed tertiary care facility, with about 46,000 patients presenting to its ED per year. Liestal Hospital is a 400-bed secondary care facility with about 20,000 ED presentations each year.
The local ethics committee (Ethikkommission beider Basel) approved the study protocol, and all participating patients signed an informed consent form.

A team of certified, experienced triage nurses screened patients for study inclusion using a reliable and internationally validated triage tool, the Emergency Severity Index (ESI). This 5-level triage algorithm allows clinically relevant stratification of patients presenting to EDs.
Level 1 patients require immediate lifesaving interventions, level 2 patients are in a high-risk situation, are lethargic, confused, or have severe pain, and levels 3, 4, and 5 patients need many, 1, or no resources, respectively.19 All adult (ie, !18 years of age) nontrauma patients were eligible for inclusion to the study, if they had an ESI score of 2 or 3 and vital signs within the normal range and presented in 1 of the 2 EDs between May 24, 2007, and February 8, 2011. Excluded were patients referred from other hospitals, patients with recently performed external laboratory examinations, patients with specific complains, patients with specific electrocardiogram changes, moribund patients, patients who needed surgery, and patients who did not sign the informed consent form. Eligible patients were enrolled by a study team.
Definitions Nonspecific complaints were defined as complaints for
which there were no evidence-based management protocols for emergency physicians, on the basis of which no initial diagnosis could be made after the first assessment, with various possible or potential interpretations, or with little discriminative power in establishing a diagnosis.4
Acute morbidity was defined as any condition that was potentially life-threatening; required swift intervention to prevent deterioration of the patient's current or future health status (ie, permanent disability or death), or resulted to death within 30 days of the initial ED presentation. This definition covered a comprehensive list of conditions, details of which have been published previously.4 The numbers for acute morbidity correspond to the presentation, as adjudicated by the experts. The CCI predicts the 10-year mortality of patients by adding scores assigned to various comorbidities, such as heart disease, AIDS, or cancer.
The total score per patient is a valid predictor of both 1- and 10-year mortality.18
Data Collection and Measurements The study team consisted of physicians employed for the
conduct of this study who were instructed on how to ensure comprehension on the side of the patients. At the outset of the physician-patient interaction and before history-taking and physical examination, the physician was asked by a member of the study team to evaluate the patient's overall clinical condition by answering the following question: ``How ill does this patient look?'' Physicians were instructed to give their responses on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 to 100 points, such that a patient who appeared to be in excellent health would receive 0 points and a patient who looked extremely ill would receive 100 points. They were not informed that this first assessment would be used to predict the patients' outcomes. Baseline characteristics of all included patients were retrieved from patient records.
Follow-up For every included patient, 30-day follow-up data for
morbidity and mortality were obtained from hospital discharge reports, or from their primary care physicians. Two experts in internal medicine, unaware of patients' baseline data, evaluated all follow-up data and assigned a final primary diagnosis as well

as a final secondary diagnosis and determined the presence of acute morbidity at time of ED presentation based on the 30-day follow-up. In cases of disagreement between the 2 experts, outcomes were reevaluated by an expert panel of 2 physicians, both certified in internal medicine and emergency medicine and with at least 10 years of clinical experience. They discussed the case until a consensus was reached. Diagnoses were classified according to the World Health Organization International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision.
Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed by an independent
biostatistician. We chose the variables ``looking ill,'' age, sex, and CCI to be included in multivariate logistic regression models because they are readily available at triage. Age, sex, and CCI have been proved to predict mortality in several populations, and ``looking ill'' was the main predictor to be validated. Validity was defined as the proportion of correct predictions of outcome that a variable makes out of all possible predictions. Validity thus represents the relative frequency with which a variable correctly predicts the outcome. We called a predictor valid if it was >0.5. A predictor with a high validity is useful only if it can also be employed frequently. Therefore, we also calculated the discrimination rate (DR), that is, the relative frequency with which the predictor discriminates between any 2 patients in our sample, thereby enabling a prediction. Age was dichotomized into a group of 65 years and older, and a group <65 years.
To define the association of independent variables (ie, ``looking ill,'' ``age,'' ``male sex,'' and ``CCI'') with outcome measures (ie, acute morbidity and mortality), multivariable logistic regression models were performed. P values of <0.05 were considered to be significant. The effect of the variable ``looking ill'' was adjusted for all other variables in the model.
We analyzed the independent variable's performance by means of graphical displays, specifically by plotting P(specificity) against P(sensitivity). Used in signal-detection analyses, such displays show the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of variables, and the [P(specificity), P(sensitivity)] space is referred to as the ROC space. On the basis of the graphical display of the ROC curves and the quantitative area under the curve (AUC), we then used the method of Delong et al20 to determine the association of 3 sets of variables with mortality and acute morbidity. These 3 sets of variables were looking ill; looking ill in combination with age and male sex; and looking ill, age, and male sex in combination with CCI.
We determined the prognostic ability of each variable, independently of the others, by computing its validity. Validity was defined as the proportion of correct predictions of outcome that a variable makes relative to all possible predictions. Validity thus represents the relative frequency with which a variable correctly predicts the outcome. We called a predictor valid if it was >0.5. As a predictor with a high validity is useful only if it can also be employed frequently, we also calculated the DR, that is, the relative frequency with which the predictor discriminates between any 2 patients in our sample, thereby enabling a prediction.
RESULTS Of 217,699 presentations to the ED from May 24, 2007, through to February 2, 2011, 129,805 were not eligible because of age, dementia, trauma, referrals from other hospitals, external

laboratory, in the process of dying, or urgent surgery. Two thousand one hundred eighty patients were not eligible because of lifesaving interventions. Thirty nine thousand two hundred eighty six were not eligible because of being fast tracked as ESI 4 or ESI 5. Thirty two thousand nine hundred sixty four were not screened because of the lack of study physicians during nights and weekends. Twelve thousand one hundred sixty two were not eligible because they presented with specific complaints. One thousand three hundred two were enrolled, and 2 patients did not give informed consent. Twenty-two patients had to be excluded for protocol violations, and 1240 of the included 1278 patients could be analyzed with complete data.
A total of 496 (38.8%) were male, and 782 (61.2%) were female. The median age was 81 years. Male patients were younger than female patients (median 79 vs 83 years). Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of all included patients. Information about baseline characteristics and follow-up was available for all 1278 patients. A total of 84 (6.6%) patients died during follow-up, and 742 (58.0%) were classified as suffering from acute morbidity.
Of these patients, 147 suffered from a metabolic disorder (eg, electrolyte disorder, anemia, intoxication, drug side effects, ketoacidosis, thyroid dysfunction, or cortisol deficiency), 97 from pneumonia, 83 from heart failure, 70 from urinary tract infection, 56 from acute renal failure, 53 from cancer, 44 from dehydration, 39 from an abdominal disorder (eg, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, cholangitis, liver failure, or colitis), 32 from other infections (eg, endocarditis, skin infection, or sepsis without a defined focus), 36 from a neurological disease (eg, epileptic seizure, Parkinson disease, or Wernicke encephalopathy), 34 from stroke (ie, ischemic or intracranial bleeding), 20 from acute myocardial infarction,

and 31 from other disorders (eg, pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, osteoporotic fracture, or rheumatological disease).
First Clinical Impression as Predictor of Outcome In total, 110 physicians gave their first clinical impression
in 1240 patients. On average, each physician judged 11 patients. The average age of the 20 participating senior physicians was 38.4 (4.7 years). They had an average experience of 13.2 (4.2 years). The average age of the 90 junior physicians was 28.6 (2.6 years). They had an average experience of 3.3 (1.5 years). In logistic regression analyses, the physicians' first clinical impression (variable ``looking ill,'' data available in 1240 of 1278 (97%) patients), was significantly associated with mortality and acute morbidity (Odd ratio 1.23, 95% CI 1.12-1.34, P < 0.001, and 1.19, 95% CI 1.14-1.24, P < 0.001, respectively, per 10 point increase on the scale from 0 to 100).
For ``looking ill,'' the median (interquartile range [IQR]) was 60 (30-80). The optimal sensitivity for acute morbidity was 0.63 (95% CI 0.60-0.66), whereas the optimal specificity was 0.60 (95% CI 0.56-0.65). The optimal sensitivity for mortality was 0.54 (95% CI 0.44-0.65), whereas the optimal specificity was 0.70 (95% CI 0.67-0.73). The external validation of this novel parameter, performed in another population (all-comers) also showed a good linear relationship with morbidity (r  0.97, n  1196) and a fair median predictability for morbidity (AUC  0.72, IQR 0.70-0.73) as well as a good interrater reliability between physicians and nurses (intra class correlation  0.49) (Rohacek et al, accepted for publication in The International Journal of Clinical Practice, Dezember 2014). Moreover, the variables ``age,'' ``male sex,'' and ``CCI'' (data available in all patients) were also significantly associated with these outcomes (Table 2).
Figure 1 shows the proportions of patients with acute morbidity and mortality, dependent on scale parameters of the variable ``looking ill.''
We calculated ROC curves and AUC values, both of which are based on the corresponding logistic regression models, for the 2 outcome measures. Figure 2 shows the ROC curves for mortality based on the variable ``looking ill,'' ``looking ill'' in

combination with age and male sex, and ``looking ill,'' age and male sex, in combination with CCI. Figure 3 shows the ROC curves for acute morbidity. Table 3 lists the mean AUC values (with 95% CI) associated with the 3 sets of variables and with CCI alone. According to the AUC values, ``looking ill,'' age and male sex, in combination with CCI, yielded the best performance on both outcome variables. Using the Delong method to compare AUCs, we found that the performance levels of the 3 sets of variables were significantly different from one another at the 5% a level, with the ``looking ill,'' age and male sex, in combination with CCI, predicting the outcomes significantly better than the other 2 variable sets or CCI alone.
Finally, we determined the validities of the variables and DRs (Table 4). In predicting mortality, the variable ``looking ill'' proved to have highest validity, followed by ``CCI.'' In contrast, ``age'' had little predictive power. Interestingly, the variable ``looking ill'' discriminated in 91% of the complete set of 816,003 pair comparisons, whereas ``CCI'' discriminated in 83% of comparisons. In predicting acute morbidity, 3 of the 4 variables--namely, ``looking ill,'' ``male sex,'' and ``CCI''-- proved to be nearly equally valid, whereas age alone had low validity.

DISCUSSION
In this prospective study including a 30-day follow-up, we found that the physician's first clinical impression was associated with acute morbidity and mortality in elderly patients with nonspecific complains presenting to the ED. The combination of ``looking ill,'' with age, male sex, and the CCI resulted in the best prediction of these outcomes. Physicians appear to rely on heuristic processes in the context of their mental library of clinical signs and complaints, with pattern recognition being the most common process.17 In emergency situations time is essential, and the use of pattern recognition and other nonanalytical processes is likely to be important.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to investigate the use of the physician's first clinical impressions to predict outcomes in patients with nonspecific complaints in the ED. However, similar work has been performed in different settings. One study noted that the patient's facial expression, handshake, and entry into the consultation

room can convey information indicative of outcomes such as mortality.21 One study showed that conversational dynamics during the first 5 minutes of a negotiation could predict negotiated outcomes.22 Finally, a recent prospective study showed that nurses and physicians in a medical admission unit could accurately predict mortality of acutely admitted patients upon the patient's arrival.23
Although these studies were performed in other circumstances and with other subjects, an association between received visual information of subjects and different outcomes could be shown, as in our study. This underscores the relevance of our findings.
Our study had several limitations. First, over a hundred different physicians took part in the initial clinical assessments of patients. We did not correlate characteristics of the participating physicians with outcome prediction. Thus, the effect of physician-dependent factors such as sex, function, or experience, could not be included in the analysis. However, external validity may be enhanced by the fact that there was a wide distribution of age and experience, and a low number of judgments by the individual physicians, minimizing a ``learning bias.''
Second, information reported by paramedics, such as comorbidities and previous hospitalizations, or information about vital parameters, might have influenced the physician's first clinical impression, and could have interfered with the physician's rating of the first impression. However, our study physicians were instructed to record the first impression at the earliest time point possible.
Third, we did not perform an interrater reliability testing, and the scoring system was not validated at the time the study was conducted. However, validity and reliability was tested in an all-comer cohort and proved to be useful. Fourth, the number of not included patients who were potentially eligible was not assessed due to the availability of study physicians on weekdays only. Thus, the dimension of a possible selection bias could not be determined. Finally, this study was performed in EDs, and most patients were elderly.
Thus, generalization of our findings to other settings might not be adequate. In conclusion, we found that physicians' first clinical impression may help to predict morbidity and mortality of elderly patients presenting with nonspecific complaints to the ED. This might help in the decision to perform further diagnostic tests or to hospitalize ED patients.

Theoretical mechanism of temporary renal function improvement after abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery
Applications for clinical imaging and laboratory data

Abstract We evaluated the effects of changes in blood flow due to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery by using a simple zero-dimension model and applied theoretical values to clinical data.
The zero-dimension electronic circuit model and diagram of blood flow distribution were created by setting the resistance of the aorta, bilateral iliac arteries, renal arteries, and aneurysm. Resistance of the aneurysm and resistance of the aorta before surgery were compared with that of the aorta after surgery. We set the radius length of each anatomical parameter to calculate theoretical values.
Renal flow increased 13.4% after surgery. Next, we analyzed contrast-enhanced computed tomography data of 59 patients who underwent AAA surgery. A total of 19 patients were treated with a Y graft and 7 patients were treated with a straight graft during open surgery. However, 33 patients were treated with a bifurcated stent graft. A significant linear relationship between the increased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ratio and the decreased aneurysm ratio was found only for the straight graft group.
Using a circuit model, renal blood flow theoretically increased after AAA surgery. Clinically, there was a correlation between volume regression and eGFR improvement only in the limited AAA group.

1. Introduction
Renal function is a concern after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery. Recent studies have demonstrated that postoperative renal deterioration is associated with poor survival.[1-3] Intraoperative burden on the kidney such as temporary ischemia due to vessel clamping during pararenal AAA surgery and angiography with contrast medium during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) could cause acute renal failure.[4-6] Some reports have speculated on the mechanism of the kidney during

cardiac surgery via simulation.[7] The vascular clamp, decreased renal blood flow, and consequent renal hypoxia were assumed to be important pathways to acute renal failure.[7,8] In addition, in the case of shaggy aorta, a procedure-related shower embolism could lead to renal dysfunction.[9] In contrast, some studies have shown temporary (several days) improvement of renal function.[10,11] We have found this unique phenomenon in some cases of AAA surgery and assumed that postoperative hydration was the cause. However, we retrospectively encountered some AAA patients whose renal function improved dramatically and found that the aneurysmal diameters were relatively larger (>70 mm). Therefore, we hypothesized that decreased postoperative infrarenal blood flow volume could cause increased renal artery flow and subsequent renal improvement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of blood flow "revision" due to AAA surgery by using a simple zero-dimension model and applying theoretical values to clinical data.
2. Methods
2.1. Model
The zero-dimension electronic model was created as shown in Fig. 1. The diagram of blood flow distribution was created by setting the resistance of the aorta (Ra), resistance of the bilateral iliac arteries, resistance of the renal arteries, and resistance of the aneurysm (Raa). Raa and Ra before surgery were compared with Ra after surgery. We set the radius length of each anatomical parameter to calculate theoretical values.

2.2. Patients
This retrospective cohort study was performed according to the guidelines of the research ethics committee of the University of Tokyo Hospital (approval number: 3316(2)). All patients provided informed consent for participation. Among the patients who underwent open surgery (OS) or EVAR for infrarenal AAA at the University of Tokyo Hospital between January 2006 and August 2014, 59 who had undergone CT imaging before and after surgery wereselected. Patients withrupturedAAA, hemodialysis, renal artery reconstruction, and AAA diameter less than 50 mm were excluded.
OS was performed in 26 patients: straight graft replacement was performed in 7 patients and a bifurcated (Y) graft was used in 19 patients. EVAR with a bifurcated stent graft was performed in 33 patients. We obtained the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR: mL/min/1.73 m2) and compared the preoperative value to the maximal value within 7 days postoperatively.
2.3. Volume measurement
Using CT images obtained before and after surgery, we compared the ranges of the aorta and aneurysm to the range of the replaced site with the artificial graft or stent graft. We used the Aquarius iNtuition software (TeraRecon, San Mateo, CA) to measure volume. Because the aneurysm volume includes the intrasac thrombus, and because the software sometimes cannot recognize the aneurysm outline, especially near the thick thrombus, we performed semi-automatic measurements.
We defined the increased eGFR rate as (preoperative eGFR - postoperative maximal eGFR)/preoperative eGFR  100 (%). In addition, the decreased aneurysm rate was defined as (preoperative volume - postoperative volume)/preoperative volume  100 (%).
Statistics. Data were described as the mean  SD for continuous variables. The correlation between the increased eGFR ratio and the decreased aneurysm ratio was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. All analyses were conducted using MS Excel software. Significance was set at P < .05.
3. Results
3.1. Electric circuit model
The distribution of the infrarenal blood flow was estimated using a zero-dimension model based on viscous resistance of the flow.

The zero-dimension model was defined as shown in Fig. 1. The aneurysm was represented by a sphere and other arteries were represented by a cylinder. The electrocircuit consisted of viscous resistance of the flow in the abdominal aorta (Rab), the left and right renal arteries (Rrl and Rrr), and the left and right iliac arteries (Ril and Rir). The inflow pressure and flow rate (P0 and Q0) as well as the pressure and flow rate at each junction of the arteries were also included.
Blood pressure and the inner diameter of the arteries were assumed to be the same before and after aneurysm surgery. Considering Ohm's law (R = V/I), the flow resistance (R) of the cylinder was determined as follows:

Dp 8ml

R  Q  pr4

1

0

Here, the pressure gradient was Dp, the blood flow was Q, the

viscosity coefficient of the flow was m, and the cylinder radius was r0.

According to Ohm's law, the preoperative pressure gradient

was expressed as follows: 



DPpre  Qabpre

Rabpre  RirRil Rir  Ril

Assuming that the resistance of the right iliac artery (Rir) and left iliac artery (Ril) are the same (Ri):
 1 DPpre  Qabpre Rabpre  2 Ri

Similarly, the postoperative pressure gradient DPpost is

determined by

DPpost  Qabpost Rabpost  2 Ri

Assuming that the pressure gradient between the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries before and after surgery are the same:

This equation shows that Qab(post) decreases postoperatively if 80 the resistance increases after surgery (Rab(pre)<Rab(post)).

Next, by applying the law of conservation of mass, the

70

preoperative aortic blood flow at the orifice of the renal arteries is

expressed as the following formula:

Assuming that the blood flow of the right renal artery (Qrr) and

40

left renal artery (Qrl) are the same (Qr): 30

Postoperative blood flow (Q0(post)) at the renal orifice is calculated as follows:
Q0post  2Qrpost  Qabpost
Let us assume that aortic flow before surgery and aortic flow after surgery are the same:
Q0pre  Q0post

2Qrpre  Qabpre  2Qrpost  Qabpost

1 Qrpost  Qrpre  2 Qabpre  Qabpost沙

Then, when we substitute Eq. 2, the postoperative renal artery flow (Qr(post)) should be

1

Rabpost  Rabpre

Qrpost  Qrpre  2 Qabpre Rabpost  12 Ri 3

Because the resistance (Rab) represents 1 circuit of the

abdominal aorta and aneurysm, it should be expressed by Eq. 1:





Rab  Ra  Raa  8m  la  laa

p r4a r4aa

3.2. Theoretical value of the renal flow
We applied the following values of some clinical data to the Rab (pre) and Rab(post) equations: the length of the aneurysmal neck (la = 15 mm), the radius of the abdominal aorta (ra = 10 mm), the longitudinal length of the aneurysm (laa = 85 mm), the aneurysmal radius (raa(pre) = 25 mm), and the postoperative aortic radius (raa(post) = 10 mm).
Rabpre  8m 1:718  106 p
Rabpost  8m 107 p
Assuming that the length of the iliac artery is 20 mm (li), and that the radius is 5 mm (ri), the resistance of the iliac artery should be
Ri  8m 2:266  108 p
The result was substituted into Eq. 3; therefore, the renal arterial flow (Qr(post)) should be
Qrpost  Qrpre  Qabpre  6:718  102
Renal flow was found to increase 6.7% of the aortic flow postoperatively. Assuming that the preoperative renal flow

Figure 2. The postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was larger after surgery than before surgery. eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate.

(Qr(pre)) is approximately half of the aortic flow (Qab(pre)), the renal flow increases 13.4% after surgery.
3.3. Clinical application
Postoperative eGFR was larger after surgery (71.8  1.9 mL/min/ 1.73 m2) than before surgery (60.5  1.5 mL/min/1.73 m2) (Fig. 2). The correlation between the increased eGFR ratio and the decreased aneurysm ratio was evaluated for all patients (n = 59), for the Y graft group including EVAR (n = 52), and for the straight graft group (n = 7). A significant linear relationship was found only in the straight graft group (n = 7) (Fig. 3).
4. Discussion
Using the zero-dimension electric circuit model, we revealed an increase of 13.4% in renal flow after AAA surgery. Some surgeons who have encountered temporary renal improvement after surgery might agree with this result; however, it is only a theoretical value. This study had critical limitations. During clinical application of data, we found linear regression between the renal function and sac size in the straight graft replacement group; however, the number of cases was small. Perioperative hydration should strongly affect renal function. Using the data of 125 patients who underwent OS in our department, we discovered the following intravenous infusion values (average  SD): 6.48  6.67 mg/kg/h during surgery; 1649  683 mL on postoperative day (POD) 0; 3258  752 mL on POD 1; 2495  556 mL on POD 2; and 2125  541 mL on POD 3. It is reasonable that large infusion amounts administered for days would contribute strongly to renal function.
Few reports have focused on temporary renal improvement after AAA surgery.[10,11] Most studies determined the outcome of renal function after a longer postoperative period[1-6] because there are many confounding factors affecting renal function immediately after surgery. Our study is the first to report the theoretical value of renal flow improvement after AAA surgery, and we hope that it will help determine postoperative care strategies at other institutes.
The vasculature of the kidney is so complicated that there are many analyses using mathematical modeling[12]. Renal function was regulated by several factors such as glomerular filtration, myogenic response, and tubuloglomerular feedback. Because we focused on the inflow of the kidney, we set these details in the "black box."

Figure 3. The correlation between the increased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ratio and the decreased aneurysm ratio was evaluated for all patients (A), for the Y graft group including endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) (B), and for the straight graft group (C). A significant linear relationship was found only in the straight graft group (C). eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate, EVAR = endovascular aneurysm repair.

The idea of the zero-dimension model was created through discussions with others working in the fields of medicine and engineering. Some engineers have reported that the electric circuit model mimics blood circulation[13,14]; however, their theory was too complicated to apply clinically. No clinical report has utilized such theories for peri-operative strategies. When creating the model for our study, we focused on clinical applications and made the model as simple as possible.
5. Conclusion
Using the zero-dimension electric circuit model, renal blood flow theoretically increased after AAA surgery. Clinically, there was a correlation between volume regression and eGFR improvement only in the limited AAA group. However, other factors such as perioperative infusion volume could contribute to renal improvement.

Abstract Rationale: Actinomyces odontolyticus and Parvimonas micra are very rare causative organisms of lung abscess and acute respiratory failure.
Patient concerns: A 49-year-old male patient visited the emergency room with a complaint of sudden onset of shortness of breath, and he developed acute respiratory failure rapidly.
Diagnosis: An abscess in the left lower lung field was diagnosed on the computed tomography scan of chest.
Interventions: Immediate treatment with intravenous antibiotics was initiated along with a pigtail catheter insertion for pus drainage.
Outcomes: A odontolyticus was cultured on the drained pus and P micra was identified by a blood culture. The patient was successfully weaned from the mechanical ventilator and the lung abscess was completely resolved.
Lessons: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of mixed infection with A odontolyticus and P micra, which caused acute respiratory failure in an immune-competent patient. Therefore, physicians should consider the possibility of these organisms as causative pathogens of a fulminant pulmonary infection even in an immune-competent patient.
Keywords: Actinomyces odontolyticus, acute respiratory failure, infection, lung abscess, Parvimonas micra

1. Introduction
Lung abscess is usually caused by polymicrobial infections with anaerobes including Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, and Bacterioides, and aerobes including Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Klebsiella.[1] The incidence of actinomycosis is on the decrease and pulmonary actinomycosis accounts for less than 15% of all forms of actinomycosis. Furthermore, the prognosis of actino-

mycosis is good and mortality rate is low.[2] However, timely diagnosis and proper management of pulmonary actinomycosis are still important because aggressive forms of pulmonary actinomycosis can develop rarely.[2,3]Parvimonas micra is a commensal of the human oral cavity, which rarely causes pulmonary infections. Only a few cases of such pulmonary infections have been identified in pure culture.[4] In this article, we report a case of lung abscess due to a mixed infection with Actinomyces odontolyticus and P micra, which initially presented with acute respiratory failure. Patient has provided informed consent for publication of the case.
2. Case report
A 49-year-old male patient visited the emergency room with a complaint of sudden onset of dyspnea developed on the day of the hospital visit. He did not complain of cough or purulent sputum, and did not have fever. He was a current smoker with a 20 packyear smoking history and had a heavy alcohol drinking habit. His past medical history included hypertension.
On examination, the patient was alert and oriented. He had poor oral hygiene with extensive caries. His body temperature was 36.1캜, blood pressure was 130/70 mm Hg, respiratory rate was 35 breaths per minute, heart rate was 120 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation was 76% on room air. Despite the inhalation of 15 L/min oxygen via facial mask, the patient developed acute respiratory failure and therefore, mechanical ventilation was started.

Liver function test showed total bilirubin of 1.59 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 513 U/L, aspartate transaminase of 43 U/L, alanine transaminase of 42 U/L. In addition, renal function test showed blood urea nitrogen of 24.9 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.86 mg/dL.
The initial chest radiographs showed a consolidation in the left lower lung field (Fig. 1A). A computed tomography scan of the chest showed a large lung abscess with an air-fluid level in the left lower hemithorax (Fig. 1B). Ceftriaxone and clindamycin were administered promptly and a percutaneous pigtail catheter was inserted to drain the abscess. The drained fluid was purulent in gross appearance. The patient was successfully weaned from the mechanical ventilator on the 6th day of the hospital visit. A odontolyticus was sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, cephalosporin, tetracycline, clindamycin, and erythromycin. P micra was sensitive to Penicillin, amoxicillin, clindamycin. Therefore, the antibiotics were changed to ampicillin-sulbactam, and the patient recovered faster. The oral examination revealed swelling and redness of gingiva, accumulation of dental calculus, and gingival bleeding on probing. The percutaneous drainage catheter was removed on the 12th day of the hospital visit. The patient was discharged on the 26th day from admission with markedly improved symptoms and general condition. After discharge, oral amoxicillin/clavulanate was prescribed as maintenance therapy for 6 months and the left lung lesion was resolved (Fig. 2).

3. Discussion
Lung abscess due to A odontolyticus or P micra is very rare, and co-infection with both organisms causing lung abscess and acute respiratory failure had not been reported. The Actinomyces species are gram-positive bacteria and are facultative anaerobes.[2,3]P micra is also a facultative, anaerobic, grampositive bacterium.[4] These 2 species are often found in the human oropharynx.[3,4] Pulmonary infection by A odontolyticus or P micra result from the aspiration of these species into the lungs. In this article, we reported a case of lung abscess and
respiratory failure in an immune-competent patient caused by
these 2 organisms.
A prompt diagnosis and an adequate treatment of pulmonary
actinomycosis are important even though it is a relatively rare
disease with a low mortality rate. The computed tomography findings of pulmonary actinomycosis provide limited information; therefore, the confirmative diagnosis of pulmonary actinomycosis is made by a microscopic examination of pus or lung biopsy sample.[2,5] A case of pulmonary actinomycosis of periodontal origin by Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces viscosus was reported previously.[6] A case of periodontal disease-associated septic pulmonary embolism by Actinomyces species was also reported, but the specific species was not mentioned.[7] This case highlights the potential pathogenic role of A odontolyticus of periodontal origin as a risk factor for lung infection.
The pulmonary infection by P micra is also very rare and P micra is rarely identified in pure culture. This organism usually causes periradicular diseases and periodontitis, with other microorganisms.[4] Poetter et al reported a case of pleural empyema in which P micra was cultured from the pleural pus.[4] In our case, A odontolyticus was identified by the pleural fluid culture and P micra was identified by the blood culture.
Although pulmonary actinomycosis is rare and difficult to diagnose, prognosis is relatively good if it is properly treated.[2,8]
There are no guidelines for antibiotics treatment for pulmonary actinomycosis and P micra infection yet. The recommended therapy for these infections is 4 to 6 weeks of intravenous penicillin followed by a 6 to 12 months oral regimen.[2,4,9] In this
case, the patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics for 15

days along with percutaneous drainage and further treated with oral antibiotics for several months.
This case highlights the potential pathogenic role of A odontolyticus and P micra in immune-competent patients with lung abscess. Physicians should consider these organisms as causative pathogens of lung abscess and acute respiratory failure, especially when the evidence of periodontitis exists.

Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is one of the most common malignant tumors and has high incidence and mortality rates. The interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family is known as a key transcription factor in the IFN signaling pathway and cellular immunity. This research explored the relationship between the IRF family and COAD through use of bioinformatics technology. Using the UALCAN and GEPIA databases, we analyzed the transcription and prognostic value of IRFs in COAD, and GSCALite was used in cancer genomics analysis. TIMER, LinkedOmics, and Metascape were used to assess the potential function of IRFs in COAD. The transcription levels of IRF3 were elevated in COAD tissues, while IRF2/4/6 were downregulated compared with normal patients in subgroup analyses of race, age, weight, sex, nodal metastasis, individual cancer stages, TP53 mutation status, and histological subtypes. IRF3 and IRF7 in COAD were significantly associated with a poor prognosis. Drug sensitivity analysis revealed that the expression level of IRF2/4/8 was negatively associated with drug resistance. A significant correlation was found between the IRF family and immune cell infiltration. Moreover, enrichment analysis revealed that the IRFs were associated with response to tumor necrosis factor, transcription misregulation in cancer, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway. We also identified several kinase and miRNA targets of the IRF family in COAD. We identified IRF3 and IRF7 as prognostic biomarkers in COAD, and the IRF family was associated with immune cell infiltration and gene regulation networks, providing additional evidence showing the significant role of the IRF family in COAD.

Yuemaier M. et al.: The role of IRFs in COAD  Med Sci Monit, 2020; 26: e927073

Background
Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) has a high incidence rate and is the third most common adenocarcinoma worldwide. Highrisk groups include people older than 50 years, with a family history, and with hereditary familial polyposis, as well as younger patients, who, unfortunately, tend to be diagnosed at a more advanced stage of COAD. To identify these patients more quickly and easily, reliable biomarkers are needed to predict disease status and prognosis. In 2018 alone, there were over 1.8 million new colon cancer cases and 880 000 COADrelated deaths. Notably, the disease is beginning to develop at a younger age [1,2]. Despite the decreased incidence of COAD-related deaths because of improvements in early detection through screening programs, including endoscopy and fecal occult blood testing, patients continue to present with advanced disease [3]. Molecular markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9(CA199), have been used in COAD diagnosis. However, patients at all COAD stages continue to die of the disease [4,5]. Therefore, exploring reliable biomarkers of the early pathological changes from the molecular mechanism could be crucial for early diagnosis, overall survival prediction, treatment effect, and targeted therapy development.
Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) belong to the family of transcription factors and include IRF1-IRF9 members in both humans and mice. They are known for their critical roles in adaptive immunity [6]. Nonetheless, they are expressed in all tissue cells except for immune cells. Accumulating evidence indicates that IRFs crucially function in cell differentiation and apoptosis, cell cycle, and immunological regulation, which are associated with tumor progression [7,8]. Studies have shown that IRFs are involved in tumorigenesis by activating tumor-related gene transcription [9]. For instance, the elevated expression level of IRF2 in cancer cells promotes the activity of NF-kB during delivery of the activators (such as TNF-a). By enhancing the activity of NF-kB, the carcinogenic potential of IRF2 is increased [10]. However, the differences in the expression levels, molecular mechanisms, genetic variations, and prognostic significance of most IRFs in COAD have not been thoroughly studied. In the present study, we performed bioinformatics analysis in public databases, including ULACAN, GEPIA, TCGA, and TIMER, to explore the correlation between IRF family members and COAD.
Material and Methods
Datasets
A total of 286 COAD patients were enrolled from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. None of them had received any

form of chemoradiotherapy. We assessed the IRFs at the mRNA level using the following bioinformatics portals.
UALCAN
UALCAN (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu) was used for evaluation of differences in IRF expression profiles between COAD and healthy tissues in the TCGA COAD dataset (n= 286). This site analyzes the relative expression of a target gene(s) of the tumor and normal samples, including the analysis of tumor subgroups based on individual cancer stage, tumor grade, or other clinicopathologic features [11]. Using these functions, we assessed the relationship between IRFs expression level and patient survival using the t test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
GEPIA
We used the online database Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/index.html), a web-based tool to deliver gene expression correlation analysis with data based on TCGA. The functions that GEPIA provides include correlation analysis, patient survival analysis, and profiling plotting [12]. Through use of this database, we assessed correlations between the expression level of IRFs and disease-free survival (DFS)/overall survival (OS) in COAD. The top 10 genes correlated with each IRFs member in COAD were analyzed using the Spearman correlation test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
GSCALite
GSCALite (http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/web/GSCALite/) provides a methylation module to establish the IRFs methylation level in COAD [13]. The t test was used to define differences in methylation between tumor and normal samples. We tested the association between paired mRNA expression and methylation based on Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient, and it follows a t distribution. P values were adjusted by FDR, with FDR 0.05 considered as significant. Moreover, the single-nucleotide variation (SNV) frequency and variant types of IRFs in COAD, as well as the association between the IRF family and drug sensitivity, were explored. The SNV summary and oncoplot waterfall plot were generated using maftools [14].
TIMER
The Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) (cistrome. shinyapps.io/timer) is a public web resource that can infer the abundance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) from the gene expression profiles. The 6 major analytic modules, including gene expression, clinical outcomes, and somatic mutations. They enable users to analyze the correlation between immune

infiltrations and various factors [15]. In the present study, the IRFs expression was correlated with the abundance of immune cell infiltrates in COAD as assessed with the gene module, and the results are displayed by scatter plots. Furthermore, to compare TIICs abundance in COAD with different copy number distortions of the IRF family, we used SCNA modules, and for each TIIC subset, a box plot was generated to compare the distribution of the abundance of TIICs with different gene mutation status, with the statistical significance estimated using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. This analysis was performed based on the TCGA COAD dataset (n=286). P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

LinkedOmics
LinkedOmics (http://www.linkedomics.org/) includes multi-omics data and clinical data for 32 cancer types from the TCGA dataset [16]. We performed kinase target enrichment and miRNA target enrichment of the IRF family in COAD. The results are graphically presented in volcano plots, heat maps, or scatter plots. The rank criterion was the minimum number of genes (size) of 9 and the simulation of 500, and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Metascape
Metascape (http://metascape.org) is a productive gene function annotation analysis tool to annotate a large number of genes and to identify enriched pathways [17]. The top 10 genes correlated with each IRFs member in COAD were extracted from the GEPIA dataset, and these genes were analyzed through Metascape. With GO and KEGG methods, we are able to analyze a gene list related to IRFs to identify the most frequently altered linked genes and constructed protein-protein interaction networks from lists of genes and proteins.

Results
Expression level of IRFs in COAD
The differences in transcription levels of IRFs between COAD and normal tissues were evaluated using the UALCAN databases to study the expression profiles of IRFs in COAD patients. Compared with normal tissues, IRF3 (Figure 1C, P=1.62E-12) was upregulated in COAD tissues (Figure 1). However, IRF2 (Figure 1B, P=4.39E-12), IRF4 (Figure 1D, P=1.55E-08), IRF6 (Figure 1F, P=8.56E-04), and IRF7 (Figure 1G, P=5.01E-03) were downregulated in COAD tissues relative to the healthy tissues, and there were no significant differences in the transcription

levels of IRF1/5/8/9 between COAD and healthy tissues. Additionally, UALCAN allowed us to discover the relationship between the expression levels of IRFs in COAD and pathological clinical features. The boxplots indicate that transcription levels of IRF2 (Figure 2A), IRF4 (Figure 3A), and IRF6 (Figure 3B) in COAD patients were downregulated compared with normal patients in subgroup analyses regarding race, age, weight, sex, nodal metastasis, individual cancer stages, TP53 mutation status, and histological subtypes. In contrast, the IRF3 mRNA levels (Figure 2B) were higher in COAD patients than in healthy persons in the subgroup analyses in all pathological clinical features. There was no significant change in IRF7 (Figure 3C). Interestingly, the expression levels of IRF3 were significantly different, and overweight and male patients had much higher IRF3 mRNA levels. Moreover, regarding nodal metastasis, the IRF3 levels in the N2 stage were noticeably higher than in the other stages. In the TP53-nonmutant type and mucinous adenocarcinoma, IRF3 mRNA levels were distinctly upregulated. In the methylation analysis, the methylation levels of most IRFs in COAD tissues were elevated, whereas IRF1 was downregulated (Figure 4A). In addition, methylation was negatively correlated with the expression of IRFs in COAD (Figure 4B).
Prognostic value of IRF family in COAD
GEPIA established the prognostic value of IRFs expression levels in COAD patients. In COAD patients, high expression levels of IRF3/7 were significantly associated with poor OS (Figure 5A). However, the expression level of IRFs in COAD patients was

independent of DFS (Figure 5B). Overall, elevated mRNA levels of IRF3/7 were significantly associated with poor prognosis; therefore, IRF3/7 are potential biomarkers for predicting the survival of COAD patients.
Genetic variation
The genetic variation in the IRF family in COAD is shown in Figure 6. These variations include missense mutation, splice site, frameshift insertion, frameshift deletion, multi-hit, nonsense mutation, and in-frame deletion (Figure 6). Next, the role of the IRF family in crucial cancer-related pathways was evaluated. We established that the IRF family is involved in activation of tumor cell apoptosis pathways and the hormone ER pathway. We also found that IRFs inhibit the cell cycle and DNA damage pathways (Figure 7). Therefore, genomic aberrations could serve as potential biomarkers for drug screening and affect clinical responses to treatment. Drug sensitivity analysis showed the expression levels of IRF2/4/8 were negatively associated with drug resistance (Figure 8).
Immune infiltration of IRF family in COAD patients
We next used the TIMER web resource to investigated whether IRFs expression is related to immune infiltration levels in COAD. Tumor purity is an important factor in using genomic approaches because it influences the analysis of immune infiltration in clinical tumor samples [18]. The expression levels of IRF family members in COAD was associated with infiltrating immune

Figure 5. The prognostic value of mRNA level of IRFs in COAD. In COAD patients, the upregulated IRF3/7 was significantly related to the poor OS (A), while all members of the IRF family showed no prognostic value in DFS (B). The expression of other IRFs had no association with OS in COAD patients.

cells, including neutrophils, CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells, macrophage B cells, and CD4+ T cells (Figure 9, Table 1). In general, our results reveal the relationship between IRFs expression levels and immune infiltration levels in COAD. Additionally, the copy number variations in the IRF family suppressed the levels of infiltrating immune cells (Figure 10).
Enrichment analysis of IRF family in COAD
We further investigated the potential role of IRFs in COAD pathogenesis and development via gene enrichment analysis of the pathways and processes in 90 neighboring genes (Figure 11, Table 2). IRFs and the vicinal genes were significantly

enriched in molecular functions (MF), biological processes (BP), cellular component (CC), and pathways involved in interactions. GO enrichment analysis showed highly enriched signal regulation pathways, including type I interferon signaling cascade, response to interferon-gamma, regulation of cytokine production, response to tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-27-mediated signaling axis (Figure 11A, 11B, Table 3). The top 7 KEGG pathways of the IRF family members and adjacent genes are shown in Figure 11C, 11D and Table 4. Among these pathways, RIG-I-like receptor-signaling cascade, viral carcinogenesis, HTLV-1 infection, and transcription misregulation in cancer were associated with the development and pathogenesis of COAD. Moreover, the mCODE was retrieved and revealed

that the IRF family and adjacent genes participate in the JAKSTAT signaling pathway and tuberculosis (Figure 11E, 11F).
Kinase and miRNA targets of IRF family in COAD
To determine the role of IRFs in COAD, we then explored the kinase target and miRNA target of the IRF family in COAD (Table 5). The results suggested that kinase LCK and LYN are common targets of IRF1/4/7/8/9. The kinase target of IRF5 is

SYK and FYN. Kinase ATR as well as STK are kinase targets for IRF6. The kinase targets of IRF3 are IKBKB and PLK3. The miRNA targets of IRFs are shown in Table 6. The (TGTATGA) MIR17-5P, MIR-20A, MIR-106A, MIR-106B, MIR-20B, MIR519D, and (TGTATGA) MIR-485-3P were suggested to be the miRNA targets of IRF3. (CCAGGGG) MIR-331 and (CAGTCAC) MIR-134 were suggested to be the miRNA targets of IRF7.

Discussion
The prognosis of COAD mainly depends on the extent of disease, and lack of reliable biomarkers results in late diagnosis and high mortality in COAD [19]. If a genetic diagnosis can be used to detect COAD at an early stage for effective intervention, the prognosis of patients will be greatly improved. The IRF family plays an important function in cancer immunobiology. During tumorigenesis, each member strictly controls the production and function of cells involved in the antitumor immune response [20]. The diverse role of IRFs in cancers has

been reported, suggesting that IRFs modulate tumor progression and could be used as biomarkers. However, for COAD, there is no such specific description of the correlation between IRFs and COAD.
Firstly, we explored the transcription level of IRFs in COAD. IRF2/4/6 was downregulated in COAD patients regarding all kind of clinic pathologic features, while only IRF3 was highly expressed in COAD tissues. IRF1/5/8/9 showed the result was not statistically significant; however, a few studies showed that increased IRF1 and IRF2 levels were found in CRC tissues, and

Correlation of immune cell landscape of COAD compared with TCGA gene expression of IRFs (TIMER). r - categorized Pearson's correlation coefficient; (- -): -0.5 to -0.3, weak negative association; (-): -0.3 to 0.1, little association; (+): +0.1 to 0.3, little association; (++): +0.3 to +0.5, weak positive association; (+++): +0.5 to +1.0, strong positive association.

the high expression level of IRF2 was related to a more than 2-fold increase in the risk of all-cause mortality in CRC patients [21,22]. Although IRF7 was downregulated in COAD tissues, IRF3 and IRF7 were significantly associated with poorer overall survival. These data indicate that differentially expressed IRFs may play a significant role in COAD. As a recent study suggests, b-catenin is overexpressed in colorectal cancer and its expression level is positively associated with the level of IRF3 in CRC cells [23].
The present study demonstrates the molecular characteristics of IRFs in COAD. In COAD, the frequent genetic alterations in

IRFs were differentially expressed. Genomic aberrations could serve as potential biomarkers for drug screening and affect clinical responses to treatment. Drug sensitivity analysis shows the expression levels of IRF2/4/8 were negatively associated with drug resistance, indicating that they are potential novel markers for drug screening.
Next, we focused on immune cell infiltration. Interestingly, in COAD patients, IRF3/5/7 had a weak correlation with B cells and CD8+ T cells infiltration level, while IRF1/2/4/6/8/9 showed a strong correlation with infiltration levels of all 6 types of immune cells (neutrophils, CD8+ T cells, dendritic

cells, macrophage, B cells, and CD4+ T cells), and the change of copy number in the IRF family inhibits the level of infiltrating immune cells. Unlike the other IRF members, IRF3 expression had a very weak correlation with infiltration levels of B cells, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells, but had a significant correlation with the CD4+T cells infiltration level in COAD patients. Studies revealed that, compared with normal colon tissues, there were more CD4+T cells in colorectal cancer tissues [24], and the correlation between IRF3 and CD+4 T cells suggested its role as a biomarker of IRF3 in COAD.

With GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, we found a potential role of IRFs in COAD development. The IRF family was mostly enriched in the type I interferon signaling cascade, which was expected because, expect for IRF6, the other members are all the primary regulator of type I IFN activation. The type I IFN signaling pathway is important for innate antiviral immunity, and pathway damage is related to increased risk of tumorigenesis. IRF9 can enhance the p53 pathway when cells are exposed to endogenous induced or exogenous type I interferon, suggesting that IRF9

has an anti-proliferation effect [7,20]. Results also showed that the IRFs were mainly associated with response to tumor necrosis factor, transcription misregulation in cancer, and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The JAK-STAT pathway is a common signal transduction pathway, but under pathological conditions, the activation of this pathway is associated with the proliferation of many malignant tumors [25]. An immunohistochemical experiment showed that the expression levels of JAK-1 and STAT-3 proteins were upregulated in colon cancer

tissues, and the levels were an independent risk factor for the prognosis of colon cancer [26]. As our study showed, IRFs are closely related to the JAK-STAT pathway, which suggests that the high expression level of IRF3/7 in COAD patients may have a deeper relationship with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in tumor development.
Finally, due to the different interactions of IRFs and the SRC family tyrosine kinases (LCK, LYN, and FYN), they play different roles

in oncogenesis. The common kinase targets of IRF1/4/7/8/9 are LCK and LYN. LCK is important in tumorigenesis because the expression level of LCK is elevated in colorectal cancer cells, suggesting that LCK has a cancer-promoting role in CRC [27,28]. As the common kinase target of IRF5/6, SYK has been found to be a cancer suppressor in colorectal cancer [29]. PLK3, which is the kinase target of IRF3, contributes to regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, and studies showed that PLK3 was overexpressed in breast and ovarian cancer, but there is little evidence of the role of PLK3 in COAD [30]. The miRNA targets of IRF3 are upregulated in human colon cancer. For example, MIR-17-5p and MIR-20a are both highly expressed in colon cancer tissues, and the MIR-106 family was also found to be closely involved in the initiation and development of colorectal cancer [31,32]. On the contrary, the miRNA target of IRF7, MIR-331, was reported to be a tumor suppressor in colorectal carcinoma [33].
This study is the first to systematically demonstrate the association between the IRF family and COAD; however, it has some limitations. Because all the information was obtained

from public databases, there are many influencing factors, such as the size and location of the tumor, and the medical parameters are incomplete, which could influence the results. Since the IRFs are correlated with cell cycle control and apoptosis, carcinogenesis, and immune responses, further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism involved.
Conclusions
Overall, these results indicate that IRF3 and IRF7 are prognostic biomarkers in COAD, and IRF family members are associated with immune cell infiltration and gene regulation networks. These results add to the growing evidence of the significant role of IRFs in COAD, and contribute to developing the prognostic value of IRFs in COAD.
Conflict of interests
None.

OKIGINAL COMMUNICATIONS.

Article I.- -Amputation at the Ankle. By James Syme, Esq., Professor of Clinical Surgery in the University of Edinburgh.

In the number of this journal for last month, I find the following

passage extracted from a foreign medical periodical:?

" A tibio-tarsal amputation was performed some years ago on a

young soldier, by Dr Baudens. The patient could walk very well

for a year afterwards with an ordinary shoe, attached by two metallic

splints. He walked considerable distances in this manner without

fatigue, ascended and descended stairs easily, danced and leapt with

agility. This patient afterwards entered the hospital wards of

the Hotel des Invalides, where he has remained several months.

His stump became excessively painful; the cicatrix re-opened, and

ulcerated in many places. Two abscesses, Avhich formed in the

tissue of the cicatrix, were opened a few days ago, by M. Hutin,

and it is probable that the subjacent bones were diseased. The

patient experiences great suffering, and eagerly demands another

amputation near the knee.

" This case gives rise to certain questions, of wThich our readers

have to demand an account. First, we must remark, that the

indifference with which civil and military surgeons have received

the memoir of M. Baudens, is no proof of the non-value of the

operation, for it has been performed by Mr Syme of Edinburgh a

dozen times with perfect success. It is true, however, that Mr

Syme has generally operated on children, and that he has only

published the immediate results of the operation. Now the ques-

tion is, what are the remote consequences ? since, in the case of

M. Baudens, the cicatrix did not inflame, ulcerate, or re-open, for

more than a year after the operation. It becomes the more im-

portant to know the actual state of Mr Syme's cases, as it might

enable us to decide, whether the bad condition of the cicatrix in the patient now at Les Invalides depends on a constitutional disease (as we presume is the case), or on the form of the flaps, or of the stump. We should remember, however, that in the operation of M. Baudens, the head of the malleolus was sawn through after the disarticulation, whilst Mr Syme preserves the malleolus intact. We must say, that until new facts enlighten us on the subject, and notwithstanding the great aversion that the civil and military surgeons of Paris experience in adopting the tibio-tarsal operation, we persist in believing it advantageous in many cases. We amputate at the articulation of the wrist, why then hesitate at the same point in the inferior extremity ?" 1 - With reference to this statement, I beg to mention,?1. That I . have operated in more nearly two than one dozen of cases with perfect success,?2. That most of the patients have been adults,? 3.,That I have in no instance "preserved the malleolus intact;" * . and have always removed the whole articulating surface, except ..c. oflce" or twice, when I detached the malleolar processes, by means of cutting pliers; having on all other occasions sawn off a thin slice from the tibia, connecting the projections of bone at each side? and, 4. That the following letters relative to the two cases, which were first subjected to the operation, and gave rise to my original papers, will, I hope, be considered satisfactory evidence as to the " remote consequences." In the first of these cases, the disease being seated between the astragalus and os calcis, only the malleolar parts of the articular surface of the ankle were removed. In the second, as the ankle joint itself was extensively carious, the whole articulating surface was removed by the saw.
As to the mode of performing the operation, I have nothing to say in addition to what has been already stated, except that I find a flap sufficiently large for the purpose, is obtained by cutting from the centre of one malleolus to that of the other, right across the sole of the foot; the dissection from the os calcis is thus facilitated, and the risk of sloughing lessened, if not entirely prevented.
From Thomas Aitchison, Esq., Surgeon, Dunbar, to Mr Syme. Dunbar, 4th June 1846.
My Dear Sir,?It gave me great pleasure to hear, by yours of the 2d instant, that the boy Fargie's case is likely to terminate so satisfactorily.
I sent for the boy Wood, whose life was spared by a similar operation, executed by you two or three years ago (September 1842, age 16). I examined most carefully the stump, which was
all sound. He had had a renewal of the false foot since he had seen you. He told me he suffered no inconvenience from the stump,
or the slightest tenderness. He has become a country tailor, and

has often ten and fifteen miles a day to go to his work; still he feels

no discomfort. He says, he, with a few of his young comrades, ran

off to see the operations of the North British Railway at Penman-

shiel tunnel, and must have walked fully thirty to thirty-five miles,

without feeling his amputated limb.

You may rely upon it, nothing can be more satisfactory than this

case of the boy Wood; and if Fargie's and all similar cases prove,

under your hands, as successful, amputation at the ankle-joint,

and its effects, will prove the greatest blessing to the human race,

especially those unfortunates so afflicted.?I am, my dear Sir, yours

most faithfully,

Thos. Aitchison.

The young man Fargie, alluded to by Mr Aitchison, had suffered

from caries of the tarsus for fourteen years. He had the foot ampu? v

tated, and left the hospital, restored to health, and with a sound

Edinburgh, 9th June 1846? j Dear Sir,?You will remember that I lost my foot in January 1843. The stump healed rapidly, and in six weeks had all closed, except one small aperture, from which a slight watery discharge continued to come till the month of June, when it suddenly ceased, and complete cicatrization occurred. Since that period, I have experienced no pain, or uneasy sensation of any kind, in the stump, nor any tenderness, making standing or walking irksome or unpleasant. I have very rarely experienced the feeling of the lost foot being still part of the body and the seat of pain, which is so common a complaint among those who have been deprived of limbs.
For the last two years, I am not aware that I have known this
sensation at all; if I have, it has made no impression on my memory. I can lean the weight of my body on the naked stump without inconvenience; and, with a single stocking over it, am in the habit of walking through the house when my boot is not at hand.
The artificial foot I wear, within an ordinary half boot, is made of light wood, with a spring across the part corresponding to the roots of the toes. This spring, however, is of no use, as the rigidity of the boot enclosing it prevents it acting. The foot might as well be made of one piece of wood. At the heel, it is hollowed into a concavity, corresponding to the shape of the stump, but rising up before and behind into two prolongations, which, seen in section,
would resemble the horns of a crescent. The foot is cased in
shamois leather, which is carried up from the borders of the concavity, and cut into the shape of the upper part of a lady's cloth boot. Like it, also, it is laced up the inner side, and has a tongue ; the latter is made of thick soft leather, and is of much service in securing the fitting of the foot. There are no straps or buckles, or steel supports of any kind, nor are they needed. From the bulbous form of the stump, and its circumference being considerably greater

than that of the leg above it, the lacing of the upper leather completely suffices to hold the artificial foot on. It would be impossible, indeed, to pull it off, without loosening the lace or tearing the
leather.

The artificial foot, as originally furnished, was thickly padded;

but I found the padding so apt to shift, and so liable to become

uncomfortable from saturation with moisture, that I had it all

Abstract
Introduction: The association between red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), so-called transfusion-associated NEC (ta-NEC), was first described in 1987. However, further work is needed to confirm a causal relationship, elucidate underlying mechanisms, and develop possible strategies for prevention. We performed an extensive literature search in the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus.
Areas covered: Although multiple retrospective human studies have strongly suggested an association between blood transfusions and subsequent occurrence of NEC, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing RBC transfusion thresholds or the use of recombinant erythropoiesis-stimulating growth factors did not confirm an association of anemia with ta-NEC. These conflicting data necessitated the development of an animal model to elucidate mechanisms and causal factors. Data from this recent mouse model of ta-NEC highlighted the importance of sequential exposure to severe anemia followed by transfusion for development of ta-NEC.
Expert opinion: This review summarizes current human and experimental data, highlights open questions, and suggests avenues for further research aimed at preventing ta-NEC in preterm infants. Further studies are required to delineate whether there is a tipping point, in terms of the level and duration of anemia, and to develop an effective strategy for blood management and the quality of RBC transfusions.

Introduction
Premature infants are a heavily transfused population.1,2 Up to 90% of extremely low birth weight infants, and approximately 60% of preterm infants born at <32 weeks of gestational age receive red blood cell (RBC) transfusions during the neonatal period.3 In several reports, up to 25-40% of infants who developed necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) may have received RBC transfusion(s) in the preceding 48 hours, and this connection has been referred to as transfusion-associated NEC (ta-NEC).4-26 However, these results have not been conclusive in systematic reviews of case-control or observational studies.6,27-29 In contrast, ta-NEC has not been associated to anemia in RCTs on RBC transfusion thresholds and in studies on the efficacy of recombinant erythropoiesis-stimulating factors.30,31 These problems indicated a need for focused preclinical and clinical studies. However, the interest in the association between anemia and ta-NEC has been rekindled following a recent comprehensive animal study.32

Herein, we review the current data on ta-NEC and its possible mechanisms and then recommend future direction of research and clinical practice. We performed an extensive literature search in the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus. To minimize bias, key words from the medical subject heading thesaurus on PubMed were shortlisted prior to the actual search and combined with text words used in titles and abstracts.

RBC Transfusions as a Potential Trigger of NEC in Very Preterm Infants
The association between transfusions and NEC was first observed by McGrady et al.33 in 1987, who investigated an outbreak of 33 cases of NEC in their neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and reported that many cases followed RBC transfusions (odds ratio [OR] = 15.1, confidence interval [CI]: [2.59-92.51]).33 In 1998, Bednarek et al.34 noted that NICUs with fewer transfusions had less NEC (OR = 0.3, CI: [0.1-0.8]). Several subsequent studies confirmed that 25-40% of very preterm infants who developed NEC had received one or more RBC transfusions in the preceding 2-48 hours, generally about 12 hours, before the onset of NEC.5,11,13,21,23,25,26,33-41 These studies suggested that ta-NEC occurred (a) in infants born at earlier gestational ages than those who developed NEC unrelated to transfusion;5,11,13,21,23,25,26,33-39 (b) at 3-5 weeks after birth, later than NEC unrelated to transfusions seen at 1-3 weeks;5,13,21,23,25,26,33-39 (c) in neonates who had received 1-3 RBC transfusions;5,25 and (d) in infants who may have had a higher acuity of illness prior to developing NEC.6,11,13,23,26,39,40 The postnatal age of infants who developed ta-NEC was higher than those who developed NEC without a temporally proximate transfusion.5,13,25 However, the storage age of donor blood transfused into infants who developed ta-NEC was not different from that in matched controls who did not develop NEC.4
Most studies of ta-NEC were based on a small number of patients, and therefore, lack generalizability and the statistical power to adjust for confounders. Therefore, there have been several efforts focused on meta-analysis of pooled data. In one of these early reports, Mohamed and Shah6 systematically reviewed 11 observational studies of NEC and confirmed increased odds of NEC within a 48-hour period following an RBC transfusion. Another meta-analysis of five studies showed increased risk of NEC following transfusions in the previous 48 hours (pooled OR = 3.91, 95% CI: [2.97-5.14]; I2 = 58%).5,11,21,25,42 A meta-analysis of four studies also showed increased risk of NEC (pooled OR = 2.01, 95% CI: [1.61-2.50]; I2 = 91%).25,38,43 Another study that combined seven case-control studies (480 blood transfusion cases, 2,845 control cases) showed similar results in a random-effects model (OR = 3.35, 95% CI: [1.54-7.27]).27 Sensitivity analysis showed an increased OR for NEC within 48 hours after transfusion at 4.21 (95% CI: [2.17-8.16]). The OR was 4.29 (95% CI: [1.39-13.24]) after factors such as gestational age and birth weight were deconfounded.27
The evidence for an association between RBC transfusions and NEC became less convincing following a comprehensive meta-analysis of 17 observational studies by Garg et al.,44 who did not find supportive results (OR = 0.96, 95% CI [0.53-1.71], p = 0.88) (Table 1). Rai et al.45 performed a meta-analysis with 10 studies, and actually noted a 45% reduction in the unadjusted odds of NEC in infants exposed to a recent RBC transfusion (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: [0.31-0.98]).

A prospective, matched-pair comparison of 42 NEC cases and their controls at three centers found no association between transfusions with NEC in the subsequent 48 h or 7 days.46 Elabiad et al.22 reviewed a large cohort of 3060 infants and identified 174 infants (5.7%) with NEC. They noted that 116 (67%) infants had been exposed to RBC transfusions; infants with BW 750; 751-1,000; 1,001-1,250; and 1,251-1,500 g had a relative risk of 0.14, 0.46, 1.83 and 1.78, respectively, to develop NEC following transfusions. They concluded that RBC transfusions significantly reduced the risk of NEC in 1,000 g infants, but noted a trend towards increased risk of NEC in infants with a birth weight of 1,001-1,500 g.

Anemia as Risk Factor for NEC in Very Preterm Infants
In a prospective, multicenter observational cohort study, Patel et al.12 evaluated 598 very low birthweight infants and noted that 44 (7.4%) developed NEC. In this cohort, however, 319 (53%) infants were exposed to RBC transfusions. The unadjusted cumulative incidence of NEC at 8 weeks after birth was 9.9% (95% CI [6.9-14.2%]), which was higher than the 4.6% (95% CI [2.6-8.0%], p = 0.02) incidence among those who were not transfused with RBCs (p = 0.02). In multivariable analysis, RBC transfusion in a given week was not significantly related to the rate of NEC (adjusted cause-specific hazard ratio 0.44 (95% CI [0.17-1.12]), p = 0.09). Based on the evaluation of 4,565 longitudinal measurements of hemoglobin concentrations (median = 7 g/dL per infant), they associated NEC with severe anemia (adjusted cause-specific hazard ratio 5.99 (95% CI [2.00-18.0]); p = 0.001), but not with RBC transfusions.12 A recent retrospective single-center cohort study in 207 extremely premature infants (23-27 wk gestation) identified a portion of 46% (13/28) of infants with ta-NEC and 54% (15/28) with non-ta-NEC. The incidence of ta-NEC, however, did not correlate with the number of antecedent pRBC transfusions or the pretransfusion median hemoglobin levels.40
These reports of the association of NEC with anemia were interesting. However, the impact of anemia on the risk of NEC remains uncertain. Two recent studies (ETTNO, TOP) compared liberal (higher) and restrictive (lower) RBC transfusion thresholds in extremely low birthweight infants, but did not find an association between NEC and low pretransfusion hematocrit/hemoglobin values.47 In the ETTNO trial, including 1013 infants, the absolute difference in the incidence of NEC (modified Bell stage  IIa) in the liberal (hematocrit on day >21: <34% or <28% in critical or noncritical state) vs restrictive (hematocrit on day >21: <27% or <21% in critical or noncritical state) transfusion threshold was -0.9 (95% CI [-3.8-2.0]).48 The TOP trial included 1,824 infants; the adjusted relative risk for NEC (Bell's stage 2) at high (weeks 3: 11.0 g/dl with or 10.0 g/dL without ventilator support) vs low (weeks 3: 8.5 g/dL with or 7.0 g/dL without ventilator support) hemoglobin thresholds was 0.95 (95% CI [0.73-1.25]).47
Some studies have evaluated the impact of recombinant human erythropoietin (rEpo), or its derivative darbepoietin, given to reduce anemia and the need for transfusions, on NEC. Ohlsson and Aher49 performed a meta-analysis to evaluate 3,643 preterm or low birth weight infants who had received early (at 8 days of age) received rEpo or darbepoetin vs others treated with placebo. As anticipated, early rEpo treatment reduced the numbers of RBC transfusions and donor exposures. A subanalysis of 15 studies reporting 2,639 infants

showed that rEpo or darbepoetin administration reduced the rate of NEC (RR = 0.69, 95% CI [0.52-0.91]; p = 0.01; number needed to treat to benefit = 33). In another prospective (not double-blinded) randomized clinical trial of 1,285 infants, rEpo reduced the incidence of NEC (3% vs 5.4%, p = 0.027).50 The recent Preterm Erythropoietin Neuroprotection Trial (ett), a phase 3 RCT designed to assess the safety/efficacy of early high-dose rEpo for neuroprotection in 941 extremely preterm infants born at 24 weeks and 0 days to 27 weeks and 6 days of gestation, showed only a trend towards a decreased frequency of NEC in the rEpo group (RR = 0.87; 95% CI [0.60-1.27]; not significant).51
We were not able to find consistent clinical evidence to determine whether anemia and/or RBC transfusions could be clearly associated with NEC. In search of insights, we therefore also revisited other analogous conditions marked by severe anemia with a need for transfusion(s), and the risk of intestinal injury. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome or hemolytic disease of the newborn are known to trigger intestinal injury, particularly after RBC transfusion.52-54
The importance of severe anemia in intestinal injury also finds credence in the typically delayed occurrence of ta-NEC beyond four weeks of postnatal age, when anemia of prematurity is often concordant with nutritional deficiencies and inflammatory conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia.13 NEC-like bowel injury has also been seen in other populations of critically ill infants such as those receiving cardiopulmonary bypass or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, particularly when they receive top-up transfusions to treat severe anemia.55 These findings are consistent with at least two clinical studies that have noted the importance of anemia in risk-stratification for ta-NEC.12,21 The association between packed RBC transfusion and splanchnic perfusion after feeds has been studied to understand ta-NEC better, but in multivariate analysis no overall association was found between splanchnic fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) and fasting perfusion in a multivariate repeated-measures model that accounted for transfusion epochs (primary analysis approach). However, exploratory analyses of postprandial changes in FTOEs undertaken for each transfusion epoch separately showed increasing postprandial FTOEs with repeated transfusions.56,57
More generally, close examination of the literature shows important differences when the observational studies were compared with the meta-analyses of RCTs. The interest in ta-NEC, as judged by the number of publications/year, began to wane, and this was possibly related to the lack of new insights from associative clinical studies. However, a recent preclinical study in newborn mice has shed some novel mechanistic insights and showed that severe anemia, followed by RBC transfusions may cause intestinal injury. This has rekindled the ta-NEC controversy. In the following sections, we recapitulate the experimental findings from this study.

A Murine Model of Transfusion-associated NEC
Maheshwari's team developed a mouse model to evaluate the association between transfusions and NEC. They phlebotomized mouse pups on postnatal days 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 to induce severe anemia (hematocrit 20-24%), and transfused these anemic pups and

controls on postnatal day 11 with 20 mL/kg leukoreduced, packed (70%) RBCs that had been stored at 4캜 for 7 days, recapitulating current transfusion practices in neonates.58 Control pups remained unharmed. However, the anemic-transfused pups developed intestinal injury in the ileocecal and mid-colonic segments between 18 and 28 h after transfusion. The histopathological features in the affected intestine were characteristic of NEC.59,60 Consistently, animals with intestinal injury showed increased plasma levels of the gut epithelial injury marker fatty acid-binding protein 2,61 loss of intestinal barrier function,62 and developed a severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
Both anemic and the anemia-transfused mice showed monocyte/macrophage infiltration in the affected intestine.63 RBC transfusions contained free hemoglobin and heme,64 which activated the newly recruited monocytes and macrophages in the intestine by activating Tolllike receptor 4-mediated signaling, redox cycling,65 and downstream NF-B pathways.66 The role of Toll-like receptor 4 in NEC pathogenesis has been noted in other NEC models,67 and these seminal findings in ta-NEC highlighted the importance of these pathways as a unifying mechanism in NEC. The requirement of macrophages in ta-NEC was notable because the macrophage depletion prior to transfusions was protective. Blocking the NFB pathway in macrophages by administering specific inhibitory nanoparticles was also protective against ta-NEC.
The severity of anemia was important in murine ta-NEC. Mouse pups defined to have severe anemia (hematocrit 20-24%) developed more severe bowel injury as compared with those with moderate anemia (hematocrit 25-30%). The duration of anemia was also important; mice transfused on P10 (soon after the last phlebotomy) sustained less bowel damage than those transfused 24 hr later, on P11. If the transfused RBCs were leukoreduced, washed, and resuspended in saline prior to storage, the severity of ta-NEC was decreased. Pups that received multiple transfusions showed more severe injury. However, the duration of RBC storage (7 days vs 14 days) prior to transfusions did not change the severity of ta-NEC.

Discussion
A number of clinical studies suggests an association between RBC transfusions and NEC, although these findings have not been consistently proven in meta-analyses.4-26 In some premature infants, severe anemia may even be the predominant, possibly even sufficient, factor in the causation of NEC.12 However, the exact contribution of anemia and RBC transfusions to the development of bowel injury is not certain. In animal models, RBC transfusions can alter splanchnic autoregulation and cause at least transient intestinal ischemia.24,68 The murine model that we described above suggests that neither anemia nor RBC transfusions may be independently sufficient to cause NEC, but the risk may increase with a sequential exposure to these two factors. A dual-causation or possible multihit model may possibly explain the conflicting conclusions from many of the clinical studies and two of the meta-analyses.6,44 However, even though the experimental and laboratory findings in these animal studies are informative, there is a need for a cautious, refined approach to understand ta-NEC, thus using these findings only as a basis for designing confirmatory human studies.

There has been some difficulty in identifying the thresholds of low hemoglobin/hematocrit, at which the risk of NEC related to severe anemia may be higher than that related to corrective RBC transfusions.69-71 Four peer-reviewed national transfusion guidelines have been developed in Australia, Canada, and Europe (Fig. 1). These recommendations have found support from the broader scientific communities in neonatology, hematology, and transfusion medicine in their respective countries. In the United States, several single-center guidelines are in use that show some heterogeneity;13,48,72,73 this is highlighted in a post hoc analysis of data from the 19 participating sites in the preterm erythropoietin neuroprotection trial (PENUT).74 As discussed above, the adoption of clinical practices to minimize iatrogenic blood loss and possibly, (early) administration of rEpo/darbepoietin to prevent anemia, or other strategies to reduce the need for transfusions, is logical. However, further evidence is needed before firm recommendations can be made.75,76
Eventually, a range, not clear tipping points, of hematocrit/hemoglobin levels may have to be considered based on individual physiological and environmental factors. The impact of the duration of anemia on subsequent risk of NEC also needs investigation. A combination of a transfusion threshold plus another marker of end organ oxygen delivery or perfusion may help to define better when to or when not to transfuse. Given the multifaceted nature of the problem, we see a need to combine data from multiple centers across the world to inform well-designed clinical trials.
While we ponder on these questions, we need to ask ourselves whether we can do anything immediately to minimize the serious morbidities and mortality associated with transfusion and possibly with ta-NEC. The answer to this, from our perspective, is in the affirmative. Even though we acknowledge the disparity between the observational evidence and the randomized trials and would consider the latter to provide more reliable evidence, data from the rodent model of ta-NEC and the available observational studies have led us to come to the following considerations for the "best clinical practice" at the present time.

Expert Opinion
Current evidence favors minimizing the exposure of premature infants who may be at high risk of NEC, to prolonged periods of severe anemia. Four sets of national guidelines for RBC transfusions are currently available (Fig. 1),77-80 which show considerable differences. To understand the urgency of correcting anemia, we need further research to identify safe thresholds of hematocrit/hemoglobin.48 We should also continue to evaluate the potential benefits of rEpo and darbepoietin, at least in specific subsets (such as extremely low birth weight infants), if not in all at-risk infants. The exact thresholds of hematocrit/hemoglobin levels when RBC transfusions become necessary are still unclear. The animal models suggest that increased risk of NEC at hematocrit levels 24%,4 but some human studies suggest that organs such as the brain may be even less tolerant to anemia, with functional changes becoming evident at hematocrits 28%.81 RBC transfusion thresholds may have to be viewed as a range, not exact levels (Fig. 1), of hematocrit/hemoglobin based on the corrected gestational age, altitudes of residence, comorbidities, and the functional status of the microcirculation in various organ systems. Several interventions in a patient's

blood management are now possible to avoid severe anemia and to reduce the need for transfusions.
Thus, we conclude that only a minority of severely anemic premature infants develop ta-NEC.4 There is a need to identify the predisposing (genetic) and clinical factors that may increase the risk of ta-NEC. Considering the typically delayed onset of anemia of prematurity after birth, studies may need to focus on the identification of periods of increased vulnerability. Splanchnic vascular autoregulation deserves further evaluation. The availability of portable ultrasound machines may enhance the feasibility of such studies within the neonatal intensive care units.82 The association of ta-NEC with stimuli that increase intestinal oxygen consumption, such as feeding, need evaluation in high-risk infants.83 Murine and human studies have shown no harm in transfusions with RBCs stored for short periods,84 which is reassuring.85,86 However, further preclinical studies and models could be used to test potential interventions.84 We also do not believe irradiation to have a possible protective effect; current evidence suggests a pathophysiological role of macrophage-mediated innate, not lymphocyte-mediated adaptive immune response. The pathophysiological concept of anemia needs additional evaluation in premature infants.4 Fetal and adult hemoglobin have different oxygen carrying capacities. Therefore, low hematocrit levels in an infant who has previously received transfusions of RBC from adult donors may have different physiological implications than in a nontransfused infant.87 Thus, a detailed analysis infants recruited in the aforementioned clinical trials, who developed NEC/ta-NEC, would be of particular interest. The advantages and disadvantages of washing RBCs prior to storage or before transfusion needs study. Many studies suggest that washing may reduce the half-life of transfused RBCs.88 The findings in the murine model suggest that subtle hemolysis and extravasation of RBC contents may increase the risk of ta-NEC. The relationship between enteral feedings and ta-NEC needs more evaluation. Although the feeding during red cell transfusion (FEEDUR) trial, an open, multi-arm, parallel-group, single-center RCT did not show any difference in splanchnic oxygenation,89 the WHEAT (withholding enteral feeds around packed red cell transfusion) study90 may still yield important insights. Nutritional interventions, such as the use of pasteurized human donor milk as opposed to formula, enteral substitution of lactoferrin and/or L-arginine, and preventive application of multiple-strain probiotics deserve further investigation as strategies to reduce the rates of ta-NEC.30,91,92 Further study is needed to identify infants who might have ongoing subtle hemolysis either due to low-grade immune responses related to genetic defects or due to blood group incompatibility, as suggested by elevated reticulocyte counts and/or the presence of spherocytosis on peripheral blood smear.93 These infants may have anemia, activation of monocytes and macrophages, factors that have been found to be associated with ta-NEC. Effects of simultaneous transfusions with other blood products such as platelets, needs further evaluation as additional or synergistic risk factors for ta-NEC.94 In addition to larger, more definitive trials, some of the relevant questions in this domain may be amenable to scrutiny through use of big data and machine learning/AI.95-98

 Several retrospective studies have associated RBC transfusions with necrotizing enterocolitis (ta-NEC) in very preterm infants.
 Randomized controlled trials on transfusion thresholds and treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin or darbepoetin have not provided significant evidence for this association.
 A murine model of RBC transfusion-associated NEC-like pathology showed that sequential exposure to anemia followed by RBC transfusion is a risk factor for ta-NEC.
 Experimental and clinical data suggest that strategies of personalized blood management (including late cord clamping/milking and reduction of iatrogenic blood loss) in very preterm infants may help prevent ta-NEC.

Fig. 1: This graph summarizes current national guidelines (the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands as indicated by their flags) for RBC transfusions in VLBW infants with respect to age and the need of respiratory support (red dots). The wide variation in these recommendations highlights the need for further research to identify more definitive thresholds for transfusion. Blue dots indicate thresholds for infants without respiratory support. Recommended ranges or point thresholds of hemoglobin at which transfusions may be considered are shown. The year of publication is provided to visualize the trend towards more restrictive transfusion thresholds. Please note that we have not yet considered the impact of specific conditions such the type of blood sampling for measurement of hemoglobin values (vascular or capillary blood draws), precision of laboratory measurement, and the implications of physiological changes such as with altitude or the intravascular volume status

Abstract Aim: This study aimed to examine the sleep pattern of breast cancer survivors and anxiety and depression associated with sleep quality to provide evidence-based information for the development of interventions to improve sleep disorders in these survivors. Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: The subjects were 266 breast cancer survivors in South Korea. Structured questionnaires regarding sleep quality, anxiety and depression were used. The data were analysed using t test, ANOVA and multiple regression analysis. Results: Sleep duration and sleep disturbance were found to affect anxiety, whereas sleep latency and subjective sleep quality were found to affect depression. These results suggest that various factors affecting sleep quality should be considered when providing care for anxiety and depression in breast cancer survivors.

1|INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in South Korea, having increased by 4.7% every year from 2002-2017. The 5-year survival rate increased from 88.6% in 2001-2005%-93.2% in 2013-2017 (Ministry of Health and Welfare, Korea Central Cancer Registry, & National Cancer Center, 2019), and as the breast cancer survival rate increases, interest in the physical and emotional aspects of the quality of life of the survivors is also increasing.
Breast cancer patients are treated with surgery and radiation therapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted therapy, depending on the stage of the disease (American Cancer Society, 2019). Breast cancer survivors are those who survive cancer after the completion of treatment and include those women on longterm follow-up to reduce the risk of recurrence or secondary cancer and to improve health (American Society of Clinical Oncology, 2019). Breast cancer survivors suffer from late side effects, such as insomnia,

fatigue, arthralgia, tingling in the hands and feet and numbness, as well as emotional symptoms such as anxiety and depression (Palmer et al., 2016), and also experience a great deal of stress in adapting to changes in body image, environment and daily life during the treatment (American Society of Clinical Oncology, 2019). They want and need various interventions to help with these issues (Palmer et al., 2016).
Previous studies regarding sleep quality in breast cancer survivors have shown that they had shorter sleeping duration compared with normal women (Carpenter et al., 2004), experienced changes in sleep duration such as hypersomnia or shortening of sleep duration after chemotherapy (Park et al., 2009), experienced restless legs syndrome and symptoms related to parasomnia or sleep apnoea in addition to insomnia (Otte et al., 2016). These sleep disorders were found to be associated with decreased physical function and emotional states such as depressive symptoms and distress (Carpenter et al., 2004), while low sleep quality was found to be associated with

higher levels of anxiety and depression (Inhestern et al., 2017; Park et al., 2009).
Anxiety and depression were the most common problems experienced by breast cancer survivors (Palmer et al., 2016); prevalence rates among long-term breast cancer survivors are 17.9% and 11.6%, respectively (Mitchell et al., 2013). Breast cancer survivors were hardly able to accept the fact that they had cancer, even after the completion of treatment and were depressed and afraid of the possibility of metastasis or recurrence and not recovering quickly (Lee et al., 2013). Decreased levels of physical activity and various symptoms due to the side effects of treatment in breast cancer survivors may aggravate depression or have negative effects on their outlook on the future and their body image (Galiano-Castillo et al., 2014).
In breast cancer survivors, sleep disorder and anxiety or depression often do not occur separately, but rather co-occur simultaneously and interact with each other to reduce health-related quality of life (Fiorentino et al., 2011). Insomnia is one of the factors that causes depression, is a potential indicator of depression (Guo et al., 2006) and can impair immune or metabolic function in breast cancer survivors, negatively affecting quality of life or prognosis (Ban & Lee, 2013). Therefore, it is necessary that sleep quality be actively evaluated and managed. However, patients and caregivers tend to neglect sleep disturbance, as opposed to problems related to pain or treatment and often do not evaluate and treat sleep disturbances adequately (Mystakidou et al., 2007).
Recently, studies have investigated the relationship between physical and emotional symptoms and quality of life in breast cancer survivors (Lee et al., 2014; Park et al., 2009). There have also been studies investigating whether depression is a factor affecting sleep disorder (Carpenter et al., 2004) and identifying the relationship between anxiety and sleep disorder (Schreier et al., 2019). This study aimed to investigate the effects of sleep quality on anxiety or depression in breast cancer survivors and to provide evidence-based information for the development of interventions to improve sleep disorders in these survivors.
This study aimed to examine the sleep pattern of breast cancer survivors and anxiety and depression associated with sleep quality to provide evidence-based information for the development of interventions to improve sleep disorders in these survivors. Therefore, the purposes of this study were as follows: (a) to examine the levels of sleep quality, anxiety and depression of breast cancer survivors, and (b) to identify the association between sleep quality, anxiety and depression among Korean breast cancer survivors.
2|METHODS
2.1|Study design and participants
This was a descriptive study aimed at investigating the effects of sleep quality on anxiety and depression in breast cancer survivors, through the use of a questionnaire.

  | 1031
The subjects of this study were 266 breast cancer survivors aged 18 years or older who participated in breast cancer patient self-help groups at five tertiary hospital in South Korea and had completed postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy at least 6 months previously. Those who refused to participate in this study, had mental illness or had difficulty communicating were excluded. The number of subjects required for regression analysis in this study was calculated using the G*Power 3.1 program. When the number of predictive variables was 24, the significance level was 0.05, the power was 0.95, and the effect size was 0.15, and the number of subjects required was 238 (Faul et al., 2009). Questionnaires were distributed to 280 subjects (taking potential dropout rate into consideration); 266 subjects were finally selected for this study, excluding 14 subjects with incomplete information.
2.2|Study instruments
2.2.1|Sleep quality
Sleep quality was measured using questions about feeling refreshed when waking up in the morning, regular bedtimes and napping and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) developed by Buysse et al. (1989). The PSQI is a 4-point scale (0-3 points) consisting of 19 items with the seven subdomains of subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, hypnotics use and daytime dysfunction and the score ranges from 0-21 points. A higher score indicates lower sleep quality. Those with a global score of 5 or less are regarded as good sleepers and those with a score of 5 or over as poor sleepers. The reliability of the tool was a Cronbach  of 0.86 at the time of the development of the tool, and it was measured as 0.83 in this study.
2.2.2|Anxiety and depression
Anxiety and depression were measured by the Korean version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), originally developed by Zigmond and Snaith (1983). The HADS is a 14-item, 4-point scale (from 0 for none to 3 points for severe level), consisting of an anxiety scale (7 items, HADS-A) and depression scale (7 items, HADS-D); the score for each domain ranges from 0-21 points. A higher score indicates a higher level of anxiety or depression. A score of 7 points or lower for each domain was classified as having no symptoms, a score of 8-10 points was classified as mild anxiety or depression, and a score of 11 points or higher was classified as moderate anxiety or depression (evidence presented). The reliability of this tool was shown by a Cronbach  of 0.87 for depression and 0.82 for anxiety.

1032 | 
2.3|Data collection
Data were collected between March-July 2016. The subjects were recruited in breast cancer patient self-help groups meetings held at five tertiary hospitals. Questionnaire completion required approximately 20-30 min. Respondents received a small token of appreciation at follow-up visits. This was a self-reported survey completed by participants.
2.4|Ethics approvals
Ethics approvals were obtained from Human Research Ethics Committee (project no. KNU 2015-29) prior to study commencement. Informed consent to participate was obtained after the study contents, purposes and protocols, data confidentiality and anonymity procedures, and participants' freedom to discontinue the study had been explained.
2.5|Data analysis
Data were analysed using the SAS statistical program. The demographics and clinical characteristics of the subjects, sleep quality and levels of anxiety and depression were presented as frequency and percentage, mean and standard deviation. Differences in anxiety and depression according to the characteristics of the subjects were investigated using the t test and ANOVA, and the effects of sleep quality on anxiety or depression were investigated using multiple regression analysis.

3.1|Sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics of the participants
The mean age of the subjects was 52.9 years, with most (67.3%) aged 50 years or older; 83.5% had a spouse, and 78.2% had no job. In addition, 66.2% had a household income of more than KRW 2 million, 72.9% were high school graduates, 73.3% had a religion, and 60.2% had a body mass index of less than 23 kg/m2. In addition, 81.6% were postmenopausal women and 84.2% had stage II or below breast cancer. The mean time since operation was 70.8 months, and in 51.5%, less than 60 months had elapsed since surgery. The percentages of those who previously received postoperative chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone therapy were 83.4%, 54.1% and 48.9%, respectively, and the percentage of those who were currently receiving hormone therapy was 41.4% (Table 1).

3.3|Association between sleep quality, anxiety and depression

  | 1033

The results of regression models for anxiety and depression calculated using the sleep quality variable were all significant. Among the sleep quality factors, the explanatory power for anxiety was the highest for daytime dysfunction, followed by feeling refreshed when waking up in the morning, sleep duration and sleep disturbance. Of the sleep quality factors, the explanatory power for depression was highest for feeling refreshed when waking up in the morning, followed by daytime dysfunction, sleep latency and subjective sleep quality (Table 4).

4|DISCUSSION
This study examined sleep quality factors affecting anxiety and depression in breast cancer survivors, and the results showed that the total PSQI score in breast cancer survivors was 8.04 out of 21 points, and 72.2% were poor sleepers. These results indicate that the level of sleep quality found in this study (8.04 points) was lower than that in breast cancer survivors in the United States of America (USA) (7.33 points) (Carpenter et al., 2004) and that the proportion of poor sleepers in this study (72.2%) was higher than that in breast cancer survivors in the USA (53.0%). A previous study reported that hot flashes associated with menopause and the residual effects of cancer treatment were factors related to sleep disorder in breast cancer survivors (Carpenter et al., 2004; Otte et al., 2010). The percentage of postmenopausal women among the subjects of this study was 81.6%, which was higher than the 60.0% in the study by Carpenter et al. (2004), suggesting that sleep quality was lower.
In this study, 61.7% reported feeling refreshed when waking up in the morning, 30.5% reported having a regular bedtime, and 36.1% reported napping. Breast cancer survivors who received chemotherapy or radiotherapy do not sleep easily, due to residual effects related to cancer therapy or hot flashes, or they cannot get a good night's rest owing to being awake at night (Budhrani et al., 2015). Therefore, it is presumed that they do not experience feeling refreshed in the morning or that they supplement their insufficient sleep by napping.
The results of this study showed that the score for the level of anxiety in breast cancer survivors was 6.89 out of 21 points, and 15.0% had moderate anxiety, with a score of more than 11 points. This was lower than the level of anxiety (8.49 points) in female cancer patients and lower than the 30.9% who had moderate anxiety (Seok & Jun, 2016), while being similar to the level of anxiety (6.8 points) experienced by cancer survivors aged 25-55 years (Inhestern et al., 2017). A study by Akechi et al. (2015) found the proportion of those with moderate anxiety among breast cancer survivors to be 14.0%, which was like the results of this study.
Because breast cancer survivors often wake up at night, they feel less refreshed and they experience daytime somnolence and difficulties in daily life, due to reduced duration of sleep; they are worried about the possibility of breast cancer recurrence (Akechi

et al., 2015; Otte et al., 2010). In addition, they are anxious when experiencing sleep disorders, such as difficulty in falling asleep due to vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes or night sweats (Vincent et al., 2014). Such anxieties persist in symptoms and signs such as lack of energy, loss of interest, unhappy mood and depressed mood, and thus, anxiety and depression need to be managed together.
The results of this study found that sleep duration and sleep disturbance were factors affecting anxiety. This is in line with the results of a study revealing that insomnia in breast cancer survivors was associated with anxiety (Akechi et al., 2015). Because breast cancer survivors who have low satisfaction with sleep may be more anxious about the possible negative effects of sleep on their health, intervention programmes to improve sleep quality are needed.
In this study, the score for the level of depression in breast cancer survivors was 6.60 out of 21 points and 15.8% had moderate depression with more than 11 points, indicating that the level of depression was lower than that (9.20 points) in female cancer patients (Seok & Jun, 2016), the proportion of those with moderate depression was lower than that (35.1%) in female cancer patients (Seok & Jun, 2016), and the level of depression was higher than that (4.1 points) in cancer survivors aged 25-55 years (Inhestern et al., 2017).
This study showed that in breast cancer survivors, depression was high in those without a job compared with those with a job, like the results of a study by Inhestern et al. (2017). This is presumed to be because people with a job are more likely to have more social relations and physical activity than those without a job and become less depressed when they are able to identify their presence or value through their job, to mature and to live a thankful life (Bae & Kwon, 2016).

Previous studies have reported that physical activity or exercise intervention correlated between depression and fatigue in breast cancer survivors (Galiano-Castillo et al., 2014). Because the amount of physical activity was not investigated in this study, further studies are needed in this area in future In addition, one previous study reported that there was a relationship between fatigue and depression (Galiano-Castillo et al., 2014), but this study did not consider the degree of depression due to fatigue.
The results of this study showed that the levels of anxiety and depression were higher in those who had undergone their surgery less than 60 months (5 years) previously, than in those in whom more than 121 months (10 years) had elapsed since surgery. This was similar to the results of a study showing that levels of anxiety and depression were highest in breast cancer survivors with a duration since diagnosis of 2-4 years (Inhestern et al., 2017). Within 5 years after diagnosis, patients experience the sequelae of treatment and may develop cancer metastasis and recurrence; thus, the level of depression in these breast cancer survivors was high (Galiano-Castillo et al., 2014). This is thought to be because cancer patients are highly anxious about the possible recurrence of cancer (Akechi et al., 2015), while receiving regular screening after treatment and living as healthy people.
The results of this study showed that the levels of anxiety and depression were high in breast cancer survivors currently receiving hormone therapy, and the level of depression was high in those who previously received chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Cancerrelated therapies that breast cancer survivors were currently receiving were a risk factor for anxiety and depression (Beatty & Kissane, 2017). Breast cancer survivors are presumed to experience an increasing level of depression, as they encounter side effects such as early menopause and menopausal symptoms while undergoing surgery and adjuvant therapy (Palmer et al., 2016).

1036 | 
Therefore, it is necessary to provide interventions to relieve depression in breast cancer survivors who experience early menopause or menopausal symptoms. Further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between early menopause or menopausal symptoms and depression.
In this study, factors affecting depression were found to include sleep latency and subjective sleep quality. This finding was similar to the results of previous studies, where there were correlations between sleep latency and depression and between subjective sleep quality, sleep duration and depressive symptoms in breast cancer survivors (Budhrani et al., 2015; Carpenter et al., 2004). In addition, because cancer patients with sleep-arousal disorders frequently experience depression (Clark et al., 2004), it is presumed that depression and sleep disorders interact with each other. Therefore, further studies are needed to identify the causal relationship between depression and sleep quality (sleep latency and subjective sleep quality) in breast cancer survivors.
The results of this study showed that sleep quality factors commonly affecting anxiety and depression included daytime dysfunction and feeling refreshed when waking up in the morning. As cancer patients may experience difficulty in falling asleep (even after the end of treatment) or difficulty in maintaining sleep, they experience reduced sleep efficiency and symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness due waking up early, for several years (Roscoe et al., 2007).
The management of sleep quality is important for relieving anxiety and depression, because cancer patients who cannot do what they want due to low sleep quality become depressed and anxious, due to the fear that their sleep quality may have a negative impact on their health (Akechi et al., 2015; Clark et al., 2004).
Alfano et al. (2011) reported that 77.0% of breast cancer survivors were under- or over-sleeping 30 months after treatment. Such changes in sleep duration led to fatigue and lowered quality of life and sleeping disorders, and symptoms such as anxiety and depression are often accompanied by fatigue (Fiorentino et al., 2011). Therefore, sleep management is necessary to manage anxiety and depression in breast cancer survivors (Vincent et al., 2014) and it is imperative to develop programmes to improve sleep quality.
However, the results of this study are significant in that the sleep quality factors (daytime dysfunction and feeling refreshed when waking up in the morning, sleep duration, sleep disturbance, sleep latency and subjective sleep quality) were the major variables affecting anxiety and depression in breast cancer survivors.
4.1|Limitations
Firstly, the samples of this study were selected using convenience sampling from among breast cancer survivors who participated in breast cancer self-help groups, and it is difficult to generalize the results. Secondly, this study assessed that differences in sleep quality and anxiety and depression according to the use of combination therapy in breast cancer survivors were not investigated.

CHO and HWANG
Thirdly, this study did not analyse the difference between sleep quality, anxiety and depression according to the level of fatigue experienced by breast cancer survivors. Finally, since this study is a cross-sectional survey study using questionnaires, there is a limitation in not being able to identify the causal relationship between related variables.
5|CONCLUSION
In this study, we found that the factors commonly affecting anxiety and depression were daytime dysfunction and feeling refreshed when waking up in the morning. Sleep duration and sleep disturbance were found to affect anxiety, and sleep latency and subjective sleep quality were found to affect depression. These results suggest that various factors affecting sleep quality should be considered when providing nursing care for anxiety and depression in breast cancer survivors.
This author suggests conducting a follow-up study that identifies the effects of sleep quality, measured by quantitative tools such as polysomnography and hormone tests, on anxiety or depression. It is also necessary to conduct a longitudinal study that identifies changes in anxiety, depression or sleep disorders over the survival period.

Humanizing murine IgG3 anti-GD2 antibody m3F8 substantially improves antibody-dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxicity while retaining targeting in vivo

Murine IgG3 anti-GD2 antibody m3F8 has shown anti-neuroblastoma activity in Phase I/II studies, where antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) played a key role. Humanization of m3F8 should circumvent human antimouse antibody (HAMA) response and enhance its ADCC properties to reduce dosing and pain side effect. Chimeric 3F8
 2012 Landes Bioscience. (ch3F8) and humanized 3F8 (hu3F8-IgG1 and hu3F8-IgG4) were produced and purified by protein A affinity chromatography. In vitro comparison was made with m3F8 and other anti-GD2 antibodies in binding, cytotoxicity, and cross-reactivity assays. In GD2 binding studies by SPR, ch3F8 and hu3F8 maintained KD comparable to m3F8. Unlike other anti-GD2 antibodies, m3F8, ch3F8 and hu3F8 had substantially slower koff.. Similar to m3F8, both ch3F8 and hu3F8 inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro, while cross-reactivity with other gangliosides was comparable to that of m3F8. Both peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-ADCC and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN)-ADCC of ch3F8 and hu3F8Do not distribute. IgG1 were more potent than m3F8. This superiority was consistently observed in ADCC assays, irrespective of donors or NK-92MI-transfected human CD16 or CD32, whereas complement mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) was reduced. As expected, hu3F8-IgG4 had near absent PBMC-ADCC and CMC. Hu3F8 and m3F8 had similar tumor-to-non tumor ratios in biodistribution studies. Anti-tumor effect against neuroblastoma xenografts was better with hu3F8-IgG1 than m3F8. In conclusion, humanizing m3F8 produced next generation anti-GD2 antibodies with substantially more potent ADCC in vitro and anti-tumor activity in vivo. By leveraging ADCC over CMC, they may be clinically more effective, while minimizing pain and HAMA side effects. A Phase I trial using hu3F8-IgG1 is ongoing.

Introduction
Monoclonal antibody (MoAb) therapy is an accepted treatment modality for cancers, with five MoAb having received FDA approval for solid tumors in adults, including colorectal and breast cancer, non small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma.1,2 This modality, however, has remained inadequately exploited for the treatment of pediatric cancers. Unlike chemotherapy or radiation, MoAb is not myelosuppressive and genotoxic, generally with few long-term toxicities. These are critical considerations for young children. More importantly, MoAb is effective against metastatic cancer in blood, bone marrow and bone, typically found in high risk neuroblastoma (NB). As a class of agents, the pharmacokinetics and toxicities of human or humanized IgG1 antibodies have been extensively studied. In addition, antibodies can carry cytotoxic immune-based payloads, as well as radioisotopes, toxins or enzymes, thereby increasing the options for targeted therapy.

NB is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood. In ~50% of cases, curative strategies must tackle both soft tissue mass and metastases in the bone marrow (BM). Doseintensive chemotherapy improves tumor resectability and postsurgical irradiation reduces the risk of relapse in the primary site to , 10%.3 However, BM disease, as evidenced by histology or metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan, often persists and forebodes a lethal outcome.4,5 In addition, osteomedullary relapse is common, despite achieving near complete remission after induction therapy. Attempts at treatment intensification have met with acute and long-term side effects, both of grave concern for young patients. There is a scarcity of promising new agents, and to date, few if any target/pathway-specific small molecules have shown major clinical benefit in patients with NB, although many promising leads continue to accumulate.6 With a cure rate of , 30% at toxicity limits among Stage 4 patients diagnosed at $ 18 mo of age, there is substantial room for improvement.7

binding (kon, koff and KD) were compared by SPR using Biacore T-100. All engineered 3F8, including chimeric and humanized IgG1 and IgG4 had comparable koff as m3F8, and better KD than other anti-GD2 antibody such as 14.G2a (Fig. 1) and ME36.1 (Table 4). The slow koff of antibodies also translated into a slower wash-off when antibodies were reacted with GD2positive tumor cells LAN-1 or M14 and then washed multiple times in wash buffer. With each wash, the remaining antibodies on the cell surface were detected using a secondary FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody and mean fluorescent intensity determined by flow cytometry (data not shown).

Low cross-reactivity with other gangliosides. In crossreactivity studies, hu3F8-H1L1-IgG1 had similar profile as ch3F8-IgG1 and m3F8 (Table 5). There was low level of crossreactivity with GD1b expressed as percent OD by ELISA relative to the OD on solid phase GD2. There was no cross-reactivity of m3F8, hu3F8 or 14.G2a with human N-CAM,27 either by western blots or by SPR (data not shown).
Direct cytotoxicity. When these antibodies were added to neuroblastoma cells in vitro, they induced direct cell death and slowed down in vitro cell growth. Upon assayed by WST-8 in a 3-d culture system, m3F8 and hu3F8 had similar potency when their EC50s were compared (Table 6). In contrast, 14.G2a was ~10-fold weaker in tumor cell killing.
Antibody potency in ADCC and CMC. Anti-GD2 antibodies were compared in ADCC assays using PBMC and PMN from volunteers as effectors and LAN-1 cells as targets. ADCC potencies of these antibodies were computed as the ratio (EC50 for 3F8)/(EC50 for MoAb) (Table 7). Relative to m3F8, ch3F8IgG1 and hu3F8-IgG1 were ~300-fold stronger in PBMCADCC, and 18-fold stronger in PMN-ADCC. In addition, the maximal cytotoxicity achieved with both chimeric and humanized 3F8 of IgG1 subclass were substantially and consistently higher than that of m3F8 or 14.G2a, irrespective if it was PBMCADCC or PMN-ADCC.

MicroRNAs (miRs) have been demonstrated to be significantly associated with the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the underlying mechanism of miR-98 in mediating the malignant phenotypes of NSCLC cells remains obscure. In this study, we found that miR-98 was significantly downregulated in NSCLC tissues compared to nontumor lung tissues. Downregulation of miR-98 was significantly associated with poor differentiation and advanced clinical stage. Restoration of miR-98 expression significantly decreased the proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC A549 and H1229 cells. SALL4 was identified as a target gene of miR-98, and the protein expression of SALL4 was negatively regulated by miR-98 in NSCLC A549 and H1229 cells. Overexpression of SALL4 promoted A549 and H1229 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and reversed the suppressive effects of miR-98 on the malignant phenotypes of A549 and H1229 cells. Moreover, SALL4 was found to be significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues compared to the nontumor lung tissues. We then observed an inverse correlation between the miR-98 and SALL4 levels in NSCLC tissues. In vivo study revealed that miR-98 overexpression suppressed NSCLC growth. In summary, we demonstrate that miR-98 acts as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC cells by inhibiting the protein expression of its target gene SALL4. Therefore, our study highlights the importance of the miR-98/SALL4 axis in NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85% of all lung cancers, and the most common NSCLCs are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and nonsquamous cell carcinoma1,2. Although great improvements have been made in surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the overall survival of patients with late-stage NSCLC remains unsatisfactory3,4. Studies in recent years have identified some important oncogenes and tumor suppressors involved in NSCLC growth and metastasis, suggesting that they may become promising therapeutic targets5,6. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of NSCLC should be beneficial in the development of effective therapeutic strategies for this disease.
MicroRNAs (miRs), a kind of small, noncoding RNA molecules of 20-25 nucleotides in length, can inhibit gene expression at the posttranscriptional level through binding to the 3-untranslated region (UTR) of their target genes, resulting in mRNA degradation or translation

inhibition7. miRs have been found to participate in many biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, apoptosis, and motility8,9. Moreover, deregulation of miRs has been observed in NSCLC, and many of them function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, such as miR-9, miR-21, miR-145, miR-367, and so forth10-14. These miRs may become promising therapeutic targets or candidates for the treatment of NSCLC.
miR-98, an important member of the let-7/miR-98 family, has been reported to be involved in many pathological processes such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and tumorigenesis15-17. Wang et al. found that miR-98 suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting CTHRC118. Du et al. found that miR-98 could inhibit the growth and metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma by suppressing the protein expression of IGF1R19. In addition, miR-98 can inhibit the metastasis of melanoma through a negative feedback loop with its target gene IL-620. Recently, miR-98 was found to inhibit the malignant phenotypes of NSCLC cells through directly targeting ITGB3 and

PAK121,22. As one miR has many target genes7, whether other targets of miR-98 exist in NSCLC still needs to be fully investigated.
Our study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of miR-98 expression in NSCLC, as well as the underlying mechanism of miR-98 in mediating the proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue Sample Collection
The study was approved by the ethics committee of Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, P.R. China. NSCLC tissues (n=88) and nontumor lung tissues (n=15) were collected at our hospital from January 2010 to March 2011. All written informed consents were obtained. The tissues were confirmed by pathologists at our hospital. NSCLC patients did not receive preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy. After surgical resection, all tissues were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80캜. The clinicopathological information is summarized in Table 1.
Real-Time qPCR Assay
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher) was used to convert RNA into cDNA

For miR-98 expression detection, MiRNA Q-PCR Detection Kit (GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD, USA) was used to conduct real-time PCR on the ABI 7300 plus thermocycler. U6 gene was used as an internal reference. For mRNA detection, the Q-PCR Detection Kit (Thermo Fisher) was used to conduct real-time PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions. GAPDH was used as an internal reference. The PCR conditions were 95캜 for 5 min, and 40 cycles of 95캜 for 15 s and 60캜 for 30 s. The relative expression of miR and mRNA was analyzed using the 2-DDCt method.
Cell Culture and Transfection
Normal lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B and human NSCLC cell lines A549, HCC827, H1229, and SKMES-1 were purchased from the Cell Bank of Central South University (Hunan Sheng, P.R. China). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were cultured at 37캜 in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells were passaged every 3 days to maintain exponential growth. A549 and H1229 cells were transfected with miR-98 mimic, scramble miR mimic (miR-NC), miR-98 inhibitor, negative control (NC) inhibitor, pcDNA3.1-SALL4 expression plasmid, or blank

miR-98 INHIBITS NSCLC VIA TARGETING SALL4
pcDNA3.1 vector using Lipofectime 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Western Blot
Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer to extract proteins, which were separated with 12% SDS-PAGE, and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The membrane was incubated with PBS containing 5% milk at room temperature for 3 h. The PVDF membrane was incubated with primary antibodies including SALL4, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, fibronectin, vimentin, MMP2, MMP9, and GAPDH (all from Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) at room temperature for 3 h, and then with secondary antibody (Abcam) at room temperature for 1 h. SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) was then used to detect signals according to the manufacturer's instructions. The relative protein expression was analyzed by Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA), represented as the density ratio versus GAPDH.
MTT Assay
Cells were plated at a density of 10,000 cells per well in 96-well plates. After being cultured for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h, cells were incubated with MTT (0.5 mg/ml) for 4 h at 37캜. Then 150 mM DMSO solution was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance was read at 570 nm using a microplate reader.
Wound Healing Assay
Cells were cultured to full confluence, and wounds of approximately 1-mm width were created with a plastic scriber. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated in DMEM without FBS. After wounding for 24 h, cells were incubated in DMEM with 10% FBS. After being cultured for 48 h, cells were observed under a microscope.
Transwell Assay
Transwell chambers precoated with Matrigel (BD Bio sciences, San Jose, CA, USA) were used to perform the Transwell assay. Cell suspension containing 5105 cells/ ml was prepared in DMEM, 300 l of which was added into the upper chamber. Then 500 l of DMEM with 10% FBS was added into the lower chamber. After cells were incubated at 37캜 for 24 h, a cotton-tipped swab was used to wipe out the cells that did not pass through the pores. Cells were fixed in 90% alcohol, stained with crystal violet, and observed under a microscope.
Bioinformatics Analysis and Luciferase Reporter Assay
TargetScan, miRanda, and PicTar bioinformatics soft ware was used to predict the putative target genes of miR-98 according to the manufacturer's instructions.

977
The wild type (WT) or mutant type (MT) of SALL4 3-UTR was cloned into the downstream of the firefly luciferase coding region of pMIR-GLOTM luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). A549 and H1229 cells were cotransfected with 200 ng of WT- or MT- SALL4-3줦TR plasmid, and 100 ng of the miR-98 mimic or miR-NC and the pRL-TK plasmid (Promega) for internal normalization. After transfection for 36 h, the luciferase activity was examined using the DualLuciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufac춗urer's instructions.
Stable Transfection and Tumor Growth Analysis
Male BALB/C-nu/nu nude mice (8 weeks) were pur chased and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Animal Center of Central South University (Hunan Sheng, P.R. China). The mature miR-98 or SALL4 was cloned into the pLP/VSVG lentiviral vector. A549 cells were stably transfected with the pLP/VSVG-miR-98 plasmid, pLP/VSVG-SALL4 plasmid, or blank vector. Nude mice were injected subcutaneously in the dorsal flank with 1107 A549 cells of each group. Nude mice were sacrificed 90 days after tumor implantation. Tumor weight was determined. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula V (mm3)=0.5큑큒2 (a is the maximum length to diameter, and b is the maximum trans verse diameter).
Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as mean켚D from at least three separate experiments. Independent t-tests were used to compare the differences between two groups. Qualitative data were analyzed by the chi-square test. Correlation was determined by Pearson correlation analysis. SPSS 20.0 was used to perform statistical analysis. A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Downregulation of miR-98 Is Associated With Malignant Progression in NSCLC
In this study, we first used real-time RT-PCR to determine the miR-98 expression level in NSCLC tissues (n=88). Nontumor lung tissues (n=15) were used as controls. We found that miR-98 was significantly downregulated in NSCLC tissues compared to nontumor lung tissues (Fig. 1A). To further confirm these findings, we examined the miR-98 expression in normal lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B and human NSCLC cell lines including A549, HCC827, H1229, and SKMES-1. Expression levels of miR-98 were also reduced in NSCLC cell lines compared to BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 1B). Therefore, miR-98 is downregulated in NSCLC. We then studied the clinical significance of miR-98 expression in NSCLC. Based on the mean value of the miR-98 expression as

the cutoff point, NSCLC patients were divided into two groups: low miR-98 expression group and high miR-98 expression group. We found that low miR-98 expression was significantly associated with poor differentiation and advanced clinical stage, but not with age, sex, hypotype, tumor size, or smoking status (Table 1). Therefore, we suggest that decreased expression of miR-98 is associated with the malignant progression of NSCLC.
miR-98 Has Suppressive Effects on NSCLC Cell Growth and Metastasis In Vitro
A549 and H1229 were further used to study the regulatory role of miR-98 in NSCLC in vitro. As we had found that miR-98 was downregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, A549 and H1229 cells were transfected with the miR-98 mimic to increase its expression. Transfection with miR-NC was used as the control group. Real-time PCR data indicated that miR-98 levels were significantly higher in the miR-98 group than in the miR-NC group (Fig. 2A and B). Further investigation showed that overexpression of miR-98 caused a significant reduction in cell proliferation (Fig. 2C and D). These findings suggest that miR-98 has a suppressive effect on NSCLC growth.
We further studied the regulatory role of miR-98 in NSCLC metastasis in vitro by performing wound healing and Transwell assays. The migration and invasion capacities of A549 and H1229 cells were significantly decreased after overexpression of miR-98 when compared to the miR-NC group (Fig. 3A-D). MMP2 and MMP9 are two important matrix metalloproteinases, which play a key role in tumor cell migration and invasion. Therefore, we examined the protein expression in each group. Western blot data showed that the protein levels of MMP2 and

MMP9 were significantly lower in the miR-98 group when compared with those in the miR-NC group (Fig. 3E and F). Based on the above data, we demonstrated that miR-98 has a suppressive effect on NSCLC cell growth and metastasis in vitro.
SALL4 Is a Target Gene of miR-98 in NSCLC Cells
We then used several common bioinformatics software to predict the putative target genes of miR-98. We found that SALL4 was a potential target gene of miR-98, with perfect base pairing at the seed sequences of miR-98 (data not shown). To confirm these find ings, the WT- and MT-SALL4-3줦TR luciferase reporter plasmids were generated (Fig. 4A). Luciferase reporter assay data indicated that cotransfection with the miR-98 mimic and WT-SALL4-3줦TR luciferase reporter plasmid led to a significant decrease in the luciferase activity in A549 and H1229 cells when compared to the control group, which was eliminated by cotransfection with the MT-SALL4-3줦TR luciferase reporter plasmid (Fig. 4B and C). Accordingly, SALL4 is a target gene of miR-98.
We further showed that overexpression of miR-98 significantly reduced the protein expression of SALL4 in NSCLC cells (Fig. 5A and B). To confirm these findings, A549 and H1229 cells were transfected with the miR-98 inhibitor to further downregulate its expression. After transfection, miR-98 levels were reduced in the miR-98 inhibitor group when compared with those in the NC inhibitor group (Fig. 5C and D). We then found that knockdown of miR-98 upregulated the protein expression of SALL4 in NSCLC cells (Fig. 5E and F). Therefore, miR-98 negatively regulates the protein expression of SALL4 in NSCLC cells.

SALL4 Is Upregulated in NSCLC and Reverse Correlated With miR-98 Levels
The expression level of SALL4 was further determined in NSCLC. We found that the mRNA levels of SALL4 were significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues compared to nontumor lung tissues (Fig. 6A). Moreover, an inverse correlation was observed between the miR-98 and SALL4 mRNA levels in NSCLC tissues (Fig. 6B), which suggests that upregulation of SALL4 may be caused by the decreased expression of miR-98 in NSCLC. In addition, we further examined the expression of SALL4 in NSCLC cell lines and normal lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells. We found that the protein levels of SALL4 were significantly increased in NSCLC cell lines compared to BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 6C).
SALL4 Is Involved in the miR-98-Mediated Growth and Metastasis of NSCLC Cells
As we found that SALL4, upregulated in NSCLC, was negatively mediated by miR-98, we then studied whether

SALL4 was involved in the miR-98-mediated growth and metastasis of NSCLC cells. miR-98-overexpressing A549 and H1229 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1SALL4 expression plasmid. The protein levels of SALL4 were significantly higher in the miR-98+SALL4 group when compared with those in the miR-98 group (Fig. 7A and B). MTT assay data further indicated that cell proliferation capacity was increased in the miR-98+SALL4 group compared to the miR-98 group (Fig. 7C and D), suggesting that the suppressive effect of miR-98 on NSCLC cell proliferation is through inhibition of SALL4. Afterward, we found that the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells were also significantly upregulated in the miR-98+SALL4 group when compared to the miR-98 group (Fig. 8A-D). Taken together, over expression of SALL4 eliminated the suppressive effects of miR-98 on the malignant phenotypes of A549 and H1229 cells. Therefore, SALL4 acts as a downstream effector in the miR-98-mediated growth and metastasis of NSCLC cells.

(B, C) The luciferase activity was notably decreased in A549 and H1229 cells cotransfected with miR-98 mimics and WT-SALL4-3줦TR reporter plasmid, but unaltered in A549 and H1229 cells cotransfected with miR-98 mimics and MT-SALL4-3줦TR plasmid. **p<0.01 versus miR-NC.

Effects of miR-98 and SALL4 on NSCLC Growth In Vivo
We then studied the effects of miR-98 and SALL4 on NSCLC growth in vivo. miR-98 or SALL4 was cloned into the pLP/VSVG lentiviral vector. The pLP/VSVGmiR-98 or pLP/VSVG-SALL4 plasmid was then stably transfected into A549 cells. After transfection, miR-98 and SALL4 expression was significantly increased when compared to the control group that was transfected with a blank vector (Fig. 9A and B). Afterward, nude mice were subcutaneously implanted with A549 cells of each group, and the tumor grew gradually after implantation. The mice were sacrificed on the 90th day after implantation. We found that SALL4 overexpression remarkably promoted tumor growth, while overexpression of miR-98 significantly suppressed tumor growth when compared to the control group (Fig. 9C). Tumor weight and volume were increased in the SALL4 group, but decreased in the miR-98 group when compared to the control group (Fig. 9D and E). These findings further suggest that miR-98 inhibits NSCLC growth in vivo, at least, via directly targeting SALL4.

DISCUSSION
A variety of miRs have been demonstrated to participate in the development and malignant progression of NSCLC11,23, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. Here we reported that miR-98 was signif icantly downregulated in NSCLC, which was associated with disease progression. Further investigation revealed that miR-98 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells in vitro, as well as tumor growth in vivo, at least partly, via directly targeting SALL4, an oncogene upregulated in NSCLC.
miR-98 has been demonstrated to act as a tumor suppressor or oncogene in different human cancers19,20,24. It is downregulated and plays a suppressive role in glioma24, oral squamous cell carcinoma19, and melanoma20. On the contrary, it is upregulated and functions as an oncogene in gastric cancer25, colon cancer26, and small cell lung cancer27. The dual roles of miR-98 are probably due to the fact that it functions through targeting different genes in different cancers. Recently, miR-98 was reported to be significantly downregulated in NSCLC and plays a

suppressive role21,22. Ni et al. found that miR-98 targeted ITGB3 to inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells21. Yang et al. showed that miR-98 inhibited cell proliferation and invasion of non-small cell carcinoma lung cancer by targeting PAK122. Moreover, overexpression of miR-98 could increase A549 cell spontaneous apoptosis and sensitize cells to cisplatin, at least partly, by upregulation of HMGA228. In addition, upregulation of miR-98 in the serum of NSCLC patients is associated with better outcomes of radiotherapy29. Our study showed that miR-98 was significantly downregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines when compared with that in nontumor lung tissues or normal lung epithelial cells. We further showed that low expression of miR-98 was significantly associated with poor differentiation and advanced clinical stage in NSCLC, suggesting that downregulation

of miR-98 may contribute to the malignant progression of NSCLC. NSCLC A549 and H1229 cell lines were further used to investigate the regulatory mechanism of miR-98 in NSCLC growth and metastasis. We found that overexpression of miR-98 significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of A549 and H1229 cells, which suggests that miR-98 has an inhibitory effect on NSCLC growth and metastasis.
SALL4, a zinc finger transcription factor, is an important stem cell marker participating in the maintenance of self-renewal of embryonic stem cells30. Recently, SALL4 has been identified as an oncogene in some common cancer types31,32. Yong et al. reported that SALL4 was reexpressed in a subgroup of patients who have hepatocellular carcinoma and an unfavorable prognosis33. Yue et al. showed that high expression of SALL4 predicted a

In addition, SALL4 was found to be an oncogene in glioma35, endometrial cancer36, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma37, colon cancer38, ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma39, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma40. Recently, Rodriguez et al. reported that a high expression of SALL4 was correlated with low differentiation of NSCLC41. Kobayashi et al. found that SALL4 was upregulated in lung cancer and played a promoting role in cell proliferation42. Moreover, SALL4 was identified as a drug-resistant factor in lung cancer, and high expression of SALL4 is associated with shorter

period until recurrence43. Therefore, SALL4 may become a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC.
In addition, several miRs directly target SALL4 and function as tumor suppressors in different cancers. Cheng et al. found that miR-219 inhibited the proliferation, mig ration, and invasion of colon cancer cells by targeting SALL438. Lin et al. reported that miR-33b suppressed breast cancer metastasis through inhibition of HMGA2, SALL4, and Twist1 expression44. However, the miR-related regulatory mechanism of SALL4 expression in NSCLC has never previously been studied. In the present study, we showed that SALL4, significantly upregulated in NSCLC,

was a novel target of miR-98, and the protein expression of SALL4 was negatively regulated by miR-98 in NSCLC cells. Moreover, overexpression of SALL4 eliminated the suppressive effects of miR-98 on the growth and metastasis of NSCLC cells in vitro. These findings

suggest that the suppressive role of miR-98 in NSCLC is through directly targeting SALL4. In vivo study further supports our conclusion that overexpression of miR-98 reduced the tumor growth of A549 cells, while upregulation of SALL4 promoted NSCLC growth in nude mice.

Figure 9. Effects of miR-98 and SALL4 on NSCLC growth in vivo. A549 cells were stably transfected with the blank pLP/VSVG vector as control, pLP/VSVG-miR-98 lentiviral plasmid, or pLP/VSVG-SALL4 lentiviral plasmid. (A) Real-time qPCR was conducted to examine the miR-98 levels. (B) Western blot was used to examine the protein levels of SALL4. Nude mice were subcutaneously implanted with the above cells. (C) On 90 days after implantation, the nude mice in each group were sacrificed, and the xenograft was obtained. (D) Tumor weight and (E) tumor volume were calculated. **p<0.01 versus Control.

To our knowledge, the present study showed that miR-98 acts as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC through directly targeting SALL4 for the first time. Therefore, we suggest that miR-98 and SALL4 may be promising therapeutic candidates and targets for NSCLC.

Background: The dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been linked with male infertility. miR-509-5p is highly expressed in testis and exerts suppressive effects on multiple types of human cancers. Objectives: Yet, whether miR-509-5p is connected with male infertility and plays a role in testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) have not been explored. Materials and methods: This study detected miR-509-5p expression in germ cells from MA patients, and further characterize its functional roles in the proliferation and apoptosis of TGCT cells in vitro. Results: We report that miR-509-5p is downregulated in germ cells from infertile men with maturation arrest (MA), which implies an inverse association between miR-509-5p level and male infertility. In addition, miR-509-5p suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis of TGCT cells in vitro, suggesting that it exhibits tumor-suppressive effects on TGCT. Mechanistically, miR-509-5p targets the mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), an oncogenic factor in TGCT, and moreover, restored expression of MDM2 rescues miR-509-5p suppressive effects on TGCT cells, demonstrating that miR-509-5p suppresses TGCT cells through targeting MDM2. Conclusion: Collectively, these results implicate that miR-509-5p may participate in the pathogenesis of male infertility and TGCT through regulating proliferation and apoptosis, two critical cellular activities for spermatogenesis and TGCT tumorigenesis. Keywords: male infertility, testicular germ cell tumor, miR-509-5p, proliferation, apoptosis, MDM2

Introduction
Infertility is a common reproductive problem, and it has been estimated that 60-80 million couples are currently suffering from it, accounting for 10-15% couples worldwide.1 Among them, approximately 50% of cases are caused by male factors,
with most of which diagnosed to be idiopathic, although the underlying etiological mechanisms of male infertility disorder are still far from clear.2 The nonobstructive
azoospermia (NOA) is characterized by the absence of sperm resulting from abnormal progression of spermatogenesis, and represents 10-20% of male infertility and remains the most challenging infertility to treat.3 Particularly, maturation arrest (MA) is a
common histopathological subtype of NOA and leads to severe male infertility and limited pregnancy rate.4 Until now, the comprehensive investigations on MA are still

scarce and the causative factors leading to it are very obscure. To improve the clinical outcome of MA, its physiopathology needs to be elucidated at a molecular level for pursuing the therapeutic targets.
Spermatogenesis is an elaborated multistep programme dictating the differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells into spermatozoa throughout the reproductive period of adult males.5 Spermatogenesis consists of stages of mitotic proliferating spermatogonia, meiotic spermatocytes, and haploid-differentiated spermatids, and a dynamic balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis is required for maintaining the number of spermatozoa.6 Accordingly, abnormally increased apoptosis of spermatozoa and decreased mitotic activity of spermatogonia have been linked with male infertility.7-9 The dysregulated apoptosis and proliferation also contribute to the pathogenesis of testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT), which represent the leading malignancies in 15- to -35-year-old males.10,11
In addition, spermatogenesis process is orchestrated by a complicated network of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.12 In recent years, the microRNAs (miRNAs)-regulated gene expression has emerged to be important factor for spermatogenesis and male infertility.13,14 miRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs regulating the targeted mRNA molecules through binding with the 3-untranslated region (3-UTR) sequence.15 The abnormal expression of some miRNAs is present in male infertility, which holds the potential to serve as molecular biomarkers for disease diagnosis, such as miR-34c-5p, miR-122, miR-I9b, and let-7a.16 In fact, miRNAs control every step of spermatogenesis.14 For instance, the depletion of male germ cell-specific Dicer1, an enzyme producing miRNAs,17 causes infertility as a result of meiotic and spermiogenic defects.18 Although a few specific miRNAs, such as miR-38319 and miR-320a,20 have been associated with male infertility, our understanding of the role of miRNAs in male infertility is still very limited.
Previous studies have shown that miR-509-5p exerts tumor-suppressive effects on various cancers, including renal cell carcinoma,21 pancreatic cancer cells,22 and breast cancer.23 Besides, miR-509-5p displays high expression level in testis.24 Whereas whether miR-509-5p has a possible connection with male infertility and plays a role in TGCT remain unclear. This study aimed to detect miR-509-5p expression in germ cells from MA patients, and further characterize its functional roles in the proliferation and apoptosis of TGCT cells in vitro.

Materials And Methods Testicular Tissues
Testicular tissues were collected from infertile male patients with maturation arrest (MA) (aged 22-38 years, n = 12) and normal individuals (aged 23-35, n = 8) who underwent orchiectomy for prostate carcinoma at the Linyi Central Hospital. The diagnosis for MA was based on a standard pathological criteria, in which spermatogenic defects were confirmed by sertoli-cell-only syndrome and spermatogenic arrest appearing in spermatogonia or primary spermatocytes. On the other hand, histological examination confirmed the normal spermatogenesis in control individuals, who had no medical history of infertility. The patient consent was written informed consent, and it was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Linyi Central Hospital.
Cell Culture And Transfection
Cell lines of NT2, NCCIT, and HEK293T were obtained from the American type culture collection (ATCC). The morphology was periodically confirmed and the short tandem repeat (STR) profiling method was used to authenticate cell lines. NT2 and HEK293T cell lines were cultured in DMEM medium and NCCIT cell line was cultured in RPMI1640 medium added with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies) at 37캜 with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells passaged for 3-7 times were used for experiments. The transfection of control mimic, miR-509-5p mimic, control inhibitor or miR-509-5p inhibitor (Genepharma, Shanghai, China), pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) or pcDNA3.1-MDM2 was conducted using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocols. The transfection efficiency was confirmed by measuring mRNA level or protein level of targets following 2 days of transfection.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR Analysis
RNAs were isolated from the testicular tissues and TGCT cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified RNAs were synthesized into complimentary cDNAs by using PrimeScript RT reagent kit (TaKaRa). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out with StepOne real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) and SYBR Premix Ex Taq II Kit (Takara). -actin served to be an internal control. For the analysis of miR-509-5p, small RNAs were isolated by mirPremier miRNA isolation kit (Sigma-Aldrich). miR-5095p expression was measured by TaqMan miRNA assays

(Applied Biosystems). U6 snRNA served to be a normalization. The sequences of gene-specific primer pairs are available when request.
Western Blotting Analysis
Protein samples were isolated from the testicular tissues and TGCT cells using RIPA buffer (Beyotime, P0013B) containing the protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Then, protein samples were resoluted by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were sequentially probed with primary and secondary antibodies. Blots were visualized by Enhanced Chemiluminescence System (Amersham Biosciences), and quantified using the ImageJ software. Antibody sources are listed as below: cleaved caspase 3 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, 9661), MDM2 (1:500, Abcam, ab16895), actin (1:2000, Proteintech, 66009-1-Ig), goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000, Novus, NB730-H) and goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5000, Novus, NBP2-30347H).
Cell Proliferation And Apoptosis
Cell proliferation of TGCT cells was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 kit (Beyotime, C0038). Each condition was allocated five parallel wells. The absorbance at 450 nm was recorded by Epoch 2 Microplate Spectrophotometer (Biotek Instruments). Apoptosis was determined using Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BioLegend, 640914) and following flow cytometry analysis with FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Apoptotic cells were defined as Annexin V positive cells. Data were analyzed by FlowJo (Tree Star).
Luciferase Reporter Assay
HEK293T cells were cotransfected 100 nM control mimic or 100 nM miR-509-5p mimic, or 100 nM control inhibitor or miR-509-5p inhibitor with 2 킽 dual luciferase reporter pGL3-basic plasmids (Promega) containing either wild-type or mutant MDM2 3-UTR of MDM2 using Lipofectamine 2000. The mutation of binding sites was introduced using the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The simultaneous transfection of 20 ng Renilla vector was used as a transfection control. At 36 h after transfection, luciferase activity was assessed by Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). The Renilla luciferase activity served as a normalization.

Statistical Analysis
Data are shown as the mean  SD. The differences between two sets of data were assessed by one-way ANOVA test, while the correlation was evaluated using Pearson's correlation analysis. Comparisons were considered to be statistically significant if P values are less than 0.05.
Results miR-509-5p Is Downregulated And Negatively Associated With Proliferation In Germ Cells From Infertile Men With Maturation Arrest
To test whether miR-509-5p is associated with male infertility, we first measured its expression level in testicular biopsy specimens collected from normal controls (NC, n = 8) and men with maturation arrest (MA, n = 12). qRT-PCR analysis showed that compared with NC specimens, miR-509-5p expression was markedly decreased in MA patients (Figure 1A, P = 0.0183). It has been demonstrated that the expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an indicator of proliferating activity in testes, was elevated in tubules of MA patients than those with focal spermatogenesis,25 and that PCNA expression was also upregulated in germ cells from MA patients compared with normal controls.19 Consistently, we also noticed that PCNA expression significantly increased in testicular biopsy specimens from MA patients relative to NC, as shown by qRT-PCR analysis (Figure 1B, P = 0.0256). To check whether miR509-5p has a correlation with germ cell proliferation, the expression levels of miR-509-5p and PCNA in NC and MA groups were pooled together, and analyzed by the Pearson's correlation analysis. As a result, a strong reverse correlation was observed between miR-509-5p and PCNA levels in testicular samples (Figure 1C, r = -0.7139, P = 0.0004). Altogether, these observations reveal a downregulated miR509-5p expression in testicular samples from MA patients, which is accompanied by increased proliferating activity.
miR-509-5p Retards Proliferation And Induces Apoptosis Of Testicular Germ Cell Tumor Cells
Until now, the function of miR-509-5p has been largely connected with numerous suppressive effects on malignant properties of human cancers, including proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion.21,22,26 To provide a useful clue on how miR-509-5p may participate in regulating germ cell

(A-B) miR-509-5p level (A) and PCNA level (B) in the testes of normal controls (NC, n = 8) and infertile men with maturation arrest (MA, n = 12) were determined by qRT-PCR analysis.

proliferation and other processes, we next evaluated its functional roles using two cell lines of testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT), NT-2 and NCCIT, cultured in vitro. To our knowledge, whether miR-509-5p affects the proliferation and apoptosis of TGCT cells has not been characterized. Through

transfecting the synthetic miR-509-5p mimic into NT-2 and NCCIT cells (Figure 2A), we found that miR-509-5p overexpression led to a remarkable suppression in cell proliferation rate, as determined by cell proliferation assay CCK-8 (Figure 2B). Moreover, the analysis of annexin V/PI double

staining showed that miR-509-5p overexpression also induced apoptosis in both NT-2 and NCCIT cells (Figure 2C). This finding was further strengthened by increased level of cleaved caspase-3 in miR-509-5p-overexpressing cells (Figure 2D). To confirm these effects of miR-509-5p, we inhibited miR-5095p via transfecting the antisense oligonucleotides (Figure 2E). In concert with results obtained by miR-509-5p overexpression, its inhibition markedly resulted in increased cell proliferation (Figure 2F) and decreased apoptosis (Figure 2G-H) in NT-2 and NCCIT cells. Hence, these findings indicate that miR-509-5p functions to suppress cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in TGCT cells, at least in vitro. Further, given its downregulation and the reverse correlation with proliferating activity in testicular samples from MA patients, we suppose that miR-509-5p may be functionally involved in male infertility pathogenesis through regulating germ cell proliferation and apoptosis.

To understand how miR-509-5p elicits tumor-suppressive effects on TGCT cells, the tool of TargetScan algorithm was applied to predict the binding targets.27 Among these potential targets, we focused on the mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) (Figure 3A, upper panel), a well-defined oncogene,28 since it plays a critical role in modulating the proliferation and apoptosis of TGCT cells.29 We initially validated the direct target of MDM2 by miR-509-5p using the luciferase reporter assay, as shown by miR-509-5p-suppressed luciferase activity of reporter construct containing the wild-type 3-UTR MDM2, but not the mutant one (Figure 3A, bottom panel). Consistently, miR509-5p overexpression reduced and its inhibition increased the mRNA (Figure 3B and C) and protein (Figure 3D) levels of MDM2 in NT-2 and NCCIT cells, therefore proving that miR509-5p targets and suppresses MDM2 expression in TGCT cells. Furthermore, we wondered whether MDM2 expression

Figure 3 miR-509-5p targets MDM2. (A, upper panel) The putative binding sites for miR-509-5p in MDM2 3-UTR was predicted by TargetScan algorithms. (A, bottom panel) NC mimic or miR-509-5p mimic was cotransfected with luciferase reporter construct with either wild-type (wt-MDM2) or mutant MDM2 3-UTR (mut-MDM2) into HEK293 cells. The luciferase activity assayed at 36 h after transfection (n = 5). (B-D) NT2 and NCCIT were transfected with NC mimic or miR-509-5p mimic, or NC inhibitor or miR-509-5p inhibitor.

(E-F) The mRNA level (E) and protein level (F) of MDM2 in the testes of normal controls (NC, n = 8) and infertile men with maturation arrest (MA, n = 12) were determined.

is also reversely correlated with miR-509-5p in testicular samples from MA patients. Indeed, by analyzing the same testicular samples, we discovered that just contrary to miR509-5p downregulation (Figure 1A), MDM2 expression was significantly elevated in testicular samples from MA patients at both mRNA (Figure 3E) and protein levels (Figure 3F), as compared with NC. These data point to a possibility that, in vivo, miR-509-5p may also negatively regulate MDM2 expression in the testes.
Enforced Expression Of MDM2 Rescues miR-509-5p Effects On Testicular Germ Cell Tumor Cells
Finally, to clarify whether MDM2 mediates miR-509-5p effects on TGCT cells, we performed the enforced expression

of MDM2 in NT-2 and NCCIT cells transfected with synthetic miR-509-5p mimic so as to restore its suppressed expression (Figure 4A and D). Importantly, in pace with the restored MDM2 expression, the miR-509-5p-suppressed proliferation (Figure 4B) and -induced apoptosis (Figure 4C) in NT-2 cells were considerably recovered. Additionally, similar results could be obtained using NCCIT cells (Figure 4E and F). Therefore, a conclusion could be drawn that MDM2 is a critical downstream effector through which miR-509-5p imposes anti-proliferative and pro-apoptosis effects on TGCT cells. Besides, in consideration of the altered expression levels of miR-509-5p and MDM2 in testicular samples from MA patients, the miR-509-5p/MDM2 axis may also have functional relevance to disease pathology, which is of interest and clinical significance to be addressed by further investigations.

(A-C) NT2 cells were transfected with NC mimic or 100 nM miR-509-5p mimic in combination with pcDNA3.1-vector or pcDNA3.1-MDM2.

Discussion
We found that miR-509-5p was decreased and its level was negatively associated with the proliferation activity in germ cells from infertile men with MA. We also discovered that miR-509-5p not only suppressed proliferation but also induced apoptosis of TGCT cells in vitro, and further proved that MDM2, as a downstream target of miR-509-5p, is vital for mediating these roles of miR-509-5p. Thus, our study may identify miR-509-5p as a novel candidate miRNA that is associated with the pathogenesis of male infertility due to MA, and also provide a mechanistic insight into the previously unrecognized tumor suppressive roles of miR-5095p in TGCT.
PCNA is essential for DNA duplication during cell cycle progression, and it has been demonstrated to serve as a useful molecular marker for evaluating germ cell proliferation kinetics and the testes spermatogenic function of male infertility.30-32 We found that PCNA expression was significantly upregulated in testicular biopsy specimens from MA patients, and meanwhile, miR-509-5p expression was downregulated and negatively correlated well with PCNA. Further, we demonstrated that miR-5095p exhibited an anti-proliferative activity in TGCT cells. According to these clues, we suppose it is very possible that serving as a negative regulator of proliferation, miR509-5p downregulation may contribute to the hyperactive germ cell proliferation which eventually causes spermatogenic arrest and male infertility. However, the limitation is that it remains unclear whether miR-509-5p affects meiotic spermatocytes or haploid differentiated spermatids only based on our available data. Further investigations on revealing the cellular distribution of miR-509-5p in testicular tissues would be helpful to fully address miR-509-5p functions in different stages of spermatogenesis.
On the other hand, for clinical diagnosis of male infertility, the diagnostic tools are limited and the frequently used method is semen analysis which offers an almost crude estimation.33 There is a need of additional diagnostic biomarkers for evaluating male fertility. It has been proposed that the altered expression levels of miRNAs in male infertility may serve as potential good biomarkers for diagnosis.16 The significant downregulation of miR509-5p in male infertility with MA implies that it may be useful in assisting the diagnosis of this subtype of male infertility. Whether miR-509-5p expression displays alteration in other subtypes of male infertility is uncertain, which needs to be clarified in the future.

We then show that miR-509-5p limits proliferation and
induces apoptosis of NT-2 and NCCIT cells through tar-
geting MDM2, therefore extending its tumor-suppressive
activities into TGCT. We found that MDM2 expression
was induced in testicular samples from MA patients,
which hints that MDM2 may play a role in its pathology.
The genetic variants in MDM2 have been found to be associated with male infertility.34 It is interesting to inves-
tigate the mechanistic connection of MDM2 to male infer-
tility. Typically, TGCT is derived from the germ cells of testis.35 Besides, it is known that the male infertility is a
risk factor for the development of testicular cancer, including TGCT.36 Our findings of miR-509-5p downregulation and reverse correlation with germ cell proliferation in MA
patients combined with its tumor-suppressive activities in
TGCT cells may offer a new clue to understand the con-
nection between male infertility and TGCT.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a rare progressive liver disease characterized by cholestasis and bile duct fibrosis, has no accepted, effective therapy known to delay or arrest its progression. We report a 15 year old female patient diagnosed with PSC and moderate chronic active ulcerative colitis (UC) who achieved normalization of her liver enzymes and bile ducts, and resolution of her UC symptoms with colonic mucosal healing, after treatment with a single drug therapy of the antibiotic oral vancomycin. We postulate that the oral vancomycin may be acting both as an antibiotic by altering the intestinal microbiome and as an immunomodulator. Oral vancomycin may be a promising treatment for PSC that needs to be further studied in randomized trials.

INTRODUCTION
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare progressive disease of the liver characterized by cholestasis and bile duct fibrosis, leading to decreased quality of life, cirrhosis, and the need for liver transplantation within an average of 12 years [1]. The disease occurs in children and adults, and is closely linked with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most often colitis, especially ulcerative colitis (UC) [1]. Small-duct PSC has an overall better long-term prognosis than large-duct PSC [2]. While the patho-

genesis of PSC remains obscure, a leading theory is that an abnormal gut microbiome activates innate immunity within the liver, resulting in bile duct-targeted inflammation and biliary fibrosis [1]. Presently, there are no effective therapies known to delay the progression of PSC. In this case, a single antibiotic, oral vancomycin, led to normalization of the patient's liver enzymes.

diarrhea after taking doxycycline daily for acne treatment 4 months prior to initiation of symptoms. She was diagnosed with blastocystis hominis and treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole (for 10 days), and later with nitazoxanide (for 4 days). Her symptoms improved while on the ciprofloxacin/ metronidazole, but returned when the treatment was completed. She was admitted to the hospital 3 months later with erythema nodosum which resolved without treatment. She discontinued the doxycycline treatment just prior to her hospitalization. Her labs showed slight elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were positive at 113.9 EU/mL. The patient was diagnosed by colonoscopy with moderate chronic active ulcerative pancolitis and was started on mesalamine, which she did not tolerate and had worsening bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. She was transitioned to 9 mg of budesonide and later also to 6,750 mg/day balsalazide, the latter which also caused worsening diarrhea. The patient elected to stop all medication and started herbal remedies for 6 months: VSL#3 probiotic, curcumin, and Nopalea (cactus juice; Trivita in Scottsdale, AZ, USA). The patient continued to experience diarrhea up to 4-5 times a day and azathioprine was initiated. Screening blood tests

for azathioprine therapy in August 2012 revealed increased liver enzymes (Fig. 1). Quantitative immunoglobulin G (IgG) was normal and screening for hepatic autoimmune antibodies (anti-nuclear antibodies, anti- smooth muscle antibodies, and anti-liver/kidney microsomal antibodies) was negative. The IgG subclasses panel showed normal IgG4. A magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed localized common hepatic duct prominence measuring 7 mm proximally at the porta hepatis of uncertain significance with no changes of PSC. A liver biopsy showed mild portal lymphocytic infiltrates with focal infiltration of bile duct epithelium. Several small and medium-size bile ducts were surrounded by concentric fibrosis with mild bile ductular proliferation. There was no significant fibrosis. Findings were consistent with small-duct PSC (Fig. 2).
With the diagnosis of PSC, the patient was started on ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 300 mg 2 per day. The liver enzymes improved but did not normalize (Fig. 1). She developed intolerance to azathioprine: nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which resolved with discontinuation of the medicine. Over the next two months, she continued to have diarrhea and malaise. She was started on 500 mg oral vancomycin 3 per day (35 mg/kg) for the management of PSC as the patient was reluctant to start infliximab.

The diarrhea resolved within three days, and after several weeks stools became solid. UDCA was discontinued after starting oral vancomycin.
The patient gained weight, fatigue significantly improved and within 2 months, the patient began menarche. After 9 months of therapy, transaminases had not normalized, and the dose of vancomycin was increased to 750 mg 3 per day (40 mg/kg) leading to normalization of liver enzymes with only mild gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) elevation (Fig. 1). Patient's surveillance MRCPs in 2 and 3 years following the diagnosis showed a normal liver with resolution of the localized hepatic duct prominence and normal bile ducts. Surveillance colonoscopies in each subsequent year showed nearly normal, with only quiescent to mild chronic colitis on biopsy. Vancomycin dose was reduced to 1,000 mg 2 per day (35 mg/kg) and her liver function tests (LFTs) remained fully normalized. The patient has continued on this dose to date and it is well tolerated. She has had no infections. She has continued to have normal bowel movements and normal LFTs, other than transient elevations in the LFTs when she contracted acute infectious mononucleosis (Fig. 1).
DISCUSSION
PSC, a rare progressive liver disease characterized by cholestasis and bile duct fibrosis, has no accepted,

effective therapy known to delay or arrest its progression. UC is an IBD of unclear etiology characterized by diffuse mucosal inflammation of the rectum and the colon. At diagnosis, pediatric UC associated with PSC is often more severe and extensive and many patients are affected with pancolitis. Pediatric UC can be very aggressive with a high frequency of acute severe exacerbations. Patients with UC are known to develop PSC in 4-5% of cases [3], therefore, patients with IBD should be screened for abnormal liver enzymes. Other causes of abnormal LFTs in patients with IBD may be autoimmune hepatitis, drug hepatotoxicity, disease flare, and malnutrition.
UDCA has been extensively utilized as a therapeutic option for the treatment of pediatric PSC. One uncontrolled pilot study showed that UDCA improved liver biochemistries, however there is no evidence that UDCA alters the progression of disease [4,5]. A multicenter study of adults with PSC using high-dose UDCA (28-30 mg/kg/day) over 5 years showed improvement in liver biochemistries, however the study had to be terminated because of an increased risk of death and liver transplantation in the UDCA group [6].
Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic with bactericidal activity against many gram-positive bacteria. Patients with UC and PSC who are treated with oral vancomycin have been shown to improve both UC symptoms and liver biochemistries [7-9], suggesting that oral vancomycin could be of therapeutic benefit in patients with PSC-UC. A study with 14 pediatric patients with PSC and concurrent active IBD treated with oral vancomycin showed significant improvement in GGT, ALT, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate values within 3 months of therapy [8]. These patients also measured higher levels of transforming growth factor-, an anti-inflammatory protein, and regulatory T cells (inhibits autoimmunity) indicating a potential immunoregulatory mechanism of action of vancomycin [7]. Oral vancomycin treatment was also effective in the treatment of a pediatric patient with recurrent PSC after an orthotopic liver transplantation, suggesting a disease mechanism

with some causes external to the liver--potentially from the gut bacteria [10].
In children and adolescents, ALP may be elevated due to accelerated growth and bone metabolism, therefore GGT is a followed as a marker of biliary disease. The patient had a diagnosis of small duct PSC and had no fibrosis at diagnosis, which generally has a more benign course [2]. An additional benefit associated with the oral vancomycin treatment was the resolution of the patient's UC symptoms and colonic mucosal healing. The oral vancomycin may be acting both as an antibiotic by altering the intestinal microbiome and as an immunomodulator. The microbiome has been shown to affect a spectrum of liver diseases as intestinal blood flows through the portal tract. Modulating the microbiome through oral vancomycin, which mostly affects gram positive bacteria, may have resulted in decreased PSC activity and normalization of GGT. Another mechanism is a direct immunomodulatory effect of oral vancomycin. Oral vancomycin is given orally with minimal systemic absorption, therefore the effect is likely via the intestines. Based upon this single case report and a case series, oral vancomycin may be a promising treatment for PSC that needs to be further studied in randomized trials.

ObjectiveaaThe study was conducted to investigate the association between economic status and depressive symptoms by comparing the prevalence rates of depressive symptoms at community level and analyzing the possibility of depressive symptoms at individual level. MethodsaaA survey was conducted from November, 2006 to November, 2007 on 966 and 992 representative subjects recruited by stratified clustered sampling in two regions located in Seoul. We used a standardized questionnaire including the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression and questions on the socioeconomic characteristics. The adjusted prevalence rates of depressive symptoms were compared at community level, and multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between depressive symptoms and economic statuses at individual level among each region. ResultsaaThe adjusted prevalence of depressive symptoms was higher in the region with a high socioeconomic status (23.1%) than in the region with a lower economic status (16.6%)(p<0.001). However, logistic regression analysis of individual level revealed that a higher economic status was significantly associated with a lower possibility of depressive symptoms among the females in the low economic status region. This tendency was not observed among the males in both of the regions. ConclusionaaThe association between economic status and depressive symptoms was found to be different when it was approached at community level or individual level. In addition, the association of two variables was different by gender at individual level. Further studies that consider the third mediators are needed to determine the association between the two variables.

showed worse health conditions, like a high death rate and high disease morbidity, and this tendency has recently became severer.2-5 In Korea, the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reported that a population with a low educational status and poorer job conditions showed higher morbidity from chronic diseases.6 In particular, a study reported that an income gap accounted for 30% of the direct factors that made a difference in heath.7
This tendency has been similarly shown for psychiatric disorders, and a low socioeconomic status has generally been observed to be related with high psychiatric morbidity. According to a meta-analysis conducted by Lorant et al.8 a low socioeconomic status was found to be related with the prevalence of depression. In a study on the association between depression and socioeconomic status in Korea, Cho et al.9 reported

a result from a nationwide sample analysis that was similar to those of the previous studies in foreign countries.
However, the results of the current research on the association of depression, among different psychiatric disorders, with the economic status seem to be controversial. Dohrenwend & Dohrenwend10 reviewed the literature on psychiatric disorders, and they found that although the overall rate of psychopathology was higher in the group with a low economic level, depressive neurosis showed a different result. Kohn et al.11 also reported that the relation between depression and economic status was controversial and they suggested that further study was needed.
As to association between economic status and depressive symptoms, not depressive disorder, Kim et al.12 found that the prevalence of depressive symptoms was different according to monthly income and the educational status in a study on community dwellers. Research by Kahng & Kwon13 also revealed that persons with a relatively low socioeconomic status such as low income, a low educational background and being female showed a high level of depression. However, association of depressive symptoms and economic status needs to be studied more, considering the controversial association of depressive disorder and economic condition.
Most of the previous studies analyzed data by using an individual level approach to determine the risk factors for depressive symptoms. Therefore, this study took two types of approaches to determine the association between economic characteristics and depressive symptoms. We compared the prevalences of depressive symptoms in the level of regions with low and high economic statuses, and then analyzed the association of two variables in the level of individuals in each region
METHODS
Subjects and the sampling method Residents living in two regions (or 2 Gus) of Seoul were re-
cruited as the subjects of this study. One out of the two regions (or 2 Gus) has a population of about 430,000 and it has the highest level of financial independence and the highest mean monthly income of the residents among the 25 regions (or Gus) of Seoul. The other region (or gu) with a population of around 400,000 showed middle levels of financial independence and an average mean monthly income of the residents.14 However, one community (or a dong) in this latter region has a high average monthly income that raises the overall economic status of the region and the economic status of other communities (or dongs), and except for this dong the other communities have a relatively low economic status. Through stratified clustered random sampling of the two regions, house-

SJ Jo et al.
holds were selected and in a chosen household a family member with the earliest date of birth was recruited as the subjects of this study. A `Dong' in each region was stratified into three strata or six strata in the A Gu and the B Gu, respectively, and one or two `Dong' was selected randomly from each strata with the `Dong' as a primary sampling unit. With `Ban' as a secondary sampling unit, the `Ban' was chosen in proportion to a number of households from the selected `Dong' through systematic random sampling, and five households were randomly selected from the chosen `Ban'. When the number of samples was calculated under the conditions of a 95% confidence interval and a 5% margin of error to estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms of a population, the minimum sample size of each `Gu' was 854. The number of subjects finally examined in this study was 966 and 992 in the A `Gu' and B `Gu', respectively.
Measurements The questionnaire used in this study consisted of five ques-
tions concerned with socioeconomic characteristics such as gender, age, the monthly family income, the educational status and marital status, a question about residence and then there were 20 questions to detect depressive symptoms. The scale used to screen depressive symptoms was the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale and among its three standardized Korean-versions, a tool standardized by Cho and Kim15 was utilized for this study. It is a self-reporting scale that consists of 20 questions. These questions are scored with 0-3 points and the total score is 0-60 points. Using 21 points as a criterion, which has been reported to be an optimal cut-off point for an epidemiological survey in a community, the persons recording 21 or more points were classified as a depressive symptom group.
Data collection For data collection, a trained researcher and a community
resident as a team visited the selected households from November, 2006 to November, 2007. After confirming the subject in each household, the standardized questionnaire was given to him/her and he/she answered it by himself/herself. If a subject could not read the questionnaire because of illiteracy or weak eyesight, then the questionnaire was answered via an interview. When it was returned, the researcher checked whether or not there were some missing answers. A survey manager reviewed the questionnaires every three days for the researcher to reexamine for missing values or illogical answers.
Data analysis After dual entry of the collected data was performed by two
trained persons, the entry errors were found and corrected

and the missing values were replaced by using the nearest neighbor imputation methods. For the regional level analysis on the association between economic status and depressive symptoms, the prevalence of depressive symptoms in each region was compared using 2 tests. The effect of economic status on depressive symptoms at individual level was analyzed with multiple logistic regression analysis by stratifying the subjects according to gender, and the analysis was adjusted for age, the educational status and the marital status in each region.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Catholic University of Korea.
RESULTS
Socioeconomic characteristics The socioeconomic characteristics of the subjects are pre-

sented in Table 1. Gender and marital status did not show any significant difference between the two regions. For age, the percentage of a population aged less than 40 years was higher in the low economic status (ES) region than in the high ES region (45.9% and 35.9%, respectively) while the percentage of a population aged in the 40s was higher in the high ES region than in the low ES region (28.2% and 22.3%, respectively). As the percentage of a population aged 50 or older was also higher in the high ES region than in the low ES region, the age in the high ES region was found to be older overall than that of the other region (p<0.001).
The average monthly family income tended to be higher in the high ES region than in the low ES region. Although the subjects with an income of over 4 million won/month accounted for less than 20% of the total subjects in the low ES region, the subjects with the same income level accounted

for about 50% of the total subjects in the high ES region. While the subjects with an income of less than 2 million won/month were about 40% in the low ES region, those with the same income level exceeded 20% in the high ES region (p<0.001).
The rates of high school graduates and college, university or higher educational institution graduates were 36.1% and 47.9%, respectively, in the low ES region and 16.1% and 75.9%, respectively, in the high ES region and the educational status was also relatively higher in the high ES region than that in the low ES region.
Crude and standardized prevalence of depressive symptoms among the subjects in the high and low-economic status regions
The prevalence of depressive symptoms in the high ES region was 23.1% and that of the low ES region was 16.3%, so the prevalence of depressive symptoms was higher in the region with a better economic status (p<0.001).
Because the difference in the crude prevalence of depressive symptoms between the regions with high and low economic statuses could be caused by the difference in the composition of the population, the prevalence rates, as standardized by gender and age, were compared. As a result, the adjusted prevalence of depressive symptoms in the region with a high economic status was also higher than that of the other region (23.1% and 16.6%, respectively), the same as the crude prevalence (Figure 1).
Association of economic status and depressive symptoms at individual level

than a million won/month as the reference group, an increase by a million won/month of income significantly reduced the possibility of depressive symptoms {odds ratio (OR): 0.5820.321} as a whole. According to the results of the analysis performed by stratifying the subjects by gender, among the males, only the group with the highest average monthly family income showed such a tendency, and among the females, a higher income level was associated with a lower possibility of depressive symptoms for all income groups (OR: 0.559-0.349).
When the association between economic status and depressive symptoms was investigated after stratifying by region, the region with a low economic status showed a trend that was similar with the results of all the subjects. But the region with a high economic status showed a different result. In other words, the possibility of depressive symptoms of only the two groups with the highest income was lower significantly than that of the reference group. But the analysis stratified by gender revealed that males showed no significant difference in the possibility of depressive symptoms according to their economic status (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
Various rates of the prevalence of depression have been reported for different countries. The National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) in the U.S. reported that the lifetime prevalence of major depression was 16.2%,16 and the prevalence of major depression in Korea, Taiwan and Canada was reported to be 5.6%,17 1.1%18 and 8.6%,19 respectively, so there was a large difference in the prevalence of major depression around the world. These studies used structured diagnostic scales like the Present State Examination (PSE), the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) or the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) to investigate the prevalence of depression. Although these scales can diagnose the disease as their advantage, it takes a long time to assess subjects using these tools and it is expensive. Therefore, it is not easy to apply them to community studies.
On the contrary, the CES-D and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) cannot diagnose depression, but they are easy to use for a survey and the time needed to assess subjects is short as a self-administered form, so these tools can be viewed as an economical approach to screen depressive symptoms. In particular, the CES-D is a scale designed for performing an epidemiological survey in a general population and it has been widely used for population surveys around the world.20 The prevalence of depressive symptoms reported in the research using the CES-D tends to be higher than that of studies using diagnostic scales, but the two prevalence rates using these tools have still been fairly consistent.21
Studies using the CES-D have shown relatively variable pre-

valence rates of depressive symptoms even though a same cutoff point was applied. As for the research with the cut-off point of 16, the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (H-HANES) in the U.S. revealed that 12.9% of the subjects had depressive symptoms22 and the research of Madianos et al.23 performed in Greece found that 17.6% of the community adults showed depressive symptoms. Cho et al.21 reported that the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 25.3% in their nationwide community-based study. Our study used 21 points as the cut-off by following the suggestion of Cho et al.15 who said that an optimal cut-off point for the primary screening of depressive symptoms was 21 points in a community-based epidemiological survey in Korea. We found that the prevalence rates of depressive symptoms in the two regions were 16.6% and 23.1% after adjusting for gender and age.
This study compared the prevalence of depressive symptoms in a high-economic status region with that of a low-economic status region by using same tool, the CES-D, during the same time period. Out of the two regions, the region with the higher economic status was called `the richest Gu' out of the 25 Gus in Seoul with 75.5% of the families being financial in-

dependence and the average monthly family income is 4.81 million won. On the contrary, the other region with a low economic status showed a middle level of financial independence and an average monthly family income level at 66.9% and 3.97 million won, respectively. Because one `dong' in the low-economic status region significantly contributed to the total economic status, the overall level of this region, except the one wealthy `dong', had lower financial independence and a lower average monthly family income.14
When the prevalence of depressive symptoms in the two regions was compared, the prevalence of depression in the better economic status region was higher than that of the other region (23.1% and 16.3%, respectively). This finding was similar with the results of comparison between the prevalence of depressive disorder according to countries. As was mentioned above, when the nationwide prevalence rates of depression were compared in the U.S, the NCS reported that the lifetime prevalence of depression, as investigated with a diagnostic scale, was 16.2%16 and in Korea a nationwide survey conducted by using the same scale (the 2005 Epidemiological Survey of Psychiatric Illnesses) reported that the prevalence of depres-

198 Psychiatry Investig 2011;8:194-200

sion was 5.6%.17 So, the prevalence of depression in a country with a better economic status was observed to be relatively high. Two reports that measured the prevalence rates of depression with the DIS around the same time also showed this tendency, as the lifetime prevalence of depression in New Zealand in 1990 was 12.6% and this was higher than that of Puerto Rico in 1987 (4.6%).24 As for the studies that focused on the prevalence of depression using the PSE, Camberwell in England (1981) and Canberra in Australia (1979) reported that the prevalence of depression was 7.1% and 6.1%, respectively, and there was not a large difference.25 Like this, the economically more advanced countries have tended to show a relatively higher prevalence of depression, but this is somewhat uncertain because the subjects, the survey time and period, the scales and the diagnostic criteria of the studies were not the same. A study by Wang on the rural-urban differences in the prevalence of major depression asserted that the difference of the prevalence of depression between rural and urban areas was related with a geographical region, and they carefully suggested that the different cultural and social contexts in each region could affect the development of depression.26 If the result of our current study was interpreted in this context, there was a possibility that the different socio-cultural atmosphere in the two regions could affect the factors or frequencies of feeling depressive symptoms. Such a possibility could be supported not only by comparing the prevalence of depressive symptoms at a regional level, but also by making such a comparison at individual level.
When the odds ratio of depressive symptoms according to the economic status level in each region was calculated at individual level, the possibility of depressive symptoms tended to decline according to an increase of every million won/month among the females in the low economic status region. However, among the females in the high socioeconomic status region this trend was observed only in the two groups with the highest average monthly family income. In other words, females with a same average monthly family income had a higher possibility of depressive symptoms in the high-economic status region than in the other region. This is the similar trend as that of a study by Weich et al.27 They reported that individual income interacted with a regional unequal distribution of income to affect the severity of a psychiatric disorder. The reason for this result could be because the differences in the socio-cultural atmosphere according to region provoked differences in the subjective emotion felt by residents in each region even though they had same economic conditions.
Interestingly, the different possibility of depressive symptoms according to the average monthly family income was found only for females. After controlling for age, the educational status and the marital status, the possibility of depressive

SJ Jo et al.
symptoms among females was significantly different according to their income level, but that of the males was not significantly affected by the income level. Like this, more and more research has suggested that a third factor works on the association between the income level and depressive symptoms. Kahng & Kwon13 reported that although the prevalence of depressive symptoms was lower in individuals with a high income level than that of those individuals with a low income level, this tendency was clearly observed among the subjects aged 40 years or older, but the difference became smaller among the subjects aged less than 40 years, so age showed interaction in the relationship between the two variables. The same interaction was also reported in a study by House et al.28 The result of this study showed that multi-dimensional factors should be considered when choosing interventions to solve problems related with the inequalities of psychiatric health.
The studies on the association between the economic status and depressive disorder have generally reported that a higher socioeconomic level was related with a lower prevalence of depression.29-33 Such relationship can be explained by the stress theory. According to this theory, personal resources such as coping style, self-esteem and locus of control reduce the impact of stress on depression, and individuals with a high socioeconomic level have more resources.34,35 In the meantime, the strain theory emphasizes the effects of community features like values, social welfare, social cohesion and public health policies.36,37 However, the reported evidence for contextual effects on psychiatric disorders is rather controversial.38,39
The results of this study that analyzed the association of economic status and depressive symptoms, not depressive disorder, support the stress theory in the individual level analysis, but the results somewhat conflict with the strain theory in the community level analysis. Therefore, further study on the association between the socioeconomic level and depressive symptoms with using strain theory is needed.

The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) agonist muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a peptidoglycan motif common to all bacteria, supports leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5)+ intestinal stem cell (ISC) survival through NOD2 activation upon an otherwise lethal oxidative stress-mediated signal. However, the underlying protective mechanisms remain unknown. Here, using irradiation as stressor and primarily murine-derived intestinal organoids as a model system, we show that MDP induced a significant reduction of total and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) within ISCs, which was associated with mitophagy induction. ATG16L1 knockout (KO) and NOD2 KO organoids did not benefit from the MDP-induced cytoprotection. We confirmed the MDP-dependent induction of ISC mitophagy upon stress in vivo. These findings elucidate the NOD2-mediated mechanism of cytoprotection involving the clearance of the lethal excess of ROS molecules through mitophagy, triggered by the coordinated activation of NOD2 and ATG16L1 by a nuclear factor B (NF-B)-independent pathway.
LGR5 intestinal stem cells | NOD2 | ROS | autophagy | muramyl dipeptide
In the gut epithelium, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) expressing leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) are located at the bottom of crypts and are actively cycling (1). The maintenance of LGR5+ ISCs is essential for the regulation of an active epithelial repair following toxic and infectious injuries. These deleterious cytotoxic processes are largely mediated by the activation of the oxidative-stress machinery, leading to a massive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (2, 3).
Bacterial metabolites can control cell proliferation; for instance, butyrate has been shown to have an antiproliferative effect on ISCs (4). In addition, some microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) were shown to promote tissue repair through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) upon chemically induced damage (5), while lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria induces a direct cytotoxic effect on ISCs through TLR4 signaling (6, 7). In contrast, as previously demonstrated by our group, the muramyl dipeptide (MDP)-nucleotide-binding oligomerization domaincontaining protein 2 (NOD2) signaling pathway plays a cytoprotective role of ISCs, which express high levels of NOD2 transcripts. Cytoprotection was particularly prominent in ISCs subjected to the cytotoxic compound doxorubicin, a DNA-intercalating agent and promoter of excessive ROS production (8). However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cytoprotection downstream of MDP-NOD2 activation remain to be elucidated.
NOD2-mediated MDP sensing can initiate autophagy in specific immune cell types such as dendritic cells (9, 10). Autophagy

is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that maintains cellular homeostasis by degrading damaged organelles, which includes mitochondria (mitophagy) in autophagosomes (11). Since mitochondria are a major source of intracellular ROS, alterations to mitophagy lead to elevated ROS levels (12, 13), thereby causing cytotoxicity that may significantly affect epithelial repair following ROSinducing stress conditions.
In this study, using irradiation as a stressor in order to induce ROS-mediated LGR5+ ISC cytotoxicity, we investigated if the MDP-NOD2 pathway of cytoprotection was mediated by activation of autophagy, thereby mitigating mitochondrial ROS release. Utilizing small intestinal organoids of wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice (14), we found that MDP counteracts ISC
Significance
The intestinal epithelium represents the most vigorously renewing adult tissue in mammals. The renewal process is supported by the presence of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Here we decipher a pathway of ISC cytoprotection mediated by a microbiota-derived product, the muramyl dipeptide (MDP). During stress conditions, recognition of MDP by the cytosolic sensor NOD2, which is expressed at high levels in ISCs, mediates the clearance of lethal excess of ROS molecules. The coordinated action of the autophagic protein ATG16L1 and NOD2 mediates the activation of a mitophagic process to eliminate damaged mitochondria and therefore protection of ISCs. We show a link between mitophagymediated ROS clearance and bacterial MDP stimulation in ISCs, therefore elucidating a role of the microbiota in epithelial regeneration.

mitochondrial ROS by stimulating mitochondrial clearance via ATG16L1. In this context, ATG16L1 appeared to have a central role in the induction of mitophagy in addition to the blockage of nuclear factor B (NF-B) activity. These findings unravel a major protective mechanism of epithelial regeneration provided by the intestinal microbiota following chemical/physical, toxic, and possibly infectious aggression.
Results MDP Selectively Protects LGR5+ ISCs from Irradiation Damage and Enhances Epithelial Renewal. To elucidate the mediated effects of bacterial motifs on ISCs after irradiation (XRT), we cultured organoids from murine small intestinal crypts in the presence of purified or synthetic MAMPs. NOD receptors were stimulated by a soluble sonicated peptidoglycan (PGN) as a global NOD agonist, or a tripeptide containing meso-diaminopimelic acid (Tridap) and MDP as NOD1 and NOD2 agonists, respectively. Synthetic lipoprotein (Pam3CSK), Escherichia coli O111:B4 LPS, Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium flagellin (Fla), and synthetic unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (CpGs) were also tested to stimulate TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9, respectively. In order to ensure the inclusion of MAMPs into the organoid

lumen, the compounds were added to isolated crypts prior to embedding into Matrigel (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). From the luminal compartment, MAMPs may directly interact with the apical TLRs and/or be transported into the cells through a transporter, such as SLC15A1 (PepT1) for the NOD ligands (15). Organoids were left to mature for 3 d of in vitro culture prior to subjection to an XRT dose-response study where 2 Gy was identified as optimal in order to induce an average of 50% lethality at day 6 post-XRT treatment. Thus, this irradiation dose was used for all of the subsequent experiments presented in this study (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). Three days upon MAMP stimulation, the organoids were irradiated (D0) and the number of viable organoids was monitored 6 d after XRT. Upon stimulation with PGN and MDP, an increased number of surviving organoids was observed as shown by an increment of up to 33% in the presence of MDP and up to 41% in the presence of PGN as compared with nonstimulated organoids (control; CTRL). Interestingly, none of the other MAMPs had any effect on organoid survival, including the NOD1 agonist Tridap (Fig. 1A). The MDP-mediated protective effect was observed in organoids obtained from both WT and NOD1 KO mice but not present in those from NOD2 KO mice (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C), indicating a role of NOD2 independent of NOD1.

XRT has been shown to induce cell death via immediate apoptosis--primarily mediated by ROS production (16). To further assess if the effect of MDP is mediated via protection of LGR5+ ISCs from XRT-induced apoptotic cell death, organoids from GFP-LGR5 mice were cultured with or without MDP, irradiated, and assessed for the induction of apoptosis 4 h poststimuli. Independent of the stimulation (MDP and control), irradiation exhibited extensive epithelial apoptosis (positive for

cleaved caspase-3) in whole organoids. In contrast, GFP-expressing LGR5+ ISCs located at the budding site of the organoids (considered crypt-like domains; SI Appendix, Fig. S1D) presented a significantly lower number of cleaved caspase-3-positive events in the MDP-stimulated organoid group when compared with nonstimulated controls (Fig. 1 B and C). As reported in our previous analysis, no differences were observed in the maximal size of the organoids comparing stimulated and nonstimulated organoids, and

epithelial proliferation was also not affected by the presence of MDP (8).
To assess if the cytoprotective effect of MDP translated into an increase in the total LGR5+ ISC pool, we quantified the number of LGR5+ ISCs upon MDP stimulation in organoids generated from GFP-LGR5 mice. The concentration of LGR5GFP cells (fluorescence-activated cell sorting [FACS] analysis) and the mean GFP fluorescence intensity (live imaging) were quantified 2 d following XRT (i.e., D2). Upon XRT, the number of LGR5-GFP cells was less than 50% compared with nonirradiated CTRL, while only a slight reduction was observed in the presence of MDP (Fig. 1D). This increased number of surviving ISCs in the presence of MDP was confirmed by measuring the GFP-LGR5 ISC mean intensity signal per organoid by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1E and SI Appendix, Fig. S1D). Further, gene expression analysis of whole organoids showed that the ISC marker (Lgr5) but not the Paneth cell (PC) marker (LyzP) was increased upon XRT in the presence of MDP (Fig. 1F). We then checked the gene expression levels of Nod2 in sorted ISCs from organoids upon XRT vs. nonirradiated cells (sorting strategy in SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). Upon irradiation, Nod2 was induced more than 2 times, suggesting a role for this receptor in LGR5+ ISCs during a stress response (Fig. 1G). Collectively, these results show that MDP stimulation upon applied stress leads to protection of LGR5+ ISCs in vitro.
To investigate this phenomenon further, we assessed if the presence of MDP allowed for LGR5+ ISC-mediated epithelial renewal in organoids after irradiation. Lineage-tracing experiments were performed in organoids generated from GFP-LGR5;mTmG mice, in which LGR5+ ISCs and their daughter cells express a membrane-bound red fluorescent tdTomato (mT) in their nave state but switch to cell membrane-localized GFP (mG) expression upon 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) induction. Organoids with entirely switched fluorescence from mT to mG, and therefore from red to green membranes (hereafter described as "switched" organoids), were counted at D2 (Fig. 1H). After XRT, MDP stimulation induced the switch of 35% of organoids (as in the CTRL condition) as compared with 20% in XRT alone, indicating that the MDP-NOD2 axis preserves LGR5+ ISC numbers, enabling intestinal epithelial regeneration.
MDP Mitigates LGR5+ ISC Mitochondrial ROS Levels. ISCs display high mitochondrial activity levels and it has been shown that oxidative metabolism is crucial for ISC proliferation and differentiation (17). Thus, at low levels, ROS is a component of important signaling pathways involved in the maintenance of normal cellular functions. At high levels, in contrast, ROS can be deleterious for cellular functions. XRT induces short-term water radiolysis and a high generation of ROS leading to both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage, disrupting mitochondrial functions (16). We examined whether MDP may limit the production of ROS in LGR5+ ISCs after XRT in vitro. Intracellular ROS and mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) levels were monitored (by live microscopy) and quantified (by flow cytometry) using CellROX (cytosolic ROS staining) or ROSstar (a hydrocyanin-based probe of intracellular ROS staining) reagents and MitoSOX Red (mtROS staining) reagent, respectively. In GFP-LGR5 ISCs, total (Fig. 2 A and B) and mitochondrial (Fig. 2 C and D) ROS levels increased significantly 1 h after XRT in control organoids but not after MDP stimulation. Moreover, using MitoTracker Deep Red reagent, a reduction in the total amount of mitochondria was observed upon XRT in MDP-stimulated samples as compared with nonstimulated controls (Fig. 2 C and E). These results indicate the clearance of damaged mitochondria through activation of MDPmediated mitophagy.
MDP-NOD2 Signaling Triggers ISC Autophagy but Not Inflammatory Immune Response. Upon pathogen invasion, NOD2 has a crucial role in the autophagic process by recruiting ATG16L1 to the plasma

membrane and the induction of autophagosome formation (10, 18). To investigate if the observed reduction of mitochondria was due to the MDP-mediated activation of autophagy in ISCs, we generated organoids from GFP-LC3 mice and stimulated them or not with MDP. We quantified the activation of autophagy by measuring GFP-LC3 levels by flow cytometry (12) and counting GFPLC3 puncta by confocal imaging. We showed an MDP-mediated increase in the GFP-LC3 signal in vitro (Fig. 3A), and most prominently in the crypt-like domain, where the LGR5+ ISCs are located in comparison with the villus-like domain (Fig. 3B). Utilizing confocal imaging, we further confirmed that MDP induced autophagosomes, as identified by an anti-LC3B antibody, in LGR5+ ISCs (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A).
We therefore assessed if NOD2-mediated autophagy was also associated with the induction of NF-B and, consequently, the release of the proinflammatory cytokine CXCL1, which served as a bona fide marker of NF-B activation. Following MDP stimulation, CXCL1 levels of WT organoids remained unchanged, while in ATG16L1 KO, we observed a 3-fold induction in cytokine production. Recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), used as positive control, led to increased CXCL1 levels in both WT and ATG16L1 KO stimulated organoids (Fig. 3C). Similarly, in WT organoids, we did not detect nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of the transcription factor NF-B upon MDP stimulation in contrast to MDP-stimulated ATG16L1 KO organoids (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that ATG16L1 plays a central role in the activation of the autophagic machinery while inhibiting MDP-mediated NF-B translocation. This dissociation of the NOD2-mediated innate immune response is likely due to ATG16L1 serving as a negative regulator of the NOD2driven activation of the RIP2 pathway which activates NF-B.
Autophagy Mediates LGR5+ ISC MDP-NOD2-Induced Cytoprotection. To study whether autophagy was involved in the observed ISC regeneration, we evaluated the crypts' potential for intestinal epithelial regeneration in vitro by utilizing a crypt-organoid- formation assay. The organoid-formation capacity of the crypts from both ATG16L1 KO and NOD2 KO mice was significantly reduced compared with those from WT mice (Fig. 4A and SI Appendix, Fig. S2B), suggesting that stress induced by crypt extraction was sufficient to activate the autophagic protective pathway in the WT. To explore if this effect was specific to ISCs, we artificially increased the number of ISCs per organoid. Wnt3 and Notch signals are essential for intestinal epithelial stemness (19). The combination of CHIR99021 (Chir; a GSK3 inhibitor that activates the Wnt pathway) and valproic acid (VPA; a histone deacetylase [HDAC] inhibitor that activates Notch) increased organoid-formation efficiency and maintained LGR5+ ISCs in an undifferentiated, self-renewing state (20) (SI Appendix, Fig. S2C). The addition of 100 nM bafilomycin A1 (an autophagy inhibitor) to the crypt media decreased organoidformation capacity, similar to extracted crypts from both ATG16L1 KO and NOD2 KO mice, and dramatically decreased the organoid-formation capacity in Chir-VPA-treated WT organoids (Fig. 4 A and B). These results indicated that the lack of autophagy is more deleterious to ISCs than to differentiated cells.
To evaluate if the lack of autophagy was associated with the increased levels of cytotoxic ROS, we evaluated the amount of intracellular ROS in organoids generated from both NOD2 KO and ATG16L1 KO mice. We observed significantly higher levels in both KO when compared with WT organoids under steadystate conditions (Fig. 4C). To assess the impact of ATG16L1 on balancing ROS levels, and therefore its importance in ISC cytoprotection, we tested the survival of ATG16L1 KO organoids upon stress. Six days after XRT, MDP stimulation no longer increased the number of surviving ATG16L1 KO organoids. Since high ROS levels mediate XRT cytotoxicity (16), we tested whether the survival capacity of organoids could be restored by treatment

with the antioxidant resveratrol (Resv), known to affect mtROS in vitro (21). Upon treatment with Resv, the number of surviving organoids obtained from WT, NOD2 KO, and ATG16L1 KO mice was partially restored (Fig. 4D).
To verify if MDP may activate mitophagy by induction of ATG16L1 also without XRT, we checked for lysosome-mitochondria (autophagosome) association, as assessed by LysoTracker and MitoTracker, respectively. After MDP stimulation, we observed an increase in lysosome-mitochondria association, consistent with ATG16L1 recruitment by NOD2 and subsequent mitophagy activation. Conversely, NOD2 KO and ATG16L1 KO organoids exhibited defects in lysosome-mitochondria colocalization in both control and MDP-stimulated conditions, suggesting impairment of the mitophagy process (Fig. 4 E and F). Taken together, these results indicate that MDP induces NOD2/ATG16L1 activation, leading to mitophagy and therefore balancing intracellular ISC ROS levels.
MDP Induces Intestinal Stem Cell Mitophagy after Irradiation in Vivo. To check for the presence of genes associated with the autophagic machinery in ISCs, we performed expression analyses of a panel of autophagy-implicated genes on sorted ISCs from GFPLGR5 mice (the sorting strategy is in SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). We found an up-regulation of autophagy-pathway genes in ISCs as compared with whole epithelial crypt cells, including Atg16L1 and Ulk1 (Unc-51-like kinase 1), a downstream P-AMPK-activated autophagy-initiating kinase (Fig. 5A). Moreover, upon XRT, we observed that the Nod2 gene was the highest-induced pattern recognition receptor (PRR) in ISCs, while no change was detected in PCs, confirming our observations in vitro (Fig. 5B and SI Appendix, Fig. S3B).
To assess if MDP induces ISC autophagy in vivo, GFP-LC3 mice were subjected to antibiotic treatment to deplete the intestinal microbiota and MDP was administered before total-body irradiation. Four hours after XRT, we observed an MDPmediated increase in GFP-LC3 puncta within ISCs, stained with anti-Olfm4 antibody (Fig. 5 C and D). MDP, and not its inactive isomer MDP L-L, in the absence of XRT did not induce ISC autophagy in vivo, confirming that the cytoprotective signal is primarily activated upon stress.
To confirm the MDP-mediated induction of ISC mitophagy upon oxidative stress, we analyzed intestinal tissues by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 5E). We identified ISCs as lateral neighbors of PCs, located at the bottom of the crypts. In ISCs of MDP-treated, irradiated mice, we observed vacuoles filled with contents of different electron density corresponding to autolysosomes. These vacuoles were surrounded by a single membrane and part of the content had an amorphous appearance. Inside these vacuoles, we found remnants of mitochondria characterized by the presence of cristae (Fig. 5 E, Left). By contrast, the same treatment induced a drastic morphological change to the mitochondria of PCs (Fig. 5 E, Right). Compared with untreated tissue (SI Appendix, Fig. S3C), mitochondria of PCs displayed disarrangement of cristae and the mitochondrial lumen showed signs of extraction and the presence of membrane swirls. Despite morphological changes in PC mitochondria, no degradative compartments comprising mitochondria were observed. However, profiles of early autophagosomes were present in the cytosol of PCs (Fig. 5 E, Middle), characterized by the presence of membranes and ribosomes in the lumen and surrounded by a double membrane with the outer membrane devoid of ribosomes on its cytosolic side.
Discussion
We previously demonstrated in mice that the cytosolic receptor NOD2 is highly and uniquely expressed in ISCs, as opposed to all other members of the epithelial lining. We further showed that the presence of its MDP agonist, a universal building block of the

bacterial cell wall, significantly protects ISCs upon doxorubicininduced stress (ROS production) (8). Combining in vivo and ex vivo experiments utilizing intestine-derived organoids, this work established evidence for the involvement of an intestinal microbiota-associated bacterial motif in epithelial regeneration. This is regulated by MDP-induced modulation of stem cell viability and by a cytoprotective process involving the NOD2 pathway. Up to now, NOD2 has been primarily implicated as a component of the innate, NF-B-dependent, proinflammatory immune response to bacterial pathogens, as immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, are generally recognized as bona fide producers of NOD2 (22). However, a more recent publication suggests an alternative signaling route involving NOD2 and the autophagy effector ATG16L1, leading to an autophagy-mediated increase of the class II antigen presentation of bacteria-infected antigen-presenting cells (9).
In any event, the key molecular mechanism involved in MDPNOD2-mediated cytoprotection of ISCs had not yet been addressed. Hence, we established and validated an irradiation stress model of murine small intestinal organoids in order to decipher the signaling chain involved in cytoprotection. Here we show an alternative route of NOD2 signaling, comprising the active down-regulation of NF-B, to favor a pathway in which MDP activation of NOD2 leads to ATG16L1 engagement and autophagy stimulation. Autophagy in this context is primarily dominated by mitophagy, allowing for the sequestration of damaged mitochondria, which were identified as major ROS producers upon irradiation stress in ISCs.
Asano et al. (23) found that intrinsic autophagy is important for the maintenance of ISCs by reducing excessive ROS. This stem cell maintenance was necessary to provide damage-induced intestinal regeneration after an oxidative stress such as irradiation. Along similar lines, caloric restriction-induced autophagy (via mTOR inactivation) increased the numbers of LGR5+ ISCs and simultaneously promoted the survival and regeneration of intestinal crypts following exposure to radiation (24). Fasting also preserved ISCs following a strong oxidative stress with chemotherapy (25). Altogether, these studies suggest that autophagy could be implicated in ISC cellular homeostasis upon stress. It is therefore possible that XRT alone partly induces ISC autophagy due to strong ROS production.
Low-grade mitochondria-derived ROS is essential for ISC maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation; however, in excess, ROS triggers p53-mediated ISC death (17, 26). This implies the existence of a "gray zone," where physiological ROS concentrations allow for stem cell maintenance and function while an excessive ROS concentration results in cytotoxicity. This work unravels a fascinating angle of host-microbiota symbiosis whereby coevolution has harnessed NOD2, a microbial danger sensor (22), and ATG16L1, a key regulator of autophagosome maturation (27, 28), to control ROS levels to this sensitive gray zone during ISC stress. On the one hand, reducing ROS levels helps to preserve ISC survival, thereby having a positive impact on epithelial regeneration upon immediate stress conditions including infection, exposure to food toxins, nutritional factors, and xenobiotics. On the other hand, long-term events, like in the case of intestinal dysbiosis, may alter the symbiotic balance and lead to deficient provision of MDP, and thus to delayed epithelial repair following alteration. This hypothesis is supported by the dominance of NOD2 and ATG16L1 "loss-of-function" polymorphisms among the numerous polymorphisms identified in Crohn's disease patients by genome-wide association studies in patients suspected of a genetically transmitted trait (29). Alternatively, excessive expression of this symbiotic function may alter ISC "quality control" and prevent p53-mediated cell death, which may result in the dangerous accumulation of somatic mutations upon stress-induced DNA breaks and the increased risk for cancer stem cell development (30). This emphasizes the urgent need for technological

breakthroughs allowing for the measurement of MDP concentrations in intestinal crypts at homeostasis and in pathological conditions. Taken together, in the ISCs, NOD2 stimulation with MDP results in the activation of the autophagic pathway as opposed to the canonical induction of cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial genes.
Due to their location, ISCs are more protected from invasive bacteria when compared with other epithelial cells. Moreover, additional PRRs are still expressed by ISCs, including NOD1. Therefore, we could hypothesize that in ISCs, NOD2 has a shift of function, representing a receptor responding to "good" stimuli from commensal bacteria to counter stress signals, while NOD1 mediates host-pathogen responses.
In this study, we show a link between mitophagy-mediated ROS clearance and bacterial MDP stimulation in ISCs, thereby linking microbiota and epithelial regeneration (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). This may provide a novel angle to understanding the pathophysiology of Crohn's disease and new prospects for translation into clinical practice for patients receiving oxidative-generating anticancer agents.
Methods
Mice. Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 (GFP-LGR5) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories. Card15/Nod2-deficient C57BL/6J (NOD2 KO) mice were provided by J.-P. Hugot, Hpital Robert Debr, Paris, France (31). GFP-LGR5 mice were crossed with ROSAmT/mG (mTmG) Cre reporter mice (provided by Institut Pasteur) (32) to obtain GFP-LGR5;mTmG mice. C57BL/6N ATG16L1flox/floxvillin-Cre (ATG16L1 KO) mice were provided by H.W.V. (33) and C57BL/6J-Tg(CAG-EGFP/ Map1lc3b)53Nmz (GFP-LC3) tg mice (34) were provided by Institut Pasteur. In each experiment, age- and sex-matched mice were used as controls and were nonlittermates in some experiments. All mice were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions and all animal experiments were carried out under approval by the Animal Care and Use Commitee of Institut Pasteur and by the French Ministry of Agriculture (2016-0022). For the detection of ROS generation, mice were given a single i.p. injection of 100 L 12.5 M ROSstar 550 (Li-Cor) for 30 min. The depletion of the microbiota was performed as previously described (8, 35). Briefly, water flasks were supplemented with 1 g/L ampicillin (Sigma) and mice were gavaged every day for 10 d with 200 L of a freshly made mixture of the following antibiotics: 10 mg/mL metronidazole (Sigma), 5 mg/mL vancomycin (Acros), 5 mg/mL neomycin (Sigma), and 0.1 mg/mL amphotericin B (Pan-Biotech).
Five days before irradiation, 100 M MDP or inactive MDP L-L isomer (InvivoGen) was added to the drinking water (50 g/mL) and 200 g of the specific compounds was given daily by gavage. For all experiments at least 5 animals per condition were used.
Crypt Isolation and Organoid Formation. Intestinal crypts were extracted as previously described (8). The intestines were flushed and treated with bleach to remove any possible contamination from the luminal bacteria. To ensure MAMP enclosure into the organoids, lumen and size homogeneity organoid assays were always performed from isolated crypts. Two hundred and fifty crypts (generating roughly 150 organoids) were centrifuged and the following MAMPs were added or not and let stand for 10 min at room temperature before embedding: 10 g/mL soluble sonicated peptidoglycan from E. coli K12 (PGN), 10 g/mL N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP), 10 g/mL lipopolysaccharide from E. coli O111:B4, 500 ng/mL lipoprotein (Pam3), 10 ng/mL S. enterica ser. Thyphimurium flagellin, 1 M synthetic unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, or 10 g/mL L-Ala--D-Glu-mDAP (Tridap) (all from InvivoGen). The crypts were then embedded in 30 L growth factorreduced Matrigel (Corning), seeded in 48-well plates, incubated for 20 min at 37 캜, and overloaded with 300 L of crypt medium as previously described (8). The medium was exchanged every 4 d. If needed, medium was supplemented with CHIR99021 (3 M; Stemgent) and valproic acid (1 mM; Sigma-Aldrich) over the course of 72 h to enrich organoids with stem cells (20). Organoids were recovered using Cell Recovery Solution (Corning) at 4 캜 for 15 min to dissolve the Matrigel, followed by 3 washes of the pelleted cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (1 M; Sigma-Aldrich) was added in GFP-LGR5;mTmG crypt media to induce activation of CreERT2 and consequently excision of the tdTomato-pA cassette (36).

Flow Cytometric Analysis and Sorting. Isolated crypts from GFP-LGR5 mice were incubated in HBSS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ supplemented with 0.3 U/mL Dispase (Corning), 0.8 U/L DNase (Sigma), and 10 M Y-27632 (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 캜. For cell sorting, dissociated cells were washed with 1% BSA/PBS and stained with CD24-APC antibody (1:20; BioLegend; M1/69) and EpCam Pe-Cy7 (1:100; BioLegend; G8.8) for 20 min at 4 캜. The cells were then resuspended in crypt media supplemented with 10 M Y-27632, filtered with a 35-m mesh, and analyzed by MoFlo Astrios (Beckman Coulter). Sorted cells were collected in RLT buffer (Qiagen). For flow cytometric analysis, GFPLGR5 or ATG16L1 KO organoids were removed from the Matrigel with Cell Recovery Solution (Corning), dissociated with Dispase solution (as for the isolated crypts), stained, and acquired on a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) or an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher) and analyzed by FlowJo software (Tree Star). GFP-LGR5 ISC concentration was measured using CountBright absolute counting beads (Thermo Fisher).
Real-Time PCR. Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini or Micro Kit (Qiagen) and the complementary (c)DNA was made with SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher) and oligo(dT)12 to 18 primer (Thermo Fisher) as recommended by the suppliers. The primers (Bio-Rad) and probes (TaqMan Assays; Thermo Fisher) are listed in SI Appendix, Table S1. Reactions were run on a QuantStudio 7 (Thermo Fisher) using Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher) or TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For GFPhighCD24middle sorted-cell gene expression analysis, 20 ng of cDNA from each condition was preamplified using the TaqMan Preamp Master Mix Kit (Thermo Fisher). After preamplification, samples were diluted 1:20 before high-throughput microfluidic real-time PCR analysis. Amplified cDNA samples were assayed for gene expression using individual real-time (RT)-PCR primers and 96.96 dynamic arrays on a BioMark System by following the manufacturer's protocol (Fluidigm). Beta2-microglobulin was used as a housekeeping gene and 2-Ct (cycle threshold) values were calculated to obtain relative expression as compared with RNA extracted from whole epithelial crypt cells.
Radiation. For the irradiation-injury studies, organoids (in vitro XRT) received 2 Gy with exception of the incremental irradiation doses (SI Appendix, Fig. S1) and mice (in vivo XRT) received 12-Gy whole-body irradiation using an Xstrahl 320 irradiator (Camberley). Mice were euthanized 4 h after treatment.
Imaging Detection. For confocal laser-scanning microscopy, the organoids or the tissue was fixed and embedded in agarose or in OCT compound 4583 (Sakura) as already described (37). Sections of 150 m (agarose) or 10 m (OCT) were obtained by using an HM650V vibratome (Thermo Fisher) or a CM3050S cryostat (Leica), respectively. For antigen retrieval, slides were steamed for 20 min in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6) and cooled for 30 min. Rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology; Asp175), chicken anti-GFP (1:500; Abcam; ab13970), rabbit anti-LC3B (1:200; Abgent; AP1802a), rabbit anti-p65 (1:100; Abcam; 7970), mouse anti-Olfm4 (1:200; Cell Signaling Technology; D6Y5A), phalloidin 568 (Thermo Fisher), and corresponding secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488, 568, or 647; Thermo Fisher) were used. DNA was stained by DAPI (1 g/mL; Thermo Fisher). The sections were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Thermo Fisher). Images were acquired using an IX-81 (Olympus) or Opterra swept-field confocal microscope (Bruker) equipped with thermic chamber and CO2 control. Postacquisition image analysis was performed with Fiji 2.0.0 software.
Measurement of Intracellular ROS. Total intracellular ROS and mitochondrial ROS were measured by flow cytometry (cf. Flow Cytometric Analysis and Sorting above; the dye was added after dissociation) or live imaging. For total ROS, CellROX Deep Red (2.5 M, 30 min at 37 캜; Thermo Fisher) and ROSstar 550 (2.5 M, 30 min at 37 캜; Li-Cor) were used. For mtROS, MitoSOX Red (5 M for 30 min at 37 캜; Mitochondrial Superoxide indicator; Molecular Probes) was used. For live imaging, DNA was stained with Hoechst 33342 (20 M; Thermo Fisher) and cells were washed with DMEM FluoroBrite (Gibco). Resveratrol (40 M; Sigma) was used as an antioxidant agent and directly added to the culture media just before irradiation and during subsequent culture.
Autophagy and Mitophagy Analyses. Live organoids were incubated for 30 min at 37 캜 in the dark with 50 nM MitoTracker Deep Red and/or 50 nM LysoTracker (both from Thermo Fisher). DNA staining and washes were performed as described above. Bafilomycin A1 (Sigma) was added to the culture media for organoid-formation efficiency tests at a concentration of 100 nM as determined by a dose-response study (SI Appendix, Fig. S2D).

Increased LC3 concentration on the membrane provided a stronger signal, as was previously reported (12). Images of GFP-LC3 sections were collected using confocal microscopy. The z-stack images were collected and the GFP signals were analyzed through the sections. Using Fiji, the percentage of LC3GFP-positive cells on different organoid domains (crypt-like versus villus-like domains) was assessed (Fig. 3B).
Transmission Electron Microscopy. Mice were euthanized, the intestine was extracted, and small pieces were fixed by immersion in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (EMS) in PHEM buffer (pH 7.2) at room temperature. Samples were postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide + 0.8% ferricyanide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) and dehydrated by an ethanol series followed by propylene oxide before gradual infiltration with EPON resin. After heat polymerization, thin sections were cut and picked up on carbon/formvar-coated slot grids. Images were taken with a Tecnai G2 microscope operated at 120 kV equipped with a Gatan US 4000 CCD camera.
ELISA. Murine CXCL1 assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols (R&D Biosystems; DY453-05). After 3 d of organoid culture, XRT or recombinant murine TNF (100 ng/mL; PeproTech) (used as positive control) was applied, and the supernatant was recovered after 24 h (at D4).

Statistical Analysis. The descriptive statistical analysis was performed with Prism version 7 (GraphPad Software). Results are expressed as means  SD of at least n = 3 replicates. Statistical comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

The bacterium Clostridium perfringens causes severe, sometimes lethal gastrointestinal disorders in humans, including enteritis and enterotoxemia. Type F strains produce an enterotoxin (CpE) that causes the third most common foodborne illness in the United States. CpE induces gut breakdown by disrupting barriers at cell-cell contacts called tight junctions (TJs), which are formed and maintained by claudins. Targeted binding of CpE to specific claudins, encoded by its C-terminal domain (cCpE), loosens TJ barriers to trigger molecular leaks between cells. Cytotoxicity results from claudin-bound CpE complexes forming pores in cell membranes. In mammalian tissues, 24 claudins govern TJ barriers--but the basis for CpE's selective targeting of claudins in the gut was undetermined. We report the structure of human claudin-4 in complex with cCpE, which reveals that enterotoxin targets a motif conserved in receptive claudins and how the motif imparts high-affinity CpE binding to these but not other subtypes. The structural basis of CpE targeting is supported by binding affinities, kinetics, and half-lives of claudin-enterotoxin complexes and by the cytotoxic effects of CpE on claudin-expressing cells. By correlating the binding residence times of claudin-CpE complexes we determined to claudin expression patterns in the gut, we uncover that the primary CpE receptors differ in mice and humans due to sequence changes in the target motif. These findings provide the molecular and structural element CpE employs for subtype-specific targeting of claudins during pathogenicity of C. perfringens in the gut and a framework for new strategies to treat CpE-based illnesses in domesticated mammals and humans.

to 4 and links TM1 to TM2, while ECS2 contains 5 and links TM3 to TM4. Claudin TM and ECS domains interact laterally in cis (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B) and perpendicularly in trans, forming permselective barriers to ions while simultaneously adhering adjacent cells. Both interaction types serve as the foundation for TJ ultrastructure and function (13, 14).
CpE may disrupt gut integrity through toxin-induced dissociation of claudin cis and trans interactions, leading to breakdown of TJ barrier function, in addition to killing epithelial cells via a claudin-bound ion pore (9, 10, 12). The gastrointestinal-specific expression of a claudin is not requisite for CpE binding, however, as subtypes with no to low gut abundance bind CpE due to claudin sequence and structural conservation (9, 12, 15). Yet, sufficient sequence and structure divergence exists to impart only select subtypes the ability to bind CpE (16, 17). The recalcitrant nature of claudins to in vitro and in vivo biochemical and biophysical study has yielded contradictory findings concerning which subtypes are physiological CpE receptors, and a lack of quantitative data on claudin-CpE interactions obscures the subtle structural differences that must arise in receptor and nonreceptor claudins (16).
Claudin-3 and -4 were the first CpE receptors identified in humans and mice (4, 5). In the gut of these mammals, expression patterns and levels of claudin-3 and -4 vary (15, 18). In humans, CpE incidence in the small intestine causes morphological tissue damage and a reduction in TJ barrier integrity in vitro, while

Significance

Type F isolates of the pathogenic gram-positive bacterium Clostridium perfringens secrete an enterotoxin (CpE) that afflicts humans and other mammals with very common foodborne and antibiotic-associated forms of gastrointestinal disease, and in some cases severe or fatal enterotoxemia (1, 2). In C. perfringens, sporulation triggers expression and release of CpE into the gastrointestinal tract of its host, where it binds to its cell-surface receptor and induces breakdown of the gastrointestinal barrier and cytotoxicity (1). CpE is 35 kDa in size, has structural homology to -barrel pore-forming toxins (3), and recognizes and binds its receptors via its C-terminal domain (cCpE) (4, 5). The process of gastrointestinal breakdown in humans initiates with CpE binding to claudins--a 27-member family of plasma membrane proteins that assemble to fortify tight junctions (TJs) in epithelia (Fig. 1A)--and culminates with claudin-bound CpE oligomers that dissociate TJs and form transcellular ion pores that ultimately induce cell death (6).
Human claudins range in size from 23 to 34 kDa and are classified by a conserved WGLWCC motif. The 13 "classic" human claudins have additional homology outside of this motif and share 30 to 71% sequence identity (SI Appendix, Fig. S1) (7). Claudins have conserved structural topologies that consist of four -helical transmembrane (TM) segments and two extracellular segments (ECSs) that form from a five-stranded antiparallel -sheet (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A) (8-12). ECS1 contains -strands 1

Clostridium perfringens causes gas gangrene and is a leading cause of bacterial food poisoning, with 1,000,000 US cases annually. Food-poisoning strains produce an enterotoxin (CpE) that breaks apart tight junctions, protein assemblies composed of claudins that fortify the gut barrier. CpE selectively targets claudins via its C-terminal domain (cCpE) to disrupt the gut barrier--the basis for targeting was unknown. Here, we determine the structure of cCpE bound to human claudin-4, discover the structural origin of CpE targeting, and reveal that the primary CpE receptors differ in mice and humans. These insights elucidate CpE's mechanism for selective targeting of claudins in mammalian gut and can be applied to aid design of new CpE-based therapeutics to treat claudin-linked diseases.

subtypes as receptors or nonreceptors for CpE using our current understanding.
The structure of human claudin-4 (hCLDN-4) in complex with cCpE allows us to define the features CpE employs for claudin subtype-specific targeting and its action on claudins in cells. Altered in vivo expression patterns of human and mouse claudins, coupled with a lack of biophysical binding data, led us to characterize and quantify CpE's ability to recognize, bind, and destroy claudin-expressing cells to resolve the structural and functional consequences of CpE targeting. Using these findings, we identify divergence in claudin-CpE binding interactions that explains subtype-specific targeting by CpE and how this process influences cytotoxicity. Our discoveries advance categorization of claudin receptors and nonreceptors for CpE in mammalian gut, and elucidate the molecular mechanism by which CpE prompts targeted dissociation of claudins and the breakdown of TJ barriers.
Results
Structure of hCLDN-4. The structure of hCLDN-4 in complex with cCpE was resolved at 3.37  (SI Appendix, Table S1). The hCLDN-4 portion includes residues 5 to 186 and contains the four--helix bundle TM domain and five-stranded antiparallel -sheet that comprise the two ECSs, hallmarks of the claudin fold (Fig. 1B). TM3 extends outside of the membrane forming an extracellular helix (ECH), ECH2, and four extracellular loops (ECLs) connect sequentially structured subdomains. The two ECSs of hCLDN-4 resemble a left "hand" with five "fingers"-- ECH2 as the "thumb" and 5, 1, 2, and disulfide-linked 3-4 following along in order--and are presented as a "cupped hand" to create a large surface for enterotoxin binding (Fig. 1B).
The hCLDN-4 structure lacks a fully formed ECH1 like other claudins bound to cCpE (8-10, 12). ECH1 is a helix in ECL3 involved in claudin cis assembly and is found in the unbound structure of mouse claudin-15 (mCLDN-15) (11, 20, 21). In hCLDN-4, electron density in the ECH1 region appears bulbous and the loop has helical / values at the N terminus of the SLLALP74 sequence that constitutes it (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A). Structural comparison of hCLDN-4's ECH1 region with the same area in cCpE-bound hCLDN-9 shows differences despite the two subtypes having identical SLLALP74 sequences, while contrasting these subtypes with mCLDN-15 highlights the effect of cCpE binding (SI Appendix, Fig. S4B). ECH1 is unstructured in both cCpE-bound hCLDN-4 and -9 but helical in mCLDN-15. We performed sequence analysis of the ECH1 region in classic claudins to decipher if homology exists (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). We hypothesized that homology would suggest ECH1's natural formation in claudins and that its inability to form in hCLDN-4 is a result of cCpE binding. This prediction is required because no unbound structures of hCLDN-4 or -9 are available. Sequence alignments show 33 to 83% residue identity in this range and that the consensus sequence for ECH1 in classic claudins is SLLALP74 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4C). SLLALP74 is present in 6 of 13 classic claudins, including hCLDN-4, indicating ECH1 is likely structured in cCpE's absence. The SLLALP74 helix is hydrophobic with a predicted aliphatic index of 211.7 and grand average of hydropathicity of 1.8. With its bulbous density and helical nature, the SLLALP74 region of hCLDN-4 may represent a helical remnant of ECH1 after disruption by cCpE. Prompting structural plasticity of ECH1 could be how enterotoxin disables claudin lateral assemblies, as recognized side-chain interactions that enable cis homodimers are abrogated after cCpE binding (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B).
Structure of the hCLDN-4-cCpE Complex. The cCpE binds target claudins while the N-terminal domain oligomerizes to form cytotoxic claudin-bound pore complexes (3, 22). Structure of the hCLDN-4-cCpE complex shows 1:1 stoichiometry in the crystal and packing of a single complex in the asymmetric unit (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). The hCLDN-4-cCpE complex is intricately associated with

cCpE contacting all five fingers and resting within the extracellular cupped hand of hCLDN-4 (Fig. 2). ECS2 contains an NPLVA153 motif that penetrates a groove between -strands of cCpE, while ECS1 contacts cCpE's surface (Fig. 2 A and B). Most ECS interactions with cCpE occur at the periphery of the claudin fingers, which creates a solvent-accessible pocket at the intermolecular interface near the "palm" (Fig. 2C). The size and shape of this pocket are influenced by unique interactions between hCLDN-4 and cCpE.
Intermolecular ion pairs and nonpolar and polar interactions coordinate the hCLDN-4-cCpE complex and define the molecular determinants for cCpE targeting of claudins. In the ECS1 and ECS2 of hCLDN-4, nine and eight residues, respectively, establish the primary interactions with cCpE (SI Appendix, Figs. S6 and S7). Structural analysis of the complex reveals an elaborate hydrogen-bonding network in hCLDN-4 that extends from the membrane boundary of TM3 and leads to the NPLVA153 motif (Fig. 3). This network utilizes residues from hCLDN-4 and cCpE, and includes many of the side chains that form the major polar interactions in the complex (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). The hCLDN-4 portion of the network, which we term the "cCpEbinding motif," contains 12 residues--Arg31, Thr33, Glu48, Asp76, Trp138, His141, Asn142, Asp146, Pro150, Leu151, Gln156, and Arg158. The network starts at Ne1 of hCLDN-4 Trp138 and connects to Asn142, Asp76, Arg31, Glu48, Arg158, Asp225 (cCpE), Arg227 (cCpE), Asp146, Gln156, Ser313 (cCpE), Leu151, and Ser256 (cCpE), and ends at the carbonyl oxygen of Pro150 (Fig. 3A). Sequence alignment of these residues in gut-expressing claudins shows homology in mouse and human subtypes (Fig. 3B). The core of this interaction network is ionically driven and centers at Arg158 of hCLDN-4. Arg158 is sandwiched between hCLDN-4 Arg31 and cCpE Arg227, forming a string of stacked arginines with C-C distances of 3.5 and 3.8 , respectively (Fig. 3C). These C distances are in agreement with those from high-resolution crystal structures with arginine stacking (23). Acidic residues Glu48, Asp76, and Asp146 of hCLDN-4 and Asp225 of cCpE surround the three arginines, forming ionic intra- and intermolecular interactions that stabilize the arginine stack conformations (Fig. 3 A and C). The three acidic residues are well-conserved in gut-expressing claudins (Fig. 3B). The ionic core residues inhabit the solvent-accessible pocket at the hCLDN-4-cCpE interface (Figs. 2C and 3C), illustrating that water, disordered in the structure, may enable its formation and maintenance. The hydrogen-bonding network ends at Phe35, which forms nonpolar interactions with two leucines of cCpE. The structure of the hCLDN-4-cCpE complex agrees with other studies showing both ECSs support cCpE binding--but provides salient details that illustrate residues inside and outside of ECS2 are co-opted by cCpE for subtypespecific targeting.
Sequence Analyses of cCpE-Binding Motif Residues. We investigated whether sequence and structural conservation of this hydrogenbonding network in claudins could explain selective targeting by cCpE. Alignment of gut-expressing mouse and human claudin sequences shows 8 to 92% identity in the 12-amino acid cCpEbinding motif, indicating divergence in certain subtypes (Fig. 3B). While it was known that not all subtypes express highly in the gut of mice and humans (15, 18), the receptive capacities of many gut claudins were unknown. Alignment analysis of the cCpE-binding motif in the characteristic CpE receptors CLDN-3 and -4 reveals 67 to 92% residue identity in the four mouse and human subtypes--signifying high conservation and receptor potential. In CLDN-3 and -4 the most diversity appears at Leu151, position 3 in the NPLVA153 motif of hCLDN-4, where side-chain hydrophobic lengths vary from valine, leucine, to methionine (Fig. 3B). We further examine the position 3 residue and the NPLVA153 motif using structural and biophysical methods to decipher their roles in enterotoxin binding and subtype-specific targeting.

Affinities and Kinetics of Claudin-Enterotoxin Complexes. We performed comparative structural analyses between hCLDN4-cCpE and five other claudin-cCpE complexes comprising three different subtypes (SI Appendix, Results and Discussion and Figs. S8-S11). These analyses show that cCpE poses vary widely when bound to specific subtypes (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). But, these variations are qualitative and difficult to relate to in vivo function. We therefore performed biophysical measurements on mouse and human claudin-enterotoxin complexes using biolayer interferometry (BLI) to quantitate these structural differences and determine a role for the NPLVA153 motif in binding (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S12). BLI measurements show that 1) hCLDN-4 binds cCpE with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 2.5 nM, which agrees with a reported KD of 3.4 nM

measured by surface plasmon resonance (24); 2) hCLDN-4 has 100-fold higher affinity for cCpE than hCLDN-3; and 3) hCLDN-4 has a 4-fold higher cCpE affinity compared with mCLDN-3--therefore mCLDN-3 has 26-fold higher affinity for cCpE than hCLDN-3. Measurements with CpE demonstrate similar trends, owing to its N terminus playing little role in binding (Table 1). These findings establish enterotoxin binding affinities to previously undetermined mouse and human claudins and provide a quantitative approach to interpret qualitative cCpE binding poses from crystal structures of claudin-cCpE complexes (8-10, 12).
The basis for hCLDN-3-expressing cells exhibiting lower CpE binding capacities compared with hCLDN-4 was unresolved (4, 22). Comparing the affinities of enterotoxin to hCLDN-3 and

Bonds and side chains are shown as in A with addition of nonpolar interactions (gray, dash) around Phe35.
hCLDN-4 shows stark differences, while similar affinities exist for mCLDN-3 and hCLDN-4. We investigated the root of these variances by assessing sequence alignments of mouse and human claudins that are overabundant in the gut (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Position 3 of potential receptors varies--hCLDN-3 has NPVVP152, hCLDN-4 has NPLVA153, and mCLDN-3 has NPLVP152. We hypothesized changes to these residues accounted for the

contrasting receptor capacities of claudins. Swapping these
motifs by mutating two of the five residues in hCLDN-3 and -4
and assessing enterotoxin binding show that 1) an hCLDN-3
V150L/P152A mutant increases cCpE affinity 12-fold com-
pared with wild-type hCLDN-3; and 2) an hCLDN-4 L151V/
A153P mutant decreases cCpE affinity 5-fold compared with
wild-type hCLDN-4 (Table 1). With further measurements of this motif's influence on cCpE affinity using hCLDN-1, which has a DPMTP154 sequence and disputed CpE receptor capacity (17, 25-27), we find a KD of 936 nM--381-fold lower than hCLDN-4. As before, BLI measurements show CpE binding to
these mutant and wild-type claudins results in comparable
trends (Table 1). These results clarify the role of position 3 side-chain length and the NPLVA153 motif in enterotoxin
binding and begin to elucidate the origin of varied CpE re-
ceptive capacities in claudin-expressing cells. Using BLI, we established the kinetics of claudin-enterotoxin
binding by obtaining the second-order association rate constants (kons), first-order dissociation rate constants (koffs), and halflives (t1/2s) of the protein complexes (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S12). The kons for cCpE and claudins show no more than 4-fold differences, while koffs vary up to 150-fold between tested claudins, demonstrating that koff influences KD significantly (Table 1). The koff of cCpE to hCLDN-4 is 30- and 4-fold less than hCLDN-3 and mCLDN-3, respectively, accounting for hCLDN-4's higher affinity. Mutant hCLDN-3V150L/P152A decreases koff 13-fold compared with wild-type hCLDN-3 while hCLDN-4L151V/A153P increases koff 4-fold compared with wildtype hCLDN-4, indicating that leucine at position 3 of the NPLVA153 motif improves affinity. The koff of cCpE to hCLDN1 is 150-fold faster than hCLDN-4. The claudin-cCpE complex t1/2 (ln 2/koff) is the time at which half of the initially present complexes have dissociated. Comparing the t1/2 of cCpE with hCLDN-3 and hCLDN-4 indicates that hCLDN-4 maintains a
complex with cCpE 30 times longer. mCLDN-3 binds cCpE 8 times longer than hCLDN-3. Mutant hCLDN-3V150L/P152A
bound cCpE 13 times longer than wild-type hCLDN-3 while hCLDN-4L151V/A153P bound cCpE 4 times shorter than wild-type
hCLDN-4, verifying that a position 3 leucine extends complex half-lives. The t1/2 between cCpE and hCLDN-1 was 45 s. Similar association and dissociation rate constants and t1/2 times were measured for claudin complexes with CpE (Table 1). These re-
sults offer a function for the position 3 leucine in enterotoxin
binding, and provide a means to distinguish CpE receptors from

nonreceptors in a physiological context based on the stark differences in claudin-enterotoxin kinetics.
Peripheral Expression of Claudins Renders Insect Cells Susceptible to CpE Cytotoxicity. We next investigated the cellular consequences of claudin-enterotoxin complex formation ex vivo, which for CpE-induced cytotoxicity requires CpE binding to claudins and pore assembly on cellular surfaces. Sf9 cells are a model system because they lack TJs and endogenous claudins (28) but form TJ-like strands upon exogenous expression of claudins (11). We transduced Sf9 cells with baculoviruses containing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged claudins from our biophysical studies, and then treated individual wells with no toxin, cCpE, or CpE (Fig. 4). Claudin-expressing cells treated with CpE and not cCpE, which lacks a cytotoxic N-terminal domain, exhibit specific morphological changes. Changes in morphology upon CpE treatment consist of more numerous large swollen and small flattened cells and loss to plasma membrane fluorescence (Fig. 4 C-I). This cellular response is not seen in nontransduced Sf9 cells, or Sf9 cells transduced with a nonclaudin membrane protein (PMP) treated with CpE, demonstrating morphological damage is both CpE- and claudin-dependent (Fig. 4 A and B). The extent of morphological damage is indistinguishable in all claudins tested, indicating claudin localization to the plasma membrane rendered Sf9 cells sensitive to CpE. Moreover, plasma membrane localization of claudins did not change upon treatment with cCpE even after 12 h, departing from results in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (Fig. 4 C-I) (22). Injury to hCLDN-1-expressing cells treated with CpE was seen, despite 1.4 M affinity (Fig. 4I). Our findings indicate that morphological damage to claudin-expressing cells after CpE treatment is a result of CpE-induced cytotoxicity via pore assembly on cell surfaces.
To verify that morphological damage correlates to cell death, we quantified the viability of toxin-treated cells. For cells transduced with baculovirus but not treated with toxin (Fig. 4A), we measure an average 22% decrease in cell viability, which represents normal infectivity after 48-h incubation with high-titer baculoviruses (Fig. 5A). These measurements show that only cells expressing claudins and treated with CpE undergo cell death, verifying that morphological damage signifies dead or dying cells (Fig. 4 C-I). No cell death occurs in nontransduced Sf9 cells, Sf9 cells expressing PMP treated with CpE or cCpE, or claudin-expressing cells treated with cCpE (Fig. 5A). Cytotoxicity therefore requires both CpE and peripherally expressed claudins. CpE decreases viability of claudin-expressing cells an average of 58.5% compared with cells treated with no toxin, and 57.9% compared with cells treated with cCpE. This similar decrease confirms cCpE has no cytotoxic effect. hCLDN-1, which was shown to be CpE-resistant (22, 27) or slightly CpE-sensitive (26) in other cell types, exhibits CpE-induced cell death equal to other claudins (Fig. 5A). Our cell-based cytotoxicity assays verify that CpE does not require accessory claudins or other TJassociated proteins to form functional pore complexes on cell surfaces, and that peripheral expression of claudins renders insect cells susceptible to CpE cytotoxicity.
Claudin-cCpE Complexes Are Intact on Insect Cell Surfaces. Because BLI measurements reveal subtype-specific kinetic values and plasma membrane localization of claudins does not change upon cCpE treatment, we assessed the degree of cCpE binding to claudins exposed on insect cell surfaces. Cells expressing GFPtagged claudins from the cytotoxic assay were harvested, and claudins were detergent-solubilized, ultracentrifuged, and then subjected to fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC) (29) within 2 h, the approximate t1/2 of the hCLDN4-cCpE complex (Table 1). Comparison of FSEC traces from claudin-expressing cells not treated with toxin with cells treated

with cCpE shows that cells expressing hCLDN-4, mCLDN-3, mCLDN-4, and hCLDN-4L151V/A153P maintain a complex with cCpE as indicated by decreases in peak elution times (Fig. 5 B and C). No change in peak elution times was seen for hCLDN-1 and hCLDN-3, signifying an inability to preserve a complex with cCpE (Fig. 5C). hCLDN-3V150L/P152A was not tested as we have no GFP-fused construct. Next, we tested if shifts in peak elution times from FSEC correspond to cCpE binding to claudins by taking supernatant from cells not treated with toxin, adding exogenous pure cCpE, and running FSEC. FSEC shows that these in vitro formed claudin-cCpE complexes elute at the same time as complexes formed ex vivo and extracted from insect cell membranes (Fig. 5 B and C). This observation verifies that cCpE remains bound to surface-exposed detergent-solubilized claudins, and that this cCpE binding accounts for the nonexogenous FSEC peak shifts. Using FSEC, we confirm that cCpE binds hCLDN-4, mCLDN-3, mCLDN-4, and hCLDN-4L151V/A153P on insect cell surfaces ex vivo and that these complexes are preserved for at least 2 h in vitro, and that cCpE complexes with hCLDN-1 and -3 are not maintained over the same period of time. Attempts to assess whether cytotoxic claudin-bound CpE pores are maintained using FSEC resulted in no fluorescence signal detected due to degradation. These biochemical results coincide with claudin-enterotoxin biophysical measurements and, when taken together with our structural findings, can be used to distinguish CpE receptors from nonreceptors in a physiological context.
Discussion
The current study uncovers salient insights into the structure- function relationship between claudin subtype-specific targeting by CpE and cytotoxic complex formation at mammalian gut TJs. The hCLDN-4 structure reveals a helical remnant in the ECH1 region and sequence alignment suggests ECH1 is present and structured in classic claudins due to the conservation of SLLALP74. It has been proposed that 1) ECH1 exists in other claudins (11); 2) CpE binding to claudins abolishes this motif (8-10, 12); and 3) some ECH1 residues function in cis assembly (12, 20, 21). Our results verify that the binding of cCpE abrogates ECH1 structure and a corresponding loss of side-chain interactions at potential cis interfaces explains how cCpE may disable lateral assembly of claudins at TJs (SI Appendix, Figs. S2B and S4). The binding of cCpE to hCLDN-4 also causes helical perturbations to ECH2, which contains additional residues known to facilitate cis assembly (SI Appendix, Fig. S11) (20). The cCpE-induced disruptions to ECH1 and ECH2 provide complementary mechanisms for cCpE to disable claudin cis assemblies in order to dissociate TJs in the gut.
The structure of the hCLDN-4-cCpE complex demonstrates that both ECSs contribute to cCpE binding and reveals a cCpEbinding motif formed from a hydrogen-bonded network that is employed by cCpE for subtype-specific targeting of claudins. At the core of this network, a three-arginine stack centered at Arg157/158 mediates important hCLDN-4-cCpE polar interactions (Fig. 3). Mutations to this arginine stack affect cCpE binding. Previously, a cCpE R227A mutant decreased cCpE binding to mCLDN-3 and hCLDN-4 in vitro and in vivo while a conservative R157Y mutant in mCLDN-3 that could preserve stacking had no influence (30). Discovery of a cCpE-binding motif connects two previously disparate theories that proposed either the NPLVA153 motif or electrostatic interactions governed cCpE binding (17, 25, 26, 31). Here we show how both classes of interactions comprise the cCpE-binding motif and cooperate in cCpE binding. Importantly, the sequence of the cCpE-binding motif is highly conserved in select gut-expressing claudins and limited in others, making it a notable structural characteristic of CpE receptors (Fig. 3).

Note the peak shift in hCLDN-4, hCLDN-4L151V/A153P, mCLDN-4, and mCLDN-3 with cCpE added both ex vivo and in vitro whereas no shift occurs for hCLDN-1 or -3 under the same conditions.
Sequence and structure analyses pointed to a role for position 3 and NPLVA153 motif residues in enterotoxin selectivity so we determined its function in the processes of complex affinity and kinetics (Table 1). Measured affinities show a clear hierarchy for subtype binding, with cCpE preferring hCLDN-4 > mCLDN-3 > hCLDN-3 > hCLDN-1. These findings prove that a leucine at position 3 of the NPLVA153 motif--present in hCLDN-4 and mCLDN-3 but not hCLDN-1 or -3--significantly increases the binding affinities (KDs), slows the dissociation rate constants (koffs), and increases the half-lives (t1/2s) of claudin-enterotoxin complexes. The extended hydrophobic length of leucine versus valine more deeply penetrates a surface groove on cCpE, holding it in a different orientation, and provides a structural basis for the higher affinities of leucine-containing subtypes (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S11D). Notably, our results for hCLDN-3 contradict the presumption that it is a high-affinity CpE receptor comparable to hCLDN-4, and offers a molecular basis for the

lower CpE binding capacity of hCLDN-3-expressing cells (4, 22). Our finding that a leucine at position 3 of the NPLVA153 motif differentiates high- versus low-affinity CpE binders was verified further when swapping Val150 of hCLDN-3 for Leu151 of hCLDN-4 and vice versa, and observing that a leucine improved enterotoxin affinity for hCLDN-3 while the valine diminished it for hCLDN-4 (Table 1). This experiment also showed, however, that neither mutant achieved a level of affinity of the swapped wild-type claudin. This demonstrates that the NPLVA153 motif alone is not responsible for all processes of enterotoxin binding and that residues outside of it must play accessory yet important roles. This idea is validated by our finding that hCLDN-1, with its divergent DPMTP154 motif, binds enterotoxin and that cells expressing hCLDN-1 are killed by CpE (Fig. 4I and Table 1). We hypothesize that the 12-amino acid cCpE-binding motif, which contains 10 residues outside of the NPLVA153 motif, functions in this accessory capacity by imparting recognition and association (kon) of enterotoxin to claudins through its network of hydrogen bonds. The NPLVA153 motif and position 3 would therefore primarily direct the process of complex preservation via koff, driving KD. Conservation of cCpE-binding motif residues in classic claudins explains how cCpE recognizes and binds previously thought nonreceptors like hCLDN-1 and kills cells expressing it, while the NPLVA153 motif variation explains why we find 3.8- to 380-fold variability in enterotoxin affinities for claudins. The length of time that claudin-CpE complexes are maintained thus becomes a significant factor for whether a subtype has receptive capacity, because these individual complexes are prerequisites for multimeric CpE pore formation (6).
Because hCLDN-1 and -3 have much lower affinities, faster dissociation rate constants, and shorter complex half-lives with enterotoxin compared with hCLDN-4, we suggest neither are ideal receptors for CpE. This would appear to be contradicted by our cell-death assay but confirmed by our biochemical FSEC analyses (Figs. 4 and 5). CpE was shown to induce no or slight damage to hCLDN-1-expressing cells previously (22, 27) whereas, in our assay, cells expressing hCLDN-1 and -3 were fully prone to CpE toxicity and exhibit no changes compared with cells expressing high-affinity receptors (Figs. 4I and 5A). We attribute published differences in claudin receptive capacities to the low KDs of CpE for claudins like hCLDN-1 and -3, where using CpE below 0.4 to 1.4 M in assays would decrease binding and thus cytotoxicity. Our results indicate that at concentrations of 1.0 M in the gut, CpE could cause cytotoxicity to epithelial cells expressing claudins with poor binding capabilities. However, after extraction from cell culture, we find that hCLDN-1 and -3 fail to maintain a complex with cCpE in vitro (Fig. 5C). This result coincides with affinity and half-life measurements demonstrating that complex lifetimes can distinguish CpE receptors, and validates that hCLDN-1 and -3 are nonreceptors. This in vitro discovery appears true in vivo too, as pathophysiologically relevant CpE concentrations range from 3 to 350 nM, below CpE's KD for both hCLDN-1 and -3 (31). Our biophysical characterizations provide perspectives for distinguishing claudin receptors of CpE and uncover a role for time in CpE targeting, binding, and cytotoxicity.
To synergize our findings and identify claudin receptors for CpE, we aligned the cCpE-binding motif of mouse and human subtypes that express highly in the gut but found considerable sequence divergence (Fig. 3B). However, performing the same alignment of classic claudins regardless of tissue overexpression and then eliminating subtypes with low cCpE-binding motif conservation reveal that this motif is predictive of high-affinity CpE receptors (Fig. 6). In CLDN-3, -4, -6, -8, -9, and -17 the motif has 42 to 92% homology. Including this study, CLDN-3-, -4-, -6-, -8-, and -9-expressing cells have been shown to be susceptible to CpE cytotoxicity (12, 17, 26, 27, 31). This verifies that the cCpE-binding motif defines receptors. Our discovery of

the cCpE-binding motif in claudins coupled with the critical role of a leucine at position 3 of the NPLVA153 motif in toxin binding allows us to conclude that the high-affinity (<10 nM) CpE receptors are CLDN-3, -6, -8, and -9 in mice and CLDN-4, -6, and -9 in humans. We have shown that CpE binds hCLDN-9 with a KD of 5.1 nM and that hCLDN-9 is homologous to hCLDN-6 previously (12). By correlating these seven high-affinity subtypes to subtype expression patterns in the gut, we uncover that the primary CpE receptors for mice are CLDN-3 and -8 and for humans is CLDN-4 (Figs. 3B and 6). Because CpE demonstrates hierarchical binding preferences for individual claudins, subtypes with slight changes to position 3, like mCLDN-4 (methionine) and hCLDN-8 (isoleucine), may act as secondary receptors. Indeed, we show mCLDN-4 maintains a complex with cCpE for periods approaching hCLDN-4 and that CpE kills cells expressing it (Figs. 4F and 5A and Table 1). hCLDN-8 has been shown previously to impart CpE-mediated death to cells at concentrations below 300 nM, albeit at lower cytotoxic efficiency than hCLDN-4 (31). These findings explain the varied receptive capacities of claudin subtypes for CpE and can be applied to aid design of new cCpE- and CpE-based therapeutics to treat claudinspecific diseases in a variety of mammalian cells and tissues. Summary As the major structural elements of TJs, claudins simultaneously direct lateral cell adhesion and paracellular transport of molecules between epithelial sheets. CpE binding to claudins dissociates TJs and disrupts these dual functionalities, altering

Position 3 in the NPLVA153 motif is shown for mouse (red) and human (green) subtypes. Note the higher conservation of the motif in these claudins compared with a similar alignment in gut expressing claudins (Fig. 3B). All 12 claudins likely bind CpE, and if expressed on cell surfaces would be killed by CpE. But only subtypes with a leucine at position 3 of the NPLVA153 motif and expressed highly in gut would constitute the CpE receptors in mice (red, star) and humans (green, star).

gastrointestinal homeostasis. The mechanism of claudin-specific targeting by CpE was unresolved. Deciphering this process is vital to remedy CpE-induced foodborne disease and for structure-guided design of cCpE-based therapeutics aimed at modulating TJ barriers. This work elucidates the structural basis for CpE subtype-specific targeting of claudins by uncovering a toxin-binding motif that CpE employs to recognize, bind, and maintain a complex with claudins. Although CpE recognizes and binds claudins broadly, only select subtypes bind with sufficient affinity to preserve a complex with CpE long enough to impart cytotoxicity. These subtypes possess high homology in toxinbinding motif residues, are experimentally verified high-affinity CpE binders, and are thus probable receptors for CpE. Using our characterization of these subtypes in conjunction with claudin expression levels in the gut, we provide evidence that the primary CpE receptors--CLDN-3 in mice and CLDN-4 in humans--have diverged. The CpE concentrations known to induce pathophysiological damage to gut agree with our structuraland biophysical-based classification of receptors. During various physiological processes, remodeling of TJs in gut or its subtissues may display TJs composed of different subtypes in the apical and subapical layers (32). For CpE to be effective in these scenarios for targeted disruption of TJs, it would exploit the conserved toxin-binding motifs of multiple subtypes with ranges of receptive capacities. CpE has likely coevolved with this select group of classic claudins in mammals as a way to combat their dynamic and heterogeneous reintegration into TJs. Our study provides support that 1) CpE exploits subtype-specific features of claudins but also generally recognizes the conserved claudin fold; 2) hierarchical binding preferences allow some subtypes at low concentrations (<10 nM) and others at higher concentrations (>300 nM) to produce gastrointestinal disease; and 3) unaltered cCpEor CpE-based therapeutics aimed to target specific claudins and pathologies will likely lack intended specificity. These molecules may trigger unintended side effects in normal tissues, so thorough and off-target analyses are warranted in efforts to design and test them. Further elucidation of the claudin-bound and pore-forming processes that occur during CpE cytotoxicity of epithelial tissues will help inform these endeavors.
Materials and Methods
Protein Expression and Purification. Plasmid pFastBac1 encoding wild-type and mutant claudins, cCpE, CpE, and PMP was expressed in insect cells. For claudins, membranes were solubilized in 1% (weight/volume) n-undecyl--D-maltopyranoside (UDM). All proteins were purified via immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC) with NiNTA and resin was captured, washed, and treated with thrombin. Cleaved proteins were eluted and then used for binding, cytotoxicity, and crystallization assays. IMAC-purified hCLDN-4 and cCpE were mixed, incubated at 4 캜, concentrated, and loaded onto a SEC column. Peak fractions from the complex were pooled, concentrated to 15 mg/mL, and used for crystallization. More detailed procedures are described in SI Appendix, Methods.
Crystallization and Structure Determination. Crystals grew from a mother liquor containing 100 mM DL-malic acid, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, Tris base (1:2:2, pH 6.0), and 25% polyethylene glycol 1500. Crystals were cryoprotected with oil and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data from a single crystal were collected at Advanced Light Source beamline 8.3.1 and processed in space group P212121, and the structure was determined by molecular replacement using a poly-Ala model of hCLDN-9 bound to cCpE (12) as search model. SI Appendix, Table S1 shows data and refinement statistics with further details given in SI Appendix, Methods.
Claudin-Enterotoxin Affinity and Kinetics Using BLI. IMAC-pure CpE- and cCpEHis10 were immobilized on NiNTA or anti-His (HIS2) biosensors and BLI was performed using an Octet RED384 System (FortBIO). Kinetics experiments included a wash, toxin loading, baseline, and association and dissociation steps. During association, toxins were incubated with 0 to 250 or 0 to 2,000 nM free claudins depending on claudin-toxin affinity. Data from at least duplicate trials were analyzed, modeled, and fit. More detailed procedures are described in SI Appendix, Methods.

Cytotoxicity and Microscopy. Baculoviruses containing GFP-tagged or untagged claudins and PMP were added to adherent Sf9 cells in a 24-well plate and then placed at 27 캜. After 36 h, no toxin (untreated) or IMAC-pure cCpE and CpE were each added to the medium of two individual wells and placed back at 27 캜 for 12 h. Morphological damage of Sf9 cells was assessed with a combination of light and fluorescence microscopy. Postimaging, cells were gently removed from the wells and stained with trypan blue. Cell viability (total live divided by total cells) was quantified in duplicate manually using a hemacytometer. Further detail is provided in SI Appendix, Methods.
Postinfection Binding Assay. Untreated and cCpE-treated Sf9 cells expressing GFP-tagged claudins from Cytotoxicity Assay were harvested, pelleted, and resuspended in 1% UDM-supplemented buffer. Proteins were solubilized for 1 h and ultracentrifuged, and then the supernatant was subjected to FSEC (29). Control samples for verifying complex formation came from untreated cells expressing GFP-claudins that were then incubated with IMAC-pure cCpE (exogenous) and monitored via FSEC. SI Appendix, Methods describes the assay in greater detail.

Repeat sequences limit the effectiveness of lateral gene transfer and favored the evolution of meiotic sex in early eukaryotes

The transition from prokaryotic lateral gene transfer to eukaryotic meiotic sex is poorly understood. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that it was tightly linked to eukaryogenesis, which involved an unprecedented rise in both genome size and the density of genetic repeats. Expansion of genome size raised the severity of Muller's ratchet, while limiting the effectiveness of lateral gene transfer (LGT) at purging deleterious mutations. In principle, an increase in recombination length combined with higher rates of LGT could solve this problem. Here, we show using a computational model that this solution fails in the presence of genetic repeats prevalent in early eukaryotes. The model demonstrates that dispersed repeat sequences allow ectopic recombination, which leads to the loss of genetic information and curtails the capacity of LGT to prevent mutation accumulation. Increasing recombination length in the presence of repeat sequences exacerbates the problem. Mutational decay can only be resisted with homology along extended sequences of DNA. We conclude that the transition to homologous pairing along linear chromosomes was a key innovation in meiotic sex, which was instrumental in the expansion of eukaryotic genomes and morphological complexity.

The genes for meiosis are universal among eukaryotes, indicating that sex evolved before the divergence of the first eukaryotic clades (1, 2). It evolved from the molecular machinery for lateral gene transfer (LGT), which facilitates genetic exchange in archaea and bacteria (1, 3, 4). Prokaryotes possess homologs of the canonical molecular machinery for meiotic sex, including proteins of the SMC gene family of adenosine triphosphatases necessary for chromosome cohesion and condensation (5), as well as actin and tubulin, required for daughter cell separation and the movement of chromosomes (6). The Rad51/Dcm1 gene family, which plays a central role in meiosis, also has high protein sequence similarity with RecA, responsible for homologous search and recombination in prokaryotes (7, 8). But why eukaryotes requisitioned this existing molecular machinery to evolve a completely new mechanism of reproduction, inheritance, and genetic exchange--meiotic sex--remains obscure.
Transformation is one of the major routes of genetic exchange via LGT in bacteria and involves the acquisition of environmental DNA (eDNA), followed by recombination into the host genome (8, 9). By allowing genetic exchange between lineages, transformation can restore genes that have been disrupted through mutation or deletion (10-12), counter the effects of genetic drift and reverse Muller's ratchet (11, 13), and accelerate adaptation by reducing selective interference (14, 15). Previous modeling work has shown that the expansion of early eukaryote genome size was likely to have caused the failure of LGT (13). While LGT via transformation helps to purge deleterious mutations (11), this benefit rapidly wanes as genome size increases because of the difficulty of matching individual mutations with eDNA (13). LGT can resist mutation accumulation in larger genomes by combining more frequent recombination with increased recombination length, the mean length of DNA picked up from the environment and recombined into the host cell genome (13). But the distribution of recombination length in bacteria is skewed toward short eDNA sequences, with a median length that encompasses at most just a few genes (16-18). In addition, bacteria typically cleave eDNA, shortening recombination length. While there are constraints on the rate of uptake and recombination through limited eDNA availability and sequence homology (12, 18), prokaryotes plainly did not follow the eukaryotic trajectory toward recombination across whole chromosomes.
After the endosymbiotic event that gave rise to the first eukaryotes, the archaeal host's genome greatly expanded with genes of bacterial endosymbiotic origin and through gene duplication and divergence, which enabled a range of novel functions (19, 20). This is estimated to have doubled gene number in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA)

Significance
The origin of meiotic sex is a longstanding evolutionary enigma. This novel mechanism of reproduction replaced lateral gene transfer (LGT), the uptake and recombination of pieces of environmental DNA seen in bacteria and archaea. We link its origin to the expanded genome size and proliferation of genetic repeats found in early eukaryotes. Both factors led to high levels of mutation accumulation and gene loss under LGT, which could not be retarded through increases in the rate of LGT or the length of DNA recombined. Meiotic sex with homologous pairing of longchromosome-sized pieces of DNA promoted purifying selection and suppressed ectopic recombination. It permitted the evolution of the expanded genome needed for the evolution of complex eukaryotic life.

(21, 22). The extra energetic availability provided by the protomitochondrial endosymbiont released bioenergetic constraints over prokaryotic cell and genome size (23, 24). But this came with the cost of maintaining a larger genome (19, 21, 24, 25). Early eukaryote genome size expansion also reflected an increase in the density of repeat sequences, arising from gene duplication and the spread of mobile genetic elements (25, 26). Mobile retroelements of endosymbiotic origin are thought to have spread widely through the protoeukaryote host genome, leading to a proliferation of self-splicing introns (27-29). These selfish elements are present in many bacterial species, almost always at low copy numbers (<10 per genome) (30), but likely increased in a more uninhibited manner, perhaps exploiting the nonhomologous endjoining mechanism of DNA repair found throughout eukaryotes (31). Novel intron density is thought to have reached a density comparable to that seen in modern eukaryote species (29).
The need to restrict ectopic recombination caused by increased repeat density might have played a pivotal role in determining the evolution of meiosis (32). However, the possible involvement of such repeat sequences has not been investigated in previous quantitative models of LGT or the transition to meiotic sex (10, 11, 13). In prokaryotes, high repeat density is associated with a high probability of ectopic recombination, increasing the rates of deletions, insertions, and other genomic rearrangements (33, 34). Recombination errors caused by the presence of repeat sequences introduce an additional cost to LGT and potentially constrain the benefits of increased recombination length and LGT frequency. Here, we investigate whether the sharp increase in repeat density in early eukaryotes could have forced them to abandon LGT in favor of meiosis. To investigate this hypothesis, we develop a computational model of mutation and selection in a population undergoing LGT via transformation in the presence of genetic repeats. The model highlights a tradeoff between the benefits of LGT (greater genetic variance, enhancing purifying selection) and its cost (loss of genetic information through ectopic recombination). This leads to the view that the transition to meiotic sex was driven by the need for purifying selection in the expanding and repeatrich genomes of early eukaryotes, which could not be met by increases in recombination length or LGT rate.
Materials and Methods
We use a Fisher-Wright process with nonoverlapping generations to model the evolution of a population of N haploid individuals with a circular genome composed of g unique protein-coding genes (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 and Table 1 and SI Appendix, Methods). The genome is interspersed at random intervals with a generic repeat sequence, at an initial density  (i.e., with g repeats). Each generation consists of a replication stage using a multiplicative fitness function without epistasis, based on the number of functional wild-type alleles. Each individual in the new population then has a probability  of acquiring a fragment of

eDNA of length L. Recombination requires matching of the terminal loci of the eDNA sequence and the host genome, either to a protein-coding gene or a repeat sequence. When there is multiple matching, one of the homologous sequences is randomly selected, with weights inversely proportional to the difference in length between the eDNA and possible matching host genomic sequences. After LGT, individuals accumulate a random number of deleterious mutations, drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean U = g0 (where g0 is the number of wild-type protein-coding genes), with  being the per locus mutation rate. For specific details about the model implementation, we refer the reader to SI Appendix, Methods. A list of model parameters and variables is given in Table 1.
The evolutionary process is studied with a population initially free of mutants, over tmax = 5, 000 generations, with 100 independent iterations for a given set of parameter values. For each replicate, we evaluate the gene loss rate per generation from deletions (Md/t) and mutations (Mm/t) as the average load of deletions and mutations, respectively, divided by the number of generations. The total gene loss rate per generation M/t is calculated as the sum of these two components. The change in some key model variables (genome size, repeat content, total gene loss, mutation load, and duplication content) during the course of a standard simulation and the final distribution of the same variables at the end of a simulation are shown in SI Appendix, Figs. S3 and S4, respectively.
Results
Muller's Ratchet. The mean mutation load of the whole population and the number of mutations in the least-loaded class (LLC) reflect the interplay between genetic drift and Muller's ratchet (Fig. 1). In a clonal population with no LGT ( = 0), random fluctuations can cause the LLC to go extinct (a "click" of the ratchet), determining an ever-increasing mutation load baseline (Fig. 1A). In the absence of LGT, the fittest class cannot be restored and the increase in mutation load is irreversible. The introduction of LGT ( = 0:1) favors the elimination of mutations by increasing genetic variation and strengthening purifying selection, reducing the frequency at which the LLC is lost (Fig. 1B). In addition, LGT permits the reversal of Muller's ratchet and the reduction in mutation number in the LLC. But in the presence of a high repeat density ( = 0:1), the benefit of LGT comes at the price of deletions due to ectopic recombination, making LGT less obviously beneficial (Fig. 1C).
LGT and Repeats. Repeat density strongly influences the benefit of LGT. If repeat density is low ( = 102), increasing LGT () is advantageous and reduces the total gene loss rate (Fig. 2A). But as repeat density rises (  5  102), this benefit is eroded, and higher levels of LGT provide little or no benefit (Fig. 2A). At high levels of repeats (  101), LGT is always detrimental and elevates total gene loss (Fig. 2A). Splitting gene loss into its components, it becomes evident that the likelihood of ectopic recombination increases with higher density of repeats, leading to a sharp increase in gene loss through deletions (Fig. 2C). In addition, high repeat density limits the effectiveness of LGT in purging deleterious mutations due to selective interference (Fig. 2D). The net effect is that LGT ceases to have a beneficial effect beyond a threshold repeat density (Fig. 2B).
The lower efficiency of LGT at removing deleterious mutations arises because repeats make homologous recombination less likely and ectopic recombination more likely. This can be seen by adding a requirement for full homology throughout the whole eDNA (i.e., not only at the terminal loci; SI Appendix, Methods). This eliminates ectopic recombination, and mutation accumulation then closely follows the case without repeats, showing an accelerating decline with LGT rate (Fig. 3A). In contrast, with recombination based on end homology alone, there is only a monotonic decline in mutation accumulation as the rate of LGT increases (Fig. 3A). This is because the presence of repeats,

(A) Mean mutation load (green) and least-loaded class (LLC) mutation load (black) of a repeat-free ( = 0), nonrecombining population that does not undergo LGT ( = 0), across tmax = 10, 000 generations. Random fluctuations in allele frequencies due to genetic drift lead to irreversible increases of the LLC mutation load (Muller's ratchet). (B) In a repeat-free ( = 0) population undergoing LGT ( = 0:1, L = 5), recombination via LGT increases purifying selection, countering the ratchet. (C) In a population undergoing LGT ( = 0:1, L = 5) in the presence of repeats ( = 0:1), LGT allows the ratchet to be reversed, reducing the LLC mutation load, but the presence of repeats leads to a high rate of deletion, resulting in a high mean deletion load (yellow) and LLC deletion load (red).

together with the buildup of deletions, raises the probability that one or both ends of the eDNA lack homology to any genomic sequence (i.e., if the matching sequence has been deleted from the genome or if one end binds to a repeat sequence, but the other end either lacks a homologous sequence or is too far away

from it to recombine). Either scenario increases the probability that no recombination takes place (Fig. 3B). These effects combine to reduce the rate of homologous recombination as repeat density increases (Fig. 3B), constraining LGT's ability to purge deleterious mutations.

Changes in Genome Size. The limitations of LGT are greater in large genomes (13). This is partly because the probability that eDNA matches a particular mutated sequence (reducing the mutation load) decreases with genome size. This effect can be overcome through increases in L, the size of eDNA selected for recombination (13). But that previous analysis neglected the effect of repeat sequences. If repeat density is low ( = 0:01), increases in L are favorable and help populations with large genome size resist the ratchet (compare L = 2 and L = 10; Fig. 4A). However, with higher repeat density ( = 0:3), larger L is deleterious. It increases the total rate of gene loss and does nothing to stop the ratchet in large genomes (Fig. 4B). This transition arises for two reasons. In genomes with few repeats, deletions through ectopic recombination are negligible and increasing L has only a very minor effect on their occurrence as genome size increases (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). As almost all recombination events are homologous, increasing L is beneficial and facilitates the removal of deleterious mutations (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B). In contrast, when genomes are repeat rich ( = 0:3), the benefits of LGT are offset by an elevated rate of deletion (SI Appendix, Fig. S2C). This compromises the efficiency of eDNA repair of mutations, which becomes almost independent of L (SI Appendix, Fig. S2D).
Unlike repeat-free populations (13), increasing eDNA length proportionally to genome size provides little or no benefit in the presence of repeats. A large genome (g = 1, 000) cannot be sustained by LGT above a critical repeat density, as this engenders a rate of total gene loss comparable to that of a nonrecombining population (Fig. 5A, red triangles). The way out of this dilemma

is to require sequence homology throughout the eDNA. This ensures that recombination is homologous and allows a reduction of the mutation load with large L without incurring the associated increase in gene deletions. As a consequence, recombination is able to lower the total gene loss rate in large (g = 1, 000) genomes even in the presence of a high density of repeated sequences (Fig. 5A, yellow circles). Recombination lengths proportional to genome size (L = 0:1g ), homologous recombination across the entire length of the eDNA, and a high LGT rate ( = 1) are all needed to prevent a sharp increase in total gene loss associated with a large genome size (Fig. 5B, yellow circles).
Discussion
Asexual organisms are often portrayed as destined to accumulate mutations via Muller's ratchet, on an inevitable decline to extinction through mutational meltdown (35-37). This view emanates from a eukaryotic perspective seeking to explain the maintenance of sexual reproduction in the face of the twofold cost of sex and other costs relating to meiosis, finding a mate, and cell fusion (38-40). Prokaryotes, both bacteria and archaea, lack meiotic sex and typically reproduce through asexual division, but they nonetheless have a number of mechanisms for achieving genetic recombination (12, 41-43). In particular, LGT through transformation allows competent cells to pick up eDNA released from related lineages and to recombine it into their genome. In agreement with previous studies (10, 11, 13), our modeling shows that LGT generates genetic variation, strengthens purifying

The blue squares correspond to the null model of a nonrecombining population, where the total gene loss rate is independent from repeat density. This is compared with LGT of long eDNA sequences (L = 0:1g, red triangles) and recombination with full-sequence homology throughout the eDNA (yellow circles) with the same recombination length. (B) The impact of recombination length (L) on total gene loss as a function of genome size (g) in a repeat-rich genome (initial repeat density  = 0:3) under the requirement for full-sequence homology throughout the eDNA. To limit gene loss in large genomes, recombination length must increase proportionally to genome size (L = 0:1g, yellow circles). Error bars show the SD over 100 independent simulations. Gene loss rate was calculated over tmax = 5, 000 generations. Other parameters: N = 2, 500 and  = 105; in (A)  = 0:1, g = 1, 000 and (B)  = 1.

selection, and reduces the rate of mutation accumulation, performing a similar function to meiotic sex in eukaryotes (39, 44, 45). This leads to a simple question: why did the first eukaryotes abandon LGT and replace it with meiotic sex?
Our analysis shows that the benefits of LGT are curtailed by the presence of genetic repeats (Fig. 2A). Repeat sequences enable ectopic recombination, causing gene loss through deletions proportional to their density in the host genome (Fig. 2C). Repeats also make LGT less effective at purging deleterious mutations (Fig. 2D) by reducing the rate of correct homologous recombination (Fig. 3). This is mainly due to selective interference from the presence of deletions and mutations segregating at the same time (46-48). A population in which ectopic recombination has removed a portion of the genome will have lower Ne and weaker selection for any deleterious mutations in that region. In addition, as the frequency of the wild-type allele is reduced, it will be less likely to be in the eDNA, reducing the potential benefits of LGT. Moreover, repeats also make homologous recombination less likely, reducing the potency of LGT. Ectopic recombination events might restore deleted genes, but this effect is second order and outweighed by the detrimental effects of repeat sequences. Repeats cause a higher deletion rate, weaker selection, and lower homologous recombination rate, which amplify the loss of genetic information as their density increases (Figs. 2 and 3).
The acquisition of new genes through endosymbiotic gene transfer (including mobile self-splicing introns), plus duplication and divergence, led to massive genome expansion in the evolution of early eukaryotes (21, 25, 26). This made the first eukaryotes more vulnerable to the accumulation of mutations caused by Muller's ratchet. As genome size rises (g ), the homologous recombination rate per locus declines (assuming the probability of LGT remains constant) simply because the probability that an eDNA piece matches to a particular locus is inversely proportional to genome size (13). A solution to this is to increase the recombination length (L) (Fig. 4A). Other things being equal, picking up larger pieces of eDNA (larger L) increases the recombination rate per locus and thereby facilitates the elimination of deleterious mutations (13). But other things may not be equal, as environmental fragmentation and deterioration (as well as physical constraints on import) are likely to limit the length of eDNA that can be retrieved from the environment (49, 50). Of greater importance in our analysis, this potential solution is compromised by the presence of

genetic repeats. If repeats are common, larger recombination length (L) is associated with higher, rather than lower, loss of genetic information (Fig. 4B). A higher recombination length elevates the rate of ectopic recombination between dispersed repeated sequences, resulting in a greater rate of gene deletions. Similar disadvantages have been reported in extant prokaryotes, where higher repeat density is associated with greater genomic instability, increasing deletions, inversions, and other genomic rearrangements (33, 34). All of these issues are amplified as genome size increases, and beyond a threshold in repeat density, LGT brings no benefit to a large genome, even if the recombination length scales with genome size (Fig. 5A).
These considerations suggest that, in order to support an expanded genome rich in repeat sequences, the first eukaryotes had to abandon LGT for syngamy and homologous recombination. The fusion of cells (syngamy) and pooling of their genomes is a simple way to achieve larger L without potential fragmentation and deterioration of DNA through environmental release. In agreement with this, some of the largest LGT events in prokaryotes are observed in archaea that exchange genetic material after cell fusion. For example, archaea from the Haloferax genus are known to undergo reciprocal exchange of genetic material with L = 200,000-500,000 bp after cell fusion, against L = 2,000-6,000 bp transfer events typically observed in competent bacteria (18, 51, 52). In addition, there was a requirement for these large pieces of DNA to undergo homologous pairing in order to retain the benefits of recombination without losing genetic information through ectopic end pairing in the presence of repeats. We simulated this in our LGT model by adding a requirement for homology throughout the eDNA as well as homology at the ends. Homology matching eliminates gene deletion through ectopic recombination and allows mutation accumulation to be resisted even as repeat density increases (Fig. 5A). Considerable expansion of genome size is now permissible without catastrophic loss of genetic information through Muller's ratchet, provided that recombination length (L) scales with genome size (Fig. 5B). This is equivalent to homologous recombination across aligned chromosomes as seen in meiosis, though this neglects reciprocal exchange in meiosis rather than replacement in LGT.
For simplicity, our model considers only one type of repeat sequence. In reality, there will have been numerous repeats at different densities. Frequent gene duplications in early eukaryotes contributed to the increase in repeat density, and it is

estimated that the average copy number per gene in LECA was around 1.8 (25). Another source of repeat sequence in prokaryotic genomes is transposable elements (TEs) and other selfish genetic elements. TEs can promote their own spread and reduce host fitness in other ways, through gene function disruption or gene inactivation (53, 54), and are thought to play a major role in the streamlining of prokaryotic genomes (55). The density of mobile intron-derived sequences in ancestral eukaryotic genomes is estimated to be high (accounting for up to 80% of genome size), making the choice of  = 0:1 in most of our simulations a conservative one (56). As the focus of this study is on recombination and genetic information loss, we did not explicitly model the population dynamics of repeats but evaluated the effect of variation in their initial density. Future studies should consider a diversity of repeats and include fitness penalties at the individual level associated with their movement and density, as well as the expansion of selfish genetic elements through replication within genomes. In itself, this raises interesting questions about the distribution of repeats in extant prokaryotes--for instance, why the distribution of recombination length in prokaryotes is skewed toward shorter sequences (18), why gram-positive bacteria cleave eDNA sequences before recombination (57), and why the number of TEs and other mobile elements in prokaryote genomes is so tightly constrained (30, 58).
A further possibility not covered by our modeling is the presence of beneficial ectopic recombination events, in particular, those that contribute to the acquisition of novel genes. LGT via plasmids is the main source of acquisition of accessory genes from distant lineages (59-61) and has been shown to provide adaptive benefits (62). In contrast, transformation is mainly limited to sequences from closely related lineages, requiring a high degree of sequence homology, and so less likely to import foreign genes across large taxonomic distances (63-66). As such, the main advantage of transformation is believed to be maintaining local adaptation rather than import of novel functions (9). In our model, gene loading can occur via the acquisition of genes lost through deletion. However, in the presence of a high repeat density, this effect is negligible compared with the loss of genes via deletions. It seems unlikely that repeats are retained in order to enhance gene turnover from the pangenome, but a proper analysis of this question would require a different modeling approach (67, 68).
Wilkins and Holliday (32) suggested that meiosis could arise from mitosis in a single evolutionary step, the evolution of homologous pairing during prophase. They also suggested that the main function of meiosis is to limit the rate of ectopic recombination caused by the spread of repeated sequences in ancestral eukaryotic genomes (32). Our analysis here supports their idea that homologous pairing could have arisen because of

the need to evade the deleterious effect of pervasive genomic repeats. But Wilkins and Holliday did not explicitly address the impact of genome size expansion on mutation accumulation. We demonstrate that this is a crucial factor in escalating the severity of Muller's ratchet and determining the failure of LGT. Our results complement their hypothesis by showing that, in addition to restricting ectopic recombination, meiotic sex is also necessary to increase the total rate of recombination per base pair in expanding early eukaryotic genomes.
While our analysis demonstrates the selective advantage of meiotic sex, we do not explicitly address the multifaceted question of its evolution. The picture emerging from phylogenetic studies is that ancestral eukaryotes underwent a massive genome size expansion, but the precise timing of the events leading to eukaryogenesis is still a matter of debate (25, 26, 69). Did meiotic sex evolve after the acquisition of mitochondrial symbionts allowed eukaryotic genome size expansion (23, 24) or were the first eukaryotes able to expand their genomes because they could already undergo syngamy (cell fusion) and reciprocal exchange of genetic material, as observed in some extant archaea (51, 52, 70)? These archaea do not have unusually large genomes (4,000 genes), which suggests that mitochondrial acquisition was needed to drive the expansion in eukaryotic genome sizes, but wider sampling of archaeal genomes will throw more light on this question. When did premeiotic doubling and a two-step meiosis evolve, and what selective forces imposed the haploid-diploid system of reduction division (32, 71)? Why was meiosis the solution for an expanded eukaryotic nuclear genome (72, 73), while the endosymbiotic bacterial genome shrank almost to oblivion, lost capacity for LGT, and became a multiploid, asexual, uniparentally transmitted mitochondrial genome (74-76)? All those steps were crucial for the survival and evolution of early eukaryotes. Without them, complex life as we know it could not have survived its inception. Nonetheless, our work here shows why early eukaryotes had to take up whole chromosome-sized pieces of DNA and align them along their full length, rather than simply end matching, clarifying the first necessary step from LGT toward meiosis.

Engineering of zeolite BEA crystal size and morphology via seed-directed steam assisted conversion
Tatiana O. Bok,a Egor P. Andriako, a Elena E. Knyazevaab and Irina I. Ivanova *ab
The mechanism of seeding of zeolite BEA via steam assisted conversion has been studied using BEA seeds with different composition. The catalysts are characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, Hg-porosimetry, X-ray fluorescence and TPD of ammonia, and evaluated in benzene alkylation with propene. The results show that variation of the SiO2/ Al2O3 ratio from 25 to 250 in BEA seeds changes the mechanism of seeding from "core-shell" to a "dissolution" mechanism, which can serve as a tool for engineering the morphological, textural and catalytic properties of BEA zeolites. Al-rich seeds (SiO2/Al2O3  25) do not dissolve during gel preparation and initiate dense oriented crystal growth on their surface resulting in the formation of large polycrystals (1-2 mm) with ordered densely intergrown nanocrystallites. In contrast, Si-rich seeds (SiO2/ Al2O3  250) dissolve into tiny fragments, which serve as individual nuclei leading to formation of tiny isolated nanocrystallites aggregated into small hierarchical aggregates with high intercrystalline mesoporosity. The decrease of particle size and formation of intercrystalline mesoporosity in hierarchical aggregates improves the accessibility of acidic sites and facilitates the diffusion of reaction products, which leads to the significant improvement of catalytic activity and reduces the deactivation resulting in higher stability with time on stream in cumene synthesis from benzene and propylene.

Introduction
BEA zeolite is among the most widely used zeolites. It exhibits a three-dimensional pore system formed by 12-membered ring channels with a diameter of 0.76  0.64 and 0.55  0.55 nm, which ensures good accessibility of acid sites, high thermal stability and high acidity. Due to these properties BEA zeolite is an excellent catalyst and sorbent for a broad range of industrial processes1 including alkylation and hydroalkylation of aromatics,2,3 alkanes alkylation,4 transalkylation of alkylaromatics,5 Friedel-Cras acylation,6 catalytic cracking7 and depollution/decontamination processes (SCR of NOx, VOC adsorption).8 In addition, it shows high potential for the transformation and valorisation of bio-sourced substrates.9 It is well known that BEA zeolite can be obtained in the form of individual crystals (including nanocrystals),10,11 polycrystals

with intergrown nanocrystallites12 and hierarchical aggregates of nanocrystals with high content of intercrystallite mesopores.11,13,14 However, there is a lack of information on the means to control these morphological features and on their effect on the catalytic performance of BEA catalysts.
The conventional method of BEA zeolite synthesis involves hydrothermal crystallization of alkaline silico-alumina reaction mixtures with high concentration of organic structure-directing agent (OSDA) (OSDA/SiO2  0.4-0.6) at elevated temperatures (130-150 C) and autogenous pressure.15,16 The most used OSDA for the formation of BEA zeolite is tetraethylammonium (TEA) cation, which is applied in the form of hydroxide or halides. High content of TEA in the reaction mixture is necessary for the creation of high concentration of zeolitic nuclei and maintaining highly alkaline pH of synthesis. However, the cost of TEA is rather high and constitutes the main contribution to the production cost of BEA zeolite. Besides that, the removal of TEA from zeolitic porous system requires calcination, which gives rise to high energy consumption, high environmental burden, the necessity of processing of the waste gas and water produced by this process and therefore further increases the production costs.
To decrease the cost of BEA zeolite synthesis the OSDA-free route has been proposed. Xiao and co-workers reported an OSDA-free method in the presence of calcined BEA seeds.17 Majano et al. pointed that non-calcined seeds are preferable for

seed-assisted synthesis.18 Kamimura et al. suggested to use OSDA-free BEA as renewable seed crystals for the synthesis of completely "green beta".19 The development of OSDA-free seedassisted synthesis was a signicant step forward towards industrial production of BEA zeolite,20 however this route can be used only for the synthesis of low silica BEA zeolites (SiO2/Al2O3 < 15)19 with rather large crystal size (>400 nm).21
Another breakthrough in the eld of BEA zeolite synthesis was related to the development of steam assisted conversion (SAC) method.22,23 This method involves crystallization of dry silicoalumina gel containing non-volatile SDA in the presence of steam. It allows signicantly reduce the amount of template and water in the initial reaction mixture and therefore decrease the amount of waste, as well as increase the yield of the solid phase because of almost complete incorporation of reagents from the initial gel into the zeolite. Besides that, SAC method makes possible to obtain BEA zeolites with broad range of Si/Al ratio within 7 to N.24,25 Moreover, under proper conditions of synthesis this method can yield hierarchical zeolites composed of tiny nanocrystals assembled in aggregates containing large content of intercrystalline mesopores responsible for better intercrystallite diffusion and higher accessibility of zeolitic micropores.13 However, the latter result can be achieved in the presence of rather large amounts of template (TEAOH/SiO2 > 0.425).
To reduce further the amount of template and to decrease the crystallization temperature and time, Cheng et al.14 proposed to combine SAC and seeding technologies and established low-seeded low-templated seeding-steam-assisted conversion (SSAC) method beneting from synergetic action of TEOH and beta seeds. They have found that the optimal amount of seeds is 1% and the optimal TEAOH/SiO2 ratio is 0.1. Under these conditions, nanosized zeolite BEA with high crystallinity and abundant mesoporosity can be obtained. However, no information is available on the nature of seeds required for this process as well as on the mechanism of seeding operating during the steam assisted conversion. Herein, we report on the role of BEA seeds with different composition in the synthesis of zeolite BEA via SSAC method. We show that the composition of seeds is crucial for the mechanism of seeding and can serve for engineering of BEA crystal size and morphology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is of high importance for BEA catalytic performance in cumene synthesis from benzene and propene, which is among the most important areas of BEA zeolite applications.26-29
Experimental
Synthesis of BEA zeolites
The initial gel was prepared according to the procedure.14 Sodium hydroxide NaOH (98%, Alfa Aesar) was dissolved in distilled water, then aluminum sulfate Al2(SO4)3$18H2O (Alfa Aesar) was added. Aer dissolving the salt, TEAOH (35% aqueous solution, Aldrich), seed crystals of BEA zeolite (SiO2/ Al2O3  25, 75, 250, Zeolyst) and Aerosil were added stepwise and the resulting mixture was mechanically mixed until the homogeneous state. The amount of seeds was 1 wt% from the amount SiO2 in the gel. The reaction mixture had the following

composition: Al2O3$43.6SiO2$9.1Na2O$4.4TEAOH$350H2O$(1% seed). The resulting gel was dried for 12 hours at a temperature of 60 C and poured onto a holder in an autoclave containing some water at the bottom. The crystallization was conducted at 140 C for 48 hours. For comparison, one synthesis was carried out without seeds. In the latter case, the crystallization time was 120 hours. The samples are denoted as BEA-s-X, where X is SAR (25, 75, 250) of BEA seeds, added to initial gel. The sample denoted as BEA corresponds to the crystallization of dry gel prepared without seeds.
Upon the completion of crystallization, the solid product was separated on a Sigma-6-16 centrifuge at a rotor speed of 8000 rpm for 10 min. The crystalline product was washed to pH $ 9, dried at 60 C for 12 h, and calcined in an air ow at 550 C for 10 h (heating rate was 2 C min1).
To obtain the H-form of BEA zeolites, samples were ion exchanged in 0.1 mol L1 NH4NO3 solution thrice at 80 C for 3 h. Aer ion exchange, the solid phase was washed with distilled water, dried at a temperature of 100 C for 12 hours, and then calcined in a furnace in a constant stream of air at 500 C for 6 hours.
Characterization
X-ray phase analysis (XRD) of the samples was performed using diffraction patterns obtained on a Bruker D2PHASER X-ray diffractometer (radiation CuKa). The diffraction patterns were recorded in the 2q angle range of 5-50 with a step of 0.05, a slit width of 1 mm, and a recording time per point of 3. The degree of crystallinity of the samples was calculated relative to the external standard (highly crystalline BEA sample) using the reection at ca. 23 degrees.
The chemical composition of crystallization products isolated at different steps of the synthesis was determined using the X-ray uorescence analysis method on a Thermo Scientic ARL Perform'X instrument with a 3.5 kW rhodium tube.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the samples were obtained on a Hitachi TM3030 scanning electron microscope. Before imaging, the samples were covered with gold by vacuum deposition. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a transmission electron microscope FEI Osiris 300 (kV) with EDS Bruker SuperX operated at 200 kV, using TEM and HAADF detector.
The pore structure of the samples was studied by lowtemperature nitrogen adsorption-desorption and mercury porosimetry. Low-temperature nitrogen adsorption isotherms were recorded on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 porosimeter. Specic surface area and the volume of micropores (with a diameter less than 2 nm according to the IUPAC classication) were determined by the t-plot method. The volume of mesopores with the size of 2-50 nm was determined by the Barrett- Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. The macropore volume was determined on a Micromeritics AutoPore 9605 mercury porosimeter in accordance with the volume of mercury absorbed by the sample macropores with a diameter of more than 50 nm.
The acidic properties of the samples were studied by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD).

Experiments were conducted on a USGA-101 chemisorption analyzer (UNISIT, Russia). The sample in an amount of 0.15- 0.20 g was charged into a quartz tube reactor; the standard automatic pretreatment included the following sequential procedures: calcining the sample in a helium ow at 500 C for 1 h, saturation with ammonia at 60 C for 15 min and removal of physically adsorbed ammonia in a helium ow at 100 C. The NH3-TPD experiment was conducted in a helium ow (30 mL min1) at a rate of temperature increase of 8 C min1; desorbed ammonia was registered using a thermal conductivity detector. The content of acid sites (a0, mmol g1) was calculated basing on the amount of ammonia desorbed from the catalyst surface in the temperature range within 100-700 C.
Catalytic testing
The catalytic properties of the samples were studied in benzene alkylation with propylene in a continuous ow catalytic unit equipped with a xed-bed reactor under 3 MPa, at 170 C, WHSV of 52 and 2.4 h1 (referred to the propylene), in a nitrogen ow of 30 mL min1, and a benzene/propylene molar ratio of 5/1 and 10/1. A weighed portion of the catalyst with a fraction of 0.5-1 mm diluted with quartz was loaded into the reactor. The temperature of the reaction zone was controlled using a chromel-alumel thermocouple located in the catalyst bed. A benzene-propylene mixture was fed into the reactor by means of a piston pump. Prior to the reaction, all the catalysts were pre-treated at 350 C in a nitrogen ow of 30 mL min1 for 30 min; aer that, the temperature was decreased to the reaction temperature.

Gaseous and liquid reaction products were analyzed on Crystal-2000M chromatograph (Chromatec Analytic) equipped with ame ionization detectors using quartz capillary columns coated with the SE-30 phase (30 m). Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas.
Results and discussion
Structural, textural and morphological properties of the samples
To clarify the role of the chemical composition of seeds in SSAC synthesis of BEA, three BEA samples with SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (SAR) of 25, 75 and 250 purchased from ZEOLYST were used as seeds. The synthesis was performed from dry gels with the same template content (the TEAOH/SiO2 molar ratio of 0.1) and the same seed amount (1 wt%) using the procedure described previously.22 It should be noted that the size of BEA seeds with SAR of 25 and 75 was similar (100-300 nm), while the size of BEA crystals with SAR of 250 was larger (0.4-1.3 mm) (Fig. 1). The possibility to obtain BEA zeolite without seeds under the same conditions was also studied. Table 1 shows the inorganic yield of products obtained aer separation and washing, their chemical composition, textural and morphological properties.
According to XRD data (Fig. 2), the crystallization of seeded dry gels for 48 h at 140 C gives highly crystalline BEA zeolites. Reections corresponding to other crystalline or amorphous phases are not detected. On the contrary, the crystallization of the dry gel in the absence BEA seeds at this low template amount leads to amorphous material. Only at longer crystallization times (120 h) XRD pattern shows the reections of zeolite

BEA (Fig. S1). This observation differs from the ndings of Cheng et al.,14 who pointed to the formation of zeolite MOR with low crystallinity aer crystallization of non-seeded gel of the same composition for 48 h. However, our results denitely conrm that dry gel with TEAOH/SiO2  0.1 is rather difficult to crystallize into zeolite BEA in the absence of seeds and that the presence of zeolite seeds is crucial for these conditions.
Table 1 shows that the inorganic yield of all solid products is rather high and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in synthesized BEA materials is close to SAR in the initial gel, which is typical for the crystallization of dry gel23,24 and differs from hydrothermal synthesis.30 However, as can be noted from Table 1, for all the samples the yield is lower than 100% and SAR is lower than in the initial gel. This points to slightly lower incorporation efficiency of silica species with respect to alumina. Most probably, soluble silicate species which were not involved in crystallization are washed out from the dry gel by water vapor during the synthesis or by rinse water during washing procedure. The difference between the samples is not signicant however there is a noticeable tendency in decreasing of product yield from 88 to 80% and SAR from 37 to 32 with increasing SAR in seeds (Table 1). This points to signicant effect of seeds composition on the crystallization behavior of dry gel.
The comparison of SEM images of crystallization products shown in Fig. 3 suggests that the addition of seeds not only increases the crystallization rate and allows to get highly crystalline BEA zeolites in less time, but also inuences the morphology and particle size of the samples obtained. The sample BEA synthesized in the absence of seeds show large and smooth BEA zeolite particles with the size of 1.5-4 mm (Fig. 3a). The addition of seeds results in the decrease of particle size up to 0.2 mm. Among the seeded samples the smallest particles of $0.2 mm are observed in the case of sample BEA-s-250 (Fig. 3d), whereas the largest particles of 0.7-1.4 mm are found for sample BEA-s-25 (Fig. 3b). The sample BEA-s-75 shows intermediate case with broad particle distribution within 0.3-1.3 mm (Fig. 3c).

Fig. 3 SEM images of samples prepared by the SAC method in the absence (a) and in the presence of seeds with a different SAR of 25 (b), 75 (c) and 250 (d).
It appears that the size of BEA particles in the products does not depend on the crystal size of the seeds used for SSAC but is inuenced mainly by their SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. The increase of SAR in seeds from 25 to 250 leads to the decrease of average size of BEA zeolite particles from 1 to 0.2 mm. This effect is presumably due to different dissolution rate of seeds with different SAR in the alkaline media during the gel preparation. Similar tendency was observed in the case of seeded OSDA-free synthesis under hydrothermal conditions.31 However, in that case the authors observed also the inuence of seed crystal size, which was much stronger than the effect of SAR.
Besides SAR, the dissolution of seeds in the alkaline media can be also affected by the presence of defects in the zeolite structure.32,33 To verify the effect of defects, FT-IR and 29Si MAS NMR data were used (Fig. S3 and S4). The results show that the amount of SiOH defects is similar in the case of BEA-75 and BEA-250 seeds and lower in the case of BEA-25 (Table S1). This result suggests that the amount of defects in seeds is not the main factor in our case.
Thus, in our crystallization conditions the key factor which inuences the crystal size of the product is the seed SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. Although the seeds used for the synthesis of BEA-s-250 have the largest size (0.4-1.3 mm), they have the lowest stability and the highest rate of dissolution in the alkaline media due to low Al content. This results in higher amount of crystallization nuclei in the gel and therefore smaller particle size in the product. On the contrary, the seeds used for the synthesis BEA-s-25 are much smaller in size (0.1-0.3 mm), but due to high content of Al the dissolution rate in this case is lower, which results in the lesser amount of crystallization nuclei and larger particle size. In the case of BEA-s-75, the size of seeds is the same as in BEA-s-25, but SAR is higher, which leads to smaller BEA particles. High heterogeneity in the size of BEA particles in the latter case could be due to non-uniform

dissolution of seeds with SiO2/Al2O3 of 75 and formation of nucleation centers with broad distribution in size. Apparently, for the process of BEA zeolite formation by steam-assisted synthesis from the matrix of the dense gel with a low mobility of components, it is very important to have a uniform and homogeneous distribution of nuclei in the matrix of a dense dried precursor-gel.12
The TEM images of the synthesized samples reveal that all the BEA particles observed in SEM images are composed of nanocrystallites with uniform size of 5-30 nm but different packing density (Fig. 4).
Samples BEA and BEA-s-25 show polycrystals with ordered intergrown nanocrystallites of 5-30 nm with lattice fringes oriented in the same direction throughout the whole particle. On the contrary, the TEM image of the sample BEA-s-250 reveals hierarchical aggregates of assembled/intergrown nanocrystallites of 5-20 nm with lattice fringes oriented in different directions. The sample BEA-s-75 shows different regions composed of polycrystalline particles with ordered intergrown nanocrystallites and hierarchical aggregates of assembled/ intergrown nanocrystallites.
These observations are fully in line with adsorption data shown in Fig. 5. Samples BEA and BEA-s-25 show type I nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, characterized by a signicant uptake at low pressure (P/P0 < 0.1) and nearly at region in the range of P/P0  0.1-0.9. A step in the range of P/P0 > 0.9 is due to interparticle adsorption, whereas small inexion and hysteresis around P/P0 of 0.45 indicates that polycrystals contain small amount of mesopores with restricted connection to the external surface of polycrystals.
Such isotherms are typical for microporous zeolites with large crystals, which is indeed revealed by SEM images of BEA and BEA-s-25 showing large polycrystals with the size of 1.5-4.0 and 0.7-1.4 mm, respectively (Fig. 3a and b). The pore size distributions in these samples calculated from the desorption branches based on the BJH model (Fig. S2) shows two peaks: a narrow one at ca. 4 nm and a broad one in the range of higher than 10 nm. The former is attributed to the so-called tensile

strength effect associated with a forced closure of the hysteresis loop which is observed in a sudden drop of volume adsorbed at the P/P0  0.45.34 The latter can be assigned to the adsorption in the interparticle meso- and macropores, which extend beyond the detection range of nitrogen sorption. Application of Hgporosimetry show that the mean diameter of the pores formed in between BEA polycrystals in sample BEA-s-25 is ca. 750 nm (Fig. 5b), which is in line with SEM data (Fig. 3b).
Samples BEA-s-75 and BEA-s-250 show different adsorption- desorption isotherms, characterized by a slope in the range of P/ P0  0.1-0.9 with a distinct H3 hysteresis loop originating from capillary condensation. Such isotherms correspond to hierarchical micro-mesoporous materials containing both micropores and mesopores. The BJH analysis (desorption branch) reveals very broad distribution of mesopores in the range of 4- 100 nm and higher (Fig. S2). The broadest pore size distribution is observed in the case of BEA-s-75, which is characterized by the broadest size distribution of crystal aggregates (Fig. 3c). These mesopores could be attributed to both intercrystalline pores located in between the nanocrystallites intergrown in BEA aggregates and the pores formed in between BEA aggregates. Hg-porosimetry point that the mean diameters of the pores in

between BEA aggregates of samples BEA-s-75 and BEA-s-250 are ca. 490 and 170 nm (Fig. 5b), which corresponds to the size of BEA aggregates determined by SEM (Fig. 3c and d).
Textural properties of the samples, summarized in Table 1, demonstrate that the total pore volume (determined as the volume sorbed at P/P0  0.95) and surface area increase in the following range of the samples: BEA < BEA-s-25 < BEA-s-75 < BEA-s-250 due to the increased contribution of mesopores, whereas the micropore volume is the highest in the case of BEAs-250 (0.24 cm3 g1).
To summarize the analysis of the data obtained suggest that the composition of seeds used for dry gel crystallization affect signicantly textural and morphological properties of the nal products. High aluminum content (SAR  25) in seeds leads to formation of large polycrystals composed of densely intergrown ordered nanocrystallites with low contribution of intra- and interparticle mesopores. On the contrary, low Al content in seeds (SAR  250) results in formation of small hierarchical aggregates of assembled/intergrown disordered nanocrystallites with high contribution of intra- and interparticle mesopores. The sample BEA-s-75 shows intermediate case with broad distribution of particles and pores. The observed differences in textural and morphological features suggest that the aluminium content in the seeds affects the mechanism of seeding.
Effect of seeds composition on the mechanism of seeding
There are several hypotheses in the literature on the fate of seeds during hydrothermal synthesis of zeolite BEA and on the mechanism of seeding.20,31,35,36 Xiao et al.35 proposed core-shell mechanism, according to which BEA seeds introduced during the gel preparation remain intact during the hydrothermal synthesis and provide a surface for crystal growth. Kamimura et al.36 suggested that BEA seeds are partially dissolved and disaggregated into small pieces during the initial step of hydrothermal treatment and the new BEA is crystallized on the surface of these species exposed and/or dispersed in the interface of the amorphous aluminosilicate and the liquid phase. Finally, Zheng et al.31 revealed that both BEA seed residues and the dissolved BEA fragments can serve as the source of nuclei for crystal growth.
To understand the mechanism of seeding in the case of SSAC method and to elucidate the role of BEA seeds with different composition on this mechanism we tried to analyze the fate of different seeds during SSAC. To establish the relationship between the amount of seeds taken for synthesis and the amount of BEA particles (polycrystals or aggregates) in nal products we made a simple estimation based on the knowledge of the mean size of crystals in BEA seeds and products determined from SEM images. The detailed description is given in ESI (Table S2). The results of calculations are presented in Table 2.
The data obtained show that the seed with SAR  25 and the mean size of crystal of 200 nm produces a single polycrystal with the size of 1000 nm, whereas the seed with SAR  250 and the size of 1000 nm yields 1  104 crystal aggregates with the size of

200 nm. These ndings give a hint that the seeds rich in Al do not dissolve during gel preparation and each seed provides a surface for nanocrystals growth via core-shell mechanism. The nanocrystallites are therefore grown in the same direction from the surface nuclei, which leads to the formation of polycrystals with densely intergrown nanocrystallites as in the case of membranes.37,38
On the contrary, Si-rich seeds (SAR  250) dissolve into tiny fragments which are homogeneously dispersed in the gel during its preparation. During the crystallization, these tiny fragments serve as individual nuclei for BEA crystallization, which lead to the formation of BEA nanocrystallites grown in different directions and formation of hierarchical materials with two types of mesopores: in between nanocrystallites inside BEA aggregates and in between aggregates of nanocrystallites.
In the sample BEA-s-75, the particle size distribution in the product is very broad and accurate estimations cannot be done, however this sample obviously shows an intermediate case since the product contains both polycrystals with densely intergrown nanocrystallites with bigger size and aggregates of nanocrystallites with smaller size (Fig. 4c). Operation of two different mechanisms explains very broad distribution of BEA particles in this case (Fig. 3c).
The mechanism proposal presented in Fig. 6 rationalizes further all the above observations. During the gel preparation, the seeds are subjected to strong alkaline media, which leads to their partial dissolution. The degree of dissolution depends on SiO2/Al2O3 in the seeds. The Si-O-Al bonds are rather stable for hydrolysis in alkaline media compared to Si-O-Si bonds, which are easily hydrolyzed. Therefore, the seeds with high density of framework Al sites (SAR  25) are practically inert to dissolution, as most of the Si atoms are stabilized by neighboring Al. On the contrary, the seeds with high density of Si atoms (SAR  250) undergo substantial dissolution and formation of numerous zeolitic fragments, homogeneously dispersed in the gel. The seeds with intermediate SAR  75 may lead to both large seeds residues and small zeolitic fragments.
During the crystallization step the intact seeds, residual seeds and tiny zeolitic fragments are involved in nucleation. Large zeolitic seeds and seeds residues provide for large number of nuclei on their surface, which initiates dense oriented crystal growth leading to the formation of polycrystals with ordered intergrown nanocrystallites, showing lattice fringes oriented in the same direction throughout the whole particle (Fig. 4b). Small zeolitic fragments provide for individual dispersed nuclei, which are converted during crystallization

assembled/intergrown nanocrystallites and results in very broad particle size distribution.

Acidic properties
The acidic properties of the samples obtained were studied by the NH3 TPD method (Fig. 7). The NH3 TPD proles for all the samples show two pronounced peaks indicating the presence of two types of acid sites in BEA zeolites, i.e., weak acid sites characterized by the peak at 200 C and strong acid sites showing the peak at 380-400 C. The quantication of the NH3 TPD data presented in Table 1 point that the content of acid sites is very similar for samples BEA, BEA-s-25 and BEA-s-75 (ca. 800 mmol g1), whereas in the case of the sample BEA-s-250 this value is slightly higher and amounts to 920 mmol g1.
This observation can be due to both a lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in this product and/or its higher crystallinity. Thus, our results demonstrate that steam assisted conversion with variable seed composition allows to obtain BEA zeolites with different crystal size and morphology but similar chemical composition and acid properties.
Catalytic evaluation in benzene alkylation with propylene
The catalytic properties of the samples with different morphology and particle size and similar acidity were studied in liquid-phase alkylation of benzene with propylene under 3 MPa and at 170 C. High propene weight hourly space velocity (WHSVpropylene  52 h1) was used to observe the difference between the catalysts. Two sets of experiments with benzene/ propylene (B/P) molar ratio of 10/1 and 5/1 were carried out to compare the catalysts activity and stability with time on stream. The main products observed in both sets of experiments involved cumene, diisopropylbenzenes (DIPB) and trace amounts of triisopropylbenzenes (TIPB) and n-propylbenzene (NPB). Besides that, small amounts of other products were observed including propylene oligomers, fragmentation products and etc. The results are depicted in Fig. 8 and Table 3.
At higher B/P molar ratio of 10, the conversion is more stable with TOS, which allows to compare the activity of various catalysts. The results (Fig. 8a) show that all the catalysts

Fig. 8 Propylene conversion versus time on stream at 3 MPa, 170 C, WHSVpropylene  52 h1 and B/P molar ratio of 10 (a) and 5 (b).
obtained with seeds are more active than those synthesized without seeds. Among the seeded catalysts, the following range of activity is observed: BEA-s-250 > BEA-s-75 > BEA-s-25. Sample BEA-s-250 involving hierarchical aggregates with small size (100-300 nm) demonstrates the highest catalytic activity. On the contrary, polycrystalline BEA-s-25 with large particle size (0.7- 1.4 mm) shows the lowest propene conversion. It should be mentioned that the order of activity also correlates with SiO2/ Al2O3 ratio and the content of acid sites in the samples. However, according to ref. 29, these rather modest differences in composition could hardly explain the signicant difference in activity, which is most probably related to the size and morphology of BEA particles.
The analysis of product distribution (Table 3) points to the increase of the content of bulky DIPB and TIPB products of alkylation on the expense of cumene in the same range of catalysts. These bulky products are most probably formed on the external surface and in the pre-surface layer of BEA particles or in the intercrystallite mesopores of BEA aggregates.39 The increase of the external surface area and the intercrystallite mesoporosity in the following range of catalysts BEA-s-250 > BEA-s-75 > BEA-s-25, thus explains the observed differences in activity and selectivity.

To conclude, the small size of BEA zeolite aggregates and the presence of intra- and interparticle mesopores improve the accessibility of acidic sites and facilitate the mass transfer, which contributes to more efficient diffusion of reagents and reaction products from acidic sites of the catalyst and accounts for higher activity and deeper alkylation into DIPB and TIPB.
The catalyst deactivation is more pronounced in the set of experiments with B/P molar ratio of 5 (Fig. 8b), which is caused by signicant contribution of propylene oligomerization at the higher propylene content in the reaction mixture and formation of heavier products. This is consistent with the literature data.27
The highest rate of deactivation observed in the case of samples BEA and BEA-s-25 can be ascribed to diffusion limitations in large polycrystals, which prevents the desorption of the products from the catalyst and favours secondary reactions leading to heavy carbonaceous deposits blocking the catalyst porous system. The formation of hierarchical aggregates with smaller particle size in the case of sample BEA-s-250 facilitates the diffusion of reaction products and reduces the deactivation rate of the catalyst leading to higher stability with time on stream.
The best catalyst performance in terms of activity and stability was observed over BEA-s-250 catalyst. This catalyst shows the highest activity and resistance to deactivation.

Therefore it was tested under the conditions close to industrial operation of zeolite catalysts in benzene alkylation with propene: 3 MPa, 170 C, WHSVpropylene  2.4 h1, B/P  5/1 (Fig. 9). The results show that the sample provides for 100% conversion of propene, the selectivity to alkylation products (cumene + DIPB + TIPB) of 99.7 wt%, and a cumene selectivity of 86.7 wt% within 10 h of testing.
Conclusions
It is demonstrated that by variation BEA seeds composition during SSAC it is possible to change the size of BEA particles from several microns to hundred nanometers and to modify their morphology from polycrystalline BEA particles with densely intergrown nanocrystallites to hierarchical aggregates of nanocrystallites with high intercrystalline mesoporosity. The seeds with SiO2/Al2O3 of 25 give large polycrystalline BEA particles with mean size of 1.0 mm. On the contrary, the seeds with SiO2/Al2O3 of 250 yield small hierarchical aggregates with mean size of 200 nm. The seeds with intermediate SiO2/Al2O3 of 75 provide for both polycrystals and aggregates with broad particle size distribution within 0.3-1.3 mm.
The results suggest that the composition of seeds determines the mechanism of seeding. Al-rich seeds provide for core-shell mechanism involving the nucleation and crystal growth on the external surface of the intact particles of parent seeds and leading to the formation of core-shell particle of product with the initial seed in the core and the dense intergrown nanocrystallites in the shell. Si-rich seeds obey dissolution mechanism including dissolution and disaggregation of the initial seeds and formation of tiny zeolitic fragments, which serve as individual nuclei for the formation of numerous tiny isolated nanocrystallites aggregating in hierarchical particles.
The evaluation of BEA catalysts with different particle size and morphology in benzene alkylation with propene revealed that the decrease of particle size and formation of intercrystalline mesoporosity in hierarchical aggregates leads to the signicant improvement of catalytic activity and reduces the deactivation resulting in higher stability with time on stream in cumene synthesis. The effect is due to the improvement of the

acidic sites accessibility and the transport of reaction products. The best catalyst performance in terms of activity and stability was observed over BEA catalyst obtained from Si-rich seeds (SAR  250), which showed 100% conversion of propene, 99.7 wt% selectivity to alkylation products and the highest stability with time on stream.

As potential hypergolic fuels, hypergolic ionic liquids have attracted much attention since their development. Herein, a series of hypergolic ionic liquids based on asymmetric [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+ cations were synthesized. The asymmetric structure of these hypergolic ionic liquids was further
confirmed by NMR, infrared (IR), and high-resolution mass spectrometry-electron spray ionization (HRMS-ESI). Moreover, these hypergolic ionic liquids possess a high density of over 1.00 g cm3, a comprehensive liquid range from 60 C to 20 C, and a density-specific impulse performance ranging from 305.4 to 357.8 s g cm3, which is superior to that of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine.
Remarkably, (1-allyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium-1-yl)(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium-1-yl) dihydroboronium dicyandiamide had the best ignition-delay time (18 ms), a high density (1.114 g cm3), and a high value for heat of formation (400 kJ mol1/1.48 kJ g1). This work provides the possibility of a promising and
green hypergolic fuel as rocket propellant.

1. Introduction
Hydrazine and hydrazine derivatives have played a crucial role in liquid bipropellants due to their low price, low viscosity, and short ignition-delay times. However, their disadvantages, such as operating risk, expensive handling procedures, and highly carcinogenic properties, have hindered the development of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and hydrazine derivatives.1,2 Thus, researchers have attempted to nd green alternatives for these derivatives of hydrazine. Ionic liquids (ILs), as environmentally friendly materials, have attracted much attention owing to their ability to be rationally designed. As energetic materials, through adjusting the anions and cations, the demand for energetic ionic liquids could be effortlessly achieved. Moreover, for liquid bipropellants, the low vapor pressure and high density of the ionic liquids also renders them a suitable choice to take the place of hydrazine derivatives.
Since 2008,3-7 when dicyandiamide was rst applied as the anion for energetic ionic liquids, a host of investigations have been reported. It exhibited a self-ignition phenomenon when it was touched with 100% HNO3 and, since then, much emphasis has focused on the reaction with white fuming nitric acid (WFNA). Borane was rst introduced into hypergolic ionic

liquids by Shreeve and co-workers,8 and as an additive it exhibited pretty remarkable properties, with superior, low ignition-delay (ID) times and negligible vapor pressure, almost satisfying the critical criteria for a liquid bipropellant, compared with UDMH. Meanwhile, the role played by borane in the hypergolic reaction was also revealed by density functional theory, which showed that the strong reducing B-H bond was responsible for the superior, low ignitiondelay times. Thus, introduction of reducing B-H bonds in cations or anions may markedly promote the performance of hypergolic ionic liquids. Based on the above, in order to improve the enthalpy of borohydride and cyanoborohydride anions, azoles were used to react with metal borohydride or cyanoborohydride to form the corresponding anions.8-11 All these hypergolic ionic liquids exhibited excellent ignition-delay times, heats of formation, and viscosity.12-17 For cations, boronium-cation-based hypergolic ionic liquids were developed to improve the fuel-rich properties of the hypergolic ionic liquids. For example, [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+ and [imidazolyl-amine-BH2]+ cations possess a high enthalpy of combustion compared with imidazolyl-based hypergolic ionic liquids, making them an attractive possibility, since for the commonly used [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+ cations the structures were oen symmetrical as a result of the synthetic routes used. For hypergolic ionic liquids, asymmetrically substituted cations are of more value for their lower melting points.18 However, there were few reports of asymmetrical cations based on the [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+ cation. Thus, the synthesis of new asymmetrical boronium-cationbased ionic liquids is of much interest, to reveal the relationship between the structure and performance of hypergolic fuels.
Herein, two types of asymmetric [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+cation-based ionic liquids were successfully synthesized with

N(CN)2 and BH3CN as counterions, as shown in Fig. 1. By taking advantage of the N-alkyl imidazole borane as the precursor, a series of asymmetric [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+ cations could be rationally designed through choice of the alkyl imidazole. Density, thermal stability, viscosity, and hypergolicity in touching WFNA were measured and subsequently investigated. Moreover, 1H, 13C, 11B NMR, and HRMS-ESI spectra were recorded to determine the asymmetric structures of the cations. To determine the heats of formation, isodesmic reactions were used. To further understand the reaction between ionic liquids and WFNA, and the differences in viscosity of these ionic liquids, the natural population charges of cations and BH3CN anions were studied by non-covalent interaction (NCI) analysis using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs, and displayed using CYLview.19,20 Moreover, to comprehensively evaluate the energetic properties of these ionic liquids, the heats of combustion, specic impulses, and ignition-delay times were all calculated or recorded.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Cautions
During this research no hazardous substances were used in the experiments. However, all substances should be handled carefully following safety training.
2.2. General methods
The melting point test was conducted by differential scanning calorimetry (TAQ2000, NETZSCH) at a scan rate of 5C min1, while the decomposition temperature was recorded on a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA5500, NETZSCH) with the same scan rate. HRMS-ESI spectroscopy was conducted on an Agilent 6540TOF with a Brooke solanX 70 FT-MS and Thermo QE ORBITRAP equipped with ESI. 1H, 13C, and 11B NMR spectroscopy were performed on a Bruker Advance NEO with DMSO-d6 as the solvent. When 11B NMR spectra were recorded, a blank sample was run to determine the inuence of the 11B signal arising from the borosilicate glass. Infrared spectra were obtained using tableting with potassium bromide on a Fouriertransform IR (FT-IR) spectrometer (WQF-510A). Density and viscosity measurements were recorded at 25 C on an Anton Parr, equipped with DMA5000M and Lovis2000ME.

2.3. Calculation procedure
The heat of formation is a crucial factor for the specic impulse of hypergolic ionic liquids. However, it is hard to obtain through experiments, so calculation is the best choice. Therefore, using the Gaussian 09 (Revision D.01) suite of programs, the optimization of structures, frequency analysis, and single energy points were all investigated employing B3LYP/6311+G**//MP2/6-311++G**. For the boronium-cation-based ionic liquids, based on the Born-Haber cycle (shown in Scheme 1), the heat of formation (HOF) of the ionic liquid could be calculated,19,21 with details as in the ESI (Tables S1 and S2).

Based on eqn (1), the HOF of the ionic liquids was obtained by calculating the value of the HOF of the anions and cations, respectively. Isodesmic reactions were further used to improve the accuracy, and details of the isodesmic reactions are shown in Scheme 2.

with vigorous stirring to dissolve the crude product. Meanwhile, the clear solution was washed with ethyl acetate (3  100 mL), and dichloromethane was added subsequently to extract the desired product from the emulsion. Finally, a viscous liquid was obtained by removing dichloromethane. The details for compounds (2a-2e) can be found in the ESI.
2.4.3 Synthesis of compounds 3a-3e. An aqueous solution of the appropriate compound 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, or 2e (20 mmol) in 40 mL H2O was added dropwise into a suspension of silver dicyanamide (24 mmol) in 60 mL H2O. In the absence of light, the mixture was vigorously stirred for 24 h. Aer ltration, water was removed by rotary evaporation to obtain a viscous and transparent liquid. The characterization of compounds 3a-3e can be found in the ESI.
2.4.4 Synthesis of compounds 4a-4e. An aqueous solution of the appropriate compound 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, or 2e (20 mmol) in 40 mL CH2Cl2 was added dropwise into a suspension of sodium cyanoborohydride (24 mmol) in 40 mL CH2Cl2. At room temperature, the mixture was stirred vigorously for 24 h. Aer ltration, CH2Cl2 was removed by rotary evaporation to obtain a viscous and transparent liquid. The details of the compounds 4a-4e can also be found in the ESI.

2.4. Synthesis of hypergolic ionic liquids
2.4.1 Pretreatment. 1-Methylimidazole borane complex was synthesized according to the literature with minor adjustments.24 The pure 1-methylimidazole borane complex was obtained by dissolving it in dichloromethane, ltering, and removing solvent under reduced pressure. Silver dicyandiamide was prepared based on the previously reported methods.25 Sodium cyanoborohydride was purchased from commercial sources. All solvents in the experiment were pretreated before use.
2.4.2 Synthesis of compounds 2a-2e. The synthesis procedures for compounds 2a-2e were similar to those reported in the literature, with modication.26 The synthesized 1-methylimidazole borane complex (9.59 g, 100 mmol) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF 100 mL) was kept at 30 C with stirring in a round-bottomed ask (250 mL). Then, I2 (12.69 g, 50 mmol) dissolved in THF (50 mL) was added dropwise. Most importantly, the amount of I2 added should not be in excess, which might lead to formation of the symmetric boronium-cationbased ionic liquid. The gas evolved quickly with addition of I2, so it should be handled carefully. Aer complete addition, the mixture was kept for one hour with vigorous stirring, then the N-alkyl imidazole (100 mmol) was added to the mixture drop by drop. Aer that, the solution was stirred at 25 C for one hour and reuxed overnight. During the procedure the solution became transparent and two liquid layers formed. The upper layer was THF and the bottom layer was the desired crude product. For further purication, water (150 mL) was added

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure characterization of asymmetric [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+-cation-based ionic liquids
Asymmetric structures play a crucial role in affecting the physical properties of ionic liquids. However, asymmetric structures are hard to obtain. By taking advantage of N-alkyl imidazole borane as the precursor, a series of asymmetric [bis(imidazolyl)BH2]+ cations were obtained by rational design through choice of the alkyl imidazole. From the 1H NMR spectrum of compound 3e (as shown in Fig. 2), two peaks at 8.74 ppm and 8.66 ppm were observed belonging to the hydrogen in the imidazole ring of different alkyl imidazoles, which demonstrated the asymmetric structure of the cations. For compound 4e, characteristic peaks below 1 ppm could also be clearly seen, as a result of the BH3CN anion. Moreover, the 13C NMR spectrum of compound 3e also demonstrated two peaks at 48.18 ppm and 35.33 ppm, which were assigned to the CH2 in 1butylimidazole and CH3 in 1-methylimidazole, respectively. Using data from the 1H NMR and 13 CNMR spectra, the asymmetric structure of these [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+ cations could be conrmed. Furthermore, a sharp band at approximately 2427 cm1 derived from the B-H bond was found in the IR spectra of compounds 2e, 3e, and 4e. Likewise, bands at approximately 2233 cm1 and 2127 cm1 in the IR spectra were assigned to the cyanide bonds and the nitrogen-carbon bonds of compound 3e aer complete ion exchange, while bands at 2327 cm1 and 2160 cm1 were classied as the cyanide bonds in the cyanoborohydride anion of compound 4e.27
3.2. Density and viscosity of [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+-cationbased ionic liquids
Density is an essential property of hypergolic fuels, where a high density is advantageous to the energy performance of the

asymmetric [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+-cation-based HILs, compound 3d possessed the highest density of 1.114 g cm3, and compound 4e had the lowest (1.003 g cm3). Obviously, for the same anions, ionic liquids with cations of similar structure show little signicant difference in their density. However, for different anions, the dicyandiamide anion possessed a higher density than the ionic liquid with the cyanoborohydride anion. In addition, with regard to viscosity, slight differences in the structures of the cations lead to dramatic variations. Alongside increase in the substituent chain length of the alkyl imidazole, the viscosity was noticeably affected as a result of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions of the cations,21 which has an adverse effect on the mixture of fuels and oxidizer, and further impacts the ignition-delay time of the hypergolic ionic liquids. To investigate the difference in the viscosity between these asymmetric [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+-cation-based ionic liquids, NCI analysis was conducted with a reduced density gradient using Multiwfn and VMD 1.9.3.28,29 As shown in Fig. 3, both HILs had an evident electrostatic interaction between anions and cations. Through NCI analysis of compound 3c, two spikes in the compound A1 were obtained, which can be classied as steric hindrance in the imidazole ring and the electric interaction between the anions and cations. Moreover, for the cyanoborohydride anion, there existed a large area of noncovalent interaction in B1, which, to some degree, was responsible for the higher viscosity and relatively longer ignition-delay times.
3.3. Thermal properties of [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+-cationbased ionic liquids
The melting points (Tm) of the ionic liquids were associated with the cations that were deeply affected by the length of the

hypergolic ionic liquid (HIL). In this work, each ionic liquid had a high density of nearly 1.00 g cm3, which was far higher than that of UDMH (0.793 g cm3). Moreover, among these

side chain of the alkyl imidazole cations. For individual [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+-cation-based ionic liquids, there was also an obvious increase in melting point with increase in the length of the substituents. However, compared with the bis(1-methyl-1Himidazole-3-yl)dihydroboronium dicyandiamide (30 C) reported previously,30 compound 3d had a lower melting point, although it had the highest melting point (20 C) among the ve dicyandiamide ionic liquids synthesized here. As a result, for the dicyandiamide anion, it seems that these asymmetric boronium-cation-based ionic liquids possess a lower melting point and a more comprehensive liquid range, which is benecial for applications in a harsh environment. Furthermore, the side chain signicantly impacted the decomposition temperature of the ionic liquids (as shown in Fig. 4). For these asymmetric boronium-cation-based dicyandiamides, the decomposition temperature ranged from 159 C to 185 C. As for the cations of compounds 3a and 3b, the two B-N bond lengths displayed a marked difference, which explained why compound 3b was more unstable (Table S1). Meanwhile, compound 3d is more stable than compound 3c. The heat of formation and heat of combustion (HOC) are two crucial

parameters when evaluating the performance of a bipropellant. For these hypergolic ionic liquids based on asymmetric [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+-cations, the values of HOC and HOF exhibited visible differences alongside differences in the degree of unsaturation and length of the side chain of the alkyl imidazole. The HOF of these asymmetric [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+-cation-based ionic liquids ranged from 26 kJ mol1 to 400 kJ mol1, and most were higher than that of UDMH (51.9 kJ mol1)27. In addition, all the HOC values for these HILs were below 7330 kJ mol1, which is far lower than that of UDMH (1982.6 kJ mol1), meaning that more energy is released when the IL fuels react with an oxidizer (Fig. 5). Thus, with respect to the HOF and HOC values, there is no doubt that these asymmetric [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+-cation-based HILs are promising candidates as alternatives for hydrazine derivatives.
3.4. Ignition test with WFNA
Ignition-delay time is also an essential factor in assessing the performance of hypergolic fuels. In terms of traditional liquidpropellant rocket engines, the ignition-delay time should be shorter than 50 ms to prevent detonation and ensure the safety of the rocket engine. For these ionic liquids, about 23 mg of fuels were added into a 10 mL penicillin bottle containing 0.5 mL 100% HNO3. The process (Fig. 6) was recorded with a high-speed camera at 1000 frames per second (fps). As shown in Table 1, it could be seen that the ID time varied from 18 ms to 628 ms. Most dicyandiamide ionic liquids had an ID time below

50 ms to guarantee security in their use, while the cyanoborohydride anion exhibited a worse ID time due to its poor performance with regard to viscosity. In particular, N(CN2) anion compounds 3d and 3a had ignition-delay times of 18 ms and 28 ms respectively, far below 50 ms, which could be comparable with bis(1-allyl-1H-imidazole-3-yl)dihydroboronium dicyanamide (18 ms). Furthermore, as shown in Table 1, the ignition-delay times of these HILs showed an apparent increase with increase in the length of the side chain of the imidazole ring, and the ID time of the HIL was also profoundly affected by the unsaturated side chain of the imidazole ring, with both compounds 3b and 3d possessing shorter ignition-delay times than the other ionic liquids. Interestingly, the ame for the cyanoborohydride anions was brighter (Fig. 6) than those of the dicyandiamide ionic liquids, which might be a result of the high boron content in these HILs.
To investigate the difference of viscosity between dicyandiamide and cyanoborohydride anion, NCI (non-covalent interaction) analysis was conducted. Moreover, the natural population charges of cations and BH3CN anion were further calculated to demonstrate the excellent performance in the ignition delay times. As shown in Fig. 6, the negative charge in the B-H bonds contributed to the superior performance of the ID time for these asymmetric [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+-cation-based ionic liquids, as displayed using CYLview 1.0. However, higher viscosity restricted the application of these cyanoborohydride HILs. The viscosity had a signicant inuence on the performance of the hypergolic ionic liquids mentioned above. For these ionic liquids, the cyanoborohydride anion had a higher consistency than that of the dicyandiamide anion, as shown in Table 1.

was 305.4 s g cm3, which is higher than for UDMH (258.5 s g cm3). In particular, the BH3CN anion had a higher boron content than the dicyandiamide anion, resulting from a higher vacuum-specic impulse, as shown in Table 1.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a novel type of asymmetric boronium-cation-based ionic liquid was successfully synthesized. With respect to the melting points, heats of formation, and decomposition temperatures, the unsaturated side chains of the alkyl imidazole and the asymmetric structures of the cations were shown to play a vital role in these aspects, through theoretical and experimental analysis. Moreover, all the hypergolic ionic liquids had higher heats of formation and higher densities than UDMH. Overall, the (1-allyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium-1-yl)(1-methyl1H-imidazol-3-ium-1-yl) dihydroboronium dicyandiamide possessed the lowest ignition-delay time (18 ms) and the highest density (1.114 g cm3), as well as the highest heat of formation, among the asymmetric ionic liquids. This means that it is a promising material for use as a propellant and these asymmetrical boronium cations can be taken into consideration for the design of new hypergolic ionic liquids.
Conflicts of interest
There are no conicts to declare.

3.5. Specic impulse
Using the NASA-CEA program, by taking advantage of the values of the heat of formation and density, both the vacuum-specic impulse and density-specic impulse of these asymmetric [bis(imidazolyl)-BH2]+-cation-based hypergolic ionic liquids can be obtained, which are superior to those of traditional hypergolic ionic liquids and UDMH. From Table 1, most of the hypergolic ionic liquids synthesized here nearly met the requirements for use in rocket fuel. Even for compound 3b, the density-specic impulse

Effect of fluoropolymer content on thermal and combustion performance of direct writing highsolid nanothermite composite
Yuke Jiao,a Shengnan Li,a Guoping Li *ab and Yunjun Luo ab
The addition of fluoropolymers can improve the reactivity of Al and enhance the combustion performance of thermites, which has attracted great interest. Also, direct writing 3D printing technology for the preparation of energetic materials is an innovative process that can meet a variety of complex requirements. In this study, soluble Viton F2311 was used as a binder, and F2311/Al/CuO (FMICs) nanocomposites were prepared by direct writing. The components of FMICs were evenly distributed without obvious agglomeration. The thermal and combustion properties of FMICs with different mass fractions of F2311 were systematically studied. As the F2311 content increases, the thermite reaction of FMICs is advanced and the system has a higher exothermic and combustion rate. The F2311 content had little effect on the combustion flame temperature of FMICs, all of which were above 2400 K. Compared with PTFE and new fluoropolymers/nanothermites, F2311/nanothermites shows better processability and reaction properties and probably has promising applications.

1 Introduction
Nanothermite, also known as metastable intermixed composite (MIC), is an energetic material composed of nano-sized metal fuel (mostly Al, Mg, Ni, etc.) and oxide (CuO, WO3, Fe2O3, etc.), which is a very promising reactive material with high exothermic reaction and high energy efficiency.1 However, there are some problems with nanothermites in practical applications. (1) The nanoparticles are not uniform in size and tend to agglomerate, making them susceptible to uneven mixing during material processing and difficult to load due to their high viscosity.2 (2) The dense oxide layer formed on the Al surface prevents contact and diffusion between the reactive Al and the oxidizer, resulting in inefficient reactions.3 (3) Al tends to melt and agglomerate during combustion, causing incomplete combustion.4,5 Accordingly, many approaches have been carried out to improve the processability and reactivity of nanocomposites, such as increasing the reactivity of Al,6 preparing novel composite structures,7 and introducing multiple components.8,9 Among them, the introduction of uoropolymers as binders for complexes has attracted a lot of attention. The addition of polymer binders enhances the plasticity and safety of thermites.10 Furthermore, Yagodnikov11 and Glotov12 suggested that the addition of uoropolymers could reduce the

agglomeration of Al during combustion and effectively improve the combustion performance of thermites.9,13
In the past few decades, a series of thermite composites containing different uoropolymers have been prepared. Huang14 used cold-pressing and sintering technology to prepare polytetrauoroethylene (PTFE)/Al/MoO3 composites with a volume ratio of 60 : 16 : 24. The sample can react vigorously when impacted, with the characteristic drop height being 51.57 cm. PTFE has a high melting point (327 C), which is close to the self-ignition temperature of nanothermites, and it is almost insoluble in any solvent. On the contrary, polyvinylidene uoride (PVDF) and Viton can dissolve in some organic solvents, which provides more ideas for the application of nanothermites. Chen15 added the nanothermite to PVDF polymer solution and prepared Al/MoO3/PVDF composites by electrostatic spraying, and it was shown that the addition of PVDF could signicantly reduce the reaction activation energy and contribute to the thermite reaction. The incorporation of nanothermite into polymer solutions for compounding can solve the problem of nanoparticle dispersion in composites, resulting in a more uniform distribution of material components, closer contact between fuel and oxidizer, and the composites with higher reactivity.2,16,17 Currently, more research is focused on PTFE or PVDF/Al composites. Some novel uoropolymers have been studied, however, due to their insoluble and refractory characteristics, the preparation of complexes is limited to high-temperature casting or ultrasonic mixing methods.18-20 There are few studies on easily soluble uoropolymer/nanothermite composites.

The selection of the appropriate polymer and processing method is critical to the nanothermites properties. F2311 has non-toxic, good storage stability, and physical and mechanical properties. It can be dissolved in solvents such as ketones and esters with low boiling points. In the eld of energetic materials, it has been combined with high-energy explosives such as HMX and CL-20 as polymer-bonded explosives.21,22 Meanwhile, the direct writing of solvent-based inks has aroused great interest because of its relative simplicity and convenience. Moreover, the safety of energetic materials can be signicantly improved with the addition of solvents.16,17,23 Compared with traditional charging methods, such as casting and pressing of energetic materials, direct writing technology relies on its micro-nozzle and exible arm, which has great potential advantages for micro-miniature applications of energetic materials.
In this study, soluble F2311 was selected as a uorinecontaining binder to prepare high solid content F2311/Al/CuO composites (FMICs) by direct writing. The components of FMICs are uniformly distributed and tightly combined, and there is no obvious agglomeration of nanoparticles, which provides favorable conditions for the uniform combustion of materials. The effects of F2311 content on the thermal and combustion performances of FMICs were systematically studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), constant volume combustion, and highspeed photography, and the combustion process of FMICs was analyzed.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Materials and chemicals
F2311 was purchased from Chenguang Chemical Research Institute. It is an elastomer made by copolymerization of vinylidene uoride (VDF) and chlorotriuoroethylene (CTFE). The chemical formula of F2311 is shown in Fig. 1. Butyl acetate (AR) and CuO with a diameter of 50-100 nm were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd; Al nanoparticles have an average diameter of 100 nm were purchased from Shanghai Maoguo Nano Technology Co., Ltd.
2.2 Preparation of F2311/Al/CuO
According to the formulation in Table 1, F2311 was added to the butyl acetate and magnetically stirred for 3 hours to obtain a clear solution. Then the Al and CuO nanoparticles (equivalence ratio 2.0) were added to the above polymer solution and ultrasounded for 1 h to form the energetic ink. Printing was conducted with a 3D printer (Adventure Technology) using

2.3 Characterization
The rheological properties of pure polymer solutions and highly loaded inks were tested using HAAKE rotational rheometer with a 20 mm diameter steel plate. The shear rate-viscosity test was carried out in the shear rate range from 0.01 to 100 s1 at room temperature. The printing sample was observed by Hitachi SU8020 scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled to an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the samples were detected on a Nicolet is50 FT-IR instrument, and the ATR spectra shown here were collected at a resolution of 4 cm1 and averaged over 32 scans. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) test was performed on FMICs using a PHI QUANTERA-II SXM (ULVAC-PHI, Japan) with an Al Ka source. Thermal analysis of composite materials was detected by Mettler-Toledo simultaneous thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimeter (TGA/DSC1) at 10 C min1 heating rate under 40 ml min1 Ar ow from 30 C to 800 C. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) test used the Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer, a Cu target wavelength of 0.154 nm, and a scanning range of 20-100. Constant pressure combustion test was performed with a laboratory-made closed combustion chamber (cylindrical cavity combustion chamber, F32 mm  16 mm), 25 mg of samples were weighed, used American Tektronix company MDO3000 Model oscilloscope, Jiangsu Union Energy Electronic Technology Co., Ltd YE5850 model quasi-static charge amplier to obtain the pressure signal in the reaction process. The i-SPEED 726 high-speed camera was used to record the combustion process in air, with a shutter speed of 15 000 fps and a focal length of 50 mm. The ame temperature was measured by a 50 mm METIS H3 high-speed infrared pyrometer.

3 Results and discussion
3.1 Ink rheology and characterization of FMICs
Energetic ink is a novel concept for additive manufacturing of energetic materials, which usually includes three parts: explosives or reactive materials, adhesives, and solvents. The materials that can be prepared by direct writing largely depend on the rheological properties of the prepared ink. Fig. 3a shows the dynamic shear viscosity of F2311 polymer solution and energetic ink with 80 wt% nanothermite. Both pure polymer solutions and energetic ink exhibit shear thinning characteristics. The addition of nanoparticles greatly increased the viscosity of the ink. The extremely strong shear thinning of the ink made it similar to the viscosity of the polymer at high shear rates. This feature is very suitable for direct writing of pass through millimeter or even micron nozzles under certain pressure conditions.2,16,24
Fig. 3b is the photograph of FMICs by direct writing. Fig. 3c and d show low and high magnication SEM images of the surface of the double-layer FMICs. The F2311 binder was tightly wrapped with the nanothermite to provide a self-supporting structure for the composite material. At the same time, the Al and CuO nanoparticles were tightly assembled. From the EDS results of each element (Fig. 3e), it can be seen that the components of the FMICs obtained by direct writing were uniformly distributed, and there was no obvious agglomeration phenomenon between the nanoparticles.
The elements composition of FMICs was analyzed by XPS. Fig. 4a shows the survey spectrum of the surface of FMICs, which clearly shows that FMICs contain C, O, F, Cu, and Al elements. The high-resolution XPS spectra of FMICs was further tted with Gaussian, and the result is shown in Fig. 4b. The results correspond to C-C, C-F, and CF2 at 285.0 (0.2) eV, 287.0 (0.2) eV, and 291.4 (0.2) eV, respectively. Fig. 4c shows the FTIR spectra of F2311 and FMICs. The -CF2 stretching vibration peak of FMICs is shied toward the lower wavenumber due to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between C-F on the molecular chain of F2311 and -OH on the surface of

nano Al and CuO. It indicates that there is an interaction between F2311 and nano-Al thermite, which is benecial to the long-term storage of the ink.
3.2 Thermal analysis of FMICs with different F2311 content To study the thermal properties and combustion reaction process of nanocomposites, TG-DSC thermal analysis of FMICs with different F2311 contents were characterized, and the combustion products were analyzed by XRD. The results are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.
The TG-DTG results (Fig. 5a and b) indicated that the thermal decomposition process of FMICs can be divided into three stages. The rst stage (100-300 C) mainly removes small molecules such as water and organic solvents adsorbed on the surface of the material during the preparation and storage of

releasing a large amount of heat (Fig. 5c peak 1 hightemperature section). This process is known as the preignition reaction (PIR), which is shown in eqn (1) and (2).

FMICs. The second stage (300-385 C) is the F2311 thermally decomposes (the weight loss is related to the F2311 content of the composite, which is about 97 wt% of the F2311) and reacts with the Al2O3 shell on the surface of Al and releases an amount of heat (Fig. 5c peak 1 low-temperature section). At this point, the oxide layer is destroyed, the reactive Al is exposed to the binder and oxidizer and the uorination of the Al takes place,

According to the thermal weight-loss parameters in Table 2,
the decomposition temperature of FMICs are lower than that of
pure F2311 polymer. The addition of nanothermite can facili-
tate the thermal decomposition of F2311. When the mass fraction of nanothermite increases from 80% to 95%, the DTG peak temperature of F2311 decreased by about 92-118 C, and the peak temperature of uorination reaction decreased by 14.27 C. The decrease in decomposition temperature of F2311
can be attributed to the PIR, which can also be observed in the reaction of Al with PTFE, PVDF, and other uoropolymers.18,25,26
It can be seen from Fig. 5c peak 1 that with the increasing content of F2311, the more heat released from uorination reaction, the higher the total heat released from FMICs. When
the mass fraction of F2311 increased from 5% to 20%, the total heat increased from 913.18 J g1 to 1747.19 J g1. F2311 is
capable of PIR with Al and Al2O3 shell layer, and the reaction product AlF3 sublimates at 1277 C, which makes the system internally pressurized while the particles break up and reduce

agglomeration. The incorporation of F2311 contributed to the higher reaction energy and better combustion properties of the nanothermite composites.9,13,27
The third stage (385-580 C) is the further decomposition of F2311 polymer, and the weight loss rate is about 3 wt% of F2311 in FMICs. The increase in mass (above 600 C) is since although the argon atmosphere is used for purging, there is inevitably a trace of air in the furnace cavity, which reacts with Al under high-temperature conditions. When the temperature is higher than 600 C, FMICs undergo the thermite reaction and release heat (Fig. 5c peak 2), as shown in eqn (4), as the content of F2311 increases, the thermite reaction advances.

The XRD results in Fig. 6 show that the combustion product of 5 wt% F2311 contains Cu2O and relatively more Cu9Al4 compared to other mass fractions of F2311. It is reported that Cu9Al4 is a product in the fuel-rich Al/CuO nanothermite composites, which is formed by the reaction of excess Al and Cu2O, as shown in eqn (4) and (5).18,28 FMICs with F2311 content above 5 wt% recorded the lowest relative peak intensity for Al2O3 with respect to AlF3, which indicates that uorination is the dominant mechanism for Al consumption over oxidation. This is also consistent with the stronger peak intensities observed for the PIR in the DSC result (Fig. 5c).

3.3 Constant volume combustion performance of FMICs
The pressure-time curves (P-t curves) for FMICs were obtained by using a constant-volume combustion chamber equipped with a pressure sensor, as shown in Fig. 7. It can be observed that the pressure proles of FMICs with different F2311 content progress smoothly over time without any oscillation, indicating that the nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed in the F2311 binder matrix.18
All samples showed a process of sharp increase and gradual decay in the pressure curves. The increase in pressure can be attributed to the following factors: (1) the heat released during combustion increases the temperature of the gas in the combustion chamber. (2) The combustion process forms shock waves at the high temperature and pressure reaction. (3) Gas products: the adiabatic temperature of the thermite reaction is higher than the boiling point of Al (2327 C), so the part of Al vaporizes during the reaction; in the presence of F2311, Al is not only oxidized by CuO but also undergoes uorination reaction

with F2311 to produce gaseous AlF3. In addition, the binder will generate several uorine-containing gases.
Typically, the maximum pressure generated (Pmax) represents the release of reaction energy; the time to reach Pmax and the pressure rise rate (dP/dt) are indicators for the reactivity of the energetic material. The parameters of the P-t curves of FMICs with different F2311 content are shown in Fig. 8. Pmax tends to increase with increasing F2311 content. This is consistent with the pattern of exothermic values of FMICs reported in the previous section. The addition of more F2311 causes FMICs to generate more heat and gaseous products during combustion, which leads to a higher Pmax. The binder hinders the propagation of heat, which affects the reactivity of the material. Therefore 5 wt% F2311 composites showed relatively high reactivity (dP dt1). Favorably, the PIR occurring between the uoropolymer and Al particles provides the additional heat. When the F2311 content is 10 wt% or more, the PIR reaction is more intense, and more heat is released as the F2311 content increases, so the reactivity increases accordingly. When the mass fraction of F2311 reached 20%, the positive effect from

PIR was greater than the negative effect from the binder, thus improving the overall reactivity.
3.4 Combustion process of FMICs
The combustion process of FMICs under normal pressure was recorded by high-speed photography. Fig. 9 is a series of highspeed photographs showing FMICs of the same mass (25 mg) ignited by Ni-Cr wire in the atmosphere. It can be observed that the burning duration of FMICs were within 100 ms, the ame was bright yellow, and the closer to the burning surface, the greater the ame brightness; there are splashed particles in the gas phase region, which was because the gaseous substances generated during the combustion of FMICs bring them into the gas phase region and continue to burn fully. Taking the rst screen where the burning bright spot appears as the zero moment, as the F2311 content decreases, the shorter the time for FMICs to reach the most intense burning. Because according to the TG curve we understand that the thermite can facilitate the decomposition of F2311, thereby promoting the preignition reaction; While with the increase of F2311 content, FMICs can burn out faster and have higher burning rate. The ame temperature was measured by infrared thermometer, and the results are shown in Fig. 10. The mass fraction of F2311 had little effect on the ame temperature of FMICs, which were all higher than 2400 K.
Table 3 summarizes the thermal and combustion properties of PTFE, PVDF, and novel uoropolymer compounded with nanothermites reported in the literature in recent years. All these uoropolymers have PIR and thermal reaction processes. Among them, F2311/nanothermites composites have more obvious advantages in terms of heat release as well as combustion rate. For example, F2311/nanothermites exerts 87% to 353% more heat than PTFE and PVDF-based composites. In addition, compared with PTFE and other novel uoropolymer, they are mostly prepared by ultrasonic mixing due to their insolubility and high melting point. F2311 is easily soluble in

organic solvents, thus F2311/nanothermites composites could have a greater potential for application.
4 Conclusions
(1) The nanocomposite energetic materials were successfully prepared by direct writing. SEM and EDS showed that the components of FMICs were uniformly distributed. (2) The thermal properties of F2311 and FMICs were studied by TGDSC. Nanothermite can facilitate the decomposition of F2311. With the increase of F2311 content, the PIR releases more heat, the thermite reaction advances, and the total energy of the system increases. When the mass fraction of F2311 increased from 5% to 20%, the heat exotherm of PIR increased by 890.00%, the total heat exotherm of the system increased by 91.33%, and the peak temperature of the thermite reaction decreased by 7.52 C. (3) The combustion products of FMICs were analyzed by XRD. The nanothermite composites with a mass fraction of 5-20% F2311 (the equivalent ratio of the thermite is 2.0) is a fuel-rich system. When the mass fraction of F2311 is greater than 5%, the uorination of Al is the main mechanism for consuming Al. (4) The combustion performance of FMICs was characterized by a closed combustion chamber and high-speed photography. The maximum pressure produced by combustion rose with the increase of F2311 content, and the appropriate addition of F2311 could improve the reaction activity of FMICs. The combustion process of FMICs with different F2311 mass fractions is within 100 ms, and with the increase of F2311 content, the average combustion rate is faster, while the time to reach the strongest combustion is longer.

Efficient and stable perovskite solar cells using manganese-doped nickel oxide as the hole transport layer
You-Wei Wu, Chih-Yu Chang, Fu-Bing Chiu and Sheng-Hsiung Yang *
Organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have represented a promising field of renewable energy in recent years due to the compelling advantages of high efficiency, facile fabrication process and low cost. The development of inorganic p-type metal oxide materials plays an important role in the performance and stability of PSCs for commercial purposes. Herein a facile and effective way to improve hole extraction and conductivity of NiOx films by manganese (Mn) doping is demonstrated in this study. A Mn-doped NiOx layer was prepared by the sol-gel process and served as the hole transport layer (HTL) in inverted PSCs. The results suggest that Mn-doped NiOx is helpful for the growth of perovskite layers with larger grains and higher crystallinity compared with the pristine NiOx. Furthermore, the perovskite films deposited on Mn-doped NiOx exhibit lower recombination and shorter carrier lifetime. The device based on 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx as the HTL displayed the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.35% and a high fill factor (FF) of 81%, which were significantly higher than those of the one using the pristine NiOx HTL (PCE  14.71%, FF  73%). Moreover, the device retained 70% of its initial efficiency after 35 days' storage under a continuous halogen lamp matrix exposure with an illumination intensity of 1000 W m2. Our results widen the development of PSCs for future production.

1. Introduction
Photovoltaic cells based on perovskite materials have attracted a great deal of attention from academic and industrial researchers owing to their advantageous features of high absorption behavior in the visible spectrum, long carrier diffusion length, high carrier mobility, low exciton binding energy, tunable bandgaps by exchanging materials composition, and low fabrication cost.1-5 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been remarkably developed from 3.8% to 25.5% within a decade.6,7 The PCE of PSCs has exceeded that of inorganic thin-lm photovoltaics on a laboratory scale and is comparable to that of commercialized silicon solar cells by miscellaneous techniques, including optimization of device structure, interface engineering, and passivation of materials.8-10
The chemical formula of perovskite absorbing materials is ABX3, where A stands for an organic-inorganic monovalent cation, B symbolizes a divalent metal cation, and X represents a monovalent anion.11 Single cationic perovskite materials like methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and formamidinium

lead iodide (FAPbI3) have been utilized as the active layer in PSCs with PCE values up to 18.7% and 17.11%, respectively.12,13

However, the PSCs based on single cationic perovskite materials

usually encounter unavoidable drawback of poor thermal and

humidity stability that limits their further development in

photovoltaic application.14 In order to solve these problems and

achieve high device performance, Yi et al. proposed a mixed

cation perovskite CsxFA1픵PbX3 as the light absorber in PSCs.15

The material possesses good thermal stability over the investigated temperature range of 20 to 250 C and the optimized

device exhibited a high PCE of 17.35% as well as long-term

stability of 1000 hours in the dark under ambient environ-

ment without encapsulation. Saliba et al. incorporated

a mixture of a triple Cs/MA/FA cation into perovskite absorbing

layer, conrming an initial PCE of 21.1% and a stabilized PCE of

18% aer 250 hours of aging under full illumination in

a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature.16 Obviously, the

adoption of multiple cation perovskite materials is essential for

PSCs to enter global photovoltaic market in the future.

The inverted PSC with p-i-n structure of anode/hole trans-

port layer (HTL)/perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL)/

cathode has been extensively developed within a decade

because of its simple device structure, little hysteresis effect and

free of high-temperature processing.17 Besides, PSCs can be

combined with silicon-based, copper indium gallium selenide,

or other kinds of solar cells to construct high-efficiency solar

cells

ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been widely used as the HTL in inverted PSCs owing to the
advantages of easy processing and matched energy level with the perovskite.21,22 However, it is also reported that the hygro-
scopic and acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS may deteriorate the transparent conducting oxide electrode, such as uorine-doped
tin oxide (FTO) and indium tin oxide (ITO), leading to degradation of device performance.23,24 In contrast to organic
PEDOT:PSS, inorganic p-type nickel oxide (NiOx) has been extensively employed as the HTL because of its superior hole
extraction ability, high transmittance in the visible range, and environmental stability.25,26 Until now, there have been several methods to prepare NiOx HTL for inverted PSCs, such as sol-gel deposition, atomic layer deposition, spray pyrolysis, and nanoparticle dispersion.27-30 The intrinsic hole mobility of solution-processed NiOx is reported to be 105 to 103 cm2 V1 s1,31 and therefore doping process is usually adopted to increase holes mobility and hole extraction ability associated
with reduced carrier recombination to achieve higher device performance of PSCs.32 Teo et al. reported inverted PSCs using
La-doped NiOx as the HTL and the reduction in internal resistance resulted in enhanced conductivity of the HTL aer La doping.33 The PSC based on 3 mol% La-doped NiOx displayed a promising PCE of 15.46% and retained 95% of its initial PCE aer 50 days storage in a moisture-free desiccator. Park et al. demonstrated solution-processed Li-doped NiOx as the HTL in PSCs.34 The improved electrical conductivity of NiOx was conrmed by conductive atomic force microscope, and the
device based on 5% Li-doped NiOx exhibited an average PCE of 14.66%, which was improved by 21% compared to the pristine
NiOx. Thiruchelvan et al. utilized the solution-processed Zndoped NiOx as the HTL for fabricating inverted PSCs with an average PCE of 14.67%.35 They found that Zn doping is able to improve carrier extraction and conductivity without any negative effect on the optical properties of NiOx. Apart from single doping, some researchers select co-doping to further improve conductivity of NiOx layers. For example, Zn-Ce, Li-Co or Li- Co-Mg dopants have been incorporated into NiOx as the HTL and the corresponding PSCs showed enhanced PCE values from 7.47-17.4% to 13.22-20.1%.36-38 The introducing amounts of different dopants should be carefully controlled to prevent overdosed doping that usually reduces device performance.
In this study, manganese(II) acetate tetrahydrate was rstly chosen as an additive to form Mn-doped NiOx lm as the HTL in PSCs. Different molar ratio of the Mn dopant from 0.5 to 2 mol% was incorporated to investigate the effect of Mn doping
on the morphological, optical and electrical properties of the
NiOx HTL. As mentioned in the previous part, ion doping can enhance carrier extraction ability and conductivity of metal oxide semiconductors. Besides, Mn-containing perovskite
materials have been reported to serve as the light absorbing layer for the fabrication of PSCs,39 implying that Mn ions would
not damage the perovskite layer even if Mn ions are released from NiOx lattice. To fabricate highly efficient inverted PSCs, 6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) was chosen as the ETL and tetrabutylammonium tetrauoroborate
(TBABF4) was doped to improve electron extraction of PC61BM.

Furthermore, polyethylenimine (PEI) was incorporated as the interfacial layer between PC61BM and Ag electrode. The inverted devices with the architecture of FTO/un-doped or Mn-doped NiOx/perovskite/PC61BM + TBABF4/PEI/Ag were fabricated and evaluated. The best PCE value of 17.35% was obtained using 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx as the HTL. Moreover, the device under the halogen lamps matrix irradiation with an illumination intensity of 1000 W m2 sustained 70% of its initial efficiency aer 35 days storage, which reveals better stability than the control device using pristine NiOx HTL.

second step was set at 4500 rpm for 20 s. During the second step, 300 mL of ethyl acetate was dripped on the spinning substrate and the color of the perovskite layer became brown immediately. The deposited thin lm was then annealed at 105 C for 1 hour and dark brown perovskite layer was observed.

The device structure of PSCs in this study is FTO/un-doped or Mn-doped MiOx/perovskite/PC61BM + TBABF4/PEI/Ag. FTOcoated glass substrates were cleaned in advance in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol (IPA) for 10 min each under ultra-sonication, followed by UV-ozone exposure for 25 min. Next, un-doped or Mn-doped NiOx HTLs were deposited on the FTO substrates according to the procedure in the 2.2 section. Aerward, the deposition of the perovskite layer was referred to the procedure in the 2.3 section. The PC61BM solution (20 mg mL1) containing 2 mol% of TBABF4 in chlorobenzene was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by heating at 100 C for 10 min. 0.1 mol% of PEI in anhydrous IPA was then spin-coated on the PCBM layer at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 100 nm of Ag electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 6  106 torr. The active area of each device was dened by a shadow mask with an open area of 4.5 mm2. Besides, hole- and electrononly devices with the conguration of FTO/un-doped or Mndoped NiOx/Ag and FTO/PC61BM + TBABF4/PEI/Ag were fabricated, respectively, and their current-voltage (I-V) characteristics were measured for comparison.

The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of PSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight exposure (Yamashita Denso YSS100A equipped with a Xenon Short Arc lamp 1000 W) at 100 mW cm2 under ambient environment. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed on a PV Measurement QE-R instrument which was assembled by Enli Technology Co., Ltd. from Taiwan. To investigate the stability of devices, encapsulated PSCs were constantly exposed to a halogen lamps matrix with an illumination intensity of 1000 W m2 at room temperature with 40-70% relative humidity and their J-V characteristics were measured in each 24-h period.

the carrier-only devices. Fig. 1(a) depicts the I-V characteristics of the hole-only FTO/un-doped or Mn-doped NiOx/Ag and electron-only FTO/PC61BM + TBABF4/PEI/Ag devices, while the inset shows the corresponding device structure. It is clearly seen that Mn-doped NiOx device possesses higher slope than the undoped one, meaning that Mn doping can enhance conductivity and charge transport ability of NiOx. The conductivity of the hole-only device increased with increasing the concentration of Mn dopant. Besides, we notice that the hole-only devices based on Mn-doped NiOx showed closer conductivity to the electrononly device FTO/PC61BM + TBABF4/PEI/Ag, implying that equivalent carriers transport capabilities were achieved, and therefore the hysteresis effect in our nal p-i-n device of FTO/ Mn-doped NiOx/perovskite/PC61BM + TBABF4/PEI/Ag could be reduced. The hole mobility (mh) of NiOx lms was approximated from the space charge limited current (SCLC) model dened as follows,41

J  (9/8)330mh(V2/L3)

(1)

where J is the current density; V is the bias voltage; 30 and 3 are the vacuum dielectric constant and the relative dielectric constant of NiOx, respectively; L is the thickness of the NiOx lm ($30 nm). The curves of ln(JL3/V2) versus electric eld (V/L)0.5 were derived by the SCLC model and displayed in Fig. 1(b).42 The mh of 0.5, 1 and 2 mol% Mn-doped NiOx was estimated to be 8.77  103, 9.45  103, and 1.07  102 cm2 V1 s1, respectively, which was higher than the un-doped NiOx (8.22  103 cm2 V1 s1). The augmented mh value of Mn-doped NiOx is expected to bring on Jsc enhancement which is benecial to device performance of PSCs.
The transmission and absorption experiments were carried
out to realize the optical spectra of the un-doped and Mn-doped
NiOx on the FTO substrate, as depicted in Fig. 2. The transmittance of the un-doped NiOx in Fig. 2(a) was observed to be 68% at 400 nm and 80% at 600 nm. It can be seen that the
transmittance of NiOx increases as the concentration of Mn dopant increases. The Mn-doped NiOx lms have higher transmittance of 69-71% at 400 nm and even higher transmittance of 84-86% at 600 nm, indicative of anti-reection
phenomenon through Mn doping. Furthermore, higher trans-
mittance of the Mn-doped NiOx HTL in the visible range facilitates incident photons to pass through and to be absorbed by
the perovskite layer. Fig. 2(b) displays the absorption spectra of the un-doped and Mn-doped NiOx lms. The optical bandgaps (Eg) of NiOx lms can be derived from their absorption edge around 350 nm to be ca. 3.54 eV that is consistent with previous reports.25,43 It is clearly seen that the Eg of NiOx was not significantly affected by Mn doping. Besides, a slight absorption band was observed at 420 nm, indicative of Ni3+ species.44,45
The XPS measurements were employed to investigate the
elemental properties of Ni, O, and Mn atoms in the un-doped and 0.5% Mn-doped NiOx lms. It is well known that hole transport ability of nonstoichiometric NiOx comes from the existence of Ni3+ (Ni2O3 species) in the crystalline structure.46 The high-resolution Ni 2p3/2 spectra for the un-doped and Mndoped NiOx are displayed in Fig. 3(a) and (d), respectively, and

the multicomponent band was deconvoluted into four different states at 854.2 (Ni2+), 855.8 (Ni3+), 861.34 (Ni2+ satellite), and 864.25 eV (Ni3+ satellite), which are in agreement with previous literature.47-49 The Ni3+/Ni2+ ratios for the un-doped and Mndoped NiOx lms were calculated to be 2.21 and 2.26, respectively. The slightly increased Ni3+ concentration in the Mndoped NiOx indicates that the incorporated Mn2+ ions occupied the original Ni2+ sites, inducing Ni2+ to convert into Ni3+ to keep electroneutrality of NiOx. Similar phenomenon has been reported by Wang, Sun and their co-workers who utilized Mgdoped NiOx as the HTL for perovskite photodetectors.26 In this work, the increased Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio means that Mn doping promotes hole transport ability of NiOx.50 The high-resolution O 1s spectra of the un-doped and Mn-doped NiOx are presented in Fig. 3(b) and (e), respectively. By deconvoluting the O 1s signal, two prominent peaks at 530 and 531.7 eV are observed that are attributed to the NiO and Ni2O3 species, respectively.49 Fig. 3(c) and (f) demonstrate the Mn 2p spectra of the un-doped and Mndoped NiOx, respectively. The above Mn 2p3/2 signal is

embedded within the Ni LMM signal in the range of 640 and
644.7 eV and it is necessary to deconvolute the whole spectrum to nd out its real location.51 No Mn 2p signal was found in
Fig. 3(c), while Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 signals are located at 641.7 and 652.8 eV, as shown in Fig. 3(f).52 The observation of
the two Mn 2p signals proves that Mn atoms were successfully
integrated into the NiOx lattice. To realize the effect of Mn doping on the work function (4w)
of NiOx lms, KPFM technique was performed and the contact potential difference (CPD) distribution images of the un-doped and 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx lms are presented in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively.53 The CPD is determined by the interaction
force between sample surface and a Pt-coated conductive cantilever probe, which is dened as CPD  (4tip  4sample)/픢 and e is the electronic charge.54 The CPD variation for the undoped NiOx lm was found to be unevenly distributed between 65.3 and 127.6 mV, whereas that for the 0.5 mol% Mndoped NiOx lm was homogeneously distributed between a smaller scale range of 24.4 and 15 mV. Moreover, the 4w difference between the un-doped and 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx is estimated by the CPD to be 0.094 eV from KPFM experiment.
It is seen that Mn doping can bring a lower surface potential prole and an up-shied 4w of NiOx lm. To further conrm the 4w and energy levels of NiOx lms, UPS experiments were conducted and the acquired spectra are shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). The 4w can be derived by subtracting the binding energy cutoff in the high binding energy region (around 17 eV) from the
monochromatic He I photon energy (21.22 eV). It is known that the 4w is dened as the energy difference between the Fermi level (EF) and the vacuum level (0 eV). Therefore, the EF of the

un-doped NiOx is calculated to be 4.02 eV from Fig. 4(c). By adding 0.5, 1 and 2 mol% Mn dopants, the EF of the modied NiOx are estimated to be 3.87, 3.75, and 3.6 eV, respectively. The low binding energy cutoff (around 1 eV) is related to the energy difference between the EF and valence band (VB). As a result, the VB of the un-doped and 0.5-2 mol% Mn-doped NiOx are derived to be 4.89, 4.93, 5.01, and 5.01 eV from Fig. 4(d), respectively. A downward shi of VB by Mn doping is benecial to charge extraction and photovoltaic performance due to better energy level alignment between NiOx HTL and perovskite layer (VB $ 5.4 eV).55
To discuss the effect of Mn doping on the surface morphology and crystallinity of NiOx, top-view SEM images as well as XRD patterns of the un-doped and Mn-doped NiOx were obtained as Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI, respectively. Very thin NiOx layers were deposited on the FTO substrates and the grains of low-lying FTO are clearly seen. It is difficult to verify whether Mn doping affects the morphology of NiOx. In Fig. S2, all samples show three diffraction peaks at 2q  37.0, 43.3, and 62.9, which corresponds to (111), (200), and (220) planes.50,56 Besides, no additional diffraction peak was formed upon Mn doping, indicating that the crystallinity of NiOx was not altered in the doping process.
3.2. Characterization of perovskite layers on NiOx
Fig. 5 reveals the top-view SEM images of the perovskite on the un-doped and Mn-doped NiOx layers. It is clearly seen that the perovskites on the Mn-doped NiOx have larger grains compared with that on the un-doped NiOx. The larger perovskite crystals

are helpful for reducing charge recombination, which ensures effective carrier extraction and transport.57 In addition to SEM
observation, XRD experiment was carried out to analyze the crystallinity of perovskites on different NiOx. Fig. 6 demonstrates the XRD patterns of perovskite layers on the un-doped and 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx. Several intense diffraction peaks are observed at 2q  14.08, 19.94, 24.54, 28.4, 31.81, 34.91, 40.64, and 43.17, corresponding to (001), (011), (111),
(002), (012), (112), (022), and (003) planes of the perovskite Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14Pb(Br0.15I0.85)3. The diffraction peaks of the prepared perovskites in this study are consistent with previous reports.49,58 Furthermore, the perovskite on the 0.5 mol% Mndoped NiOx shows stronger diffraction signals than that on the pristine NiOx, implying that Mn-doped NiOx is protable for the growth of perovskite layers with higher crystallinity.
Fig. 7(a) displays the steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite layer deposited on the FTO, un-doped and Mn-doped NiOx lms with different doping concentration. The decreased PL intensity
reveals charge extraction and transport from the perovskite
layer to the HTL, which has been extensively discussed in previous literature.27,41 It can be seen that the perovskite cast on
the FTO substrate has the highest PL intensity. By casting the
perovskite layer on the un-doped NiOx, the PL intensity was signicantly lowered due to carrier extraction. By depositing the
perovskite on the Mn-doped NiOx, the PL emission was further prohibited, indicative of higher carrier extraction and reduced charge recombination, which bring benets to short-circuit current density (JSC) and ll factor (FF) of PSCs. The lowest PL emission was observed for the perovskite on the 0.5 mol% Mndoped NiOx lm. To further verify PL results of perovskite lms on various substrates, the TR-PL decay technique was applied
and the corresponding decay curves are depicted in Fig. 7(b). The PL decay curves are tted by a biexponential model and the obtained decay constants s1, s2, and savg are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI. The fast decay constant s1 represents nonradiative capture of free carriers and the slow decay constant s2

is associated with radiative recombination of carriers from the bulk perovskite.26,55 The avPerage lifPetime (savg) was determined with the equation savg  (Aisi2)/ (Aisi), where si and Ai are

deduced from the tted curve data. The savg is calculated to be 91, 52.7, 33.1, 37.7, and 51.3 ns for the perovskite lms on the FTO, un-doped, 0.5, 1, and 2 mol% Mn-doped NiOx, respectively, which is in accordance with the downtrend of PL emission in Fig. 7(a). It is widely known that the shorter carrier lifetime exhibits more efficient charge extraction. The perovskite lm on the 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx owns the most efficient charge extraction among all samples because of the shortest carrier lifetime, indicative of higher device performance of PSCs.
3.3. Device evaluation
The inverted (p-i-n) PSC with the architecture of FTO/un-doped or Mn-doped NiOx/Cs0.05(MA0.85FA0.15)0.95Pb(Br0.15I0.85)3/ PC61BM + TBABF4/PEI/Ag were fabricated and evaluated. The cross-sectional SEM image of the whole device was presented in Fig. 8(a). The thicknesses of the 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx, perovskite, PCBM + TBABF4, PEI, and Ag electrode are estimated

to be 30, 550, 40, 20, and 100 nm, respectively. Fig. 8(b) displays the energy level diagram of the whole PSC using the un-doped or Mn-doped NiOx with different concentrations as the HTL. Compared to the pristine NiOx, the 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx has a downward VB at 4.93 eV that matches better with the perovskite layer (VB  5.4 eV). As mentioned in the UPS part, hole extraction and transport would be improved by reducing energy barrier between the perovskite layer and HTL. To evaluate the charge transport and recombination processes in devices, dark current measurements of PSCs based on the undoped and Mn-doped NiOx HTLs were carried out and the corresponding dark J-V characteristics are displayed in Fig. 8(c). The 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx device showed the lowest leakage current density among all PSCs under the reverse bias from 1 to 0 V, which is benecial for improving charge transport and decreasing recombination loss.59 The J-V characteristic curves of all devices using the pristine and Mn-doped NiOx as the HTL under AM 1.5G illumination are depicted in Fig. 8(d).

Furthermore, the measured photovoltaic parameters including JSC, open-circuit voltage (VOC), FF, PCE, and series resistance (RS) are listed in Table 1. The control device without Mn doping displayed a moderate PCE of 14.71%, a JSC of 20.74 mA cm2, a VOC of 0.96 V, and a FF value of 0.73. The best PSC performance was achieved from the device using 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx as the HTL, revealing a PCE of 17.35% which is signicantly higher than the control device. The JSC, VOC, and FF of the device were measured to be 20.84 mA cm2, 1.027 V, and 0.81, respectively. From the literature survey, we realize that our device based on 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx has a prominent PCE which is higher than those devices with other kinds of doping, such as La, Li, or Li-Co-Mg codoping with PCE values in the range of 13.22-15.39%.33,34,38 The introduced amount of Mn dopant in this study is essentially less than other kinds of dopants. Besides, the PSC based on the 1 mol% Mn-doped NiOx showed a PCE of 15.85%, a JSC of 20.08 mA cm2, a VOC of 1.01 V, and a FF value of 0.78. By further increasing Mn concentration up to 2 mol%, the PCE of the device dropped to 13.82% with a JSC 20.18 mA cm2, a VOC of 0.97 V, and an FF value of 0.7. To assess reproducibility of our PSCs, the statistical distribution for PCE, VOC, JSC, and FF from 20 individual devices was collected and presented in Fig. S3 in the ESI. In particular, our devices based on 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx as the HTL revealed the best reproducibility and higher photovoltaic parameters relative to others. As mentioned in the 3.1 section, the hole mobility of NiOx was increased with the Mn-doped amount. However, device performance of PSCs is determined by many factors, not only the hole mobility. From PL and TR-PL decay experiments, we realized that the perovskite deposited on the 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx has the lowest PL intensity and shortest carrier lifetime. From the dark current measurement of devices, the device based on the 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx also has the lowest leakage current density, implying better charge transport and decreased recombination loss. The above factors all contribute to device performance and hence the PSC based on the 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx HTL received the best device parameters. Fig. 8(e) shows the EQE spectra and integrated current densities of devices using the un-doped and 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx as the HTL. The incident photon-to-electron conversion signal as a function of wavelength is observed in a wide range from 300 to 790 nm. The results demonstrate that the EQE of the 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx device was higher than

the control one, while the highest EQE value of 80% at around 600 nm was obtained. Besides, we notice that the integrated current density obtained from the EQE spectra (17.16 mA cm2 for the control device and 18.89 mA cm2 for the device based on the 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx) are smaller than JSC values. The mismatch between integrated current density and JSC values, originating from different experimental setup, has been reported by Etgar and his coworker.59,60 The J-V measurement of devices is carried out under AM 1.5G irradiation, while the EQE experiment is acquired using Xe lamp as the light source. The acquisition time for EQE experiments is normally longer than that for electrical measurement of devices, and therefore longterm sample degradation may be induced to receive lower integrated current density. The calculated integrated current density less than JSC within 1020% is reasonably accurate. Dai and his coworkers also claimed that the ion migration by the external bias inside the perovskite lms during a relatively long measurement period can result in the decreased integrate current density for the EQE measurement.61 Therefore, the obtained integrated current density that is smaller than JSC within 10-20% is acceptable.60 In this work, the difference between the integrated current density and JSC is found to be 9.4% and 17.3% for devices based on the 0.5 mol% Mn-doped and undoped NiOx HTLs, respectively, which is believable. To explore environmental stability of PSCs, the fabricated PSCs were exposed to a halogen lamps matrix and their J-V characteristics were measured in each 24 h period.55 Fig. 8(f) shows the PCE evolution of PSCs based on the un-doped and 0.5 mol% Mndoped NiOx as the HTL, retaining 55% and 70% of initial PCE aer 35 days exposure, respectively. It is clearly seen that the PSC based on the 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx HTL possesses higher stability than the control one. The potential mechanism of improved stability of Mn-doped NiOx devices is explained as follows. The SEM and XRD experiments conrm that perovskite layers with larger grains and higher crystallinity can be obtained on the Mn-doped NiOx, as revealed in the 3.2 section. Highquality perovskite absorbers ensure device performance and prevent short-term degradation of devices in the ambient environment. In addition, dark current measurements prove that PSCs based on the Mn-doped NiOx HTL possess a smaller leakage current, especially the 0.5 mol% Mn-doped one. The above results suggest that the Mn-doped NiOx brings better ambient stability of devices compared to the un-doped NiOx. In

previous literature, several elements have been doped into NiOx to serve as the HTL in PSCs. Thiruchelvan et al. demonstrated inverted PSCs using Zn-doped NiOx as the HTL, which maintained 80% of their initial efficiency aer 108 h (4.5 days) in dark environment at room temperature with 40% relative humidity.35 Choi et al. reported Zn-Ce co-doped NiOx HTL for fabricating PSCs. The device retained 60% of initial efficiency aer 120 h (5 days) in ambient environment under 70% relative humidity.36 Bao et al. fabricated PSCs based on Rb-doped NiOx HTL, which aged in the dark at room temperature with 30% relative humidity.61,62 The device retained <70% of initial efficiency aer 700 h (29 days) storage. Compare to other doped elements such as K, La, Li, or Li-Co-Mg co-dopant, a smaller amount of the Mn dopant is needed to achieve comparable device performance, and Mn ions would not damage the perovskite layer as released from NiOx lattice. Moreover, our devices using Mn-doped NiOx as the HTL revealed better stability under more severe test condition.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we selected a simple sol-gel process to prepare Mn-doped NiOx layers for enhancing hole extraction and conductivity of the inorganic NiOx HTL. Mn doping can enhance conductivity and charge transport ability of NiOx to bring on JSC enhancement. Higher transmittance of the Mndoped NiOx HTL in the visible range facilitates incident photons to pass through and to be absorbed by the perovskite layer. The XPS results demonstrate that Mn doping promotes the amount of Ni3+ species and hole transport ability of NiOx. The perovskites on the Mn-doped NiOx have larger grains and higher crystallinity compared with that on the un-doped NiOx, which is benecial for reducing charge recombination. The reduced PL emission and shortened carrier lifetime of the perovskite on the Mn-doped NiOx demonstrates effective charge extraction. Inverted PSCs base on the Mn-doped NiOx with different doping concentration of 0.5-2 mol% as the HTL were fabricated and evaluated for the rst times. The best PSC was achieved using the 0.5 mol% Mn-doped NiOx HTL, revealing the highest PCE of 17.35% and excellent device stability up to 35 days under a continuous halogen lamps matrix exposure in ambient environment.

ABSTRACT Objective To investigate the frequency in which the physician provides a global assessment of disease activity (PhGA) >0and an active joint count (AJC)=0 in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and search for determinants of divergence between the two measures. Methods Data were extracted from a multinational cross-s ectional dataset of 9966 patients who had JIA by International League of Associations for Rheumatology criteria, were recruited between 2011 and 2016, and had both PhGA and AJC recorded by the caring paediatric rheumatologist at the study visit. Determinants of discordance between PhGA>0and AJC=0 were searched for by multivariable logistic regression and dominance analyses. Results The PhGA was scored >0 in 1647 (32.3%) of 5103 patients who had an AJC of 0. Independent associations with discordant assessment were identified for tender or restricted joint count >0, history of enthesitis, presence of active uveitis or systemic features, enthesitis-r춅lated or systemic arthritis, increased acute phase reactants, pain visual analogue scale (VAS)>0, and impaired physical or psychosocial well-b eing. In dominance analysis, tender joint count accounted for 35.43% of PhGA variance, followed by pain VAS>0 (17.72%), restricted joint count >0 (16.14%) and physical health score >0 (11.42%). Conclusion We found that many paediatric rheumatologists did not mark a score of 0 for patients who they found not to have active joints. The presence of pain in joints not meeting the definition of active joint used in JIA was the main determinant of this phenomenon.

Key messages
What is already known about this subject?  The physician global assessment of disease activity
(PhGA) is a key outcome measure of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).  Several studies have shown that many clinicians do not mark the PhGA as 0 for patients who have apparent resolution of active disease.
What does this study add?  This study investigated the frequency of disparity
between a PhGA>0and the absence of active joints and sought for determinants of discordance between the two measures.  The PhGA was scored >0 in a sizeable percentage (32.3%) of 5103 patients who were found to have no active joints.  The presence of joint pain was the main determinant of the divergence between a PhGA>0and an active joint count of 0.
How might this impact on clinical practice or further developments?  This study should prompt the revision of current
criteria for inactive disease in JIA to require the absence of physician-춓eported joint pain related to JIA activity.  The study findings highlight the need for international consensus efforts aimed at developing practical guidance for PhGA scoring in JIA.

INTRODUCTION The physician's global assessment of disease activity (PhGA) is a key outcome measure of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). It consists of the rating of the overall level of child's disease activity on a 10cm or 21-춏umbered circle visual analogue scale (VAS), with

anchors of `0=no activity' and `10=maximum activity'. The PhGA is a complex construct that captures the examiner's subjective appraisal of patient's disease activity at the time of the visit and integrates the information obtained from clinical history with the findings of clinical assessment.
The PhGA has been found to possess strong responsiveness to clinically important

change1 2 and to be a valid and reliable indicator of the overall JIA activity in all stages of the illness.3 Furthermore, it has served as the gold standard against which other newly developed descriptors of the patient's condition or state were compared with establish their criterion (concurrent) and construct validity.4-7 Based on its good measurement properties, the PhGA has been incorporated in the main composite endpoints for JIA, including the core set of variables of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Pediatric 30 response criteria,8 the preliminary criteria for clinical remission in JIA,9 the ACR provisional criteria for defining clinical inactive disease (ID) in JIA,4 and the various versions of the Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS).10-12
The ACR provisional criteria for defining clinical ID in JIA, published in 20114 (thereafter called `2011 ID criteria'), are currently the most popular method to establish the state of complete disease quiescence in JIA. By these criteria, a patient is classified as being in ID when all these conditions are met: (1) absence of active joints; (2) absence of systemic manifestations attributable to JIA; (3) absence of active uveitis; (4) normal acute phase reactants; (5) a PhGA indicating no disease activity (ie, placed at the lowest end of the scale used) and (6) morning stiffness lasting 15min.
By the fifth criterion, the 2011 ID definition requires that the PhGA is marked as 0 on the VAS to enable the classification of the patient's status as ID. However, some investigators have noticed the tendency of some clinicians not to mark their VAS for global assessment at exactly 0, even on resolution of active disease (ie, when all the other ID criteria are met). 7 13 14 This drawback has led to modify the ID criteria in some recent therapeutic studies by setting the minimum score of the PhGA at 115-17 or even at 2.18 Notably, this phenomenon was seen with the use of the 21-춃ircle VAS,19 which is thought to avoid the aversion to extremes often seen on the horizontal line VAS,20 indicating that it does not depend on the type of VAS used.
Thus far, the reasons that explain why the PhGA VAS is not scored as 0 in patients who would otherwise be classified as being in ID by the remaining criteria have seldom been investigated. Because the PhGA is mostly driven by joint symptoms, and the PhGA and the count of active joints are the two main physician-c entred measures included in ID criteria, the analysis of their discordance may be of foremost importance to address the issue. Clarifying this inconsistency is important as the use of ID criteria in the assessment of the effectiveness of the modern therapeutic agents and in the implementation of the treat-t춐-춗arget strategy21 make it essential that the PhGA is scored accurately.
To gain insights from the real world of clinical practice, we evaluated in a large multinational dataset of JIA patients the percentage of instances in which the physician provided a PhGA>0 despite the absence of joints with active arthritis and sought for the determinants of divergence between the two measures.

METHODS Study design and patient selection Data were extracted from three cross-춖ectional datasets of patients meeting the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria for JIA22. The first included 9081 patients recruited between April 2011 and November 2016 in a worldwide survey of the epidemiology, treatment and outcome of JIA (EPOCA study).23 ;the other two datasets were stored at the study center and included 1091 patients.
The characteristics of these patients have been reported elsewhere. 14 23 For the present analysis, we selected 9966 patients for whom both PhGA and active joint count (AJC) recorded at the time of clinical assessment were available.
Outcome measures The PhGA was rated on a 21-춏umbered circle VAS, ranging from 0 (=no activity) to 10 (=maximum activity). The assessment of joint disease was made by the caring physician, who recorded for each of the 73 joints included in the standard articular examination the presence of swelling, tenderness/pain on motion and limited range of motion, as reported.24 A joint was defined as active if it displayed swelling or, in case swelling was absent or not detectable (as in the case of cervical spine or hip), pain/tenderness plus restricted motion. The remaining components of the 2011 ID criteria (active systemic manifestations, active uveitis, elevated acute phase reactants and morning stiffness) were defined as per the original study.4
Based on their topographic location and size, joints were divided into proximal (cervical spine, temporomandibular, shoulder, hip, sacroiliac), distal large (elbow, wrist, knee, tibio-t춁rsal, sub-t춁lar and intertarsal) and distal small (hand metacarpophalangeal and proximal and distal interphalangeal and foot metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal). Articular and extra-a춓ticular damage was assessed through the Juvenile Arthritis Damage Index (JADI).25 Laboratory tests included erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP).
Before the physician assessment, a parent or guardian completed a parent proxy-r춅port version of a multidimensional questionnaire, translated into each national language. The questionnaire includes assessments of the child's physical function, overall well-춂eing, pain, health- related quality of life, morning stiffness, disease status (remission, continued activity or disease flare), and satisfaction with illness outcome.26
The presence of ID was also assessed through the JADAS10, a composite disease activity score that incorporates the following four variables: PhGA, parent assessment of child's well-b eing, AJC, and ESR or CRP. The first two items are scored on a 0-10 scale, the AJC totals the number of active joints up to a number of 10 joints, and the ESR or CRP are transformed from mm/hour or mg/ dL, respectively, to a 0-10 scale; the total score ranges

from 0 to 40. The presence of ID is defined when the JADAS10 score is 1.27
Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were used to summarise patients' characteristics. Bivariate comparisons were performed by means of Mann-W hitney U test for continuous variables and Pearson's 2 test or Fisher test for categorical variables.
To evaluate the effect of candidate variables on the probability of a PhGA>0, a set of binomial generalised linear (logistic) regression models was estimated. Numeric predictors were dichotomised as normal or equal to 0 versus altered or greater than 0. Factors retained in the final models were selected by a backward procedure, based on likelihood ratio testing (p<0.05). The explanatory power of the model was evaluated by McFadden Pseudo-쵷2 (with values between 0.2 and 0.4 indicating excellent model fit)28 and Tiur's R2,29 and by computing the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC-쵷OC) with 10-춆old cross-춚alidation repeated 10 times.
To further explore the relative importance of variables, we employed dominance analysis to rank predictors in terms of their contribution to the overall variance of the outcome, while accounting for their correlations.30 The McFadden R2 statistic was used to calculate general dominance weights. We further obtained bootstrap general dominance values, including estimated bootstrap values of general dominance for each variable and their corresponding SEs using McFadden's measure as a fit index and 1000 permutations.
Multivariable analyses were performed on patients with complete data for all study variables. However, to examine the impact of missing data, we performed a multiple imputation analysis under missing at random assumption by means of chained equations with 50 multiple imputation datasets using the MICE package available in R.

Paediatric rheumatology
All analyses were conducted using the R Statistical language (V.4.0.3; R Core Team, 2020) on Windows 1064 (build 19042) and, for dominance analysis, using the package dominance analysis (V.2.0.0; Claudio Bustos Navarrete and Filipa Coutinho Soares, 2020).
RESULTS Analysis of discordance between PhGA, AJC and other ID criteria Among the 9966 patients with the main outcome data (ie, PhGA and AJC) available, we identified 5103 patients with an AJC of 0. Within this subgroup, the PhGA was scored >0 in 1647 (32.3%) patients. Of these patients, 532 (32.3%) had a score of 0.5, 488 (29.6%) of 1, 141 (8.5%) of 1.5, 189 (11.4%) of 2 and 297 (18.0%) of >2. Among the 7265 patients with complete data available for all study variables, 3491 had an AJC of 0.
We, then, investigated the impact of not meeting each individual item of the 2011 ID criteria in patients who had an AJC of 0 by drawing an UpSet plot, where distinct combinations of items were ranked by frequency (figure 1). In 536 (14.6%) patients, the PhGA was the sole non-m et criterion, which made it the single most frequent reason for not meeting the 2011 ID definition in patients with no active joints. Patients with non-춟ero PhGA scores who met all other ID criteria had a median PhGA value of 1 (IQR 0.5-1.5).
Comparison of clinical features and outcome measures between patients with discordance between PhGA and AJC Table 1 shows the comparison of demographic and clinical features and physician-r춅ported and parent- reported outcomes between patients with no active joints who had the PhGA scored as 0 or >0. Compared with patients with concordant evaluations (ie, with both AJC and PhGA scores as 0), those with divergence between the two assessments (ie, with an AJC=0and a PhGA>0)

had an older age at disease onset, were older and had a longer disease duration at the time of the study visit, and had more frequently rheumatoid factor (RF)-춑ositive polyarthritis and enthesitis-r춅lated arthritis, history of enthesitis, ongoing active systemic features and uveitis, increased acute phase reactants, morning stiffness duration 15min, one or more tender or restricted joints (either overall and in proximal and distal large and small joints), articular damage in at least one site, worse parent-춓eported outcomes, and a lower frequency of ID by the JADAS10. Notably, the latter finding was expected because the PhGA is one of the four components of the JADAS10.
Seventy-춗hree per cent of the patients in the study sample had all outcome data available. The acute phase reactants (ESR and CRP) showed the highest frequency of missing data (21%).
Multivariable analysis of predictors of discordance between PhGA and AJC For the multivariable analysis, complete data were available on 3491 patients. The best-f춊tting model obtained through logistic regression procedures, in which the divergence between AJC and PhGA (ie, PhGA=0and AJC=0 vs PhGA>0and AJC=0) was the dependent variable, is presented in figure 2. Independent associations with a discordant assessment were identified for tender or restricted joint count >0, history of enthesitis, presence of active uveitis or ongoing systemic features, an ILAR category of systemic arthritis, RF-춑ositive polyarthritis and ERA, increased acute phase reactants, pain VAS>0 and impaired quality of live in the physical or psychosocial domains.
The findings yielded by multiple imputation analysis on the incomplete observations (were similar to those observed in the sample with all outcome data available,
Alongi A, et al. RMD Open 2022;8:e002042. doi:10.1136/rmdopen-2021-002042

with the exception of a significant association between RF-춏egative polyarthritis and PhGA (results not shown).
Dominance analysis Next, we performed a dominance analysis to rank the relative contribution of predictive factors in explaining the variance in PhGA. This analysis confirmed that the tender joint count was the main determinant of the discordance between the PhGA and the AJC and accounted for 35.43% of the predicted variance, followed by pain VAS>0 (17.72%), restricted joint count >0 (16.14%), and physical health score >0 (11.42%) (figure 3). The model showed a substantial explanatory power (McFadden R2=0.25, Tjur's R2=0.31), although a sizeable proportion of the variance could not be explained.
Multivariable analysis of predictors of discordance between PhGA and other ID criteria To gain further insights into the reasons that led the caring physician not to provide a score 0 on the PhGA on apparent resolution of active disease, we repeated univariable and multivariable analyses by comparing the 1680 patients who met all 2011 ID criteria, including a PhGA of 0, with the 536 patients who met all 2011 ID criteria, but had the PhGA scored as >0. These analyses revealed that a tender joint count >0 was the factor that led most frequently the physician to provide a score >0, followed by a restricted joint count >0, history of enthesitis, a pain VAS>0, an ILAR category of ERA or systemic arthritis and a physical health score >0 (table 2 and figure 4).
DISCUSSION Our results confirm that many clinicians do not mark the VAS for PhGA at 0 on apparent resolution of active joint disease. In approximately one-t춉ird of our patients who were judged by the caring physician as having no

active joints, the same physician provided a score >0 on the PhGA VAS. Furthermore, the PhGA was the sole non- met 2011 ID criterion in around 15% of these patients and was the single most frequent reason for not meeting the 2011 ID definition. In a sizeable proportion of cases (18%), the PhGA was scored as high as>2. This divergence is a matter of concern and has important implications for the use of the PhGA as an indicator of disease remission in clinical practice and therapeutic trials, especially when the application of the treat-t춐-춗arget strategy is aimed for. Because the study patients were enrolled at 130 paediatric rheumatology centres in 49 countries, our results are likely generalisable to JIA patients seen worldwide and to physicians with varying degrees of training or experience, and practicing in diverse ethnic and cultural environments.
As expected, the lack of fulfilment of other 2011 ID criteria (ie, the presence of active systemic manifestations or uveitis and of increased acute phase reactants) accounted in part for the discordance between a PhGA>0and the absence of active joints. It is noteworthy that in a number of patients the PhGA was scored as 0 in the presence of uveitis or systemic features. However, on multivariable analysis this phenomenon appeared to be explained by several other factors, the chief of which was the presence of joints with isolated tenderness/pain on motion (ie, of joints that displayed pain, but did not meet the definition of active joint used in JIA, which requires that joint pain is accompanied by swelling or limited range of motion). Other determinants included the presence of joints with isolated limited range of motion, a JIA category of systemic arthritis, RF-춑olyarthritis or ERA, a history of enthesitis, a VAS for parent-춓eported pain >0 and a decreased HRQL in the physical domain.
Our findings lead to raise some proposals aimed to increase the concordance between the PhGA and the

other 2011 ID criteria. The marked impact of joint tenderness on the PhGA indicates that the presence of pain is highly valued by the physician in establishing ID. Thus, future revisions of ID criteria for JIA might consider the inclusion of physician-r춅ported active disease related to joint pain.
The incorporation of the absence of parent/patient- reported pain among ID criteria is also worth of consideration, given the marked impact of pain on child's physical function and well-b eing. Guzman et al31 found that most patients, parents and clinicians agreed on the upmost importance of pain and HRQL in describing the course of JIA, and suggested that the inclusion of these parameters could increase the relevance of ID definition for parents and patients. Notably, considerable concern has been raised by the observations of persistent pain in some children with JIA despite adequate treatment with biological medications and good disease control.32-34 Needless to say that in the assessment of parent-춓eported and patient-춓eported pain particular attention should be paid to rule out pain unrelated to disease activity, such as mechanical pain secondary to structural joint damage or pain amplifications symptoms, which are frequent in paediatric rheumatic illnesses, especially in adolescent girl and in patients with long-s춗anding disease.35 However, to patients, remission means no pain, regardless of its cause. Thus, for the treatment of the overall disease across the multidisciplinary team and the understanding of the overall impact of disease, pain amplification and pain secondary to joint damage could be considered in remission criteria. Note that more than 30% of the patients scored by the physician as 0 on PhGA had parents' assessments indicating the presence of active disease and pain (see table 1).
The prominent role of enthesitis and ERA in influencing PhGA suggests that the absence of entheseal

inflammation should be added to the other extra-a rticular criteria in the 2011 ID definition. This modification, which was previously proposed by Shoop-쵽orrall and Hyrich,36 would extend the validity of the criteria to the ERA/spondyloarthritis subset of JIA. Conversely, a history of dactylitis and psoriasis, which are features of juvenile psoriatic arthritis, did not affect the PhGA. However, the meaning of this observation is limited by the small number of patients with these features.
Taylor et al20 found poor agreement among provider raters when scoring patients with JIA who had no clinically apparent disease activity. As in our study, the variable that

influenced the PhGA most strongly in their analysis was joint pain. These investigators emphasised the inherent ambiguity and subjectivity of the PhGA, the implicit inexactitude of attempting to encapsulate a patient's overall condition by the use of any global score, and the challenges in the standardisation of scoring. However, discussion of the cases scenarios narrowed the disagreement, demonstrating that systematic training can improve the measurement characteristics of the PhGA. A wide variability between adult rheumatologists in rating their PhGA of patient with rheumatoid arthritis cases was seen, which led to highlight the need of consensus scores of

physicians' global ratings.37 In the field of inflammatory bowel disease, gastroenterologists have found it necessary to develop guidelines in an attempt to standardise the scoring of the PhGA.38
Our analysis is not without limitations. We could not investigate the relationship between the PhGA and novel biomarkers or imaging methods, especially ultrasound, which may establish disease remission more reliably than clinical assessment. The cross-춖ectional design of the study did not allow us to investigate the relationship between the observed discordance and disease outcomes, such as functional disability and radiographic progression. In addition, the potentially confounding effect of pain determinants external to disease activity, such as mechanical pain, fibromyalgia complaints, mood, anxiety, depression and patient and family coping could not be assessed. We should finally acknowledge that a substantial proportion of the variance in discordance between the PhGA and the NAJ could not be explained and that other items not captured in the study, such as intolerance of medication, could have made some physicians to provide a PhGA score >0.
In conclusion, our study confirms that many clinicians do not mark a score of 0 on the PhGA VAS, even for patients who they find not to have active joints or meet all the other 2011 ID criteria. The presence of joint pain was found to be the main determinant of this phenomenon. However, the observed variability between paediatric rheumatologists in rating the PhGA during periods of inactive disease highlights the need for international consensus efforts aimed at developing practical guidance for its scoring for patients with all categories of JIA.

Making accurate, quantitative predictions of chemical reactivity based on molecular structure is an unsolved problem in chemical synthesis, particularly for complex molecules. We report an approach to reactivity prediction for catalytic reactions based on quantitative structure-reactivity models for a key step common to many catalytic mechanisms. We demonstrate this approach with a mechanistically based model for the oxidative addition of (hetero)aryl electrophiles to palladium(0), which is a key step in myriad catalytic processes. This model links simple molecular descriptors to relative rates of oxidative addition for 79 substrates, including chloride, bromide and triflate leaving groups. Because oxidative addition often controls the rate and/or selectivity of palladium-catalyzed reactions, this model can be used to make quantitative predictions about catalytic reaction outcomes. Demonstrated applications include a multivariate linear model for the initial rate of Sonogashira coupling reactions, and successful site-selectivity predictions for Suzuki, Buchwald-Hartwig, and Stille reactions of multihalogenated substrates relevant to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and natural products.

Introduction
The synthesis of structurally complex organic molecules relies on forging new chemical bonds between diverse molecular building blocks. Catalytic cross-coupling is one of the most versatile and widely-used methods to link these molecular fragments,1 with applications ranging from the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients,2 to the selective modication of biomolecules,3 to the creation of new functional materials.4 While much has been done to develop and understand new cross-coupling reactions and catalysts, less is known about how the specic molecular structures of complex building blocks affect the likelihood of successful coupling.5-7 As a result, time- and resource-intensive reaction screening and optimization campaigns are oen required for each new synthetic target. These involve many iterations and can still result in failure to nd appropriate conditions for a given transformation, impeding access to potentially promising new medicines and materials.

learning25-34 can accelerate the screening/optimization process and increase success rates; however, predictions generated by these approaches are oen limited to the specic reaction under investigation. Developing and rening the next generation of organic chemistry tools, including computer-aided synthesis design, automated reaction optimization, and predictive algorithms,35 requires the development of general and quantitative frameworks that rapidly link molecular structure to reactivity for many different reactants and catalysts.
Here, we describe an approach to predict outcomes for multiple catalytic cross-coupling reactions by focusing on the structure-reactivity relationships for one key mechanistic step (Fig. 1). Specically, we targeted oxidative addition, a fundamental organometallic transformation common to many catalytic reactions.36 Oxidative addition is particularly relevant to palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling, where it is oen the rate and/or selectivity determining step37 (Fig. 1A). We hypothesized that a quantitative structure-reactivity model for the oxidative addition38-40 of aryl electrophiles to a catalytically-relevant Pd(0) complex would enable predictions for palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions under a variety of conditions. We assembled this model by correlating experimental relative rate data (Fig. 1B) with easily-obtained molecular descriptors for a diverse set of substrates, with an emphasis on incorporating pharmaceutically-relevant heterocycles (Fig. 1C).
As hypothesized, the resulting model can be applied to many different cross-coupling reactions. It can predict catalytic rate constants as a function of substrate structure even when different catalysts/solvents are used, can correctly identify the

Importantly from both a fundamental and practical perspective, the predictive ability of this reactivity model extends well beyond the specic molecular structures and reaction conditions included in the initial data set. By revealing how subtle changes to the reacting molecules affect a key step in a catalytic mechanism, this model serves as a powerful predictive tool for cross-coupling, and will enable more sophisticated and accurate computer-aided retrosynthetic design. Finally, this work demonstrates the potential of focusing reaction prediction efforts on fundamental mechanistic steps in catalytic mechanisms.41

Results and discussion
Development of the oxidative addition reactivity model
As the basis for a quantitative structure/reactivity model for cross-coupling catalysis, we conducted a series of oxidative addition competition experiments in THF using a library of 79 (hetero)aryl chlorides, bromides, and triates, reacting with Pd(PCy3)2 (Fig. 1B). Measuring the Pd(II) product ratio by 31P NMR spectroscopy gives relative observed rate constants, and the corresponding relative free energies of activation (DGOA), with 2-bromo-5-nitropyridine set to DGOA  0.
As a check on these kinetic data, we constructed Hammett plots for ve sets of substrates, obtaining reaction constants

consistent with previous reports (Fig. S31-S37). From these data, we have constructed a unied reactivity scale that spans more than 7 orders of magnitude in rate (Fig. 1D), containing substrates with a wide variety of steric and electronic parameters, as well as the three aforementioned leaving groups. We also ruled out the possibility of reversible oxidative addition leading to thermodynamic product ratios by mixing equimolar amounts of six separate pairs of oxidative addition products, all of which retained their 1 : 1 mole ratio even aer extended time (Table S3). Finally, we isolated and characterized six new

representative Pd(II) oxidative addition complexes to conrm their structures as trans-Pd(PCy3)2(Ar)(X) (compounds S1-S6, Fig. S7-S30).
Using the mechanistic features of oxidative addition to Pd(0) as a guide, we considered molecular descriptors that would provide mechanistically meaningful correlations between substrate structures and oxidative addition reactivity (Fig. 2A).39 Mechanisms for aryl halide oxidative addition to Pd(0) have been extensively studied both computationally40,42-44 and experimentally,45-49 and are generally proposed to proceed via

initial coordination of the aromatic p-system to Pd. Two bonding extremes can be envisioned for the p-complex intermediate, where the degree of polarization of the coordinated C]C or C]N bond in the substrate inuences partial charge distribution in the p-complex. From this intermediate, two types of oxidative addition transition state have been proposed: a 3-centered, relatively non-polar transition state involving simultaneous Pd-C and Pd-X bond formation, and a polarized transition state with C-X heterolytic bond cleavage occurring alongside Pd-C bond formation; this latter pathway resembles the proposed mechanism for nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr).46,49 While other coordination modes between the (hetero)aryl substrate and Pd are possible, we restricted our analysis to the p-complex intermediates that would immediately precede oxidative addition.
Based on the structural and electronic features of these transition states, we built our reactivity model for oxidative addition from a combination of average molecular electrostatic potentials (ESP) as electronic descriptors for specic atoms in the substrate,38,50-54 A-values as steric descriptors,55 and the intrinsic bond strength index (IBSI) as a bond energy descriptor (Fig. 2B).56 Importantly, all of these descriptors are directly calculated from electronic wavefunctions (obtained from density functional theory calculations), or are tabulated in the literature. An initial multivariate linear regression analysis27,57 of the descriptor sets for the Ar-Cl and Ar-Br substrates versus relative DGOA (kJ mol1) reveals a strong correlation across the halide substrate library (Fig. 2C).
This model incorporates two ESP values: one for the carbon undergoing substitution (ESP1), and a second for an atom adjacent to the reactive site (ESP2). For 2-halopyridines, ESP2 corresponds to the nitrogen atom. For substrates where the adjacent atoms are inequivalent carbons, which would lead to two possible p-coordination sites prior to oxidative addition, ESP2 is the value that leads to the smaller predicted DGOA (i.e. the faster oxidative addition); either the smaller positive value, or the larger negative value. The model also incorporates two substituent A-values for groups R1 and R2 to account for steric effects on the oxidative addition rate. While the steric effect of groups ortho to the reactive C-X bond is intuitive, the effect of R2 for 2-halopyridine substrates is not initially obvious; however, our experimental results reveal the steric inuence of R2 is approximately equal to that of R1 throughout the 2-halopyridine substrate set. As these two terms have very similar coefficients when treated separately during linear regression (Table S8), we

opted to use the sum (A1 + A2) as a single descriptor. Finally, including the IBSI is necessary to create a model applicable to
both (hetero)aryl chlorides and bromides.
We evaluated the robustness of this linear model by regression analysis of ve random training (60%) and test (40%) sets,
and comparing the mean absolute errors (MAE) and predictive squared correlation coefficients (Q2);58 one example is shown in Fig. 2D (remainder in Fig. S60-S63). All of these analyses give
similar linear equations, and excellent agreement between predicted and experimental values in the test sets. We also evaluated alternative models (Table S9), and partitioned the
data into targeted training and test sets to evaluate out-ofsample prediction accuracy (Fig. S64-S67). The out-of-sample predictions are in excellent agreement with the observed DGOA.
Our initial attempts to incorporate aryl triate electrophiles
into this model using the aforementioned descriptor set were
unsuccessful, leading to poor correlations and inaccurate predictions. We attribute this to C-X bond strength being an insufficient descriptor to differentiate between the reactivity of various leaving groups. Bond strength arguments, oen using
calculated BDEs, are used to rationalize relative oxidative addition reactivity for different substrates, such as for site selectivity in multihalogenated systems.59-61 In our initial model
(Fig. 2C and D), the IBSI term is essentially a step function: there are relatively narrow value distributions within the Ar-Br or Ar- Cl data sets, but a large gap between those data sets that reects the weaker C-Br bond. Plotting a univariate correlation between IBSIC-X and DGOA for all three electrophile classes reveals a similarly tiered structure (Fig. 2E). Strikingly, there is zero correlation between IBSI and DGOA, either within each electrophile class or across the entire data set. Furthermore, the relative ordering of bond strength (C-O > C-Cl > C-Br) is inconsistent with the fact that aryl triates react faster than identically-substituted aryl bromides with Pd(PCy3)2 (kPhOTf/ kPhBr $100). Clearly, bond strength on its own is a poor predictor of oxidative addition reactivity when comparing two substrates with either the same62 or different leaving groups.
To account for additional transition state stabilization by the leaving group itself, which builds up negative charge as the C-X
bond is broken (Fig. 2A), we used a simple descriptor of anion
stability: the pKa of the leaving group's conjugate acid. Adding the pKa values for HOTf, HBr, and HCl (11.3, 4.4, and 0.2 respectively, previously measured in DCE as a non-polar solvent63) results in a unied predictive model (Fig. 2F). Both IBSIC-X and pKa are required as descriptors, with the unied model re-weighting the IBSI term down by a factor of 2. Notably,
the relative contributions of the ESP and A-value terms remain
essentially constant. This model provides, for the rst time, a reliable method to
quantitatively evaluate the relative reactivity of a hypothetical multisubstituted (hetero)aryl triate, bromide, or chloride
toward oxidative addition with a Pd(0) complex without the
need to calculate transition state energies. We again performed cross-validation with a set of ve random 60/40 training/test
data partitions, which give excellent agreement between experimental and predicted values (Fig. S69-S73). Of the 79 substrates, there are only four examples identied as prediction

outliers (standardized residual $2, Table 1). There are no obvious features of these outliers that would point to systematic prediction errors for a particular substructure; there are several similar examples (bromobenzenes, uoropyridines, and pyrimidines) that are predicted accurately.
Finally, to examine the relative contribution of each descriptor to the predicted DGOA of the two models (Fig. 2C and F), we applied a min/max scaling to the descriptor values prior to multivariate regression. The coefficients of the normalized models and their relative contributions are shown in Table 2. In both models, ESP1 is the most consequential descriptor, followed by ESP2 at roughly half the weighting. In contrast, steric effects account for <10% of the predicted DGOA. The C-X bond strength as reported by the IBSI descriptor is also a relatively small contributor (16-20%), consistent with the observation of its poor correlation to DGOA when X remains constant (Fig. 2E). In fact, the pKa of HX is just as consequential for predicting DGOA as the IBSI in the model from Fig. 2F (X  Cl, Br, OTf).
Mechanistic aspects of oxidative addition linked to molecular descriptors.
The predictive power of this reactivity model is a direct result of its mechanistic foundation. ESP1 is related to the electrophilicity of the carbon undergoing oxidative addition, reecting the degree of partial positive charge in the p-complex intermediate and transition state: a larger positive ESP1 leads to a smaller DGOA and thus faster oxidative addition. In contrast, ESP2 reects the degree of negative charge on the adjacent atom (C or N), where a larger negative ESP2 leads to a faster oxidative addition. Considered together, these ESP terms indicate that a more polarized C]C or C]N bond in the substrate leads to faster oxidative addition. It follows from this analysis that the ESP at Pd in the intermediate and/or transition state should also affect the oxidative addition rate, with a larger positive ESPPd correlating with faster oxidative addition. We have conrmed this by determining ESPPd for a set of 11 calculated p-complex intermediates and 6 transition states (Fig. S40-S56). Remarkably, there is a linear correlation between ESPPd for the pcomplexes and DGOA (Fig. 3A and S57), revealing the signicant effect that substrate-catalyst bonding has on the electronic structure, and therefore reactivity, of Pd.
Analyzing how the substrate binds to the catalyst also sheds light on the observed equal weights of the steric A-values for R1 and R2 in affecting DGOA for the 2-halopyridine substrate series. Larger substituents in these positions destabilize the p-complex intermediate and oxidative addition transition state through

steric repulsion between the bound substrate and the ancillary phosphine ligands. Because the Pd center coordinates to the C]N bond, substituents adjacent to either C or N will occupy roughly equivalent positions with respect to the phosphines. Comparing the calculated structures of the p-complex intermediates for 2-chloropyridine to its 3- and 6-triuoromethyl substituted analogues illustrates this feature of the substrate- catalyst interaction (Fig. 3B). Importantly, this mechanistic insight into equal steric effects for R1 and R2 ows directly from our quantitative reactivity model.
Case study #1: predicting reaction rates
To test our hypothesis that the oxidative addition model is applicable to predicting outcomes for cross-coupling catalysis, we applied DGOA predictions in three case studies. The rst test case involves modeling the initial rates of Sonogashira coupling reactions, drawn from published data sets containing 410 individual rates (29 substrates and 17 catalysts, Fig. 4A).64,65 We rst predicted DGOA for each of the 29 aryl bromides in the data sets, using the equation from Fig. 2C (the simpler model when considering only halide-based electrophiles); while 9 of these substrates are included in our experimental oxidative addition data set, the other 20 are out-of-sample predictions.
Remarkably, the predicted DGOA values are linearlycorrelated with the corresponding ln k values for all 17 investigated phosphine ligands (Fig. S74 and S75). Correlations for three of these ligands - P(nBu)3, PCy3, and P(tBu)3 - are shown in Fig. 4B. These correlations hold despite the fact that the Sonogashira reactions are conducted under different conditions

(higher temperature, different solvent) than our oxidative addition experiments, and the fact that our predicted DGOA is derived from a model using only PCy3. We suspect that this aspect of the model's usefulness stems from a consistency in
the relative reactivity of the aryl halide substrates under different conditions, even if the absolute reaction rates differ. Thus, DGOA can be applied to quantitatively predict the outcome of catalytic reactions for out-of-sample substrates, out-of-
sample reaction conditions, and even out-of-sample catalysts. We then expanded the application of DGOA by combining it
with descriptors for the 17 free phosphines to assemble a single and unied linear model to accurately predict ln k for the entire
410 Sonogashira reaction data set. Two descriptors were calculated for the free phosphines - the average ESP at phosphorus, and the percent buried volume (% Vbur) at phosphorus66 - which were combined with DGOA in a multivariate regression analysis.

As shown in Fig. 4C, we obtain excellent linear t and predictive power with initial rates spanning 10 orders of magnitude. These phosphine descriptors outperform the analogous descriptors calculated for the corresponding mono or bis(phosphine) Pd(0) complexes (Fig. S79 and S80). The training and test sets used to build this model are from a random 60/40 split of substrate set #1, which focuses on electronic effects (Fig. 4A).
To challenge the model, we reserved substrate set #2, which focuses on steric effects, as an external validation set. Despite the fact that the Sonogashira rate prediction model training set (substrate set #1, blue and green points in Fig. 4C) contains no substrates with ortho-substituents, and therefore no information about steric effects on reaction rate, the model is still able to predict ln k for substrate set #2 with a mean absolute error of 0.732 (Q2  0.7996). Only two reactions are identied as signicant outliers: 2,4,6-triisopropylphenylbromide with

P(tBu)3 and PAd2(tBu) (the most sterically-hindered substrate with the two largest ligands), which are much slower than the model predicts.
The ability to predict ln k for Sonogashira reactions of an out-of-sample substrate class stems directly from the generality of the predicted DGOA from our oxidative addition reactivity model. The substrate molecular properties - electronics, sterics, and C-X bond strengths - are all encoded within the predicted DGOA values by virtue of the structurally diverse oxidative addition training set. Thus, applying DGOA as a single descriptor takes all of these molecular features into account, enabling accurate catalytic reactivity predictions even if the available training data is not as comprehensive.
Improved prediction accuracy can be achieved by separating the 410-member data set into two subsets based on phosphine ligand size. One set includes reactions using 13 phosphines with a % Vbur <75, and the other includes the 4 largest phosphines (% Vbur >75). For the small phosphine set, a slight reweighting of the three descriptors leads to smaller MAEs for training, test, and external data sets (Fig. 4D). For the large phosphines, we used a 70/30 training/test split due to the smaller number of data points. We also found that a simpler, two-descriptor model is superior for this subset, with only DGOA and %Vbur needed to make accurate predictions (Fig. 4E). This partition into small and large phosphine sets is consistent with prior studies that describe a change in mechanism, where oxidative addition occurs from either bis(phosphine) or mono(phosphine) Pd(0) intermediates.17,33,67 Notably, our predicted DGOA is effective in both cases. This case study not only demonstrates how DGOA can be used to predict how substitution patterns on the electrophile will affect the kinetic behavior of a coupling reaction, but also how DGOA can be used in concert with catalyst-based descriptors to develop models that account for both substrate and catalyst effects on rate.

Case study #2: predicting site selectivity
The second case study tests the use of DGOA in predicting site selectivity for cross-coupling when multiple reactive positions
are present (Fig. 5). Previous approaches to this problem have involved spectroscopic descriptors,68 the distortion-interaction transition state model,62 and qualitative arguments based on empirical observations.37,60 This latter method is most suitable for synthetic planning efforts, but it is largely applied "by analogy" to known systems, and it is not quantitative. Thus,
formulating rapid but accurate predictions for the likely
coupling site of structurally-complex multihalogenated substrates would be greatly benecial for synthetic planning.
Because all of the descriptors in the DGOA prediction model are local rather than global, one can calculate distinct DGOA values for each reactive site in a molecule, with the predicted major site corresponding to the lowest DGOA. Assessing a series of multihalogenated heterocycles with reported experimental selectivities for Suzuki-Miyaura60 and Buchwald-Hartwig69-73 coupling reveals that these DGOA predictions correctly identify the major site of reactivity across a diverse range of
substrates, including many heterocycle classes (isoquinolines,

position in the same molecule, and vice versa. The model is, of
course, not without limitations: predictions for two isothiazole
substrates are not accurate, pointing to C3 as the preferred site
over the correct C5 position.
In addition to identifying the major site of reactivity, the predictions are also quantitative (Fig. 6). A large difference between the DGOA for each site (DDGOA) indicates very high predicted selectivity for one site over another, while a small DDGOA indicates likely poor selectivity. Two specic examples of this are given in Fig. 6A. For Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of methyl 2,6-dichloronicotinate, our model predicts DDGOA  5.4 kJ mol1, favoring C6 by $7 : 1 at 65 C. The observed selectivity using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst at 65 C is 5 : 1 C6 to C3 (DDG  4.5 kJ mol1).74 For 3,6-dichloro-4-methoxypyridazine, our model predicts DDGOA  0.7 kJ mol1, favoring C6 by $1.3 : 1 at 100 C (though this difference is smaller than the
model MAE). The observed selectivity using Pd(PPh 3)4 as a catalyst at 100 C is 3 : 1 C6 to C3, (DDG  3.4 kJ mol1).75 These predictions are also amenable to Buchwald-Hartwig
coupling reactions: the predicted selectivity for 2,4-dichloropyridine is DDGOA  10.0 kJ mol1, favoring C2 by 25 : 1 at 100 C; a set of Buchwald-Hartwig aminations using a Xant-
phos-based catalyst proceed with C2 : C4 selectivity of 20 : 1 to 50 : 1 (DDG  9.3-12.1 kJ mol1 at 100 C).73
Site selectivity is known to be inuenced by reaction conditions, such as catalyst and solvent.37,60,76 Our prediction model is
based on a simple monodentate phosphine using non-polar
reaction solvents, which represents a standard combination
used in synthetic applications. To illustrate how our model
could guide the development of chemo/regiodivergent coupling
reactions, we have applied predictions to substrates known to
have tunable selectivity (Fig. 6B). First, 3,5-dichloropyridazine is predicted to have good selectivity for C3 over C5 (DDGOA  10.6 kJ mol1), consistent with the observed selectivity using
simple ligands (PPh3, dppf); therefore, inverting this selectivity should require extensive catalyst/solvent screening. Researchers
at Merck took this exact approach, discovering that the large QPhos ligand gives high C5 selectivity.77
Second, the predicted DDGOA for 2-chloro-5-bromopyridine is 0.2 kJ mol1, indicating effectively no selectivity; we conrmed this by oxidative addition of this substrate with
Pd(PCy3)2, which gives a 1 : 1 mixture of C2 and C5 products. Thus, our prediction indicates achieving selectivity one way or
the other will require more complex systems. Consistent with
this, two previous studies reveal ligand-controlled reactivity at
either C2 or C5, with high C2 selectivity requiring extensive
screening and catalyst parameterization, and use of an unconventional diaminophosphine (dmapf).69,78
Finally, we predict that 2,4-dibromopyridine should be selective for C2 (DDGOA  8.0 kJ mol1, C2 : C4 $25 : 1 at 25 C), which is exactly what is observed experimentally using homogeneous Pd catalysis.79 A recent report revealed that heteroge-
neous, nanoparticle-based Pd catalysis is capable of inverting the selectivity to $1 : 7 C2 : C4.80 As for the examples above,
overriding the predicted selectivity requires a dramatically different catalyst system.

Case study #3: retrospective synthesis planning
As a nal case study, we have retrospectively applied DGOA predictions to two reported synthesis toward dragmacidin D (Fig. 7).81-83 The general sequence relies on two regioselective cross-coupling reactions to a dihalogenated pyrazine core (Fig. 7A). Among the key design questions are how to achieve selective, sequential couplings, and how to ensure compatibility with the existing Ar-Br in indole 1 (which is present in the natural product).83
Two approaches to this problem have been reported. En route to the rst completed synthesis of dragmacidin D, Garg, Sarpong, and Stoltz (Fig. 7B)81 conducted model studies using 2iodo-5-chloro-3-methoxypyrazine to maximize site-selectivity, though they observed that the nature of the protecting group on the indole also has a signicant effect on reactivity. With an N-Ts protecting group, bis(arylation) is readily achieved at elevated temperature, whereas with N-TIPS, the intermediate pyrazine is deactivated, preventing a second coupling. The remote electronic effect of the N-Ts group, which activates the C5 pyrazine position, is described as a fortuitous discovery.

Applying our DGOA predictions to these intermediates clearly reveals not only the existence but the magnitude of this effect, leading to $5-fold higher predicted reactivity between N-Ts and
N-TIPS substrates. Thus, a subtle but important reactivity difference could be anticipated based on predicted DGOA prior to experimental work, and help guide protecting group
selection.
The second coupling required a switch to the 2-iodo-5-
bromo-3-methoxypyrazine to maximize site-selectivity, which again could be predicted based on our model. The DDGOA for the two Ar-Br positions in the pyrazine-indole intermediate used in the synthesis is 23.2 kJ mol1, consistent with the
observed high selectivity. Hypothetical use of the corresponding 5-chloropyrazine intermediate gives a predicted DDGOA of <5 kJ mol1 ($6 : 1 at 50 C), which while still selective for the
desired position, would likely lead to overreaction and yield
loss. Again, this type of prediction could help to guide synthetic
design and subsequent experimental investigations. Yang, Liu, and Jiang reported a similar approach (Fig. 7C)82
that employed 2,5-dibromo-3-methoxypyrazine as the pyrazine
building block; a series of model studies established that

regioselective C2-coupling is possible. Despite the fact that both
sites appear very similar, our model predicts that C2 is the major site, albeit with moderate selectivity (DDGOA  5.1 kJ mol1, 6 : 1 at 80 C); this lower selectivity may be reected in the lower isolated yield relative to the differential
halogenation strategy of Garg et al. In the subsequent Stille
coupling, Yang et al. use the unprotected indole derivative, which we predict is $10-fold less reactive than the corre-
sponding N-Ts substrate; nevertheless, the desired reaction site is heavily favored relative to the other two Ar-Br positions,
consistent with the observed regioselectivity.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated that a quantitative structure-reactivity model for oxidative addition, a key step in many catalytic mechanisms, enables accurate predictions for the outcome of various cross-coupling reactions. By correlating relative reaction rates with easily-obtained molecular descriptors, we can predict the reactivity of diverse (hetero)aryl electrophiles toward oxidative addition to Pd(0). This reactivity model links molecular structure to predicted DGOA for any hypothetical substrate, with applicability well beyond the oxidative addition training set. We used these DGOA values to predict rates and selectivities for many different catalytic reactions under various conditions, including Sonogashira, Suzuki, Buchwald-Hartwig, and Stille couplings.
Given the importance of palladium-catalyzed reactions in the synthesis of complex organic molecules, we anticipate that quantitative reactivity predictions could be used during synthetic planning to design substrates with high intrinsic selectivity, and/or to identify where achieving the desired selectivity is likely to be more challenging/resource intensive. Applying DGOA predictions to hypothetical synthetic sequences and potential intermediates could therefore be used to design more selective routes and/or prioritize different potential routes prior to commencing experimental investigations. It could also be used to identify where extensive reaction development is necessary (e.g. overriding predicted selectivity), or where "simple" systems are likely to be successful. As we expand this oxidative addition reactivity model to incorporate additional sets of reaction conditions and catalysts, we expect it will not only shed new light on the mechanistic aspects of crosscoupling, but also nd widespread use in rening and augmenting computer-aided synthesis design and automated reaction discovery/optimization. Finally, we are exploring quantitative reactivity models based on key steps in other catalytic mechanisms to generate accurate and general predictions across the synthesis landscape.

ABSTRACT
Background. In Latin America, the prevalence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) has risen tremendously during the last decade. Previous studies have suggested that receiving dialysis at high altitude confers mortality benefits; however, this effect has not been demonstrated at >2000 m above sea level (masl) or in developing countries. Methods. This historical cohort study analyzed medical records from six Peruvian hemodialysis (HD) centers located at altitudes ranging from 44 to 3827 masl. Adult ESKD patients who started maintenance HD between 2000 and 2010 were included. Patients were classified into two strata based on the elevation above sea level of their city of residence: low altitude (<2000 masl) and high altitude (2000 masl). Death from any cause was collected from national registries and Cox proportional hazards models were built. Results. A total of 720 patients were enrolled and 163 (22.6%) resided at high altitude. The low-altitude group was significantly younger, more likely to have diabetes or glomerulonephritis as the cause of ESKD and higher hemoglobin. The all-cause mortality rate was 84.3 per 1000 person-years. In the unadjusted Cox model, no mortality difference was found between the high- and low-altitude groups fhazard ratio [HR] 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89-1.62]g. After multivariable adjustment, receiving HD at high altitude was not significantly associated with higher mortality, but those with diabetes as the cause of ESKD had significantly higher mortality [HR 2.50 (95% CI 1.36-4.59)]. Conclusions. In Peru, patients receiving HD at high altitudes do not have mortality benefits.

Altitude affects mortality in Peruvian HD patients | 999

INTRODUCTION
Chronic noncommunicable diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), are the leading cause of death in developed countries and impose an enormous cost on countries of Latin America (LA) [1-3]. Data on the CKD burden in LA are scarce; however, some studies have found CKD prevalence to be as high as 8% in Mexico [4], 12% in Chile [5] and 16.8% in Peru [6]. Similarly, the prevalence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients under renal replacement therapies (RRTs) in LA has substantially increased from 119 patients per million people (pmp) in 1991 to 669 patients pmp in 2013 [7, 8].
In Peru, access to RRTs is not universal, mostly benefiting those with social security (EsSalud) and some with subsidized insurance from the Ministry of Health [6]. In 2010, EsSalud provided RRTs to 9814 patients and the Ministry of Health provided RRTs to 1983 patients in 2014 [9]. These numbers reflect the high prevalence of ESKD requiring RRT in this country, which is similar to developed regions worldwide. Furthermore, they suppose an increasing unmet need that affects a large number of Peruvians.
Peru has 30 million inhabitants and a third of its population lives at altitudes >2000 m. Prior studies have shown that patients who receive dialysis at an altitude >1828 m above sea level (masl) have 15% lower mortality risk in a 5-year follow-up compared with similar patients who receive dialysis at sea level [10]. However, this study was carried out in the USA, with 0.4% of their sample living at >1828 masl and where the highest hemodialysis (HD) center is located at 2299 masl [11]. Thus, little is known about mortality in patients with ESKD living at higher altitudes, especially >2000 masl, where arterial oxygenation saturation starts to decline [12]. Therefore this study was conducted to determine the effect of altitude on mortality in ESKD patients receiving HD in Peru.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This historical cohort study included patients with ESKD from six HD centers located at different altitudes: Centro Nacional de Salud Renal, EsSalud-Lima, Hospital Nivel IV Victor Lazarte Echegaray, EsSalud-Trujillo (at sea level); Hospital Nivel II Huanuco, EsSalud-Huanuco (at 1894 masl); Hospital Nivel IV Carlos Alberto Seguin Escobedo, EsSalud-Arequipa (at 2335 masl); Hospital Nivel IV Adolfo Guevara Velasco, EsSalud-Cusco (at 3400 masl) and Hospital Nivel III Puno, EsSalud-Puno (at 3827 masl).
All patients who initiated maintenance HD between 2000 and 2010 in these locations and who were >18 years of age were included. Patients who died within 90 days of HD initiation or those who previously received renal transplant or peritoneal dialysis were excluded. The study was approved by the ethics committees from Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia and EsSalud. All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the ethics committees at EsSalud and Cayetano Heredia and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study.
Using a standardized form, medical records were reviewed to gather the following information: age, sex, cause of ESKD, date of the first HD session and date of the last follow-up. Death from any cause was the outcome of interest and it was collected from national registries.

Patients were classified into two strata based on the elevation above sea level of their city of residence: low altitude (<2000 masl) and high altitude (2000 masl). A sensitivity analysis using a lower altitude cutoff (1828 masl) was performed. Medians and frequencies of patient characteristics were calculated by elevation group. Pearson chi-squared and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for univariate analyses of baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the time from first HD to death from any cause, stratifying for each year and following patients for up to 5 years after first dialysis. Observations were censored by the end of the data collection (January 1, 2012) and censure criteria were applied as following: loss to follow-up, survival after 5 years of first HD, transference to another HD center outside the city, renal transplantation or migration to peritoneal dialysis during follow-up. Patients living at low altitude served as a reference category for all analyses.
Cox proportional hazards models were employed to look at the unadjusted and adjusted associations with mortality; the latter included altitude, age, sex and cause of ESKD as well as interactions of cause of ESKD with altitude. A subgroup analysis looked at the association between hemoglobin and mortality. Pvalues <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were carried out using SAS/STAT software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) on a Windows 7 platform.
RESULTS
Of 2576 patients who started HD between 2000 and 2010 at the six HD centers, 720 (39.6%) met inclusion criteria (Figure 1). In Trujillo, Lima and Huanuco, 77.4, 81.8 and 84.5% of incident HD patients were enrolled, respectively; whereas in Puno, Cusco and Arequipa, these proportions fell to 34.7, 33.3 and 4.8%, respectively (Figure 2). A total of 557 (77.4%) patients were in the low-altitude group (72 from Trujillo, 436 from Lima and 49 from Huanuco) and 163 (22.6%) were in the high-altitude group (37 from Arequipa, 116 from Cusco and 10 from Puno). Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1, stratified by elevation group. Patients in the low-altitude group were significantly younger, more likely to have diabetes or glomerulonephritis as the cause of ESKD and had higher hemoglobin.
Over a median follow-up of 3.6 years, there were 260 (36.1%) deaths (overall mortality rate 84.3 per 1000 person-years). In the low-altitude group, 207 (37.2%) patients died, while in the highaltitude group, 53 (32.5%) died. In an unadjusted Cox proportional hazards model, the high-altitude group had a trend toward higher mortality, although it was not statistically significant fhazard ratio [HR] 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89-1.62], P  0.243g (Figure 3). In the sensitivity analysis using a lower altitude cutoff of 1828 masl, the high-altitude group had significantly higher mortality [HR 1.42 (95% CI 1.07-1.90), P  0.016] (Supplementary data). In the univariate subgroup analysis, increased hemoglobin was not significantly associated with lower mortality [HR 0.95 (95% CI 0.87-1.04), P  0.274].
An adjusted Cox model (Table 2) with altitude, age, sex and cause of ESKD was fit and demonstrated that the high-altitude group had higher mortality, but this association did not reach statistical significance [HR 1.16 (95% CI 0.85-1.58), P  0.360]. Similarly, women had a nonsignificant trend toward higher mortality [HR 1.30 (95% CI 1.00-1.69), P  0.050]. Additionally, for each year of increase in age, the hazard of death increased by 4% [HR 1.04 (95% CI 1.03-1.05), P < 0.001] over both altitudes. A second adjusted Cox model (Table 3) with altitude, age, sex and interaction of cause of ESKD and altitude level was fit and

showed that patients with diabetes as the cause of ESKD in the high-altitude group experience significantly higher mortality [HR 2.50 (95% CI 1.36-4.59), P  0.003]. There is also a suggestion that this is true for hypertension as cause of ESKD.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study, to our knowledge, that has examined the association between altitude and mortality in patients receiving HD in the Andes. This is important not only due to the altitude levels seen in these cities, but also because this is an ethnic group that is very different from others living at high altitude. In fact, Andeans have lived at high altitude for >11 000 years, developing circulatory, respiratory and hematological adaptations; however, when compared with Tibetan populations, the former have higher hemoglobin concentrations, lower resting ventilation, higher oxygen saturation and an absence of genetic adaptation [13, 14].

Our sample was composed of middle-aged subjects, a population relatively younger than that of other studies involving maintenance HD [10]. Interestingly, those who started HD at high altitude were significantly older than their low-altitude counterparts. This is in agreement with prior evidence showing that slower CKD progression may be present at high altitude [15, 16]. However, other factors such as lower survival in older patients living at low altitude due to significant comorbidities or increased availability of healthcare resources with planned HD initiation in these settings need to be considered.
Substantial mortality rates were found across both altitude groups and a nonsignificant trend toward higher mortality was observed in those living at high altitude in the adjusted analysis. Our results differ from prior findings [10, 17, 18] that showed up to 18% mortality reduction in dialysis patients receiving HD at increased altitudes. Notably, these studies were conducted mainly in Caucasian populations at altitudes not significantly >2000 masl. Our results could potentially be explained by a

myriad of factors, including not only the magnitude of altitude level, but also genetic and adaptation variances from our specific patient population, comorbid conditions, healthcareassociated factors and social disparities. Erythropoietin use may also differ in different Peruvian centers, as noted by lower hemoglobin levels in the high-altitude group, which may make

them prone to the deleterious effects of anemia in an already hypoxic environment.
Additionally, our study raises concern for a potential sex disparity in Peruvian patients receiving HD across altitude levels, since women had a nonsignificant increase in the hazard of death of 30%. A similar observation has been documented in Caucasian and Asian populations receiving HD and potential reasons include longer waiting times to HD initiation, greater loss of residual renal function, lower urea clearance adjusted for urea volume (Kt/Vurea) and shorter HD sessions [19].
Moreover, we found higher mortality among those subjects with diabetes receiving HD at high altitude. Regarding the previously described independent association between higher altitude, worsening hypoxemia and increased cardiometabolic risk factors [20], it is possible that this higher mortality may be strongly influenced by cardiovascular disease. Future studies are needed to explore this association, accounting for potential confounders.
Our study was performed in patients who had social security to ensure access to healthcare and guideline uniformity. However, we could not account for specific differences in the way healthcare is delivered in each center, their staffing needs or medication availability. Furthermore, Andeans' lifestyle and stress levels may be different than their coastal peers, impacting mortality outcomes. Indirect data that support the existence of regional differences include the gross domestic product per capita [in Lima, Arequipa and Trujillo (US$1631-3073) is higher than in Cusco, Puno and Huanuco (US$681-1228)] [21], life expectancy [in Lima, Arequipa and Trujillo (74.1-78.4 years) is higher than in Huanuco, Puno and Cusco (64.3-68.5 years)] [22], human development index (higher in Lima and Arequipa; intermediate in Trujillo; and lower in Huanuco, Cusco and Puno) [23], number of university hospitals offering nephrology training (nine in Lima, two in Arequipa, one in Cusco and none in Trujillo, Huanuco or Puno) [24] and the proportion of Quechua ethnicity [higher in Cusco, Puno and Huanuco (43.1-74.7%) than in Arequipa, Lima and Trujillo (2.9-31.3%)] [25].
This study has several limitations. Our high-altitude group size was comparatively small and clustering of altitude levels was performed. The percentage of incident HD patients that were enrolled in Arequipa was <10%, mostly due to missing

charts (71%), while in Cusco this proportion was <35% due to the high incidence of acute kidney injury (26%). The differences observed in our results could be due to uncontrolled patient characteristics or environmental factors correlated with altitude rather than an independent effect of altitude. Moreover, comorbid conditions, medication use (including erythropoietin analogs), nutritional status, dialysis efficiency (Kt/V) and residual renal function were variably reported in paper charts and many times missing, therefore mortality could not be adjusted for them in the Cox proportional models.
In conclusion, Peruvian patients receiving HD at high altitudes do not have mortality benefits.

Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) commonly occurs among individuals at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis. Extant research has yet to examine the prevalence and clinical/functional correlates of SAD in this population compared to a community control (CC) sample. This comparison may improve the generalizability that traditional nonpsychiatric control samples cannot provide. Additionally, it remains unknown how SAD contributes to symptom severity and social impairments in individuals at CHR for psychosis. Methods: Both CHR and CC groups were recruited from general community sources; CC participants were not excluded in this analysis on the basis of any psychopathology except psychosis. A total of 245 adolescents and young adults (CHR = 81; CC = 164) were administered the Social Phobia Scale, the Structured Interview for Psychosis-risk Syndromes, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Research Version, and the Social Functioning Scale. Results: The CHR group was at increased risk for having SAD relative to CC (42% CHR; 13% CC; RR = 3.28) and, to a lesser degree, a nonSAD anxiety disorder (41% CHR; 29% CC; RR = 1.42). Greater social anxiety was related to higher levels of negative (r = 0.29) but not positive (r = 0.05) symptoms within the CHR group. Furthermore, elevated social anxiety was found to be linked with poor social functioning in the CHR group (r = -0.31). Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the specificity of SAD over and above other anxiety disorders in individuals at CHR for psychosis and the critical target of SAD to treat subclinical psychotic symptoms and social functioning.

Introduction
Anxiety disorders are among the most common comorbid diagnoses in individuals with psychotic disorders.1,2 Among anxiety-related disorders, social anxiety, specifically, is highly prevalent among individuals with psychosis2-5 and is reflected in aspects of both positive (eg, paranoia, persecutory ideation) and negative (eg, anhedonia, alogia, and blunted expression of emotion) psychotic symptoms.6 In psychosis, social anxiety has important contributions to reduced quality of life,4 social function,4,7,8 and self-esteem.9 Social anxiety may also contribute to impairments in social support and quality of social relationships associated with worsening course and recurrence of psychotic episodes.10 This relationship to the clinical course may be particularly important for those at clinical-high risk for psychosis (CHR), who also experience elevated levels of anxiety disorders that lead them to seek treatment.11 Additionally, social anxiety may relate to the risk for psychosis (attenuated psychosis symptoms) and social functioning in CHR individuals. The prevalence and clinical impact of social anxiety may have implications for first psychosis onset, functional outcomes, and treatment targets.12
The potential influence of anxiety disorders can often be overlooked in clinical research, despite estimates of anxiety disorders in CHR individuals being high

(14%-53%).13-18 However, extant research does not provide a clear comparison of prevalence rates between CHR individuals and their community peers. Instead, most extant literature compares CHR samples to non-helpseeking controls who do not endorse major psychiatric illness.16,19 By nature, this approach selects a comparison group that does not necessarily represent the general population. The few studies that have compared the rates of anxiety in help-seeking CHR individuals16,18 found social anxiety to be the most prevalent. As a result, questions remain regarding the generalizability and specificity of inferences that can be made about the comorbidity of social anxiety with CHR for psychosis.20 Nonpsychiatric samples inflate the effect of the independent variables, complicating the interpretation of study findings.21 Extant studies focused on the prevalence of social anxiety disorder (SAD) may overestimate the magnitude of the difference between groups.
The few studies that have examined the relationship between social anxiety and attenuated psychotic symptoms in CHR individuals16,18 have found conflicting results, similar to studies examining this relationship in psychosis.9,22,23 One study demonstrated a unique relationship between social anxiety and positive symptoms in CHR individuals16; the other found that social anxiety symptoms were related to both positive symptoms and negative symptoms.18 Thus, social anxiety appears related to symptom severity, but the specificity of that relationship to positive or negative symptom domains remains unclear. As a result, questions remain regarding how comorbid social anxiety may relate to symptom severity and course in those at CHR for psychosis.
Further, addressing social anxiety may attenuate social dysfunction in CHR individuals and potentially reduce the risk for worsening course.10,24 Despite a paucity of research investigating social anxiety in the psychosisrisk syndrome, a number of studies have identified the critical role of social functioning and social support in the clinical course in individuals at CHR for psychosis. People at CHR for psychosis exhibit impairments in social functioning,25 deficits in the number, and quality of close relationships, which leads to lower quality of life.26 Early impaired social functioning and quality of life in CHR individuals appears to be a core feature of risk for psychosis,24,26-31 and may be related to the presence of comorbid anxiety disorders.32,33 Yet, the particular role of social anxiety to these interpersonal functioning deficits is unknown, though social anxiety may contribute to a reduced social function.
The current study examined the prevalence of social anxiety and other anxiety disorders in a community sample of CHR young adults and community control (CC) sample. This CC comparison group includes individuals with a range of psychopathology. We hypothesized that the CHR group would be at greater risk for having a SAD diagnosis and elevated social anxiety
Page 2 of 8

symptoms compared to the CC group. We predicted that CHR status would be specifically related to social anxiety and not reflect a general increased risk for anxiety disorders. Next, in an effort to better understand how social anxiety is related to other core components of the CHR syndrome, the current study examined the relationship of social anxiety symptom severity to positive and negative symptom domains in the CHR group. Based on conflicting conclusions of previous studies,16,18 our analysis was exploratory. Finally, the current study examined the association between social anxiety and social functioning, specifically within a sample of CHR young adults, which may have clinical implications for the targeted treatment of social anxiety to improve functional impairments. We predicted that increased social anxiety symptoms among the CHR group would relate to decreased social functioning.
Methods
Participants
Participants included adolescents and young adults who were recruited as part of the ongoing Multisite Assessment of Psychosis-Risk34 (MAP; 2017-2020 for current analytic sample) study. The MAP study is a large investigation of early identification and evaluation of psychosis-risk within the community. Participants were recruited through various outlets, including Craigslist posts, online ads (eg, through Facebook), online student volunteer pools, a refer-a-friend link, and hanging flyers in public locations across the catchment areas: the greater Philadelphia, Chicago, and Baltimore areas. In concordance with the study goals of assessing psychosis risk in a nontreatment seeking, community comparison group, clinical locations such as outpatient clinics and hospitals were not targeted for recruitment. Inclusion criteria for the MAP study also required that all participants were proficient in English, ages 16-30, and had a normal or corrected vision. Although the presence of a past or current psychotic diagnosis (n = 3; assessed at in-person visit) was not an exclusion criterion, those with psychotic diagnoses were excluded from the current analyses.
Participant selection contained two phases: first, participants (n = 3460) completed an online survey that included a battery of questionnaires, among which were two self-report scales of psychosis-risk: the Prodromal Questionnaire35 (PQ; psychosis-risk threshold = reporting  8 distressing items on the positive symptom subscale) and the PRIME Screen36 (psychosis-risk threshold = endorsing reporting two ratings of 5s or one rating of 6). Second, eligibility to participate in Phase 2 was determined by being either above the predetermined psychosis-risk threshold (Questionnaire High Risk; n = 651) or randomly selected from participants below the threshold (Questionnaire Low Risk; n = 656). There were no other exclusion criteria. Finally, eligible participants

Social Anxiety and Psychosis-Risk

were invited for in-person clinical interviews. At the time of the current analysis, 539 participants had completed interviewers or were in progress. The analytic dataset included 245 participants that had data available for variables of interest (eg, Social Functioning Scale [SFS], Social Phobia Scale [SPS], Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes [SIPS] positive and negative scores, complete Structured Clinical Interview for DSM5). All raters were advanced research assistants, doctoral students in clinical psychology, and postdoctoral fellows. To ensure accurate and consistent diagnoses across the study sites the following procedures were followed: (1) all clinical interviewers were SIPS certified at an official SIPS training, (2) diagnostic consensus phone meetings (with one senior rater from each site) were held to review interviews with clinical symptoms, and (3) if there were disagreements in consensus calls, cases were triaged to the PI meeting and the 3 PIs resolved disagreements (majority rule).34
Clinical Measures
During the MAP study Phase 1, the SPS37 and the SFS38 were administered online. The SPS is a 20-item self-report measure with questions pertaining to anxiety related to scrutiny and being observed by others. Each item is rated on how accurately the question characterizes the respondent on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The SPS is a reliable and valid measure of social anxiety symptoms.39 The SFS is a 79-item self-report measure designed to assess social functioning in schizophrenia. Items rate ability and performance related to social engagement, interpersonal contact, recreation, independence and competence in activities, and activities of daily living and employment.38 The SFS is a well-established measure within psychosis literature, demonstrates strong internal reliability and consistency, and is a sensitive measure of social functioning.38 The SFS is a measure designed for adults, and as such, the MAP study modified it to reflect impairments of the target adolescent/young adult demographic. Modifications consisted of excluding subscales assessing ability and performance of skills necessary for independent living (independence-competence and independence-performance subscales). Additionally, the occupation/employment subscale of the SFS may not be an appropriate scale for most high school or collegeage samples and was adjusted to fit the adolescent/young adult sample. Subsequently, the scoring of this occupation/employment subscale was adapted to account for these changes. A higher total SFS score indicates better social functioning.
Phase 2 of the MAP study consisted of in-person interviews. Among these interviews, the SIPS40 and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5, Research Version41 (SCID-5-RV) were used. The current study focused on the CHR group consisted of individuals meeting

SIPS criteria for attenuated positive symptoms syndrome (APSS). This inclusion criteria included those identified as APSS persistent (CHR persistent; n = 44; symptom severity and frequency have remained stable over the past 12 months) or APSS progressive (CHR progressive; n = 37; attenuated symptoms have begun or worsened in severity and frequency within the past year). A chisquare analysis determined that there was no significant difference in the prevalence of SAD diagnosis between these subgroups, 2 = 1.8, p = 0.18, and the categorical analyses in this study combined these subgroups into one single CHR group. The SIPS rates positive symptom severity on a 7-point Likert-type scale rated absent (0) to psychotic (6). For the current study, sum scores were used to quantify positive and negative symptoms. Participants at Phase 2 that did not meet the criteria for a CHR syndrome were considered part of the CC group (n = 164). The SCID-5-RV is a semi-structured interview used to assess the presence of major DSM-5 mental diagnoses.41 The SCID-5-RV has demonstrated moderate-to-strong reliability and is currently considered the "gold standard" of clinical diagnostic assessment. The study used the SCID-5-RV to assess the presence of a current diagnosis of SAD.
Statistical Approach
All analyses were estimated using R version 3.6.1.42 Independent samples t-tests and chi-square tests of independence were used to examine differences in age and gender between experimental groups. Chi-square tests were used to examine group differences in the prevalence of SAD diagnosis, other anxiety disorder diagnoses, and no anxiety-related diagnosis. Individuals with a SAD diagnosis only, as well as individuals with a SAD diagnosis and comorbid disorders, were included in the "SAD category." The "other anxiety-related disorder" category included multiple anxiety-related diagnoses (ie, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, agoraphobia, and panic disorder). The low frequency of each of these anxiety disorders warranted combining them into one group to most conservatively estimate the difference between other anxiety-related disorders and social anxiety in CHR and CC groups. Consistent with the rationale for a community sample comparison group, the "no anxiety-related diagnosis" category is not an artificially "clean" category, but rather identifies those who do not have any DSM-5 anxiety disorder, though these individuals may still have another non-anxiety diagnosis (see Supplemental table 1). A follow-up examination of the standardized residuals (ie, normalized residuals of the observed and expected frequencies in the omnibus chi-square test) was conducted to identify cells that significantly contributed to the chisquare value. In the current study, a large standardized residual (2) indicated that more or less participants than expected by chance were part of a cell, and thus,
Page 3 of 8

F. S. Kuhney et al

significantly contributed to the omnibus chi-square result.43 Additionally, follow-up relative risk ratios44,45 were calculated46 (epiR). Relative risk ratios provide estimates of the likelihood of an outcome (SAD, other anxietyrelated disorder, and no anxiety-related disorder) for an exposed group (CHR) relative to the likelihood of the outcome in the control group44,45(CC). Separate linear regression models42 were employed in two separate analyses to investigate the relationship between social anxiety symptom levels and positive and negative symptoms (lm base function). Next, to examine the relationship between social anxiety symptom severity and social functioning within the CHR group, linear models were used to examine the association between SAD symptom level and social functioning. Continuous social anxiety symptom severity was used in this analysis. Relatedly, the categorical diagnosis was also examined in relation to positive and negative symptoms and social functioning. In evaluating the pattern of missing data, the finalfit47 R packages were used. There were minimal missing data for the variables of interest (SAD diagnosis n = 0; SPS total n = 9; SIPS positive symptoms total n = 1; SIPS negative symptoms total n = 19, SFS total n = 14). Missing data were assessed for bias but were found to be missing completely at random, following no trends by group, sex, or age, as assessed by missing_pairs and missing_compare R functions.
Results
Demographics of the CHR and CC Samples
There were no significant differences between CHR (n = 81) and CC (n = 164) groups for gender, 2(1) = 0.44, p = 0.50, age, t(137.51) = 1.52, p = 0.13, race, 2(5) = 5.19, p = 0.39, or household income, 2(17) = 19.76, p = 0.29. See table 1 for demographic information and Supplemental table 2 for household income, years of education completed, and current role information. Within the CHR group, there was no significant difference in age, t(137.51) = 1.52, p = 0.13, nor gender, 2 = 0.44, p = 0.50, between CHR persistent and CHR progressive subgroups.
Group Differences in the Prevalence of Social Anxiety and Other Anxiety Diagnoses. The prevalence of SAD diagnosis, other anxiety-related diagnoses, and no anxietyrelated diagnoses was compared across CHR and CC groups using a 3  2 chi-square analysis. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of SAD, other anxietyrelated diagnoses, and no anxiety-related diagnoses between CHR and CC groups, 2(2) = 43.52, p < 0.001 (figure 1). Follow-up examination of the standardized residuals from the omnibus chi-square showed that significantly fewer participants in the CHR group than expected by chance had no anxiety-related diagnosis

risk ratios demonstrated that the CHR group, relative to CC, had an increased risk of having SAD by approximately 3-fold (RR = 3.30, 95% CI: 2.04-5.27, OR = 4.93). Additionally, the risk of having no anxiety-related diagnosis was 0.30 times less in the CHR group relative to CC (RR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.18-0.48, OR = 0.15). Furthermore, the CHR group had approximately 1.4 times greater risk compared to the CC group (RR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.00- 2.03, OR = 1.71) of having another, non-SAD anxiety disorder. Supplemental table 1 provides the frequency of other anxiety-related disorders and no-anxiety-related diagnostic groups across CHR and CC groups. The increased risk of SAD in the CHR group, which was even greater than the relative risk of having another anxietyrelated diagnosis, further supports subsequent analyses solely examining SAD's relationship to subclinical psychotic symptoms and social function. Chi-square analyses were also conducted excluding individuals with comorbid diagnoses and including these individuals as their own group, and both demonstrated significant differences in base rates across CHR and CC groups (see Supplemental Materials [SM]).
Group Differences in Levels of Social Anxiety Symptoms. Social anxiety symptoms were compared across CHR and CC groups in an independent sample t-test. CHR and CC groups differed in self-reported social anxiety, such that the CHR group exhibited increased symptoms of social anxiety (M = 31.70, SEM = 2.07) compared to the CC group (M = 20.50, SEM = 1.30), t(234) = 4.71, p < 0.001, d = 0.63.
Relationship Between Social Anxiety to Positive and Negative Symptom Severity
Two separate linear regression analyses examined the relationship of social anxiety symptoms to positive and negative symptoms in the CHR group, figure 2. Greater negative symptoms (total negative symptoms score) were related to greater social anxiety symptoms (total SPS score) among CHR participants, b = 1.05, t(57) = 2.28, r = 0.29, r2 =0.07, p = 0.03. Total positive symptoms score was not significantly related to the total SPS score, b = 0.28, t(74) = 0.43, r = 0.05, r2 = -0.01, p = 0.67, among the CHR group. Supplemental analyses examined this question with categorical diagnoses, and individuals who met DSM criteria for comorbid SAD had greater positive, but not negative, symptoms compared to those who did not (SM).
Functional Outcomes of Social Anxiety
To investigate the relationship between social anxiety and social functioning in the CHR group, linear modeling was employed. Social anxiety symptoms were negatively correlated with social functioning,

b = -0.25, t(69) = -2.71, r =-0.31, r2 = 0.08, p = 0.008, demonstrating that increased symptoms of social anxiety were associated with decreased social functioning in the CHR group. Additionally, a supplemental analysis found that the CHR group had significantly lower social functioning compared to the CC group (SM). The related supplemental analysis also examined social functioning by categorical diagnoses within the CHR group only and found no significant difference between individuals in the CHR group by SAD diagnosis of SAD (SM).
Discussion
Individuals at CHR for psychosis showed approximately 3 times greater risk of having a SAD diagnosis relative to a heterogenous CC sample and showed a specific vulnerability to SAD. While the CHR group demonstrated an increased risk for both SAD and other anxiety-related diagnoses compared to the CC group, the risk of having a non-SAD anxiety diagnosis was approximately half of the relative risk of having a SAD diagnosis. Furthermore, the severity of social anxiety symptoms was related to both increased severity of negative symptoms and reduced social functioning among CHR individuals. Interestingly, social anxiety symptoms are related to negative and not positive symptoms. These results suggest that social anxiety is prevalent in people that meet the criteria for CHR syndrome and may be an important area of further study to address social difficulties and negative symptoms in those in the psychosis risk period. Collectively, these findings provide insight into the scope of social anxiety and its clinical and functional importance among CHR

individuals, in particular, when compared to their peers in the general population.
Individuals at CHR for psychosis are at greater risk of having a comorbid SAD relative to their CC peers. Indeed, the relative risk of having comorbid SAD was greater than the risk of having another anxiety-related disorder in CHR individuals compared to their CC counterparts. The findings of the current study provide new evidence that SAD may be more common than other anxiety disorders in CHR individuals. Consistent with previous studies,13-15,17 approximately 42% of the CHR group met criteria for comorbid SAD; matching an estimate from a previous study16 exactly. By using a general community sample, the current study advances previous findings that CHR populations have an increased prevalence of social anxiety compared to their peers in two ways. First, the use of a general community sample reduces the bias in a traditionally nonpsychiatric sample toward lower rates of SAD.20,21 Second, as it is unlikely that we underestimated the rates of social anxiety in our control participants, we can be confident that the CHR group has a 3-fold greater risk of having social anxiety compared to community peers. This difference in prevalence suggests that social anxiety may be a critical area for future research to focus on the contribution of social anxiety to mechanisms of psychosis, treatment, and outcome.
Within the CHR group, social anxiety was also related to symptom severity for negative but not positive symptoms. This finding is consistent with results by McAusland et al.18 that report that social anxiety symptoms were related to negative symptoms. Additionally, work by Mazeh et al.6 demonstrated that avoidant cognitions within social anxiety were specifically associated with negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. However, it is also possible that social anxiety contributes to secondary negative symptoms in a primary/secondary negative symptom theoretical framework.48,49 This theory postulates that negative symptoms are considered primary if they are a direct result of psychosis but are considered secondary if they are driven by other mechanisms, such as social anxiety.49 For example, negative symptoms in CHR individuals, such as asociality, could be due to social anxiety and not a result of CHR syndromes. The current study provides support for the potential for social anxiety to be a treatment target for future investigation to improve negative symptom severity. To further clarify our understanding here, future studies should examine specific features of social anxiety (eg, avoidance and fear6) as well. In addition to symptoms, social anxiety was related to deficits in social function among those at CHR for psychosis. This finding was consistent with established results from previous literature that social anxiety and social functioning impairments were present in patients with a psychosis spectrum diagnosis22,50 and in CHR individuals.27
In a supplemental analysis, social functioning did not differ among CHR individuals with and without a

comorbid SAD diagnosis. This categorical approach revealed a great deal of heterogeneity in social anxiety symptoms and social functioning by diagnosis, which masked a relationship between social anxiety symptoms and social functioning that were apparent when social anxiety symptoms were examined dimensionally (SM figure 1). Parallel supplemental analyses revealed that positive, but not negative, symptoms were greater in CHR individuals with a comorbid diagnosis of SAD. It is possible that positive symptoms are only related to social anxiety when the social anxiety levels are sufficiently high to meet diagnostic criteria, but warrants further investigation. This supplemental finding speaks to the differences between categorical diagnosis and subthreshold levels of social anxiety, as the relationship between negative symptoms and social anxiety was evident when social anxiety was measured using dimensional symptom level. Further, this result suggests that attenuated positive symptoms may be more relevant to diagnostically significant SAD. Additionally, there is a notable challenge of disentangling primary negative symptoms from those that are secondarily caused by other psychopathology, such as social anxiety. Collectively these supplemental findings highlight the benefit of examining social anxiety symptoms dimensionally and suggest that diagnostic heterogeneity may partially account for inconsistent findings in previous literature.
The current study advances the generalizability of previous findings and clarifies the complex nature of social functioning in the early identification of psychosis. Future studies should explore the potential for extant treatments targeted at social anxiety that might improve social functioning in individuals at risk for psychosis as a strategy to improve quality of life. Additionally, future studies should examine the impact of social anxiety on social support, as social support has direct implications for psychosis course.51 It is also noteworthy that psychosocial interventions, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, are well-established treatments for social anxiety, thus improving social functioning.24,52,53 In conclusion, social anxiety reflects an opportunity for low-risk interventions that may increase social functioning.
Although this study has strength in its external validity, there are some notable limitations. First, the current study has no follow-up information that could provide insight into future clinical course and conversion to psychosis. Second, the study sample had a higher proportion of females, which was reflective of the larger MAP study from which these participants were recruited. Although there were no significant differences in the number of males and females across the experimental groups, social anxiety affects more women than men,16 with odds ratios ranging between 1.5 and 2.2.54 Therefore, females within each experimental group may be overestimating the true prevalence and severity in both the CHR and CC groups. However, it is noteworthy that the current recruitment

Social Anxiety and Psychosis-Risk

approach differs from the typical help-seeking recruitment approach,34 meaning that traditional help-seeking samples may be more severe. The current study was limited to CHR individuals with persistent or progressive symptoms rather than those whose symptoms were improving. As such, prospective, longitudinal studies examining social anxiety in individuals whose symptoms have improved (APSS remission) may further shed light on complex relationships between psychosis-risk, anxiety, clinical course, and functioning. Due to the considerable comorbidity between depression and anxiety-related psychopathology, the current study was unable to meaningfully parse apart their individual relationship to psychosis-risk symptoms (SM) and warrants future investigation. A notable limitation of the current study, as well as the current literature broadly, is that there is no in-depth self-report measure of social functioning specifically designed for people at clinical high risk. This highlights the necessity to either develop measures catered to this clinical population or to validate existing measures that were developed for psychosis populations for use within CHR individuals. Additionally, the results of the current study could be extended by examining the relationship of social anxiety with specific domains of social functioning (eg, withdrawal/social engagement, prosocial behavior, and recreation).

abstract: Objectives: This study aimed to compare changes in medical students' research practices and perceptions of two cohorts of graduates. Methods: This cross-sectional comparative study was conducted from November 2014 to December 2017 and included the 2015 and 2017 medical graduates of King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A validated self-administrated questionnaire, which included questions about participants' age and gender, research activities, and obstacles to and motivators for research involvement was used. Results: A total of 484 graduates were included in this study (response rate: 96.8%). A significant difference was found between the 2015 and 2017 graduates who had not started any research project (48.4% versus 35%; P <0.001) and a 20% increase in the 2017 graduates' confidence in their abilities to start their own projects was observed (P <0.001). Significantly more 2017 graduates were engaged in various research roles, other than 'author', compared to 2015 graduates (71.3% versus 55.4%; P <0.001). Career progression was the main motivator for both the 2015 and 2017 medical graduates to participate in research (79.5%). Reported obstacles to research included a lack of dedicated time for research and methodology training and a shortage of research project opportunities. Conclusion: This study highlights positive changes in attitudes towards and perceptions of research among medical graduates.

Research is an essential component of medicine as it plays a vital role in advancing scientific knowledge.1 Clinicians are required to make decisions based on the best available evidence. This practice can only be accomplished with optimum understanding of research principles.2 In order to improve medical practice and scientific knowledge, research activities should be encouraged and implemented in the undergraduate years.3
Encouraging medical students to participate in research can help them develop skills associated with communication, teamwork, time management and independent learning. As students gain research experience, they in turn are motivated to pursue a career in research. Further, participating in research at an early stage in education could help students establish a positive perspective towards science and scientific methodologies.4-7
Understanding the attitude of undergraduate students and graduates towards research can improve research practice in the postgraduate period.8 Shahbaz et al.'s study conducted in Lahore with undergraduate university students found that 86% believed research was an essential aspect of their field of study; however, only 33% had previous research experience.9 In addition, Ibrahim et al.'s study in Egypt revealed that 69% of medical students believed that research experience would greatly help their long-term career objectives, yet only 11% had published a paper.10
Several studies have been conducted in Saudi Arabia to understand medical students' perceptions of their research practice. A study conducted in Makkah's Umm Al-Qura University with undergraduate students in the health colleges revealed that only 6.6% had published research-based writing.11 Another study conducted in Jeddah in 2010 with medical graduates of King Abdulaziz University found that 31% had co-authored research papers, with only 3.2% being first authors.12
At King Abdulaziz University, research is an essential part of the undergraduate curriculum. At the time of this paper's writing, students had no graduation requirements to participate in a research project. However, during their third, fourth and fifth years of medical school, the university offered lectures and assignments designed to teach undergraduates the basics of research, such as idea formation, data acquisition and analysis, manuscript writing and how to appraise research articles. The current study aimed to compare research practices and perceptions among undergraduate medical students who graduated in 2015 and 2017 from King Abdulaziz University.
These two groups were chosen because of increased efforts around improving research awareness over the two years preceding this study, in part due to a new unit established to deliver free workshops emphasising

the importance of research. In addition, in Jeddah in 2016, a summer school was established to encourage undergraduate students to participate in research by providing them with research opportunities. Finally, the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS), the organisation responsible for postgraduate studies in Saudi Arabia, announced that conducting research, authoring papers and presenting at conferences would improve a medical graduate's likelihood of admission into postgraduate programmes.
Methods
This comparative cross-sectional study was conducted at King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, between November 2014 and December 2017. The study included 2015 and 2017 medical school graduates who had completed six years of an undergraduate medical programme and were in their internship years during the data collection phase. Both groups were approached in person or through mobile phone text messages. This population was chosen due to ease of access and because the graduates were in the process of applying to postgraduate programmes and would therefore be aware of research.
This study used a validated, self-administered, online questionnaire that was originally used in a study conducted in the same setting; permission was taken from the primary author to use this tool in the current study.12 The questionnaire comprised 29 questions, including questions about age, gender and grade point average (GPA). Further questions sought information about research activities, motivators to be active in research, obstacles affecting research progress and measures to improve research involvement. Graduates' answers were classified according to a Likert scale and were rated from strongly disagree to strongly agree (1-5, respectively).
Data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS), Version 16 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA) and were expressed as numbers and percentages. A chi-squared test was used to assess whether the data followed a random distribution. A P value of <0.005 was considered statistically significant.
Consent was collected after the purpose of the study was thoroughly explained to the participants. Ethical approval was received for this study from the Ethical Committee of King Abdulaziz University (62261\39\d).
Results
A total of 500 medical graduates were contacted and 484 completed the questionnaire (response rate: 96.8%)

Graduates identified career progression as the main motivator to participate in research (79.5%), followed by a motivation to improve academic performance (60%) and pursue research interests (33.5%). In addition, peer pressure to carry out research was significantly higher among the 2017 graduates than the 2015 graduates (18% versus 7.6%; P <0.001) [Table 3].
In terms of barriers to active research, a lack of dedicated time (73.4%) and methodology training (69.6%) were identified as major obstacles by the 2015 graduates. On the other hand, the 2017 graduates reported that the main barriers to being more active in research was a lack of dedicated research time (66.3%) and a paucity of available research projects (60%) [Table 4].
The majority (60.8%) believed that including a onemonth rotation devoted to research during the internship period could be an effective approach to enhancing research activities. In addition, 60.3% agreed that a 2-3-month rotation would have the same benefit.

Discussion
This study aimed to compare research practice and perception among 2015 and 2017 graduates of an undergraduate medical programme in Saudi Arabia. The findings highlight the effect of increased awareness of the importance of research and a change in researchspecific criteria for post-graduate programme acceptance.
Two main findings emerged from this study. First, significantly more 2017 graduates were active in research compared to 2015 graduates (P <0.001). Second, the researchers noted a pronounced boost in graduates' confidence in their ability to author and submit research independently, demonstrating a positive change in attitudes and perceptions.

In this study, 65% of the 2017 graduates indicated they had begun their own research project in comparison to 51.6% of the 2015 graduates. This finding could be explained by an increased awareness of the importance of involvement in research through the activities of student research units and the changes that occurred in the SCFHS criteria of admission into postgraduate programmes. It is worth noting that research involvement of both the 2015 and 2017 graduates is higher than other studies done in Sweden and Brazil.13,14 However, both of these studies were conducted on medical students, while our study was conducted on medical graduates, who had more time to be involved in research.
In the current study, the confidence of the graduates to start their own projects without supervision increased significantly in 2017, possibly due to those graduates' increased involvement in research-promoting activities (P <0.001). Past research has noted that students' active participation in research can improve their confidence in and understanding of research, in addition to increasing their interest in pursuing research-based careers in the postgraduate period.15 However, graduates expressed concerns about not having sufficient research opportunities in their university. This finding could indicate that even though barriers were present, students found alternative solutions to increasing research involvement, such as eliciting support from supervisors from different universities and attending summer schools or focused workshops that provided research opportunities.
This observed high level of confidence and increased research practice could be a result of reporting

bias or sample bias, as the students may have wanted to over-represent their achievements and the sample of this study only included medical programme graduates. A study conducted in Madinah, Saudi Arabia revealed a direct relationship between students' academic year and their research involvement.3 Therefore, further research is needed to analyse research practices among students of all academic years to better understand students' perceptions at all levels of education.
Career progression was one of the main motivators for research involvement for both the 2015 and the 2017 graduates, which is similar to findings from studies conducted in King Abdulaziz University, University College Cork and Universiti Sains Malaysia.16,17 Furthermore, peer pressure to carry out research was found to have significantly increased in the 2017 cohort comparing to the 2015 cohort (P <0.001). This increase may be attributed to increasing competition between graduates or the more stringent research recommendations implemented by the SCFHS in 2017.
Graduates identified many barriers affecting their research participation. Both 2015 and 2017 graduates agreed that lack of time negatively impacted their research practice (73.4% and 66.3%). Similar obstacles to research were reported by medical students in another Saudi Arabian study conducted in five medical schools.18 These findings also concur with those of a study done in the United Kingdom, where 74% of their sample reporting that time constraints acted as a crippling barrier to their research activities.19 The persistence of this obstacle indicates the importance of allocating time dedicated specifically to research.
The majority (60%) of the 2017 graduates believed that there was a shortage in the number of available research projects, indicating a need for more enthusiastic faculty members and summer schools to provide more research opportunities for interested students. It is worth noting that starting from 2021, authoring a research project will become a prerequisite for graduation from King Abdulaziz University. This positive change can play an important role in improving students' future participation in research.
The current study noted an improvement in knowledge regarding the existence of research methodology training, possibly because of the free workshops conducted by the students' research unit. This positive change indicates that plans to improve students' research practice are succeeding; however, more efforts are needed to ensure the adequacy of the given lectures and workshops. This obstacle represents a serious barrier to students' research practice, as reported in similar studies conducted in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.9,12
The primary limitation of this study is that the data was collected from the graduates via a data collection

tool and not through one-on-one interviews. Qualitative interview-based studies can help researchers better understand graduates' perceptions of research and find solutions to increase their research involvement. Additionally, conducting this study with a larger sample and including graduates and students from several universities and different academic years could give more insight into how to improve students' and graduates' practices and perceptions of research.
Conclusion
This study highlighted positive changes in attitudes and perceptions of research among graduates of a medical programme in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. However, it still demonstrates the importance of providing more research opportunities and research-based lectures as well as matching supervisors with medical students and recent graduates in order to ensure the quality of their conducted research.

Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common malignancy with a high morbidity and mortality rate worldwide, but the driver genes and signaling pathways involved are largely unclear. Herein, our study aimed to identify significant genes with poor outcome and underlying mechanisms in NSCLC using bioinformatics analyses. Methods: Gene expression profiles (GSE33532, GSE19188, GSE102287, GSE27262), including 319 NSCLC and 232 adjacent lung tissues, were downloaded from the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by the GEO2R online tool. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed via the DAVID database. The protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of these DEGs were constructed by the STRING website and visualized by the Cytoscape software platform. The expression of hub genes in NSCLC was validated through the GEPIA database. Kaplan-Meier plotter was used to analyse the survival rate with multivariate Cox regression. The expression of protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2) in NSCLC and adjacent lung tissues was evaluated on the UALCAN database platform. Results: A total of 225 significant DEGs were obtained between NSCLC and adjacent lung tissues, containing 52 upregulated genes and 173 downregulated genes. The DEGs were clustered based on functions and signaling pathways that may be closely associated with NSCLC occurrence. A total of 174 DEGs were identified from the PPI network complex. Top 10 hub genes were selected by CytoHubba plugin. As independent predictors, seven genes (COL1A1, ADAM12, VWF, OGN, EDN1, CAV1, ITGA8) were associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC via multivariate Cox regression (P<0.01). Four genes (VWF, CAV1, ITGA8, COL1A1) were found to be significantly enriched in the focal adhesion pathway (P=1.04E-04) and to be upstream regulators of PTK2. PTK2 was upregulated in NSCLC and associated with poor survival prognosis in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Conclusions: Taken together, the important genes and pathways in NSCLC were identified by using integrated bioinformatics analysis. PTK2 could be a key gene associated with the biological process of NSCLC formation and progression and a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment.

Introduction
Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the world (1). Lung cancer is classified as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC is significantly more common than SCLC and is further subdivided based on histology (e.g., adenocarcinoma, squamous or large cell carcinoma) (2,3). Despite the introduction of several new and more effective biomarkers in clinical practice, only 25% of NSCLC patients are diagnosed at stage I-II when NSCLC patients are still amenable to radical surgery (4). The 5-year survival is 77-92% for clinical stage IA, 68% for stage IB, 60% for stage IIA, and 53% for stage IIB (5). Radical surgery indeed improved the 5-year survival rates for patients with stage I-II NSCLC. However, most NSCLC patients are diagnosed at a late stage due to the typically asymptomatic early stage and the lack of effective screening trial. These patients with advanced NSCLC are not amenable to radical surgery, but up to 69% of them could have a potentially actionable molecular target (6). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are the most common oncogenic drivers in NSCLC. Although EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and ALK TKI treatment show an encouraging improvement in overall survival, nearly all patients eventually have disease progression due to acquired resistance after treatment (7). The reduction of NSCLC mortality has been set as a major priority worldwide by detecting new molecular targets and prompting the development of new therapies.
Traditional gene-by-gene approaches in research are insufficient to meet the growth and demand of biological research in understanding true biology. In recent years, bioinformatics analysis has identified a group of cancer related genes that provide insight into the molecular mechanism of diseases progression (8,9). Nevertheless, there are few studies of NSCLC via these bioinformatics analyses. In this paper, bioinformatics analysis was utilized to explore the potential biomarkers and the molecular mechanism of NSCLC.
We present the following article in accordance with the REMARK reporting checklist (available at https://tcr. amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/tcr-21-1986/rc).
Methods
In this paper, original microarray datasets were downloaded

711
from GEO. DEGs between NSCLC and adjacent lung tissue were filtered via the GEO2R online tool. The functions and pathway enrichment of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified via the DAVID online database. The protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of these DEGs were constructed by the STRING website and visualized by the Cytoscape software platform. The GEPIA database was used to evaluate the expression of genes. Kaplan-Meier plotter was used to analyse the survival rate with multivariate Cox regression. The expression of protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2) was analysed via the UALCAN database. All procedures performed in this study involving human participants were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in 2013).
Microarray data information and DEGs identification
NCBI-GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/) is a functional genomics database that includes microarray and cutting edge sequencing. Four original microarray datasets (GSE33532, GSE19188, GSE102287, and GSE27262) were downloaded from the NCBI-GEO database, from which data on 319 NSCLC and 232 adjacent lung tissues was available. DEGs between NSCLC and adjacent lung tissue were filtered via the GEO2R online tool with P<0.05 and (logFC) >2 (10). The overlapping DEGs among the four datasets were identified through the Venn diagram database (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/). The DEGs with logFC >0 were the upregulated genes; in contrast, which gene was the downregulated gene with logFC <0.
Gene functional and pathways enrichment analysis
Gene ontology (GO), which comprises 3 independent ontologies (cellular component, molecular function, and biological process), is the most comprehensive and widely used knowledge base concerning the functions of genes (11). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) is a database resource for understanding the high-level functions and utilities of biological systems (12). DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp) is a comprehensive functional annotation tool for investigators to understand the biological meaning behind a large list of genes (13). In the present study, the functions and pathway enrichment of the DEGs were identified via the DAVID online database. P<0.05 was used as the cut-off criterion.

PPI network and module analysis
The PPI network of the proteins encoded by DEGs was constructed via the STRING database (https://cn.stringdb.org/) (14). The Cytoscape software platform (https:// cytoscape.org/) was utilized to construct and visualize the PPI network with a maximum number of inter actors =0 and confidence score 0.4 (15). The nodes represent the genes, and the edges between the nodes represent the interactions between the genes in the PPI network.
Expression and survival analysis of hub genes in NSCLC
The expression of hub genes between NSCLC and adjacent lung tissues was compared through the GEPIA database (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/) (16). NSCLC patients were divided into low- and high-expression groups according to the median expression of each hub gene. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed via Kaplan-Meier plotter (https:// kmplot.com/analysis/) (17). P value includes correction for multiple hypothesis testing. P<0.05 indicated that the difference was statistically significant.
Expression and survival analysis of PTK2 in NSCLC
The UALCAN database (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/)

was employed to analyse the expression of PTK2 between NSCLC and adjacent lung tissues (18). The survival prognosis of PTK2 was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier plotter.
Statistical analysis
Bioinformatics analyses of databases were described in detail in the above method. The two-sided Student's t-test was used to compare the differences between groups. Differences between groups were compared using a twosided Student's t-test. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed via Kaplan-Meier plotter. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Microarray data information and DEGs identification
Four original microarray datasets (GSE33532, GSE19188, GSE102287 and GSE27262) were obtained from the NCBI-GEO database. A total of 3188 DEGs were extracted via the GEO2R online tool using P<0.05 and (logFC) >2 as cut-off criteria. A total of 225 common DEGs were identified through the Venn diagram database, including 52 upregulated genes and 173 downregulated genes in NSCLC tissue compared to adjacent lung tissues (Table 1, Figure 1).

Gene function and pathways enrichment analysis
Functions and pathway enrichment of DEGs were conducted using the DAVID database. The DEGs were classified into three functional groups: biological process group (BP), cellular component group (CC) and molecular function group (MF) (Figure 2, Table 2). In the BP group, the cell division GO term enriched both upregulated and downregulated DEGs, which indicates that the biological process of cell division may play vital roles in the development of NSCLC. In addition, the upregulated DEGs were also involved in mitotic nuclear division and sister chromatid cohesion, while the downregulated DEGs were involved in angiogenesis and the BMP signaling pathway. In the CC group, the upregulated DEGs were enriched in spindle, midbody and condensed chromosome kinetochore, while the downregulated DEGs were enriched in cell surface, extracellular region and extracellular space. In the MF group, the overexpressed DEGs mainly included molecular functions of ATP binding, metalloendopeptidase activity and protein homodimerization activity, whereas the downregulated genes included those of heparin binding, receptor activity and transforming growth factor beta binding.
As shown in Table 3, KEGG analysis results demonstrated that the upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in oocyte meiosis, the cell cycle and the p53 signaling pathway, while the downregulated DEGs were particularly enriched in malaria, vascular smooth muscle contraction and the PPAR signaling pathway.

PPI network and module analysis
A total of 174 DEGs, including 48 upregulated genes and 126 downregulated genes, were filtered into the PPI network complex, which included 174 nodes and 816 edges, via the STRING database and Cytoscape software platform (Figure 3A). There were 51 of the 225 DEGs that failed to fall into the PPI network. Two significant modules in the PPI network complex were collected for further analysis using the MCODE plugin of the Cytotype software platform. A total of 32 central nodes and 511 edges were identified in module 1, and all 32 central nodes were upregulated genes and mainly associated with the oocyte meiosis, the cell cycle, the p53 signaling pathway and the progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation (Figure 3B, Table 4). In addition, module 2, which included 9 nodes and 29 edges, was mainly associated with the PI3K-Akt and HIF-1 signaling pathways (Figure 3C, Table 4). The CytoHubba plugin was used to identify the top 10 hub genes (COL1A1, ITGA8, VWF, MMP1, ADAM12, CD36, OGN, EDN1, CTHRC1 and CAV) in the PPI network (Figure 3D, Table 4), which were mainly involved in ECMreceptor interaction, focal adhesion, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.

significantly upregulated (P<0.05), whereas VWF, CD36, OGN, EDN1, CAV1 and ITGA8 were significantly downregulated (P<0.05) in NSCLC (Figure 4A). Survival curves were generated to assess the diagnostic efficiency of the 10 hub genes via Kaplan-Meier plotter. As shown in Figure 4B, two upregulated genes (COL1A1 and ADAM12) and five downregulated genes (VWF, OGN, EDN1, CAV1, and ITGA8) were significantly associated with survival prognosis in NSCLC (P<0.01).
Reanalysis of hub genes via KEGG enrichment analysis
KEGG enrichment analysis was reanalyzed to explore the possible pathways of the 7 hub genes via the DAVID database. Four genes (VWF, CAV1, ITGA8, COL1A1) were markedly enriched in the focal adhesion pathway (P=1.04E-04) and were upstream regulators of FAK (PTK2) (Table 5).
Expression and survival analysis of PTK2 in NSCLC
The expression of PTK2 between NSCLC and adjacent

lung tissues was analysed using the UALCAN database. Compared to adjacent lung tissues, PTK2 was significantly overexpressed in both lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) (P<0.01, Figure 5A,5B). PTK2 was associated with a poor prognosis in LUSC (HR =1.43, P<0.05, Figure 5C) but not in LUAD (HR =0.69, P>0.05, Figure 5D).
Discussion
NSCLC is the most common malignant cancer and has the fourth lowest survival rate of cancer types worldwide (19). Although numerous basic and clinical studies have been conducted to reveal the causes and underlying mechanisms of NSCLC formation and progression, the gene and mechanism of gene expression in NSCLC have not been systematically studied.
This study utilized bioinformatics methods to deeply analyse the four profile datasets downloaded from the GEO database. A total of 225 DEGs were obtained via the DAVID online database and classified into three groups (MF, BP and CC groups) by GO terms. The cell division

(A) The PPI network consisted of 174 nodes and 816 edges (48 upregulated genes marked in red, 126 downregulated genes marked in green); (B) module 1 was composed of 32 nodes and 511 edges; (C) module 2 was composed of 9 nodes and 29 edges; (D) the top 10 hub genes were identified by the cytoHubba plugin. PPI, protein-protein interaction; DEGs, differentially expressed genes.

GO term enriched both upregulated and downregulated DEGs, which indicates that the biological process of cell division may play vital roles in the development of NSCLC. For pathway analysis, upregulated DEGs were particularly enriched in oocyte meiosis, cell cycle and the p53 signaling pathway, while downregulated DEGs were enriched in malaria, vascular smooth muscle contraction and the PPAR signaling pathway (P<0.05). As a tumor inhibitor, p53 plays a pivotal role in cell biological functions, such as

cell cycle progression, DNA damage response, apoptosis, senescence, and angiogenesis (20). Tac2-N (TC2N) acts as a novel oncogene by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting the proliferation of lung cancer cells by inhibiting the p53 signaling pathway (21).
On the basis of CytoHubba plugin of the Cytoscape software platform, the top 10 hub genes were identified, which were mainly involved in ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Four

of the top 10 genes were enriched in the focal adhesion pathway and were upstream regulators of FAK (PTK2), including VWF, CAV1, ITGA8 and COL1A1. The integrinactivated adhesion kinase (FAK)-mediated signaling pathway is an important pathway in tumor invasion and metastasis (22). PTK2, as an adhesion protein kinase, plays an important role in the FAK-mediated signaling pathway, which includes the transduction of signals released from integrins and growth factor receptors (23-25). In the present study, PTK2 expression was significantly higher in NSCLC than in adjacent lung tissues. Moreover, PTK2 overexpression has been associated with poor survival in LUSC, while no correlation has been found in LUAD. As in our study, multiple studies demonstrated that PTK2 is overexpressed and/or activated in many tumor types, including NSCLC (26-30). It was previously reported that PTK2 overexpression evaluated by IHC has been correlated with worse overall survival (31,32). These above data illustrate that PTK2 may play an important role in tumour formation and progression. Therefore, small-molecule inhibitors targeting the PTK2 kinase domain have been

undergoing preclinical and clinical investigation and induce cancer regression in solid cancers, including NSCLC (33-37). As a robust inhibition of PTK2, PF-562, 271 provides the potential to enhance cancer therapy with its novel target and dual antitumor and antiangiogenesis mechanisms of action and represents an unprecedented approach to NSCLC treatment through PTK2 inhibition (38).
Conclusions
In summary, 225 DEGs were identified in the current study. Among them, four hub genes were found, which were enriched in the focal adhesion pathway and were upstream regulators of PTK2. PTK2 may be a key oncogene leading to tumour formation and progression and associated with poor survival in NSCLC. However, clinical experiments are urgently needed to evaluate the molecular role of PTK2 in NSCLC. As a biomarker of NSCLC, the molecular mechanisms and clinical application of PTK2 require exploration in future studies.

ABSTRACT
Antrodia cinnamomea is a unique medicinal fungus in Taiwan. It has been found rich in some pharmacologically active compounds for anti-cancer, hangover, and immune regulation etc. With the in-depth study of these components, it would be interesting and important to establish a molecular system for basic studies of A. cinnamomea. Thus, we would like to set up a foundation for this purpose by studying the A. cinnamomea protoplast preparation and regeneration. Firstly, we studied the optimization method of protoplast preparation of A. cinnamomea, and found various factors that may affect the yield during protoplast preparation, such as mycelial ages, pH values, and osmotic stabilizers. Secondly, in the regeneration of protoplasts, we explored the effects of various conditions on the regeneration of protoplasts, including different media and osmotic pressure. In addition, we found that citrate buffer with pH value around 3 dramatically increased the regeneration of protoplasts of A. cinnamomea, and provided a set of regeneration methodology for A. cinnamomea.

KEYWORDS Antrodia cinnamomea; citrate buffer; medicinal fungus; protoplast preparation; protoplast regeneration

1. Introduction
Filamentous fungi are widely existing in the field, and their secondary metabolites are commonly used in all aspects of our daily life. The Antrodia cinnamomea is a unique slow growing filamentous and medicinal fungus in Taiwan. Its medicinal use was reported in many studies, such as functions in antioxidant [1,2], anti-cancer [3], anti-virus [4], and anti-biotics [3] activities. Because of its broad spectrum of medicinal application and extremely slow growth rate, A. cinnamomea is now considered as one of the most expensive herbal medicines in the market.
In the natural environment, A. cinnamomea only parasitizes on the hollow trunk of Cinnamomum kanehirai, a large evergreen broad-leaved tree that grows on broad-leaved forests at altitude between 200 and 2000 meters in Taiwan [5]. Because of decreasing population of C. kanehirai caused by deforestation, the wild A. cinnamomea is fewer and more expensive. Thus, researchers have been working on all aspects with this fungus, including medical effects [6], secondary metabolite identification and profiling [7], fruiting body formation and production [8], gene transformation [9], and molecular biology [10]. Based on the research perspective,

protoplast preparation and regeneration may provide a useful tool for further basic and applied researches of A. cinnamomea.
The cell wall is a very important cellular structure of certain organisms such as plants, fungi, algae and bacteria. It carries various functions such as supporting cell configuration, providing permeability barriers, and protecting cells in harmful environments. The cells without cell walls are called protoplasts. As well as plant cells, the protoplasts produced from fungi have totipotency which can be induced to regenerate a new individual by external stimuli [11]. Cell walls can be removed through mechanical or enzymatic methods to produce protoplasts [12]. The fungal cell walls are composed of polymers such as dextran, chitin, mannose, and manno-proteins. The chemical compositions of the cell walls varied depending on the fungal species, growth environments, and cell growth patterns [13]. These variables make the composition and structure of the cell wall different, so the digestion of cell wall. The required digestive enzymes, such as chitinases, cellulases and proteases, vary depending on the cell wall structure. Therefore, the enzyme mixture selected from the appropriate components and ratios is a key factor for protoplast preparation.

In addition, protoplasts are very sensitive to osmotic pressure during the cell wall digestion of filamentous fungi. It requires isotonic solution of specific salts or sugars to preserve protoplast integrity during the entire preparation process. Such substances used to stabilize osmotic pressure are called osmotic stabilizers and used to maintain cell conformation and prevent cell membrane breakage [14]. Due to the lack of a cell wall barrier, basic studies on cell membranes and organelles can be performed easier, such as cell fusion, gene transformation, microinjection [15].
In many studies, the A. cinnamomea extract has been found to contain many therapeutically effective ingredients even with the potential to develop anticancer drugs [16]. With the in-depth study of A. cinnamomea, more functional genes and metabolic pathways will be explored in the future. Therefore, we would like to establish a procedure of high-efficiency system for protoplast preparation and regeneration which may be applied in subsequent A. cinnamomea-related researches.

size (BD FalconTM, Sparks, MA, USA) three times to remove the broken hyphae, and the conidia were washed with sterilized water at 3000 g for 10 min to remove any debris by 3 times. The conidia collected were counted on a cell counter and the concentration of the conidia was adjusted. A total of 1  109 conidia were cultured in 50 mL malt extract broth (MEB; 2% glucose, 2% malt extract, 0.1% peptone) at 160 rpm and 25 C.
2.4. Hyphal preparation for protoplast preparation
For preparation of protoplasts, the hyphal materials were collected from the MEB liquid media inoculated with conidia with the addition of 0.024% MgSO4 (Merck KGaA). The MEB was adjusted to pH 4.5 with HCl. The cultured hyphae were collected by centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min. The new mycelia, called germlings, germinated from the conidia is about 20-40 mm.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Fungal strains and chemicals
The A. cinnamomea strain 1337-3 is a monokaryotic haploid strain of a single basidiospore isolate derived from the field-collected dikaryotic haploid A. cinnamomea strain 1337 and is publicly available from Bioresource Collection and Research Center (BCRC), Hsinchu, Taiwan (http://www.bcrc.firdi.org. tw) with catalog number BCRC MU30687 Antrodia cinnamomea 1337-3. All the chemicals used were of analytical grade or higher.
2.2. Growth of A. cinnamomea
The A. cinnamomea was grown in a so-called 50% malt extract agar (MEA) composed of 1% glucose (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), 1% malt extract, 0.05% peptone and 2% agar (Becton, Dickinson & Co, Sparks, MD, USA) by weight/volume [10]. The medium is sterilized at 121 C for 30 min. A 90  10 mm petri dish containing 50% MEA was inoculated with a 2  2 mm agar blot with full grown fungus. The fungus was incubated at 25 C in the dark. The whole processes were under aseptic condition.
2.3. Preparation of the conidia of A. cinnamomea 1337-3
The conidia of A. cinnamomea 1337-3 were collected from a four weeks old 50% MEA culture. The samples were gently rinsed and collected with 10 mL of sterilized water. Then, the samples were passed through a so-called cell strainer with 40 lm pore

2.5. Effects of fungal ages on protoplast preparation
In order to test the effect of enzyme digestion on the protoplast yield of different fungal ages, the new mycelia were cultured in MEB for 16, 24, 30, 36 and 48 h. After completion of the culture, the hyphae were collected by centrifugation at 2000 g for 10 min, and adjusted to 2  108 germlings per digestive tube through cell counting plate. Digestive solution with 0.9 M sucrose, 50 mM citrate buffer at pH 6.0, and 20 mg mL1 lysing enzyme (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were filter sterilized with a 0.45 mm filter tube (AcrodiscVR Syringe Filters with SuporVR Membrane; Pall Biotech, Port Washington, New York, USA). Digestive solution and the hyphae were mixed on a rotary oscillator (RT-01B; TKS, Keelung, Taiwan) with 120 rpm at 30 C. After 6 h shaking, the digest solutions were checked under microscope for the protoplast morphology and counting.
2.6. Effects of pH on protoplast preparation
For determination of pH effects on protoplast preparation, 2  108 30 h old germlings were added to a final volume of 1 mL digestive mix with 20 mg mL1 lysing enzyme and 1.1 M MgSO4 at different pH buffers. The pH buffers were prepared with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.2, pH 6.8 and pH 6.4, and with 50 mM citrate buffer at pH 6.0, pH 5.6, pH 5.2 and pH 4.8. The reaction mixes were gently shaken with 120 rpm at 30 C. The reaction conditions were checked at 3, 4, 5, and 6 h for the protoplast production.

2.7. Effects of osmotic stabilizers on protoplast preparation
Four osmotic stabilizers were tested for the protoplast preparation, including mannitol, KCl, MgSO4 and sucrose. In addition, different concentrations of these osmotic stabilizers were also tested for the effects on protoplast production at 0.7 M, 0.8 M, 0.9 M, 1.0 M, 1.1 M, 1.2 M and 1.3 M. Each reaction mix contained a fixed concentration of 20 mg mL1 lysing enzyme, 50 mM citrate buffer at pH 6.0, and 2  108 30 h old germlings as described above. The reaction mixes were gently mixed with 120 rpm at 30 C for digestion. The protoplast production was checked for quality and quantification at digestion time of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 h, respectively.
2.8. Effects of digestive enzyme concentrations on protoplast preparation
Different concentrations of digestive enzymes were tested for efficiency of the protoplast preparation. The reaction mixes contained 2  108 germlings mL1 (30 h old) with 1.1 M MgSO4, 50 mM citrate buffer at pH 6.0, the optimal pH for protoplast preparation based on above results, with 5 different concentrations of 6.25, 12.5, 25, 37.5 and 50 mg mL1 lysing enzyme at 30 C, 120 rpm. The protoplast preparation was checked for quality and quantification after 4 h of digestion.
2.9. Protoplast regeneration in solid media
The protoplasts produced through the optimal preparation procedure described above were washed with 0.8 M sucrose and span at 2000 g for 10 min. The protoplasts were then counted in a cell counting plate. The protoplast concentration was diluted to about 2  104 cells mL1, and 100 mL of protoplast preparation was plated onto a 90  20 mm petri dish plate. Different nutrient sources were tested, including potato dextrose broth (PDA with 2% agar; Becton, Dickinson & Co.), MEA with 2% agar, and non-nutrient medium (2% agar only) as the control. In addition, different concentrations of sucrose were tested at 0 M, 0.4 M, 0.6 M, 0.8 M and 1.0 M, respectively. The protoplasts were cultured in the dark at 25 C for 7 days. After 7 days of growth, the number of colonies on the culture plate was calculated for regeneration rate.
2.10. Protoplast regeneration in liquid media
The protoplast regeneration in liquid culture was carried out in five independent culture experiments. A 10 mL protoplast suspension with a concentration of 2  108 cells mL1 was added to the liquid

medium with different conditions, and cultured at 27 C, 25 rpm for 2 days. The number of regenerated protoplasts and un-regenerated protoplasts was calculated on cell counter and the regeneration rate was calculated.
2.11. Effects of osmotic pressure
The protoplasts prepared according to the optimal condition obtained in the above experiment were washed three times with 0.8 M sucrose and 2000 g for 10 min, and then counted and diluted to a concentration of about 2  108 cells mL1. A 10 mL of protoplast suspension was mixed with 990 mL of MEB with concentration of 0.6 M, 0.8 M and 1.0 M sucrose, respectively, and 50 mM citrate buffer at pH 3, 27 C and 25 rpm for 2 days. The samples were counted and observed for the effects of different osmotic pressure on the growth morphology and regeneration rate of protoplasts.
2.12. Effects of nutrient sources
A 10 mL of protoplast suspension was mixed with 990 mL of PDB, MEB and nutrient-free medium, respectively, with 0.8 M sucrose and incubated at 27 C, 25 rpm for 2 days. The samples were checked for regeneration and growth morphology.
2.13. Effects of citric acid concentrations in three different nutrient sources
The effect of different citric acid concentrations on the regeneration of protoplasts in liquid culture was carried out in combination with different nutrient sources. A 1 mL protoplast suspension with a concentration of 2  108 cells mL1 was precipitated at 2000 g, and re-suspended with PDB, MEB and non-nutrient medium with 0.8 M sucrose. The final concentration of citrate was 0, 1, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 mM, respectively. The samples were then cultured at 25 C, 25 rpm for 2 days. The samples were checked for regeneration and growth morphology.
2.14. Effects of pH values
A 1 mL protoplast suspension with a concentration of 2  108 cells mL1 was precipitated at 2000 g, and re-suspended with PDB, MEB and non-nutrient medium with 0.8 M sucrose at pH 3, pH 4, pH 5 and pH 6 buffers with a final concentration of 50 mM citrate buffer, and pH 7 and pH 8 phosphate buffers. A culture medium without pH buffer is used as a control. The samples were grown at 27 C and 25 rpm for 2 days. The culture samples were checked for the effect of different pH values on the

growth morphology of protoplasts and the protoplast regeneration rate.
2.15. Effects of citrate buffer concentration at pH 3
The citric acid at pH 3 was found to have dramatic effects on protoplast regeneration. Therefore, we made a detail test for its concentration effect on protoplast regeneration. A 1 mL protoplast suspension with a concentration of 2  108 cells mL1 was precipitated at 2000 g, and re-suspended with PDB with 0.8 M sucrose at pH 3 citrate buffer of 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 mM, and cultured at 27 C, 25 rpm for 2 days. The culture samples were checked for the effect of different pH values on the growth morphology of protoplasts and the protoplast regeneration rate.
2.16. Protoplast counting and statistical analysis
For protoplast preparation, all experiments were carried three repeats. The number of protoplasts was calculated on cell counter. The protoplasts have an average diameter around 12 mm. The protoplasts with a diameter less than 8 mm were excluded. The final values were represented as mean  standard error. For protoplast regeneration experiments, the solid state culture was carried out in three independent culture experiments. The number of colonies on each plate was measured and the regeneration rate was calculated. The values of the protoplast regeneration rate were represented as mean  standard error. The calculation method of the regeneration rate is referred to (17]. The protoplast regeneration data analysis was based on two sample t-test to compare the mean values between the two groups of samples, when p < .05 is a significant difference.

highest concentration of protoplasts at 2.1  108 cells mL1 with 4-h digestion.

3.1.3. Osmotic stabilizers
We tested 4 different osmotic stabilizers for the effects of protoplast preparation. As shown in Figure 3, the reaction mix with 1.1 M MgSO4 as osmotic stabilizer carried the best result with protoplast production at 2.1  108 cells mL1 after 4-h digestion. In addition, we would like to examine the effect of osmotic stabilizer on the stability of protoplasts. Thus, we examine the protoplast yield every h from 3 to 9 h of reaction time. As shown in Figure 3, the protoplast yields in the reaction mix with MgSO4 and KCl as osmotic stabilizers gradually decreased after 4-h digestion. On the other hand, sucrose as the osmotic stabilizer maintained a stable protoplast yield throughout the 9-h digestion. Thus, in order to obtain the maximum yield and

3.1.4. Enzyme concentrations
To obtain the optimal enzyme concentration for protoplast preparation, various concentrations of lysing enzyme were tested. As shown in Figure 4, the protoplast preparation reached the highest production when the lysing enzyme concentrations were 25 mg mL1or higher. The yield of protoplasts is about 2.0  108 cells mL1.
Taken together, based on the above experiments, we concluded the optimal condition for protoplast preparation of A. cinnamomea was as follows: fungal sample from conidial MEB culture for 30 h and at the concentration of 2  108 germlings mL1, the reaction mix was prepared with 1.1 M MgSO4, 25 mg mL1 lysing enzyme, a final concentration of 50 mM citrate buffer at pH 6.0, and incubated at 30 C, 120 rpm for 4 h. The concentration of protoplasts yielded was about 2.1  108 cells mL1. The morphology of the protoplasts prepared was shown in Figure S1.

regeneration in solid media. The colonies at different osmotic pressures and different nutrient sources were examined as shown in Figure S2. The protoplasts under different nutrient sources were compared with each other. It showed that the mycelial growth on PDA and MEA media was stronger than that of the nutrient-free medium. The colony diameter is relatively larger on PDA and MEA media rather than that on nutrient-free medium under the same osmotic pressure. The protoplast regeneration rates as shown in Figure 5 indicate that they are not statistically significant under the same osmotic pressure. However, the regeneration rate gradually increased with the increase of osmotic pressure indicating the osmotic pressure may be an important factor for the protoplast regeneration of A. cinnamomea.
3.3. Protoplast regeneration of A. cinnamomea in liquid media
3.3.1. Osmotic pressure
As shown in Figure 6(a), the sucrose concentration at 0.8 M carried the highest regeneration rate around 69.5% compared with 55.5% of 0.6 M sucrose and 30.6% of 1 M sucrose. The morphology of the protoplasts after regeneration in the liquid culture is shown in Figure 6(b). From the Figure 6(b), hyphae grown in MEB with 0.8 M sucrose are more uniform in length than that with 0.6 M sucrose. The growth and regeneration of the protoplasts in MEB with 1.0 M sucrose was poor compared with those with 0.6 M sucrose or 0.8 M sucrose.
3.3.2. Nutrient sources
The regeneration rate for MEB culture was 24.0%, followed by 23.3% in PDB culture and 21.3% with

the nutrient-free medium. However, the regeneration rates of the three media were not statistically different indicating the nutrient sources were not an important factor in the protoplast regeneration in liquid culture (data not shown).

3.3.3. Citric acid concentrations
From our preliminary experiments, we found citric acid may carry novel effects on protoplast regeneration. Thus we used above condition with addition of various concentrations of citric acid for

protoplast regeneration in liquid culture. As shown in Figure 7, addition of 1 and 10 mM citric acid significantly increased the protoplast regeneration rate (p < .05) for all three culture media. With the citric acid concentration higher than 20 mM, the regeneration rate was gradually decreased. The effect in protoplast regeneration turned into negative when the citric acid concentration higher than 80 mM.

3.3.4. pH values
Based on the study of citric acid effect on protoplast regeneration, it is interesting to us to see whether pH value may play a role in this effect. As shown in Figure 8, the regeneration rate was highest both for MEB (54.7%) and PDB (52.7%) culture at pH 3. It also shown that as pH value increased higher than pH 3, the regeneration rate of protoplasts gradually decreased. The regeneration rates between pH 5 to pH 8 were even lower than that of the control

indicating a negative effect of higher pH value for protoplast regeneration.
3.3.5. Citrate buffer concentrations at pH 3
From the above studies, citric acid and pH value at 3 may carry a significant effect in the protoplast regeneration rate. Therefore, we further examine the effect of different citrate buffer concentrations at pH 3. As shown in Figure 9, the citrate buffer at a final concentration of 80 mM had the highest regeneration rate about 71.3%.
Taken together, the optimal regeneration condition for the protoplasts of A. cinnamomea was a suspension culture in PDB with 0.8 M sucrose, a final concentration of 80 mM citrate buffer at pH 3, and cultured at 27 C, 25 rpm for 2 days. Under this condition, the morphogenesis of protoplast regeneration can be easily spotted as shown in Figure 10 that protoplast polarization, tip formation, cell wall synthesis and hyphal formation can be observed.
4. Discussion
Based on earlier study of fungal protoplast preparation [17], we examined various factors for protoplast preparation of A. cinnamomea, including strain varieties, mycelial ages, medium sources, osmotic stabilizers, digestive enzymes, digestive reaction time, temperature, and pH value. Several factors showed great impact on the yield of protoplasts.
The growth of filamentous fungi varies greatly with the external culture environment. The type of medium, pH value, temperature and culture time affect the structural composition of the fungal cell walls. As time increases, the cell wall structure reacts with various enzymes on the membrane or in the external environment, making it more complex and thickening. In order to make the structure

of the fungal cell wall consistent, the major medium used was the MEB formula as described earlier [10]. For the selection of mycelial materials, fresh hyphae with relatively simple structure and chemical composition of cell wall were used. We found the best results of protoplast preparation come from digestion of conidia with MEB cultured for 30 h. The hyphae under this condition are of

about 20-50 mm in length and more evenly distributing in suspension media making it possible to quantify the number of hyphae and calculate the relationship between the mycelial concentration and the digestive enzyme. By controlling the concentration of the substrate and the digestive enzymes we may obtain a relatively clean protoplast solution.

Different osmotic stabilizers have a considerable effect on the protoplast yield. When the protoplasts are released from the hyphae, the osmotic pressure balance stabilized both sides of the cell membrane. The osmotic stabilizer concentration is required for protection of protoplasts. If the concentration is too high, the volume of the protoplasts will be reduced and the regeneration may be inhibited. If the concentration is too low, the protoplasts will be bulky and may be broken. The osmotic stabilizer will also effect of enzyme activity, which indirectly affects the yield of protoplasts. Based on the result (Figure 3), sucrose was chosen as main osmotic stabilizer in later experiments for protoplast regeneration. Under the conditions obtained, it showed that the mycelial cell wall was almost completely digested, and no further filtration step was required to remove the cell wall debris (Figure S1). The number of protoplasts obtained was 2.1  108 cells mL1 which was much higher than earlier studies when compared with the literature on the preparation of protoplasts of A. cinnamomea [18].
After the protoplast preparation was optimized as described, subsequent experiments for protoplast regeneration were carried out. According to previous reports on fungal protoplast regeneration [19], the factors that may affect protoplast regeneration are hyphae material, osmotic stabilizer, protoplast digestion time, and medium type. Thus, we firstly selected the fungal sample at a culture stage of exponential growth phase for better protoplast regeneration. Since sucrose was the best osmotic stabilizer for the protoplast stability (Figure 3), the protoplast regeneration experiment used sucrose as the osmotic pressure stabilizer. Reaction time is also a factor that may affect the rate of protoplast regeneration. The longer the cell in protoplast form, the lower the survival rate and regeneration rate [17]. The MgSO4 was found in digestion reaction as the best osmotic stabilizer tested for protoplast production (Figure 3). Therefore, MgSO4 can shorten the digestion time and increase regeneration rate.
The reaction mix can be divided into two portions after centrifugation. The upper supernatant contained low-density and highly vacuolated protoplasts, and the bottom precipitate contained highly dense and healthy protoplasts. According to earlier studies [20], the protoplasts in bottom precipitate have higher translation ability.
In addition to cell quality, protoplast regeneration is also affected by the external environment. We studied the regeneration of protoplasts under solid and liquid culture environments. As shown in Figure 5, different nutrient sources on the solid cultures have no significant effects for protoplast regeneration. But the osmotic pressure significantly

affected the regeneration rate. In the colony morphology, it showed that PDA, MEA and control groups could produce colonies after protoplast regeneration (Figure S2), but the hyphal growth in PDA or MEA was better than that in the control. In addition, the mycelial growth was slower with the increase of osmotic stabilizer. Together, this result indicates that no nutrient in media were needed at the beginning of protoplast regeneration, but the subsequent nutrient supply after regeneration of the protoplasts allows the hyphae to continue to grow and the colonies to expand.
In term of protoplast regeneration in liquid culture, it showed that the regeneration rate was better at 0.8 M sucrose osmotic pressure rather than 0.6 M and 1.0 M sucrose (Figure 6(a)). At 0.6 M sucrose, the protoplasts had worse regeneration rate and the hyphal length was less uniform compared with the 0.8 M sucrose culture media. Fuchino et al. [21] reported that mycelial polarization occurred more often when the hyphae grew in a lower osmotic pressure. It indicated the mycelial grew faster at lower osmotic pressure than that at higher osmotic pressure. This might also be the reason for the slower expansion of fungal colonies at solid culture with high concentration sucrose for regeneration experiment (Figure S2). The regeneration of protoplasts in liquid culture with 0.6 M and 0.8 M sucrose, showed germinated protoplasts grew faster in 0.6 M sucrose but the mycelia in 0.6 M sucrose was less uniform in the filament morphology than in 0.8 M sucrose (Figure 6(b)). Based on this result, we used 0.8 M sucrose as osmotic stabilizer for the regeneration experiments.
The regeneration rate was about 23% in MEB, PDB, and nutrient-free culture media and was about doubled systematically when compared with regeneration rate in solid culture. Similar to those studies in the solid culture regeneration experiment, it showed that there was no significant difference in the regeneration rate under different nutrient sources in liquid culture. Together, we concluded that the effects of the three culture environments for protoplast regeneration of A. cinnamomea were not obvious. Earlier study [22] showed that the regeneration rates of protoplasts in different medium cultures were found different by about 5 folds and concluded that nutrient sources may be important factors for regeneration of protoplasts. That study contradicted the results of current experiment may be caused by different fungal characteristics. The A. cinnamomea is a very slow growing fungus. The time course of observation on protoplast regeneration may be more delicate and differentiate the effects of nutrient sources. Later observation on the growth rate of germinated hyphae did show the

492

J.-D. WU AND J.-C. CHOU

difference among the three medium cultures. Therefore this result provides a more dynamic view of the regeneration of fungal protoplasts.
When studied the pH effect on the protoplast regeneration, we found citric acid might increase the rate of protoplast regeneration. Thus, we further investigated this issue by adding citric acid with final concentrations of 1, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 mM in the liquid culture of PDB, MEB and nutrient-free media. As shown in Figure 7, citric acid with a final concentration of 20 mM to PDB, measured by pH meter to be pH 2.81, with the highest regeneration rate of 58.3%. The MEB with 10 mM citric acid at pH value to be 2.74 carried the highest regeneration rate of 52.7%. These results were more than 100% increase of the regeneration rate than those of the same nutrient media without citric acid. However, as a tradeoff, the higher concentration of citric acid reduced regeneration rate overtime and caused the mycelial cell wall abnormal.
The effects of citric acid in PDB and MEB media on protoplast regeneration of A. cinnamomea showed that the optimal pH should be around pH 3. This led us to further investigation of whether the pH value is an important factor for protoplast regeneration. As shown in Figure 8, various pH value of the media significantly affected the protoplast regeneration of A. cinnamomea. On the protoplast morphology, we found that as the pH of the medium increased more protoplast vesicles were produced. When compared the media at pH 8 with pH 6, the protoplasts with vesicles increased and the intracellular vesicles were significantly larger (data not shown). Based on the previous study [20], it suggested that these vesicles may be vacuoles and as an acidic organelle involved in various cellular physiological processes, such as stabilizing and regulating activities of proteins, ions, pH, osmotic pressure ... etc. The functions of vacuoles are highly related with vesicular transport and provide enzymes for cell organelles and cell membranes to maintain their physiological activities. Earlier studies [23] indicated cell polarization has a positive correlation with vacuole involvement. This is inconsistent with our results since the regeneration rate of protoplast with larger vacuoles is very low at pH 8 (Figure 8). It might be protoplasts initiated certain mechanisms to maintain their survival and adapt to adversity due to external stresses. It may change the gene expressions and cause some functional proteins and signal peptides to lose their activities, such as some cellular activities could not be effectively carried out their exocytosis [24]. Cell polarization was reduced and intracellular vacuoles may further forward autophagy pathway, when the environment continues to adversity. Induction of expanding vacuoles eventually leads to cell cycle arrest and even cell death.

In addition, we found the control group of PDB and MEB media without pH buffer had higher rates of protoplast regeneration when compared with those media with pH buffer at pH 5 or higher (Figure 8). This indirectly confirmed that A. cinnamomea better grew in a more acidic environment than pH 5. Based on earlier studies [25], the pH value of the growth environment of A. cinnamomea decreases over time. Therefore, it is believed that the protoplast may decrease the pH value of the culture environment through its own metabolic reaction to maintain an environment suitable for its growth and regeneration. According to the regeneration experiment, the optimal pH for protoplast regeneration of A. cinnamomea should be around pH 3. Therefore, we used the PDB with citrate buffer at pH 3 throughout the later experiments.
To test the effect of different concentrations of citrate buffer on the protoplast regeneration, protoplasts in PDB containing 0.8 M sucrose and citrate buffers at a final concentration of 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 mM, respectively, pH 3, were tested. The regeneration rate was calculated after shaking for 2 days at 27 C, 25 rpm. As shown in Figure 9, it had the highest regeneration rate of 71.3% at 80 mM citrate buffer in this experiment. The protoplast regeneration rate is dramatically increased from earlier report of 6.8% [18] to 71.3%. Based on the above optimal condition for protoplast regeneration of A. cinnamomea, it is easier for observation of subsequent results of protoplast regeneration, such as shown in Figure 10.
In the earlier experiments, Lu et al. [25] studied the liquid culture and fermentation efficiency of A. cinnamomea ATCC 200183 showed that the optimal germination rate after conidia culture for 24 h was between pH 2.5 and pH 3.5, which was similar to the result of this experiment. Therefore, we believe that fungal protoplast regeneration and hyphal tip polarization may have close relationship. Many studies related to the mycelial tip have been reported, including polarization, secretory pathways and various mycelial cell wall growth mechanisms [26]. Genetic studies related to fungal protoplast regeneration, however, still remain in simple culture experiments, such as testing different media types and osmotic pressures [19]. Therefore, it is needed for further studies on the relationship between tip polarization, cell wall synthesis and protoplast regeneration, and to develop a simple method for the regeneration system of fungal protoplasts.

ABSTRACT
Muddy pens can negatively affect welfare and performance of feedlot beef cattle. In some regions with temperate weather, plastic greenhouse covers, above the entire pens are used to fatten cattle in a clean and dry environment. The objective of this research was to investigate effects of greenhouse roofed pens on beef cattle feedlot performance in temperate weather. Data were collected from a feedlot located in Central Mexico between 2016 and 2019. The study included 1,062 closeouts of pens with 68,305 crossbred bulls fed in pens with or without a greenhouse roof. Feeding ranged from 82 to 210 d, depending on the initial weight of cattle, which ranged from 255 to 511 kg. For each pen, average daily dry matter intake (DMI; kg of DMI톋nimal-1톎-1), average daily gain (ADG, kg톋nimal-1톎-1), and feed efficiency (G:F, ADG/DMI) were measured. Factorial analyses were performed to test the interaction and main effects of initial weight grouping (light, medium, and heavy), roof, and season as fixed effects, and year as a random effect. None of the three-way interactions were significant (P > 0.51). There was no initial weight grouping  roof interactions for DMI and ADG (P > 0.31). There was (P = 0.03) an initial weight grouping  roof interaction for G:F, as pens of all initial weight groups had greater (P < 0.01) G:F in pens with greenhouse roof than its counterpart in pens without greenhouse roof, but the advantage was greater for pens with light cattle (0.178 vs. 0.166; P < 0.01). There was no initial weight grouping  season interactions for all variables (P > 0.39). There was no roof  season interaction for DMI (P = 0.47), but there were interactions for ADG and G:F (P < 0.01). The ADG was not different (P > 0.13) during summer and autumn based on the roofing system, but pens with greenhouse roofs had greater ADG during spring (1.70 vs. 1.61) and winter (1.68 vs. 1.64; P  0.01). The G:F was greater (P < 0.01) in all seasons for pens with a greenhouse roof, with the most prominent advantage during spring (0.173 vs. 0.160). There were main effects for cattle initial weight grouping and roof for all variables (P < 0.01). Season affected DMI and G:F (P < 0.01). Pens with greenhouse roofs had decreased DMI (9.70 vs. 9.86), greater ADG (1.67 vs. 1.63), and increased G:F (0.173 vs. 0.166) compared to pens without greenhouse roofs (P < 0.01). Pens with greenhouse roofs in feedlots located in temperate regions positively affect beef cattle performance.

INTRODUCTION
Environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, rain, wind speed and humidity, snow, and solar radiation) substantially impact livestock health status, growth, and reproductive performance. Use of open outdoor feedlots for housing cattle is increasing around the globe (Grandin, 2016). These facilities face performance challenges, including muddy conditions, keeping cattle clean, and avoiding extreme weather conditions. These threats are crucial for productivity and animal welfare; therefore, it is vital to identify strategies to address them (Mader, 2014). Heat stress affects cattle in production systems located in hot weather regions, for example, arid, tropical, and subtropical areas with temperatures above 25 캜. In contrast, cold stress has a more significant impact on cattle situated in cold regions with temperatures below 0 캜 (Graunke et al., 2011). In heat or cold stress cattle increase their energy needs, which also leads to decreased body weight gain and feed efficiency (Fox et al., 1988)

Rain, which can also exacerbate cold stress (Van Laer et al., 2014), represents a considerable limitation of outdoor feedlots because it creates a muddy environment with negative consequences for cattle (Grandin, 2016; Valadez-Noriega et al., 2019). Rain and muddy conditions increase the maintenance energy requirements of beef cattle for regulating its core temperature because when an animals' hair coat gets wet, its insulation value decreases, increasing evaporation heat losses (Van Laer et al., 2014). External insulation is determined by the combined effect of the hair coat and the layer of air surrounding the animal's body. The effectiveness of a hair coat depends on hair depth and is also affected by wind, rain, mud, and hide thickness. External insulation decreases by 20% with some mud on the lower body, 50% with mud on the lower body and sides, and 80% when the animal is severely covered with mud (NASEM, 2016). Therefore, under cold weather conditions, maintenance energy requirements can double for animals with wet and muddy hair coats, especially in windy areas (Mader, 2014).

Mud in pens harms dry matter intake (DMI) of beef cattle, Fox and Tylutki (1998) estimated a DMI reduction of 1% for every centimeter of mud depth in the pen. Thus, muddy conditions negatively impact average daily gain (ADG) and feed efficiency (G:F; Tedeschi and Fox, 2018). Additionally, navigating a muddy environment constitutes additional energy required for the animal when it moves through the mud. Smith (1971) reported cattle in open feedlots with deep mud increased energy expenditure by 30%. Valadez-Noriega et al. (2019) found cattle immersed in mud have increased morbidity for bovine respiratory disease as another negative consequence of muddy pens. Rain and mud can also cause variation in feed consumption, which increases bunk management time and the risk of metabolic problems (NRC, 1981). Finally, another primary welfare concern associated with open outdoor feedlots and muddy conditions is keeping cattle clean (Grandin, 2016).
If the annual rainfall exceeds 51 cm, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep the pen surface dry (Grandin, 2016); therefore, maintaining clean and dry pens to provide cattle optimal environment is time-consuming and increases labor costs. Central Mexico has primarily temperate weather. Therefore, heat or cold stress are not significant problems in this region; however, rain can create muddy pens in feedlots due to annual rainfall exceeding 51 cm. Data used in this research study were collected at a feedlot located at Belem, Estado de Mexico, in central Mexico. The altitude is 2,491 m, the weather is classified as temperate (Cwb), and temperatures range from 5 to 25 캜. Temperatures under or above this range are uncommon, and annual average temperature is 13 캜. The rainy season extends from May to October, with a yearly rainfall of 64 cm (SMN, 2020). In this region, 75% of annual rainfall concentrates in 4 months (June to September), hindering pen cleaning and creating muddy pens if no strategies to mitigate this issue are undertaken by the producers.
To provide comfortable conditions for feedlot cattle, producers employ intensive protocols for cleaning pens, especially from June to September when rainfall is increased; however, as mentioned above, this activity is labor and time-consuming. Furthermore, cleaning pens requires moving cattle to another pen, and this movement harms DMI, ADG, and G:F stability. Thus, beef cattle producers in central Mexico have adopted greenhouse roofs that provide shade (avoiding direct solar radiation) and rain protection for the whole pen to avoid muddy pens and provide more comfortable conditions for cattle over the feeding period. Furthermore, pens are only cleaned with this infrastructure once the feeding period is over, saving labor and upkeep costs.
Figure 1a shows a general view of the design of the pens without (left) and with (right) the greenhouse roof. Figure 1b shows a general view of the conditions of the pens during the rainy season (June to September). General specifications of the design were outlined by Valadez-Noriega et al. (2019); however, the design can have minor changes from one feedlot to another. We hypothesized pens constructed with a greenhouse roof will improve feedlot cattle performance when feedlots are located in regions with temperate weather providing a more comfortable environment and maintaining cattle clean and dry. Therefore, the objective of this research study was to investigate effects of pens with greenhouse roofs in a feedlot located in a region with temperate weather on finished beef cattle performance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Since data were obtained from preexisting databases, approval of the Animal Care and Use Committee was not needed.
Data
A total of 1,062 pen closeouts, consisting of 68,305 crossbred bulls (25% Bos taurus - 75% Bos indicus) penned by initial weight grouping (light, <300 kg; medium, 300 kg; and <360 kg; heavy, 360 kg), collected over four years (2016 to 2019) from a feedlot located in Central Mexico (Belem, Estado de Mexico, Mexico) were analyzed. Performance measurements: DMI (kg of DMI톋nimal-1톎-1), ADG (kg/d; calculated based on full initial and final weights), and G:F (ADG/DMI) were recorded per pen. There was an average number of 64.3  7.3 bulls per pen with average starting and finishing weights of 278  7 and 570  22 (light cattle), 339  6 and 580  20 (medium cattle), and 414  16 and 621  23 (heavy cattle) kg per animal. Fattening cycles commenced all year round and ranged from 82 to 210 d, depending on the initial weight grouping of the cattle; the average days on feed were 184  9, 143  9, and 125  11 d for light, medium, and heavy cattle, respectively.
Closeouts of pens were classified according to the year's season in which the fattening cycle started. As an illustration, consider the case of medium cattle with an average fattening cycle of 143 d; if the fattening cycle began in April, the closeout pertained to spring, meaning that cattle were fed from April to August (the months with the highest rainfall). Therefore, this group of cattle ended the feeding phase in summer. This classification is essential for adequate interpretation of results, and it is emphasized in the Discussion section.
The feedlot had 151 pens in the same location, grouped according to the roof cover (with [90] or without a greenhouse roof [61]). The height of the greenhouse roof was 7 m in the bunk side, and it was 5 m in the opposite extreme to facilitate air movement. For a complete description of the design of pens with greenhouse roof see Valadez-Noriega et al. (2019). Bunks were covered in all pens; in pens with the greenhouse roof, it also covered the bunk (Figure 1). In pens without the greenhouse roof, the bunk was covered by galvanized metal sheets providing 10 m of shade with approximately 5 m of height (Figure 1). Flooring was solid in all the pens without greenhouse roof, whereas pens with greenhouse roof had dirt flooring (Figure 1) with 2 m of concrete floor around the waterers and feed bunks. In all pens, the stocking density was 10 m2톌ull-1, the feed bunk space was 40 cm톌ull-1, and automatic waterers (two per pen) had potable and freshwater. It is important to highlight that the pens differed mainly on the availability of the greenhouse roof and the flooring system. The greenhouse roof provides shade and protection from rain and direct sun over the whole pen; however, it is different from an enclosure.
Upon arrival at the feedlot, bulls were weighed (to estimate the reduction of weight due to the trip), blocked by initial weight (based on weight in origin, i.e., the full initial weight; bulls were also weighed at origin), and randomly allocated to different pens (either with or without a greenhouse roof). The cattle were initiated on the feeding program on the same day of arrival. Bulls were fed with alfalfa hay for the first three days in feed. After that, bulls were gradually adapted over a 4-wk period to a high-energy diet based on steam-flaked corn.

Figure 1. (a) General view of the design of pens without and with the greenhouse roof. (b) General view of the conditions of the pens without and with the greenhouse roof during the rainy season (June to September). Pens with greenhouse roofs are covered, and they stay dry even in the rainy season. Pens without the greenhouse roof only have covered the bunk area and are muddy during the rainy season, demanding frequent cleaning.

Three diets were used during the adaptation period, and each was provided to the bulls by approximately 10 d. All diets were formulated to fulfill or exceed NRC (2000) energy, protein, minerals, and vitamins guidelines. The NEm(NEg) of the finishing diet was 1.98(1.30) Mcal톕g-1, it contained 35 ppm of monensin (Rumensin, Elanco Animal Health, Inc., Greenfield, IN, USA), 500 ppb of chromium propionate (Phi-Chrome 10x, Phibro Animal Health Corporation, Guadalajara, JA 44130, Mexico), and 500 ppm of virginiamycin (Stafac 500, Phibro Animal Health Corporation, Guadalajara, JA 44130, Mexico). The complete mixed diets were delivered two times per day. The first feed service provided 30% of the daily allotment, from 07:00 to 09:00 h. The second feed service provided 70% of the daily allotment, from 16:00 to 18:00 h. Slick feed bunk feeding strategy used was and feed bunk scores were evaluated visually and recorded every day from 06:00 to 07:00 h.
After 24 h of arrival at the feedlot, bulls received a vaccine for IBR, BVD Types 1 and 2, BRSV, PI3, and Mannheimia haemolytica (Bovi-Shield Gold One Shot, Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ, USA); an intranasal vaccine for IBR and PI3 (TSV-2, Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ, USA), and a vaccine for Clostridium chauvoei, septicum, novyi, sordellii, perfringens Types C &

D plus Haemophilus somnus (Ultrabac 7/Somubac, Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ, USA). Cattle were also treated for internal and external parasites (Baymec prolong, Elanco Animal Health, Inc., Greenfield, IN, USA), injected with A, D, and E vitamins (Vigantol ADE, Elanco Animal Health, Inc., Greenfield, IN, USA) and implanted (Synovex, Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ, USA). Cattle were reimplanted at d 60 on feed (light, medium, and heavy cattle), and at d 120 on feed (only light cattle; Revalor, Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA), that is, medium, and heavy cattle received two implants, and light cattle received three implants during the whole fattening cycle. Descriptive statistics of analyzed variables are reported in Table 1.
To investigate and describe the climatic variables and their potential effect on cattle performance, climate data with measurements collected every 10 min from January of 2016 to December of 2019 were obtained from a meteorological station (Davis Vantage Pro2 Wireless) at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (El Batan, Texcoco, Mexico). This meteorological station is located 19.5 km from the feedlot and shares the same environmental conditions. Therefore, the temperature humidity index (THI) was calculated based on the formula proposed by Mader et al. (2006) as follows:

 RH  THI = 0.8  Tdb + 100  (Tdb - 14.4) + 46.4
where, Tdb is the dry bulb temperature (캜), and RH is relative humidity (%).
The categories for THI were defined as: THI < 75 = normal; 75  THI  78 = alert; 78 > THI  83 = danger, and THI > 83 = emergency.
The THI is a single value that represents the combined effects of air temperature and relative humidity. Limitations to this index are that there is no reference to air movement or solar radiation; also, it does not consider management and animal factors. Heat load index (HLI) was developed by Gaughan et al. (2008), and considered the factors mentioned above. This index was calculated as follows:
The HLI calculation requires the black globe temperature (BGT) in 캜, inferred from temperature and solar radiation measurements:
 BGT = 1.33  Tdb - 2.65  Tdb + 3.21  log (SR + 1) 3.5

where, Tdb is defined as above, log is the logarithm function (base 10), and SR is solar radiation in Wm-2. Then, if:
  < 25, HLIlow = 1.3  BGT + 0.28  RH - WS + 10.66 BGT = + e2x5p, (2H.4L-IhigWh S=) +1.585.62BGT + 0.38  RH - 0.5  WS

where, RH is defined as above, and WS is the wind speed in ms-1. A blending function S(BGT) is needed to compute the final HLI:

1

S(BGT) = 1 + exp

- BGT-25

2.25

HLI = S (BGT)  HLIhigh + (1 - S (BGT))  HLIlow
Finally, HLI values smaller than 50 were set to 50. Whether cattle recover or become stressed depends on the value of certain thresholds. The first threshold occurs at an HLI value of 77. For HLI values below 77, the cattle cool

down and recover. The second or upper threshold depends on the type and condition of the cattle and their pen environment; its value ranges from about 80 for unacclimatized (and possibly compromised) black Angus cattle to about 95 for acclimatized Brahman cattle. The range of HLI values between 77 and the upper threshold is called the thermoneutral zone. For this zone, cattle neither recover nor become stressed. In the current research study, an upper threshold of 86 (for unshaded black B. taurus) as the basis was established based on Gaughan et al. (2008) and adjusted +4 for genotype (25% B. taurus - 75% Bos indicus); thus, the upper threshold was set at 90. Based on that: HLI < 77 = cooling; 77  HLI  90 = thermoneutral; and HLI > 90 = danger.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed as a randomized incomplete block design with a 3  2  4 factorial arrangement utilizing pen as the experimental unit and year as the block. Data were analyzed with the MIXED procedure of SAS(SAS Institute Inc. 2020), with cattle initial weight grouping, greenhouse roof use, season as fixed effects, and year as a random effect. Pairwise comparisons between the least square means were computed using the pairwise differences (PDIFF) option of the least squares means (LSMEANS) statement. Differences were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05. The following statistical model was fitted to the three response variables analyzed:
yijklm =  + Wi + Rj + Sk + Yl + (WR)ij + (WS)ik
+ (RS)jk + (WRS)ijk + eijklm
where: yijklm: each of the response variables analyzed (DMI, ADG,
and G:F); : Overall mean; Wi: Fixed effect of the ith initial weight grouping (i = light,
medium, heavy); Rj: Fixed effect of the jth roof condition category on the
feedlot (j = with, without greenhouse roof); Sk: Fixed effect of the kth season of the year at the start of
the fattening cycle (k = spring, summer, fall, winter); Yl: Random effect of the lth year at the start of the fattening
cycle (l = 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019) ~normally, identically and independently distributed data (NIID) (0, Y2 );
(WR)ij: Interaction of the ith initial weight grouping with the jth roof condition
(WS)ik: Interaction of the ith initial weight grouping with the kth season of the year
(RS)jk: Interaction of the jth roof condition with the kth season of the year
(WRS)ijk: Interaction of the ith initial weight grouping with the jth roof condition, and with the kth season of the year
eijklm: residual ~NIID (0, e2) There were 24 treatment combinations (3  2  4) and 1,062 total observations (closeouts of pens). The number on observations per year of data collection was 283, 280, 250, and 249 for 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. On average, the number of replications per treatment combination was ~11; however, the number of replications was unequal with greater number of replications for medium and heavy cattle than for light cattle.

RESULTS
Figure 2 shows rainfall distribution from January 2016 to December 2019 in the region where the feedlot is located. In general, rain falls in this region from June to September. Across the years considered in the study, the annual rainfall ranged from 51.8 to 71.8 cm, with an average of 63.4 cm. Table 2 presents the yearly and monthly averages of temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, THI, and HLI. Average temperature by month ranged from 10.7 to 19.9 캜, with an average of 15.9 캜. Average relative humidity by month ranged from 45.2% to 80.2%, with an average of 64.1%. Average wind speed by month ranged from 0.6 to 6.9 m톝-1 with an average of 3.4 m톝-1. Finally, average solar radiation by month ranged from 174.4 to 271.4 W톗-2 with an average of 224.9 W톗-2.
Average THI by month ranged from 51.5 to 63.8, and the average across years considered in the study was 59.1, whereas average HLI by month ranged from 51.7 to 62.1 and the average across the years of the study was 56.7 (Table 2). Figure 3 shows estimates of THI (Figure 3a) and HLI (Figure 3b) every 10 min from January 2016 to December 2019. Looking into detail at the measurements every 10 min of 207,444 estimates of THI and HLI, only 30 and 21 of the estimates were classified into the alert and danger categories for THI and HLI, respectively.
The significance of interactions and main effects on the analyzed variables are reported in Table 3, and the least square means are presented in Table 4. There were cattle initial weight grouping and roof main effects for all variables (P < 0.01). Differences in DMI and ADG across all cattle

initial weight groups comparisons were statistically significant (P  0.01); as expected, closeouts of heavy cattle had the greatest DMI (10.41  0.06 kg톋nima-1톎-1) and ADG (1.70  0.01 kg톎-1); closeouts of light cattle had the lowest DMI (9.21  0.08 kg톋nimal-1톎-1) and ADG (1.58  0.01 kg톎-1); and the closeouts of medium cattle had an intermediate DMI (9.72  0.06 kg톋nimal-1톎-1) and ADG (1.68  0.01 kg톎-1). The G:F did not differ (P = 0.34) for closeouts of light and medium cattle (0.172  0.001 vs. 0.173  0.001), which had greater (P < 0.01) G:F than closeouts of heavy cattle (0.164  0.001).
Pens with greenhouse roofs had an important positive effect on the performance of beef cattle: closeouts of pens with greenhouse roof had decreased DMI (9.70  0.06 vs. 9.86  0.06 kg톋nimal-1톎-1), greater ADG (1.67  0.01 vs. 1.63  0.01 kg톎-1), and increased G:F (0.173  0.001 vs. 0.166  0.001) compared to closeouts of pens without the greenhouse roof (P < 0.01). Season of the year had a significant effect on DMI and G:F (P < 0.01). The highest DMI (10.02  0.07 kg톋nimal-1톎-1) was recorded for spring closeouts, and it was statistically different (P < 0.01) from closeouts of the remaining seasons of the year. DMI was not statistically different (P = 0.22) between autumn (9.60  0.07 kg톋nimal-1톎-1) and summer (9.69  0.08 kg톋nimal-1톎-1) closeouts, and those had the lowest values for DMI. Closeouts in winter had DMI (9.82  0.06 kg톋nimal-1톎-1) not different from closeouts in summer (P = 0.08), but greater (P < 0.01) than closeouts in autumn, and lower (P < 0.01) than closeouts in spring. The G:F did not differ (P  0.09) among summer, autumn, and winter closeouts (0.171  0.001, 0.172  0.001,

The three-way interactions were not significant (P > 0.51; Table 3); however, some of the two-way interactions were significant. There was no cattle initial weight grouping  season interaction for all variables (P > 0.39). There was no cattle initial weight grouping  roof interaction for DMI and ADG (P > 0.31), but there was an interaction (P = 0.03) for G:F. Closeouts of light and medium cattle with greenhouse roofs did not differ in G:F (0.178  0.001 vs. 0.176  0.001; P = 0.19); however, they have greater (P  0.01) G:F than all other combinations. Closeouts of heavy cattle with greenhouse roofs had greater (P  0.01) G:F than closeouts of heavy cattle reared without roofs but did not differ (P = 0.89) from closeouts of light cattle raised without a greenhouse roof. Closeouts of the light, medium, and heavy cattle reared without roofs differed in G:F among them (P  0.03), with medium cattle having the greatest, followed by light and then heavy cattle.
There was no roof  season interaction (P = 0.47) for DMI, but there were interactions for ADG and G:F (P < 0.01). Closeouts from cattle without greenhouse roofs did not differ in ADG (P > 0.14) across all seasons of the year among them. However, closeouts of spring with greenhouse roofs had greater ADG (1.70  0.01 kg톎-1) than closeouts of all other seasons and roof combinations (P < 0.03). As an illustration, the closest value to the spring-greenhouse roof combination for ADG, yet statistically smaller, was for the combination wintergreenhouse roof (1.68  0.01 kg톎-1), while the lowest value for ADG was for the combination spring-without greenhouse roof (1.61  0.01 kg톎-1). Closeouts of summer and autumn, either with or without greenhouse roofs, had an intermediate performance and did not differ among them in ADG (P > 0.09). However, summer and autumn closeouts with greenhouse roofs presented greater ADG (P < 0.02) than spring closeouts without greenhouse roofs. Closeouts of winter with greenhouse roofs outperformed (P < 0.02) the ADG of most of the combinations but had lower ADG than spring closeouts with greenhouse roofs (P < 0.03) and did not differ in ADG compared to summer closeouts with greenhouse roofs (P = 0.30).
Closeouts of spring without greenhouse roofs had less G:F than closeouts of the other seasons without greenhouse roofs (P < 0.01), which did not differ among them (P > 0.44). Closeouts of cattle raised with greenhouse roofs on all the seasons of the year were more efficient than cattle without greenhouse roofs on all seasons of the year (P < 0.04), excepting the comparison of winter-greenhouse roof vs. summer-without greenhouse roof, which were not different (P > 0.05). Closeouts of spring and summer with greenhouse roofs did not differ (P > 0.45) in G:F from closeouts of winter with greenhouse roofs.

DISCUSSION
Based on the findings of THI and HLI in this research study, heat stress most likely is not a problem in the region where the

feedlot subject of this research study is located. However, it is essential to highlight that the meteorological station was not located inside the feedlot, and because the feedlot can have a microclimate, this deserves future research. In contrast, it is imminent that the rainfall reached levels greater than 51 cm in that region and concentrated in only four months of the year, proving that muddy pens can be a problem if no actions are undertaken in this feedlot.

In regions with temperate weather, beef cattle in feedlots typically do not suffer heat or cold stress; however, rainy and windy conditions can create discomfort and reductions in performance. One of the main concerns of feedlots in central Mexico is the side effects of muddy pens, especially during the rainy season. Muddy pens can reduce productivity, increase morbidity and mortality, producing significant economic losses and animal welfare concerns. Using greenhouse roofs is a strategy to provide a more comfortable environment and avoid productivity losses. Beef cattle producers have adopted

this innovation during the last decade in Central Mexico. Pens are constructed with greenhouse roofs covering the entire pen, protecting cattle from rain, wind, and direct solar radiation.
In addition to benefits mentioned above, a greenhouse roof has the following advantages: prefabricated light structures, easy transportation with a minimum time of installation, low cost of installation and maintenance, easy replacement of damaged parts, appropriate natural ventilation and lighting, safe, sanitary conditions, and easy cleaning (NikitaMartzopoulou, 2007).
The flexibility of the greenhouse roofs has spread its use in feedlots even in hot environments where one can think its use can be counterproductive; however, in combination with technologies such as mechanical ventilation, they can benefit the performance of beef cattle. For example, Castro-Prez et al. (2020) investigated effects of shade allocation and shade plus fan (mechanical ventilation) on growth performance, dietary energy utilization, and carcass characteristics. The latter study was done in a region with tropical weather and included limited shade, 1.2 or 2.4 m2톋nimal-1 provided with a galvanized metal sheet; and total shade, which was equivalent to 9 m2톋nimal-1 provided with greenhouse roofs (high-density polyethylene canvas) either with or without mechanical ventilation provided by fans (3 fans톚en-1) 24 h per day. Average daily THI was 80.9  2.1 and increasing the shade allocation tended to linearly increase ADG (1.15, 1.19, and 1.20 kg톎-1 for 1.2, 2.4 or 9 m2톋nimal-1, respectively) and

had a quadratic effect on DMI (7.06, 7.59, and 7.49 kg톎-1 for 1.2, 2.4 or 9 m2톋nimal-1, respectively). Although, no significant effect (P  0.33) of shade was observed on G:F. The use of mechanical ventilation improved ADG (1.20 vs. 1.32. kg톎-1) and G:F (0.162 vs. 0.175), whereas it did not have a significant effect on DMI.
Muhamad et al. (1983) studied the effect of the starting season (summer vs. winter) and housing (an open lot with or without overhead shelter) on the performance of beef cattle in Iowa, US. These authors found no differences between summer and winter for DMI and efficiency (expressed as feed conversion ratio) in agreement with the current study's findings; however, ADG was greater for cattle placed on feed in summer (1.12  0.05 kg톎-1) than cattle placed on feed in winter (1.05  0.05 kg톎-1) that contrasts with the current study's results because ADG was not different across seasons in our study. Furthermore, in contrast to the current study's results, the Muhamad et al. (1983) housing system did not affect DMI, ADG, and feed efficiency.
Pusillo et al. (1991) studied the effect of starting month and housing (an open lot with or without overhead shelter) on beef cattle performance over five years in the Midwest of the US. The latter authors reported cattle started on feed in spring have 11% more DMI than cattle started on feed in autumn, which had the lowest DMI. In the current study, closeouts of cattle initiated on feed in spring had 4.4% more DMI than closeouts of cattle with the lowest DMI, started on feed in autumn; therefore, their results agree with the current study's results in the effect of the season, although with different magnitude. In contrast, Pusillo et al. (1991) reported cattle with access to overhead shelter had 2.6% greater DMI than cattle without overhead shelter. In the current study, closeouts of cattle raised with the greenhouse roofs had a 1.6% reduction in DMI compared to those of cattle reared without the greenhouse roofs, and ADG was not affected by the year's season; however, Pusillo et al. (1991) published an advantage for cattle started on fed in May versus November of 37%. Feed efficiency was better for closeouts of summer, autumn, and winter than for closeouts of spring in the current study. A different pattern was observed by Pusillo et al. (1991), as cattle were more efficient (feed efficiency expressed as feed conversion ratio) when placed on feed in spring and summer than in autumn and winter.
Concerning housing system, Pusillo et al. (1991) stated that across months, cattle with shelter had greater ADG (7%) and efficiency (4%-5%) than cattle without shelter (P < 0.05); these findings agree with the current study's results of cattle reared under greenhouse roofs had an increase of 2.4% in ADG and of 4.2% in G:F. Differences between Pusillo et al. (1991) and the study can be explained by differences in housing systems and weather conditions. For instance, the notable difference in ADG across months reported by these authors can be due to moderate-severe cold stress combined with rain and snow affecting the cattle started on feed in November in the US Midwest. In addition, a month  housing interaction existed in their study, suggesting shelter enhanced ADG and feed efficiency when cattle started the feeding in autumn or winter because of colder environmental conditions in that region. During spring and summer, ADG and feed efficiency were not improved due to the availability of overhead shelters.
Koknaroglu et al. (2005) investigated the effect of housing (an open lot with or without overhead shelter), the initial

weight of cattle (the cattle classification by weights was similar to the one in the current study), and seasons, which were defined as in the current study. The data was collected from feedlots located in Iowa, USA. The annual average temperature was 8.3 캜, with a minimum of -26 캜 in winter and a maximum of 38 캜 in summer. The annual rainfall was 81.3 cm; thus, unpaved pens were very muddy during spring and autumn. Contrary to the current study, an interaction initial weight grouping  season existed for ADG, DMI, and feed efficiency, cattle placed on feed in spring and reared in pens with overhead shelter did not differ in ADG and feed efficiency from cattle raised in pens without overhead shelter. These discrepancies are most likely attributable to differences in the housing systems and more significant differences in weather across seasons. Though not measured, it is possible that cattle in Iowa experienced heat or cold stress. In parallel to our results, Koknaroglu et al. (2005) found cattle started on feed during spring and reared in pens with overhead shelter had greater ADG than cattle started on feed in autumn. Also, cattle were more efficient in pens with shelter than in pens without shelter independently of initial weight grouping.
In a study undertaken in an arid region in Mexico, also evaluating the effect of pens with greenhouse roofs on finishing performance of beef cattle, Valadez-Noriega et al. (2019) reported decreased DMI (13.4  1.3 vs. 14.5  0.8 kg톋nimal-1톎-1), greater ADG (1.9  0.1 vs. 1.8  0.1 kg톎-1) and better feed efficiency expressed as feed conversion ratio (6.9  0.9 vs. 7.9  0.4) for pens constructed with greenhouse roofs in contrast with pens built without the greenhouse roofs. In the current study, the more prominent advantages (greater ADG and G:F) of using pens with greenhouse roofs were presented for spring closeouts, proving importance of keeping cattle comfortable, clean, and dry during the rainy season. Cattle that started the feeding cycle during spring were fed during spring and summer; thus, these cattle were fed during the month of increased rains.
According to Morrison et al. (1970), muddy pens can reduce ADG and feed efficiency by 35% and 25%. Rayburn and Fox (1990) estimated a reduction in cattle feed efficiency of approximately 8% for every 4 cm of accumulated mud. Thomas (2013) reported mud over 30 cm in pens decreased feed efficiency of beef cattle by 25% and Sweeten et al. (2014) stated 11 to 20 cm of mud decreased feed efficiency by 13%. In the current study, the increase in feed efficiency was 4.2% for pen closeouts with greenhouse roofs compared with closeouts of pens without greenhouse roofs; these differences could be explained because in the current study, mud level in the pens without a greenhouse roof never reached those accumulation levels due to the feedlot having a good cleaning calendar. Pens were cleaned as soon as they accumulate approximately 5 cm of mud; however, it is essential to highlight pens constructed with a greenhouse roof yielded benefits even with good management.
Across cattle initial weight groups, feed efficiency was improved in pens with greenhouse roofs, with the most significant advantage for light cattle; therefore, providing more comfortable conditions is even more crucial for light cattle, which are usually at greater risk than medium and heavy cattle. Furthermore, pens with greenhouse roofs provided more prominent advantages for ADG and G:F when cattle started the fattening cycle in spring, which means that pens with greenhouse roofs offer a much better environment than

its counterpart during the months of greater rainfall in central Mexico, allowing maintaining clean and dry cattle.
Effects of the protection provided by greenhouse roofs in pens can be attributable to a better microclimate that favors animal welfare and performance. For example, in regions with temperate weather and annual rainfall over 51 cm, providing protection with greenhouse roofs in feedlots generates a microclimate that protects cattle against extreme temperature variation and the adverse effects of rain, such as mud, resulting in increased ADG and G:F; therefore, the feeding period could be shorter and profitability larger. It is also important to highlight that using cost-effective technologies as greenhouse roofs that improve feed efficiency can lead to more sustainable beef production in challenging environments.
CONCLUSIONS
The adoption of pens with greenhouse roofs in feedlots located in temperate weather favors the productivity and efficiency of beef cattle, providing an alternative for more sustainable production systems. At the same time, it advantages animal welfare due to a more comfortable environment for the animals. More substantial benefits are provided for light cattle and fattening cycles that are undertaken during months of increased rainfall.

Abstract
BACKGROUND It is relatively rare for schwannomas to invade bone, but it is very rare for a large mass to form concurrently in the paravertebral region. Surgical resection is the only effective treatment. Because of the extensive tumor involvement and the many important surrounding structures, the tumor needs to be fully exposed. Most of the tumors are completely removed by posterior combined open-heart surgery to relieve spinal cord compression, restore the stability of the spine and maximize the recovery of nerve and spinal cord function. The main objective of this article is to present a schwannoma that had invaded the T5 and T6 vertebral bodies and formed a large paravertebral mass with simultaneous invasion of the spinal canal and compression of the spinal cord.
CASE SUMMARY A 40-year-old female suffered from intermittent chest and back pain for 8 years. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans showed a paravertebral tumor of approximately 86 mm  109 mm  116 mm, where the adjacent T5 and T6 vertebral bodies were invaded by the tumor, the right intervertebral foramen was enlarged, and the tumor had invaded the spinal canal to compress the thoracic medulla. The preoperative puncture biopsy diagnosed a

benign schwannoma. Complete resection of the tumor was achieved by a two-step operation. In the first step, the thoracic surgeon adopted a lateral approach to separate the thoracic tumor from the lung. In the second step, a spine surgeon performed a posterior midline approach to dissect the tumor from the vertebral junction through removal of the tumor from the posterior side and further resection of the entire T5 and T6 vertebral bodies. The large bone defect was reconstructed with titanium mesh, and the posterior root arch was nail-fixed. Due to the large amount of intraoperative bleeding, we performed tumor angioembolization before surgery to reduce and avoid large intraoperative bleeding. The postoperative diagnosis of benign schwannoma was confirmed by histochemical examination. There was no sign of tumor recurrence or spinal instability during the 2-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION Giant schwannoma is uncommon. In this case, a complete surgical resection of a giant thoracic nerve sheath tumor that invaded part of the vertebral body and compressed the spinal cord was safe and effective.

INTRODUCTION
Schwannoma, also called Schwann cell tumor, The main sites of disease are the relatively superficial areas of the head and neck, trunk and extremities. The spine is also the most common clinical site, accounting for approximately 25% of spinal tumors. The tumor is usually located in the epidural area and rarely invades the subdural area along the nerve roots. It forms a "dumbbell" growth with intervertebral foramen expansion and oppression of adjacent bone and is often accompanied by hardened zone formation. The boundary is relatively clear, and tumor growth is relatively slow[1,2]. The main symptom is segmental pain.
Literature research found that due to the lack of sensitivity to radiation and chemotherapy, removal of the tumors completely is key to achieve a good treatment outcome. A good surgical treatment outcome is related to the choice of surgical approach and good prognosis after surgical treatment of the disease; there is less recurrence after complete resection, and the chance of malignancy is small[3]. However, there is no unified surgical approach standard for spinal schwannoma at present, especially for large schwannoma and the defect reconstruction following the removal of schwannoma. We recently successfully treated a patient with giant schwannoma. The main purpose of this paper is to report a case of large thoracic schwannoma treated by thoracic surgeons and spinal surgeons in combination in order to provide reference for clinical treatment.

CASE PRESENTATION
Chief complaints
A 40-year-old female suffered from intermittent chest and back pain for 8 years.
History of present illness
Intermittent chest and back pain discomfort for 8 years.
History of past illness
She reported that her chest and back pain had progressively worsened over the past 8 years but was not taken seriously.
Personal and family history
There was nothing special in her medical history, and she had no family history of the disease.
Physical examination
The specialist examination revealed right chest and back tenderness and percussion pain. Skin sensation was significantly reduced below the umbilical level. The muscle strength of both lower limbs was weakened, and the muscle tension was slightly increased. The bilateral hoffman sign was negative, while the babinski reflex was positive. The bilateral knee tendon reflex was hyperactive. Other physical examinations were normal.
Laboratory examinations
The results of routine blood tests and biochemical tests were normal. The pathological findings from other hospitals included (from tissue of a right lung puncture biopsy) soft tissue tumor, considered to be neurogenic, with relatively active focal cell proliferation, not excluding malignant potential. Immunohistochemical results: cytokeratin (-), vimentin (+), smooth muscle antibody (-), S-100 (+), Desmin (-), Ki67 (hot spot 10%), Bcl-2 (+), CD117 (-), discovered on gastrointestinal stromal tumors 1 (-), WT-1 plasma (+), and Calretinin (-). Given the aforementioned details, the preoperative diagnosis was benign schwannoma.
Imaging examinations
X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans revealed that the bone shapes of T5 and T6 were irregular, with an irregular soft tissue density shadow inside, protruding into the thoracic cavity on the right side, approximately 87 mm  93 mm  121 mm, with an uneven internal density, where the CT value was approximately 12-35 HU. Bone destruction was seen in the vertebral bodies and right adnexa as well as part of the right ribs (Figure 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the spinal canal and paravertebral space were occupied at the level of T5-6 vertebral bodies. They were irregular and had slightly longer T1-weighted (T1W) and T2-weighted (T2W) signals in the vertebral bodies with unclear boundaries. The right intervertebral foramen in the corresponding area was enlarged, adjacent bone was absorbed, the lesion extended to the right intervertebral foramen, invading the right paravertebral area, and grew to the right thoracic cavity, with a size of 86 mm  109 mm  116 mm. There were multiple round long T1W and T2W signals in the lesion in the right thoracic region. Lesions can be seen as patchy hyperintensity in diffusion-weighted imaging. The enhanced scan showed inhomogeneous enhancement with unenhanced areas. The MRI in Figures 2-6 shows the right pleural fluid.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS
The final diagnosis is schwannoma.

TREATMENT
Surgical treatment was performed by a combination of thoracic surgeons and spine surgeons. First, the thoracic surgeon removed the chest tumor as follows: the patient was placed in the right lateral position, a linear incision of approximately 20 cm long

Figure 1 Axial computed tomography revealed bone destruction visible in the T5 (A) and T6 (B) vertebrae and the right accessory and
part of the right rib, and irregular soft tissue density shadows were seen in the T5 and T6 vertebrae, which protruded into the thoracic
cavity to the right.
was made on the posterior and lateral sides of the 5th rib, the subcutaneous muscles were incised layer by layer, and the chest cavity was on one-lung ventilation. The surface of the tumor is rich in blood supply, and the lesion is extensive, with adhesions to the middle lobe, lower lobe and diaphragm. Therefore, gradual blunt separation of the lesion from the lower lobe and diaphragm was performed. Because part of the middle lobe tissue could not be separated from the lesion, a wedge-shaped piece of lung tissue was removed along with the lesion, and a disposable linear cutter was used to suture the surface of the lesion. Thus, the lesion was completely removed in the thoracic cavity except for the spinal side. The thoracic cavity was then flushed, and the anesthesiologist was instructed to aspirate and blow the lung. A chest drain was left in the 7th intercostal space in the mid-axillary line, and the chest was closed. Intraoperative bleeding was approximately 150 mL.
In the next step, the patient was placed in the prone position, and the spine surgeon continued the operation. A central posterior median incision was made at T5-6, approximately 30 cm in length, and the paravertebral muscles were separated layer by layer to reveal the T2-9 spinous process, bilateral laminae, upper and lower articular processes, and the outer edges of the joints. After drilling the arch channel at T2-9 (except for the left side T5-6 and right side T4-7) with good fluoroscopy, a vertebral arch screw was screwed in, the 5th-7th intercostal nerve and blood vessels were ligated, and the bilateral 5th, 6th and 7th ribs next to the spine were occluded, especially the bilateral 6th rib (occluded for nearly 6 cm). These steps allowed the pleural tissue to be separated from the thoracic tumor so that the tumor could be removed. A pre-curved suitable longitudinal connecting rod was then placed in the left arch screw and fixed. After this, the paravertebral tissues were separated after occluding the T5 and T6 spinous processes and the vertebral plates, the segmental vessels were ligated, the dural sac and nerve roots were exposed, the T4/5 and T6/7 intervertebral discs were removed, and the T5 and T6 vertebral bodies were completely removed after scraping out the cartilage endplates. The removed spinal tumor and vertebral bodies were sent for pathological examination. Next, titanium mesh reconstruction and a posterior pedicle nailing system were performed, and the transverse beam was connected between T3/4 and T7/8 bilaterally. Reinforced fixation was performed. After physiological saline irrigation, vancomycin was left in the incision to prevent infection, the closed pleural cavity and spinal area drainage were left in place, and the incision was closed layer by layer. Intraoperative bleeding was approximately 800 mL. Intraoperative blood transfusion was 1000 mL.

OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
The pathological result reported the presence of a spindle mesenchymal tumor cell (right thoracic canal and T5-6 vertebral body). In combination with the immunohistochemical staining results, this supported cellular schwannomas with active cell proliferation and vertebral tissue destruction. Immunohistochemical staining results were as follows: S-100 (+), SOX10 (+), Ki67 (positive rate 10%), synaptophysin (partial +), Neurofilament (-), smooth muscle antibody (-), Desmin (-), CD34 (-), CD117 (-), and discovered on gastrointestinal stromal tumors 1 (-).

up, the patient was in good condition, and no recurrence was observed. Postoperatively, the patient was observed in the hospital for 2 wk without complications and was discharged with instructions to rest for 3 mo, wear a neck and chest brace and move around moderately to avoid trauma. Half a year after surgery, the Visual Analog Scale score decreased from 6 to 1, and the sf-36 score also significantly increased after surgery (Table 1).

DISCUSSION
Schwannoma is the most common benign tumor of the spinal canal[4]. Although large schwannoma is unusual, it clinically often occupies two to three vertebral canal segments due to its slow tumor growth. In the early stages, it does not have an obvious symptom because the tumor biological characteristics develop over time alongside expansive tumor growth, after which the symptoms present as oppressive nerve, spinal cord and nerve root pain, paresthesia, movement disorders and other symptoms. CT, MRI and other auxiliary examinations are often used to diagnose schwannomas inside and outside the spinal canal. Surgical resection of the tumor should be performed at an early stage when pathological fracture and instability of the spine may occur or when compression of vital organs and severe symptoms may occur. Since schwannomas are insensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, surgical resection is also the main treatment for intraspinal extramedullary schwannomas, and radical complete resection of schwannomas is the gold standard for the treatment of this disease[2,5,6]. Surgical treatment can be performed to remove the tumor, relieve compression and restore the stability of the spine to improve the symptoms of patients, improve the quality of life and prevent recurrence[4].

In the study there was a heated discussion regarding the surgical approach of complete as well as incomplete resection, which is mainly due to the consideration of spinal stability[1], preservation of neurological function and controversy over the recurrence of nerve sheath tumors[7]. For locally invasive benign tumors, complete resection is recommended because there is a risk of recurrence without complete removal of the tumor. In contrast, incomplete resection has been adopted by some scholars when the tumor grows in the lumbar spine[8,9], due to the consideration that removal of the tumor may sacrifice the nerve roots of its corresponding segment. They believe that not all nerve roots are invaded by the tumor and many exist in the "adherent" cases[10], so they do not remove the nerve root when removing tumors to avoid causing neurological deficits and believe that the few patients with neurological deficits mostly belong to other conditions such as nerve contusions. Some scholars think that tumors are not completely removed to avoid damage to the nerves and spinal cord[2], and only a very small percentage of patients require secondary surgery for tumor growth during long-term follow-up. Even in the literature[11,12], it was found that the recurrence rate is low, which does not mean that it does not occur. Therefore, doctors should fully inform patients and families to be prepared for all

aspects of multiple surgeries when they are facing this type of disease. For example, some surgeries are too difficult and too challenging to try to remove the entire tumor completely within a single surgery, and incomplete resection cases tend to increase the chances of recurrence[13].
For the cases of giant schwannoma of the thoracic vertebra with bone destruction, due to the tumor invasion T5 and T6 that can be seen from imaging, the tumor destruction of vertebral bodies was extremely serious because it considerably affected the stability of the spine. In this case, it was not possible to remove completely the tumor via surgery with a single posterior approach. Thus, we used the joint operation method to treat this disease for the radical removal of the tumor and the invaded vertebral tissue. Vertebrae T5 and T6 were excised, and posterior fixation with a long segment pedicle screw system was performed by titanium mesh filling and artificial vertebral body implantation.
Since the destruction of spinal stability by this type of surgery is often devastating, the requirement for reconstruction is significantly higher than that of patients with degeneration and trauma. To prevent recurrence of the disease and to avoid the risk of physical injury and economic burden to the patients and their families, the tumor should be removed as thoroughly as possible through radical resection, while long segment posterior fixation should be performed to try to restore the stability of the spine[14]. Since the blood supply of the tumor surface capsule is relatively rich and the blood supply of the tumor is mainly concentrated at the input and output of the nerve bundle[15], special attention should be given to avoid destroying the capsule during surgery; otherwise, intractable bleeding may occur.
We suggest for these giant schwannomas that we can perform tumor angioembolization before surgery to reduce and avoid large intraoperative bleeding. Postoperative patients should rest for 3 mo, wear neck and chest braces, and perform moderate ground activities to avoid fatigue and other conditions.
CONCLUSION
Giant invasive spinal schwannomas are rare lesions, but their local aggressiveness and expansion in all directions can lead to bone destruction and tissue adhesion. Therefore, surgical planning is particularly important. This case proves that the removal of giant thoracic schwannomas is feasible through one-stage surgery through excision of the diseased tissue as standard and complete as possible. The surgical treatment of schwannomas is likely to have a good outcome, with a low rate of recurrence, a good prognosis and few malignant changes.

Purpose: The Upper Limb Physician's Rating Scale (ULPRS) is a tool that assesses movement quality of the upper limbs. It is used as an outcome measure after botulinum toxin type A injection in children with cerebral palsy (CP). This study aimed to investigate the reliability and validity of the ULPRS in children with spastic CP. Materials and Methods: Thirty children with spastic CP (M:F=17:13) aged 5 to 13 years old were recruited. The ULPRS was scored based on recorded videotapes by four physicians on two separate occasions. The Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function (MUUL) was scored by an occupational therapist. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), 95% confidence intervals and weighted kappa statistics were calculated for the scores of ULPRS to obtain interrater and intrarater reliability. The relationship between ULPRS and MUUL was assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients. Results: The ICCs for the total ULPRS scores were 0.94 between raters and 0.99 to 1.00 within raters. The weighted kappa statistics for subitem scores for the ULPRS ranged from 0.67 to 1.00 within raters and from 0.46 to 0.86 between raters. The relationship between ULPRS and MUUL was strong (Pearson correlation coefficient=0.751; p<0.05). Conclusion: The results demonstrated the high reliability of the total ULPRS score within and between raters. A significant concurrent validity between ULPRS and MUUL also supports the clinical utility of the ULPRS as an outcome measure of spastic upper limb in children with CP.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common neurologic disorder that causes chronic motor disability in children.1 The majority of CP cases are of the spastic type, and the upper limb is commonly involved. Spasticity has been considered a main contributor to both impairment of function and the development of deformity. Thus, reduction of spasticity plays an important role in managing children with spastic CP. Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) injection into spastic upper limb muscles has been widely used as an adjunct to conventional therapeutic techniques as a means of reducing muscle spasticity and improving function in the affected arm.2 A reduction of muscle

tone, changes in movement pattern, and also an improvement in upper limb function following BoNT-A injection has been described using various outcome measures.3-7
The Upper Limb Physician's Rating Scale (ULPRS) is a semi-quantitative modification of the Lower Limb Physician's Rating Scale. It was designed to assess changes in the movement pattern, focusing on all 3 levels of the arm (palm, forearm, and elbow) to determine whether there is an isolated functional impairment, such as thumb in palm, restricted forearm supination, or a total flexion pattern with thumb in palm, wrist in flexion, forearm supinated, and elbow flexed (Supplementary Table 1, only online).2,8,9
The ULPRS has been recommended by previous studies as an outcome measure to assess functional measures and changes in the movement pattern following BoNT-A injection.2,8,10 The merits of ULPRS are its ease of use in measuring spasticity and speed of assessment by a variety of health care providers without special training. Thus, it may be suitable as an outcome measure for periodic assessments in a busy office setting. However, the reliability and validity of ULPRS have not yet been investigated.
The Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function (MUUL) is a reliable and valid tool for measuring the quality of upper limb movement in children aged 5 to 15 years with cerebral palsy.11,12 It is widely used to examine the effectiveness of specific therapeutic interventions. In addition, it was considered the best measure of unimanual capacity in a systematic review article.13 However, to our knowledge, there is no information about the relationship between ULPRS and MUUL. We hypothesized that the ULPRS would be a reliable clinical test for assessing upper limb function in children with CP. Therefore, the aims of this study were: 1) to evaluate the intrarater and interrater reli-

ability of the ULPRS in children with spastic cerebral palsy and 2) to examine the concurrent validity of the ULPRS by investigating its relationship with the MUUL.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants Thirty children with spastic CP (M:F=17:13) were recruited. The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) is widely used to assess the gross motor function in children with CP, and the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) was developed to evaluate a child's typical manual performance in daily life.14,15 GMFCS and MACS levels of the participants and the distributions of sex, age, and involvement are shown in Table 1.
Ethical approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee of Severance Hospital (#42012-0265). Because all of the children in this study were younger than 18 years, informed consent was obtained from the parents of the children for their participation in the study.
Measurements All of the children were videotaped so that physicians could assess the ULPRS of the upper arm while specific tasks were performed. One physician gave instructions and demonstrated the movements while the other physician recorded the videotape. The scoring of the ULPRS from the videotape was completed by 4 physicians on 2 separate occasions with a time interval of at least one week. The score sheet includes 9 items, and 3-, 4-, and 5-point scales are used to score each component of movement tested.
The MUUL for the affected or more severely affected upper limb was scored by one occupational therapist.
Statistical analysis Missing values on items scores were handled in the analysis as follows: 1) for single-item summaries of reliability, participants with missing values were omitted, and 2) for analysis based on total scores, mean substitution was used so that for each child, their total score was equal to the average on the non-missing items rescaled to the total number of items recorded.
The intrarater and interrater reliability of the total ULPRS scores were examined using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs, based on a two-way random effects model with absolute agreement). To calculate interrater and intrarater re-

liability of the subitems of the ULPRS (ordinal data), we used linearly weighted kappa statistics. ICCs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using SPSS software 19.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The goal of this analysis was to describe the relative homogeneity of the scores with data sets16 and to indicate the degree of agreement between ratings provided by multiple raters.17 Measures from trials 1 and 2 for each rater were compared to determine intrarater reliability. Trial 1 for each rater was used to assess interrater reliability. To further examine reliability, the correlation coefficients were used to calculate the standard error of measurement (SEM), which was calculated on the basis of inter-value differences and standard deviation. The SEMs were calculated for the ULPRS by using the following formula: SEM%=SD(1-ICC)(1/mean) 100.17 The consistency of measurements between occasions for the total ULPRS score for each physician was examined using the method of Bland and Altman.18
Interpretation of the ICCs was as follows: values above 0.80 were considered very high, between 0.60 and 0.79 were moderately high, between 0.40 and 0.59 were moderate, and less than 0.40 were low.19 There were no absolute criteria for acceptable reliability; however, ICCs greater than 0.7 were considered reliable for sample-based research.20
According to the guidelines of Landis and Koch,21 kappa values of more than 0.80 were considered excellent, between 0.61 and 0.80 were substantial, between 0.40 and 0.60 were moderate, and less than 0.40 were poor to fair.
To examine the concurrent validity of ULPRS, the relationship between the total ULPRS and MUUL scores was tested using the Pearson correlation coefficient.
RESULTS
The mean ULPRS scores performed by four physicians on two different occasions, the ULPRS score at each reading and the mean score for the MUUL are listed in Table 2. There were no missing values among the data.
The ICCs for the total ULPRS scores were 0.94 between raters and 0.99 to 1.00 within raters, indicating very high

interrater and intrarater reliability (Table 3). The weighted kappa statistics for ULPRS subitem scores
ranged from 0.67 to 1.00 within raters. The k values for intrarater reliability were excellent except for subitems of finger opening, thumb in palm, and associated increase in muscle tone for Rater 3, and active supination in flexion and extension for Rater 4. On the other hand, weighted kappa statistics for subitems of ULPRS ranged from 0.46 to 0.86 between raters. The k values between raters were excellent for only 1 subitem and substantial for 4 ULPRS subitems (Table 4). Fig. 1 displays the differences in the total ULPRS scores between occasions for each rater. The means and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) between occasions were 0.031.54 for Rater 1, -0.033.37 for Rater 2, -0.132.79 for Rater 3, and 0.031.54 for Rater 4. As shown in Fig. 1, there were no obvious outliers.
The relationship between the ULPRS and MUUL was strong (Pearson correlation coefficient=0.751; p<0.05).

children with CP, such as the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST),22 the MUUL,11 the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA)23 and the Shriners Hospital Upper Extremity Evaluation (SHUEE),24 which differ in terms of which aspect of upper limb function and which age range they target. Therefore, clinicians may select an upper limb measurement tool to assess a specific aspect of upper limb function. The reliability and validity of an assessment tool is important in effectively measuring the outcomes of a specific therapeutic intervention. In addition, convenience and ease

of administration are crucial for periodic assessments. The ULPRS is a simple tool for assessing the quality of movement and function that can be performed by a variety of health care providers, and its ease of application can be useful in a busy clinical setting. In our study, the ICCs of the total ULPRS score were over 0.9 for both intrarater and interrater reliability, which indicates strong reliability of the total ULPRS score. As far as we know, this is the first study to investigate the reliability of the ULPRS. The ICCs for interrater and intrarater reliability of the total ULPRS score in

our study are compatible with those of QUEST and MUUL in the literature, which are commonly used to assess upper arm function for children with CP.11,22,25
As for the intrarater reliability of the ULPRS item scores, the weighted kappa statistics were overall excellent except for 3 subitems for Rater 3 and 2 subitems for Rater 4. On the other hand, the interrater reliability for ULPRS subitems varied from excellent to moderate agreement. In addition, there were no obvious outliers on the Bland-Altman plot, which was narrow. The LOA indicated that the agreement was strong, with the 95% LOA range within 3.37 on a 47-point scale. These findings suggest that differences in the ULPRS of more than 3.37 after intervention when performed by the same rater may reflect a true change in function as a result of therapeutic intervention.
The ICCs for each item of the ULPRS are in accordance with the reliability of each score on the MUUL in previous studies, where the ICCs varied from low to high (ranging from 0.37 to 0.91).26,27 Some reports demonstrated that the reliability of the scores on each item of the MUUL were acceptable for all items except items 1 and 2.11,26 In contrast, only 9 of 16 items of the MUUL achieved ICCs over 0.7 in Spirtos, et al.'s27 report. Although the reason for this significant difference was not clear, differences in the severity of the subjects' cerebral palsy have been suggested as a possible reason in the Spirtos study. In our study, the weighted kappa statistics for only 4 of 9 items were greater than 0.7. The elbow flexors, pronators, and wrist flexors are commonly targeted for spastic upper limb management with BoNT-A injection,10 and thus, our results indicate that changes in movement patterns after BoNT-A injection into those muscles may be reliably measured with the ULPRS. However, ICCs for the five remaining items on the ULPRS were not adequate for clinical use; therefore, scoring guidelines for clarifying differences between individual scoring criteria are needed.
The MUUL is based on 16 items comprising of tasks that are representative of the most important components of unilateral upper limb function (reach, grasp, release, and manipulation).28 The test is administered by a therapist, with a video recording of the child's performance obtained for subsequent scoring. The reliability and validity of the MUUL has been well-established in previous studies.12,26,27 According to a recent systematic review article, MUUL is the best scale to measure unimanual functional changes as a result of spasticity management.13 Therefore, the validity of the ULPRS was assessed in relation to the MUUL. The signifi-

cant positive correlation between total ULPRS and MUUL scores in our study indicates that the two scales may be comparable.
According to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), upper limb function can be measured based on body impairment, activity, and participation levels. The MUUL is a tool for assessing the activity level of ICF, whereas the ULPRS has components representing impairment levels of ICF in addition to activity levels. Differences in the way components of ICF were measured may have contributed to the weaker relationship between the ULPRS and MUUL.
Changes in movement pattern and quality after BoNT-A injection are of interest to clinicians involved in the management of spastic upper limbs. From this perspective, the ULPRS may have unique clinical value and thus is often used as an outcome measure following BoNT-A injection in the literature.2,8,10 The acceptable reliability, reproducibility, and also validity of the ULPRS demonstrated in our study support the clinical use of the ULPRS as an upper arm measure for children with spastic CP following BoNT-A injection into spastic upper limb muscles.
Videotaped evaluation of upper extremity function has several advantages as well as certain disadvantages. One advantage is the ability to observe the same performance several times to capture movement quality more accurately. On the other hand, the procedure is time-consuming, and scoring from video clips using the ULPRS may be difficult depending on the angle of the video. Therefore, intrarater and interrater reliability from videotaped performances of upper extremity function in children with CP may differ from reliability measured live. Comparison of reliability between live and video observation is needed.
In addition, the ULPRS originally aimed to measure postintervention changes; however, therapeutic interventions were not involved in our study, the effectiveness of the ULPRS in this situation was not examined. Further study is needed to demonstrate the validity of measuring post-intervention changes.
Our study demonstrated high ICC values within and between raters for the total ULPRS score and also a strong relationship between the ULPRS and MUUL. These findings support the clinical utility of ULPRS as an outcome measure after spastic management of the upper limb. However, k values for subitem scores within and between raters varied from excellent to moderate agreements. Further efforts are required to provide scoring guidelines that clarify the differ-

ABSTRACT
Her2-neu overexpression has a pathogenetic, therapeutic and a controversial prognostic role in gastric cancer. p-53 mutation status and Ki-67 proliferation index are established prognostic markers in many tumors. In this study we evaluated p-53 and Ki-67 in relation to Her2-neu positive and negative gastric adenocarcinoma (GA). This cross-sectional study was carried out at King Fahd Hospital of Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University. Fifty cases of GA were retrieved from pathology archives. Clinico-pathological parameters were evaluated. Immunohistochemical protein analysis for Her2-neu, Ki-67 and p-53 was carried out. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was done for Her2-neu positive cases showing 2+ immunoexpression. Frequency of Ki-67 and p-53 positivity in Her2-neu positive cases was calculated and compared with those in Her2-neu negative cases. Correlation of clinicopatological parameters with Her2 positive and negative cases, p-53 mutation status and Ki-67 proliferation index was carried out. Her2-neu overexpression was present in 12% (n = 6) cases. A high Ki-67 was seen predominantly in Her2-neu positive cases (83%, n = 5). Her2-neu negative cases (n = 44) showed moderate (31.88%, n = 14) to low (34%, n = 15) Ki-67. Diffuse p-53 positivity was seen predominantly in Her2-neu positive cases (33.33%, n = 2). Focal p-53 was seen mainly in Her2-neu negative cases 56.8% (n = 25). Negative p-53 was seen to be independent of Her2-neu status. Her2-neu positivity is strongly associated with diffuse p-53 mutation status and high Ki-67 proliferation. Her 2-neu negative status is associated with focal p-53 positivity and low to moderate Ki-67 proliferation index. Such stratifications in prognostic markers could not only be predictive in patient's prognostics but could also form a basis of molecular classification of gastric cancer.

1. Introduction
Gastric cancer is one of the most common and aggressive malignant tumors worldwide with a high mortality rate, preceded only by lung cancer [1]. Globally gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer related mortality with a 5-year overall survival rate less than 25% [2].
Her2-neu overexpression has a pathogenetic, therapeutic and prognostic role in gastric cancer. Evaluation of Her2-neu overexpression for targeted therapies is currently the mainstay treatment strategy [3]. Her2-neu as a negative prognostic parameter has established a strong foot holds in breast cancer. The ToGA trial (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer) attributed a similar status to Her2-neu in gastric cancer, yet no unanimous consensus has evolved so far in this regards till now [4,5]. Prognostic factors defined for the staging and therapeutic interventions in gastric cancer are imprecise as patients with similar parameters actually prove to be at different levels clinically, attributing a controversial prognostic status to Her2-neu overexpressivity [6].

Ki-67 and p-53 are established prognostic markers in many tumors. Ki-67 is a useful predictive and prognostic marker in cancers with a proliferation index exceeding 10%-14% delineating a high-risk prognostic category [7]. A pre-chemotherapy evaluation of rate of Ki-67 is also a strong predictor of efficacy of the therapy [8]. p-53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer with a critical role in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression. In gastric lesions, an increasing frequency of p-53 mutations is seen in H.pylori infection, a key player in gastric carcinogenesis, intestinal metaplasia, gastric dysplasia and gastric carcinoma [9]. Its expression is associated with advanced staged gastric carcinomas with a poorer postoperative prognosis.
In this study p-53 and Ki-67 were assessed in Her2-neu positive and negative gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) with an idea to find an association between Her2-neu status and these prognostic markers that could segregate a subset of more aggressive GA, requiring a tailored, separate and aggressive therapeutic approach.

2. Material and methods

This cross sectional study was carried out at Pathology Department of King Fahd Hospital of Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University in 2015-2016. Approval of the protocol was granted by the Institutional Review Board.
A sample size of 45 (one sample implies a biopsy specimen from an individual patient) from was calculated for a study population (registered patients) of 10,000, using a confidence level of 95%, margin of error of 5% and response rate of 3%, based on cancer incidence report for gastric cancer of Saudi Arabia2010 [10]. This sample was drawn from pathology archives of the department, and comprised gastric carcinoma resection specimens and endoscopic biopsies over a period of 10 years preceding the study.
The inclusion criteria were availability of complete patient record, representative paraffin blocks, and sufficient tissue material to perform the required histopatholgical procedures. A total of 55 cases were selected initially on the assumption that some cases might not qualify on selection criteria at the time of tissue processing and staining. However we succeeded to get 50 qualifying samples, therefore we reported out of 50 instead of 45.
GA were histologically classified according to Laurens [11] which divides GA into two types; intestinal (consisting of well-formed tubules) and diffuse (diffuse tumor infiltration without well-formed tubules, frequently with signet ring cells).
Immunohistochemical staining using the labeled streptavidin-biotin method with 3,3-diaminobenzidine as a chromagen was performed for Her2-neu, p-53 and Ki-67 on 4 탆 thick paraffin sections cut from conventional blocks. Prediluted antibodies were used. Her-2 neu(clone CB11), Ki-67(clone MIB-1)) and p-53(clone DO-7) were obtained from Ventanna, Dako and Navacastro respectively. The staining was performed concurrently in a Ventana Benchmark automated immunostainer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ventana Medical Systems Inc., Strasbourg, France). The immunostained sections were examined under a light microscope and evaluated manually by both the authors. Any interpretational discrepancies were resolved under a double-headed microscope.
A modified scoring system for GA that has been shown to be predictive in a large Phase III ToGA trial was used for Her2-neu expression in gastric cancer [12]. The 10% cut-off rule was kept in resection specimen, whereas in biopsies any group of at least five tumor cells showing distinct membranous staining (typically lateral at cell-cell junctions) was considered specific. The Microscope Magnification rule was applied to determine Her2-neu expression.
Demonstration of distinct intercellular membranous staining whether linear, basolateral or ring-shaped was

required. If a strong intensity could be seen at 2.5-5 magnification it was designated a score of 3 + . A visible weak to moderate staining at 10-20 was scored as 2 +, barely visible staining at 20-40 was scored as 1+ and a negative staining was given a score of 0. A score of 2+ and 3+ was considered as Her2-neu positive (overexpression). While the scores of 0 and 1+ were regarded as Her2-neu negative [12]. The unequivocal cases (Her2neu 2+) were confirmed by FISH analysis.
FISH for HER2 gene amplification was conducted on FFPE of gastric tumor according to the protocol of FDA approved kit from Abbott. The probes consist of a dual color, two probe mixture of DNA sequences on specific regions of chromosome 17, including the centromere of chromosome 17 (CEP17) and the Her2 gene region at chromosome 17q12. Signals were visualized under a Zeiss Axioskop microscope (Zeiss, Germany) using a FITC/Rhodamine dual band filter. We followed the ASCO criteria for analyzing the results. The guidelines stated that Her2/CEP17 ratio <2 is considered a normal result, 2 is considered an amplified abnormal result.
Ki-67 and p-53 were done for both Her2-neu positive and negative cases. Frequency of Ki-67 and p-53 were compared between Her2-neu positive and negative cases and statistical significance was determined.
Ki-67 expression was defined as the presence of nuclear staining. The percentage of cells expressing Ki-67 was determined by counting 1000 cells/slide. The percentage of positive cells was scored as follows: less than 10% = low proliferative activity, 10%-40% = moderate proliferative activity and more than 40% = high proliferative activity [13].
p-53 mutation status was defined as positive in presence of nuclear staining. Cytoplasmic staining was considered negative. Tumors were considered focally positive when unequivocal staining was present in 10%-50% of tumor cells and as diffusely positive when more than 50% of the tumor cells were positive [9].
Data was entered into SPSS (version 19). Descriptive statistics were used to calculate frequencies (percentages) for expression of Her2-neu, Ki-67 proliferation index and p-53 mutation status. Frequency of Ki-67 and p-53 positivity was compared between Her-2neu positive and negative cases using Chi square test. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
3. Results
Out of a total of 50 cases of gastric cancer retrieved, 43 specimens were biopsies and 7 were partial gastrectomies. Male to female ratio was 37:13 and median age of the patients was 67 years (maximum & minimum 88 & 42 years). Diffuse type gastric cancer was seen in 23 (46%) and intestinal type in 27 (54%) of cases. The clinicopathological parameters are presented in

A moderate Ki-67 was seen in 16.66% (n = 1) of Her2-neu positive cases as compared 31.88% (n = 14) in Her2-neu negative cases. (Moderate Ki-67 was significantly high P value 0.01, in Her2 neu negative cases). (Table 7)

4. Discussion
Gastric cancer is not one disease entity but a complex combination of multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations. Marked variation in the prognosis of patients with GA within a similar pathological stage requires the identification of subgroups of patients with a more aggressive disease.
In this study an overall estimation of Her2-neu overexpression, p-53 mutation status and Ki-67 proliferation index in GA along with evaluation of p-53 and Ki-67 in Her2-neu positive and Her2-neu negative GA was evaluated.
Overall in this study there was a cumulative 12% of Her-2neu over expressivity with 8% showing 2+ and 4% demonstrating 3+ immunoreactivity (Figure 1(a,b)). Her2-neu over expression in GA has been reported to range from 11.7% [14] to 23% [15] in different studies. Only some studies have documented Her2-neu protein overexpression or gene amplification to be associated

with a worse prognosis [16] however larger studies could not confirm this as an independent prognostic factor [17,18]. Her2-neu prognostic significance is further minimized by its reported loss in approximately one third of patients when treated with trastuzumab, leading to drug resistance. Additionally with advanced aggressive Her2-neu positive tumors, other genetic alterations involving specifically p-53 (92%) and other cell-cycle mediators supervene [19]. These data suggest the need for periodic Her2-neu status evaluation during therapy but also incorporation and monitoring of other cell cycle regulators such as p-53 from the start so as to have a baseline level available for further patient evaluation.
In gastric carcinomas, p-53 expression frequency has been reported to vary from 46% [20] to 61% [21].In our set of cases, with a total of 72% of cases revealing focal to diffuse p-53 expression (Figure 1(e,f)), a somewhat higher representation is seen. Out of this Her2-neu positive cases predominantly showed diffuse p-53 positivity (33.33%) while Her2-neu negative cases (56.81%) revealed mostly focal p-53 positivity. Negative p-53 expression was seen irrespective of Her2-neu status. This stratification of p-53 and Her2-neu expression pattern has not been reported before. p-53 mutation is the most common genetic alterations in human cancer initiation and progression and has been reported to be an independent prognostic factor in patient's overall and disease-free survival in gastric cancer [22]. A stratified expression was seen in our cases with increase from focal in Her2-neu negative to diffuse in Her2-neu positive cases. Could this point out toward a direct genetic link between these two entities with both increasing concomitantly and being codependent and not independent factors?
Therapeutically this link could be important as currently anti-p53 therapies [23] are in stages of development. Addition of these to anti-Her2-neu drugs such as traztuzumab might improve patients' clinical outcome that has been so poor till now.
Based on the above discussion Her2-neu and p-53 cases can be categorized into two groups. One set of Her2-neu positive cases that retain p-53 expression but lose their Her2-neu co- expression and when cancer becomes advanced. This set will be the ones that will be facing traztuzumab resistance. Addition of anti-p53 might be helpful to some extent. The other set can be the ones that have conjoined expression of Her2-neu and diffuse p-53. A double therapy targeting both could be beneficial to these patients. More extensive studies unravelling these facts at genetic and clinical levels need to be carried out.
In our study an overall high to moderate Ki-67 proliferating index was seen in 70% of cases. A range of 70%- 76% has been reported in other studies [24,25]. Ki-67 is a nuclear protein that is expressed in proliferating cells throughout the cell cycle. In a meta-analysis comprising

a total of 5600 gastric cancer patients from 29 studies, it was concluded that a high Ki-67 expression could serve as a predictive biomarker for poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients [26]. The value of Ki-67 becomes more marked if it is seen in conjunction with Her2-neu positivity. An association between Her2-neu overexpression, Ki67 proliferation index and a high grade and stage has been reported [27]. In our study 83% of Her2-neu positive cases showed a high Ki-67 proliferation index (Figure 1(b, c)). Her-2 neu negative cases revealed mainly moderate to low Ki-67. Hence Ki-67 expression increases with Her2neu overexpression. Could it be that the concept of Her2neu gene working as an independent prognostic marker needs to be reevaluated? At the genetic level Her2-neu and Ki-67 maybe partners that express collectively in high grade advanced gastric carcinomas. The protein expression of Ki-67 and Her-2neu has overlapping features in the clinical pathologic characteristics of gastric cancer. Ki67 is strongly linked to gastric cancer differentiation, infiltration and lymphatic spread, whereas Her-2 neu plays a role at the level of tumor differentiation and nodal metastasis [28]. Stratification of cases by Her2-neu status and extent of Ki-67 expression could be a very useful tool for selection of specific therapies as Ki-67 as a molecular target for anticarcinogenic therapies is being explored [29].
A more advanced gastric cancer genetic profiling needs to be determined with formulation of molecular classification of gastric cancer as is currently being done in breast cancer. This will pave the way for individualized targeted treatment options based on gastric cancer molecular characteristics that could improve the patient's prognostics that have been so dismal till now.
5. Conclusion
Her2-neu positivity is strongly associated with diffuse p-53 mutation status and high Ki-67 proliferation. Her 2-neu negative status is associated with focal p-53 positivity and low to moderate Ki-67 proliferation index. This strong association in Her2-neu positive cases could be the basis of a separate molecular subset of gastric carcinoma, a potential candidate for separate tailored molecular therapeutic regimens.
