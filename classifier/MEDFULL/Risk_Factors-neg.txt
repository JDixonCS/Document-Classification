ABSTRACT
Background Although endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) features and criteria have been described in chronic pancreatitis, challenges remain with interoperator variability and ease of adoption. The aim of this study was to define and validate the EUS features of chronic pancreatitis in a multicenter prospective study in Asia. Method The study was divided into two parts: the first part was conducted to derive the EUS features of chronic pancreatitis with adequate interoperator agreement; the second was to prospectively evaluate these features in a multicenter cross-sectional study and determine the optimal combination of features for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. Prospectively enrolled cases had standard internationally validated radiologic or histologic features of chronic pancreatitis, and controls were patients without chronic pancreatitis who underwent EUS examination. Results The top six EUS features that had good interobserver agreement (mean kappa 0.73, range 0.60 - 0.90) were selected to be further evaluated in part II of the study. These included: hyperechoic foci with shadowing, lobularity with honeycombing, cysts, dilated main pancreatic duct, dilated side branches, and calculi in the main pancreatic duct. A total of 284 subjects (132 cases, 152 controls) were enrolled from 12 centers in Asia. All six features had high accuracy ranging from 63.3 % to 89.1 %. Two or more of these six EUS features accurately defined chronic pancreatitis (sensitivity 94.7 %, specificity 98.0 %), with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.986. Conclusion This multicenter Asian study characterized and defined the EUS features of chronic pancreatitis. This provides a useful tool in clinical practice and further research in pancreatic cancer surveillance.

Introduction
Chronic pancreatitis is defined by chronic, progressive pancreatic inflammation and scarring that irreversibly damages the pancreas and results in loss of exocrine and endocrine function [1]. As a condition of heterogeneous etiology [2], varying clinical presentations, and considerable differences in the clinical course, the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis remains challenging. Various imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), are available to aid in imaging the structural and morphologic changes in chronic pancreatitis. International consensus guidelines have proposed an algorithmic approach to patients with clinical presentations suspicious for chronic pancreatitis [3].
EUS has particular utility in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis [4] as it can detect subtle pancreatic parenchymal and ductal changes, before even external cross-sectional imaging [5],

and is considered the most sensitive test to diagnose the early stage of the disease [3]. One of the challenges in the use of EUS in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is that some of the pathognomonic features identified may also be seen in other common conditions, such as obesity and diabetes [6], as well as being related to aging [7]. Furthermore, considerable variation in morphology in chronic pancreatitis limits the specificity of any one endosonographic feature.
To address some of the heterogeneity, expert consensus standard criteria have been derived, the most commonly used being the Rosemont criteria [8]. Challenges remain with the utility and performance of these criteria in clinical cohorts [9]. The major drawback of the Rosemont criteria is their considerable interoperator variability [10, 11]. In addition, the optimal number of criteria required for a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis remains unclear [12]. Furthermore, many of the diagnostic criteria were derived solely in Western populations, and some differences in chronic pancreatitis patterns and pathology

among Asians have been suggested [13], hence there is a need to review these criteria in a multinational Asian context. It is also important to evaluate and clarify these criteria in a realworld scenario.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate and prospectively validate EUS criteria for chronic pancreatitis in a multicenter cohort of Asian patients with the aim of deriving a set of criteria that have less interoperator variability and improved clinical utility.
Methods
The study was divided into two parts: the first part was conducted to derive the EUS features of chronic pancreatitis with adequate interoperator agreement; the second was to prospectively evaluate these features in a multicenter cross-sectional study and determine the optimal combination of features for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.
Part I - selecting endosonographic features with good interobserver variability
A set of 17 EUS video clips were retrospectively recorded and edited in standardized format to demonstrate the EUS stations for the evaluation of the pancreas (stomach, duodenal bulb, and second part of the duodenum) and include endosonographic evaluation of the parenchymal and ductal features of the entire pancreas. Fifteen of these videos were obtained from Asian patients who were investigated for suspected chronic pancreatitis, and two were from Asian patients with a normal pancreas. The video clips were chosen for quality and clarity, and were anonymized and made available for online review and scoring.
A panel of experienced endosonographers from across Asia were invited to examine the videos at a live session, being blinded to the patient status and evaluating for the presence or absence of 11 features of chronic pancreatitis, based on lit-

erature review: hyperechoic foci with shadowing, non-shadowing hyperechoic foci, strands, lobularity with non-contiguous lobules, lobularity with honeycombing, cysts, dilated main pancreatic ducts (measured on the EUS video), irregular pancreatic duct contour, hyperechoic pancreatic duct wall, dilated pancreatic duct side branches, and calculi in the main pancreatic duct [8, 14 - 18]. Standardized definitions of these features were further defined for clarity ( Table 1) and selected illustrative images were also provided ( Fig. 1).
Endosonographers were asked to independently score each video, marking if these features were present or absent. Interobserver agreement in recognizing the various diagnostic EUS features was determined by computing the kappa statistic, as described by Landis and Koch [19]. A perfect interobserver reliability is denoted by a kappa of 1, while values > 0.80 denote excellent reliability, 0.80 - 0.60 good reliability, 0.59 - 0.40 fair reliability, and < 0.40 poor reliability. Prior to the study, the participating endosonographers were trained to recognize these features with eight EUS training videos (six of chronic pancreatitis and two of normal pancreas).
For the purpose of this study, the six best performing features with good interobserver agreement and with kappa values of at least 0.6 were then selected to be included in the validation in part II of the study.
Part II - validation of the selected endosonographic features
A multicenter study was conducted prospectively to independently validate the use of these EUS features, with a cross-sectional design [20] being used to enroll subjects, both cases as well as normal controls.
Trained endosonographers at participating centers across Asia were acquainted in the use of a preliminary set of criteria comprising six selected diagnostic EUS features of chronic pancreatitis.

 Fig. 1 Endoscopic ultrasound imaging showing: a,b calcification in the pancreatic parenchyma (arrow) casting a shadow, consistent with hyperechoic foci with shadowing; c,d homogenous areas (arrow) separated by hyperechoic strands, consistent with lobularity with honeycombing; e an anechoic lesion (arrow) within the pancreatic parenchyma, consistent with a cyst; f,g a tortuous and dilated pancreatic duct (arrow); h a dilated side branch (arrow) joining the main pancreatic duct, in this case with calculi within; i,j hyperechoic lesions (arrow) with acoustic shadowing within the main pancreatic duct, consistent with calculi.

Firstly, eight de-identified EUS training videos (six of chronic pancreatitis and two of normal pancreas) were constructed. Each center study lead then enrolled experienced endosonographers and reviewed the eight selected videos with them to ensure standardization of the endosonographic features. A check-back process was implemented where the same eight videos (with diagnostic features identified and labelled) was presented back to the endosonographers and competency in recognizing all six diagnostic EUS features was confirmed prior to study participation.
Participating endosonographers then enrolled cases of chronic pancreatitis and normal controls in each of their cen-

ters. For each EUS, the presence or absence of the previously derived six diagnostic EUS features was recorded.
As a quality-control measure, all EUS procedural videos were recorded and the de-identified set of EUS videos was subsequently assessed by an expert review committee (from a different study center) for verification of these features.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria Chronic pancreatitis cases
To be included as a chronic pancreatitis case for this study, subjects had to have had a definitive diagnosis of chronic pancrea-

titis satisfying either reference criteria (i), (ii), or (iii) listed below (tabulated in Table 1 s, see online-only Supplementary material):
(i) definitive imaging findings characteristic of chronic pancreatitis on CT/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), as per the American Pancreatic Association [18]
(ii) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) findings characteristic of chronic pancreatitis, as per the Japanese Pancreatic Society [17]
(iii) definitive histological findings characteristic of chronic pancreatitis, as per the Japanese Pancreatic Society [17].
Normal pancreas controls Subjects with normal pancreas based on CT, MRI, and/or ERCP were recruited as controls. These subjects had to have no hepatobiliary disease, including pancreatitis. Other exclusion criteria included diabetes mellitus, a history of heavy alcohol use, family history of pancreatic disease, and history of gallstone or renal stone disease. They underwent EUS because of non-hepatopancreatobiliary indications, such as evaluation of subepithelial lesions and mediastinal masses.
An online secure clinical database was established for data coordination. Each study center enrolled subjects on this database, with the presence of each of the six features being recorded, together with patient demographics and characteristics.
Outcome measures
The study outcome measures included the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the use of the six EUS criteria for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in the multicenter Asian population. Both positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were assessed and the performance of the combination of factors was evaluated.
Ethics
The study was endorsed by the individual center's ethics review committee, as well as the National Health Group Domain Specific Review Board (NHG DSRB 2014/01271-AMD0005) from Singapore.
Statistical methods
For the sample size calculation for Part I of the study, we determined at least 21 experts were needed to each rate at least 17 videos, following methods described for statistical calculations described by Walter et al [21]. For Part II, we estimated for a difference in risk factor prevalence of 0.2 from existing data, we would need to enroll at least 62 cases and 62 controls for a power of 0.8 with a type I error probability of 0.05. Using multiple centers allowed these numbers to be accrued over a shorter period of time.
All data were collated from the individual study centers. Categorical variables were assessed using chi-squared tests. All data were analyzed in SPSS Statistics, version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA)

Results
For Part I, a total of 21 expert endosonographers from Asia participated in the study. Six respondents completed ratings of only some of the videos and were therefore excluded, leaving 15 who rated the 17 EUS imaging videos of the pancreas for the 11 internationally used diagnostic EUS features of chronic pancreatitis, as described in  Table 1. The respondents, who comprised experts from Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, among others, had a mean experience of 1913 EUS procedures.
The overall interobserver agreement on the presence/absence of the 11 diagnostic EUS features of chronic pancreatitis was below expectation (kappa value 0.54, range 0.14 - 0.90). The results of the interobserver agreement for the individual features are shown in  Table 2. There was no significant difference in interobserver reliability between respondents with more (completed > 1000 procedures) and less (completed < 1000 procedures) experience in the use of EUS (P = 0.56).
Considerable heterogeneity between observers was noted for some of the EUS features, for example hyperechoic duct wall had an interobserver agreement coefficient of 0.135. However, of the 11 EUS features included in the study, they were six diagnostic EUS features that were more consistently recognized by the participating endosonographers, with a combined kappa value for these six features of 0.73, and individual kappa values ranging from 0.60 to 0.90. Two criteria (lobulation with honeycombing and pancreatic duct irregularity) had a kappa of 0.60, but given the prior decision to select six criteria, lobulation with honeycombing was chosen because pancreatic duct irregularity would have overlapped somewhat with dilated main pancreatic duct. These six EUS features with good interobserver agreement were used to form a preliminary set of diagnostic criteria and included: hyperechoic foci with shadowing, lobular-

For Part II, 284 subjects (132 cases, 152 controls) were enrolled from 12 centers. The subjects' ethnic origins were: Indian 112 (39.4 %), Japanese 62 (21.8 %), Chinese 42 (14.8 %), Malay 4 (1.4 %), and other 64 (22.5 %). There were 60.9 % men in this cohort. Age was recorded in bands ( < 18y, 18 - 30y, 31 - 50y and > 50y); the median age group was 51 years and above, with there being participants in all age groups. Compared with the control group, the chronic pancreatitis group tended to be younger, with 55.3 % below 50 years of age compared with 36.2 % below 50 years of age among the controls (P < 0.002). There was also a significant association with male sex among the cases, with 79.5 % of the cases being men compared with 44.7 % in the control group (P < 0.001). For the chronic pancreatitis subjects, 66.7 % had a history of ethanol use, 55.6 % smoking, and 53.3 % had additional hepatobiliary diseases.
Most of the case subjects had a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis based on CT (80.0 %) and/or MRI criteria (57.8 %). The exact distribution of these modalities (CT, MRI, ERCP, or pathology) among the cases is illustrated in Fig. 1 s.
The individual performance characteristics of each of the six selected diagnostic EUS features: hyperechoic foci with shadowing, lobularity with honeycombing, cysts, dilated main pancreatic duct, dilated side branches, and calculi in the main pancreatic duct are shown in  Table 3. All six features were shown to be useful in distinguishing cases from controls, with accuracy ranging from 63.4 % to 89.1 %. Using the receiver operating curve (ROC), two or more of these six EUS features accurately defined chronic pancreatitis (sensitivity 94.7 %, specificity 98.0 %), with an area under the curve (AUROC) of 0.986 ( Fig. 2). Table 2 s summarizes the proposed Asian EUS Group (AEG) criteria for chronic pancreatitis.

Discussion
Although EUS features have been described in chronic pancreatitis, interoperator agreement remains a challenge for the EUS diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis [20]. There is also a wide variation among operators in the type and number of features required for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. For instance, a questionnaire survey of 21 EUS experts from 10 countries in Asia found a divergence of opinion about the type and number of features required for a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis [22].

The survey also found a tendency towards overdiagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, based on the currently used Rosemont and International EUS criteria for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. In the survey, nine experts (42.5 %) reported observing at least one abnormal feature in asymptomatic pancreatic EUS examinations, while six experts (28.5 %) reported observing up to three abnormal features during examinations of the pancreas in asymptomatic individuals [22]. It is against this background of issues that this study aimed to address the EUS diagnostic features of chronic pancreatitis.
To address the issue of interobserver variability in the use of EUS features to diagnose chronic pancreatitis, we asked a group of Asian EUS experts to select features with good interobserver agreement, which were then validated in a multicenter crosssectional study of Asian patients. This study design differs from previously published studies that either evaluated the interoperator agreement among many endosonographers in a cross-sectional design [8, 23, 24] or evaluated the utility of the EUS findings in a cohort, but with the interoperator agreement between only two or three endosonographers [10, 25].
To address the issue of ease of adoption of these EUS features, we used a two-part process to derive a set of six EUS criteria, for which a cutoff of two or more features corresponded to a sensitivity of 94.7 % and a specificity of 98.0 % in this cohort. Limiting the existing features to those with high agreement will make the assessment of chronic pancreatitis simple and easy to use, and is likely to improve the overall reproducibility, compared with the Rosemont criteria.
Diagnosing chronic pancreatitis is particularly important for the patient as this disease has implications in terms of quality of life, as well as serious long-term sequelae, such as pancreatic cancer. As chronic pancreatitis is a risk factor for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, there is a role for surveying this cohort of patients. In this regard, EUS may be a helpful surveillance modality, as it is thought to be the most reliable procedure for detecting malignancy.
There are several limitations in this study. Firstly, the crosssectional design of the study allows a higher proportion of chronic pancreatitis patients to be enrolled than would be found in typical EUS practice. This should not be an issue as the intent of this study was to investigate the diagnostic features of chronic pancreatitis, and not the prevalence of chronic pancreatitis.
Secondly, reflective of real-world experience, the control group was older than the chronic pancreatitis group. It could be argued that the age difference between the case and control groups may skew the interpretation, because age-related ductal and parenchymal changes might mimic those of chronic pancreatitis [7]. In the present study, however, despite the presence of a greater number of older patients in the control group, the AUROC for two or more features remains good at 0.986.
Thirdly, we did not include subjects with early chronic pancreatitis, where the subjects might have had subtle changes demonstrable only on EUS, before being demonstrable as CT or MRI changes [5]. Early chronic pancreatitis could not be addressed in this study as the definition used for the diagnosis of

chronic pancreatitis in this cross-sectional study was a combination of compatible clinical presentation and radiological features, which typically diagnoses more established chronic pancreatitis. Histology was not mandatory for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in this study as it is not practical to perform biopsies or surgery for patients with chronic pancreatitis without a clear indication. As there is no single gold standard for chronic pancreatitis, the present study chose to adopt a priori agreed definitions based on either imaging and/or histologic criteria. In any case, this might not be an issue, as the main focus of this study was interobserver agreement amongst the experts and the derivation of the best EUS features for adoption into the clinical practice. We hope that the EUS criteria proposed from this study will form the basis for further prospective evaluation vis a vis other imaging or histologic modalities and might have a future role in detecting early chronic pancreatitis.
Finally, it is well known that many imaging features of chronic pancreatitis are not pathognomonic of chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic cystic lesions, such as pseudocysts, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, or mucinous cystadenomas, may potentially be falsely labelled should there be other concomitant criteria. Furthermore, three of the features described above, dilated pancreatic duct, dilated side branches, and cysts, can also be found with an obstructing pancreatic mass lesion. However, this should not be an issue as the same imaging modality would be expected to pick up the mass lesion.
One other point of note is that EUS is thought to be more sensitive than CT and MRI in chronic pancreatitis, particularly in detecting early morphologic changes. However, these changes might also correspondingly have high interindividual variability. For instance, in our study, lobularity without shadowing had a low kappa of 0.22, but this finding could potentially precede lobularity with shadowing. On the other hand, having "standard" criteria that EUS operators disagree on would be a superfluous exercise. This reflects the clinical equipoise that many criteria face in balancing the need for a sensitive test and a reproducible one.
Patient selection remains a methodological limitation of this cross-sectional study, as it remains to be seen if these criteria hold true in a separate unselected population. However, these patients were drawn from the same patient population as we would expect an Asian EUS center to encounter.
This study has numerous strengths. First, a relatively large number of patients were enrolled prospectively from multiple centers in Asia. Second, to ensure stringent standardization of the criteria used, we conducted upfront standardization training of the experts, followed by recruitment of patients into this study. Third, a high number of endosonographers (n = 17) took part in the agreement, compared with other reported studies that have typically had between two or three observers participating in the study. Fourth, all EUS videos were recorded and later audited by an independent committee to ensure consistency with the reported features.
While there is some suggestion of racial heterogeneity in chronic pancreatitis [13, 26], there is a paucity of data to support the hypothesis that the endosonographic appearances between Asians and Caucasians differ significantly. Nevertheless,

it is noted that differences in ethnic origin exist between other reported interoperator agreements [10, 25] and those in this study. This could be related to differences in genetic risk factors, for example differences in the population prevalence of SPINK or CFTR mutations [27, 28].
In summary, this is the first multicenter Asian EUS study to provide a set of EUS features diagnostic of chronic pancreatitis that are relatively objective, reproducible, and simple to use. It is anticipated that these features will be helpful in clinical practice and further research.

Abstract Background: A meta-analysis was conducted to determine whether telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) rs2736098 polymorphism was related to the incidence of lung cancer. Methods: We systematically searched the following three electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), for relevant articles. Statistical analysis was performed using the odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Seven articles involving 3836 healthy controls and 3637 patients were included in this meta-analysis. TERT rs2736098 polymorphism was significantly related to lung cancer incidence (AA vs. GG: OR¼1.83, 95% CI¼1.58-2.12; AG vs. GG: OR¼1.21, 95% CI¼1.10-1.34; Dominant model: OR¼1.33, 95% CI¼1.22-1.46; Recessive model: OR¼1.66, 95% CI¼1.44-1.90). Moreover, this polymorphism was found to be correlated with the susceptibility to lung cancer when studies were stratified based on the sample size and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Conclusion: The present findings indicate that the TERT rs2736098 polymorphism may be a risk factor for the development of lung cancer.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the most prevalent malignant tumor, and it is the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality world-wide,1 with a 5-year survival rate remaining at 18% regardless of therapeutic progress.2 Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing the present burden of lung cancer. However, most patients with lung cancer are currently diagnosed at an advanced stage, and these patients are unlikely to be cured. Additionally, the precise cause of lung cancer remains unknown, although smoking might play a predominantly etiological role in lung cancer. Notably, less than 11% of chain smokers develop lung cancer, suggesting the vital effects of genetic factors in the carcinogenesis of lung cancer.3
Telomeres are unique structures at each end of a chromosome, and they consist of the TTAGGG repeat sequence. Functionally, telomeres are involved in maintaining chromosomal integrity via the protection of chromosome ends from endto-end fusions and DNA damage.4 However, telomeres with an aberrantly short length could destroy chromosomal stability, thereby causing carcinogenesis. Telomerase, or terminal transferase, is a reverse transcriptase enzyme that could catalyze the telomere synthesis reaction to extend to 30 end of chromosomal DNA. Defective telomerase activity has been widely reported in multiple human malignancies, and telomere length is inversely related to cancer morbidity and mortality.5 Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), the catalytic subunit of telomerase, maintains telomere stability.6
The TERT gene is localized on the short (p) arm of chromosome 5 at position 15.33 (5p15.33), and it is critically involved in maintaining telomere DNA length and tumorigenesis. TERT coding region mutations could influence telomere length and telomerase activity, further triggering

severe clinical manifestations, such as substantially elevated cancer morbidity.7 The TERT rs2736098 polymorphism, a synonymous coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 2 of TERT that is located on chromosome 5p15, has been demonstrated to be related to cancer risks.8
The relationship of TERT rs2736098 polymorphism to the lung cancer risk has been reported in various studies, but the outcomes have been controversial. Case- control studies with a relatively limited sample size might not comprehensively illustrate the complicated relationship because of inadequate statistical power. However, a meta-analysis is a helpful method to analyze complicated data from case-control studies. This meta-analysis was performed by retrieving all the available data, and it aimed to examine the relationship between TERT rs2736098 polymorphism and the lung cancer risk.
Materials and methods
Publication search
This study was conducted in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) checklist.9 Related studies were systemically collected from three electronic databases, including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), PubMed, and Embase, using the following keywords: "cancer" OR "tumor" combined with "telomerase reverse transcriptase" OR "TERT" OR "rs2736098" and "polymorphism" OR "variant" OR "gene". Studies in English that were published before December 10, 2019 were enrolled in this meta-analysis. Moreover, we manually searched the related references from the retrieved studies or reviews to comprehensively acquire all eligible studies.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) studies concentrating on the association of TERT rs2736098 polymorphism with the risk of lung cancer; (b) case-cohort or case-control studies; and (c) studies with available information for calculating genotype distribution. The exclusion criteria were as follows: studies without controls; reviews; and duplicated publications. Typically, only studies with complete data were enrolled if there were multiple overlapping or duplicated studies.
Data extraction
Two investigators independently reviewed all possible articles and subsequently performed data extraction. Discrepancies were discussed with a third investigator. The following relevant information was retrieved from each paper: first author's surname, country, ethnicity, publication year, total numbers of cases and controls, genotype distributions in all subjects, and the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) among healthy controls.
Quality evaluation. The authors assessed the methodological quality of each included article using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS).10 An ultimate score of six stars or more was considered to be a high-quality study.
Statistical analysis
Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to determine whether TERT rs2736098 polymorphism was related to the lung cancer risk via a homozygote comparison (AA vs. GG), a heterozygote comparison (AG vs. GG), a dominant model (AAþAG vs. GG), and a recessive model (AA vs. AGþGG) between groups. The I2 test was also used to determine the potential heterogeneity

among these articles. An I2 of >50% was suggestive of heterogeneity among studies and the random-effects model was used; otherwise, a fixed-effects model was used. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on the sample size and HWE. Sensitivity test was conducted by sequentially eliminating one study each time to investigate its effects on the pooled outcomes. The Begg's test was also performed to assess the underlying publication bias (p<0.05 indicated statistical difference). Finally, STATA version 12.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA) was used for statistical analysis.
Results
Characteristics of the included studies
Initially, 478 studies were collected from the following databases: Embase, PubMed, and CNKI. The title, abstract, and full-text was reviewed and screened, and seven eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis.11-16,18 The flow diagram of study selection was shown in Figure 1. The publication years of the included studies ranged from 2009 to 2017. Overall, there were 3836 healthy controls and 3637 lung cancer patients from the seven studies that were included in this meta-analysis. When stratified by sample size, the sample size of four articles was >1000 participants each including both patients and controls. The HWE test was performed on the genotype distribution of the controls in all the included studies, and all of them were within the HWE except for Xiao et al.18 The general features of the seven included studies are summarized in Table 1. The results of the quality assessment based on the NOS for case-control studies are shown in Table 1. The overall scores of the included studies ranged from six to seven stars. All studies were defined as high-quality.

Overall and subgroup analyses
The relationship between TERT rs2736098 polymorphism and lung cancer is summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2. The TERT rs2736098 polymorphism was significantly related to lung cancer risk (AA vs GG: OR¼1.83, 95%CI 1.58-2.12; AG vs. GG: OR¼1.21, 95%CI 1.10-1.34; Dominant model: OR¼1.33, 95%CI 1.22-1.46; Recessive model: OR¼1.66, 95% CI¼1.44-1.90). Subgroup analyses stratified by sample size and HWE also showed

a significant correlation. The TERT rs2736098 polymorphism was correlated with the lung cancer risk in studies with a sample size of >1000 and also in studies with a sample size of 1000 participants (Table 2). We further performed a sensitivity analysis to reveal the effects of each single paper on pooled OR outcomes, showing that no single article actually affected the pooled ORs, which indicated the stability of the outcomes (Figure 3).

Publication bias
The possible publication bias was examined by visualizing the funnel plot, which revealed that there was no publication bias (Figure 4), and this indicated the low publication bias in our meta-analysis in the overall population (AA vs. GG: t¼0.2; AG vs. GG: t¼0.2; Dominant model: t¼0.2; Recessive model: t¼0.2).
Discussion
Global cancer statistical data indicates that lung cancer is among the most common and lethal human cancers,19 with a complicated carcinogenesis mechanism. Air pollution and smoking are considered to be critical risk factors in lung cancer. In addition, to better understand the possible mechanism underlying lung cancer tumorigenesis, it is necessary to identify and further evaluate the relevant genetic variations. Over the past decade, several meta-analyses have revealed the relationship between TERT

rs2736098 polymorphism and cancer risk, and previous studies have shown that rs2736098 leads to the occurrence and development of cancer.20-22 However, there is no specific study on lung cancer. Thus, this meta-analysis was performed by including case-control studies to examine the above possible relationship of TERT rs2736098 polymorphism with the lung cancer risk.
In this meta-analysis that included seven case-control studies involving 3836 healthy controls and 3637 lung cancer patients, we comprehensively assessed the relationship between TERT rs2736098 polymorphism and lung cancer risk. The TERT rs2736098 polymorphism was significantly related to enhanced lung cancer risk in the overall population. When the sample size of the study was investigated, the TERT rs2736098 polymorphism was correlated with the lung cancer risk in studies with a sample size of >1000 and 1000 participants. Moreover, in consideration of

possible between-study heterogeneity that is caused by allelic distribution deviation from HWE, subgroup analysis that was conducted by restricting this meta-analysis to studies that were consistent with the HWE showed that our findings were reliable. Additionally, the publication bias was

assessed as well as the robustness of our outcomes using a sensitivity analysis.
The details of the mechanism that is involved in lung cancer remains to be further elucidated. Inter-gene and genetic- environmental interactions play vital roles in tumorigenesis, while single genetic

variations might present only a modest effect. Previous evidence has suggested that TERT rs2736098 and CLPTMlL rs401681 polymorphisms synergistically increase the lung cancer risk.12 Additionally, a previous study found a synergistic effect of the TERT rs2736098 polymorphism and smoking on the lung cancer

risk.10 Interaction between other risk factors and this polymorphism in lung cancer needs to be further studied.
There are some limitations in this study. First, some of the original data on the relevant risk factors were unavailable in the enrolled studies, which restricted the assessment of gene-gene and gene-environment

correlation. Second, all enrolled studies had a retrospective design, which might cause subject selection bias and further affect the reliability of the final outcomes. Finally, we only included published studies, but there are some relevant unpublished studies, which might cause a potential publication bias.
In summary, our findings indicate that the TERT rs2736098 polymorphism might be associated with the risk of developing lung cancer. Large-scale case-control studies are required to investigate the possible gene-gene and gene-environment interrelationships with the lung cancer risk.

Abstract Identifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit child sexual abuse (CSA) disclosures has the potential to facilitate earlier disclosures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and prevent further sexual victimization. Timely access to therapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA disclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon's literature review framework, 33 studies since 2000 were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and future research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to practice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke's guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (1) Disclosure is an iterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure models reflect a social-ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual, familial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there is a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have been made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knowledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of disclosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors. Barriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facilitators of CSA disclosure. Implications for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future research.

Introduction
Timely access to supportive and therapeutic resources for child sexual abuse (CSA) survivors can mitigate risk to the health and mental health well-being of children, youth, and adults. Identifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit CSA disclosures have the potential to facilitate earlier disclosures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and potentially prevent further sexual victimization. Increased knowledge on both the factors and the processes involved in CSA disclosures is timely when research continues to show high rates of delayed disclosures (Collin-Ve´zina, Sablonni, Palmer, & Milne, 2015; Crisma, Bascelli, Paci, & Romito, 2004; Easton, 2013; Goodman-Brown, Edelstein, Goodman, Jones, & Gordon, 2003; Hershkowitz, Lanes, & Lamb; 2007; Jonzon & Lindblad, 2004; McElvaney, 2015; Smith et al., 2000).
Incidence studies in the United States and Canada report decreasing CSA rates (Fallon et al., 2015; Finkelhor, Shattuck, Turner, & Hamby, 2014; Trocme´ et al., 2005, 2008), while at

the same time global trends from systematic reviews and metaanalyses have found concerning rates of CSA, with averages of 18-20% for females and of 8-10% for males (Pereda, Guilera, Forns, & Go´mez-Benito, 2009). The highest rates found for girls is in Australia (21.5%) and for boys in Africa (19.3%), with the lowest rates for both girls (11.3%) and boys (4.1%) reported in Asia (Stoltenborgh, van IJzendoorn, Euser, & Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2011). These findings point to the incongruence between the low number of official reports of

CSA to authorities and the high rates reported in prevalence studies. For example, a meta-analysis conducted by Stoltenborgh, van IJzendoorn, Euser, and Bakermans-Kranenburg (2011) combining estimations of CSA in 217 studies published between 1980 and 2008 revealed rates of CSA to be more than 30 times greater in studies relying on self-reports (127 in 1,000) than in official report inquiries, such as those based on data from child protection services and the police (4 in 1,000) (Jillian, Cotter, & Perreault, 2014; Statistics Canada 2013). In other words, while 1 out of 8 people retrospectively report having experienced CSA, official incidence estimates indicate only 1 per 250 children. In a survey of Swiss child services, Maier, Mohler-Kuo, Landholt, Schnyder, and Jud (2013) further found 2.68 cases per 1,000 of CSA disclosures, while in a recent comprehensive review McElvaney (2015) details the high prevalence of delayed, partial, and nondisclosures in childhood indicating a persistent trend toward withholding CSA disclosure.
It is our view that incidence statistics are likely an underestimation of CSA disclosures, and this drives the rationale for the current review. Given the persistence of delayed disclosures with research showing a large number of survivors only disclosing in adulthood (Collin-Ve´zina et al., 2015; Easton, 2013; Hunter, 2011; McElvaney, 2015; Smith et al., 2000), these issues should be a concern for practitioners, policy makers, and the general public (McElvaney, 2015). The longer disclosures are delayed, the longer individuals potentially live with serious negative effects and mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, trauma disorders, and addictions, without receiving necessary treatment. This also increases the likelihood of more victims falling prey to undetected offenders. Learning more about CSA disclosure factors and processes to help advance our knowledge base may help professionals to facilitate earlier disclosures.
Previous literature reviews examining factors influencing CSA disclosure have served the field well but are no longer current. Important contributions on CSA disclosures include Paine and Hansen's (2002) original review covering the literature largely from the premillennium era, followed by London, Bruck, Ceci, and Shuman's (2005) subsequent review, which may not have captured publications affected by "lag to print" delays so common in peer-reviewed journals. These reviews are now dated and therefore do not take into account the plethora of research that has been accumulated over the past 15 years. Other recent reviews exist but with distinct contributions on the dialogical relational processes of disclosure (Reitsema & Grietens, 2015), CSA disclosures in adulthood (Tener & Murphy, 2015), and delayed disclosures in childhood (McElvaney, 2015). This literature review differs by focusing on CSA disclosures in children, youth, and adults from childhood and into adulthood--over the life course.
Method
Kiteley and Stogdon's (2014) systematic review framework was utilized to establish what has been investigated in CSA

disclosure research, through various mixed methods, to highlight the most convincing findings that should be considered for future research, practice, and program planning. This review centered on the question: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to future research and practice? By way of clarification, the term systematic refers to a methodologically sound strategy for searching literature on studies for knowledge construction, in this case the CSA disclosure literature, rather than intervention studies. The years spanned for searching the literature were 2000-2016, building on previous reviews without a great deal of overlap. Retrieval of relevant research was done by searching international electronic databases: PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Educational Resources Information Center, Canadian Research Index, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress, Sociological Abstracts, Social Service Abstracts, and Applied Social Science Index and Abstracts. This review searched peerreviewed studies. A search of the gray literature (unpublished literature such as internal agency documents, government reports, etc.) was beyond the scope of this review because unpublished studies are not subjected to a peer-review process. Keyword search terms used were child sexual abuse, childhood sexual abuse, disclosure, and telling.
A search of the 9 databases produced 322 peer-reviewed articles. Selected search terms yielded 200 English publications, 1 French study, and 1 Portuguese review. The search was further refined by excluding studies focusing on forensic investigations, as these studies constitute a specialized legal focus on interview approaches and techniques. As well, papers that focused exclusively on rates and responses to CSA disclosure were excluded, as these are substantial areas unto themselves, exceeding the aims of the review question. Review articles were also excluded. Once the exclusion criteria were applied, the search results yielded 33 articles. These studies were subjected to a thematic analysis as described by Braun and Clarke (2006). This entailed (1) multiple readings by the three authors; (2) identifying patterns across studies by coding and charting specific features; (3) examining disclosure definitions used, sample characteristics, and measures utilized; and (4) major findings were extrapolated. Reading of the articles was initially conducted by the authors to identify general trends in a first level of analyses and then subsequently to identify themes through a deeper second-level analyses. A table of studies was generated and was continuously revised as the selection of studies was refined (see Table 1).
Key Findings
First-level analysis of the studies identified key study characteristics. Trends emerged around definitions of CSA disclosure, study designs, and sampling issues. First, in regard to definitions, the term "telling" is most frequently used in place of the term disclosure. In the absence of standardized questionnaires or disclosure instruments, telling emerges as a practical term more readily understood by study participants. Several

The majority of the men in the study waited until adulthood to disclose their abuse, with negative stereotypes contributing to their delayed disclosures. Negative stereotypes contributed to delayed disclosure with trying to forget. Breaking isolation was cited as a motivator to disclosure along with the aid of various forms of media on disclosure. Important contextual issues such as negative stereotyping of males, sexuality, and victims were noted. Social media was seen as a facilitator of disclosures
CSA onset was largely between the ages 5 and 9. No one ever talked to them about sex, so they didn't have language to disclose. Barriers: fear of family breakdown and removal, not wanting to tarnish the family's name, and fear of retribution by family members if they disclosed. Pattern of stifled and dismissed disclosures identified over the life course. All 17 participants identified spirituality as a primary source of strength throughout the life course
Three broad categories were identified as barriers to CSA disclosure: Barriers from within-internalized victim blaming, mechanisms to protect oneself, and immature development at time of abuse; barriers in relation to others--violence and dysfunction in the family, power dynamics, awareness of the impact of telling, and fragile social network; barriers in relation to the social world labeling, taboo of sexuality, lack of services available, and culture or time period.
Disclosure increased with the age of the victim: if penetration had occurred, if the victim was related to the offender, if the victim was not living with the offender at

One of few studies to focus exclusively on African American women. Small but sufficient size for a qualitative inquiry. Important cultural and contextual issues were brought forward. Retrospective study that may have been affected by recall issues. Use of a life-course perspective as a theoretical lens for understanding CSA in the middle to later years of life that should be considered in further investigations
Half of the participants had not disclosed their CSA experiences before the age of 19. Retrospective aspect of the study could imply recall issues. All participants had disclosed and received counseling at some before participating in the study. High level of rigor in establishing trustworthiness of the data and analysis
Offender generated data through self-reports could be subject to cognitive distortions-- minimization or exaggerations.

Summary

To investigate the feasibility of using child assessments as data sources of informal CSA disclosure. To assess if these reports provide substantive data on disclosures
This study aimed to explore how the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, especially whether these relations are intrafamilial or extrafamilial, impact CSA disclosure
Study focus was on identification of barriers to CSA disclosure with male survivors

victim disclosure. Semistructured interviews based on the QID questionnaire. File reports of children seen for assessment in a child sexual abuse unit in a children's hospital were reviewed
File reports of children seen for assessment in a child sexual abuse unit in a children's hospital were reviewed
Using qualitative content analysis, researchers conducted a secondary analysis of online survey data, the 2010 Health and Well-Being Survey, that included men with self-reported CSA histories with an open-ended item on disclosure barriers

and 17 years old. Majority were White, uneducated, almost half unemployed before their arrest Content analysis was completed on 39 files (32 females and 7 males) based on a coding framework. Parents were asked to consent to have their child's file reviewed for the study. Victims assessed were 12-18 years of age 220 minor victims-- 78.2% female victims, 41.8% aged between 14 and 18 (most prevalent age range), and 48.2% were abused by a family member
460 men with CSA histories completed an anonymous, Internetbased survey. Recruited from survivors' organizations. Age range of 18-84 years. Two thirds of respondents reported clergy-related abuse. Majority of respondents were White

the time of the abuse, or if the victim resisted during the offense. Male victims and victims from dysfunctional backgrounds were less likely to disclose
Majority of children told their mothers (43%) and peers (33%) first. Three major themes were identified as influencing the disclosure process: (1) feeling distressed, (2) opportunity to tell, and (3) fears for self. Additional themes of being believed, shame/self-blame, and peer influence were also identified
Disclosure processes were more complex when it concerned sexual abuse committed by intrafamilial perpetrator: 60% of the victims reveal the facts several years after, and most often to individuals outside the family (78.6% of the disclosures done at school); on the contrary, extrafamilial disclosures take place more spontaneously and quickly: 80% of the victims reveal the facts a few days after, most often to their mother or peers
Vast majority of participants (94.6%) were sexually abused by another male. Duration of sexual abuse broke down into: 30.2% less than 6 months, 32.3% 6 months to 3 years, and 34.3% more than 3 years. Ten years old was average age of CSA onset. Ten categories of barriers were classified into three domains: (1) sociopolitical: masculinity, limited resources; (2) interpersonal: mistrust of others, fear of being labeled "gay," safety and protection issues, past responses; and (3) personal: internal emotions, seeing the experience as sexual abuse, and sexual orientation.

Perspectives of offenders on vulnerability of victims in relation to disclosure could be important information to inform interventions The sample size is small but will contribute to a large multisite study in Ireland. Serves as an important exploratory pilot bringing forward disclosure themes for consideration
The relationship with the perpetrator has a significant impact on both timing and recipient of disclosure, with intrafamilial abuses less likely to be disclosed promptly and within the family system
At time of the study, this was the largest qualitative data set to have been analyzed with an explicit focus on adult male survivors' perceptions of barriers to CSA disclosure. Because the sample was limited in terms of the low percentage of racial minorities (9.3%), disclosure differences based on race or ethnicity were not discerned. The majority of abuse reported was by clergy which might present a unique set of barriers to disclosure

Study purpose was to describe male CSA disclosure processes using a life span approach examining differences based on age. Also, to explore relationships between disclosure attributes and men's mental health
Qualitative study asked the central research question: "How do children tell?" Objective was to develop theory of how children tell of their CSA disclosure experiences. Parents were interviewed.
To investigate the process of CSA disclosure with adolescents from the general population who had experienced CSA. How many disclosed, who did

Cross-sectional survey design. Eligible participants were screened and completed an anonymous, Internetbased survey during 2010. Measures used: General Mental Health Distress Scale and General Assessment of Individual Needs. Questions related to CSA disclosure and supports were included
Grounded theory method study. Interviews were conducted. Line-byline open and axial coding was conducted on verbatim transcripts
Data collection was through face-to-face qualitative interviews. Standardized questions and measures were administered on family situation, sociodemographic

Purposive sampling of 487 men from three national organizations devoted to raising awareness of CSA among men. Age range: 19-84 years. Mean age for onset of CSA was 10.3 years
Sample of 22 young people; 16 girls and 6 boys; age range: 8-18 years; 22 interviewed in total between the ages of 8 and 18. Mixed sample of some enduring intrafamilial CSA, some extrafamilial CSA, and two endured both forms
Convenience sample of 26 sexually victimized adolescents. 23 girls and 3 boys. Age range: 15-18 years. Online advertisements and flyers were used to recruit youth from

Older age and being abused by a family member were both related to delays in disclosure. Most participants who told someone during childhood did not receive emotionally supportive or protective responses and the helpfulness of responses across the life span was mixed. Delays in telling were significant periods of time (over 20 years). Approximately one half of the participants first told about the sexual abuse to a spouse/partner (27%) or a mental health professional (20%); 42% of participants reported that their most helpful discussion was with a mental health professional. However, unhelpful responses caused most mental distress. Clinical recommendations included more of a life-course perspective be adopted, understanding impact of unhelpful responses and the importance of expanding networks for male survivors
A theoretical model was developed that conceptualizes the process of CSA disclosure as one of containing the secret: (1) the active withholding of the secret on the part of the child; (2) the experience of a "pressure cooker effect" reflecting a conflict between the wish to tell and the wish to keep the secret; and (3) the confiding itself which often occurs in the context of a trusted relationship. These were derived from eleven categories that were developed through open and axial coding
Less than one third of participants immediately disclosed CSA to another person. In most cases, recipients of both immediate and delayed disclosure were to peers. More than one third of participants had never disclosed the abuse to a parent. Participants reported reluctance to disclose to parents so as

Purposive sampling of men from awareness raising organizations may have attracted particular participants who had already disclosed and received help. Participants needed to have access to Internet which would have eliminated men in lower SES groups and required proficiency in English which would eliminate certain cultural groups. However, the sampling strategy gained access to a predominantly hidden population. Important clinical recommendations are made with an emphasis on a life-course focus
Modest but sufficient sample for an exploratory qualitative inquiry. High level of trustworthiness rigor. A subsample of randomly selected transcripts was independently coded. Very young children and young adults were not captured in this sample. Transferability of findings can only be made to the age range sampled in the context of Ireland
Two thirds of the sample did not disclose right away. Strengthening parent-child relationships may be one of the most important ways to increase disclosure to parents. Disclosure to peers has been found a common trend in other

Aim of this study was to develop a fuller understanding of CSA disclosures

Face-toface in-depth interviews were conducted with participants. Data were analyzed using Rosenthal and Fischer- Rosenthal's (2004) method.
Study sought to find out if process issues of disclosure could be identified in the context of forensic interviews. Forensic interviewers were asked to incorporate questions about "telling" into an existing forensic interview protocol. Interview content related to the children's reasons for telling or waiting was extracted, transcribed, and analyzed using grounded theory method of analysis

community and counseling services
Purposive sampling was employed. Sample consisted of 22 participants aged 25- 70 years; 13 women and 9 men. Participants were sexually abused at 15 years or under with someone over the age of 18.
191 interviews of CSA victims aged 3-18 over a 1-year period were used for the study. Inclusion criteria included children who made a statement about CSA prior to referral, reasons for telling or waiting to tell, and those who spoke English. Participants were children who were interviewed at a child sexual abuse clinic. 74% were female and 51% were Caucasian

not to burden them. Earlier disclosures were related to extrafamilial CSA, single occurrence CSA, age of victim at abuse onset, and parents who were living together. Higher levels of reported guilt and shame were related to delayed disclosures. Peers were viewed by this sample as more reliable confidants Only 5 out of 22 participants told anyone about their early sexual experiences as children. Fear, shame, and self-blame were the main inhibitors to disclosure. These factors are further detailed through subthemes. Telling as a child and as an adult was further expanded upon using Alaggia's (2004) framework verifying behavioral indirect attempts to tell and purposeful disclosure as categories. Thematic analysis supported that CSA disclosure should be conceptualized and viewed as a complex and lifelong process Reasons the children identified for telling were classified into three domains: (1) disclosure as a result of internal stimuli (e.g., the child had nightmares); (2) disclosure facilitated by outside influences (e.g., the child was questioned); and (3) disclosure due to direct evidence of abuse (e.g., the child's abuse was witnessed). The barriers to disclosure identified fell into five groups: (1) threats made by the perpetrator (e.g., the child was told she or he would get in trouble if she or he told), (2) fears (e.g., the child was afraid something bad would happen if she or he told), (3) lack of opportunity (e.g., the child felt the opportunity to disclose never presented), (4) lack of understanding (e.g., the child failed to recognize abusive behavior as unacceptable), and (5) relationship with the perpetrator (e.g., the child thought the perpetrator was a friend)

Delayed disclosure was common in this qualitative sample. Most participants did not make a selective disclosure until adulthood. These findings support Alaggia's (2004) model of disclosure but also highlights the importance of life stage. Modest but sufficient sample size for a qualitative inquiry. Well-designed study with detailed analysis for transferability of findings

Summary

The study aimed to identify factors impeding or promoting CSA disclosures. Overarching research question: What individual, interpersonal, environmental, and contextual influences impede or promote CSA disclosures.
This examination of CSA disclosure explored the ways culture affects processes of CSA disclosure and reporting, both in the United States and internationally
This study explored disclosure strategies with a national sample of youth focusing on

A qualitative phenomenological design, LIM, was used to interview adult CSA survivors about their disclosure experiences to provide retrospective accounts of CSA disclosure and meaning-making of these experiences. Thematic analysis was done through a social- ecological lens.
Using published literature with clinical data, this article conducted an analysis to provide a culturally competent framework for CSA disclosure questioning
Forms were completed by youth following participation in abuse prevention

Purposive sampling was employed. Snowball sampling was also used to recruit more male survivors. 40 adult survivors of CSA were interviewed: 36% men and 64% women. Age range of 18-65 with a mean age of 40.1 years. Average age of abuse onset was 5.3 years old. 36% of the sample was non-White. Diverse socioeconomic backgrounds
Data consisted of published literature on disclosure and culture that was triangulated with clinical case material
Examination of results from a national sample of 1,621 evaluation forms where youth

Themes fell into four domains: (1) individual and developmental factors, developmental factors as to whether they comprehended what was happening, personality traits also had some bearing on their ability to tell, and anticipating not being believed; (2) disclosure inhibited by family characteristics such as rigidly fixed gender roles with dominating fathers, chaos and aggression, other forms of child abuse, domestic violence, dysfunctional communication, and social isolation; (3) neighborhood and community context, that is, lack of interest from neighbors and teachers not pursuing troubling behavior; and (4) cultural and societal attitudes, media messages and societal attitudes, feeling unheard as kids, gender socialization for males, and cultural attitudes influencing parent's reactions. Purposeful disclosure is higher than reported in other studies because of the sampling attempts to purposefully locate disclosers
Cultural and structural factors affecting CSA disclosure are identified in in-depth detail. Recommendations made include (1) disclosure interviewing should be tailored to the child's cultural context, (2) questioning should also take into consideration age and gender factors, and (3) culture stands as an important factor in all cases in which children are considering disclosing or being asked to disclose, and not solely in cases in which children are from noticeable minority groups. Presents a comprehensive interview framework integrating cultural considerations
Youth who have been abused or witnesses to abuse employ five disclosure strategies: using self-harming behaviors to signal the abuse to others; not talking

The study presents a comprehensive social-ecological analysis to CSA disclosure highlighting the multifaceted influences. Of note, 42% had disclosed the abuse during childhood; 26% had not disclosed because they had repressed the memory, or the abuse had occurred in preschool years and they had difficulty with recall. The remainder had attempted some form of disclosure in indirect ways during childhood. A retrospective approach that could be affected by recall issues
One of the few works that adds knowledge to culturally contextual disclosure interviewing. Unique combination of literature findings with clinical material. Anecdotal accounts may preclude transferability of findings. Overall adds to an impoverished area of CSA disclosure information
This study highlights that disclosure is an interactive ongoing process. Findings lend support to studies that have identified similarly (continued)

(1) What are the hidden experiences of abuse among Canadian youth? (2) What impact does participation in abuse prevention programs have on youth to express their abuse experiences? (3) What disclosure barriers do youth face? (4) What are young people's disclosure patterns? and (5) Who do they tell? This study explored abuse disclosure strategies with a national sample of Canadian youth who participated in violence prevention programming. One of the goals of the study was to document not previously identified experiences of abuse and youth attitudes toward disclosure of abuse experiences

programming by the Canadian Red Cross (RespectED). A series of focus groups and observations of the workshops were used to help contextualize the findings. Evaluation forms were analyzed from two violence prevention programs: (1) It's not your fault and (2) What's love got to do with It?
Exploratory design with a nonrepresentative samples. Qualitative analysis of 1,099 evaluation forms completed following Red Cross RespectED violence prevention programming delivered between 2000 and 2003. Forms of anonymous abuse disclosures by youth participants of neglect, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Twenty-seven interviews and focus groups were also done to understand contextual issues and engage youth and program facilitators in the interpretation of findings. A coding structure was developed for analysis to synthesize themes across data sources

at all about the abuse to prevent intrusive interventions by others; seeking help from peers; seeking help from informal adult supports; and seeking help from mandated service providers (social workers and police). Results suggest disclosure is an interactive process, with expectations regarding consequences to disclosure. Patterns of incrementally sharing abuse experiences are shaped by young people's interactions with peers, educators, and caregivers. About threequarters of females previously disclosed; significantly less males disclosed
Findings suggest high rates of hidden abuse, with less than one quarter of youth reporting a disclosure. 244 of the 1,099 youth who disclosed abuse on their evaluation forms identified specific individuals they told about their abuse. Disclosure patterns vary with boys, youth aged 14-15, victims of physical abuse, and those abused by a family member being most likely to disclose to professionals or the police. One third of disclosures were directed toward professionals and the least, 5% percent each, were directed toward friends, parents, and others. Participants were most likely to disclose sexual abuse to parents/family, professionals, and the police/courts, with fewer choosing friends.
Out of all 1,099 participants, 225 males and 779 females indicated that they had been abused. Out of those, 43 males and 180 females indicated that they had disclosed the abuse. Of those who had disclosed, only a portion of males and females specified who they had disclosed the abuse to ("While 1,099 evaluations with disclosure statements were analyzed, only 22% made mention of people to

interactive models of disclosure such as those detailed by Alaggia (2004) and Staller and NelsonGardell (2005). This mixed sample of youth who experienced different forms of abuse and violence exposure were participants--not limited to CSA survivors
Innovative design of this study provides insight into young people's perceptions of disclosure experiences. High level of rigor with trustworthiness of the data analysis ensured through use of youth focus groups, interviews, and observational data. The study results are somewhat limited in the thickness of the descriptions it can offer because most of the data are survey based. Regional differences may not have been picked up.

Summary

Participants completed 65-item questionnaire that included questions about background, consensual sex, sexual abuse experiences (noncontact, contact or penetrating abuse, including peer abuse), disclosure of CSA, own sexual abusive behavior, sexual attitudes, and experiences with pornography and sexual exploitation. The questionnaire included 6 modified items from the SCL-90 and 9 of 25 items from the Parental Bonding Instrument. The data for girls and boys were analyzed separately
Male survivors of CSA were interviewed about their disclosure experiences. Analytic techniques included

The sample consisted of 4,339 high school students in Sweden (2,324 girls and 2,015 boys). The mean age of the participants was 18.15 years. This study used a subsample of 1,962 participants who reported CSA and who answered disclosure questions

whom disclosures occurred.") More females specified who they disclosed to compare to males. The data show perceptions among youth of negative consequences following disclosure Of the sample, 1,505 girls (65%) and 457 boys (23%) reported CSA. The disclosure rate was 81% (girls) and 69% (boys). Girls and boys disclosed most often to a friend of their own age. Few had disclosed to professionals, and even fewer had reported to the authorities. There were higher rates of disclosure to a professional with more severe abuse (contact abuse with or without penetration) for girls, but lower rates for boys The more severe the sexual abuse was, the less likely both girls and boys had talked to their mother, father, or a sibling. Girls were less likely to disclose if they had experienced contact sexual abuse with or without penetration, less frequent abuse, abuse by a family member, or if they had perceived their parents as less caring and less overprotective and highly overprotective. Boys were less likely to disclose if a family member abused them, they were studying a vocational program (vs. an academic program), lived with both parents or had perceived their parents as less caring and not overprotective. Adolescents who reported CSA perceived their mental health as poorer compared to adolescents without CSA. Nondisclosers reported more symptoms on the Mental Health Scale than those who had disclosed Barriers to disclosure were found to be operant in three interrelated domains: (1) personal (e.g., lack of cognitive awareness, intentional avoidance, emotional readiness, and shame); (2)

This study highlighted that sexual abuse is largely hidden from adult society, especially from professionals and the legal system. However, time lapsed to disclosure was not reported. Since friends appeared to be the main recipients of sexual abuse disclosures, practice implications of this could be to find ways to give young people better information and guidance about how to support a sexually abused peer. A qualitative component to the study would have provided a broader understanding of disclosure processes. Study limitations include a significant amount of boys who did not complete the questions regarding disclosure on; the timing of disclosures (whether they were delayed or not) was not measured; possibility of recall bias with retrospective studies based on self-reports; and youth participants may not have understood all the questions
Since the vast majority of men in the sample had not disclosed in childhood, they may have been predisposed to identifying barriers to disclosure more

relational (e.g., fears about negative repercussions, isolation); and (3) sociocultural (e.g., lack of acceptance for men to experience or acknowledge victimization). Only 1 of the 16 men in this sample disclosed the full extent of his sexual abuse experiences while he was still a child. The other men reported that they had not disclosed, although some reported attempts to tell that were indirect or incomplete. Several other men disclosed certain experiences or elements of their abuse, but concealed others. By the time of the study, many of these men had disclosed their past experiences in a variety of relationships, including those with family members, partners, therapists, and infrequently friends. Several had only limited discussions of their sexual abuse Disclosure categories were identified as follows: (1) delayed 53% of the children delayed disclosure for between 1 week and 2 years; (2) recipient of disclosure: 47% of children first disclosed to siblings or friends, 43% first disclosed to their parents, and 10% first disclosed to another adult. 57% of the children spontaneously disclosed abuse, but 43% disclosed only after they were prompted. 50% of the children reported feeling afraid or ashamed of their parents' responses. Parents' reactions: supportive (37%) and unsupportive (63%). There was a strong correlation between predicted and actual parental reactions suggesting children anticipated their parents' likely reactions accurately. Disclosure processes varied depending on the children's ages (e.g., younger children disclosed to parents), severity and frequency of abuse, parents' expected reactions, suspects' identities, and strategies used to foster secrecy

The objectives of the current study were to identify a broad range of factors, including family dynamics that contribute to or hinder a child's ability to disclose CSA.
The study purpose was to qualitatively explore dynamics that impede or promote disclosure by examining a range of factors including gender as a dynamic-- how disclosures of females and males are similar and different, and in what ways gender affects CSA disclosure
Study examined patterns of disclosure in a large representative sample of South African CSA victims. Two study objectives to: (1) examine how and

A qualitative phenomenological design--LIM--was used to elicit disclosure experiences; facilitators and barriers; and relevant circumstances. Interviews were transcribed verbatim. Line-by-line open coding was conducted to capture family-level factors. Axial and selective coding facilitated identification of themes
Survivors of CSA were interviewed about their disclosure experiences using LIM. Analysis of 30 participant narratives was used for theme development regarding impact of gender on disclosure. Interviews were transcribed verbatim for open, axial, and selective coding. Categories and subcategories were collapsed and refining into theme areas
File reviews of all social work and medical case files for CSA victims seen at the crisis center where all cases of CSA reported to the North Durban

Purposive sampling was employed to recruit 20 adult survivors between the ages of 18 and 65 who were sexually abused by a family member. Average age of participants was 40.1 years; 60% of participants were female and 40% male. Average age of onset of abuse was 6.7 years. Mixed clinical and nonclinical sample. The majority had received treatment for CSA at some point in their lives
Purposive sampling of women and men, along with those who disclosed during the abuse and those who did not. 19 females and 11 males; 18-65 (mean 40.1) years who were sexually abused by a family member or a trusted adult. Average age of abuse onset was 5.3 years, 36% were nonwhite, and 58% had not disclosed during childhood
1,737 cases of CSA reported in the North Durban area of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, during January 2001 to December 2003. 1,614 girls and

Four major themes emerged suggesting that CSA disclosure can be significantly compromised when certain family conditions exist: (1) rigidly fixed, gender roles based on a patriarchy-based family structure; (2) presence of family violence; (3) closed, indirect family communication patterns; and (4) social isolation of the family as a whole, or specific members, played a part in CSA victims feeling they had no one safe to tell. Family systems formulations through a feminist lens are important in understanding children and families at risk of disclosure barriers
Three themes emerged for men that inhibited or precipitated disclosure for reasons related to gender: (1) fear of being viewed as homosexual; (2) profound feelings of stigmatization or isolation because of the belief that boys are rarely victimized; and (3) fear of becoming an abuser, which acted as a precipitant for disclosure. Two predominant themes with female participants related to difficulties disclosing: (1) they felt more conflicted about who was responsible for the abuse and (2) they more strongly anticipated being blamed and/or not believed
Content analysis identified two broad dimensions of disclosure: (1) agency: child-initiated disclosure versus detection by a third party and (2) temporal duration: an event versus a process. These disclosure dimensions defined four discrete categories of

Over half the participants had not disclosed the abuse during childhood. Of the nondisclosing participants, six did not disclose because they had repressed or forgotten the memory. Almost one third withheld disclosure intentionally. More data are needed on early disclosures to garner more information on facilitators of disclosure. Retrospective approach implies recall issues.

when CSA victims disclose their abuse and (2) Identify factors associated with different patterns of disclosure
This study aimed to identify characteristics of suspected child abuse victims that are associated with disclosure and nondisclosure during formal investigations
This study investigated the context in which children were able to report their child sexual abuse experiences; their views as to what made it difficult to talk about abuse; what helped them in the disclosing process; and their parent's perceptions of their disclosure processes

policing area were referred during the period of January 2001 to December 2003
Large database of suspected cases of physical and sexual abuse investigated in Israel between 1998 and 2002 was analyzed. Interviews were also conducted using standardized NICHD Investigative Interview Protocol. Archival data were analyzed
Qualitative approach to data collection and analysis was used. Therapeutic interviews o the children and mostly their mothers were analyzed through a qualitative approach. Follow-up interviews were held 1 year later

123 boys; average age of victimized children was 9.9 years. 47% reports were made within 72 hr of the abuse, 31% from 72 hr to 1 month, and 22% more than a month after the abuse
The sample was comprised of 26,446 of 3- to 14-year-old alleged victims of sexual and physical abuse interviewed in Israel in the 5-year period from 1998 to 2002. 140 experienced trained youth investigators conducted interviews
20 families with a total of 22 children participated. All children had told about experiences that created concerns for care-givers about CSA. Children's ages ranged between 3 and 16 years (average age 7.5 years); 15 girls and 7 boys. Sexually abused by someone in the family or a close person to the family

disclosure: (1) purposeful disclosure (30% of cases), (2) indirect disclosure (9% of cases), (3) eyewitness detection (18% of cases), and (4) accidental detection (43% of cases). Disclosure independently predicted by victim's age, nature of the victim-perpetrator relationship, offender's age, frequency of abuse, and reporting latency. Mean age of purposeful disclosures (10.67) was higher than the mean age of indirect disclosures (5.84). Explicit forms of disclosure were less likely when the offender was a family member. Shorter reporting latency was more likely with repeated abuse Overall, 65% of the 26,446 children made allegations when interviewed. Rates of disclosure were greater for sexual abuse (71%) over physical abuse (61%). Children of all ages were less likely to disclose/allege abuse when a parent was the suspected perpetrator. Disclosure rates increased as children grew older: 50% with 3- to 6-year-olds, 67% of the 7to 10-year-olds, and 74% of the 11- to 14-year-olds disclosed abuse when questioned
None of the children told of abuse immediately after it occurred. Children exposed to repetitive abuse kept this as a secret for up to several years; 17 told their mothers first, 3 first told a friend, 1 told their father, and 1 their uncle. Majority of remarks that led to the suspicion of CSA were made in situations where someone engaged the child in a dialogue about what was bothering them, resulting in a referral. The children felt it was difficult to find situations containing enough privacy and prompts that they could share their experiences. When the children did

with the percentage of interrater agreement at 98%. Generalizability of this study is limited to child clients receiving a crisis assessment referred through a police report
Overall findings indicated that rates of disclosure varied systematically depending on the nature of the alleged offences, the relationship between alleged victims and suspected perpetrators, and the age of the suspected victims. Analyses only involved cases that had come to the attention of official agencies, making it difficult to determine how many of abuse take place without ever triggering any kind of official investigation
Evidence for delayed disclosures. The results indicate that disclosure is a fundamentally dialogical process that becomes less difficult if children perceive that there is an opportunity to talk, a purpose for speaking and a connection has been established to what they are talking about. Strengthening parent-child relationships is an important practice implication

Summary

The purpose of this study was to understand the full process of CSA disclosure and how this unfolded for preadolescent and adolescent girls. Examined what facilitated and hindered disclosure and subsequent consequences
The study sought to examine influences that inhibit or promote children's disclosure of CSA to address gaps in knowledge about how, when, and under what circumstances victims of CSA disclose

Secondary analysis of qualitative focus group data. Original project consisted of four focus groups conducted within the context of ongoing therapy for girls who had experienced CSA. Secondary analysis consisted of written narrative summaries of each session grouping these conceptually, and examining their interconnectedness
The study employed LIM--a phenomenological design. Intensive interviewing that were 2 hr long on average generated data for a thematic analysis. The interview guide was

Sample consisted of 34 participants from four groups. Sessions analyzed were between 60 and 90 min long; audiotaped and later transcribed for content analysis

disclose they did it in situations where the topic of child sexual abuse was in some form addressed or activated, where someone recognized the child's cues and probed further. They also were sensitive to others reactions, and whether their disclosures would be misinterpreted. Several of the children perceived negative consequences as major factors contributing to delaying disclosure. They were primarily concerned about negative effects for the mother. The mothers said they were also sensitive to the children's feelings. If their children showed signs of distress and did not want to talk, the mothers would change the subject or not pursue the topic further Findings are reported in three major domains: (1) self-phase: where children come to understand victimization internally; (2) confidant selectionreaction phase: where they select a time, place, and person to tell and then whether that person's reaction was supportive or hostile; and (3) consequences phase: good and bad that continued to inform their ongoing strategies of telling. The actions and reactions of adults were significant and informed the girls' decisions. The consequences phase was further subdivided into four aspects: (1) gossiping and news networks, (2) changing relationships, (3) institutional responses and the afterlife of telling, and (4) insider and outsider communities Through analysis of the interview new categories of disclosure were identified to add to existing types. Three previously identified were confirmed in these data: accidental, purposeful, and prompted/elicited accounted for 42% of disclosure patterns in the study sample. Over half the disclosure patterns described by the study sample did not fit these

This study provided a contextual examination of the entire disclosure process, closer to the point in time when the abuse and disclosure occurred. Small groups of preadolescent and adolescent girls who had survived sexual abuse also served as consultants and were encouraged to share their knowledge for the benefit of professional practitioners
This study expanded types of CSA disclosures to more fully understand how children and adults disclose. And under what circumstances. Asking people to recount events that occurred in childhood is susceptible to memory failure, especially when memories were forgotten, (continued)

The main goals of this study were to understand impediments that prevent adolescents from disclosing CSA and seeking help from their social network and/or the services
Study purpose was to explore how abuse traits, openness, reactions to CSA disclosure, and social support were related. Differences based on severity of abuse, timing and outcomes of disclosure, social support, and predicting factors of positive and negative reactions were probed

developed to probe for individual, interpersonal, environmental, and cultural factors influencing CSA disclosure
In-depth telephone (anonymous) interviews were conducted after informed consent was explained and obtained. Three investigators experienced in counseling CSA counseling conducted the interviews which were recorded with permission. Three researchers independently scored the interviews according to a coding framework
Adult women reporting CSA by someone close were interviewed using semi-structured guides together with questionnaires. Data on victimization and current social support were retrieved through the questionnaires, and data on disclosure and reactions were gathered through the interviews with participants

average age of abuse onset was 6.5 years; 42% of the participants had disclosed the abuse during childhood; 58% disclosed as adults
The sample was comprised of 36 young people who experienced sexual abuse in adolescence; 35 females and 1 male; aged 12-17. Some of the sample experienced sexual violence in a dating relationship
122 adult women between 20 and 60 years old (average age of 41 years) reporting exposure to child sexual abuse by someone close before the age of 18 and had told someone about at least one abuse event. 90% were Swedish subjects. Purposive sampling strategy was used

previously established categories. Three additional disclosure categories emerged: behavioral and indirect verbal attempts, disclosures intentionally withheld, and disclosures triggered by recovered memories
The main impediments to disclose to a family member were: fear of not being believed, shame, and fear of causing trouble to the family. The main impediments for not seeking services were: unaware of appropriate services, wish to keep the secret, lack of awareness of being abused, mistrust of adults and professionals, and fear of the consequences of disclosing sexual abuse. When they did disclose to professionals, teens received very limited support as many professionals were not trained on sexual abuse and could not offer appropriate interventions to victims
Abuse characteristics: abuse by multiple perpetrators was more common than by a single perpetrator. Age of onset was often before age of 7, with an average duration of 7 years. Severely abused women had talked to more of their social network, especially to professionals. Disclosures: 32% disclosed during childhood (before the age of 18) with an average of 21 years delay. Women who had disclosed in childhood reported more instances of physical abuse, multiple perpetrators, use of violence, and were more likely to have confronted a perpetrator, and had received a negative first reaction. Factors

delayed, or repressed and later recovered. Distortion and revision of events are also potential problems in recall. High degree of trustworthiness of the data was achieved and quotes provided supported the categories This study represented the findings of a mixed sample of survivors of child sexual abuse and intimate partner violence. The study was conducted in Italy and it is not clear what sexual abuse response training is available. There may have been a selection bias as the most dissatisfied survivors responded to the research call
68% delayed disclosure until adulthood. At the time of the study, it was one of the first studies to focus on the interplay between social support networks and disclosure of child sexual abuse. The study results are somewhat limited by an overrepresentation of severely abused women. Retrospective study and self-report of information could imply recall issues and thus limits the accuracy of the information obtained on abuse and disclosure characteristics. Cross-sectional

Summary

The purpose of this study was to identify factors that influence the disclosures made by female survivors of USE in childhood and adolescence. The predictors of both the timing of disclosure and the recipient of the disclosure were investigated
The purpose of this study was to investigate variables associated with delay of disclosure of CSA and test a model for factors that influence how quickly children disclose sexual abuse

Data were gathered from a subsample of female adolescents that participated in the NSA, which consisted of structured phone interviews. USEs reported in the NSA were assessed using a modified version of the Incident Classification Interview. They were then asked a series of questions about each episode of unwanted sexual contact including event characteristics and perpetrator characteristics
Case file reviews of data obtained from prosecution files, as well as from structured interviews with the children's caretaker and observations of child interviews. Trained graduate students and one victim advocate completed the Sexual Assault Profile

A subsample of 263 adolescent females between 12 and 17 years old, mean age of 15.2 years old, who reported at least one experience of unwanted sexual contact in the NSA.
Participant characteristics, USE characteristics, and family contextual attributes were explored
Sample consisted of 218 children referred to prosecutors' offices for alleged CSA. All children in the sample had disclosed their abuse in some manner. Children ranged in age from 2 to 16 years at the beginning of abuse; 3-16 years at the end of the abuse, and 4-16 years at the time of the

significantly predicting delay were younger age at first event and no use of violence. Disclosure outcomes: of the 26 women who told in childhood during a period with ongoing abuse, 15 women were continuously abused after disclosure Children under the age of 7 were at a higher risk for delayed disclosures. Participants whose USE occurred between the ages of 7 and 13 were most likely to tell an adult. Adolescents (14- 17) were more likely to tell only peers than children aged 7-10 years. Children under 11 were more likely to tell an adult, but were at risk for delaying disclosure beyond a month. Children aged 11-13 tended to disclose within a month. Closer relationship to the perpetrator or a family member was associated with delayed disclosure. Immediate disclosure was more likely with stranger perpetration. Fear for one's life during and penetration were associated with disclosure to adults. Family factors linked to disclosure were (1) drug abusing household member, which made survivors more likely to disclose more promptly and (2) never living with both parents was associated with nondisclosure 64% disclosed within a month and 29% within 6 months. Five variables for the model were tested. (1) age: children who were older took longer to disclose and older children feared more negative consequences to others than younger children; (2) type of abuse: victims of intrafamilial families took longer to disclose--victims of intrafamilial abuse feared greater negative consequences to others compared to victims of extrafamilial abuse; (3) fear of negative consequences: children who feared

design does not allow for definite conclusions of cause and effect on the relationships found
This study examined factors including disclosures of USEs in childhood and adolescence in a nationally representative sample of female adolescents who participated in the NSA. Surveys for investigations of victimization experiences may be biased due to underreporting. Adolescents who refused to report or discuss an USE may represent a source of systematic bias and would make the results generalizable only to adolescents who are willing to disclose USE via survey. Although data may be retrospective, recall bias may have been minimized in this study since participants were adolescents, and so the time lag between the USE and the interview were presumably shorter than a study of adult participants recalling CSA experiences
This study represents a higher rate of disclosers within a month. These cases had been reported to authorities and were in process of prosecution which may explain higher rate of early disclosures. Legal sample with higher rate of extrafamilial abuse (52%) may also account for earlier disclosures. Model suggests that older children, victims of intrafamilial abuse; felt greater responsibility for the abuse, and perceiving

The study focus was to gather data from a large sample of women about the length of time women who were raped before age 18 delayed disclosure who they disclosed to, and variables that predicted disclosure within 1 month

questionnaire for child characteristics, the abuse and their disclosure. Children's perception of responsibility and fear of negative consequences were probed. Correlational analyses were conducted with path analyses to test the hypothesized causal relations among variables Structured telephone interviews that lasted approximately 35 min were used to collect data using a computerassisted telephone interview system. All telephone interviews were conducted with each question on a computer screen. The survey consisted of several measures designed to elicit demographic information, psychiatric symptoms, substance use, and victimization history. The present study reports on data from the demographic and child rape victimization questions

initial police report; 77% female, 70% Caucasian, 17% Hispanic, and 11% African American. Predominantly middle to low SES. Approximately 47% intrafamilial abuse
Two probability samples. Wave 1 was a random sample of 2,009 respondents selected from stratified samples of defined jurisdictions.
Random digital dialing was used to solicit households for listed and unlisted telephone numbers. Second random sample of 2,000 women between the ages of 18 and 34 was selected. Both Wave 1 and Wave 2 data were weighted to conform to the 1989 Census statistics

negative consequences of disclosure took longer to disclose, children who believed that their disclosure would bring harm to others took longer to disclose, fear of negative consequences to the self or the perpetrator was unrelated to time of disclosure, and girls more than boys feared negative consequences to others; (4) Perceived responsibility: children who felt greater responsibility for the abuse took longer to disclose and older children felt more responsibility for the abuse; and (5) gender was not significantly correlated with time to disclosure 288 (9%) reported experiencing at least one event that met the study's definition of childhood rape. The average age at the time of the first rape was 10.9 years. Of the 288 women who reported a child rape, 28% stated that they had never told anyone about this sexual assault until specifically queried by the interviewer for this study. 58% did not disclose for over 1 year and up to 5 years post-rape. 27% disclosed within a month. Among women who disclosed prior to their NWS interview close friends were the most common person to whom victims made disclosures, followed by mothers and other immediate family members. Fewer than 10% of victims reported making their initial disclosure to social workers or law enforcement personnel. Only 12% of child rape victims stated that their assaults were reported to authorities at some point

negative consequences to disclosing took longer to disclose. Well-designed study with high level of rigor. Produced a viable model of disclosure for further investigations. However, researchers were not able to interview children directly
The time frame of this survey may have had contextual implications. The majority of child rapes reported by this sample occurred prior to the large-scale child assault prevention education programs that were begun in the 1980s that teach children that assaults (including CSA) are wrong and should be disclosed to responsible adults. This information may have influenced (and may currently be influencing) young women's disclosure patterns. For Wave 1, comparison of these data with the population parameters obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau indicated that the sample closely matched the demographic attributes of the population of U.S. women

TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 20(2)

examples of this usage were found in the research questions, interview guides, and surveys examined: "How and when do people decide to tell others about their early sexual experiences with adults?" (Hunter, 2011, p. 161); "Some men take many years to tell someone that they were sexually abused. Please describe why it may be difficult for men to tell about/discuss the sexual abuse" (Easton, Saltzman, & Willis, 2014, p. 462). "Participants were asked a series of open-ended questions to elicit a narrative regarding their experiences of telling . . . " (McElvaney, Greene, & Hogan, 2012, p. 1160). "Who was the first person you told?" (Schaeffer, Leventhal, & Anes, 2011, p. 346).
There was sound consistency between studies, defining disclosure in multifaceted ways with uniform use of categories of prompted, purposeful, withheld, accidental, direct, and indirect. However, defining the period of time that would delineate a disclosure as delayed varied widely across studies, wherein some studies viewed 1 week or 1 month as a delayed disclosure (i.e., Hershkowitz et al., 2007; Kogan, 2004; Scho¨nbucher, Maier, Moher-Kuo, Schnyder, & Lamdolt, 2012). Other studies simply reported average years of delay sometimes as long as from 20 to 46 years (Easton, 2013; Jonzon & Linblad, 2004; Smith et al., 2000).
Second, the number of qualitative studies has increased significantly over the last 15 years. This rise is in response to a previous dearth of qualitative studies. Based on Jones's (2000) observation that disclosure factors and outcomes had been well documented through quantitative methods; in a widely read editorial, he recommended "Qualitative studies which are able to track the individual experiences of children and their perception of the influences upon them which led to their disclosure of information are needed to complement . . . " (p. 270).
Third, although a few studies strived to obtain representative samples in quantitative investigations (Hershkowitz, Horowitz, & Lamb, 2005; Kogan, 2004; Smith et al., 2000), sampling was for the most part convenience based, relying on voluntary participation in surveys and consent-based participation in file reviews (Collings, Griffiths, & Kumalo, 2005; Priebe & Svedin, 2008; Scho¨nbucher et al., 2012; Ungar, Barter, McConnell, Tutty, & Fairholm, 2009a). Therefore, generalizability of findings is understandably limited. The qualitative studies used purposive sampling as is deemed appropriate for transferability of findings to similar populations. Some of those samples contained unique characteristics, since they were sought through counseling centers or sexual advocacy groups. These would be considered clinical samples producing results based on disclosures that may have been delayed or problematic. This might presumably produce data skewed toward barriers and bring forward less information on disclosure facilitators.
Through an in-depth, second-level analysis, this review identified five distinct themes and subthemes beyond the general trends as noted earlier.
Theme 1: Disclosure is viewed as an ongoing process as opposed to a discrete event--iterative and interactive in nature. A subtheme was identified regarding disclosure as

being facilitated within a dialogical and relational context is being more clearly delineated. Theme 2: Contemporary disclosure models reflect a social-ecological, person-in-environment perspective to understand the complex interplay of individual, familial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure. Subthemes include new categories of disclosure and a growing focus on previously missing cultural and contextual factors. Theme 3: Age and gender are strong predictors for delaying disclosure or withholding disclosure with trends showing fewer disclosures by younger children and boys. One subtheme emerged that intrafamilial abuse/family-like relationship of perpetrator has a bearing on disclosure delays or withholding. Theme 4: There is a lack of a cohesive life-course perspective. One subtheme includes the lack of data within the 18to 24-year-old emerging adult population. Theme 5: Significantly more information is available on barriers than on facilitators of CSA disclosure. Subthemes of shame, self-blame, and fear are uniformly identified as disclosure deterrents.
Disclosure as an ongoing process: Iterative and interactive in nature. Disclosure is now generally accepted as a complex and lifelong process, with current trends showing that CSA disclosures are too often delayed until adulthood (Collin-Ve´zina et al., 2015; Easton, 2013; Hunter, 2011). Knowledge building about CSA disclosure has moved in the direction of understanding this as an iterative and interactive process rather than a discrete, onetime event. Since the new millennium, disclosure is being viewed as a dynamic, rather than static, process and described "not as a single event but rather a carefully measured process" (Alaggia, 2005, p. 455). The catalyst for this view originates from Summit (1983) who initially conceptualized CSA disclosures as process based, although this notion was not fully explored until several years later. Examinations of Summit's (1983) groundbreaking proposition of the CSA accommodation (CSAA) model produced varying results as to whether his five stages of secrecy, helplessness, entrapment and accommodation, delayed, conflicted, and unconvincing disclosures, and retraction or recantation, hold validity (for a review, see London, Bruck, Ceci, & Shuman, 2005). However, the idea of disclosure as a process has been carried over into contemporary thinking.
Recently, McElvaney, Greene, and Hogan (2012) detailed a process model of disclosure wherein they describe an interaction of internal factors with external motivators which they liken to a "pressure cooker" effect, preceded by a period of containment of the secret. Moreover, this and other studies strongly suggest disclosures are more likely to occur within a dialogical context--activated by discussions of abuse or prevention forums providing information about sexual abuse (Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Jensen, Gulbrandsen, Mossige, Reichelt, & Tjersland, 2005; Ungar et al., 2009a). The term

dialogical simply means to participate in dialogue. Key dialogical vehicles identified in these studies were providing sexual abuse information through prevention programs, being asked about sexual abuse, and being prompted to tell (McElvaney et al., 2012; Ungar et al., 2009a).
Contemporary models of CSA disclosure reflect a social-ecological perspective. Knowledge on CSA disclosure has been steadily advancing toward a holistic understanding of the complex interplay of individual, familial, contextual, and cultural factors (Alaggia & Kirshenbaum, 2005; Brazelton, 2015; Fontes & Plummer, 2010). Where at one time factors examined and identified were predominantly of intrapersonal factors of child victims, knowledge construction has shifted to fuller social- ecological, person-in-environment explanations (Alaggia, 2010; Collin-Ve´zina et al., 2015; Easton et al., 2014; Hunter, 2011; Ungar, Tutty, McConnell, Barter, & Fairholm, 2009b). Social-ecological explanations open up more opportunities to intervene in facilitating earlier disclosures. Alaggia (2010) proposes an ecological mapping of what individual, interpersonal, environmental, and contextual influences impede or promote CSA disclosures based on analysis of in-depth interview data of 40 adult survivors. Subsequently, based on a sample of 67 adult survivors, Collin-Ve´zina, Sablonni, Palmer, and Milne (2015) identified three broad categories, closely aligned with an ecological framework that impede CSA disclosure: (1) barriers from within, (2) barriers in relation to others, and (3) barriers in relation to the social world which can be aligned to intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual factors.
A summary of knowledge building using a social-ecological framework follows. Knowledge gained in the intrapersonal domain includes expanded conceptualization of disclosure by building on previous categories of accidental, purposeful, and prompted disclosure to also include behavioral and indirect attempts to tell, intentionally withheld disclosure, and triggered and recovered memories (Alaggia, 2004). Categories of indirect behavioral disclosure patterns have been further verified in follow-up research by Hunter (2011), and through an extensive file review that used Alaggia's (2004) disclosure framework to analyze their data (Collings et al., 2005) for verification.
Interpersonal factors have also emerged in regard to certain family characteristics as disclosure barriers. Families with rigidly fixed gender roles, patriarchal attitudes, power imbalances, other forms of child abuse and domestic violence, chaotic family structure, dysfunctional communication, and social isolation have been found to suppress disclosure (Alaggia & Kirshenbaum, 2005; Collin-Ve´zina et al., 2015; Fontes & Plummer, 2010). In addition, relationship with perpetrator is a factor whereby research indicates that disclosure is made more difficult when the perpetrator is a family member or close to the family (Dumont, Messerschmitt, Vila, Bohu, & ReySalmon, 2014;Easton, 2013; Goodman-Brown et al., 2003; Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Priebe & Svedin, 2008; Scho¨nbucher et al., 2012). This is especially a barrier when the perpetrator lives with the victim (LeClerc & Wortley, 2015).

In terms of environmental factors, one study revealed that neighborhood/community conditions can hinder disclosure when there is lack of school involvement in providing a supportive environment, such as in following up on troubling student behavior (Alaggia, 2010). Additionally, a child victim's anticipation of a negative response to disclosure, especially that they may not be believed by others outside their family such as neighbors or other community members, has shown to deter disclosure (Collin-Ve´zina et al., 2015).
Cultural factors influencing CSA disclosure have been studied to a much lesser degree. Despite this, a few important studies examining critical sociocultural factors now exist for better understanding CSA disclosure within a cultural context (Brazelton, 2015; Fontes & Plummer, 2010). Among these important contributions, Brazelton's (2015) research has delineated CSA disclosure processes as "shaped by relational, racial, socio-cultural, historical, and developmental factors" (p. 182). In a unique study using culturally focused research literature as data triangulated with clinical case material, culturally based belief systems in many cultures have been found to foster family climates that can silence children from disclosing abuse (Fontes & Plummer, 2010). Taboos about sexuality, patriarchal attitudes, and devaluation of women are among some of the cultural barriers that inhibit disclosure (Fontes & Plummer, 2010).
Clearly, disclosure conceptualizations are being integrated into a social-ecological model of individual and developmental factors, family dynamics, neighborhood, and community context as well as cultural and societal attitudes toward better understanding disclosure barriers and facilitators (Alaggia, 2010), although more data are needed on cultural and contextual factors.
Age and gender as predictors of disclosure Age. Age is consistently found to be an influential factor in
CSA disclosure, making the life stage of the victim/survivor a critical consideration. Studies draw distinctions in age-groups falling into either under or over 18 years of age. Eighteen years of age was the common age cutoff point that investigators chose in order to distinguish child/youth populations from adult samples. Sixteen of the studies drew on samples of children and youth, while the other 15 studies sampled adults over the age of 18, and a further two studies used mixed age-groups (refer to Table 1). Among the child and youth samples, the age ranges spanned from preschool to late adolescence (3-17 years of age), with varying methodological approaches implemented across age cohorts. For younger cohorts, file reviews and secondary data analyses of CSA reports were typically undertaken. Adolescents were most often given surveys. Sometimes children and youth were interviewed as part of administering a survey or as a follow-up (Crisma et al., 2004; Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Ungar et al., 2009b). In the majority of child and adolescent samples, sexual abuse concerns were already flagged to investigative authorities. However, the work of Ungar, Barter, McConnell, Tutty, and Fairholm (2009a, 2009b) is one exception, whereby their survey elicited new disclosures.

278

TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 20(2)

Adult studies typically had a mean age between 40 and 50 years. Interviews were the main data collection method with a few exceptions using survey designs (i.e., Easton, 2013; Kogan, 2004; Smith et al., 2000) and case file reviews (i.e., Collings et al., 2005; Goodman-Brown et al., 2003). Results show a clear trend toward increased likelihood of disclosure in older youth, and findings from adult samples showing a preponderance of disclosures in adulthood, with the large majority of participants of adults reporting never having had a sexual abuse complaint filed with investigative authorities as a child or an adolescent (i.e., Hunter, 2011; Gagnier & Collin-Ve´zina, 2016; Sorsoli, Kia-Keating, & Grossman, 2008; Ungar et al., 2009b).
With children and youth under the ages of 18 distinct patterns emerged. First, accidental detection, rather than purposeful disclosure, is more likely to occur with younger children. For example, in one large-scale study of over 1,737 file reviews, over half of the CSA-related cases were identified through accidental and eyewitness detection (61%), while less than one third were purposeful disclosures initiated by the child victim (Collings et al., 2005). A second pattern which emerged is that rates of disclosure increase with age, especially into adulthood, which is supported by persistent findings of high rates of delayed disclosure reported later in the life course by adult survivors (Collings et al., 2005; Collin-Ve´zina et al., 2015 ; Easton, 2013; Jonzon & Linblad, 2004; Kogan, 2004; Leclerc & Wortley, 2015; Sorsoli et al., 2008). While gender and relationship with the perpetrator are considerable factors in CSA disclosure, age is consistently a stronger predictor of disclosure (or nondisclosure) (Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Leclerc & Wortley, 2015). Third, younger children who disclose are more likely to do so in an interview situation or other environment that provides prompts or questions about sexual abuse (Hershkowitz et al., 2005; McElvaney, Greene, & Hogan, 2014; Schaeffer et al., 2011), but this trend can also be seen in older youth (Ungar et al., 2009a, 2009b).
Gender. A number of studies have recently focused on CSA disclosures with male victims, since males have been an understudied population (Alaggia, 2005; Easton, 2013; Easton et al., 2014; Gagnier & Collin-Ve´zina, 2016). Most investigations that sampled both sexes show females outweighing male participants. Although women are at double the risk of being subjected to CSA, the ratio of women to men in most disclosure studies has not been representative. This finding may be indicative of male victims more likely delaying disclosing their CSA experiences, leaving male disclosure in child and youth samples underrepresented (He´bert, Tourigny, Cyr, McDuff, & Joly, 2009; Ungar et al., 2009b).
Easton, Saltzman, and Willis (2014) have been developing gender-specific modeling of disclosure examining male disclosures. Their proposed model groups male disclosures into barrier categories as determined by individual factors, interpersonal issues, and factors that are sociopolitical in nature. These authors suggest that predominant gender norms around masculinity reinforce the tendency for male victims of CSA to blame themselves

for the abuse, resulting in no disclosure. Male participants in a subsequent study also relayed that gender norms and stereotypes contributed to them concealing the abuse because they were abused by a woman (Gagnier & Collin-Ve´zina, 2016). In the one study that compared male and female disclosures, investigator found that men's fears of being viewed as homosexual; profound feelings of stigmatization or isolation because of the belief that boys are rarely victimized; and fear of becoming an abuser acted as disclosure barriers. Whereas females felt more conflicted about who was responsible for the abuse and more strongly anticipated being blamed and not believed (Alaggia, 2005).
Lack of a life-course perspective. Given that the study of CSA disclosure draws on age-groups ranging from samples of very young children to retrospective studies of adult survivors, with significant developmental considerations, this area of study lacks an intentional cohesive life-course perspective. Most data are derived from either cross-sectional or retrospective designs, with few longitudinal studies. There are a series of sound, yet disconnected, studies focusing on specific age-groups of children and adolescents, along with adult retrospective studies. Thus, the available knowledge base does not allow for a cohesive picture of CSA disclosure processes and pathways over the life course to emerge.
The life-course perspective has long been recommended as a critical lens for the study of child abuse (Browning & Laumann, 1997; Williams, 2003). For example, a life-course perspective has been utilized to understand the immediate- and long-term effects of CSA on the developing child victim (Browning & Laumann, 1997). Further, a life-course perspective is important in terms of examining age of onset of CSA to explain the differential effects of sexual victimization and developmental impacts in terms of understanding their ability to disclose--effects that need to be understood within a developmental context, especially for designing appropriate interventions for disclosure at critical transitions from early childhood through to adolescence and into adulthood. In addition, important "turning points" in life may facilitate disclosures. For example, entry into adulthood given that delayed disclosure occurs more often in adulthood. Alaggia (2004, 2005) found that being in a committed relationship or the birth of children acted as facilitators for some survivors to disclose, especially to their spouses. These significant life events, as contributing to disclosures, bear further examination.
Summary of barriers and facilitators. Research over the past 15 years continues to uncover barriers to CSA disclosure at a higher frequency than that of facilitators. As stated previously, this might be the result of sampling methods whereby participants who volunteer for disclosure research may have had more negative disclosure experiences, especially since many report delays in disclosure. The following section outlines the major trends in both barriers and facilitators (see Table 2).
Barriers. Age and gender were found to contribute to barriers as covered in Theme 3. Disclosures generally increase with age

Table 2. Factors Influencing Child Sexual Abuse Disclosures.

Barriers

Facilitators

Age: The younger the child victim, the less likely they will purposefully disclose.
Gender: Males may be less likely to disclose in childhood/adolescence, fear of being seen as homosexual and as a victim, females experience more self-blame and anticipation of being blamed and/or not believed
Relationship to perpetrator: If the perpetrator is a family member or in a family-like role, disclosure is less likely to happen
Internal: Shame, self-blame, and fear are psychological barriers. In addition, fear of negative consequences on the family and for selfsafety inhibits disclosure
Family relations: Families with a patriarchal structure, rigidly fixed gender roles, dysfunctional communication, other forms of abuse (i.e., domestic violence), and isolation inhibit disclosure
Environmental and cultural context: Lack of discussion about sexuality; passive acceptance that unwanted sexual experiences are inevitable; not wanting to bring shame to the family by admitting sexual abuse; lack of involvement from neighbors, school personnel; and stigma perpetuated by societal perceptions

Age: Disclosures increase with age, especially in adulthood.
Gender: Slight trend toward females who are older (adolescent) to disclose before adulthood
Relationship to perpetrator: If the perpetrator is not living with the victim, disclosure rates increase
Dialogical context: Opportunities to disclose through discussion, therapeutic relationship, information sessions on sexuality, and sexual abuse prevention programs
Family relations: Supportive parent-child relationship. Involvement of others: Eyewitnesses coming forward and reporting;
detection through community members, professionals Environmental and cultural context: Promotion of open discussion of
sexuality; community member involvement

as children gain more developmental capacity, understanding of sexual abuse as victimization, and increased independence. Males are somewhat less likely to disclose, but this is often in interaction with other factors in the environment such as societal attitudes that promote hypermasculinity as desirable, attitudes that perpetuate negative views of boys and men who are victims, and homophobic attitudes (Alaggia, 2010; Easton et al., 2014; Gagnier & Collin-Ve´zina, 2016).
Victims of intrafamilial abuse when the offender is a parent, caregiver, significant family member, or someone in a familylike role are less likely to disclose immediately or at all in childhood/adolescence because of obvious power differentials and dependency needs (Collings et al., 2005; Dumont et al., 2014; Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Kogan, 2004; Leclerc & Wortley, 2015; Paine & Hansen, 2002; Schaeffer et al., 2011).
Further, the perpetrator residing with their victim(s) increases the likelihood of no disclosure (Leclerc & Wortley, 2015).
Internalized victim-blaming, mechanisms to protect oneself (such as minimizing the impact of the abuse), and developmental immaturity at the onset of abuse constituted internal barriers. Further, shame, self-blame, and fear have been identified as significant factors deterring disclosure (Collin-Ve´zina et al., 2015; Crisma et al., 2004; Goodman-Brown et al., 2003; Hunter, 2011; Kogan, 2004; McElvaney & Culhane, 2015; McElvaney et al., 2014). However, aspects of shame, self-blame and fear, and have not been fully explored in research. Since these are strong predictors of disclosure suppression, they bear further examination in future research to understand more fully how they operate in disclosure processes.
In terms of interpersonal and environmental factors, family dynamics can play a part in deterring disclosure. As previously mentioned, families characterized by rigidly defined gender roles, patriarchal attitudes that perpetuate power imbalances

between men and women, parents and children, presence of other forms of child abuse and/or domestic violence, chaotic family structure, dysfunctional communication, and social isolation have been found to suppress disclosure (Alaggia & Kirshenbaum, 2005; Collin-Ve´zina et al., 2015; Fontes & Plummer, 2010). In regard to broader environmental factors, disclosure can be hindered when involved and supportive community members are not available, or not trained in sensitive responses, or when child victims anticipate not being believed by neighbors and other people outside the family (Alaggia, 2010; Collin-Ve´zina et al., 2015). Further, barriers in relation to the social world were identified as stigmatization, the negative labeling of sexual abuse victims, and taboos surrounding sexuality and talking about sex as driven by cultural norms (Collin-Ve´zina et al., 2015; Fontes & Plummer, 2010).
Identification of cultural barriers is important recent contribution to understanding disclosure processes--and in particular to the obstacles. Findings related to cultural barriers included themes of children's voices not being heard leading to silencing, the normalization of the sexualization and objectification of girls and women, and the perpetuation of hypermasculinity in men--all acting as barriers in terms of stigma to disclosure (Alaggia, 2005, 2010; Easton et al., 2014). Brazelton (2015) similarly found that lack of discussions about sex, young age at the onset of sexual abuse, therefore not having the language to express what was happening to them, and preserving the family good name by not talking about abuse in the family were also barriers to disclosure.
Finally, it may be the case that more barriers continue to be identified over facilitators of CSA disclosure perhaps because of the methods employed in studies--particularly those drawing on adult populations who delayed disclosure. These samples may not be representative of the overall population of CSA victims, since they may have had more negative disclosure

280

TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 20(2)

experiences, consequently more readily identifying barriers. On the other hand, these findings may speak to the actual imbalance between facilitating factors and barriers for disclosure, the latter carrying more weight in the victims/survivors' experiences, thus, explaining the high rates of disclosures delayed until adulthood.
Facilitators. Although fewer disclosure facilitators are identified in this review, very important facilitators were nonetheless uncovered--ones that should be noted for professionals in this field of practice. Internal factors that facilitate disclosures include symptoms that become unbearable, getting older with increased developmental efficacy, and realizing that an offence was committed (Collin-Ve´zina et al., 2015; Crisma et al., 2004; Easton, 2013; Hershkowitz et al. 2007; McElavaney, Greene, & Hogan, 2014; Schaeffer et al., 2011). Circumstantial facilitators are those where the child discloses because there has been evidence provided, eye-witnessing has occurred, and a report has been made. Environmental factors include settings that provide opportunities such as counseling, interviews, information sessions and educational forums/workshops, and prevention programs for children and youth to disclose.
To elaborate, dialogical contexts about CSA for children and youth can provide opportunities for discussion that may facilitate disclosures (Jensen et al., 2005). The research shows creating open dialogue in relationship contexts, to offset the power and influence of the perpetrator, can facilitate earlier disclosure. Among disclosure facilitators is being asked about abuse and given the opportunity to "tell" (McElavaney et al., 2014); workshops on abuse and sexual abuse, in particular, can facilitate disclosures (Ungar et al., 2009b); and using culturally sensitive probes and questions (Fontes & Plummer, 2010). In Gagnier and Collin-Ve´zina's (2016) study, positive disclosure experiences were described by participants as those where they felt that they had been listened to, were safe, were believed, and were not judged by the person they disclosed to. Further, family members and friends (peers) of the child victim can act as key supports to creating an open relational context and fostering positive responses (Jensen et al., 2005; Priebe & Svedin, 2008; Scho¨nbucher et al., 2012; Ungar et al., 2009b). In particular, as children grow older, they are more likely to disclose to a peer, as shown in a number of studies, and this is an important reality for counselors and educators to be aware of (Dumont et al., 2014; Kogan, 2004; Scho¨nbucher et al., 2012; Ungar et al., 2009b).
Discussion
Through examination of 33 studies published since the year 2000, this review identified five distinct themes regarding CSA disclosure: (1) Disclosure is best viewed as an iterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event done within a relational context; (2) contemporary models reflect a social-ecological, person-in-environment framework for understanding the complex interplay of individual, familial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure;

(3) age and gender are significant disclosure factors; (4) there is a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Based on these themes, a number of conclusions are drawn from this review. First, disclosure as a process is emphasized throughout contemporary research. Advances have been made in understanding these complex processes. However, the disclosure process over time--for example, how the first detection of CSA or attempts to disclose in childhood impact later disclosures--are not well understood. This is the result of the absence of a cohesive lifecourse perspective in investigations, although age consistently surfaces as significantly influencing CSA disclosure. Using a life-course perspective through the use of longitudinal studies is recommended.
The use of varied methodological designs, depending on the developmental stage of the victims/survivors, influences the data generated and subsequent findings. For example, most studies on children and youth are based on file reviews of cases that have been brought to the attention of authorities, or surveys, with only a few studies using interviewing of younger children. Therefore, there is less information available on process issues with children and youth. In contrast, research on adult populations largely favors the use of qualitative interview methods for retrospective inquiry producing important process findings. In addition, investigations have not yet captured the disclosure experiences of adults in the "emerging adult" stage given that adult studies have failed to recognized that the age range of 18-24, which is now considered a developmental phase defined by neurobiological developmental uniqueness. As well, late adulthood has not been given attention as shown by the absence of participants representing this age-group in current research (70þ). With a swelling geriatric population in North America, issues of historic CSA can be expected to surface and, with that, new disclosures. This trend is also anticipated due to attitudinal shifts that have presumably occurred over the last two generations about revealing such traumas and changing views about discussing sexual victimization.
Interview guides used in a number of studies intentionally probed for facilitators, producing notable findings. For example, one such finding focuses on the importance of creating a contextually supportive environment to promote disclosure across the life course. These include developing therapeutic relational contexts for disclosure by providing information about sexuality, sexual abuse, prevention programming, and by asking directly. Disclosures to professionals are positive outcomes of how therapeutic contexts work; however, for forensic purposes prompting such disclosures would be viewed as problematic in legal settings, seriously compromising testimonies for trial proceedings. This is one example that speaks to the structural barriers victims and survivors run up against time and time again. Facilitators that show evidence to promote disclosure in one domain (therapeutic) are seen to work against CSA survivors in another domain--such as legal settings when perpetrators face prosecution. Defense attorneys will use this as evidence that the disclosure was prompted, and therefore the disclosure is potentially seen as not credible. Broadcasting of

Alaggia et al.

281

the frequency of acquitted cases or rulings in favor of the perpetrator through media outlets, often sensationalized, become a further compounding barrier. Given the review findings, we conclude that barriers and facilitators to CSA disclosures are nuanced and clearly embedded within intrapersonal, interpersonal, environmental, contextual, and cultural domains--often interlocked in complex ways.
Limitations
Although comprehensive in nature with its life-course coverage, this review may be limited by its qualitative, thematic focus rather than providing an evaluative, quantitative accounting of CSA disclosures. However, because of the recent focus on disclosure processes, the authors chose a suitably compatible approach--qualitative in nature. As well, a traditional checklist approach in rating the studies was not employed for interrater reliability, since two of the authors hold expertise in CSA disclosure research and are well versed with the literature. This expertise, and through closely following a systematic review framework (Kiteley & Stogdon, 2014), assures that a thorough adjudication of the research literature was completed.
Implications for Research and Practice
These review findings have implications that can be useful in guiding future research and practice:
 Solid strides are being made in the use of a social-ecological framework to underpin investigations in the CSA disclosure investigations. Research efforts and practice considerations should continue in this vein. Investigating environmental factors and contextual and cultural forces is understudied, necessitating more research in these areas to more fully fill out understanding of CSA disclosure from a social-ecological perspective.
 There is good evidence that CSA disclosures are more likely to occur in a dialogical context--formal helping relationships but as well as other relationships such as peers and trusted adults. Providing information and education on topics of sexuality in general, and sexual abuse specifically, can help children and youth to disclose. Raising awareness and prevention programs can promote disclosures of sexual violence committed against children and youth.
 Goals of therapeutically supported disclosures (i.e., through therapy) may need to take precedence over forensic approaches, if well-being of child victims and adult survivors is to be made paramount. Legal processes may act to facilitate disclosures but can also act as barriers because of the negative outcomes experienced in the court process.
 Practitioners need to keep in mind that the legal system is lagging far behind in knowledge uptake of recent evidence on CSA disclosures so that victims and

survivors continue to be systemically and structurally disadvantaged in legal proceedings.  Health-care practitioners (i.e., child abuse pediatricians, family practice doctors, clinical nurse specialists, and public health nurses) should be made aware of the evidence in the CSA disclosure literature to create environments for facilitating therapeutic disclosures.  Given that age is a stable predictor of disclosure of CSA, more studies are needed that make use of a life-course perspective. More longitudinal studies are needed to better identify trends over different life stages.  The emerging young adult as a developmental age group needs specific investigation. Neuroscience research has established that ages 18-24 is a distinct developmental phase. Late adulthood is another life stage that deserves to be researched.  Gender needs to be more fully investigated in relation to impact on disclosure. Awareness that boys and girls have unique challenges and barriers in disclosing CSA should be paramount for practitioners.  Intervention planning should take note that disclosures increase when perpetrators no longer reside with victims, and this finding should be heeded by policy and law makers.  Shame, self-blame, and fear are intrapersonal factors that persistently emerge as barriers to CSA disclosures and warrant more research to understand how to redress these barriers for earlier disclosures.
Conclusion
There are still a substantial number of children and youth who are subjected to sexual abuse, despite preventative efforts. Just as concerning is the fact that many victims continue to suffer in silence as evidenced by the high numbers of delayed disclosure. These hidden cases should not be overlooked, and these victims should not be forgotten. Despite significant progress in bringing the issue of CSA to the forefront, improving facilitation of disclosure and increasing positive influences on disclosure processes are still critical in order to protect current and future generations of children and youth from the grave effects of sexual violence. Further, the focus should not be simply on strengthening and shoring up intrapersonal resources of victims to disclose but rather to change environmental conditions to create a more supportive and safer context for CSA victims and survivors to disclose.

Abstract Actinic keratosis (AK) is a clinical condition characterized by keratinocytic dysplastic lesions of the epidermis, affecting individuals chronically exposed to sunlight. Topical therapies allow the treatment of a whole area of affected skin and currently include diclofenac sodium gel, 5-fluorouracil cream, 5-fluorouracil and acetylsalicylic acid solution, imiquimod cream, and ingenol mebutate gel. Due to the comparable efficacy of 3% diclofenac, ingenol mebutate, and 3.75% imiquimod in treating AK multiple lesions, a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of cost-effectiveness of the three treatments was needed. A cost-efficacy analysis comparing 3% diclofenac sodium with ingenol mebutate and 3.75% imiquimod was performed. In this analysis, efficacy data were combined with quality-of-life measurement derived from previous studies as well as the costs associated with the management of these lesions in Italy. Patients' demographics and clinical characteristics were assumed to reflect those from the clinical studies considered.

Introduction
Actinic keratosis (AK) is a clinical condition characterized by keratinocytic dysplastic lesions of the epidermis, affecting individuals chronically exposed to sunlight, particularly with phototypes I-II according to the Fitzpatrick scale. Thanks to the many studies on AK's natural history, it is evident that up to 10% of lesions can degenerate in invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), with the risk increasing over time.1 Subclinical lesions of the photo-damaged area may degenerate as well in SCC according to the concept of "field cancerization."2
AK is primarily treated to prevent progression to SCC, for cosmetic reasons, and to eliminate symptoms such as itching and pain. With an approach focused on the photo-damaged skin instead of single

lesions, topical therapies have the advantage, over surgical or ablative therapies, of treating subclinical lesions as well, with recent evidence showing the latter also have the ability to degenerate into SCC.2

The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium is complex, with evidence showing that arachidonic acid metabolites are involved in the response of keratinocytes to ultra violet (UV) exposure and skin irritation and that the overactivation of cyclooxygenase enzymes (especially COX-2) is carcinogenic.3 The action of diclofenac also appears to induce neoplastic cell apoptosis, downregulation of angiogenesis,4 and the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma receptors which reduce the proliferation of neoplastic cells.5
Ingenol mebutate, another common topical treatment for AK derived from the plant Euphorbia peplus, induces necrosis of tumoral cells through immune system activation with a dual mechanism of action: at first lesion necrosis mainly through a proinflammatory cytokines cascade and then by neutrophil activation and antibody production.6
Imiquimod, a synthetic compound member of the imidazoquinolone family of drugs, is an immune modulator, acting via its binding to Toll-like Receptor 7 present on dendritic cells, macrophages, and monocytes, with a subsequent mounting immune response and the induction of Fas receptor on tumor cells.7
Due to the comparable efficacy of 3% diclofenac, ingenol mebutate, and 3.75% imiquimod in treating AK multiple lesions, a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of cost-effectiveness of the three treatments was needed.
A cost-efficacy analysis comparing 3% diclofenac sodium with ingenol mebutate and 3.75% imiquimod was performed. In this analysis, efficacy data were combined with quality-of-life measurement derived from previous studies as well as the costs associated with the management of these lesions in Italy. Patients' demographics and clinical characteristics were assumed to reflect those from the clinical studies considered.
Materials and methods
The following treatments have been considered in the analysis:
·· Diclofenac 3% gel in 2.5% hyaluronic acid (Solaraze®);
·· Ingenol mebutate gel 150g/g (Picato®); ·· Imiquimod 3.75% cream (Zyclara®).
A decisional tree model is presented based on the results of clinical studies of the three treatments

and the costs in the Italian National health care service. The model takes into account a period of 1year, evaluating treatment results including relapses, based on the availability of data in the published trials on topical treatments for AK.
The model uses the clinical results of these comparable treatments and the data obtained from the literature to estimate the quality-adjusted life years (QALY), expressing the results as incremental cost for QALY gained with 3% diclofenac, ingenol mebutate, and 3.75% imiquimod.
This analysis is carried out from the prospect of the Italian National Health Care Service (the prospect of the public payer), including only the health costs. For all the cited studies, patients provided written informed consent. This study was approved by our Institution Ethics Committee.
Parameters of the model
To identify the efficacy and recurrence rates of the three treatments, a review of the literature was carried out. Various clinical trials which describe the efficacy of diclofenac sodium,8-10 of ingenol mebutate,6 and of imiquimod11 were found.
Data of efficacy in terms of complete response and of recurrence for 3% diclofenac were taken from a phase-4, single-arm, multicenter, open-label study;8,9 data for ingenol mebutate were obtained from four multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies6 and data for imiquimod were obtained from one phase-III randomized, multicenter, placebocontrolled study11 and are shown in Table 1.
Figure 1 summarizes the complete response rate, the probability of adverse effects, and the probability of partial clearance of the lesions for the three treatments.
In order to convert the complete cure rates and the incidence of adverse effects for each QALY, the following utility values obtained from a recently published cost-utility analysis were applied.12
Data on the costs
Costs included in the model for each therapeutic option include the drug treatment and the medical visits (dermatologist or general practitioner), necessary for its administration both in the initial management of lesions and in the consequent recurrences, assuming for both treatments one initial visit to a dermatologist and one follow-up visit.

Concerning the cost of a dermatological visit, the Health Ministry reference document "Nomenclatore tariffario dell'assistenza specialistica ambulatoriale,"13 published on the Ministry website, updated 8 April 2013 does not specifically mention the cost of a dermatologist consult; for this reason, a general visit cost of 20.66, the same price for other specialist visits, is reported. In the sensitivity analysis, the cost of a private dermatological visit of 70-85, as reported in the price list of Regione Veneto (the most updated available online), was considered. Though in the analysis, no cost is associated with the onset of adverse events for the baseline analysis, as it was considered that they do not involve the use of resources specific for the treatments, the sensitivity analysis includes the cost of a medical visit in case of adverse effects.
Sensitivity analysis
In order to evaluate the influence of the assumptions of the analysis and the variability of the data employed, various univariate sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the influence on results of the relevant parameters employed. The probability of a complete response, the adverse effects rate, and the risk of recurrence were the variables considered. For most parameters, a ±50% variation was applied, which was considered to be significant and capable of reflecting large changes.
Results
The costs and health results of diclofenac sodium compared to ingenol mebutate and imiquimod in the treatment of AK were assessed for a period of 52weeks. The number of patients for each treatment arm was set to n=500. The model considered a comparison between 500 patients treated with diclofenac sodium, 500 patients with ingenol mebutate, and 500 patients with imiquimod, as shown in Figure 1. The results of the incremental

cost-efficacy relationship in the base scenario are shown in Table 2.
In case of recurrence, the cost of a new visit to a dermatologist and the cost of the second cycle of treatment were added to the total cost. During the 52 weeks of treatment, patients in the diclofenac sodium study arm reached a total cost of 49.492, including the cost of treatment and the direct cost of a first consultation with a dermatologist. For patients who received ingenol mebutate, the total cost was 69.597. For patients in the 3.75% imiquimod arm, the total cost was 70.426. Treatment cost for each patient was 99.0 for 3% diclofenac, 139.2 for ingenol mebutate, and 140.9 for 3.75% imiquimod.
Patients in the 3% diclofenac treatment arm had a total gain of 478 QALY, those in the ingenol mebutate arm had a gain of 470 QALY, and the 3.75% imiquimod arm had a gain of 467 QALY. When these results are calculated as QALY gained per patient, it translates into 0.956 QALY per patient treated with diclofenac sodium, 0.939 for subjects treated with ingenol mebutate, and 0.934 for subjects treated with imiquimod.
These small differences of QALY per patient can be considered to be clinically non-significant. Considering the results of QALY as equivalent, we could interpret the analysis as a cost minimization analysis.
This translates into a higher cost per patient of 40.2 for ingenol mebutate and of 41.9 for imiquimod, in order to obtain a benefit equivalent to that achieved with diclofenac sodium. This is shown in the cost-efficacy plan of Figure 2.
To consider for the uncertainty in different scenarios of the entry parameters of an economic model, a sensitivity analysis is useful to evaluate the impact of the variations in the baseline parameters on the results.
For this model, a univariate sensitivity analysis was performed by modifying the parameters listed in Table 3. All the results of the sensitivity analyses are shown with the profit net result.

clearance of the lesion for diclofenac sodium, ingenol mebutate, and imiquimod as well as the profit changes appeared to be less influencing factors.
Discussion
As treatment possibilities for AK are expanding in recent years, the choice of a treatment regimen must take into account patient preference, with respect to the therapy schedule, tolerance of side effects, and the costs of treatment. Other critical aspects are the features of AK lesions such as distribution, number, and thickness, as well as the patient's past history of treatment and recurrences.
Various clinical trials have shown the efficacy and safety of 3% diclofenac in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients,8,10 ingenol mebutate,6 and of 3.75% imiquimod.11
One important factor to consider is the duration of treatment, with a short course of therapy that may reduce the burden of treatment and increase patients' adherence. Ingenol mebutate in this regard is the most convenient treatment, allowing 2-3days application.6
Our pharmacoeconomic model demonstrated that in the Italian health care service, with comparable efficacy in terms of complete remission and QALY gained, diclofenac sodium is as effective and less expensive than either ingenol mebutate or imiquimod.12
Data of efficacy, at the base of this analysis, were taken from multicenter phase-III clinical trials, felt by the authors to approximate the actual real practice effectiveness of the three treatment arms. The study has a few limitations, the most important of which concerns the quality of the data entered into the model. The efficacy parameters, for example, are based on studies with a limited time frame and may therefore be inadequate for modeling treatment of a disease for a longer period.
A further limitation could be consistency in duration of reported adherence with 3% diclofenac sodium, ingenol mebutate, and 3.75% imiquimod. Indeed, a decrease in patient adherence has been reported with any topical therapy over time.14
Inclusion of further factors relating to decreased adherence would have penalized all formulations, with consequent underestimation of the adherence effect from a pharmacoeconomic standpoint, and reduced clarity concerning the potential role of the treatments in improving patient compliance with

therapy in clinical practice. Poor adherence inevitably leads to a poor treatment outcome. Prospective studies are needed to demonstrate the impact of interventions designed to enhance adherence and the effect of improved adherence on treatment outcomes.15
The inferior cost associated with diclofenac treatment should be an important consideration to take into account, considering the mildness of adverse effects for many topical treatments, the relapsing nature of AK and the long life expectancy of many AK patients.

Abstract: A 73-year-old man visited our hospital due to dyspnea and epigastralgia. His plasma brain natriuretic pep-
tide level was 1,205 pg/mL. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed ST segment depression in leads I, V5, and V6. Transthoracic echocardiography showed dilatation and severe hypokinesis of the left ventricle. Hypertrabeculation was observed at the septum, apex, and lateral wall. Delayed enhancement of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed a relatively low uptake of contrast agent at a large apical trabecula. After treatment with diuretics, follow-up echocardiography showed the disappearance of the controversial apical trabecula, which was later confirmed to have been a thrombus.

Introduction
Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a new and unclassified cardiomyopathy. It is characterized by increased left ventricular (LV) trabeculation and the presence of intertrabecular recesses communicating with the LV cavity (1).
We encountered a case of LV dysfunction complicated by apical LVNC, wherein a large apical trabecula disappeared following treatment for heart failure.
Case Report
A 73-year-old man visited our hospital due to dyspnea and epigastralgia with a history of daily alcohol consumption of 1 L of beer and 100 mL of distilled spirits. He had no personal or family history of LVNC, other cardiac disease, or neuromuscular disease.
On a physical examination, his blood pressure and pulse rate were 119/77 mmHg and 88 beats per minute, respectively. Auscultation revealed third and fourth apical heart

sounds. The blood oxygen saturation level measured by a pulse oximeter was 94%.
A blood analysis revealed impairment of the hepatic and renal functions. His International Normalized ratio of prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and plasma D-dimer level were 1.91, 32 seconds, and 13.6 ng/ mL, respectively. His plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level was 1,205 pg/mL.
Gastroscopy revealed an acute gastric mucosal lesion (AGML) that spread with oozing blood (Fig. 1). A 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrated left atrial enlargement and ST segment depression in leads I, V5, and V6 (Fig. 2a), and chest radiography showed bilateral pleural effusion (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, dilatation and severe hypokinesis of the left ventricle (LV end-diastolic dimension of 67 mm, end-systolic dimension of 59 mm, and ejection fraction of 28%) were observed on transthoracic echocardiography (Fig. 3). The LV wall thickness was normal (interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness was 10 and 9 mm, respectively). Hypertrabeculation was observed at the septum, apex, and lateral wall (Fig. 4, arrows and arrowheads). The

size of the large apical trabecula was 19×12 mm during diastole (Fig. 4, arrow). The apical trabecula had high echogenicity and an immobile structure and made contact with other trabeculae during the cardiac cycle, suggesting it was made of myocardium.
Pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography at the mitral inflow showed an E wave, A wave, and E wave deceleration time of 72 cm/s, 35 cm/s, and 155 ms, respectively. Pulsedwave tissue Doppler echocardiography at the septal mitral annulus showed an e' wave of 3.6 cm/s and E/e' ratio of 20.1. Continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography at tricuspid regurgitation showed an estimated peak pressure gradient of 46 mmHg. Color-flow imaging showed mild mitral regurgitation.

also showed hypertrabeculation at the septum, apex, and lateral wall (Fig. 5, arrow and arrowheads) with the distinct apical trabecula (19×8 mm) (Fig. 5, arrow). However, there was a relatively low uptake of contrast agent at this trabecula on delayed enhancement (DE)-CMR, suggesting it might not be a cardiac structure (Fig. 5, arrow) (2).
The patient was admitted to our hospital and treated with furosemide, spironolactone, imidapril, and lansoprazole. Twenty days later, follow-up two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography showed that the apical trabecula had almost disappeared (Fig. 6, asterisk) without any marked change in the LV wall motion. However, hypertrabeculation was still observed at the septum and the lateral wall, where the criteria for LVNC established by Chin et al. (3) and Jenni et al. (4) were fulfilled (Table) (Fig. 6, arrowheads). Continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography showed that the estimated pressure gradient at tricuspid regurgitation decreased to 27 mmHg. Blood analyses revealed improved transaminase (aspartate aminotransferase: from 138 to 50 IU/L) and BNP (from 1,205 to 453 pg/mL) levels (Fig. 7). Follow-up gastroscopy showed that the AGM was healed. Due to the appearance of drug-related skin rashes, drugs were suspended barring the initiation of Nexium (Fig. 7).
Forty days later, the plasma D-dimer levels had decreased to 2.0 ng/mL. DE-CMR showed that the apical thrombus had markedly diminished to 10×8 mm (Fig. 8, arrow). Hypertrabeculation at the septum and lateral wall also met the criteria for LVNC established by Petersen et al. (5) (Table). Cardiac catheterization showed no significant coronary artery stenosis (Fig. 9). Hemodynamic data obtained using the Swan-Ganz catheter showed Forrester subset IV cardiac dysfunction (pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 25 mmHg and

cardiac index of 2.18 L/min/m2). The patient was discharged on heart failure medication,
and follow-up was scheduled.

Discussion
The pathophysiology of LV hypokinesis in this patient is unclear. As coronary angiography showed no organic stenosis, the possible causes of hypokinesis include dilated cardi-

omyopathy (6) due to alcoholism or idiopathic causes. In the present case, hypertrabeculation at the septum and
lateral wall met the main criteria for LVNC established by Chin et al., Jenni et al., and Petersen et al. LVNC may be not only embryogenic but also acquired, including manifestations in young athletes, pregnant women, sickle cell anemia, and cardiomyopathy. As the present case had no personal or family history, LVNC might have been caused secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy.
At the apex, there was a large thrombus that appeared to be a trabecula on transthoracic echocardiography. The appearance of LV thrombus on transthoracic echocardiography has been reported to be variable and to depend on its age (7). For example, recent or actively forming thrombi may be echo-lucent, highly mobile, and disposed to protrude into the cavity. Older thrombi generally have a smooth surface and are sessile, laminated, and organized with higher

echogenicity than the LV wall. In patients with LVNC, LV thrombus may occasionally be observed within the trabeculations or at the recesses where blood flow is sluggish (8). Transthoracic echocardiography usually shows mobile and homogeneous echodense structures. In the present case, however, LV thrombus was observed at the apex where LVNC was absent. Furthermore, it was not mobile or echolucent but had figure of trabecula comparable to adjacent trabeculae.
DE-CMR revealed that the apical trabecula-like structure had low enhancement compared with other trabeculae, suggesting it was made of a thrombus. Forty days later, CMR

showed that the apical structure had markedly decreased in size. During this period, the patient did not complain of any signs of embolism or undergo CT to detect embolism.
Anticoagulant therapy has not been performed thus far, as LV trabeculation was not excluded, hemorrhagic AGML was present, and the PT-INR level was already elevated. It is possible that, in addition to LV hypokinesis, hypercoagulability following chronic liver dysfunction (9) or inflammation (10) might have caused LV thrombus formation. Anticoagulation therapy with edoxaban tosilate was started thereafter.
Conclusions
Left ventricular thrombus may come to resemble trabeculae in cases of LVNC. Diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and hypercoagulability may contribute to this trabecula-like thrombus formation.

OBJECTIVE -- The purpose of this study was to explore the association of metabolic syndrome and each of its components with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a general Italian elderly population.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Metabolic syndrome, diagnosed by National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality, was evaluated in 2,910 subjects aged 65 years of the Progetto Veneto Anziani (Pro.V.A.) Study during a mean follow-up time of 4.4 years.
RESULTS -- After multivariable adjustment, metabolic syndrome was associated with increased all-cause mortality in all subjects (hazard ratio 1.41 [95% CI 1.16 -1.72], P  0.001), among men (1.42 [1.06 -1.89], P  0.017), and among women (1.47 [1.13-1.91], P  0.004). High glucose in all subjects (1.27 [1.02-1.59], P  0.037) and in women (1.61 [1.16 -2.24], P  0.005) and low HDL cholesterol in women (1.48 [1.08 -2.02], P  0.014) were predictors of all-cause mortality, even independently of the interactions of different metabolic syndrome components. After multivariable adjustment, metabolic syndrome was also associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in all subjects (1.60 [1.17-2.19], P  0.003), among men (1.66 [1.00 -2.76], P  0.051), and among women (1.60 [1.06 -2.33], P  0.025). High glucose (2.17 [1.28 -3.68], P  0.004) and low HDL cholesterol (1.78 [1.07-2.95], P  0.026) among women predicted higher cardiovascular mortality.
CONCLUSIONS -- In this general Italian elderly population, among metabolic syndrome components, all-cause mortality is better predicted by high glucose in all subjects and in women and by low HDL cholesterol in women, whereas cardiovascular mortality is better predicted by high glucose and low HDL cholesterol in women.

M etabolic syndrome represents a cluster of metabolic abnormalities including central obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and high blood pressure, and it is an important predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (1- 4). However, the majority of these data are derived from populations of dif-

ferent races and of middle-aged and young subjects, mostly men. Ford (2) suggested that the strength of the association between metabolic syndrome and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality may be higher in certain population subgroups, such as women and elderly subjects. However, in the Health, Aging, and

Body Composition (Health ABC) study, no significant difference in mortality was observed among subjects aged 70 -79 years with and without metabolic syndrome (5). In elderly Finns, metabolic syndrome predicted cardiovascular but not all-cause mortality (6). Also, in Italian elderly individuals metabolic syndrome was not independently associated with total mortality (7), whereas it increased the risk of cardiovascular mortality only in men (8).
The effects of metabolic syndrome in elderly individuals represent a crucial point because elderly populations worldwide are growing progressively, and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome increases with age, always with a higher rate in women than in men (7-10). In a longitudinal adult population- based cohort study, the increased risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality of subjects with metabolic syndrome was explained by high blood pressure and glucose levels, among components of the syndrome (11). In the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging (ILSA), among metabolic syndrome features, low HDL cholesterol in men and high glucose in women were significant predictors of cardiovascular mortality (8).
Therefore, another important issue is whether metabolic syndrome as a whole is a better predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in comparison with its individual components (12). In the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), the total and cardiovascular mortality higher risk due to metabolic syndrome was confined to subjects having hypertension and/or high glucose (13). Lately, results from two prospective studies in elderly individuals showed that metabolic syndrome and its components have a strong association with type 2 diabetes but no association with incident cardiovascular events (14).
With this background, the objective of the present study was to explore the association of metabolic syndrome and each of its individual components with

all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a general Italian elderly population.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The study population included 3,099 age- and sex-stratified subjects (1,245 men and 1,854 women) of the Progetto Veneto Anziani (Pro.V.A.) Study, an observational cohort study of the Italian population aged 65 years living in two geographical areas of northeastern Italy (Camposampiero and Rovigo) near the city of Padua in the Veneto region (15). The study population represented 10% of the target population, which was randomly drawn from health district registries, including the entire resident population. The sampling frame included all subjects aged 65 years who were residents in one of the two study centers at the beginning of the cross-sectional phase; all subjects were 100% Caucasian. No exclusion criteria were used. The sampling strategy consisted of an age- (65-74, 75- 84, and 85 years) and sex-stratified random sample designed to keep the male-to-female ratio at 2:3 and to oversample the oldest possible age-group. Oversampling was performed to provide stable estimates of conditions with low prevalence. The overall response rate to the visit clinic was 77% for men and 64% for women. Subjects living in the community and in nursing homes (3.5%) were included.
The baseline assessment was carried out from 1995 to 1997 as described elsewhere (15). This study includes information about mortality rates per personyears assessed for a mean  SD of 4.4  1.1 years of follow-up.
Lifestyle factors Information on educational level, socioeconomic condition, physical activity, and smoking status was collected during an in-person interview. Educational level was verified by asking participants to quantify the total number of years of school attended; then the educational level was categorized as 5 versus 5 years of school. The socioeconomic condition was categorized as monthly income 500  or 500 . Physical activity was categorized as 4 or 4 h/week of at least moderate physical activity (brisk walking, biking, swimming, dancing, or physical exercising). Smoking status was categorized as "never," "former" (for at least 1 year in the past), and "current" smoking.

Clinical and laboratory data BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Waist circumference was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm using a plastic tape measure while the subject was standing, and it was measured as the minimum abdominal circumference between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus. Blood pressure, measured using the Hypertension Detection Follow-up Program protocol (16), was the mean of three readings while the subject was supine. A venous blood sample was obtained from 99% of participants, after an overnight fast, for biochemical determinations, performed at the central laboratory of the city hospital by standard and quality-controlled procedures. LDL cholesterol was calculated by the Friedewald equation, except when triglycerides were 400 mg/dl.
Disease adjudication As described (15,16), disease presence at baseline was determined by boardcertified study physicians who examined all of the clinical information collected for each participant in the study, including disease history, self-reported symptoms by standardized questionnaires, MiniMental State Examination score, medical and hospital records, blood assays, physical examination, medication use, X-ray film readings, standardized electrocardiogram, and ankle/brachial index. Preexisting major diseases included any of the following: coronary heart diseases (angina and myocardial infarction), cardiovascular diseases (congestive heart failure, stroke, and peripheral artery disease), and major diseases (diabetes, chronic pulmonary and kidney diseases, cancer, and/or cognitive impairment).
Metabolic syndrome was identified by National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria (17). According to this definition, subjects with metabolic syndrome were identified by any combination of three or more of the following alterations: abdominal obesity (waist circumference 102 cm for men or 88 cm for women), elevated plasma triglycerides (150 mg/dl), low HDL cholesterol (40 mg/dl for men or 50 mg/dl for women), high blood pressure (130/85 mmHg) or antihypertensive treatment, or high fasting plasma glucose (110 mg/dl) or a previous physician diagnosis of diabetes or a fasting plasma glucose 126 mg/dl.

Mortality surveillance Follow-up time was calculated as the time from baseline to death or censoring. A copy of the official death certificate of all deceased participants was obtained. The main cause of death reported in the death certificate was classified by expert nosologists according to ICD-9. Cardiovascular mortality was defined by codes from 390 to 459. Mortality rates were obtained by dividing the number of deaths occurring during the study by the accumulated number of person-years. Follow-up was complete for 99.3% of participants.
Statistical analysis To generalize the Pro.V.A. sample to the general population of the two geographical areas, a set of weights was defined according to the sex and age distribution of the reference population (Italy, Census 1991) and to the sample fraction. Data are means  SD for quantitative measures and frequency percentages for all discrete variables. Comparisons between means were evaluated using generalized linear models. Levene's test was performed to test the homoscedasticity of variances, and when its assumption was violated, Welch's ANOVA was used. The differential distribution of sex, smoking status, physical activity, socioeconomic status, selected diseases, and metabolic syndrome components was analyzed by 2 test.
The association of metabolic syndrome (present versus absent) and each of its components (individual and combined components as dichotomized variables) with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was evaluated by Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for age (as a continuous variable) and sex, including sequentially in the model potential explanatory and confounding variables as covariates (BMI, albumin, and LDL cholesterol were included as continuous variables). In the models testing the associations with allcause and cardiovascular mortality of metabolic syndrome components all together as covariates, metabolic syndrome was introduced as a proxy for the interactions of individual factors. The assumption of proportionality was assessed through the analysis of Schoenfeld residuals of the covariates introduced in the models. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CI were calculated to estimate the strength of the association. Subjects affected by prevalent cardiovascular disease at baseline (angina, myocardial infarc-

RESULTS -- Of the 3,099 subjects in the baseline cohort, information on metabolic syndrome diagnosis was available for 2,910 individuals (94%), and 1,135 of them (300 of 1,174 men and 835 of 1,736 women) were affected by metabolic syndrome (not weighted data). Compared with subjects without the syndrome, those affected by metabolic syndrome were more frequently women and had higher waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, BMI, and total and LDL cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol levels (Table 1). Subjects with metabolic syn-

drome were less often former and current smokers, less educated, and less physically active and had lower monthly income than those without metabolic syndrome. Among different metabolic syndrome components, high blood pressure was the most common, followed in order by increased waist circumference, high triglycerides, high glucose, and low HDL cholesterol levels. Subjects with metabolic syndrome were more often affected by coronary heart, cardiovascular, and other major chronic diseases.
During 4.4 years of follow-up, 632 deaths occurred, 246 among subjects with metabolic syndrome (90 men and 156 women) and 386 among those without the syndrome (251 men and 135 women) (not weighted data). Women with metabolic syndrome consistently had a higher all-cause mortality rate than those without metabolic syndrome, whereas no significant difference in mor-

tality rate was observed among men (Table 2).
Cox proportional hazards regression models confirmed the differential effect by sex in the association between metabolic syndrome and all-cause mortality and revealed a significant sex by metabolic syndrome interaction (P  0.000); therefore, models were also stratified by sex (Table 2). After adjustments for age and sex, the risk of all-cause mortality was higher among all subjects with metabolic syndrome. Confounding factors and diseases associated with increased mortality risk were sequentially included in the models, increasing the strength of the association between metabolic syndrome and all-cause mortality. Metabolic syndrome was significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality after adjustments for age, sex, smoking, physical activity, major diseases, BMI, albumin, and LDL cholesterol levels in all subjects (HR 1.41 [95% CI 1.16 -1.72], P  0.001),

among men (1.42 [1.06 -1.89], P  0.017), and among women (1.47 [1.13- 1.91], P  0.004), respectively. Models including individual metabolic syndrome components did show a significant association between metabolic syndrome and all-cause mortality for low HDL cholesterol (1.34 [1.09 -1.65], P  0.005) and high glucose (1.37 [1.13-1.65], P  0.001) in all subjects and particularly in women (low HDL cholesterol versus not 1.48 [1.14 -1.92], P  0.003; high glucose versus not 1.65 [1.27-2.15], P  0.000), but not in men. In a model considering all metabolic syndrome components together as covariates and metabolic syndrome as a proxy for the interactions of individual factors, high glucose in all subjects and in women and low HDL cholesterol only in women were significant predictors of all-cause mortality (Table 2).
Subjects affected by angina, myocardial infarction, and stroke at baseline (n  316) were excluded from the cardiovascular mortality analysis. During 4.4 years of follow-up, 230 cardiovascular deaths occurred, 96 in subjects with metabolic syndrome (29 men and 67 women) and 134 in subjects without the syndrome (73 men and 61 women) (not weighted data). Both men and women with metabolic syndrome had significant higher rates of

cardiovascular mortality compared with subjects without the syndrome (Table 3).
The differential effect by sex in the association between metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular mortality was tested in the proportional hazards models, which revealed a substantial sex by metabolic syndrome interaction (P  0.060); therefore, these models were also stratified by sex (Table 3). We found an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality among all subjects with metabolic syndrome after adjustment for age and sex. Confounding and cardiovascular risk factors were sequentially included in the models, increasing the strength of the association between metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular mortality. Metabolic syndrome was associated with increased cardiovascular mortality after adjustments for age, sex, smoking, LDL cholesterol, physical activity, and BMI in all subjects and also among men and women, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, including in the model the previous diagnosis of diabetes, metabolic syndrome was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in all subjects but not in men and women separately. Models including individual metabolic syndrome components showed a significant association between cardiovascular mortality and high glucose in all subjects (HR 1.59

[95% CI 1.18 -2.13], P  0.002). In the sex-stratified analysis, a significant association of cardiovascular mortality was found with high triglycerides (1.74 [1.08 -2.78], P  0.021) among men and with low HDL cholesterol (1.62 [1.07- 2.45], P  0.023) and high glucose (2.03 [1.36 -3.02], P  0.001) among women. In a model considering all metabolic syndrome components together as covariates and metabolic syndrome as a proxy for the interactions of individual factors, high glucose and low HDL cholesterol among women were significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (Table 3).
CONCLUSIONS -- In this general Italian elderly population, metabolic syndrome predicts all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in both men and women, but not all of its individual components significantly contribute to the increased risk of mortality. In fact, after a 4.4-year follow-up, all-cause mortality was significantly predicted by high glucose in all subjects and in women and by low HDL cholesterol only in women. Among metabolic syndrome components, high glucose and low HDL cholesterol in women also significantly predicted the risk of cardiovascular mortality.

Studies in American (5), Finnish (6), and Italian (7) elderly subjects demonstrated that metabolic syndrome was not an independent predictor of total mortality. However, the CHS recently demonstrated that metabolic syndrome predicted a 22% higher all-cause mortality in older adults and with the use of different criteria results were similar (13).
Our results clearly show that metabolic syndrome is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in subjects overall, even after adjustment for important factors, such as educational level, socioeconomic condition, smoking status, physical activity, and several chronic major diseases known to be associated with mortality in elderly individuals. After adjustment for all of these factors, the increased risk of all-cause mortality in our elderly population was higher than that found in older adults of the CHS; however, our follow-up time was shorter. A longer follow-up could attenuate the effect of metabolic syndrome on mortality because of the interaction with other environmental and lifestyle factors and chronic diseases. However, not all individual components of metabolic syndrome contribute to the increased risk of total mortality, which is significantly predicted by high glucose in all subjects and

by high glucose and low HDL cholesterol in women.
The differences between men and women can be explained by several factors: our study population includes a large cohort with a sex distribution (60% women) which reflects that of the Italian elderly population; the prevalence of metabolic syndrome after age 75 years decreases in men whereas it increases in women; women more frequently had two or more components of the metabolic syndrome compared with men; and women showed a higher prevalence of high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol than men (10).
To our knowledge, no previous studies have demonstrated that, among metabolic syndrome features, low HDL cholesterol is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in elderly subjects, even independently of the interaction of different metabolic syndrome components. In a previous report, low HDL cholesterol, combined with low albumin, was associated with the highest risk of allcause mortality in older subjects (18). As with albumin, low HDL cholesterol seems to be a reliable marker for poor health status and chronic diseases, and its better prognostic value could be explained by impairment of the antioxidant and anti-

inflammatory roles of HDL cholesterol (18,19).
Recently in the CHS, only high blood pressure and high glucose, among metabolic syndrome components, predicted higher mortality in older adults (13). Also, similar observations were reported in an Italian adult population (11). A possible reason that high blood pressure was not a predictor of mortality in our population is its overall high prevalence in our subjects.
We also confirmed the nonpredictive role of waist circumference and triglycerides. In our study, the waist circumference component is common in subjects without metabolic syndrome, and it is a matter of discussion whether overweight and/or modest adiposity is a risk factor in elderly individuals (20). Triglycerides may be nonpredictive because of their strong physiological relation with HDL cholesterol.
Regarding cardiovascular mortality among women, our findings confirm the strong impact of diabetes, even after adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors (21). Moreover, a meta-analysis showed that women might have a greater cardiovascular disease risk associated with hyperglycemia than men even among subjects without diabetes, sug-

gesting that high glucose may abolish the protection on cardiovascular disease risk of women, particularly in elderly individuals (22). Moreover, there is accumulating evidence that later in life estrogen deficiency in association with aging processes might promote inflammation and vascular dysfunction, making women more vulnerable to atherosclerosis than men (23).
Our results confirm that low HDL cholesterol is a better cardiovascular mortality predictor than other lipid risk factors in older populations (24,25). The HDL cholesterol reduction results from modifications in HDL cholesterol composition and metabolism, which may impair the antiatherogenic properties of HDL cholesterol, making HDL cholesterol particles proinflammatory, less antioxidant, and less effective on reverse cholesterol transport (19). In addition, high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol are associated with more atherogenic small, dense LDL particles (19).
A potential limitation of our study is that it included only elderly subjects without an age limit and therefore with a limited survival. Nevertheless, it has been postulated that the strength of the association between metabolic syndrome and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality may be higher in certain subgroups such as elderly subjects (2). Other potential limitations are the relative short follow-up period and the evaluation of only fatal events related to metabolic syndrome.
The strengths of our study are the large number of deaths due to old age and the cardiovascular mortality investigated in subjects without previous cardiovascular diseases. Other important features are the design based on community-dwelling Italian older adults, who are truly representative of a general elderly population, the thorough clinical diagnosis of diseases, and the assessment of several cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, the Pro.V.A. Study collected extensive baseline data on educational level, socioeconomic conditions, and lifestyle factors that allowed us to adjust for several confounding variables.
In summary, our findings suggest the importance of considering individual risk factors rather than their combination in the metabolic syndrome in older individuals and that in elderly subjects clinicians should focus on simple fasting plasma glucose and HDL cholesterol measurements rather than on diagnosis of metabolic syndrome per se.

Phosphorylation and SCF-mediated degradation regulate CREB-H transcription of metabolic targets

ABSTRACT CREBH, an endoplasmic reticulum-anchored transcription factor, plays a key role in regulating secretion and in metabolic and inflammatory pathways, but how its activity is modulated remains unclear. We examined processing of the nuclear active form and identified a motif around S87-S90 with homology to DSG-type phosphodegrons. We show that this re gion is subject to multiple phosphorylations, which regulate CREB-H stability by targeting it to the SCFFbw1a E3 ubiquitin ligase. Data from phosphatase treatment, use of phosophospecific antibody, and substitution of serine residues demonstrate phosphorylation of candidate ser ines in the region, with the core S87/S90 motif representing a critical determinant promoting proteasome-mediated degradation. Candidate kinases CKII and GSK-3b phosphorylate CREBH in vitro with specificities for different serines. Prior phosphorylation with GSK-3 at one or more of the adjacent serines substantially increases S87/S90-dependent phosphorylation by CKII. In vivo expression of a dominant-negative Cul1 enhances steady-state levels of CREBH, an effect augmented by Fbw1a. CREB-H directly interacts with Fbw1a in a phosphorylationdependent manner. Finally, mutations within the phosphodegron, when incorporated into the full-length protein, result in increased levels of constitutively cleaved nuclear protein and in creased transcription and secretion of a key endogenous target gene, apolipoprotein A IV.

synthesis, membrane incorporation, and constitutive and regulated secretion (McClellan et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 2010; Brodsky and Skach, 2011; Guerriero and Brodsky, 2012; Cnop et al., 2012). To maintain function and capacity, the ER possesses many integrated feedback systems that monitor diverse processes at the ER and regulate adaptive responses to alterations in the extracellular and intracellular environments. One such system involves intricate ER-nuclear signaling by which demand or perturbation is sensed at the ER via dedicated transmembrane transcription factors and relayed to the nucleus via processes including regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). Examples include the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which control fatty acid and sterol homeostasis (Goldstein et al., 2006), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), one of the components that regulate the unfolded protein response (Schroder and Kaufman, 2005; Ron and Walter, 2007). In both cases, these factors are retained in the ER by sensors of the particular pathways and, in response to fluctuation in those pathways, released from the ER, transported to the Golgi, and cleaved by resident enzymes S1P and S2P (Nohturfft et al., 1999; Ye et al., 2000; Yang et al., 2002; Shen et al., 2005). This releases the N-terminal products, which traffic to the nucleus to effect appropriate transcriptional responses.

The identification of the cAMP response element-binding protein 3 (CREB3) family of ER-anchored basic leucine zipper (bZip) transmembrane factors now extends the class of factors regulated by RIP and the spectrum of integrated systems involved in maintaining ER function (reviewed in Bailey and O'Hare, 2007). CREB3 factors are an ancient group, closely related to but distinct from ATF6 (Barbosa et al., 2013). Humans possess five related members: CREB3/Luman, CREB3L1/OASIS, CREB3L2/BBF2H7, CREB3L3/ CREBH, and CREB3L4/CREB4/AIbZIP/ (Lu et al., 1997; Honma et al., 1999; Omori et al., 2001; Cao et al., 2002; Qi et al., 2002; Storlazzi et al., 2003; for ease of reference to previous work, the familiar names are used here rather than the systematic CREB3 nomenclature). Recent data from knockout animal models show that CREB3 proteins play critical roles in metabolic homeostasis, cell differentiation, and inflammation (Zhang et al., 2006, 2012; Murakami et al., 2009; Saito et al., 2009, 2012; Lee et al., 2010; Asada et al., 2012). They are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and control overlapping but distinct physiological responses involving the ER. For example, old astrocyte specifically induced substance (OASIS) is preferentially expressed in osteoblast and astrocytes, and OASISdeficient mice exhibit a delay in osteoblast maturation and severe osteopenia (Murakami et al., 2009). OASIS plays additional roles, including in pancreatic beta cell secretion (Vellanki et al., 2010) and goblet cell differentiation in the large intestine (Asada et al., 2012). BBF2H7 is expressed in many cell types and plays a critical role in chondrocytes during chondrogenesis, inducing expression of targets, including Sec23a, a secretory coat protein involved in transport from the ER to the Golgi (Saito et al., 2009).
CREB-H is found mainly in cells of the liver and small intestine and has been shown to be a key factor in metabolic homeostasis, involved in maintaining normal levels of lipids and triglycerides (Lee et al., 2011; Lee, 2012; Zhang et al., 2012) and in hepatic glucose metabolism (Lee et al., 2010; Chanda et al., 2011). CREB-H target genes strongly overlap with those of OASIS and BBF2H7, including Sec23, Sec24, and extracellular matrix components, but also encompass distinct specific physiological targets in de novo lipogenesis, triglyceride and cholesterol biosynthesis, fatty acid elongation and oxidation, lipolysis, and lipid transport (Lee et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012; Barbosa et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2014). CREB-H promotes increased expression and secretion of specific cargoes, including apolipoproteins A I and A IV and phospholipase A 2. Lack of CREBH expression in the liver results in elevated levels of fatty acids and triglycerides due to the failure to secrete these apolipoproteins and enzyme complexes, which otherwise help suppress plasma levels of these metabolites (Luebke-Wheeler et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2011; Lee, 2012; Zhang et al., 2012). Stimuli including saturated fatty acids, insulin, and an atherogenic high-fat diet promote CREB-H activation, leading to increased target gene transcription (Danno et al., 2010; Gentile et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2010, 2011; Zhang et al., 2012). Moreover, multiple nonsynonomous mutations in CREB3-H have been identified in humans with hypertriglyceridemia (Lee et al., 2011). Nevertheless, despite the recent demonstration of key physiological roles for CREB3 proteins, we have little mechanistic understanding of the signaling pathways involved or how their activities are controlled.
Protein stability represents a major determinant of transcription factor abundance and the magnitude and longevity of a signaling response. Here we examine features of the nuclear stability of one of the CREB3 members, CREB-H. Many transcription factors are short-lived proteins and are stabilized in response to specific signals (reviewed by Muratani and Tansey, 2003; Dhananjayan et al., 2005; Westermarck, 2010). For example, SREBP1 is regulated by multiple

positive and negative phosphorylation events in response to metabolic cues. Phosphorylation by AKT promotes the release of SREBP- SCAP to the Golgi (Du et al., 2006; Yellaturu et al., 2009) and also promotes stabilization of the nuclear cleaved form, antagonizing GSK-3, which constitutively phosphorylates nuclear SREBP1, promoting its ubiquitination by a member of the Skp1/cullin/F-box proteins (SCF) class of E3 ubiquitin ligases and proteasomal degradation (Hirano et al., 2001, 2003; Sundqvist et al., 2005; BengoecheaAlonso and Ericsson, 2009). Generally, phosphorylation-dependent recognition of substrate proteins by ubiquitin- conjugating complexes such as the SCF E3 ligase complexes and antagonism of that phosphorylation by further modification of either the substrate or the various kinases play a fundamental role in modulating the abundance and/or localization of transcription factors and thus the kinetics and duration of their activity (Muratani and Tansey, 2003; Dhananjayan et al., 2005). F-box proteins of the SCF complexes frequently bind their substrates at motifs termed phosphodegrons. The prototypical F-box factor, Fbw1a, binds the consensus degron Asp-Ser-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Ser (in which Xaa is any amino acid and both Ser residues are phosphorylated; Pickart and Eddins, 2004; Frescas and Pagano, 2008; Skaar et al., 2013). Phosphodegrons can be phosphorylated by a single kinase in multiple residues or alternatively by multiple kinases that phosphorylate different residues or by use of priming kinases, which adds an increased complexity to substrate recognition by F-box proteins.
In this study, we examine degradation of nuclear CREBH and its interactions with the ubiquitin-proteasome system, providing insights into the regulatory mechanisms that modulate its transcriptional response in the nucleus. We identify a conserved motif, DSGIS, in the N-terminus of CREBH and propose that it acts as a phosphodegron, mediating SCF complex binding by the specific F-box factor TrCP (Fbw1a) and promoting proteasome degradation of CREBH. We demonstrate that serine-to-alanine substitutions (DSGIS to DAGIA) within this motif significantly increase stability of the nuclear CREBH product and that expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Cul1 (the scaffold component of the SCF ubiquitin E3 ligase), particularly with coexpression of the TrCP component, increases steady-state levels of CREBH. Sequential phosphorylation in vitro by GSK-3b and CKII kinases results in efficient DSG-dependent phosphorylation of CREB-H. Moreover, in vivo the addition of the drug CHIR99021, a potent inhibitor of GSK3, substantially increases levels of nuclear CREB-H. Serine-to-alanine substitutions within this motif not only retained but had a pronounced stimulatory effect on CREBH functional activity in a transcription reporter assay, consistent with enhanced stabilization. Finally, we place these same serine substitutions in the context of full-length CREB-H and demonstrate increased transcription and secretion of a main endogenous physiological target, the apolipoprotein A IV (ApoA IV). These results are discussed in the overall context of CREB-H regulation and other family members in the coordination of signaling events during ER homeostatic responses.
RESULTS Phosphorylation of CREB-H and identification of a conserved serine-rich motif The cleaved form of CREB-H, termed CREBHTMC (see schematic in Figure 1a) represents the mature S2P-cleaved N-terminal product and is virtually exclusively located in the nucleus (Bailey et al., 2007). It migrates on SDS-PAGE gels as a series of bands that comigrate precisely with the major forms produced after brefeldin A-induced cleavage of the full-length ER-associated form (Figure 1b, lanes 1-3). The fastest-migrating form of CREBHTMC is

mutant, again there was a significant shift in migration, with this mutant migrating similarly to the 3S alone but now with even more increased abundance (Figure 2f, lanes 1, 2, and 4). A summary of the total steady-state levels observed in experiments throughout the course of this work is given in Figure 2g, showing increases of >10-fold for 3S+DSG, significant increases of five- to sixfold for DSG and a modest 1- to twofold for 3S. Furthermore, to estimate relative stability, we analyzed each of the wt and mutant proteins for abundance after cycloheximide treatment by quantitative Western blotting using fluorescent secondary antibodies and laser scanning densitometry (Figure 3, a and b). The results are consistent with the steady-state levels, showing an increase in half-life of the 3S mutant (83 min) over the wt (47 min) and more significant increases for the DSG (102 min) and 3S+DSG mutants (167 min). In addition, in localization studies, we found virtually exclusively nuclear accumulation for the wt protein and increased cell numbers and/or intensity for each of the mutants, with the greatest increase being for the combined mutant 3Sd+DSG (Figure 2h). The results were consistent with the more quantitative assessment obtained from the Western blot analyses.
The shift in migration of the 3S mutant (and the 3S+DSG mutant) to yield a more abundant species comigrating with the N species (i.e., equivalent to dephosphorylated wt) is consistent with phosphorylation at one or more of the mutated serines. Indeed S73, when individually mutated to alanine, showed a mobility shift, although not as great as the combined 3S mutant (Figure 4c, lanes 2 and 3). The 3S mutant had only a minor effect on overall abundance but did so both in the wt context and when combined with the DSG mutant. However, the DSG mutant by itself clearly had a very pronounced stabilizing effect in the context of both wt protein (Figure 2f, lanes 1 and 3) and the 3S mutant (lanes 2 and 4). Because the majority of 3S+DGS mutant species migrated above the unmodified

N species, other phosphorylation sites apart from the five serines mutated in 3S+DGS are likely to occur. Consistent with this, phosphatase treatment of 3S+DSG further increased its migration to a form more completely comigrating with the N species (unpublished data).
To support the proposal for phosphorylation within this region, we synthesized a series of peptides containing phosphoserine in place of serine at the appropriate position in the attempt to generate antibodies specific for pS73, pS81, and pS87 (summarized in Figure 4a). In the event, the peptide for pS87 failed to generate any antibody that detected CREB-H, nor did other peptides designed for the S87-S90 region. However, the antibodies for both peptides at S73 and S81 were reactive with results that strongly supported the proposal for phosphorylation at these residues, as described later.
Anti-SV5 is a mouse monoclonal antibody, and the anti-peptide antibodies are rabbit, allowing simultaneous detection of the various species on the same blots using fluorochrome-labeled secondary antibodies. This facilitated conclusions about phosphorylation of the mutant species that would be difficult to obtain from standard chemiluminescence assays. CREB-HTMC was expressed and analyzed untreated or after treatment with  phosphatase on a single membrane using anti-SV5 antibody to detect the total population (green channel) and in parallel with anti-pS73 antibody (red channel; Figure 4b). As described earlier, we detected the lower species N and upper doublet N1 and closely migrating bands (lanes 2, SV5, and merged). The anti-pS73 antibody selectively detected the upper species N1 with virtually no detection of the N species (lane 2, pS73). Furthermore upon phosphatase treatment, we saw the loss of the N1 species and a corresponding increase in the N species when detected by the SV5 antibody (lane 3, SV5) but almost complete loss of all species and virtually no detection of the increased N species when using the anti-pS73 antibody (lane 3, pS73; quantitation in

(c) Western blotting of cells expressing each of the mutants as indicated using anti-SV5 epitope antibody to detect the total levels of the proteins and anti-pS73 to detect the phosphorylated forms. An asterisk indicates background bands detected with the anti-pS73 antibody. Whereas the anti-pS73 antibody detected multiple species of the wt protein, these showed a shift in relative levels from the species detected by SV5. Of greater importance, the anti-pS73 antibody completely failed to detect the mutant with a single S  A change at position 73, despite similar levels of the protein. Other conclusions are as discussed in the text. (d) Identical to c, but now using anti-pS81 antibody and anti-SV5.

Supplemental Figure S1a). The conversion from N1 to N was prevented by inclusion of phosphatase inhibitors (lane 4, SV5). Of interest, we noticed a slight shift in ratio of detection in the untreated sample (lanes 2) within the upper N1 species by the anti-pS73 antibody, which reacted slightly preferentially against the lower part of this doublet compared with SV5 antibody, better observed in the merged image showing yellow and green in this region (lane 2). Although this shift in ratio of the upper species is not key to the conclusions here, the observation adds weight to our interpretations (see later description and Discussion). What is clear from these data is that the anti-pS73 antibody detects the upper modified form of the protein, and this detection is completely lost upon phosphatase treatment. Combined with the mobility shift detected by SV5 upon phosphatase treatment and the mobility shift upon mutation, the data provide strong evidence for phosphorylation at S73. We repeated these phosphatase experiments for the anti-pS81 antibody with similar results (unpublished data; see also Figure 4, c and d).
To supply additional evidence that the anti-pS73 and anti-pS81 antibodies showed strong preference for the phosphorylated form of the protein, we expressed wt CREB-HTMC or single-substitution mutants S73A or S81A and used the anti-epitope tag antibody (SV5) or the anti-pS73 or anti-pS81 antibodies to detect phosphorylated species. Mutation of the single S73A increased mobility detectably (Figure 4c, SV5 lanes 2 and 3), although with no reproducible effect on abundance. In this blot, the anti-pS73 antibody detection of mul-

tiple upper species for the wt protein could be more easily seen, with a slightly different ratio of the closely migrating N1 species for the two antibodies (lane 2, single and merged channels). The single substitution of S73A substantially reduced (<10% remaining) detection by anti-pS73 (lanes 2 and 3) while having no or little effect on the S81A mutant (lane 4). Quantitative analysis of the relative detection of the wt and mutants is shown in Supplemental Figure S1b. Our results indicate that the major reactivity of the anti-pS73 antibody is against CREB-H species phosphorylated on S73.
We performed a similar analysis for the anti-pS81 antibody (Figure 4d). The S81A mutation had little effect on migration rate or overall abundance (SV5, lanes 2 and 4). The anti-pS81 antibody again detected the wt protein, while there was highly reduced detection of the S81A mutant (anti-pS81, lanes 2 and 4). There was residual detection by the anti-pS81 antibody for the S81A mutant, indicating a minor cross-reactivity to nonphosphorylated species. Nonetheless the results are again consistent with the anti-pS81 detecting mainly phosphorylated species. Noted that this antibody also failed to detect the S73A single mutant (lanes 2 and 3). One possible interpretation of this result is that phosphorylation on S81 is itself dependent on S73, possibly as a priming phosphorylated site. This proposal is consistent with results of the following sections examining candidate kinases that phosphorylate CREB-H.
Although we could not confirm phosphorylation at S87 and S90 by this route, results in the following section are also consistent with

are themselves subject to priming at addi-

Equal amounts of purified GST, GST-wt, or GST-DSG protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads were incubated without (-) or with (+) purified GSK-3 and CKII for 30 min before the addition of the Fbw1a- transfected soluble extracts. After further incubation, the beads were isolated, washed extensively, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for Fbw1a and for GST fusion protein in the pull-down (Fbw1a and GST panels). The input sample (Inp) represents 1/50 of the total input, and 1/5 of the pull-down material was analyzed in each case. Equal amounts of total GST-fusion proteins were incubated in each case and present in the pull-down as detected by anti-GST antibody (bottom GST panel). Specific interaction with wt was observed but only after phosphorylation by GSK-3 and CKII. In parallel, no significant interaction was observed for the GST control or for GST-DSG.
tested the effects of the GSK inhibitor LiCl on the expression levels of CREB-H from the relatively weak thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (Figure 8a). Treatments for either 1 h (lanes 1-3) or 2 h (lanes 4-6) resulted in significant increases of approximately threefold in CREBH over those seen in untreated cells or cells treated with the control (NaCl). It would be predicted that the relative levels of phosphorylated CREB-H would decrease accompanying the increase in protein abundance. However, in these experiments with relatively weak expression from the TK promoter, levels of detection with the phosphospecific antibodies were too low for easy detection. We repeated these experiments using the stronger cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (Figure 8b), and in this case, whereas the increase in total abundance was slightly lower, we could now analyze pS73 phosphorylation (lanes 3 and 4) in parallel. In this case, whereas S73 was still phosphorylated in the presence of the inhibitor, we observed a decline in relative ratio of the phosphorylated species to the total levels of protein (see also Supplemental Figure S2b). Moreover, LiCl treatment was accompanied by appearance of a more rapidly migrating species within the upper N1 species (SV5, arrow, lane 2), which was not detected by the phosphospecific antibody (pS73, lane 4). This result is consistent with the increased abundance but lower phosphorylation status of the N1 bands.
To confirm these results, we next compared a series of inhibitors, including the more recently developed and more specific GSK inhibitor CHIR99021 (Figure 8c). Of the series of drugs tested, we observed a very pronounced increase in abundance in the presence of CHIR99021 (Figure 8c, lanes 1 and 2). Consistent with the more potent and specific inhibition by CHIR99021, the increase in protein levels was considerably more pronounced than in our general observations with lithium chloride. Moreover, in the presence of the

inhibitor within the slower-migrating N1 species, we again observed the appearance of a more rapidly migrating species (arrow, lane 2) indicating increased abundance but lower relative phosphorylation status of the N1 bands. A more modest effect was observed with an independent GSK-3 inhibitor SB16763 (SB, lane 4), but we consistently observed a very pronounced effect with CHIR99021 in numerous independent experiments. Over the course of this work, CHIR resulted in 2.5- to 6-fold increases in CREB-H abundance (see also Supplemental Figure S2, a, c, and d). Furthermore, we found a modest but detectable decrease in the CREB-HTMC protein steadystate levels when cells were incubated with the phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3) kinase inhibitor LY29400 (LY, lane 3). This result is consistent with the known inhibitory effect of PI3 kinase on GSK-3b by phosphorylation of the Ser-9 residue (Cross et al., 1995). No significant effect was observed with rapamycin (lane 6), whereas a modest increase in the steady-state protein levels was seen with tetrabromocinnamic acid (TBCA), an inhibitor of CKII.
Considering the phosphospecific antibody to pS73, one of the candidate sites, we therefore next compared the effect of CHIR and LY (as a control) on the total abundance of the protein (assessed by the epitope tag) and on pS73 (assessed by the phosphospecific antibody), analyzed in identical samples on the same blot simultaneously. The results (Figure 8d) confirmed the pronounced increase in abundance of CREB-HTMC in the presence of CHIR and a modest decrease with LY (SV5, lanes 1-5). In parallel, we found that although there was also an increase in pS73-positive protein abundance in the presence of CHIR, this increase was reproducibly less than that in total protein. This effect was modest, however, with less than twofold difference in the absence and presence of CHIR (Supplemental Figure S2d). A possible explanation for these data is expanded upon in the Discussion, where we propose that although the effects of GSK-3 inhibition were clear, it is also possible that additional kinases and phosphorylation sites were involved in CREB-H modification.
Serine 87/90 substitution mutants display enhanced transcriptional activity We sought to address the formal possibility that stabilization due to S87/90A substitutions in the DSG motif was not due to an unrelated effect--for example, by disrupting the functional activity of the protein after mutating a conserved region. This seemed an unlikely explanation, since mutated proteins are rather more likely to be malfolded and degraded than stabilized and the protein also localized normally to the nucleus. Nevertheless we measured the functional activity of CREBHTMC wt versus DSG mutant in a transcriptional activation assay on the native promoter for one of the main physiological targets of CREB-H identified by us and others, namely apolipoprotein A IV (Lee et al., 2011; Barbosa et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2014). The results (Figure 9a) show that apolipoprotein A IV-Luc transcription was massively increased by the wt protein, with increases in absolute activity of greater than several thousandfold. Consistent with the increases in steady-state levels (Figure 9b), activation by each of the mutants was increased, with the greatest being for the 3S+DSG mutant. However, whereas the mutants were all clearly active, the increases in transcriptional activity of the target were modest and not proportional to the relative increases in protein levels. A reasonable explanation for this is that the nuclear wt product is already highly active on the apolipoprotein A IV promoter-Luc target and that some other limitation in the system or the phenomenon of squelching by overabundant activators (Gill and Ptashne, 1988; Prywes and Zhu, 1992) limits the dynamic range of the assay and the ability to measure further increases in activity.

3S showed elevated levels of the cleaved products, with the greatest being for 3S+DSG, followed by DSG and less but still significant increases for 3S, completely consistent with earlier results. Actin served as a loading control and was analyzed simultaneously on the same blots (Figure 9c). We performed quantitative analysis by reverse transcription-PCR of the levels of endogenous apolipoprotein A IV transcripts (Figure 9d). The results demonstrate a pronounced increase in apolipoprotein A IV transcript levels of 12- and 6-fold for the 3S+DSG and DSG mutants, respectively, compared with wt and a modest but detectable increase for the 3S mutant. Moreover, we also analyzed absolute levels of the native secreted apolipoprotein A IV protein in the medium from similarly transfected cells (Figure 9e). Consistent with the results from analysis of transcript levels, significant increases in apolipoprotein A IV levels were observed, with increases again showing a good correspondence with the relative levels of the cleaved proteins. Thus the elevated steady-state levels of the products from the full-length protein reflected properties we observed in the isolated cleaved protein. Of importance, the serine-rich region examined here is involved in modulating the stability and thus overall activity of CREB-H in a manner relevant to expression of a key physiological target.

Residues S87/90 are illustrated to be a key site for interaction with Fbw1a and thus for degradation by the SCFFbw1a complex in a manner dependent on phosphorylation by CKII but with augmented phosphorylation by GSK-3 at other sites, including the adjacent serine residues around S73-S81. Because GSK inhibition has a much more profound effect on CREB-H stabilization than mutation of the S73-S81 region, we propose that other sites within this region in downstream serines (e.g., 95-100) or indeed elsewhere in the protein may be involved, either as independent sites dictating interaction with SCF or in

GST for the purposes of purification and subsequent analysis of in vitro phosphorylation. CREB-HTMC was amplified from the fulllength vector pSM20 (Bailey et al., 2007) using a 5 primer for insertion in-frame to GST and a 3 primer that introduced a termination codon at the S2P site together with an XbaI site for cloning into the commercial vector pGex-6P-3 (GE Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK). This vector is termed pGST-wt (pDJB126). A mutant version containing S87A and S91A was constructed by insertion of the BamHI-XbaI fragment from the corresponding eukaryotic expression vector constructed (pDJB136) into pDJB126.
The luciferase reporter vector for one of the key CREB-H targets, apolipoprotein A IV, contained the promoter region from -2399 to +85 and was created by amplification from human cell genomic DNA using the primers 5-GCTCGAGATCTATGTCACCTCATAGTCACTAG-3 and 5-TGCCAAGCTTCCTGAGCTGCTT­ GCTGG­GCT-3 and insertion into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega) at the BglII and HindIII restriction sites. This vector was termed pGL3-hApoA-IV-LUC.
The pcDNA3.1 Flag expression vector for the F-box factor Fbw1a/TrCP (Busino et al., 2003) was obtained from Michele Pagano (Department of Pathology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY). The dominant-negative Flag-tagged Cul1, pcDNAHCUL1-N452-FLAG (Jin et al., 2005), was obtained from Wade Harper (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA).
Transfections Transfections were performed using Genejammer (Agilent Technologies, Cheshire, UK) or FuGENE (Promega, Southampton, UK) transfection reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions or the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure modified by the use of {N,N-bis(2-hydroxyetyhl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid}-buffered saline (pH 7.06) as previously described (Batchelor and O'Hare, 1992). Routinely, 0.5-1 g of the appropriate expression vector was transfected with amounts of DNA normalized using pUC19 carrier DNA.
Expression of recombinant proteins GST-wt and GST-DSG were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 after induction of cells with isopropyl--d-thiogalactoside (1 mM) for 4 h at 30°C. Bacteria were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], 1% Triton, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors [1× Complete Protease; Roche, SigmaAldrich, Gillingham, UK]), and sonicated. The lysates were incubated for 1 h with glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Life Sciences), and the beads then washed extensively with lysis buffer and stored at 4°C for assay. In each case, samples were equalized by either optical density reading of purified protein or SDS-PAGE analysis and quantitation of the stained bands. Equal amounts of substrates were then used for the in vitro kinase assays as described next.
In vitro kinase assays Bacterially expressed proteins that were bound to glutathione Sepharose 4B were washed with the appropriate reaction buffer for either CKII or GSK-3. The CKII reaction buffer contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 200 M ATP, and 500 Ci/mol -32P-ATP, pH 7.5. The GSK-3 reaction buffer contained 25 mM Tris-HCl, 12 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM glycerophosphate, 100 M sodium orthovanadate, 200 M ATP, and 500 Ci/mol -32P-ATP, pH 7.5. Samples were incubated with 100 U of purified CKII (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK) in 40 l of reaction buffer or in certain cases with 100 l of cellular lysate (and 200 M ATP, 500 Ci/mol -32P-ATP) for 45 min at 30°C. For

sequential phosphorylation, samples were first incubated with one kinase in the appropriate reaction buffer. The GST-fusion protein substrates were then purified on the glutathione-agarose beads, washed extensively, and then incubated with the second kinase in the appropriate buffer. Reactions were stopped by washing in reaction buffer and boiling in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, the gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) for total protein assessment, and dried gels were exposed to autoradiography.
Generation of phosphospecific antibodies Nonoverlapping peptides were selected for the generation of antibodies to phosphorylated forms of S73, S81, and S87. The peptides were coupled at their N-terminal end to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with the incorporation of a cysteine residue for coupling purposes and with phosphoserine in place of serine as follows: for pS81, (C)LGSGD[pS]LPS; for pS81, (C)PLW[pS]PEGSD; and for pS87, (C) PEGSD[pS]GI. Rabbits were immunized by standard protocols (Thermo Scientific) and specific antibody to phosphorylated species isolated by positive-negative selection. Phosphospecific antibody was first positively selected by binding to columns with immobilized phosphorylated form of the immunizing peptide. After washing to remove nonspecific and unreactive material, peptide-specific antibodies were then eluted. From this eluate, phosphospecific antibodies were then enriched by negative selection on columns with immobilized form of the native unmodified peptide, where in this case the flow through unbound material contains the phosphospecific antibody. Confirmation of reactivity to the intact protein and the phosphospecific nature of the detection were then confirmed both by site-directed mutagenesis of the specific serine residue and the sensitivity of reactivity to phosphatase treatment as described in Results.
Phosphatase treatment Cells transfected with expression vectors for wt and mutant CREBHTMC were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped, and pelleted. After suspension in PBS, samples were lysed in buffer for  phosphatase containing 0.4% NP-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (1× Complete Protease; Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. As controls, two aliquots of the sample were treated with orthovanadate (10 mM) and sodium fluoride (20 mM) and incubated at 37°C either with or without added phosphatase for 30 min to reflect the starting material before incubation with phosphatase alone. Parallel samples were then incubated with 400 U of  phosphatase and incubated at 37°C for different times up to 30 min. The reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer to 1× and boiling for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.
Western blot analysis Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 10 or 12% SDS- PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 5% nonfat dried milk or 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After blocking, membranes were incubated in PBST/5% dried milk or 5% BSA overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies anti-V5, 1:10,000 (Life Technologies); anti-actin 20-36, 1:2500; anti-actin AC-40, 1:2500; anti-CREB-H pS73 and pS81, 1:100 (this work); anti-apolipoprotein A IV 1D6B6 (1:2000, Cell Signaling, Leiden, The Netherlands); or anti-Flag, 1:1000. Antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated, Membranes were washed three times in PBS/0.05% Tween and incubated for a further 1 h in PBST/5%

dried milk or 5% BSA containing the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (for detection by conventional chemiluminescence detection) or antibodies conjugated with Dylight680 or Dylight800 (Fisher Scientific, Lutterworth, UK) for detection by laser scanning using the LI-COR Odyssey Image system. This latter method was routinely used for CREB-H detection using the phosphospecific antibodies since it allowed simultaneous analysis on one blot of total CREB-H species with the mouse antibody to the epitope tag in one channel and the phosphorylated forms with antibody to the rabbit antibody to the phosphorylated peptide in a second channel. For quantitative estimates of protein half-lives (Figure 3), blots were scanned in the appropriate channel, background subtracted, and normalized for loading using actin abundance in the separate channel. Data were analyzed in the GraphPad software package using nonlinear regression analyses for one-phase decay.
Inhibitor treatments Brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared as 10 mg/ml stocks in methanol and added to cells at a final concentration from 1 g/ml for 30 min. Cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared as 100 mg/ ml stock in ethanol and used at a final concentration of 100 g/ml for times indicated in the text. MG132 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and used at a final concentration of 10 M as stated in the text and added together with cycloheximide. SB216763 (Tocris Biosciences, Bristol, UK) was prepared at 20 mM in DMSO and added at 20 M. CHIR99021 (Tocris Biosciences), LY29400 (Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK), and TBCA (Calbiochem) were prepared at 10 mM in DMSO and added at 10 or 5 M as indicated. Rapamycin (Calbiochem) was prepared in 10 mM DMSO and added at 1 M in appropriate media.
Transcription activation assays COS-1 cells were seeded into 24-well plates and transfected in triplicate with expression vectors for CREBH.TMC or mutants together with the target luciferase reporter vector. The luciferase reporter vector (pGL3-hApoA-IV-LUC) for the principal CREB-H target, ApoA IV, was created as described. A series of preliminary dose-response experiments was carried out to optimize parameters of target and expression vector concentration and time. In each case, total DNA was equalized with appropriate amount of pUC19 plasmid DNA. Cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection by addition of Glo Lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was assayed using the Bright-Glo assay system as described by the manufacturer and activity measured using a Victor luminescence reader. Assays were routinely performed in triplicate and readings calculated as fold increase relative to control alone.
Analysis of apolipoprotein A IV transcription For quantitative PCR, total RNA was prepared using RNeasy isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions including DNase treatment (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Quality control (absorbance ratio 280 /260 nm) was 2.0 for all samples analyzed. cDNA was synthesized from 2 g of total RNA using anchored oligo(dT)12-18 primers and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies). For quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qPCR), primers were designed using qPrimerDepot software (primerdepot.nci.nih.gov/), and specificity against genomic DNA was validated by conventional PCR with Thermo 2x Reddymix PCR master mix (Thermo Scientific, Lutterworth, UK). qPCR was performed with SYBR select mastermix for CFX (Life Technologies)

using the Bio-Rad CFX96 Detection System instrument and software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom). In all, 0.5 l of cDNA was used per 20 l of reaction with the following cycling conditions: an initial activation at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. A melt curve analysis was included as the final step, which consisted of temperature increments of 0.5°C from 55 to 95°C. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate and normalized to TATA box-binding protein housekeeping gene. Primer sequences were as follows, with forward primer indicated first and reverse primer indicated second:
ApoA IV: CCGTGGAACATCTCCAGAAA, AAAGGGCACCAG­ CTTCTTCT
CREBH: TGCAATCTCACCGTGAAAGA, GAGCACCAGCTCCTGACAGT
TBP: TATAATCCCAAGCGGTTTGC, GCTGGAAAACCCAACT­ TCTG
Analysis of apolipoprotein A IV secretion Apolipoprotein A IV levels were analyzed as described previously (Barbosa et al., 2013). Medium was harvested from the test cells and proteins precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min and pellets washed twice with 100% ice-cold acetone or ethanol. Pellets were air-dried and subsequently resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer. Apolipoprotein A IV levels were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described.
Immunofluorescence analysis Cells (1 × 105 cells/35-mm well) were plated on glass coverslips placed in plastic tissue culture vessels and processed 40 h after transfection. For routine immunofluorescence analysis, cells were washed in PBS, fixed with ice-cold methanol, and blocked in PBS/10% NBCS for 45 min. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS/10% NBCS and applied for 45 min. Primary antibodies used were anti-SV5 (1:1000; Life Technologies); fluorochrome (Alexa 488)-conjugated secondary antibodies of appropriate specificity (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) were diluted 1:200 in PBS/10% NBCS and added for 45 min. After washing, cells were mounted in Mowiol and visualized using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope imaging system and a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat (63×, 1.4 numerical aperture) lens. Images for each channel were captured sequentially with eightfold averaging at an image size of 512 × 512 pixels. Composite illustrations were prepared using Adobe software. Example images shown are representative of numerous images gathered for each test construct and condition.

Abstract Objectives To investigate in preterm infants associations between Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) parameters of the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) and corpus callosum (CC) and age, white matter (WM) injury and clinical factors. Methods In 84 preterm infants DTI was performed between 40-62 weeks postmenstrual age on 3 T MR. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and fibre lengths through the PLIC and the genu and splenium were determined. WM injury was categorised as normal/mildly, moderately and severely abnormal. Associations between DTI parameters and age, WM injury and clinical factors were analysed. Results A positive association existed between FA and age at imaging for fibres through the PLIC (r=0.48 p<0.001) and splenium (r=0.24 p<0.01). A negative association existed between ADC and age at imaging for fibres through the PLIC (r=-0.65 p<0.001), splenium (r=-0.35 p<0.001) and genu (r=-0.53 p<0.001). No association was found between DTI parameters and gestational age, degree of WM injury or categorical clinical factors. Conclusions These results indicate that in our cohort of very preterm infants, at this young age, the development of the PLIC and CC is ongoing and independent of the degree of prematurity or WM injury.

Introduction
Infants born at a gestational age (GA) below 32 weeks are prone to diffuse white matter (WM) injury [1, 2]. This may eventually result in damage, underdevelopment and atrophy of the internal capsule and the corpus callosum (CC) [3-7]. Conventional MRI techniques detect WM injury and depict features of brain maturation [2, 8-15]. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has been proposed as an additional tool in the assessment of WM injury and may provide more

adequate diagnostic and prognostic information in relation to neurological outcome than conventional MR imaging [16-21]. DTI enables quantitative assessment of maturation, tract organisation and injury by calculating Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) values. Fibre tractography offers insight into developing WM by visualisation of the WM tracts [17- 19, 22-25]. The non-invasive nature of DTI permits longitudinal and diagnostic clinical studies [26-33].
Until now, the clinical use of DTI fibre tractography in very preterm infants (VPTI) has been restricted by the lack of normal reference values for FA and ADC [16]. Only a few studies have used DTI in VPTI with a GA below 32 weeks [16, 18, 23-25]. In most of these studies MRI was performed before term equivalent age (TEA). Little is known about the changes in FA or ADC in the developing brain around TEA [18, 34-37]. Data on the influence of diffuse WM injury on tract maturation and organisation around TEA are scarce [35, 38, 39].
We studied DTI parameters (FA and ADC values and lengths of fibres) of WM tracts passing through the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) and the CC in VPTI undergoing MRI at or within the first months of TEA. The aims of this exploratory study were to establish the association between DTI parameters and:
& GA and postmenstrual age (PMA) at the time of imaging
& The degree of WM injury & Categorical clinical factors that may influence brain
maturation
Materials and methods
Preterm infants
As part of an ongoing prospective study of VPTI with a GA32 weeks, admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of our institution, 113 infants underwent MRI (3 Tesla) between May 2006 and October 2007.
MRI was preferably performed at TEA (PMA 40- 44 weeks). For infants who were unstable and/or ventilator dependent around that age, MRI was postponed (PMA range 40-62 weeks). Ethical approval for the study was given by the institutional review board and informed parental consent was obtained for each infant. In 102 infants DTI was performed. Three children with congenital brain abnormalities were excluded. In 15 cases, fibre tractography was not possible due to motion artefacts. In the remaining 84 infants a complete DTI dataset was acquired. Clinical parameters were retrospectively collected from the patient's medical records (Table 1).

Image and data acquisition
All MRI examinations were performed on a 3 Tesla MR system (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) according to a standard protocol [40]. The infants were sedated using chloral hydrate (55 mg/kg), laid supine and snugly swaddled during the imaging procedure. Ear protection consisted of neonatal earmuffs (Natus Mini Muffs; Natus Medical Inc., San Carlos, CA, USA) covered by a headphone. All MRI examinations included a 3D T1TFE sequence (TR 9.7 ms, TE 4.6 ms, flip angle 8, TFE factor 128, slice thickness 1 mm) and a T2-TSE sequence (TR 6269 ms, TE 120 ms, turbo factor 18, slice thickness 2 mm). In addition a DTI sequence (SE-EPI, TR 7,456 ms, TE 54 ms, slice thickness 2 mm, voxel size 1,4×1,4×2 mm with diffusion acquisitions in 32 directions and a b-value of 1,000 s/mm2, EPI factor 56) with an imaging time of 5 min and 34 s was acquired.
Fibre tractography of the PLIC and CC
DTI datasets were analysed on an off-line workstation using commercially available processing software as provided by the manufacturer (FiberTrak, by Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands). DTI colour-coded maps were automatically computed, red representing a right-left, green an anterior-posterior and blue a superior-inferior orientation. These colour-coded DTI maps were used to place a single seed to perform fibre tracking using an automated 3D seeded algorithm. First, for the PLIC in the axial plane at the level of the lateral ventricles and subsequently for the genu and splenium of the CC in the mid-sagittal plane regions of interest were defined. The seed was placed as is shown in Fig. 1. Position changes of the seed-point in the structure of interest resulted in identical fibre tracts, indicating the robustness of the method used. Two investigators (FTdB and AvS, blinded to subject's age and degree of WM injury) identified the regions of interest and manually placed the individual seeds in consensus for each region of interest. Subsequently, fibre tracts were generated through the PLIC and the callosal genu and splenium resulting in visualisation of fibres (Fig. 2). The quality of all tracts was visually assessed in order to minimise erroneous pathways, which were erased and not used in further analyses. In all analyses, default settings were used consisting of a minimum FA of 0.15, a maximum angle change of 27.0 degrees and a minimum fibre length of 10.0 mm. We used the manufacturer default settings, since (small) changes of these settings, to optimize the performance of the fibre tracking, did not have any influence on the fibres picked by the tracking routine. Finally FA and ADC values of these fibre bundles were obtained and the length of the fibres was calculated.

WM injury
All T1-W and T2-W sequences were analysed by two investigators (FTdB, paediatric neuroradiologist with more than 15 years of experience, LML, with more than 4 years' experience) by consensus to assess WM injury. We categorised the WM injury into [41]:
& Normal/mildly abnormal WM: normal appearing WM or homogeneous diffuse and excessive high signal intensity (DEHSI) as seen on T2-weighted images, or few (6) punctate white matter lesions (PWML)
& Moderately abnormal WM: multiple (> 6) PWML and/ or small localised cystic lesions and/or heterogeneous DEHSI
& Severely abnormal WM: extensive or diffuse heterogeneous signal intensity changes and/or haemorrhagic or cystic lesions involving the periventricular and/or subcortical WM
Accordingly, 18 infants were classified as having normal/mildly, 51 infants moderately and 15 infants severely abnormal WM (Table 1)

Eur Radiol (2011) 21:538-547
Statistical analysis
Data were analysed using SPSS 16.0.2 for Windows. Frequency counts and percentages were used to summarise categorical variables. For continuous variables, the mean, standard deviation of the mean and range are reported (Table 1).
Differences between DTI values of left and right PLIC and between the genu and splenium of the CC were determined by using Wilcoxon signed rank tests for related samples.
To establish the association between DTI parameters and age, weight and head circumference (HC) Spearman Rank correlation coefficients were calculated.
Stepwise linear regression analysis was used to assess the relative importance of the various study population characteristics that were associated with the DTI parameters through the PLIC and CC. Applying this model we corrected all other parameters for PMA at MRI and HC. Variables, for which the p value by univariate analyses tests was0.1, were included in the subsequent linear stepwise regression analysis.
To determine the association between DTI parameters and WM injury and categorical clinical factors, Mann-Whitney U analyses or Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed where appropriate. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc Scheffe tests were used to compare DTI parameters between groups categorised as normal/mildly, moderately or severely abnormal WM.
A p value0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.
Results
General characteristics of the study population
Clinical characteristics for all 84 infants are shown in Table 1.
Quantitative DTI values
The FA and ADC values and length of fibres (mean, SD and range) through the PLIC and genu and splenium of the CC are shown in Table 2. As we found no statistical differences or any laterality between left and right DTI values in the PLIC, these DTI values were averaged. In the genu lower FA (p<0.001), lower ADC values (p<0.001) and shorter fibres (p<0.001) were found compared with the splenium of the CC.
Association between DTI parameters and continuous clinical variables

variables. DTI parameters in the PLIC (p<0.001) and CC (p<0.001 and p<0.01) correlated strongly with PMA at MRI, except for the FA in the genu of the CC. The FA (p< 0.01), ADC (p<0.001) and fibre length (p<0.01) through the PLIC and fibre length through the genu and splenium of the CC (p<0.001, p<0.01 and p<0.001, p<0.001 respectively) correlated with weight and HC at MRI. No or only weak associations were found between FA, ADC and fibre length through the PLIC or CC and GA or birth weight.
Because of the wide age range, we re-analysed data for a subgroup of infants (69/84) who underwent imaging between 40-46 weeks PMA. For this subgroup, we still found a significant association between FA (r=0.252 p<0.05), ADC (r=-0.470 p<0.01) and fibre length in the PLIC (r=0.410 p<0.01) and PMA at MRI. The association between FA, ADC values or fibre length in the PLIC and weight and HC at MRI no longer existed. For the genu, no association between FA and any continuous clinical variable was found, while the association between ADC (r=-0.268 p<0.05) or fibre length (r=0.402 p<0.01) and PMA at MRI remained. For the splenium we found an association between fibre length and weight and HC at MRI (respectively r=0.337 p<0.01and r=0.332 p<0.05). The association with PMA at MRI was no longer present, still the association between fibre length and HC at birth remained (r=0.417 p<0.05).
Figure 3 shows the individual data depicting the association between the FA and ADC of fibres through the PLIC and GA as well as PMA at MRI. This figure illustrates the association between FA and ADC values with PMA at imaging, whereas no such association exists with GA.
Results of the stepwise regression analyses are shown in Table 4, delineating the strongest contributing factor of clinical parameters. In all but three cases, PMA at MRI was

the strongest contributing factor to most of the DTI parameters (FA and ADC of the fibres through the PLIC, ADC and fibre length of the fibres through the genu and splenium, and FA of the splenium). For two of the remaining three parameters (FA in the fibres through the genu and fibre length in the fibres through the splenium) HC at birth contributed most. For the length of fibres through the PLIC, the HC at MRI contributed most.
Association between DTI parameters and WM injury and categorical clinical factors
We found no association between DTI parameters for the PLIC or CC and degree of WM injury. When comparing the groups with different degrees of WM injury, we also found no significant differences in DTI parameters (Table 5). These results remained, even after correction for PMA at MRI.
No associations existed between DTI parameters and categorical clinical factors.
Discussion
In this study, we determined FA and ADC values and the length of WM fibres passing through the PLIC and CC in a cohort of 84 VPTI imaged between 40 and 62 weeks PMA. We assessed the association between DTI parameters and age, diffuse WM injury and clinical factors.
All DTI parameters of the PLIC and most DTI parameters of the CC were strongly associated with PMA at imaging. We found no associations between DTI parameters and GA, the degree of WM injury or any categorical clinical factor.

In a previous study by Dudink et al. of very low birth weight infants undergoing imaging within 4 days of birth an association was found between FA of the PLIC and GA. They found no association between ADC values and GA [16]. Although we did not find an association between FA or ADC of the PLIC and GA, we found a positive association between FA and PMA at MRI and a negative association between ADC and PMA at MRI. Increase in FA and decrease in ADC have been described before and reflect the (pre-)myelination and parallel organisation of fibres, such as expected in the development of the PLIC [17, 23, 24]. As we found no association with GA, the

maturation of the PLIC seems to progress with age, independent of the degree of prematurity. Similar to our findings in the PLIC, no associations were found between DTI parameters of fibres passing through the CC and GA, while DTI parameters of the CC showed a significant association with PMA at MRI, except for the FA values of the genu. This indicates ongoing maturation of the splenium of the CC around TEA, again independent of GA, while for the genu this seems less clear. These findings are in agreement with the results of Partridge et al. who found no significant maturational trends of the genu of the CC in their serial study of 14 premature neonates with a GA between 25 and 34 weeks, of whom eight underwent a second MRI around TEA [24].
We found no associations between DTI values for the PLIC or CC and the degree of WM injury. These findings are only partly in agreement with the results of Hüppi et al., who at TEA found no difference in ADC values of WM between preterm infants with and without WM lesions. They found a 20% lower regional anisotropy in fibres descending from the internal capsule in children with WM injury compared with those without [18]. Our data do not confirm this latter finding. This may be explained by the fact that we studied a prospective cohort of unselected VPTI, with relatively small numbers of children with normal or severely abnormal WM. Hüppi et al. selected ten infants with WM injury and matched these with ten infants of the same GA and neonatal course but with normal MRI. Our results also differ from those of Counsell et al., who demonstrated in preterm infants who underwent imaging around TEA (38.86-43.86 weeks), that radial diffusivity in the PLIC and the splenium of the CC and axial and radial diffusivity in the WM were significantly elevated in infants with DEHSI compared with those with normal appearing WM and term control

Fig. 3 Scatter plots of the individual data of the association between the FA and ADC of fibres through the PLIC and GA and PMA at MRI, showing no association with GA, a positive association between FA and PMA and a negative association between ADC and PMA

infants [37]. Counsell et al. randomly recruited 38 preterm infants and compared these with 8 healthy term born controls. The preterm infants were divided into a group with normal appearing WM and a group with DEHSI. Infants with overt WM injury were excluded from their study. The difference with our results may again be explained by the fact that we studied a group of unselected VPTI. It may also be hypothesised that the wide age range at imaging in our study group plays a role. However, as the results in the subgroup of infants undergoing imaging before 46 weeks were comparable to those in the whole group, we feel this will not have influenced our results. Possibly the unequal distribution of infants with normal/ mildly, moderately or severely abnormal WM has played a more important role. However, when comparing the 18

subjects with normal/mildly abnormal WM with the 15 with severe WM injury we found no difference between these two groups. In a recent study Cheong et al. [39] found a difference in FA in the PLIC in VPTI with extensive WM injury compared with VPTI with normal or focal WM injury using DTI region of interest measurements. In their study 39 infants had no WM signal intensity abnormalities, 59 infants had focal and 13 infants extensive WM abnormalities. The categorisation of WM injury we used is very similar to that of Cheong et al., but they included a large number of infants with normal appearing WM whereas that group was relatively small in our study.
Furthermore, in accordance with the study of Counsell et al [37] we did not identify any categorical clinical factors associated with DTI parameters.

For the CC we found significantly different DTI values between the genu and splenium. In the genu FA and ADC values were significantly lower, indicating that at this young age the genu is less developed than the splenium. In terms of development similar findings have been reported by Barkovich, who pointed out that the myelination of the splenium precedes that of the genu on conventional MRI [9].
One of the main limitations of our study is that, due to clinical circumstances not all VPTI were imaged around

545
TEA. Therefore, although most were imaged before 46 weeks PMA (69/84), a wide age range existed. On the other hand, this enabled us to study the relation between PMA and DTI values. Another limitation of the present study is that we did not perform DTI in normal term infants. Therefore we were unable to compare the DTI values of the VPTI with those of a healthy control group.
We performed fibre tractography with commercially available software and with given default settings. Still, one of the limitations of fibre tracking is that in other studies different parameters or different tracking programs may be used, complicating the direct comparison of fibre tracking values between studies. Finally, as we performed fibre tractography of fibres passing through PLIC and CC, we only calculated DTI values in the WM tracts passing through these structures. We may therefore have missed a possible association between DTI parameters and either normal or injured WM.
In conclusion, our data show in VPTI imaged around or within 5 months of TEA, a strong association between DTI parameters of the PLIC and CC and PMA at imaging, but not between these values and GA. No association was found between DTI parameters of the PLIC and CC and the degree of WM injury or categorical clinical factors.
Although it has been reported that WM injury may result in atrophy of the PLIC and CC later on in life [3-7], our results indicate that in our cohort of VPTI, at this young age, the development of the PLIC and CC is ongoing and independent of the degree of prematurity or diffuse WM injury.

In the preceding paper (1) the production and the clinical features of experimental Type III pneumococcus pneumonia in monkeys of the M. cynomolgos species were described. The experimental disease in its clinical aspects closely resembles lobar pneumonia in man. The infection in these animals results in a pneumonic lesion of lobar distribution which tends to spread and which terminates after a variable period in spontaneous recovery or death. The irregularity of the course of the disease in individual animals is striking, but when septicemia is present the mortality rate increases proportionately with the number of organisms in the circulating blood. Thus, the height of the septicemia, irrespective of the size of the infecting dose, was found to be the most valuable objective index of the severity of the disease in a given animal.
In earlier studies, Avery and Dubos (2) showed that a specific enzyme of bacterial origin was capable of protecting mice against subsequent infection with Type III Pneumococcus, and of exerting a curative effect on infections already established. The beneficial effect of the enzyme was demonstrated to be due to its capacity to decompose the specific capsular polysaccharide of Type III Pneumococcus, thus rendering the bacteria readily susceptible to phagocytosis by the cells of the animal body.
Studying the effect of the enzyme upon a dermal infection with Type I I I Pneumococcus in rabbits, Goodner, Dubos, and Avery (3)

found t h a t 95 per cent of untreated rabbits died, while of those which were treated with enzyme, 95 per cent recovered. With the amounts of enzyme employed, there was found to be a degree of infection which, although influenced by enzyme, terminated fatally. Goodner and Dubos (4) later showed that the amount of enzyme required for successful therapy increased with the height of the septicemia.
Since it had been found possible regularly to produce an experimental pneumonia in monkeys very similar to lobar pneumonia in man, it was of interest to determine the effect of treatment with specific enzyme upon the course and outcome of the disease. It was fully recognized that the methods employed in the production of enzyme were not standardized, and that different lots of enzyme varied considerably in their potency. Certain lots even contained substances which were toxic for animals. In spite of these technical imperfections, the treatment of experimental lobar pneumonia in monkeys was begun. The present paper reports the results of enzyme treatment of experimental Type I I I pneumococcus pneumonia in 40 monkeys. All animals were treated within the first 3 days after infection. Consequently, they have been divided into groups on the basis of the height of the septicemia during the first 3 days of the disease. This classification affords a basis for comparison of the results with the 68 untreated monkeys included in the preceding paper.

EXPERIMENTAL
Selection of Animals for Treatment.--Because of the extreme variations in the severity of the experimental disease in different monkeys, it was not feasible to select alternate animals for treatment and controls. Only after the disease was established was it possible to determine which animals in a given experiment were the most likely to succumb. Consequently, the sickest animals in each experimental group (2 to 6 in number) were chosen for enzyme therapy. The criteria on which the choice was based were the fever, the number of circulating leukocytes,the X-ray evidence,the generalconditionof the animal, and especially the height of the septicemia.
Enzyme.--The preparations of the enzyme were made by methods previously described (5); but from time to time minor changes were introduced in attempts to produce a more potent product. The enzymecontent of the differentpreparations varied from 2 to 20 units per cc.
Procedure of Treatment.--Practically all therapeutic experiments were carried out during the winter and spring, when experimentalconditions were more nearly

FRANCIS, TERRELL, DUBOS~ AND AVERY

643

stable and the smaller doses of organisms were more efficient in producing typical pneumonia. During the period of treatment the animal's temperature was recorded, repeated blood cultures and blood counts were made, and the X-rays were carefully studied for evidence of extension or regression of the pneumonic process. A blood culture and white blood cell count were made immediately before treatment. Because of variation in the enzyme content of different lots, the usual procedure was to administer 10 cc. of the enzyme preparation intravenously. Further treatment was based upon the response to the first injection, the severity of the disease, and the potency of the particular preparation of enzyme. Additional treatments were given as often as three times daily, either intravenously, intraperitoneally, or by both routes simultaneously. When enzyme therapy was employed, treatment was always begun within the first 3 days after infection.

No attempt was made to ascertain the minimal amount of enzyme required in individual monkeys, but, rather, treatment was intensively employed until the result was assured.
RESULTS
In the entire series of 40 monkeys with pneumonia, in which enzyme therapy was employed, the mortality rate was 20 per cent. The animals have been subdivided into four groups based on the height of the septicemia during the first 3 days of the disease (Table I). The distribution of the cases is comparable to that of the untreated series (1). With one exception, the fatal cases fall into the group with extreme septicemia and marked prostration. The height of the septi-

cemia during the first 3 days, and the number of pulmonary lobes involved, in relation to recovery or death, are represented graphically in Chart 1. The amount of pulmonary involvement was, in general, greater in the fatal cases than in those which recovered. The salient features of the disease in the different groups are discussed in detail.

Group A. Lobar Pneumonia without Septicemia
In this group of 8 animals, no demonstrable invasion of the blood had occurred at the time treatment was begun, which in 6 instances

FRANCIS, TERKELL, DUBOS, AND AVERY

645

was on the 1st day, in 2 on the 2nd day after infection. All 8 animals recovered. The average weight of the group was 2130 gm. The average amount of culture employed for inoculation was 0.35 cc. In 2 cases there was involvement of three pulmonary lobes, in 1 case two lobes, while in the remaining 5 only one lobe was involved. The average duration of the disease was 3.2 days after infection. This was estimated, to a great extent, upon the time when regression of the pneumonia was noted in the X-ray. The temperature curve and the white blood count were of less value, since some febrile reaction and fall in the number of circulating leukocytes frequently followed administration of enzyme. When a rise in the number of leukocytes began, however, recovery was usually definitely established.
No attempt was made to ascertain the minimal amount of enzyme required. The number of units of enzyme given to animals in this group varied from 100 units to 360, and the number of treatments varied from a single dose to four over a period of 3 days. In most instances, improvement began shortly after treatment was instituted. The monkey became more alert; there was a tendency for the fever to subside; regression of the shadow, most noticeable at the margins, was observed in the X-ray film.
In comparison with the untreated animals (1) without septicemia, the course of the disease in the treated animals was, on the average, of shorter duration. Furthermore, from a clinical standpoint, the animals of this group were, at the time treatment was begun, sicker than those of the untreated group, and the amount of pulmonary involvement was greater. In some instances, it is possible that with a spreading pneumonia, septicemia and death might have occurred in the absence of treatment. In no instance was a prolonged illness noted, although one monkey, No. 4-2, while recovering from pneumonia, developed cutaneous sores and on the 6th day a septicemia due to Staphylococcus aureus and a Gram-negative bacillus. When sacrificed, the lungs showed definite resolution and the cultures from the pneumonic lobes revealed no pneumococci.
Monkey 1-11 (Chart 2) was treated on the 2rid day after infection, when the right upper lobe was completely involved. At that time the temperature was high, but followinga single treatment with 50 units of enzyme there was a critical fall of the fever; no spread of the lesion occurred. On the 3rd day another treat-

of this course of events occurred in Monkey 1-1 of the untreated group, in which septicemia recurred and a fatal termination resulted. In all but 2 cases the pneumonic process was clearly extending at the time of treatment.
Treatment of this group of animals resulted in 100 per cent recovery, in contrast to 55 per cent recovery in the untreated group with comparable septicemia. The average time of recovery was 3.6 days after infection. In 13 of the 15 cases, sterilization of the blood was effected

~RANCIS, TE~RELL, DUBOS, AND AVERY

655

by the first treatment, in some instances within 4 hours. In one exception, the enzyme was found later to be contaminated, and Type III Pneumococcus was recovered in culture from the blood together with a Gram-negative bacillus. In spite of this, resolution began promptly and continued. In the other case, the blood culture at the time of the first treatment was negative, but a second culture taken 2½ hours later was positive. A third culture on the following d a y was negative. In another animal, following therapy and while recovery was under way, an intercurrent superficial infection of the extremities was noted, and a Gram-negative bacillus was isolated from the blood.
In 10, or possibly 11 cases, no spread of the pneumonic lesion was demonstrable by X-ray the day following the first treatment; in the majority, resolution was clearly seen. In the 4 cases in which extension of the lesion was noted the 1st day after treatment, there was no further progression as treatment was continued. Concomitantly with the improvement as shown by sterilization of the blood and decrease in the size of the pneumonic process, there was usually a fall in temperature, except in cases in which febrile reactions followed later injections of enzyme. The animals also became stronger and more alert.
In comparison with similar untreated cases (1), the duration of disease in the treated animals was, on the average, almost 1day shorter than in the untreated animals which recovered, and 2 days shorter than in the fatal cases. Of the untreated cases which recovered, only 2 of 11 presented septicemia on the 1st day of disease, whereas of the 9 fatal cases, 7 had positive blood cultures on the 1st day. The treated cases appear to be more comparable to the latter animals, since of the 15 treated animals 13 had positive blood cultures the 1st day after infection, and, in general, higher septicemias than the fatal cases of the parallel untreated group. The pulmonary involvement was comparable in that progressively spreading pneumonia of lobar distribution was present at the time of treatment. The prompt subsidence of the septicemia and limitation of spread after treatment, together with general improvement, contrasts sharply with the course of the disease in the untreated series.
Monkey 1-18 (Chart 4) represents the type of case in which two pulmonary lobes were involved early in the disease and a relatively high septicemia (60

colonies per cc.) was present. Treatment begun on the 2nd day resulted in prompt control of the pneumonia, and recovery of the animal.
Monkey 9-2 (Chart 5) illustrates the type of case in which treatment was begun on the 2nd day. The blood, which contained 16 colonies per cc. at the time of treatment, was promptly sterilized, but the X-ray the following day showed some extension of the pneumonia. There is the possibility that the spread

of the lesion seen in the X-ray on the 3rd day occurred in the interval of 6 hours between the time of the X-ray and the time treatment was begun. Nevertheless, recovery rapidly followed.
Group C. Lobar Pneumonia with Septicemia (250-2000 Colonies per Cc.)
This group comprises 9 animals in which the experimentally induced pneumonia was accompanied by a high septicemia, ranging from the mildest case with 344 colonies per cc. of blood in the first 3 days after infection, to 2 cases with 1700 and 1728 colonies, respectively, during

that period. Needless to say, the degree of illness in this group was severe. However, 8 of the treated animals recovered, giving a recovery rate of 88.9 per cent. This contrasts with the results in untreated animals with similar severity of disease of which only 25 per cent recovered.
The average weight of the animals was 1880 gin.; the average amount of culture injected was 0.39 cc. In the 1 animal which died, there was involvement of two

A treatment of 120 units of enzyme was given 4] hours later, 6 hours after the treatment, the septicemia was reduced to 160 colonies per cc. At this time, the monkey had an attack of choking and died. A search at autopsy revealed no tracheal obstruction, but definite pneumonic consolidation was present in the right upper and lower lobes, and Type I I I Pneumococcus was recovered from the pericardial fluid. The spleen was small and bound by dense adhesions.

In 2 d the 8 recovered cases, two lobes were involved; in the remaining 6, only one lobe was affected. In 6, the leukocyte count dropped below 5000 at the height of the disease, and in one case to 1000, but at the beginning of recovery a definite rise occurred. 5 were treated on the 2nd day after infection, 2 on the 1st day, and one on the 3rd day. Repeated treatments were given, the total amounts of enzyme varying from 177.$ units to 942 units. Although in 3 instances the degree of septicemia increased after treatment was instituted, in only 2 was there definite extension of the pneumonia after treatment. In fact, in 4 cases the

roentgenograms revealed the beginning of resolution before the blood was cleared of organisms. Furthermore, a fall in temperature and an improvement in the general condition of the animals occurred at about the same time regression of the lesion was noted by X-ray, even though the septicemia might continue for several days (Monkey 8-0). In general, in spite of the high septicemia, the action of the enzyme in effecting the sterilization of the blood was usually prompt and striking; the average time of recovery, based on final sterilization of the blood and X-ray evidence, was 5.4 days after infection.

In 6 of the untreated cases, empyema, pericarditis, or both, were found at autopsy; under treatment, these complications were either prevented, or, if present, (and the incidence in the untreated would suggest the probability) they also responded favorably to treatment. In the treated group, the degree of the septicemia at the time of treatment was consistently more severe than it was in the untreated animals at comparable times.

Monkey 7-2 (Chart 6) showed pneumonic consolidation of the mid-portion of the right upper lobe on the 1st day after infection. A blood culture yielded 1400 colonies of Type I I I Pneumococcus per cc. of blood, and the leukocytes had dropped to 4200 per c.mm. The first treatment, given 24 hours after infection, resulted in a prompt drop in the septicemia. Four treatments in the next 48 hours brought about prompt recovery. Even on the 2nd day, when the lesion was spreading in part of the lobe, the original site of consolidation was clearing.
Monkey 1-29 (Chart 7) is an instance in which treatment was begun on the 2nd day after infection when most of the right upper lobe was consolidated and the septicemia had reached a height of 1480 colonies per cc. Four treatments during the next 2 days resulted in obvious resolution of the pneumonia, sterilization of the blood, and recovery.

Group D. Lobar Pneumonia with Septicemia (More than 2000 Colonies per Co.)
This group of 8 monkeys represents the extreme form of infection in which the tendency was toward a diffuse pulmonary involvement, overwhelming septicemia, extreme fall in white blood count, failure in febrile response, and early death. Nevertheless, of the 8 treated cases, 1 recovered, a mortality rate of 87.5 per cent.

The average weight of the animals was 1820gin., varying from 1200 to 3025 gin. The average amount of inoculum was 0.46 cc. of Type I I I pneumococcus culture. In the fatal cases the average duration of the disease was 3 days. In 2 of the group, only one pulmonary lobe was involved; in the others three or more lobes were affected. In 6 of the 8 cases, Pneumococcus III was recovered from the pleural or pericardial fluid, or both. In 3 cases the septicemia was below 4000 colonies per 1 cc. of blood, in the remainder it ranged from 18,000 to innumerable colonies at the time treatment was begun. In inverse ratio to the degree of septicemia, the circulating leukocytes were severely depressed to 2000 or less per c.mm. The animals rapidly collapsed, and any therapeutic aid seemed hopeless.
The amount of enzyme administered varied from 130 units in 1 animal to 615 units in the recovered case. In 3 instances, only one dose of enzyme was given, and in 3 others repeated doses of relatively small amounts were given. In the latter animals, distinct effects were noted, and possibly with larger amounts of enzyme recoveries might have resulted.
Despite the forbidding aspects of the disease, one animal with involvement

of the right upper lobe and a septicemia of 3800 colonies at the time of the first treatment on the 2nd day recovered. In 2 cases with 18,000 and 25,000 colonies at the time treatment was begun, the septicemia was markedly reduced, the spread of the pneumonia checked, and life prolonged until the 5th and 4th days, respectively. In 2 others, although death occurred early, single treatments caused a marked diminution in the number of pneumococci in the circulating
blood.

The disease in this group of animals is much the same as that in the untreated (1) group with comparable septicemia, in which the mortality rate was 100 per cent. In comparing the degree of involvement in the two groups, the treated animals had, in a higher percentage, three or more lobes involved. However, animals suffering from pneumonia of such pronounced form are, because of the marked

DISCUSSION
The results of specific enzyme therapy in the experimental Type III pneumococcus pneumonia of monkeys have been presented. To evaluate the effects of treatment in the present series of animals, the results, as measured by recovery or death, may be compared with those in an untreated series of animals (1) included in the preceding paper (Table III). It must be borne in mind, however, that in a given experiment the animals which appeared sickest were selected for treatment. Of those animals, treated or not, in which no bac-

terial invasion of the blood was demonstrable, all recovered. In the group with pneumonia accompanied by septicemia of I to 250 colonies per cc. of blood, 45 per cent of the 20 untreated animals died, while all of the 15 treated monkeys recovered. Of the 12 untreated animals in the group with septicemia ranging from 250 to 2000 colonies per cc., 75 per cent died, whereas of 9 animals which received enzyme therapy, only I died, a mortality rate of I 1.I per cent. The final group includes the animals which suffered from an extremely pronounced form of infection, frequently with diffuse pneumonia, rapid exhaustion of

circulating leukocytes, septicemia of very high degree, and with a tendency to early death. In the 16 untreated animals of this group, the mortality rate was 100 per cent. Of 8 comparable monkeys to which enzyme was administered, 7 died, and 1, in which the septicemia reached 3800 colonies per cc. before treatment, recovered, a mortality rate of 87.5 per cent.
It can readily be seen that in the groups in which no invasion of the blood occurs, spontaneous recovery is to be uniformly expected, whereas in the extremely severe forms of the disease the great majority of animals are too completely prostrated to respond to any therapeutic

FRANCIS, TERRELL~ DUBOS, AND AVERY

665

aids. Consequently, the two intermediate groups appear to offer the best opportunity for studying the effects of enzyme therapy. Included in these groups in which septicemia ranged from 1 to 2000 colonies per cc. are 32 untreated monkeys of which 18 died (56.2 per cent), and 24 treated animals with only one death (4 per cent). Or, if one compares the results in all animals in which septicemia was present, 70.8 per cent of 48 untreated animals died, but only 25 per cent of the 32 treated animals.
In addition to the apparently beneficial effects of specific enzyme therapy as measured by survival or death of the animals, certain other favorable influences were observed. In a high percentage of cases in which extension of the pneumonic process was occurring at the time of treatment, the spreading promptly ceased following the initial injection of enzyme. Although the density of the area of consolidation might at first appear greater than before treatment, extension did not occur and resolution of the lesion soon began. This limitation of spread of the pneumonia was not infrequently noted in the severe cases before the bacteria were completely eliminated from the blood stream (Figs. 7 to 12). A comparison of the ultimate degree of pulmonary involvement in the treated and untreated cases (1) (Chart 1) reveals the fact that it was less, in general, in the former series. While in the treated cases the extension was apparently limited early, in the untreated animals extension of the pneumonia progressed, frequently with fatal results.
That the administration of enzyme promoted sterilization of the blood stream seems certain. In the milder cases this occurred quite rapidly. In animals in which the higher degrees of septicemia were present, there was rarely an increase, more regularly a prompt decrease in the number of pneumococci in the blood following the administration of enzyme. Even in cases which eventually terminated fatally, or in which extreme septicemia occurred early in the disease, cultures of the blood showed a marked reduction in the number of bacteria within 4 to 5 hours after the first treatment.
Simultaneously with limitation of the pneumonia, beginning resolution, and elimination of septicemia, a fall in temperature usually occurred. In fact, there was a tendency for the fever to subside concurrently with the cessation of pneumonic spread, even though

666

T Y P E III P N E U 3 ~ O C O C C U S PNEU3~ONIA. II

septicemia still persisted. Although a marked leukopenia was comparatively frequent at the time treatment was begun, the number of leukocytes rose with the beginning of recovery.
In fatal untreated cases with septicemia, a high incidence of positive cultures was obtained from pleural or pericardial fluids at autopsy. In many instances frank empyema or pericarditis was present. In the treated cases with severe infections which resulted fatally, the incidence of these complications was also high. In recovered animals of the treated series, therefore, a frequency of suppurative complications equal to that of the untreated animals might be expected. The fact that the treated animals which survived recovered without suppurative sequelae suggests that enzyme therapy either prevented the development of empyema and pericarditis or was therapeutically effective even in the presence of these complications.
As previously stated, many technical difficulties have been encountered in attempting to produce enzyme preparations of uniformly high therapeutic activity and purity. The different lots of enzyme have, as a result, been inconstant in both these respects. In some instances toxic effects, attributable to impurities in the material, have been noted in animals after the administration of enzyme. These impurities may induce a febrile reaction and a decrease in the white blood count of the animal. At other times, when the animal is extremely ill with subnormal temperature and a marked leukopenia, the administration of impure preparations may produce a further depression of temperature and of the leukocytes.
The results of the present study indicate that the specific enzyme, even in its present state of purity, exerts a favorable therapeutic effect upon the course and outcome of experimental Type III pneumococcus pneumonia in monkeys. Nevertheless, the present study again emphasizes the therapeutic limitations of the enzyme (4). The action of the enzyme is known to be exerted upon the capsular polysaccharide of Type I I I Pneumococcus (6). By being deprived of its capsule, the bacterium is made susceptible to phagocytosis by the cells of the animal body. However, when the disease process is of extreme severity and the entire cellular mechanism of the body is markedly depressed, the animal may no longer possess the capacity to dispose of the organisms rendered vulnerable by the specific action of the enzyme.

SUMMARY
The effects of specific enzyme therapy upon experimental Type III pneumococcus pneumonia in monkeys were studied by comparing the course and outcome of the disease in treated animals with that in animals which received no therapeutic aid. Enzyme treatment was found to exert a distinctly favorable influence upon the experimental pneumonia. Treatment was followed by cessation of spread of the pneumonic lesion, sterilization of the blood, and early recovery, except in animals in which the severity of the disease was extreme. While in the untreated animals a high incidence of empyema and pericarditis was observed, suppurative sequelae were apparently prevented by adequate enzyme therapy. The limitations of the therapeutic action of the specific enzyme in the presence of marked depression of the cellular reaction in infected animals are again emphasized.

Abstract
Background: The impact of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) use on stenting has shown inconclusive results.
Objective: Systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of IVUS on stenting regarding the clinical and angiographic evolution.
Methods: A search was performed in Medline/Pubmed, CENTRAL, Embase, Lilacs, Scopus and Web of Science databases. It included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that evaluated the implantation of stents guided by IVUS, compared with those using angiography alone (ANGIO). The minimum follow-up duration was six months and the following outcomes were assessed: thrombosis, mortality, myocardial infarction, percutaneous and surgical revascularization, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and restenosis. The binary outcomes were presented considering the number of events in each group; the estimates were generated by a random effects model, considering MantelHaenszel statistics as weighting agent and magnitude of effect for the relative risk (RR) with its respective 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Higgins I2 test was used to quantify the consistency between the results of each study.
Results: A total of 2,689 articles were evaluated, including 8 RCTs. There was a 27% reduction in angiographic restenosis (RR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54-0.97, I² = 51%) and statistically significant reduction in the rates of percutaneous revascularization and overall (RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.51 to 1.53, I² = 61%, RR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54 to 0.99, I2 = 55%), with no statistical difference in surgical revascularization (RR: 0.95, 95%CI: 0.52-1.74, I2 = 0%) in favor of IVUS vs. ANGIO. There were no differences regarding the other outcomes in the comparison between the two strategies.
Conclusion: Angioplasty with stenting guided by IVUS decreases the rates of restenosis and revascularization, with no impact on MACE, acute myocardial infarction, mortality or thrombosis outcomes. (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2013;101(2):106-116)

Introduction
The intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is an invasive access technique that allows the dynamic acquisition of tomographic imaging, in vivo, of the vascular lumen and wall, being considered one of the best invasive imaging methods for the analysis of characteristics (qualitative and quantitative) of coronary atherosclerosis1,2.
In theory, the use of IVUS could improve the long-term results of angioplasty with stent implantation. These better results derive from at least three factors: the confirmation that there is no significant residual stenosis or that artery

dissection did not occur; definite identification and removal of the calcified plaque that limits stent expansion; visualization of an optimal luminal gain.
Studies that evaluated the potential benefit of percutaneous procedures guided by IVUS, when compared with those that used only angiography (ANGIO) in reducing restenosis, were inconclusive in demonstrating greater efficacy3-9.
In addition, more recent data suggests that the use of IVUS can prevent thrombosis of drug-eluting stents10.
Performing percutaneous interventions for the implantation of drug-eluting stents guided by IVUS, which allow the identification and subsequent treatment of risk factors for in-stent restenosis, as well as for early thrombosis, remains a controversial issue when compared to the performance of percutaneous interventions guided by ANGIO.
In the last decade, several randomized studies investigated the routine use of IVUS in stent implantation; however, the results have been inconclusive3-9.
In this study, we evaluated the impact of the routine use of IVUS in stenting through a systematic review with metaanalysis, regarding the clinical and angiographic evolution.

This study followed the guidelines for performing systematic reviews proposed by the Cochrane Collaboration, as well as other recommendations for systematic reviews11-13.
We focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared coronary angioplasties with stenting using IVUS, with angioplasties guided by angiography only (ANGIO), with a follow-up period of at least six months.
The following outcomes were assessed: thrombosis, mortality, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), percutaneous and surgical revascularization, restenosis and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), according to the definition of each study. Despite minor variations on the definition of MACE, most studies defined them as the combined endpoint of mortality (AMI) and the need for any other revascularization procedure during follow-up. Whenever possible, and when reported by the studies, clinical outcomes that comprised the combined endpoint were evaluated individually.
Article search was carried out comprehensively in the following electronic databases: Medline / Pubmed, CENTRAL, Embase, Lilacs, Scopus and Web of Science. There was no language restriction and the databases were searched from the date of availability up to November 2010. Previous reviews were consulted for identification and possible addition of other relevant studies.
The strategies were designed, whenever possible, using the controlled vocabulary of subject key words (Mesh / Medline, Emtree / Embase and DeCs / BVS). In addition, we used Word text words, synonyms and syntaxes combined with the Boolean operators "OR" for addition and "AND" for list of terms. The subject key words of the MESH / Medline strategy were sensitized by the addition of the "entry terms".
The main terms used in the search were: "Ultrasonography", "Ultrasonography, Interventional", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Angioplasty", "Coronary Angiography", "Coronary Angiography, transluminal percutaneous" and their equivalent in Portuguese language.
The filter used for the identification of randomized clinical trials only was prepared by Cochrane, with high sensitivity.
The sum of the database article search totaled 2,689 articles. Initially, 518 references were excluded, as they were in duplicate. The remaining 2,171 references had their eligibility confirmed by reading titles and abstracts (when available).
Two independent reviewers performed the selection. Articles suggestive of inclusion or that did not have an Abstract, but had suggestive titles, went to the next step of eligibility assessment through full-text reading.
At this phase, 57 articles had their eligibility assessed by reading the article in full-text form and guided by a standardized clinical record. When articles were excluded, the reasons for exclusion were recorded. Eight articles were selected for data extraction (Figure 1).
Statistical analysis was performed in two steps using the Metaview module of the Review Manager software program (RevMan 2000), created by Cochrane Collaboration11. At the first step, the descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics of patients was performed, as well as definitions of outcomes

and interventions used. The binary outcomes were obtained considering the number of events in each group. For binary outcomes, the estimates were generated by a random effects model, considering MantelHaenszel statistics as weighting agent and the magnitude of effect for the relative risk (RR) with its respective 95% confidence interval (95%CI).
To quantify the consistency between the results of each study, we used the test of inconsistency (I2) of Higgins.
The evaluation of the study quality involved an adequate random allocation sequence, blinding of investigators, blinding of participants, blinding of outcomes and use of intention-to-treat analysis.
The results were reported as "yes" "no", "unclear" and "not reported" and a qualitative assessment of the table generated by this information was performed. The quality of evidence generated by the meta-analysis for each outcome was assessed using the program GRADE profiler release 3.2.
For each outcome, the quality of evidence was evaluated by observing five aspects: (1) limitation of the study design; (2) consistency of results; (3) direct evidence; (4) precision; (5) potential publication bias.
Results
The results are shown and discussed in the tables and charts of meta-analyses. The characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 1.
The mortality outcome was assessed in all studies6,7,9,14-18. It was observed that IVUS-guided angioplasty were associated with a non-significant increase of 54% in mortality due to all causes: RR: 1.54, 95% CI: 0.85-2.78, I2 = 0 % (Figure 2). The quality of evidence evaluated by Grade was moderate, due to the fact that the effect estimates varied more than 25% between studies.
Seven articles6,7,14-18 assessed the AMI outcome. As not all the articles precisely defined the type of AMI, we chose in this study to describe the overall results, including those AMI with and without Q-wave. The performance of IVUSguided angioplasty was associated with a nonsignificant reduction of 27% in AMI (RR: 0.73; 95%CI: 0.43-1.16; I2=12%) (Figure 3).
The quality of evidence evaluated by Grade was low because the effect estimates varied more than 25% between studies and the study with the highest weight in the meta-analysis showed an opposite trend of effects, when compared to the other included studies, therefore generating inconsistency.
It was not possible to analyze the outcomes using target-lesion revascularization (TLR) and target-vessel revascularization (TVR) terminology, because definitions varied between studies. Furthermore, some studies indicated results in which the decrease in the number of revascularizations was highly significant, but without specifying whether the revascularization was surgical or percutaneous, as well as in which artery it was performed. Thus, we chose a more generic analysis, specified by type of intervention/procedure. Revascularization procedure was considered as the outcome, either surgical or by angioplasty.

There was a statistically significant reduction of 27% in the number of revascularizations in angioplasty guided by IVUS group (RR: 0.73, 95%CI: 0.54-0.99, I2 = 55%). There was also a non-significant reduction of revascularizations by angioplasty in the IVUS group (RR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.51-1.53, I2 = 61% (Figure 4).
The quality of evidence evaluated by Grade was moderate because the confidence intervals did not completely overlap between studies.
MACE were reported in seven studies6,7,14-18, with the AVID study also including the clinical outcome of stent thrombosis, which was not included in the others.
There was a non-significant reduction in MACE of 14% in the group with IVUS-guided angioplasty (RR: 0.86, 95%CI: 0.70-1.07, I2 = 55%) (Figure 5).

The quality of evidence evaluated by Grade was moderate because the confidence intervals did not completely overlap between studies.
Two studies15,16 reported the thrombosis outcome. IVUSguided angioplasty was associated with a nonsignificant reduction of 10% in cases of thrombosis (RR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.37-2.22, I2 = 0%) (Figure 6).
The quality of evidence evaluated by Grade was low because the two studies that reported this outcome showed opposite trends of effect measurement and only two studies reported data for this outcome.
Six studies6,7,9,14,17,18 reported the angiographic restenosis outcome. We detected a nonsignificant reduction of 27% in angiographic restenosis in the group with IVUS-guided angioplasty (RR: 0.73, 95%CI: 0.54-0.97, I2 = 51%) (Figure 7).

Discussion
This meta-analysis demonstrated that angioplasty with stenting guided by IVUS, when compared with those without IVUS, are associated with a significant reduction in the need for new revascularizations and occurrence of angiographic restenosis, also showing a nonsignificant reduction in MACE, myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis outcomes. However, they were associated with a non-significant increase in mortality from all causes.
The evaluation of the restenosis outcome was performed in six studies6,7,9,14,17,18. The occurrence of angiographic restenosis was lower in the group with IVUS-guided angioplasty in five of these studies. The reduction in restenosis ranged from 64%18 to 18%14.
Suboptimal stent expansion resulted in reduced crosssectional stent area observed at IVUS, being one of the most important predictors of restenosis after bare-metal stent implantation19.

Considering these findings, several studies have assessed whether the routine use of IVUS during stent implantation would result in clinical benefit, thus leading to the reduction of in-stent restenosis rate.
The first of these studies was a multicenter study that compared angioplasty guided by IVUS or ANGIO. The benefit of using IVUS was observed in the early phase of the study, when the group that used IVUS had a higher post-dilatation when using larger balloons (restenosis at six months was 9.2% vs. 22%, p = 0.04). However, there was no difference in angiographic restenosis at six months, in the late phase of the study, when an approach with lower post-dilation was used due to the changes in the definition of optimal stent expansion (22% vs. 23.7%, p = 1.0). Despite being a non-randomized observational study, it demonstrated for the first time that stenting guided by IVUS could result in a strategy that would improve patient outcome3.
Then, several small prospective studies indicated the superiority of the IVUSguided angioplasty over angioplasty guided by ANGIO, with a reduced restenosis rate at the sixmonth follow-up.

The RESIST (REStenosis after IVUS-guided Stenting) study was the first randomized study to investigate the impact of IVUS on the evolution of patients undergoing ANGIO. Although it analyzed only 155 patients, the study reported a tendency to a lower rate of restenosis at the six-month followup in the group that underwent angioplasty guided by IVUS9.
These results were also observed by Blasini et al4, who showed a significant reduction in the rate of restenosis at the six-month follow-up of patients that used IVUS (20.9% vs. 29.9%, p = 0.03), with the difference being particularly important in the group that met criteria for optimal stent release, when compared to those that did not meet these criteria (13.6% vs. 28.3%, p = 0.04)4.
The OPTICUS (OPTimization with IVUS to reduce stent restenosis) study was the largest randomized study to evaluate the use of IVUS to reduce the rate of instent restenosis. The primary study objective was the rate of instent restenosis, the lowest luminal diameter and percent of stenosis at the six-month follow-up. The secondary objective was the rate of MACE at six and twelve

months of follow-up. No difference was observed in any of the objectives between the two groups, suggesting the nonsuperiority of IVUS use in stenting6.
The TULIP (The Thrombocyte activity evaluation and effects of Ultrasound guidance in Long Intracoronary stent Placement) study7 randomly compared stent implantation guided by IVUS or ANGIO in long lesions (> 20 mm). Benefits were observed in the IVUS-guided group, which was considered at high risk for in-stent restenosis. In general, these studies did not clearly report that the routine use of IVUS in stenting was able to reduce in-stent restenosis rates.
These results are probably related to certain factors observed in these studies, such as the role of high-pressure insufflation to prevent inadequate stent expansion (which is related to restenosis), which was gradually incorporated into clinical practice, thus reducing potential IVUS benefits.
Drug-eluting stents are superior to bare-metal ones regarding restenosis rates and subsequent revascularization procedures8,20.

Despite these advantages, restenosis has not been eliminated and TLR rates reach 10% within two years of evolution19. The increased use of drug-eluting stents in patients with more severe and complex lesions has resulted in a significant increase in restenosis rates, greater than that observed in randomized trials21.
Given the encouraging results observed with the performance of IVUS-guided angioplasty with baremetal

stents, studies were designed to evaluate its role in angioplasties using drug-eluting stents.
Inadequate stent expansion has been reported as the predominant mechanism of restenosis in drug-eluting stents. With the suppression of myointimal proliferation achieved with drug-eluting stents, inadequate stent expansion became the main mechanism in the occurrence of restenosis22.

In a study of 499 patients (543 lesions), followed by six months with angiographic control after drug-eluting stent implantation, the minimum stent area after the procedure and stent length at the IVUS were predictors for restenosis of DES23.
The cutoff points that determined restenosis were a minimum stent area of 5.5 mm and length of 40 mm.
Similar results were observed in a study that used IVUS for DES implantation and assessed 33 lesions with 26 intra-stent restenosis, showing a minimum stent area of 5.0 mm in 67% of restenosis cases24.
In another study that used IVUS for DES implantation, 82% of restenosis cases showed a minimum post-procedural area < 5 mm, also showing cross-sectional areas < 3 and 4 mm25.
These studies suggest an association between a minimum cross-sectional stent area and occurrence of restenosis. Moreover, the higher the minimum cross-sectional area after the procedure, the lower the occurrence of restenosis.
The lack of adequate lesion coverage may also contribute to restenosis of drug-eluting stents. In a substudy of the SIRIUS study, the edges of 167 stents were studied, and 18 edge stenoses were identified during an eight-month angiographic follow-up, suggesting that inadequate plaque coverage may determine stent edge stenosis, which could be prevented by using IVUS26.
The result of this meta-analysis is consistent with a metaanalysis performed by Casella et al27, who detected a significant reduction of 19% in the angiographic restenosis outcome.
The revascularization outcome evaluation was performed in seven studies6,7,14-18, and showed a significant reduction of 27% in the need for revascularization in the IVUS group, when analyzing together angioplasty or surgical revascularization.
The occurrence of revascularization was significantly lower in the group with IVUS-guided angioplasty in five of these studies. This reduction ranged from 60%7 to 32%16, and remained when considering only revascularizations with angioplasty, whereas in the surgical revascularization group there were fewer procedures in the IVUS group, but without statistical significance.
The evaluation of the new revascularization outcome among several studies shows some difficulties:
1st. It must to be expressed regarding the vessel that was revascularized and not another blocked vessel;
2nd. It is necessary to differentiate between percutaneous and surgical revascularization.
This occurs with revascularization because some studies show results in which the decrease in the number of revascularizations is highly significant, without specifying whether it is percutaneous or surgical and in which artery it was performed.
Revascularization was considered as clinical necessity or need for revascularization procedure, either surgical or by angioplasty. It was not possible to analyze outcomes using the TLR and TVR terminology, because definitions varied between studies. Thus, a more generic analysis was chose, specified by type of intervention / procedure.

The results of this study are consistent with those found in another meta-analysis27, which showed a significant reduction relevant to the need for revascularization in the group with IVUS-guided angioplasty, mainly the reduction of revascularizations by angioplasty.
There was a non-significant decrease of the outcomes: myocardial infarction, MACE and stent thrombosis in the group with IVUS-guided angioplasty.
The definition of MACE varies from study to study, but in most of them it is a combination of death, nonfatal AMI, and TVR. Some studies, however, include new revascularization by angioplasty or surgical revascularization and subacute stent thrombosis.
A recent meta-analysis27 showed a significant reduction in MACE (18.7% vs. 15%, p < 0.03) in favor of the group submitted to IVUS. This difference was primarily due to the reduction of in TVR observed in the IVUS group.
These results are consistent with those found in the present study, which detected a 14% MACE reduction in the IVUS group. Although TVR rates were not specifically determined, a significant decrease in new revascularizations, both by angioplasty and surgical revascularizations, of 27% in the IVUS group, contributed to this reduction in MACE.
Two studies15,16 evaluated the outcome of stent thrombosis with nonsignificant reduction of 10% in favor of the IVUS group. This result is consistent with those of Casella et al27, who observed nonsignificant reduction of 12% of subacute thrombosis in the IVUS group. The subacute stent thrombosis was an initial limitation to stent implantation, with an incidence of 10-15%28,29. The use of dual antiplatelet therapy and high-pressure stent implantation reduced the rate of thrombotic events after angioplasty to 0.9 %30.
The first study using IVUS to evaluate subacute stent thrombosis observed that a smaller lumen and post-procedure dissection were independent predictors for this outcome in univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively31.
A multicenter registry was performed to evaluate the role of IVUS in predicting stent thrombosis when compared to angiography. This study included patients who had stent thrombosis after angioplasty guided by IVUS.
At least one abnormal finding observed by IVUS (bad stent placement, dissection, thrombus or inadequate expansion) was present in 94% of 53 patients studied. Angiographic changes were present in only 32% of patients. These findings suggest that the use of IVUS was superior to angiography during angioplasty with implantation of stents32. However, there has been no study evaluating whether the routine use of IVUS decreases the rates of stent thrombosis.
In a recent registry, when evaluating patients undergoing angioplasty with implantation of drug-eluting stents, patients who underwent IVUS-guided angioplasty were compared with those guided by ANGIO. There was a significant reduction in sub-acute thrombosis (0.5% vs. 1.4%, p < 0.045), as well as at the end of the twelve-month follow-up (0.7% vs. 2%, p < 0.014) in the group that used IVUS10.

There have been few studies evaluating IVUS findings in patients with late stent thrombosis. The late stent thrombosis mechanisms are multifactorial and the findings observed during the procedure do not correlate with late events. A case-control study showed a high prevalence of bad stent placement in patients with late thrombosis (> 12 months)33.
The incidence of incomplete stent apposition was 77% in late thrombosis and 12% in the control group (p < 0.001). Although the association between bad stent placement and late thrombosis remains controversial, the use of IVUS during angioplasty may prevent bad stent placement, which would reduce late stent thrombosis.
Our data are consistent with two recent meta-analyses: the one performed by Parise et al34, with similar results, differing only regarding the benefit observed in the use of IVUS in reducing the incidence of MACE (OR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.52-0.99), which was not demonstrated in this analysis. As for the meta-analysis performed by Sbruzzi et al35, the results of this study are similar.
Conclusion
The use of IVUS when performing angioplasty compared with angioplasty guided by quantitative ANGIO, shows a statistically significant decrease in the need for new revascularization and angiographic restenosis.
Its use is not associated with a statistically significant difference in mortality, thrombosis, myocardial infarction and MACE outcomes when compared to angioplasty with stenting performed without IVUS.
There were no clear clinical benefits regarding the routine use of IVUS to guide the performance of angioplasties with stent implantation.

The definitive confirmation of the data presented here requires the performance of randomized clinical trials in a new scenario of drug-eluting stents and use of potent antiplatelet strategies after stenting.

Abstract

Background: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common cutaneous neoplasm in human beings. Ultraviolet radiation is one of the most important predisposing factors for BCC. Although some recent investigations have shown a high serum level of phospholipids in actinic keratosis and BCC, this subject is still debated and needs approval. This study aimed to evaluate the association between serum lipid level and development of cutaneous BCC.
Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, lipid profile including triglyceride (TG), Cholesterol (CHOL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were measured in 30 patients with BCC and 30 healthy controls. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistical tests including t tests and Chi square test.
Results: This study shows that the mean age of the case and control groups were 63.93 ± 12.09 and 61.57 ± 21.1 years (mean ± SD), respectively. The average amount of triglyceride, cholesterol, HDL and LDL in the BCC patients were 139.73 ± 69.11 mg/dl, 179.20 ± 43.42 mg/dl, 39.40 ± 9.30 mg/dl and 110.70 ± 34.13 mg/dl, respectively, whereas these amounts in the control group were 141.83 ± 80.41 mg/dl, 173.60 ± 96.32 mg/dl, 36.97 ± 6.35 mg/dl, 110.70 ± 34.13 mg/dl and 104.87 ± 30.85 mg/dl, respectively. No significant difference was found in the lipid profile of the case and control groups (P > 0.05%).
Conclusion: This study shows that the serum lipid levels in patients with BCC has no significant difference in comparison with the control group and, therefore, relevance between BCC and serum lipid level is not proven. Further studies with a larger sample size are necessary for evaluating this subject.

INTRODUCTION
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common cutaneous cancer in humans, comprising 75-80% of skin cancers.[1] The history of childhood sunburn and intermittent exposure to sunlight has an important role in increasing its incidence.[2,3] The incidence of BCC also increases with age.[4] Apart from the exposure to

ultraviolet radiation, which is the single most important risk factor for developing skin cancers,[5] there are some other known risk factors such as lymphoma/leukemia, AIDS and other immune-compromised conditions, radiotherapy, X-ray exposure, arsenic toxicity, infection with human papilloma virus, stasis dermatitis, scar due to thermal burn and Plus long-wave ultraviolet light (PUVA) therapy.[1,6] Alterations in plasma lipids and lipoproteins have been reported in association with some skin cancers.[7] Additionally, more content of phospholipids and cholesterol in cancerous and pre-cancerous lesions of the skin have been found compared with normal tissue. Based on these findings, it has been hypothesized that a high-fat diet may have a role in developing squamous cell carcinoma,[8] although there is still some controversy.[9] The aim of our study was to evaluate the lipid profile in patients with BCC, trying to find any association between abnormal lipid profile and BCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
One group of 30 patients with BCC and one group of 30 healthy adults were enrolled in the study. Patients with BCC were randomly selected from those referred to our Department of Dermatology during Jan to Mar 2008 if they had no history of hyperlipidemia, smoking, obesity, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus and Cushing's syndrome. Patients with long-term use of corticosteroids and other drugs (e.g., Estrogens) effective in lipid profile were not included in the study. The control group consisted of healthy adults with no history of skin cancers, with the similar inclusion criteria to the case group. The two groups were matched by age, sex and weight.
The purpose of the study was explained to each of the participants and a consent form was obtained from all of them. At first, physical examination was performed by a dermatologist and demographic information such as age, sex, duration and location of BCC lesions were recorded in designed forms. Then, 5 cc venous blood was taken from each participant (after 8-12 h of fasting) for measuring the serum lipid profile (TG, CHOL, HDL and LDL) by a photometric assay method. Normal range values and the amount of cut-off point for the lipids laboratory tests, according to the kit manufacturer, were as follows: TG <200 mg/dl, CHOL <200 mg/dl, HDL >35 mg/dl and LDL <130 mg/dl. Biopsy specimens from suspicious lesions were obtained for pathological confirmation. Statistical program SPSS version 16 for windows was used for data analysis. Mean values of each lipid profile were calculated in each group. Then, the lipid profile values were tested by Student's t-test between the two groups. P values less than 0.05 were considered as being significant.

RESULTS
The case group consisted of 16 males (53%) and 14 females, with a mean age of 63.93 ± 12.09 years (range 40-83 years). The control group included 17 males (56.7%) and 13 females (43.3%), with a mean age of 61.57 ± 6.67 years (range 38-78 years) (P > 0.05). The most common anatomical location of BCC was on the head and neck (24 cases, 80%). Other common sites of BCC were four - upper chest, three - upper limbs and one - lower limb lesions. The average of the TG level in the BCC and control groups was 139.73 ± 69.11 mg/dl and 141.83 ± 80.41 mg/dl, respectively (P = 0.341). There was no significant difference of the mean values of cholesterol level between the two groups (179.20 ± 43.42 mg/dl vs. 173.60 ± 96.32 mg/dl, P = 0.794). Although patients with BCC had higher mean values of HDL (39.40 ± 9.30 mg/dl) than healthy individuals (36.97 ± 6.35 mg/dl), the observed difference was not significant (P = 0.804). Similar results were observed regarding LDL levels (110.70 ± 34.13 mg/dl vs. 104.87 ± 30.85 mg/dl, P = 0.396). Table 1 demonstrates the mean values in the two groups.
DISCUSSION
Lipids play an important role in cellular integrity and action. Phospholipids are the main lipids in the cell membrane, while triglycerides are stored as cell energy reservoirs. LDL, synthesized mainly in the liver, is transported in the blood stream for supplying triglycerides and cholesterol in cells experiencing an LDL receptor. HDL returns cholesterol mainly to the liver.
Because of the role of lipid profile in maintenance of cell integrity and various biological functions, including cell growth and division (normal and malignant tissues), the changes in lipid profile may have an association with cancer. BCC, which is the most common skin cancer, has been reported to be associated with some disturbances in the serum lipid profile.[10]
In our present study, serum analysis showed no difference of mean values of lipid profile between groups of patients with BCC and healthy adults. Although we could not find any changes in the lipid profiles of patients with BCC, Vural et al.,[10]

based on a prospective case-control study, reported that the levels of all lipid fractions were increased in both actinic keratosis (AK) and BCC. They also stated that serum cholesterol in BCC patients was significantly lower and serum phospholipid levels were significantly higher than those in the AK group. They concluded that an increase in the metabolically active serum phospholipids fraction is reflected in elevated neoplastic tissue phospholipids. Another study performed on patients with various malignancies revealed that total lipids, cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels were inversely associated with the incidence of cancer, whereas triglyceride levels were significantly elevated in patients with cancer.[11] Chawda et al. also found an inverse relationship between lipid levels and occurrence of oral cancer, concluding that lower plasma lipid concentrations may be a useful indicator for detecting the initial changes observed in neoplastic processes.[9] Microscopic changes are likely to be the first detected changes in cancerous cells. One study showed that infrared spectroscopy of normal epidermis and basal cell carcinomas were significantly different by virtue of subtle differences in protein structure and nucleic acid content.[12] Some investigators reported a possible role of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxides in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, particularly cancers, revealing an inverse correlation between lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defense mechanisms.[13]
Lipid contents of the daily diet, including lipid-soluble vitamins, are studied in BCC pathology. It has been shown that plasma antioxidants are decreased in the pre-cancerous lesions of AK and BCC, probably due to the long exposure to UV irradiation that is one of the most important factors in the etiology of AK and BCC, although -tocopherol and RBC glutathione are most altered in BCC.[13] Heinen et al. surprisingly showed that dietary intake of antioxidants like vitamin C and vitamin E was associated with an increased BCC risk.[14] But, Van Dam et al. reported that intake of long-chain-3 fatty acids, retinol, vitamin C, vitamin D or vitamin E were not materially related to BCC risk.[15] Also, Hunter et al.[16] showed no significant association between risk of BCC and energy-adjusted intake of dietary fat, carotenoids with vitamin A activity and retinol, vitamin C, vitamin D and vitamin E, with or without supplements.
One limitation of our study was that only patients with BCC were included as cases. We did not consider other pre-neoplastic lesions such as AK. Special forms of BCC such as nevoid BCC syndrome, which presents with multiple lesions in the early ages, could get more information about the different lipid profile changes.

We also did not follow our sample for any changes during the recurrence period. Further studies with large clinical samples are needed for evaluating the lipid prolife among different populations of skin cancer patients.
Although slightly increased serum levels of cholesterol and LDL in patients with BCC have been observed, there was no statistically significant difference between patients and healthy individuals with respect to the concern of subscales of lipid profile. Future studies are required to compare lipid profiles in different pre-cancerous and malignant forms of BCC.

UrbachWiethe Disease: A Rare Cause of Bilateral Mesial Temporal Lobe Involvement and Cerebral Hemorrhage

Dear Editor, Two siblings born from consanguineous parents were admitted to our hospital with the complaint of seizures. The seizures were in the form of unresponsiveness attacks that lasted less than 1 min. Before these seizures, the patients described an aura with an unusual bad smell. No ictal motor phenomenon was described.
The first patient was a 37yearold man. In addition to the seizures, he also had behavioral changes. The patient was no longer afraid of animals that he used to fear. He had irritability and aggressive behaviors, as well as increased libido and hypersexuality. He had sex with multiple partners multiple times despite being married. In his past medical history, he had a putaminal hemorrhage at the age of 33, despite not having hypertension or an aneurysm [Figure 1a]. The patient also had hoarseness since early childhood. His neurological examination was normal. On physical examination, he had alopecia. There were multiple papules on the eyelid margins and the malar region (moniliform blepharosis) [Figure 1b]. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed

bilateral, symmetrical calcification of the hippocampus and parahippocampal regions, which had a hypointense appearance on T1 and Fluidattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences [Figure 1c and d]. Cranial MRI features were compatible with UrbachWiethe disease. Extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) gene mutation was shown by genetic testing. Electroencephalography (EEG) did not show any abnormalities.
The second patient was a 23yearold man. Although he did not have any neuropsychological complaints, he had hoarseness and alopecia. His neurological examination was normal. He also had bilateral, symmetrical calcification of the hippocampus and parahippocampal regions [Figure 2]. The genetic testing showed ECM1 gene mutation. EEG did not show any abnormalities.
Valproic acid was the preferred drug for the patients. The seizures were controlled with valproic acid therapy.
UrbachWiethe disease (also known as lipoid proteinosis; hyalinosis cutis et mucosae) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in ECM1.[1] ECM1 is an extracellular protein

that takes part in angiogenesis.[1] Autopsy studies have shown calcified vessel walls and gliotic tissues in the amygdala.[1] Bilateral symmetrical temporal lobe calcification can be seen in up to 75% of patients with UrbachWiethe disease.[1] Temporal lobe calcifications are visible on T1, T2, and FLAIR images.[1]
Epilepsy and behavioral changes are the most common neurological manifestations.[2] The most common seizure type is focal seizures with impaired awareness, which may manifest as motionless staring with an epigastric aura.[2] The neuropsychological findings are aggressive behavior, anxiety, hypersexuality, and decreased ability to identify emotional expressions.[3] The neuropsychological findings and radiologic findings can evolve over time.[1,3] Valproic acid is one of the effective drugs in temporal lobe epilepsy.[4] Also preferred was valproic acid, so as to take advantage of its impulse control effect.[5]
UrbachWiethe disease is associated with intracerebral hemorrhage.[6,7] A small number of UrbachWiethe disease patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were reported in the past.[6,7] Patients may develop a large brain hematoma or small cerebral hemorrhages.[6,7] The ECM1 gene is expressed around the vessels.[8] The ECM1 protein stimulates blood vessel formation.[1] Mutations in the ECM1 gene cause a glycoprotein deposition and calcium mass in the vessels.[1,8] Moreover, it reduces collagen protein expression and stimulates the overexpression of noncollagenous proteins.[8] These alterations affect the structure of the vessel walls and may explain the intracerebral hemorrhage risk in patients with UrbachWiethe disease.[1,8]
The disease also has a broad range of dermatological and head and neck symptoms.[1] Moniliform blepharosis is pathognomonic.[9] Neurologists should keep UrbachWiethe disease in mind due to its neurological manifestations, despite its rarity.

Female, 57-year-old Gallbladder volvulus Abdominal and/or epigastric pain -- Laparoscopic cholecystectomy Surgery
Rare disease Gallbladder torsion is a rare entity of acute abdomen that can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly. It presents in a multitude of ways but the most common is a presentation similar to acute cholecystitis. Diagnosis can be made clinically by abdominal ultrasound with Doppler flow, and treatment is detorsion with cholecystectomy. A 57-year-old female presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, and loose stools. An initial diagnosis of gastroenteritis was made, however, the patient did not respond to symptomatic treatment and continued having pain, nausea and vomiting. Abdominal ultrasound revealed signs of acute cholecystitis and the patient underwent an open cholecystectomy where the gallbladder was found to be black, gangrenous, and voluminous due to torsion. Detorsion and cholecystectomy were performed without any complications. Gallbladder torsion is a rare entity of acute abdomen that can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Gallbladder torsion should be a part of the differential diagnosis of any patient presenting with an acute abdomen and unusual symptoms of acute cholecystitis.

Background
Gallbladder torsion with resulting volvulus is a rare entity of acute abdomen. It was first described in 1898 by Wendel in a 25-year-old pregnant woman [1]. Since then, over 500 cases of gallbladder torsion have been reported with an incidence of approximately 1 in 356 000 hospital admissions [2]. The most common presentation of gallbladder volvulus is that of acute cholecystitis, and a preoperative diagnosis of gallbladder volvulus is rarely made [3]. Unlike acute cholecystitis, gallbladder volvulus carries the risk of perforation [4], thus early diagnosis and prompt treatment of gallbladder volvulus is imperative, as it decreases mortality and morbidity from a perforated gallbladder and ensuing peritonitis [3,4]. In this report we present a case of gallbladder volvulus that initially presented as gastroenteritis then with the findings of acute cholecystitis on imaging.

Figure 1. Paramedian incision on the right below the costal margin, black gangrenous voluminous gallbladder was visualized.

Case Report
A 57-year-old female presented to the emergency department with severe upper abdominal pain, 2 episodes of bilious vomiting, and one episode of loose stools. The patient's only medical history is hypertension that is adequately controlled. On presentation she was hemodynamically stable and afebrile.
On physical examination the patient had a soft non-distended abdomen with normal bowel sounds; epigastric pain on deep palpation was noted as well as right upper quadrant tenderness, however Murphy's sign was negative. The patient's laboratory studies including leukocyte count, hepatic enzymes, and pancreatic enzymes were all within normal range.
An initial diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis was made based upon the patient's presentation with vomiting and loose stools, as such the patient was given symptomatic treatment. The patient had no relief from the pain and was given pethidine 75 mg subcutaneously, also without improvement in pain. Due to these unusual findings, the patient was admitted to the hospital for further workup. During this time the patient was still experiencing nausea and vomiting resistant to medications (metoclopramide and ondansetron).
An abdominal ultrasound was performed which showed findings of acute cholecystitis with microlithiasis without signs of dilation of intra or extra-hepatic bile ducts. A diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was made, and the patient was planned for cholecystectomy less than 24 hours of admission. An open approach was agreed upon due to the unusual presentation of resistant pain, recurrent vomiting, and a new finding on physical examination of a palpable mass in the right upper quadrant.

Figure 4. Gallbladder was separated from its hepatic attachment and excised. The common bile duct was observed with careful attention
Operative findings included a black, gangrenous, and voluminous gallbladder with a large mesentery displacing the gallbladder from the liver bed (Figures 1-4). A clockwise torsion around the gallbladder axis was noted, detorsion was done manually, and the cholecystectomy proceeded without any complications. The patient was discharged home on the third day following surgery.
Discussion
Gallbladder volvulus is a rare condition that might carry significant mortality risk if not identified and treated early on in its course. The frequency of this disease increases with age, with some reports stating an average age between 60 and 80 years old [5,6]. Gallbladder volvulus has a predilection among adult females with a female: male ratio of 4: 1, however, the reverse is true in the pediatric population with a female: male ratio of 1: 3 [6]. The literature reports a mortality rate up to 6% [6,7] if promptly treated and 100% if left untreated [3].
It is hypothesized that certain congenital gallbladder anomalies might predispose to torsion. Of particular importance is the free-floating gallbladders classified by Gross [8] into 2 types: type A where a long and wide mesentery supports both the gallbladder and the cystic duct, and type B, where an incomplete mesentery supports only the cystic duct. Four other anatomic variants of the gallbladder have been described that might increase the risk of gallbladder volvulus [3,5]. The first variant is a congenital anomaly where the pars cystica fails to migrate normally from the hepatic diverticulum during week 4 to week 7 of embryological development which causes a complete absence of the gallbladder mesentery. The result is

a free-floating gallbladder suspended by the cystic duct and artery alone. The second abnormality is a result of normal aging where the gallbladder mesentery elongates and becomes mobile; this combined with atrophy of the liver increases the risk of gallbladder torsion. The third anomaly is described as a detached fundus of the gallbladder from the liver bed, increasing its mobility and the risk of torsion. The fourth variant is also the rarest and is a normal gallbladder fixed to a mobile hepatic lobe. Volvulus might be complete (180° torsion or less) or incomplete (more than 180°) [9], and it might be clockwise or anticlockwise [6]. Our patient had a large and elongated gallbladder mesentery which is the result of normal aging and might have contributed to the clockwise torsion of the gallbladder.
Clinical presentation of gallbladder volvulus is non-specific and variable, it ranges from acute abdomen to chest pain, but most commonly present similarly to acute cholecystitis with right upper quadrant pain [5,9]. Presentation can be correlated with the type of torsion, recurrent episodes of incomplete torsion might lead to recurrent pain [3], as such a careful history must be obtained from the patient. Clinical symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and a palpable mass in the right quadrant [3-5,7,9]. A triple triad has been described to clinically differentiate between acute cholecystitis and gallbladder volvulus [3,5,7]; the first is patient characteristics where there is increased risk of torsion among the elderly, thin, or patients with spine deformities. The second triad is based on clinical symptoms of sudden onset pain, right upper quadrant pain, and emesis all of which favor gallbladder torsion. The third triad is of clinical signs seen on physical examination; a non-toxic appearing patient with pulse temperature discrepancy and a palpable mass in the right upper quadrant make the diagnosis of gallbladder torsion more likely. The case presented here is unusual, as the patient had signs and symptoms suggestive of gastroenteritis which is an extremely unusual presentation for gallbladder volvulus that has not been described in the literature.
Preoperative diagnosis of gallbladder volvulus has increased from 10% [3-5] to 26% [6], most likely due to advancements in imaging modalities. Ultrasound is the preferred modality, as a first line of imaging [3], to diagnose both acute cholecystitis and gallbladder volvulus, however distinguishing between these 2 entities might not always be possible, as both might show wall thickening and surrounding edema with gallstones [3-6], as was the case with our patient. Another differential diagnosis that can be made based on ultrasound findings is acalculous cholecystitis since gallbladder torsion might present with no gallstones [3-6]. Certain signs on ultrasound have been solely described in gallbladder torsion which might assist in diagnosis [3], these include a free-floating gallbladder detached from the liver bed or a floating gallbladder with

discontinuity of the lumen. Another finding described in gallbladder volvulus is the presence of a continuous hypoechoic zone between 2 echogenic areas which signifies venous and lymphatic stasis [3-5]. Doppler ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis by the absence of blood flow in the cystic artery [3-5], however this method is not routinely used probably due to the low index of suspicion for gallbladder torsion.
To be more precise ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) are the primary imaging approaches used for diagnosis. But the difference a CT scan can reveal a "floating gallbladder" with gallbladder wall thickening. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help with the imaging of a twisted cystic duct, and T2 weighted images are beneficial for evaluating necrosis of the gallbladder wall. Early diagnosis of gallbladder torsion can help to prevent life-threatening complications such as gallbladder gangrene, perforations causing bilious peritonitis, and other infections. For preventing this sequela, ultrasonography and CT are the primary imaging approaches. Early use of appropriate imaging prevents complications, reduces mortality and morbidity rates, and decreases hospitalization costs [10,11].
Treatment of gallbladder volvulus is emergency cholecystectomy, as delay in treatment might increase the risk of perforation, peritonitis, and death [3,4]. A laparoscopic approach has been described and is the preferred method for detorsion and cholecystectomy [3-5,7]. We opted for an open approach as the diagnosis was unclear and the patient had an unusual

presentation of what was presumed to be acute cholecystitis based on ultrasound. Percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder might sometime be wrongly performed due to the initial diagnosis of acute cholecystitis in an elderly patient with contraindications to laparoscopy [5]. Drainage should not be performed for gallbladder volvulus as it will only address the patient's symptoms, and the torsion will continue to exist further increasing the risk of perforation and peritonitis [4,5].
Conclusions
Gallbladder volvulus is an uncommon occurrence that is mainly seen among elderly women and is frequently undiagnosed preoperatively due to unspecific presentations that might mimic acute cholecystitis. Improvements in imaging modalities have assisted physicians in making the diagnosis of gallbladder volvulus; ultrasound is the modality of choice as a first line of imaging [3], and Doppler might be used if there is a high index of suspicion for gallbladder volvulus. Once the diagnosis of gallbladder volvulus is made, prompt treatment with laparoscopic cholecystectomy must be performed. Early detection and prompt treatment are imperative as delay in diagnosis might be fatal.

Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a neuroendocrine tumor that arises from the calcitonin (CT)-producing thyroid parafollicular C cells, accounting for 3-4% of all thyroid cancers [1, 2]. CT constitutes the most specific and sensitive serum biomarker of MTC and correlates with tumor size [3], whereas different markers markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and chromogranin A (CgA), are specific but often co-secreted by the tumor [2, 3]. Compared with other thyroid malignancies, MTC exhibits distinctive histopathological features, and the most important immunohistochemical markers are CT and CEA; in fact, in the absence of CT expression, the diagnosis of MTC should be questioned [4]. Also, amyloid material is often present at the histological examination [4]. Calcitonin-negative medullary thyroid cancer (CNMTC), determined by normal serum levels of CT, is a very rare presentation of MTC and only a few cases have been described in the literature [5]. Moreover, CNMTC is often positive for CT immunostaining [6]. In the current case, we report a CNMTC with negative CT, CEA and amyloid substance at the histopathological examination.
A 44-year-old woman presented with asymptomatic neck swelling that was perceived 3 months before. She was receiving atenolol 50 mg once daily to treat high blood pressure and had no personal or family history of thyroid disease or cancer. She did not report any toxic habit. Physical examination revealed an approximately 30 × 20 mm nodule in the left thyroid lobule that moved upwards with swallowing and presented tender consistency. Thyroid stimulating hormone, peripheral thyroid hormones and thyroid peroxidase antibody levels were normal. Ultrasound (US) examination of the neck showed a 30 × 12 × 17 mm well-defined homogeneous hypoechoic solid nodule on the left thyroid lobule with peripheral and central vascularization. No pathological lymph nodes were identified.
According to these findings, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology was performed, showing the presence of a significant number of single follic-

ular cells coexisting with 3D groups of overlapping follicular cells (follicular neoplasm or suspicious for a follicular neoplasm, Bethesda category IV). Consequently, the patient underwent a diagnostic left hemithyroidectomy. Histopathological features were consistent with the presence of a MTC (Figures 1, 2). Despite negative staining for CT, CEA and amyloid substance, epithelial tumor markers (cytokeratins) and neuroendocrine markers (CgA, neuron-specific enolase and synaptophysin) demonstrated strong diffuse staining, whereas the thyroglobulin expression result was negative (Table I).
Additional tests were performed after these results. Whole-body computed tomography did not show any alteration, while somatostatin receptor scintigraphy with 111In-DTPA-octreotide (Octreoscan) only revealed physiological captation in the right thyroid lobule. In the blood test, CT levels were undetectable (< 2 pg/ml, reference range < 10 pg/ml), while CEA (0.22 ng/ml, reference range < 5 ng/ml), CgA (6.2 ng/ml, reference range < 100 ng/ml) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (3.56 mg/day, reference range < 10 mg/day) levels were within the normal limits. The serum level of thyroglobulin was 12 ng/ml (reference range: 3.5- 77 ng/ml). RET genetic screening was negative.

Two months after left hemithyroidectomy, completion thyroidectomy was undertaken. Histopathological evaluation of the right thyroid lobe did not reveal any alteration. Follow-up CT and CEA have remained undetectable and within normal levels, respectively, while US of the neck have not shown signs of local recurrence recurrence after surgery (13 years of follow-up). Periodic computed tomography of the thorax and abdomen did not show evidence of disease.
MTC is an uncommon form of thyroid cancer derived from C cells that is mainly characterized by secretion of CT, a biomarker that constitutes the cornerstone of MTC diagnosis and follow-up [2]. CNMTC is an extremely rare entity and only a few cases have been previously reported. The first case of CNMTC was described by Sobol et al. [7], who identified a thyroid tumor with low levels of serum CT, focal amyloid-like deposits and CT-negative, CgA-positive, CEA-positive immunostaining.
A recent systematic review documented 19 articles including a total of 49 patients with pathological diagnosis of MTC without raised serum levels of CT [6]. Among them, 21 of the 38 cases tested for CT at immunohistochemistry (IHQ) were

found to be positive, while CgA-positive staining was found in all the examined cases. Therefore, it is important to note that despite low or normal levels of CT, a significant number of CNMTC presented positivity for CT at IHQ, a fact that has prompted several hypotheses about the pathogenesis of CNMTC, from CT assay interferences to impaired CT secretion by the tumor [8, 9]. In our case, serum levels of CT were not assessed before surgery, since the diagnosis of a MTC was not suspected by the FNA cytopathology. In this sense, discordant FNA interpretation and surgical findings of MTC have been reported in the literature, especially when samples combine preserved cellular cohesion and lack of classic nuclear features of MTC [10]. Importantly, our case presented CT-negative staining in IHQ, which suggests that not only could serum CT secretion mechanisms be altered, but also an impairment in CT synthesis by tumoral cells may be present [11]. In addition, amyloid deposits and CEA were not expressed by the tumor in the current case; consequently, immunohistochemical markers of neuroendocrine differentiation (CgA, neuron-specific enolase and synaptophysin) allowed the diagnosis of MTC. Diffuse or focal positivity for CEA has been reported in almost half of the cases in the literature, while most of them were tumors with amyloid deposits [6]. In fact, in the largest series of CNMTC, nearly 60% of patients presented amyloid deposition in the histopathological evaluation, in spite of the fact that some of them tested negative for CT in IHQ [12]. Amyloid deposition is a distinctive feature of MTC and CT is the only component of this substance [13]; thus alternately processed prohor-

mone of CT or aberrant CT may play a role in the aforementioned cases.
Some authors have argued that the absence of CT secretion implies poor differentiation of the tumor, which may be a sign of adverse prognosis, especially among tumors with CT-negative IHQ [14], although recent studies have shown a very variable prognosis [6]. Our case expressed a low Ki67 proliferation index, and there was no evidence of regional or distant disease postoperatively;

therefore, central lymph node dissection was not performed along with the completion thyroidectomy [4]. In addition, the patient has remained free of disease to date. As regards follow-up, there is no widespread agreement over the most appropriate surveillance strategy. Several authors suggest monitoring serum levels of CT and CEA [15], while neck US, computed tomography and magnetic resonance are the recommended options to detect structural recurrence. Conversely, studies differ about the utility of fluorodeoxyglucose/ fluorine 18-dihydroxyphenialanine PET/computed tomography [4, 9].
In conclusion, we report atypical histopathological features in a very unusual form of MTC. These findings reveal that the absence of traditional markers, such as CT, CEA and amyloid deposits, at the pathological evaluation does not rule out the diagnosis of MTC. Also, these characteristics do not seem to determine a worse prognosis.

Abstract
Aim: The aim of this study was to provide insight about all the common fascial space infections of the neck, their presentation, their etiology, complaints, length of stay, and the treatment given. Patients and Methods: It was conducted in a tertiary center in Nadiad, Gujarat, India. A total of 1034 patients were treated for fascial space infections of the neck in the hospital from 2001 to 2017. There were 63.24% male and 36.75% female with age ranging from 21 days to 96 years having the mean age of 31.4 years. Results: Odontogenic infection with poor oral hygiene as a cause was found in most (78.43%) of the abscesses. Diabetes was the most common comorbid condition found in 98 (9.47%) patients along with HIV found in ten (0.96%) patients. Pain (99.41%), fever (86.07%), swelling (86.94%), and dysphagia/odynophagia (67.21%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Ludwig's angina and submandibular abscess were found to be the most common deep headandneck space infection making up for 52% cases. The most common group of microorganisms isolated were Streptococcus sp. (19.82%) and Staphylococcus aureus (18.66%). Conclusion: Treatment was given in the form of incision and drainage of the abscesses (83.69%) and systemic antibiotics (100%). The most common space infection among the deep neck infections is the submandibular space infection (52%). If the etiological factor was not removed which mostly was carious teeth, high chances of recurrence were found (27.27%). Four patients required tracheostomy, and there was one mortality in the entire series.

Introduction
Acute cervical space infection occurring in the fascial spaces of the neck is a common occurrence in rural areas where dental hygiene is poor. Previously, tonsillar and paratonsillar areas were common sites from which infections used to spread to the deep neck spaces. With evolution of the antimicrobial therapy, the incidence of these infections has come down and odontogenic causes are now the most common source of deep neck space infections. Deaths and complications too have reduced due to timely intervention and availability of newer antimicrobial therapy with broadspectrum coverage.[1] But still, some cases of deep fascial space infections prove challenging, especially in immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from HIV or diabetes where the spread is sometimes very rapid and can cause morbidity and mortality.[2] Treatment in the form of incision and drainage is carried out in most of the patients with the administration of broadspectrum antibiotics.

Prabhu and Nirmalkumar: Acute fascial space infections of neck

Nadiad, Gujarat, India, from January 2001 to December 2017. All the patients were admitted and treated in the same hospital. The acute infections involved the following fascial spaces: peritonsillar space, canine space, buccal space, masseteric space, sublingual space/submandibular space (Ludwig's angina), parapharyngeal space, retropharyngeal space, and pretracheal and prelaryngeal spaces.
There were 654 (63.24%) males and 380 (36.76%) females with age ranging from 21 days to 96 years having the mean age of 31.4 years. Postclinical examination in patients suspected to have deep neck space infection, radiological investigations were done in the form of ultrasonography (USG) or computerized tomography (CT) scan in case where the location and extent were not definite or to differentiate between cellulitis and abscess formation when there was doubt, especially in case of Ludwig's angina. Most of the deep abscesses - retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal abscesses were subject to radiological investigation in the form of a contrast CT scan, while the rest of them were either diagnosed clinically or using USG to confirm the extent, relationship with the neurovascular bundles and to decide the treatment plan. USG was performed on the patients using SAMSUNG RS 80 (South Korea) [Figure 1]. CT was performed on the patients in the supine position using PHILLIPS MX 16 CT SCAN (The Netherlands) [Figure 2]. Odontogenic infection as a cause was found in almost 78.43% of abscesses, foreign body in 0.58% of the cases, and infected tonsil in 10.15% of the cases. In the remaining cases, the abscesses could not be attributed to any particular cause. All the patients were monitored for possible threatening of airway obstruction, septicemia, and antibiotic therapy was started immediately without waiting for the culture and sensitivity. As these infections are of polymicrobial nature, combination therapy of broadspectrum antibiotics is recommended for maximal antibiotic effect. Treatment was given in the form of incision and drainage of the abscesses (83.69%), and systemic antibiotics (100%) in the form of ceftriaxone + sulbactam (300 mg/kg body weight) and lincomycin (12 mg/kg body weight) were given intravenously (IV) 12 hourly for at least 3 days, followed by the same antibiotics given orally at least for 10 days. Spectrum sensitivity report normally takes around 4-5 days in the rural setup that we work in, and so we cannot wait for the same to initiate treatment. However, on retrospectively analyzing the spectrum sensitivity reports of our patients, 95% of our patients were sensitive to both the antibiotics used by us mentioned above, and 99% of the patients were sensitive to at least one of those antibiotics. Only seven cases in our study were resistant to both the antibiotics started by us. The causative organism in these cases was methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus, which was sensitive to linezolid (a synthetic antibiotic of oxazolidinone class) and the same was started in the dose of 20 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. Supportive therapy, such as IV fluids,

analgesics, and mouthwash, was given. Most patients presented with symptoms of pain, fever, dysphagia, and swelling. Some patients, however, also presented with symptoms such as trismus (10.44%), respiratory distress (0.34%), and change in voice (0.19%). Routine blood investigations done in all cases were hemogram, serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, random blood sugar, serum creatinine, serum HIV, and hepatitis B surface antigen. Patients were followed up for at least 3month postoperatively.
Results
Incidence of different fascial space infections of the neck There were 654 male (63.25%) and 380 female (36.75%) in the study involving various spaces. The incidence of various types of space infections in 1034 patients is given in Figure 3.
Of the 1034 patients, 538 (52%) patients had submandibular and sublingual space infection (Ludwig's angina). The second most common space infection was parapharyngeal space infection which affected about 227 (22%) patients. This was then followed by peritonsillar infection affecting 114 (11%) patients. Various other fascial spaces involved were buccal and canine space infection affecting 104 (10%) patients; retropharyngeal space infection affecting 41 (4%) patients and paratracheal, pretracheal, and prelaryngeal space infections affecting 10 (1%) patients.
Average age of presentation The mean age of the patients in this study was 31.4 years. The average age of patients having submandibular or sublingual space infection was 33 years. Similarly, the average age of patients affected by parapharyngeal space infection was 34 years, peritonsillar space infection was 32 years, and buccal and canine space infection was 45 years. The average age of patients affected by retropharyngeal space infection was 43 years, while that of pretracheal, paratracheal, and prelaryngeal space infection was 39 years.
Common complaints Pain was the most common presenting symptom and was found in all the patients in our study. Swelling, fever, trismus, and odynophagia were other common presenting symptoms. Respiratory distress was found in 1 (10%) patient of pre/paratracheal infection, 2 (4.87%) patients of retropharyngeal space infection, and 1 (0.18%) patient of submandibular space infection. Change in voice was only noted in 2 (20%) cases of pre/paratracheal space infection. Detailed format is given in Figure 4.
Etiology In general, 78.43% of all the space infections of the neck had odontogenic origin. In submandibular space infection, odontogenic origin made up to 495 (92%) cases as the etiological cause, followed by sialadenitis in 2 (0.37%) cases. Peritonsillar space infection occurred mostly due to the tonsillar etiology in 85 (74.56%) cases, followed by odontogenic

cause in 14 (12.28%) cases and foreign body involvement in 2 (1.75%) cases. Parapharyngeal space infection occurred mostly due to odontogenic cause in 180 (79.29%) cases, followed by tonsillar infection in 18 (7.92%) cases. Chief etiology for canine + buccal space infection in our study was of the odontogenic origin found in 89 (85.57%) patients. The main etiological factor for retropharyngeal space infection in our study was odontogenic infection, which was seen in 33 (80.48%) cases, followed by foreign body involvement in 2 (4.87%) cases. One such case is given in Figure 5a.

Postoperative photographs are shown in Figure 5b and c. The causative factor for pre/paratracheal + prelaryngeal infection was trauma, foreign body involvement, and thyroiditis in 2 (20%), 2 (20%), and 2 (20%) patients, respectively. In rest of the cases, no particular etiological factor could be attributed.
Comorbid conditions In our study, the most common comorbid condition found was diabetes and HIV. Diabetes was found in 98 (9.47%) patients, while HIV was present in 10 (0.96%) patients.
Treatment given Only 13 (11%) patients of peritonsillar space infection and 102 (19%) patients of submandibular space infection were treated by antibiotics alone. These 115 (11.12%) patients were treated with the combination of ceftriaxone + sulbactam and lincomycin along with supportive therapy as mentioned previously. Rest all the patients were treated by a combined approach of surgery in the form of incision and drainage and injectable broadspectrum antibiotics as mentioned previously.
Other interventions required Other interventions such as foreign body removal were carried out in one patient (0.87%) of peritonsillar space infection and two patients (4.87%) of retropharyngeal space infection. In cases where airway was compromised, tracheostomy was performed. It was performed in 1 (0.18%) patient of submandibular space infection, 1 (1%) patient of pre/paratracheal space infection, and 2 (4.87%) patients of retropharyngeal space infection. The overall mortality rate was 0.1%. Revision surgery (incision and drainage) was required in 12 (1.16%) patients. All the patients had odontogenic infection as an etiological cause and had not undergone treatment for same post the first surgery.
Average length of stay in the hospital Patients with deeper infections such as retropharyngeal and pre/paratracheal and prelaryngeal fascial infections on an average take 7.5 and 8.4 days of hospital admission, respectively, which tells about the severity of the infection. Patients having parapharyngeal and submandibular space infection have an average hospital stay of 3.4 and 3.6 days, respectively, while that of peritonsillar and buccal/canine space infection have an average stay of 1.2 and 2.2 days, respectively.
Thus, deeper fascial neck infections such as retropharyngeal, pretracheal, paratracheal, and prelaryngeal space infections have a higher hospital stay requiring continuous inhospital patient administration due to the increased severity of the infection. Patients with submandibular and parapharyngeal space infection have a lesser stay in the hospital as compared to the patients having retropharyngeal and pretracheal space infection explaining the better management and lesser comparative morbidity.
Complications We had one mortality in the entire series (0.1%), and it was a patient of retropharyngeal abscess and the cause of death was

mediastinitis. Revision surgery was required in 12 (1.16%) patients and most of these patients (0.58%) were of canine/ buccal space infection as postprimary drainage of the abscess, they did not undergo treatment for their odontogenic infection. Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy was noted in 1 (0.1%) patient who was having paratracheal abscess.
Discussion
Submandibular space/sublingual space infection (Ludwig's angina) was the most commonly affected space in our study, followed by the parapharyngeal and peritonsillar space infection. In 52% of our patients, submandibular space/sublingual space was affected, while 22% of the patients had parapharyngeal space infection and in 11% of patients, the peritonsillar space infection was present. Probably, as odontogenic infection was the most common contributing factor (78.43%) for the fascial space infections in our study, the submandibular and sublingual spaces which are the ones in most proximity to the mandibular teeth were affected. For all the cases of space infection involving various spaces, broadspectrum empirical antibiotic therapy should be started as soon as possible in all the patients, as early aggressive management prevents lifethreatening complications such as descending mediastinitis, septic shock, upper airway obstruction, jugular vein thrombosis, cavernous septic embolus, carotid artery rupture, aorticopulmonary fistula, acute renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.[3,4] Many other space infection then get involved after the spread from submandibular space. Our findings were similar to many other studies found in the literature where too the submandibular/sublingual space was most commonly affected.[5,6]
The organisms most commonly isolated in our study were the ones which are usually found in the oral cavity and oropharynx. Mixed organisms having aerobic and anaerobic activity were found. Data for only 796 patients (76.98%) are available having positives cultures. The negative cultures may be due to the prior antibiotic therapy which would make it sterile. The number of culture reports which showed no organisms was 238 (23.02%). Various organisms had been isolated from the patients with the space infections. The culture was positive for 205 cases of Streptococcus viridans sp. (19.82%) and 193 cases of S. aureus (18.66%) which was also similar to those found in other studies.[1,710] Rest of the details are given in Table 1.
In our study, there were 98 (9.48%) diabetic patients and 10 (0.96%) HIV patients; 29 patients among them were having the blood glucose under control by diet and exercise, and 51 patients were on oral medication for the same while the rest 18 patients were made stable using insulin. Ten patients (0.96%) were HIV affected for which antiretroviral therapy was started. The blood glucose control was done in the diabetic patients along with the initiation of the treatment. In the studies by Huang et al.[11] and Gujrathi et al.,[10] again diabetes was found to be the most common comorbid

condition. Comparison of various studies and the present study is given in Figure 6.
The three important keys to successful management of any deep neck infections are: (1) protection and control of airway, (2) antibiotic therapy, and (3) surgical drainage.
As per Levitt's thinking, "antibiotics are not a substitute for surgery, they should be used in conjunction with proper surgical drainage."[12] The empirical therapy to be started should focus on those organisms which are isolated commonly in the oral cavity such as Streptococcus species and S. aureus. Improvement on Gramnegative coverage should be taken into consideration in debilitated or immunocompromised patients. The duration of antibiotic culture should be decided on the patient's general condition such as healthy granulation, presence of slough, induration, decreasing of signs, and symptoms.
About 83.69% of the patients underwent surgical intervention along with antibiotic support, while in 11.12% of cases, only antibiotic administration sufficed which is almost the same as compared to the study by Sethi and Stanley.[13] Deep neck infection still at a cellulitis stage can be treated by antibiotics itself.[3] Surgical drainage should be established when the cellulitis stage is transformed in the abscess stage. However, in the absence of abscess stage, incision, and drainage is performed in those who deteriorate clinically or fail to improve after 2 days of initiation of the antibiotic therapy.[14]
Management of airway is most essential and challenging in treating patients with deep neck infections.[10] HarEl et al.[15] reported that the need for tracheotomy was common in retropharyngeal and submandibular abscesses. Whenever a patient of deep neck space infection presents with difficulty in breathing, tracheostomy becomes the gold standard and the first line of treatment to secure the airway and save the life of the patient.[16] Intubation is not preferred because of the extensive edema in the laryngopharynx and the risk of the abscess opening internally leading to aspiration when intubation is attempted. In our study also, tracheostomy was required in 0.38% cases of deep neck infections which is not consistent with the study by Kataria et al.[14] and Eftekharian et al.[17]

In our study, we treated 13 patients (11%) of peritonsillar space infection and 102 patients (19%) of submandibular space infection using antibiotics only. Significant number of these infections was not frank abscess but was cellulitis which may respond conservatively to the broadspectrum antibiotic therapy only without the need of surgical intervention. Thus, 115 patients (11.12%) in our study were treated only using antibiotics. Surgical intervention was done in 83.69% of cases in our study, which was consistent with the studies by Mumtaz et al.,[18] Eftekharian et al.,[17] and HarEl et al.[15] with surgical intervention required in approximately 78%, 79%, and 90% of the cases, respectively.
The odontogenic infection was found to be the most common cause (78.43% of cases) in our present study for deep neck infections which is consistent with the study by Tschiassny[19] which had 70% of cases. Thus, treatment is not complete unless the etiological cause for the infection is removed. If incision and drainage is done without removing the cause, recurrence of the infection develops and a second surgery is required. In our study, 12 patients (1.16%) required revision surgery in the form of incision and drainage again along with the removal of the odontogenic cause.
Conclusion
According to our study, it could be concluded that the most common infection among the deep neck infections is the submandibular/sublingual space infection seen in 538 (52%) cases. The most common cause for the deep neck infections was odontogenic infection found in 811 cases making up to 78.43% of the total population.
If the etiologic cause is not removed primarily, high chances are present for the infection to recur. In our study, out of 44 cases wherein the etiologic cause (odontogenic) was not treated, 12 (27.27%) cases developed recurrence and revision surgery (incision and drainage) was required. The most common organisms isolated from the sites of infection were S. viridans sp. found in 205 (19.82%) cases and S. aureus found in 193 (18.66%) cases. The most common comorbid conditions were found to be diabetes, which was found in 98 (9.47%) cases and HIV which was found in 10 (0.96%) patients.
Retropharyngeal space infection is considered to be the most dreaded condition with high morbidity and mortality rates due to the space extending to the superior mediastinum, thus being a greater risk to the airway as well as complications such as mediastinitis. The only mortality that occurred in our study was of the patient having retropharyngeal space infection. Tracheostomy was required in two patients of the 41 patients (4.87%) of retropharyngeal infection indicating that of all the fascial spaces affected, it is associated with maximum morbidity and mortality.

ABSTRACT: Nanosized samples of the cubic thiospinel FeCr2S4 were synthesized by ball milling of FeS and Cr2S3 precursors followed by a distinct temperature treatment between 500 and 800 °C. Depending on the applied temperature, volume weighted mean (Lvol) particle sizes of 56 nm (500 °C), 86 nm (600 °C), and 123 nm (800 °C) were obtained. All samples show a transition into the ferrimagnetic state at a Curie temperature TC of  167 K only slightly depending on the annealing temperature. Above TC, ferromagnetic spin clusters survive and Curie-Weiss behavior is observed only at T  TC, with T depending on the heat treatments and the external magnetic field applied. Zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetic susceptibilities diverge significantly below TC in contrast to what is observed for conventionally solid-state-prepared polycrystalline
samples. In the low-temperature region, all samples show a transition into the orbital
ordered state at about 9 K, which is more pronounced for the samples heated to higher
temperatures. This observation is a clear indication that the cation disorder is very low
because a pronounced disorder would suppress this magnetic transition. The unusual magnetic properties of the samples at low temperatures and different external magnetic fields can be clearly related to different factors like structural microstrain and
magnetocrystalline anisotropy.

 INTRODUCTION
Binary and ternary chromium chalcogenides exhibit a large
variety of chemical and physical properties explaining the
intense research of these materials. Examples for the diversity of properties are a large linear negative thermal expansion,1 the tuneable thermoelectric properties,2-5 a large magnetocaloric effect,6 the photocatalytic properties in dye degradation,7 the tuning of magnetic properties by Li intercalation,8 ferrimagnetic properties in nanosheets,9 the application as stable electrode material in sodium-ion batteries,10 or the generation of nanoscale networks.11 One of the most intensely
investigated ternary chromium chalcogenides is the iron
chromium thiospinel FeCr2S4, which crystallizes in the normal cubic spinel structure with the general formula AB2X4 (space group: Fd3m, no. 227). The S2- anions are arranged in a close-
packed face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice, creating tetrahedral
(A) and octahedral (B) voids, which are partially occupied by the Fe and Cr cations. The Fe2+ cations occupy 1/8 of the tetrahedral voids and the Cr3+ cation 1/2 of the octahedral positions. The d-orbitals of the Fe2+ cations are split into an energetically lower e doublet and an upper t2 triplet. The 3d6 electrons are distributed over the orbitals according to Hund's rule, yielding a high-spin configuration with S = 2, and these cations are Jahn-Teller active. The 3d3 electrons of the Cr3+
cations occupy the t2g level with S = 3/2. The magnetic and especially the magnetoelectric properties of FeCr2S4 attracted particular attention.12-14 Three main exchange couplings affect

the magnetic behavior of FeCr2S4: nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic B-B (Cr-Cr) interactions, the more distant neighbor antiferromagnetic B-B interactions, and the 120° A-B
superexchange interaction that is antiferromagnetic. By neutron powder diffraction, FeCr2S4 has been shown to order ferrimagnetically below 180 K with Fe and Cr moments aligned collinear antiparallel.15 Already early on
unusual physical properties like a complex behavior of the Hall resistivity,16 anisotropic resistivity and magnetoresistance effects due to spin disorder were reported.17 Mossbauer
spectroscopic investigations on polycrystalline FeCr2S4 demonstrated an unusual behavior of the electric field gradient at the Fe2+ site at about 10 K.18,19 Further, low-temperature Mossbauer spectroscopy studies indicated a static cooperative Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion (c/a < 1) on the tetrahedral site, stabilizing the 5Eg ground state of the Fe2+ cations.20-22 Heat capacity measurements at low temperatures exhibited a -like
anomaly around this temperature but the particular shape of this anomaly depends on the stoichiometry of the sample.23,24

Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) behavior was observed with a magnitude comparable to that found in manganites.25
However, adverse to the manganites, the CMR is not caused by double exchange or a JT distortion.26,27 It was proposed
that by increasing the temperature, long-range magnetic order
gradually breaks down by approaching TC accompanied by the formation of nanosized spin clusters, which survive well above TC. In an external magnetic field above TC, the rapidly fluctuating spin clusters coalesce and generate bulk-like
ferromagnetism, which leads to the lowering of electrical
resistivity. Evidence for superexchange interactions between Fe2+ and Cr3+ cations in FeCr2S4 was obtained using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) investigations.28
Below the Curie temperature TC, which varies between 17729 and 167 K,30-32 several unusual features were observed
in the temperature-dependent magnetization curves: A cusplike anomaly occurs at Tm  60 K as well as a splitting of the zfc-fc susceptibility data below this temperature.30,33-35 The divergence of the zfc-fc susceptibilities resembles a glassy
behavior, which is exceptional for a stoichiometric and ordered
system. Spin-glass-like states were also postulated to exist below 60 K due to fluctuating competing exchange interactions
in conjunction with high magnetocrystalline anisotropy for the Fe2+ moments at the tetrahedral site being strongly antiferromagnetically coupled with Cr3+ cations.33 This
unusual magnetic behavior was attributed to changes in the domain structure30 and the appearance of noncubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy.36 The latter was proposed to be the
result of the structure transformation, generating pinning
centers for magnetic domain walls. But neutron scattering
investigations demonstrated that the magnetic structure is of simple Nee l type well down to 4 K with (Cr) = 2.9 B and (Fe) = 4.2 B, giving a total magnetic moment  = 1.6 B (TC = 180 K).37 In other neutron diffraction studies, the values 1.92 B/fu (fu = formula unit)38 and 1.59 B/fu were determined.12 A broadening of Bragg reflections in X-ray powder diffraction patterns below TC was attributed to inhomogeneous lattice distortions.39 Low-temperature high-
resolution transmission electron microscopy on oriented single
crystals of FeCr2S4 showed a cubic to triclinic structural phase transition within crystallographic domains and an overall symmetry reduction from Fd3m to F43m.40 The proposed structural transformation at Tm  60 K could be revealed with ultrasonic measurements on single crystals.41 An anomaly in the magnetization versus field curve was observed for 0H = 5.5 T, which was attributed to the development of a new
magnetic phase, most probably from the incommensurate noncollinear spin structure42 to the commensurate collinear spin structure.43 Spin reorientation at 60 K was also reported from ultrasound studies on dense polycrystalline samples.44 ac
magnetic susceptibility measurements performed on oriented
single crystals showed a pronounced frequency dependence
between 90 and 20 K for both the real and imaginary parts of the ac susceptibility. The observations made for the field and
temperature dependence were explained by domain wall
pinning. Below 60 K, changes in the domain structure and
appearance of pinning centers caused by structural changes
were suggested to lead to spin-glass-like magnetic anomalies below 60 K.30
A second anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility data was
observed at around 9 K and attributed to orbital ordering.18,19,38,45-47 It was argued that this anomaly occurs due to a unit cell volume contraction and that a cooperative JT effect

and spin-orbit coupling of the Fe2+ ion compete, leading to
spin reorientation at about 60 K, which gives rise to the onset of short-range orbital ordering at this temperature.48 It is noteworthy that the anomaly at T  9 K can be suppressed in polycrystalline specimens by applying large magnetic fields.49
For single crystals, experimental evidence was presented that an orbital glass phase is formed at TOO  9 K.32,33,35,42,43,47 The Curie temperature and the anomaly at 9 K are only weakly shifted at high external fields up to 9 T. At lower magnetic fields, the magnetic moments of Fe2+ and Cr3+ are lower than the spin-only values, and only for 0Hext = 5.5 T, the expected spin-only values are reached. The dielectric permeability shows
a linear correlation with the magnetization of the sample,
which is consistent with the existence of ferroelectric polarization and a multiferroic ground state below 10 K.12,13 The critical exponents, , , and , for the paramagnetic to ferrimagnetic phase transition were determined using different approaches.  and  are found close to the mean field theory values, whereas  is higher than expected, which has been
attributed to incomplete ferrimagnetic transition and the presence of short-range ordering above TC.31
A perpetual problem with FeCr2S4 samples, crystals and polycrystalline material, is that often the physical properties
depend essentially on the detailed synthesis conditions, causing
hardly controllable minute compositional mismatch and/or
positional disorder of the cations. Consequently, samples
synthesized by conventional high-temperature techniques often showed differences in the magnetization and zfc-fc curves compared to, e.g., a material obtained by the field-
activated sintering technique (FAST). However, for the FAST sample, the magnetic anomaly at TOO  9 K was found absent and the anomaly normally occurring at Tm  60 K is shifted to a lower temperature. In addition, the transition from
paramagnetic to the ferrimagnetic state is less sharp for the
FAST sample. All observations have been attributed to residual structural disorder in the samples prepared with FAST.50 To
summarize, the magnetic characteristics of single-crystalline
and polycrystalline FeCr2S4 samples are as follows: (i) a transition from paramagnetic to the ferrimagnetic state occurs at TC  170 K; (ii) below the Curie temperature, structural changes or lattice distortions as well as spin reorientation set
in, leading to magnetic anomalies at about 60 K; and (iii) orbital ordering is observed at TOO  9 K.
In the past, all investigations were performed on well-
crystallized polycrystalline samples of FeCr2S4 or on single crystals, which were prepared by chemical vapor deposition.
The only exception is the study of FAST samples reported in ref 50, which showed a different magnetic behavior compared
to single crystals or microcrystalline samples. A systematic
study of the changes of the magnetic behavior as a function of
sizes of coherently scattering domains was not performed until
now on FeCr2S4. For the preparation of nanoparticles, several synthetic approaches were well established. Very often solvent-
mediated methods are applied, which have the disadvantage
that the surfaces of the crystallites are covered by capping
molecules. To avoid such impurities, mechanochemistry is a
promising approach. While this synthetic approach is applied
in many areas of inorganic and organic chemistry, it has rarely been utilized for the preparation of ternary sulfides. Hence, we decided using the mechanochemical technique for the first
time for the generation of nanosized FeCr2S4 materials. The main aim of the present study is to get better insights into the
variation of the magnetic properties in the nanoregime and

therefore we intentionally synthesized nanosized FeCr2S4 polycrystalline samples with particle size distributions ranging between 10 and 50 nm by reacting ball-milled mixtures of FeS and Cr2S3 at temperatures between 500 and 800 °C. With increasing annealing temperature, we find a continuous increase of the particle size, a moderate increase of saturation magnetic moment, and a variation of magnetocrystalline anisotropy. We attribute these observations to the variation of the defect structure with the annealing temperature
modifying the approach to magnetic saturation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Particle Size. The XRPD patterns of the three samples and the results of the Rietveld refinements assuming the space group Fd3m (no. 227) (Fe: 8a; Cr: 16d; S: 32e, 0.383) are displayed in Figure 1. All samples are phase pure and the cubic lattice parameters were refined to 9.9832(1) Å (500 °C), 9.9922(1) Å (600 °C), and 9.9923(1) Å (800 °C). The cubic lattice parameter a of the 500 °C sample is significantly smaller than values reported in the literature. There data scattering in a very narrow band around 10 Å13,50-55 can be found, while in ref 33, the authors obtained a = 9.983 Å for one sample, mentioning that the lattice parameter depends on the stoichiometry, but unfortunately the exact composition was not reported. Even for a sample with crystallite sizes between 40 and 45 nm, a was determined to 10.008(1) Å.50 We note that the cubic lattice parameter a is significantly reduced at low temperatures, from 9.9894(3) Å at 180 K to 9.9808(3) Å at 5 K.48 In a further study, a decrease from 9.9813(3) Å (175 K) to 9.9756(3) Å (10 K) was reported.38
Increasing the annealing temperature of our samples has two effects revealed by the XRPD patterns:
1. The broad bulge below 30° in 2 decreases significantly in intensity and almost vanishes for the 800 °C sample, which is assigned to a reduction of incoherently scattering defects.
2. As demonstrated for the 311 Bragg reflections (the right side of Figure 1), increasing the annealing temperature leads to a linewidth reduction, indicating an increase in the sizes of coherently scattering domains.
This effect is also clearly seen in the parameters of fitted lognormal distribution of the coherently scattering domains (Figure 2). The mean particle size value  and the variance

°C) to 1.8 × 10-4 (600 °C) to finally reach 9 × 10-5 for the samples annealed at 800 °C. The smaller value for the lattice parameter of the sample prepared at 500 °C may be caused by
the larger number of nanocrystallites compared to the
materials heated at higher temperatures. In the literature,
mainly a lattice expansion was reported for oxides even for particles larger than 100 nm,56 while a lattice contraction was observed for metallic nanoparticles.57 However, there are also
observations that the lattice contracts with decreasing particle size, e.g., for -Fe2O3.58 This phenomenon was explained by an increased covalency of the Fe-O bond on the nanoscale. Because the Cr-S and Fe-S bonds are much more covalent
than in oxides, we assume that the unit cell contraction is
based on a similar phenomenon. Magnetic Properties. Figure 4 displays the inverse
magnetic susceptibilities collected at 1, 2, and 4 T. At sufficiently high temperatures and significantly above the Curie

temperature, the inverse susceptibilities converge to Curie-
Weiss behavior with the same slope for all three samples similar to that observed by Gibart et al.29 On approaching the
ferrimagnetic Curie temperature, the susceptibilities become field-dependent with the largest field splitting seen for the 800 °C sample. We attribute this splitting to ferrimagnetic spin clusters, which can be saturated with increasing field, leading to
an increase of the inverse susceptibilities with larger measuring fields.
For all samples, a transition to the ferrimagnetic state is determined at TC  167 K, in agreement with the literature where values between 17729 and 167 K were reported.30-32 Bifurcation of the zfc-fc data occurs at 120, 110, and 100 K (Figure 5) for the samples prepared at 500, 600, and 800 °C,

respectively. Below the bifurcation, the zfc curves continuously decrease and settle into a plateau below 25 K. A clear steplike drop of the magnetic susceptibility occurs at 9 K for the 800 and 600 °C samples, which is caused by the long-range
orbital ordering as discussed in the literature. This anomaly is less well developed for the sample prepared at 500 °C. The
decrease of the zfc susceptibility with decreasing temperature can be attributed to microscopic modifications in the longrange ordered magnetic structure and/or different magneto-
crystalline anisotropy due to varying amounts of structural defects, affecting the temperature dependence of the domain dynamics. Notable is the different behavior of the samples. Whereas for the 800 °C sample, "melting" of the domain
structure on approaching from low temperatures starts at about 50 K, a sizeable increase of the zfc susceptibility of the 500 °C sample begins only at about 75 K, indicating more effective
domain pinning. Below the bifurcation and before settling into
saturation, the fc susceptibilities pass through shallow maxima, most pronounced for the 800 °C sample.
Figure 6 displays magnetization curves collected at 4 K in external fields up to 9 T. The saturated moment increases with the preparation temperature from 1.76 B, 1.80 B, to 1.83 B at 9 T for the 500, 600, and 800 °C samples, respectively. For
the collinear ferrimagnetic structure, a saturated magnetic moment of 1.6 B was reported from high-magnetic-field experiments.43 DFT-based calculations predicted saturation values of 2.0 B59 and 1.92 B.60 For polycrystalline compounds, the data reported in the literature are, e.g., 1.55 B given in ref 60 or 1.6 B reported in refs 12, 37.

samples investigated here, the values are noticeably larger but
do not fully reach the theoretically predicted values. The
increase of the magnetic moment with the annealing
temperature may be explained by reduced surface spin canting,
a smaller magnetic dead-layer and/or a reduced number of
defects on the Cr and Fe sublattices. One may speculate that
the larger values obtained here are caused by an imperfect
collinear magnetic structure, which may be due to microstrain that is significantly reduced with increasing annealing temper-
ature (see above). We note that the saturation value of the sample annealed at 800 °C matches that measured on a single crystal for the <111> direction (1.84 B), which is the hard magnetic axis.33
Also apparent from the magnetization curves is the difference in the behavior at small fields where domain wall
motions are the prevailing process of magnetization. For the 800 °C sample, magnetization grows rapidly, whereas for the 500 °C sample, after a pedestal at low fields, the magnetization
increases with about the same slope as for the other samples. The magnetization behavior reflecting domain wall motion at low fields correlates with the magnitude of the microstrain derived from the XRPD measurements. The different magnetization versus field behavior at low temperatures can be
attributed to varying crystalline anisotropy energies for the different samples.
The work W(M) done when magnetizing to a certain field 0H is given by the area between the M-H curve and the magnetization axis. It can be obtained by integration according to61

For cubic crystals, the anisotropy energy is usually described by the three anisotropy coefficients Ki (i = 0, 1, 2), which weighs the products of even powers of the directional cosines measured with respect to the distinguished magnetization axes system. For a polycrystalline sample with a random orientation of the crystallites with respect to the external field, the anisotropy work W can only be taken as a qualitative measure of the anisotropy energy. Integration of the area of the 4 K magnetization curves, as indicated by the shaded areas in Figure 7, indicates that the anisotropy energy (see the inset of Figure 7) decreases with increasing preparation temperature by

The inset displays the integral  0Msat0H(M) dM (black dots) corresponding to the color shaded areas in the main frame and the microstrain (red dots, see the text above) as a function of preparation temperatures of the three samples prepared at the temperatures, as indicated. The dashed and dotted lines in the inset are guides to the eye.

about 15%, paralleling the decrease of the microstrain for
higher preparation temperatures. In addition, higher prepara-
tion temperatures appear to reduce imperfections in the
samples and the crystal anisotropy. The magnetization of the samples was recorded at different
temperatures up to T = 175 K somewhat higher than TC (Figure 8). As expected, the magnetic moment obtained at the highest magnetic field decreases with increasing temperature.
But even at 175 K, the magnetization is not linear as expected for a paramagnetic material, and a magnetic moment of 0.75 B is observed for all samples, which is again an indication for the presence of spin clusters, which survived at T > TC.
At sufficiently high fields (see Figure 8) in the regime where magnetization processes by domain rotation (0H  2 T) prevail, it has been found that the field dependence of the
magnetization provides information about the type of defects in the sample ("law of approach").61-65 Generally, the
approach to saturation is expanded in a polynomial of powers of the inverse magnetic field according to

M(H) = Msat (1 - a1/(0H) - a2/(0H)2 - ···)

+ a0 0H

(2)

The coefficient a1 is interpreted to describe inclusions and/ or microstress and a2 is due to crystal anisotropy. At temperatures well below the Curie temperature, the term a00H, which represents the field-induced increase in the spontaneous magnetization of the domains or forced magnet-
ization, is usually very small and neglected. A plot of the
magnetization of the three FeCr2S4 samples as a function of inverse external field (Figure 8), 1/0H, shows that the magnetizations at 4 K for very high fields follow very well straight lines with no significant slope change. Considering the field range from 0.5 to 9 T and fitting the experimental data to eq 2 reveals that the deviations toward lower fields can be favorably taken care of by additionally considering the term  1/(0H)2, as displayed in Figure 9.

prepared at 800 °C could possibly attribute to an increase of sulfur defects with increasing preparation temperature.
Next, we discuss the coercive fields (the inset of Figure 11) derived from the low-field hysteresis curves displayed in Figure

Depending on the preparation temperature, the coefficients a1 and a2 exhibit different behaviors (see the inset of Figure 10). Whereas a1 is almost constant or moderately increasing toward 800 °C, a2 drops by a factor of 4 for the specimen prepared at 800 °C, indicating that crystal anisotropy decreases with the preparation temperature. This finding is in line with the results of the analysis of the anisotropy work experiment. The observation that a1 is mildly growing for the sample

11. The coercive fields range between 200 and 350 Oe. However, they show a nonuniform behavior with the annealing temperature and after an initial drop from 500 to 600 °C, the coercive field increases again for the sample prepared at 800 °C. This parallels the behavior of the parameter a1 of the lawof-approach fits (see the inset of Figure 10), indicating that the coercive field is primarily determined by inclusions, some disorder and/or microstrain, and less by anisotropy.
The dynamics of domain wall motion was studied by frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility experiments. Figure 12 displays the real part of the ac susceptibilities measured at 1 kHz as a function of temperature between 50 and 200 K. As for the dc susceptibilities, there is no indication of unusual behavior at or around 60 K. With increasing preparation temperature, the ac susceptibilities increase. On approaching TC, indicated by a peak and a steep decrease above, the susceptibilities exhibit a bulge, which we ascribed to dissipation due to domain reorientation dynamics, similarly seen in the imaginary part of the ac susceptibilities (inset b of the Figure 13).

The arrows mark the positions of the minima, revealing a continuous downshift of TC with increasing preparation temperature. (b) Imaginary part of the ac susceptibility of the 500 °C sample measured with frequencies of 1, 5, and 10 kHz, as indicated.
The bulge shifts nonlinearly with the preparation temperature as is well seen in the temperature derivative of the real part of the ac susceptibilities (Figure 13a). The maximum of the bulge is at the lowest temperature for the sample prepared at 600 °C, correlating with the behavior of the coercive fields (see the inset of Figure 11). The ferrimagnetic transition sharpens continuously with increasing preparation temperature. For identifying the minimum of the derivative d/dT with TC, the derivatives also reveal that by increasing the preparation temperature a steady, however minute downshift of TC from 168.6(5) to 167.8(5) and 167.1(3) K takes place for sample preparation temperatures of 500, 600, and 800 °C,
respectively. CONCLUSIONS FeCr2S4 samples synthesized by mechanochemistry methods followed by subsequent heat treatment led to nanocrystalline products exhibiting different domain size distributions. Increasing the preparation temperature generates larger coherently scattering domains and lower microstrain. dc and ac magnetic susceptibility investigations evidence a phase transition from paramagnetic to the ferrimagnetic state at a Curie temperature TC of  167 K, slightly dependent on the preparation temperature. Above TC, the magnetic susceptibility

data significantly deviate from Curie-Weiss behavior, and only
at temperatures high enough, the linear behavior of the inverse
magnetization data is observed. This unusual observation is
ascribed to the survival of easily polarizable spin clusters well above TC. The zfc-fc curves show a bifurcation at distinct T < TC, with T depending on the preparation temperatures of the samples. Below this bifurcation, the zfc data exhibit a sharp drop and reveal a magnetic anomaly at T  9 K, which is
related to the transition into the orbital ordered state. This transition is well pronounced for the 600 and 800 °C samples and less clearly visible for the 500 °C sample. It appears that
the transition into the orbital ordered state is a local
phenomenon and does not markedly depend on the size of
coherently scattering domains. The analysis of the magnet-
ization behavior of the samples at low temperatures as a function of magnetic field clearly reveals a relation between microstrain and different crystalline anisotropy energies. Such a relation also holds for the coercive fields. Domain dynamics
and associated anomalies in the real parts of the ac
susceptibilities are consistent with these findings. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
The samples were prepared by mechanochemical milling in a
high energy planetary mill (Pulverisette 7, Fritsch, Idar-
Oberstein, Germany). Stoichiometric amounts of the corresponding binary sulfides, FeS and Cr2S3, were filled in a zirconia grinding beaker furnished with six zirconia spheres
with a diameter of 15 mm and milled at a rotational speed of
350 rpm for 6 h. To increase the crystallinity, the powders
were subsequently annealed for 2 h in a tube furnace under flowing H2S gas at temperatures of 500, 600, and 800 °C. FeS and Cr2S3 were prepared by a solid-state reaction from the elements, Fe, S, and Cr, respectively, in evacuated (10-4 mbar) and sealed silica ampoules. Due to the significant vapor pressure of sulfur, the sealed ampoules were first slowly heated up to 400 °C in 960 min and held at this temperature for 1440 min. The temperature then was increased to the final temperature of 1000 °C in 2880 min and held for 4320 min.
After the reaction was complete, the ampoules were slowly
cooled down to room temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRPD) experiments were performed on a
PANalytical Empyrean (Cu K1,2), equipped with a PIXcel 1D detector using 0.1 mm outer diameter glass capillaries (Hilgenberg GmbH). Rietveld refinements were performed using TOPAS Academic software version 6.0.66,67 To account for instrumental broadening, the profile function and axial
divergence were determined using a LaB6 standard sample (NIST 660c) measured under the same conditions. The mean
domain size distribution was obtained by whole powder
pattern modeling (WPPM) assuming a log-normal distribution g(D) for the domain size according to68,69

where D is the domain size and  and  are the mean and
variance, respectively.
In addition, the volume weighted average domain size (Lvol) and an upper-limit strain (0 from the strain) were determined.70,71
Magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed by
the extraction method in PPMS-9T system in a temperature range from 2 to 300 K and in magnetic fields up to 9 T.

When we were reading our published article, we found an inconspicuous little data error. The reason for the error is that when we d matlab to simulate the IEC three-ratio method, the numerical input in the code was wrong, resulting in inaccurate experimental data of the IEC three-ratio method. The IEC three-ratio method was the only traditional method introduced in this paper, which was used to compare and highlight the novel artificial intelligence fault diagnosis method proposed in this paper, so this error does not affect the conclusion of the full text. We rewrote the matlab code for the IEC three-ratio method and obtained new experimental results for the IEC three-ratio method under the exact same experimental conditions (including the same computer, the same version of matlab, and the same fault diagnosis data set, etc.). The new experimental data of the IEC three-ratio method have no influence on the previous conclusions. We apologize for our oversight.
The following are the updated experimental data for the IEC three-ratio method (abbreviated as IEC in the table) in Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9.

Calmodulin-dependent nuclear import of HMG-box family nuclear factors: importance of the role of SRY in sex reversal

The HMG (high-mobility group)-box-containing chromatinremodelling factor SRY (sex-determining region on the Y chromosome) plays a key role in sex determination. Its role in the nucleus is critically dependent on two NLSs (nuclear localization signals) that flank its HMG domain: the C-terminally located `NLS' that mediates nuclear transport through Imp1 (importin 1) and the N-terminally located `CaM-NLS' which is known to recognize the calcium-binding protein CaM (calmodulin). In the present study, we examined a number of missense mutations in the SRY CaM-NLS from human XY sex-reversed females for the first time, showing that they result in significantly reduced nuclear localization of GFP (green fluorescent protein)-SRY fusion proteins in transfected cells compared with wild-type. The CaM antagonist CDZ (calmidazolium chloride) was found to significantly reduce wild-type SRY nuclear accumulation, indicating dependence of SRY nuclear import on CaM. Intriguingly,

the CaM-NLS mutants were all resistant to CDZ's effects, implying a loss of interaction with CaM, which was confirmed by direct binding experiments. CaM-binding/resultant nuclear accumulation was the only property of SRY found to be impaired by two of the CaM-NLS mutations, implying that inhibition of CaM-dependent nuclear import is the basis of sex reversal in these cases. Importantly, the CaM-NLS is conserved in other HMG-box-domain-containing proteins such as SOX-2, -9, -10 and HMGN1, all of which were found for the first time to rely on CaM for optimal nuclear localization. CaM-dependent nuclear translocation is thus a common mechanism for this family of important transcription factors.
Key words: calmodulin, high-mobility group box (HMG box), nuclear transport, sex-determining region on the Y chromosome (SRY), SRY-related HMG box (SOX), XY sex reversal.

INTRODUCTION
HMG (high-mobility group) non-histone chromosomal proteins include the AT-hook, HMGN and HMG domain families [1]. Members of the SOX [SRY (sex-determining region on the Y chromosome)-related HMG-box] family of chromatinremodelling factors play important developmental roles, SRY itself playing a key role in mammalian sex determination, as indicated by the fact that 15 % of all XY sex-reversed individuals carry mutations in SRY [2- 4]. Expressed in the indifferent gonad 7 weeks post-fertilization in humans, SRY's specific role is in the nucleus, activating/co-ordinating the expression of genes such as the related protein SOX9 that result in the differentiation of the pre-Sertoli cells to produce a testis, and suppress genes favouring formation of the female gonad [3-6]. In the case of XY sex reversal due to impaired action of SRY (Swyer syndrome), patients present with CGD (complete gonadal dysgenesis), female external genitalia, and one in two develop gonadal tumours [2-4,7].
Like other HMG proteins, SRY is able to bind and bend specific DNA targets through its HMG-box domain [3,8]. The majority of sex-reversing mutations in SRY result in impaired DNA binding/bending, but a number, several of which do not affect DNA binding, map to one of SRY's two independently functioning NLSs (nuclear localization signals) that flank the HMG-box domain (Figure 1) [3,4,7,9-11]. Little is known regarding the mechanism by which the N-terminal `CaM-NLS' (amino acids

59-77) functions, apart from the fact that it can bind the Ca2+-binding protein CaM (calmodulin) in vitro [12], whereas the C-terminal `-NLS' (amino acids 128-134) appears to be conventional, mediating nuclear import dependent on the Imp1 (importin 1) member of the Imp superfamily and the guaninenucleotide-binding protein Ran [13].
We previously described a sex-reversing NLS mutation R133W in the -NLS that impairs Imp1 binding and SRY nuclear localization specifically [10], the results indicating that nuclear import mediated by the -NLS/Imp1 is essential for sex determination. We also found that two sex-reversing mutations in the CaM-recognized CaM-NLS did not affect Imp1 binding [10], implying effects on nuclear import distinct from those involving Imp1. CaM is a ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein, highly conserved in eukaryotes [14,15], which regulates a plethora of Ca2+-responsive cellular processes. A role for CaM in nuclear
import is implied by the fact that the potent CaM antagonist CDZ
(calmidazolium chloride) reduces nuclear accumulation of SOX9
[16,17], whereas a CaM-dependent, Ran-independent nuclear
import pathway has been described for the yeast HMG-box protein
Nhp6Ap [18].
In the present study, we analysed a number of sex-reversing mutations from patients in terms of their CaM/Imp1-binding and nuclear transport properties for the first time. We found that
CDZ can inhibit SRY nuclear transport and, importantly,
that sex-reversing CaM-NLS mutations result in loss of sensitivity
to CDZ. Of several CaM-NLS mutants examined for the first

(A) The SRY protein is shown diagrammatically, with the CaM-NLS and -NLSs flanking the HMG-box (single-letter amino acid code) highlighted together with the sex-reversing point mutations analysed in the present study (see the Materials and methods section for patient details). (B) TM4 cells were transiently transfected to express the indicated GFP-SRY-HMG/FL fusion proteins, and imaged live 24 h later by CLSM using a 40× water-immersion objective. (C) Results of quantitative analysis, whereby CLSM images such as those in (B) were analysed using ImageJ software for the extent of nuclear accumulation measured as the Fn/c (see the Materials and methods section). Results are means +- S.E.M. (n >7); ***P < 0.0001; **P < 0.005; *P < 0.01 for Fn/c values for the NLS mutant constructs significantly different from those of WT.

time, we show that all have reduced nuclear import, and that several are impaired directly in CaM binding. Of these, the M64T and R76P CaM-NLS mutants, which possess normal DNAbinding/bending activity [3,10], have normal Imp1 binding, implying that impaired nuclear import through reduced ability to bind CaM is the basis of sex reversal. Importantly, we also show for the first time that other HMG-box domain proteins, along with a non-histone chromosomal protein, HMGN1, show similar properties to SRY in terms of a CaM-facilitated nuclear import pathway, implying a general role for CaM in the nuclear transport of HMG proteins.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SRY patient alleles
All sex-reversed patients examined in the present study have 46 chromosomes, XY gonadal dysgenesis and single nucleotide transversions that result in substitution of a single amino acid. The detailed clinical profiles for patients carrying the R76P, R133W, F67V, M64T and Y127C alleles have been described previously [3,4,9].

Plasmid construction
Plasmids encoding GFP (green fluorescent protein)-SRY-HMG or GFP-SRY-FL (full-length) proteins for mammalian cell expression, and His6-tagged GFP-SRY-HMG for bacterial expression were generated using GatewayTM technology (Invitrogen) [19]. SRY-HMG (residues 55-141) and full-length constructs were generated by PCR as described previously [13,20], using primers containing attB sites to enable the derivation of expression plasmids via recombination. The control constructs encoding GFP-CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding protein)-(252- 341) and GFP-T-ag [SV40 (simian virus 40) large tumour antigen]-(111-135) [19] were derived similarly. Point mutations in SRY-FL- and SRY-HMG-box-encoding plasmids were introduced using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). Subsequent to confirmation by DNA sequencing, the mutated sequences were recombined into the various expression constructs as described above. In the case of plasmids encoding the pEGFP-SOX-HMG domains of the SOX2 [21], SOX9 [22] and SOX10 [23] proteins for mammalian cell expression, the HMG domains were amplified by PCR using appropriate primers and cloned into the BamHI/BglII sites of

COS-7 African green monkey kidney, GC-2 mouse germ, TM4 mouse Sertoli, P19 mouse embryonic carcinoma, HeLa cervical cancer and rat HTC (hepatoma tissue culture) cell lines were all cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) (ICN), supplemented with 10 % (v/v) heat inactivated FBS (fetal bovine serum) (CSL), 1 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM penicillin/streptomycin and 20 mM Hepes, with the exception of TM4 cells which were cultured in 1:1 Ham's F12/DMEM, supplemented with 1 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM penicillin/streptomycin, 20 mM Hepes and 5 % (v/v) FBS in a 5 % CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 C.
Transfection/CLSM (confocal laser-scanning microscopy)
COS-7, GC-2 and HeLa cells were transfected using LipofectamineTM (Invitrogen) 16 h after plating according to the manufacturer's instructions, whereas TM4 and P19 cell lines were transfected using Mirus LT-1 (Mirus TransIT®). Cells were imaged live by CLSM (Bio-Rad Laboratories MRC-500) using a 40× water-immersion objective 24 h p.t. (post-transfection), and image analysis of digitized confocal images was performed using the ImageJ (NIH) public domain software. Nuclear (Fn) and cytoplasmic (Fc) fluorescence was determined subsequent to the subtraction of autofluorescence (also quantified), and used to derive the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio (Fn/c), a parameter that enables differences in expression levels between individual transfected cells to be standardized. Where indicated, cells were treated with 5, 2 or 1.2 M CDZ (COS-7/GC-2/HeLa, TM4 and P19 cells respectively) 12 h p.t. or 8 h p.t. for HeLa cells before CLSM imaging/image analysis as above.
Subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting
COS-7 cells were transfected to express GFP-SRY constructs and subcellular fractionation as described previously [25]. Briefly, intact cells were harvested 24 h p.t. using 0.02 % EDTA and washed twice with PBS, and nuclei were extracted upon incubation in nuclei isolation buffer {320 mM sucrose, 0.1 % Triton X-100 and CompleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche) in IB [intracellular buffer: 110 mM KCl, 5 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM CaCl2 and 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4)]} for 5 min on ice. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 g for 5 min at 4 C, the cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant) was collected, and intact nuclei were washed twice and lysed with 1 % CHAPS and CompleteTM protease inhibitor cocktail for 5 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20 000 g at 4 C for 5 min [25]. Nuclei and cytoplasmic extracts were then subjected to SDS/PAGE (12 % gel) and transferred on to a PVDF membrane that was probed with anti-GFP (1:1000 dilution; Roche), anti-(histone 2B) (1:500 dilution; Millipore) or anti-/-tubulin (1:500 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies followed by HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated goat anti-(mouse IgG) (1:10 000 dilution; Millipore) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-(rabbit IgG) (1:10 000 dilution; Millipore) antibodies before development using the Western Lighting Chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer). Densitometric analysis was performed on digitized images of immunoblots using ImageJ software. Nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) density was determined and used to derive the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio (N/C) to assess the presence of GFP-SRY in

the nucleus compared with cytoplasm. Immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates indicated that all constructs were expressed to comparable levels and in intact form (see Supplementary Figure S1 at http://BiochemJ.org/bj/430/bj4300039add.htm).
Bacterial expression and biotinylation of recombinant proteins
WT (wild-type) and mutant SRY-HMG domain variants were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21-Rosetta2 (Novagen) as His6-tagged GFP-fusion proteins [13,19], with expression induced for 4 h using 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl -D-thiogalactoside) at 28 C at a D595 of 0.6, followed by purification under denaturing conditions. Imp1 was purified from bacteria as a GST (glutathione transferase)-fusion protein under native conditions [13], and biotinylated using the sulfo-NHS-biotin (sulfo-Nhydroxysuccinimide biotin) reagent (Pierce) [26].
In vitro nuclear transport assays
Mechanically perforated rat HTC cells were used to assess nuclear import of WT GFP-SRY-HMG in conjunction with CLSM, as described previously [13,27] using a 60× oil-immersion lens, with image analysis performed as above. Experiments were carried out in 5 l volumes, containing 30 M WT GFP-SRY-HMG, a 70 kDa Texas Red-dextran to assess nuclear integrity, untreated reticulocyte lysate (45 g/l) and an ATP-regenerating system (0.125 g/ml creatine kinase, 30 mM creatine phosphate and 2 mM ATP) with and without CDZ, as indicated.
Native PAGE
Native PAGE assays were performed to assess binding [28] of SRY to GST-Imp1 or CaM (Calbiochem); 1 M WT His6- GFP-SRY-HMG was incubated in the absence or presence of 1.5 M GST-Imp1 and/or 6 M CaM (as indicated), in IB supplemented with 2 mM Ca2+ for 20 min at room temperature (22 C), loaded with 40 % sucrose and electrophoresed on a prerun 8 % native polyacrylamide gel for  6 h at 80 V at 4 C in TBE (0.9 M Tris, 1.125 M boric acid and 20 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). Fluoroimaging was then performed using the Wallach Arthur 1422 Multiwavelength Fluorimager to enable visualization of fluorescent protein-protein complexes.
AlphaScreen® assays
AlphaScreen® (amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay screen) determinations of binding constants were performed as described previously [26] in triplicate in a 384-well white opaque plate (PerkinElmer): 30 nM (2 l of 375 nM) of His6tagged proteins were added to each well, followed by 20 l of the appropriate concentration of 0-15 nM biotinylated Imp1 (see above) or biotin-labelled CaM (Calbiochem), prepared by serial dilution in IB (110 mM KCl, 5 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM MgCl2 and 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, with Ca2+ added as indicated). Imp1/CaM binding to proteins was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature. All subsequent additions and incubations were made in subdued lighting conditions due to photosensitivity of the beads; 1 l of a 1:10 dilution of acceptor beads and 1 l of 2.5 % BSA were added simultaneously and incubated for 90 min at room temperature. A 1 l sample of a 1:10 dilution of donor beads was then added to give a final sample volume of 25 l and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The assay was read on a PerkinElmer FusionAlpha plate reader according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Triplicate values were averaged and curve fitting (three-parameter

RESULTS
CaM-NLS mutations impair SRY nuclear accumulation
A number of sex-reversing mutations have been described in SRY (e.g. see Table 1), of particular interest being those that do not have any impact on any known activities of SRY, including DNA binding and bending [10]. To test whether these affect SRY's nuclear import capabilities directly, plasmids encoding GFP-SRY fusion proteins (both SRY-FL and SRY-HMG) with or without the M64T, F67V, R76P, Y127C and R133W point mutations (Figure 1A) were transiently expressed in the testicular TM4 Sertoli cell line, and cells were subjected to CLSM imaging (Figure 1B). Exclusively nuclear localization was observed for the WT SRY protein, with clear cytoplasmic localization in addition to nuclear accumulation observed for all of the NLS mutant derivatives (Figure 1B). This result was confirmed by quantifying the extent of nuclear accumulation through image analysis (see Figure 1C), whereby the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio (Fn/c) was determined as described previously [29,30]. The extent of nuclear accumulation of SRY appeared to be similar for full-length and HMG-derivative constructs, with the WT constructs showing Fn/c values of  60 (indicative of 60-fold higher levels in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm). In comparison, constructs containing the -NLS and CaM-NLS mutations showed significantly (P < 0.01) reduced ( 40 -80 %) levels of nuclear accumulation (Fn/c <30; see Figure 1C). Essentially identical results were observed for the constructs expressed in the GC-2 testicular (see Figures 4C and 4D and Table 1) and P19 embryonic carcinoma (results not shown) cell lines, as well as the COS-7 cell line from kidney (see below), suggesting that the mechanisms determining nuclear import of SRY are not specific to testicular cells.
These results were confirmed by immunoblot/densitometric analysis on separated nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions for COS-7 cells transiently transfected to express the indicated GFP- SRY proteins (Figures 2A and 2B); probing the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions using anti-/-tubulin and anti-(histone 2B) antibodies (Figure 2C) confirmed the integrity of the fractionation approach, with only /-tubulin detected in the cytoplasmic fraction and only histone 2B identified in the nuclear fraction. The analysis shown in Figure 2A (upper panel) indicates increased amounts of WT GFP-SRY-HMG in the nuclear fraction

compared with the cytoplasmic fraction, with clearly increased amounts of GFP-SRY in the cytoplasmic fractions for all of the mutant proteins. Densitometric analysis (Figure 2A, lower panel) to determine the relative nuclear to cytoplasmic levels (N/C, subsequent to subtraction for background signal) indicated significantly (P < 0.026) reduced N/Cs for the M64T, R76P and R133W mutants (71, 44 and 60 % respectively), compared with WT. Similar results were observed for analysis of GFP-SRY-FL proteins (Figure 2B), with significantly (P < 0.007) higher levels of WT GFP-SRY-FL protein in the nuclear fraction compared with the cytoplasmic fraction, compared with the M64T, R76P and R133W (93, 29 and 71 % reduced N/Cs respectively compared with WT) NLS mutant derivatives. These results clearly support the idea that sex-reversing mutations in both the CaM- and -NLS impair SRY nuclear accumulation in living cells, completely consistent with the results generated by CLSM analysis (Figure 1); the results strongly imply that CaM plays an important role in SRY nuclear import.
CaM antagonists inhibit SRY nuclear accumulation
To establish the dependence on CaM for SRY nuclear import, cells were initially transfected to express WT GFP-SRY-FL protein and treated 12 h p.t. with the potent and specific CaM antagonist CDZ, a widely used imidazole compound which binds directly to CaM to prevent binding to and modulation of the activity of CaM's various specific binding partners [16,31]. Cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation, as above, 24 h p.t. and immunoblot analysis performed to demonstrate higher levels of GFP-SRY-FL in the cytoplasmic fraction upon CDZ treatment (Figure 3A, upper panel). This was confirmed by densitometric analysis (Figure 3A, lower panel), indicating significantly (P = 0.0095) lower (approx. 63 % reduced) levels of GFP-SRY-FL in the nuclear fraction compared with the cytoplasmic fraction in the presence of CDZ.
In a second approach, nuclear transport of WT GFP-SRY-HMG protein was reconstituted in vitro using mechanically perforated HTC cells as described previously [10,13,32] and the transport kinetics determined using quantitative CLSM. WT SRY was seen to accumulate strongly in intact nuclei (Figure 3B, left-hand panel); quantitative analysis of the extent of nuclear accumulation confirming this observation (Figure 3B, right-hand panel), with a maximal Fn/c of 4 observed after a period of 15 min in the presence of exogenously added cytosol. Addition of 70 M CDZ resulted in significantly (P = 0.0006) reduced (42 %) maximal nuclear accumulation of WT SRY (Table 2). Similar results were observed for SRY in the absence of exogenously added cytosol,

In a third approach, cells transfected to express the indicated GFP-SRY-HMG protein were treated with CDZ 12 h p.t. and imaged with CLSM.

of CREB [33] (Figures 4A and 4B). In all cases, no effect of CDZ treatment was evident, with no increase in cytoplasmic fluorescence observed (Figure 4A), and quantitative analysis supported this idea (Figure 4B). Clearly, the effects observed for SRY appear to be specific and not the result of general effects of CaM antagonism upon the nuclear transport machinery/Imps/Ran etc.
Similar experiments were performed for the constructs carrying the -NLS and CaM-NLS mutations (Figures 4C and 4D). Although already showing increased cytoplasmic fluorescence in the case of the -NLS and CaM-NLS sex-reversing mutations compared with WT, a further significant (P < 0.02)  30-50 % reduction in nuclear accumulation in the presence of CDZ was observed for proteins carrying the R133W and Y127C mutations in the -NLS (Figures 4C and 4D). Intriguingly, the proteins

carrying the M64T, F67V and R76P mutations in the CaMNLS did not show a further reduction (Figures 4C and 4D) in nuclear accumulation upon CDZ treatment beyond the lower level of accumulation already observed in its absence. The clear implication was that the CaM-NLS mutations impair SRY's CaMdependent nuclear import pathway.
CaM-NLS mutations impair CaM binding to SRY
To test whether the CaM-NLS mutations affect SRY binding to CaM directly, bacterially expressed His6-tagged GFP-SRY-HMG derivatives were initially analysed by native PAGE, whereby SRY proteins were incubated with either CaM (in the presence of Ca2+) or Imp1 and then subjected to electrophoresis; SRY alone shows

was used to confirm these results, as well as to provide an
estimate of the binding affinities of the respective SRY proteins for CaM and Imp1. His6-GFP-SRY-HMG showed high-affinity binding to both CaM (dependent on Ca2+, results not shown) and Imp1, with apparent dissociation constants (Kd values) of  0.43 and 0.94 nM respectively (Table 3). SRY fusion proteins carrying sex-reversing CaM-NLS mutations all showed significantly (P < 0.004) reduced CaM binding (Table 3); the R76P variant, for example, showed a 4-fold higher Kd for CaM (2.05 nM; Table 3 and Figure 5B, middle panels). In contrast, the -NLS Y127C-carrying SRY fusion protein showed normal CaM binding (Figure 5B, bottom panels). Consistent with the results for native PAGE, the CaM-NLS mutants all bound to Imp1 with high affinity comparable with WT, in contrast with the Y127C mutant, which showed  4-fold higher Kd and significantly (P < 0.0001) impaired Imp1 binding (Table 3 and Figure 5B, bottom panels). Both native PAGE and AlphaScreen® assay results clearly imply that the CaM-NLS mutations directly affect CaM, but not Imp1 binding; this presumably represents the basis of the reduced
nuclear localization (Figures 1, 2 and 4) and lack of CDZ
sensitivity of nuclear accumulation (Figure 3) of SRY carrying
CaM-NLS mutations compared with WT.

Figure 5 Sex-reversing mutations in the CaM-NLS specifically impair binding to CaM, but not Imp1, as shown using native PAGE and AlphaScreen® assays
(A) A native PAGE gel mobility-shift assay (see the Materials and methods section) for Imp1 and CaM binding to GFP-SRY-HMG WT and M64T mutant was performed, where GFP-SRY-HMG (1 M) was incubated in the absence and presence of Imp1 (1.5 M) and CaM (6 M) in the presence of Ca2+ (2 mM) for 20 min at room temperature, and then fluoroimaging was performed subsequent to PAGE (see the Materials and methods section). Results are shown for a single typical assay from a series of two similar experiments. (B) AlphaScreen® assays were performed as described in the Materials and methods section. Results are shown for a single typical experiment (pooled data are shown in Table 2), with the apparent dissociation constants (K d) indicated for binding of biotinylated CaM (left) or biotinylated Imp1 (right) to SRY-HMG (WT and mutants). Results for regression analysis (r value) for the accuracy of the curve fitting are presented in all cases.
a diffuse band in the absence of a binding partner as observed previously [13], with a focused band indicative of complex formation [13,26,30,31]. Figure 5(A) shows typical contrasting results for the comparison of WT with the M64T CaM-NLS mutant derivative, where the latter shows a clear lack of complex formation with CaM, but essentially normal binding to Imp1. Table 3 summarizes the data for all of the mutants analysed, where the CaM-NLS mutants in all cases showed reduced CaM binding, but normal Imp1 binding, whereas the -NLS Y127C mutationcarrying SRY fusion protein bound CaM in similar fashion to the WT SRY protein (but showed impaired Imp1 binding).
Although the native PAGE indicated markedly reduced CaM and normal Imp1 binding for CaM-NLS mutants, a more

CaM-dependent nuclear transport is conserved in HMG proteins
The results above strongly implicate CaM as playing a critical role in SRY nuclear import in fetal development and sex determination. Intriguingly, the HMG box of SRY is >50 % conserved in other SOX family members which play key roles in development [34], with striking homology evident within the CaM-NLS (Figure 6A), implying conservation of function. To test whether these sequences may be functional in conferring CaM-dependent nuclear localization, HeLa cells were transiently transfected to express various GFP-SOX-HMG (SOX2-HMG, SOX9-HMG and SOX10-HMG) domains as well as the more distantly related HMGN1 nucleosomal binding protein, with CDZ added 16 h p.t, followed by CLSM imaging 8 h later. All GFP-SOX-HMG proteins, as well as GFP-HMGN1, showed exclusively nuclear accumulation (Figure 6B), with >30-fold higher levels of protein in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm (Fn/c  30; Figures 6B and 6C). Significantly, in the presence of CDZ, increased cytoplasmic fluorescence was evident (Figure 6B), which was confirmed by quantitative analysis, which indicated significantly (P < 0.005) reduced (30-70 %) nuclear accumulation for all of the HMG domain-containing proteins in the presence of CDZ (Figure 6C). This was in contrast with the control proteins GFP and T-ag, which showed no effect of CDZ (Figures 6B and 6C). The results clearly imply that SOX proteins similar to SRY as well as the more distantly related HMGN1 protein possess a functional CaM-dependent nuclear import pathway. CaM-dependent nuclear import thus appears to be an intrinsic property of the HMG domain of SOX proteins, and HMG proteins generally.
DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrates for the first time a specific role for CaM in nuclear import of HMG-box family nuclear factors, as well as the central importance thereof for SRY's role in sex determination, in that CaM-NLS mutations specifically impairing CaM binding/SRY nuclear import result in sex reversal. Since the M64T and R76P CaM-NLS mutants show essentially normal DNA-binding and -bending activities [9,10], the only detectable

effect of the mutations, as demonstrated for the first time, is impaired CaM binding and consequently impaired nuclear import. Significantly, there is a clear correlation between the extent of the reduction in CaM binding and in nuclear accumulation for these mutants; the M64T mutation results in more severely impaired CaM binding ( 5-fold higher Kd; see Tables 1 and 3), and a 2-3-fold reduction in nuclear accumulation as a consequence (see Table 1 and Figures 2A and 2B), whereas the R76P mutant shows a smaller effect in terms of the reduction in CaM-binding affinity ( 3-fold higher Kd), and a consequently lower ( 1.5-fold) reduction in nuclear accumulation. Clearly, the affinity of CaM binding is critical to nuclear import efficiency, with even a  3-fold reduction in binding affinity able to have a significant effect on nuclear accumulation, and in turn likely to be the basis of sex reversal in vivo.
The present study clearly implies that the CaM-dependent CaM-NLS-mediated nuclear import pathway of SRY is essential for sex determination. That CaM's role is almost certainly in nuclear entry rather than in facilitating SRY nuclear retention is consistent with the fact that SRY nuclear accumulation does not appear to involve binding to nuclear components [13] and that the CaM-NLS alone is sufficient to target even large carrier proteins to the nucleus [10,35]. CaM is known to be able to localize in either nucleus or cytoplasm in various tissues including the testis [15]; the exact mechanism by which it mediates/contributes to SRY nuclear import remains to be determined, but one possibility is that CaM facilitates nuclear import through mediating direct interaction of SRY with the NPC. Subsequent to this, CaM release from SRY is likely to be effected by DNA binding in the nucleus, which has been shown in vitro [12]. Since CaM is ubiquitous in essentially all cell types, this mechanism appears to be unlikely to relate uniquely to the testis, but rather to essentially all tissues/cell types, consistent with the effects of CaM antagonism on HMGfamily nuclear factor transport shown in the present study for the widely used COS-7 and HeLa cell lines (Figures 2, 3 and 6).
The results of the present study and others indicate that SRY has distinct dual nuclear import pathways mediated by the CaMNLS through CaM and -NLS through Imp1. Mutation in either NLS can lead to sex reversal, despite the fact that nuclear import through the other NLS is functional. The most informative mutations in this respect are the M64T/R76P CaM-NLS and R133W -NLS (see [10]) mutations, none of which markedly affects DNA binding and bending, all only specifically impairing the nuclear import pathways mediated by the NLS in which they are mutated. The fact that all of these mutations cause sex reversal indicates clearly that both nuclear import pathways are essential to SRY's function in sex determination; perturbing either pathway is sufficient to result in a failure to form a testis. The implication of this is that the level of SRY in the nucleus is critical to sex determination, consistent with its potential role as a repressor of genes responsible for embryonic female development [3,4].
Importantly, the results of the present study have wider implications in that they indicate for the first time that the nuclear accumulation of SOX proteins distinct from SRY also appear to be dependent on CaM, along with the HMGN1, consistent with the homology in their respective HMG domains. The clear implication is that there is a general role for CaM in mediating the nuclear transport of HMG proteins, consistent with the recent observation that the Nhp6Ap yeast HMG box protein may have a CaM-dependent Ran-independent nuclear import pathway [18]. The present study and that for Nhp6Ap [18] thus establish a role for CaM in mediating nuclear transport, highlighting yet another important function for this versatile protein. Detailed examination of the molecular basis of this is the focus of future work in this laboratory.

ABSTRACT Objectives: We aimed to conduct culturally-based
participatory research to assess cultural and belief contexts for smoking behaviours within Mandarin and Cantonese communities. Outcome variables were smoking-related knowledge, smoking patterns, attitudes and beliefs, and perceived barriers and facilitators to successful cessation.
Design: A community-based approach was applied
involving smokers, community key-informants and professionals in study design and implementation. Initially, focus groups were conducted and findings were used to develop study instrument. Participants responded once to study questionnaire after informed consent.
Setting: Community based in the Greater Vancouver
Area, Canada.
Participants: 16 Chinese smokers participated in
focus groups and subsequently, 167 current Chinese immigrant (137 males and 30 females) smokers from Mandarin and Cantonese communities, recruited with the help of community agencies and collaborating physicians, were enrolled in a cross-sectional study.
Results: We found that a majority believed smoking
was harmful on their health. Younger smokers (<35 years of age) did not mind smoking in front of young children compared to older smokers (35 years of age) ( p<0.001). People with high school or lower levels of education believed that they would benefit more from smoking than suffering from withdrawal symptoms compared to better educated smokers ( p<0.05). Mandarin smokers were significantly more likely to encourage others to quit than Cantonese smokers ( p<0.05). Many indicated not receiving adequate support from care providers and lack of access to culturally and linguistically appropriate cessation programmes impacted on their ability to quit smoking.
Conclusions: Our study highlighted the importance of
tobacco beliefs and perceptions among Mandarin and Cantonese speaking immigrants with limited access to healthcare information and for younger smokers whose attention to health consequences of smoking may be limited as well. Study participants were generally aware

Strengths and limitations of this study
 We undertook a community-based participatory approach, with community key-informants and healthcare providers being heavily involved in all aspects of the study such as design, instrument development, implementation, community outreach and dissemination. These key-stakeholders are important allies in developing culturally and linguistically appropriate smoking cessation interventions.
 Our study provides evidence that attitudes and beliefs towards cigarette smoking differ between groups based on language, age, and gender. The differences with regards to tobacco smoking appear to be related to attitudes or knowledge.
 The results build a window of opportunity to promote tailored cessation interventions incorporating cultural beliefs, perceptions, and practices for Chinese immigrant communities.
 We used a convenience sampling method, which may not reflect the actual smoking prevalence and patterns of Chinese Mandarin and Cantonese immigrants in the Greater Vancouver Area.
 All responses were by self-report and validation of smoking behaviours or reasons to quit or continue smoking was not possible with a crosssectional design.
of the health risks and were willing to quit. Access to appropriate cessation programmes would fulfil their willingness.
BACKGROUND Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the world.1-3 In Canada, its use has been declining slower than expected in spite of increased taxation on cigarettes and more stringent tobacco policies put into place.3

In order to accomplish the goal of reducing the rate of smokers among Canadian adults, smoking has to be addressed among all subpopulations, especially those with a higher smoking prevalence than the general population. Global studies have shown that those who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk of developing cardiopulmonary disease and that in general the longer the period of cessation, the greater is the reduction in risk.4 5 Minority and immigrant communities in Canada may be at greater risk of smoking-related illnesses.6 Reasons include lack of knowledge and awareness about the link between smoking and lung disease7; limited access to smoking cessation programmes due to cultural, language, and systemic barriers; 8 and smoking behaviours.9 10 In addition, many immigrants from low-and-middle-income countries have had prior significant exposure to biomass and biofuel as well as smoking which further increases their risk.11 This is particularly true among immigrants from Mandarin and Cantonese speaking communities (the largest immigrant minority groups living in the BC and Canada)12 13 where smoking rates remains high.9 10 Such extensive tobacco use among immigrants may be due to the fact that smoking is a largely integrated into the Chinese male culture.14 Nearly two of every three adult men in China are smokers.15 16 It is, therefore, empirically relevant to try to understand this immigrant group's smoking knowledge, behaviours, and habits and develop culturally appropriate educational and counselling services to improve tobacco prevention attempts and promote cessation. Maximising tobacco control for newcomers requires a special understanding of smoking pattern and beliefs of new immigrant populations. The objectives of this study were: (1) to explore smoking use patterns, smoking-related knowledge, beliefs and attitudes, and perceived barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation among Mandarin and Cantonese speaking communities living in the Greater Vancouver Area (GVA), and (2) to assess the effectiveness of sociocultural and environmental factors which influenced the onset of smoking and smoking habits (continued smoking) among the study participants. We were also interested to identify differences in aforementioned variables between men and women, Mandarin and Cantonese, and between age and education level groups. The identification of tobacco use and other related patterns may help facilitate the development of community-based culturally appropriate interventions targeting tobacco use and would be helpful for future research for Chinese immigrants.
METHODS Project design This multistage cross-sectional study employed qualitative and quantitative components within an over-arching community-based participatory framework. The first stage comprised the development and testing of a measurement instrument for the survey study. The second

stage was a quantitative study assessing the outcome variables including smokers' awareness of smoking and its cessation, attitudes and beliefs about smoking harms and benefits, and cultural norms of smoking in their community.
The study was conducted between January 2013 and June 2014, allowing for participation and collaboration between members of the Mandarin and Cantonese communities and other key-stakeholders such as professionals and researchers in the research process.17-19 Connections and networking were built with community key-informants and community agencies (eg, SUCCESS (United Chinese Community Enrichment Services Society), Vancouver Coastal Health community organisations, etc.) supporting active involvement and contribution in study design, development and implementation. Community collaborators provided assistance with recruitment of Mandarin and Cantonese smokers as well as input and suggestions on the development of focus group and interview questions. They recruited two men and two women who were members of the community, fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese, to work in alliance with four female bilingual Chinese research assistants. All community facilitators and research assistants received appropriate training prior the study. The training included approaches on how to best recruit study participants, understanding of the project's goals and objectives, how to conduct focus groups and individual interviews with smokers from their own communities, and ideas on how the team could work together effectively in collection of the best information possible on Chinese smokers' knowledge, beliefs and attitudes about harms and benefits of smoking, and socio-cultural and environmental factors affecting smoking and smoking cessation. The community researchers transcribed and translated focus group and interview discussions and we applied the collected information in the development of a study measurement tool and conceptual framework. In addition, findings from our previous qualitative smoking study (conducted with smokers from the same communities) were used in the development of the study design and measurement tool.20
All participants signed a written consent form in their preferred written language (Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, or English) translated by the bilingual researchers who clearly explained the study rationale, goals and objectives, and how their involvement would be like prior to the study.
Study measurement tool
We initially developed the study measurement tool by determining whether any English or Chinese language questionnaires were currently in use to assess attitudes and beliefs re smoking in the Chinese community. A literature search and an informal survey of immigrantserving community agencies did not find any such instrument that has been developed in Canadian Chinese context. Given the absence of a validated

assessment questionnaire in the target languages for Canadian Chinese, a new measurement tool was developed over a 4-month period. Development of the study measurement tool began with information collected from initial focus group session participants (n=14) and individual interviews (n=2), review of relevant literature that addressed knowledge of, attitudes to, and behaviours in relation to tobacco use, and also our previous smoking-related qualitative studies with Mandarin and Cantonese current and ex-smokers.20 Moreover, a professional measurement tool developer (a PhD in the sociopsychology research and evaluation field from University of British Columbia) with expertise in developing mixed open-ended and closed-format questionnaires was involved in the face and content validation and finalisation of the measurement tool. The team and the measurement developer have the expertise to identify and differentiate between beliefs, attitudes and perceptions, as well as the sociocultural and environmental aspects of smoking and its cessation. Each set of variables were identified and separated by heading-title in the questionnaire. The internal consistency of the data was checked by test-retesting reliability, where the study questionnaire was administered to five smokers and tested again a week after and the results of the initial assessment and retest were compared. Also, more advanced process was applied by calculating Cronbach  and a coefficient was (0.89).
The final questionnaire covered current smoking knowledge, beliefs and attitudes about smoking and its cessation, and sociocultural and environmental factors that promote or prevent smoking onset and continuation. The tool included 70 questions covering demographics and concepts on smoking onset, smoking characteristics, perceptions, experience in quitting, social relationships and cultural and environmental influences and were in the format of yes/no, true/false, multiple choice, and open-ended questions (The study measurement tool can be found as online supplementary file 1). The questionnaire was also reviewed by a number of key-informants and health practitioners (n=9) from the target communities who provided feedback and comments re the questionnaire and checked its face and content validity. The bilingual Chinese research assistants worked collaboratively together translating the study measurement tool to Chinese Simplified and Traditional formats. The translations were reviewed by secondary (back-up) translators from the target communities who were introduced by the collaborating immigrant agencies for accuracy and correctness. The tool was then reviewed by the community key-informants and professionals for further crosschecking. Finally we pilot tested the questionnaire with selected smokers and ex-smokers from the Chinese communities (n=5) to confirm validation of the measurement tool and for cultural relevance and clarification, as well as translation purposes including understandability, acceptability and applicability. Suggestions were integrated into a revised version.

Participant recruitment Eligibility criteria for participants were adults (21 years old) who were current smokers (defined by having smoked at least five cigarettes per day during the past 30 days), Chinese descent (either Mandarin or Cantonese speaking) and be immigrants to Canada or children of Chinese immigrants. Participants were recruited from within the communities using a variety of outreach methods such as posting flyers and referral applied from previous studies and through network with community agency collaborators.17 21 22 In total, 16 Chinese smokers participated in initial focus groups and interviews and subsequently 167 (137 males and 30 females) were interviewed, from which 93 were Mandarin speaking and 73 were Cantonese speaking. In terms of age category, 90 participants were <35 years of age and 76 were 35 years of age. Our intended sample size was 150 Chinese smokers aiming to identify mean differences in knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and practices related to smoking and experience in smoking cessation between age, gender, education and ethnicity groups.
Data collection Data were collected through administration of study questionnaire via individual interviews. Interview sessions were conducted at places and times of convenience for participants: for example, participants' homes, community centres, and our research centre. Printed consent forms were explained and signed preceding the interview. Modest honoraria were paid to cover time, travel and parking expenses. Community research assistants conducted the interviews in Mandarin or Cantonese and the participants filled in a self-reported Chinese Simplified and Chinese Traditional questionnaire while the research assistants were available to answer any questions that they would have had, or ask the responders to elaborate the given information in the open-ended questions. Each interview was conducted by two interviewers: one with an academic perspective (a research assistant), and one from community who acted as a facilitator. The two interviewers took notes during interviews including verbal and non-verbal communication by the participants and reviewed their notes at the end of each interview aiming to improve the accuracy of the information, capturing smokers' smoking beliefs, perceptions, and also their comments about cultural images of smoking and its cessation. In some instances (eg, old smokers or low literate people), the research assistants assisted by administered the study questionnaire verbally while taking notes throughout the entire interview.
Data analysis SPSS V.20 (2012) was used for all statistical tests. Descriptive statistical tests were used and the results were presented in tables and graphs. Relevant inferential statistics were calculated for the entire sample and stratified according to age, gender, level of education, language of origin and smoking practices. The data were not

normally distributed, and non-parametric tests were therefore used; for example, 2 test for nominal data, Mann-Whitney test for ordinal data with two groups, and Kruskal-Wallis test for more than two groups with ordinal data. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the effects of demographics on the outcome variables. All data were examined regarding distributions and trends in the data, and the level of significance was set at the p<0.05 level.
Sample size calculation With a total sample size of 167 participants for the crosssectional study, we estimated that we could identify mean differences between different age, gender, language and education level groups and with an effect size of 0.45 with 80% statistical power and a two-sided significance level of p<0.05.
FINDINGS Between May 2013 and April 2014, we recruited and enrolled 167 current smokers. Table 1 describes characteristics of the study sample for Mandarin (55.7%, n=93) and Cantonese (44.3%, n=74). The participants included predominately males (82%, n=137). The median age was 35 and we used this cut-off point for younger/older groups, as used previously from our qualitative studies conducted with Chinese community smokers,20 allowing us to identify these differences in perspective.
Smoking-related knowledge and reasons for starting smoking Knowledge of smoking consequences is an important factor to consider when designing smoking cessation programmes or implementing health promotion interventions, especially to prevent onset of smoking among young people.2 8 Almost an equal number (23%) of Mandarin and Cantonese smokers indicated that they were not aware of smoking side effects when they started smoking. Table 2 provides the breakdown of smoking-related knowledge by gender, age, language

and education level. As shown on table 2, knowledge about side effects of smoking was mixed among the participants of this study, with no statistically significant differences observed between the language, gender, age and education groups in this regard.
We also aimed to determine the sociocultural and environmental factors which influenced the onset of smoking among the study participants.23 In this study, we defined social factors as smoking during the gatherings, being offered cigarettes by peers (a cultural norm in this community), smoking to feel being accepted, etc. On average for 45% (n=75) of participants, `social factors' were a trigger to start smoking, while it was the number one trigger for male smokers and smokers with who were 35 years or over with an equal rate of 53%. Although 50% of females mentioned `emotional factors' as a contributor to starting smoking, only 22% (on average) of males cited these as factors for them. Likewise, `environmental factors' were considered by only 20% of participants as a factor in starting to smoke, while 50% of Mandarin smokers mentioned environmental factors as a major trigger for them to start smoking. A smoking friend was mentioned by most of participants (66.3%) as someone in their social network when starting smoking, compared to classmate (48.5%), family (29%) and work-related colleagues (28%). An interesting observation was that 50% of female smokers in the study identified having a family member who smoked when they first started smoking.
Smoking beliefs, perceptions, and attitudes Multiple factors affected participants to become regular smokers. For instance, for around 62% of smokers (between 100 and 104), the main reasons to smoke regularly were the beliefs that smoking `relaxed them' and `helped them feel less stress' as well as when `they were having a break' or when `they were bored'. The breakdown of the triggers to smoke based on smokers' gender, age,

language and education groups are shown on table 3, with no statistically significant differences observed
between the male and female smokers, and different age, language and education groups in this regard.
We were also interested to identify the social and cultural aspects of smoking habits (continued smoking). When asked the question of whether `most people in my culture smoke' to assess participants' perceived commonality of smoking in their communities, there was a significant difference between male and female participants (2=5.424, df=1, p<0.05) ; more males (n=46, 34%)
believed that smoking was a cultural habit in their community than females (n=17, 57%) did. Similar findings
were observed between Mandarin and Cantonese (2=5.182, df=1, p<0.05); more Mandarin (n=65) answered yes to the question than Cantonese smokers
(n=39). Many participants (61%) indicated they normally smoked when they were `with friends'; with the highest proportion reported among the <35 years old
participants (82%) and male participants (70%).
Remarkably, 70% of the <35 years old participants indicated they smoked when they had alcohol. The rate was
60% among female participants, 57% among males, and
57% among both Mandarin and Cantonese smokers. In terms of attitudes towards exposing others to second or third-hand smoke, we asked participants `do you mind smoking in front of non-smokers' ? Younger smokers (<35 years of age) were more likely (n=72) to mention
that they did not mind smoking in front of non-smokers compared to older smokers (35 years of age) (n=52). The mean difference was significant (2=7.133, df=1,
p<0.01). Also, when the participants were asked whether
they minded smoking in front of young children, similarly, more younger smokers (<35 years of age) (n=97) mentioned that they `did not mind smoking in front of young children' than the older smokers (n=55) and the difference was significant (2=5.123, df=1, p<0.05). We also aimed to assess smokers' viewpoints regarding
second hand smoking and its harm. We asked whether `second and third hand smoke was as harmful as first hand smoke', again, relatively more males said `no' when

compared to female smokers (n=40 and n=10, respectively) and the difference was significant (2=4.736, df=1, p<0.05). Finally, we assessed smokers' beliefs about their own smoking pattern with a self-reported question of `I have a smoking routine/pattern'. No significant differences were identified between gender, age, and language groups. However, we found that more people with high school education or less mentioned they did not have a routine/pattern (n=30) compared to people with higher education (n=12) and the difference was significant (2=7.156, df=1, p<0.01).
Perceptions about smoking We assessed smokers' perceived enjoyable feeling that they may have due to smoking by asking whether `there is a different feeling when comparing times I smoke and don't smoke' and found a statistically significant difference between male and female participants (2=4.237; df=1, p<0.05). Significantly more males (n=47) mentioned experiencing a different feeling when they smoked compared to not smoking than female smokers (n=15). In addition, younger smokers (<35 years of age) as well claimed to have a different feeling when comparing times smoking and not smoking (n=46) compared to older smokers (n=16), and the differences were statistically significant (2=3.889, df=1, p<0.05). Likewise, more Mandarin smokers (n=41) than Cantonese smokers (n=20) reported having a different feeling when they smoke compared to when they were not smoking (2=5.188, df=1, p<0.05). For this outcome there was no significant differences between highly educated (college/university and above) and lower educated (high school or lower).
Additionally, we assessed smokers' perceptions about helpfulness of smoking to alleviate their anxiety and stress. We noticed that 77% of female smokers, 69% of younger smokers (aged 34 years or younger), and 52% of older smokers (age 35 or older) smoked to reduce their sense of helpfulness. Male smokers perceived that smoking helped them to minimise the feeling of being bored (80%) and made them more connected to their group of friends (69%).

Smoking cessation
We aimed to identify willingness to quit smoking and perceived barriers and facilitators to cessation. The majority of participants, in particular young male and female smokers, mentioned their desire to quit and attempted to several times, before giving up and smoking again. A few people mentioned using medications or seeking professional advice to quit smoking but mainly relied on their own willpower to quit. Also, older participants indicated trying to quit due to health-related issues such as heart disease or cancer. We were also interested to find out whether participants were under pressure by someone close to them to quit smoking. When asked "I was nagged by someone to quit smoking", no statistically significant differences were identified in different gender, age, language and education groups. However, when we asked whether they "would encourage others to quit", more Mandarin speaking smokers answered yes to (n=45) than Cantonese speaking smokers (n=23) (2=5.172, df=1, p<0.05). No significant differences were identified based on age, gender and level of education. In addition, most participants (87%) said `No' to the question: "Would you encourage non-smokers to smoke?" Furthermore, we also asked whether living in a smoking restricted society like Canada would encourage smokers to quit or cut down on their smoking. More Mandarin speaking smokers (n=56, 60%) mentioned that "living in Canada influenced their smoking habits or desire to quit", compared to Cantonese speaking smokers (n=30, 41%) (2=6.424, df=1, p=0.011).
More people with high school or lower education (n=34) agreed with the statement "I would benefit more from smoking than suffering from withdrawal symptoms due to quitting", compared to the more educated smokers (n=12) (2=6.102, df=1, p<0.05). When asked whether they "tried nicotine replacement therapy to quit smoking", more Mandarin speaking smokers (n=32) mentioned that they had tried this aid to quit smoking compared to Cantonese speaking smokers (n=12 (2=7.275, df=1, p=0.007).
In general, participants identified language and literacy issues as barriers to accessing smoking cessation information as well as lack of useful information in a social media format. For instance, older participants mentioned that they had limited exposure to public sources of information on cessation services that were developed in their native language. A small minority of these smokers had received advice and information about the health issues attributed to smoking from their physicians. Younger smokers mentioned the lack of disseminating smoking cessation messages through social media such as text messaging to promote quitting services in their native language.
Our synthesis of the interview data identified seven barriers to the participants' cessation which are summarised in box 1.

Box 1 Barriers to smoking cessation identified by the participants
A. The problems of managing their lives in a highly stressful environment.
B. Their isolation and the limited support systems in their community or work/school environments.
C. The availability of smoking as a social-connection to their peers and limited resources for pleasure.
D. Perceived minimal health risks of smoking. E. The commonality of smoking in their community. F. The scarce or non-existent information about how to stop
smoking. G. The belief that all they can quit on their own whenever they
decide to.
DISCUSSION The main goal of this study was to gain insights on the beliefs and perceptions associated with smoking behaviours and smoking cessation among Chinese Cantonese and Mandarin speaking current smokers, taking into account culturally specific knowledge and practices. The results have implications for the development of appropriate smoking cessation programmes and educational interventions to prevent and control tobacco-related health issues among the target communities. Such interventions may have policy implications in health promotion programmes to prevent smoking onset among younger population groups in the immigrant communities.
Several participants in this study indicated their desire to quit and attempted to do so many times, many of whom did it relying on their own willpower. Only a few, mainly among older smokers, tried to quit because of health-related issues. They mentioned that a better communication with primary care providers and ease of access to culturally and linguistically appropriate smoking cessation resources would promote smoking cessation in their communities. Similar findings have been reported in studies done in other countries as well as among many immigrant communities in Canada who tried to quit smoking.24-27 In addition to elucidating these barriers to smoking cessation and despite continued smoking, participants showed being knowledgeable in health related and other negative aspects of smoking as on average, 70% of the participants indicated they were aware of the health consequences of smoking. This finding has been confirmed in other studies.27 In our study, we found that higher education, better knowledge, and smoking regulations contributed to having a greater intent to quit smoking. For instance, we found that most participants were not ignorant of the dangers of smoking, with the vast majority recognising that smoking posed risks to their own health and the health of those around them. This knowledge is much higher than that of Chinese smokers who were previously surveyed in China, where only 36% of participants believed smoking can cause lung cancer and only 4% were aware of the relationship of smoking to heart disease.28 In addition,

6

many of the smokers in our study already accepted limitations on the use of cigarettes in Canada, and many, mostly younger smokers, supported restrictions on indoor smoking and also mentioned not smoking at home or where children are present. This could be attributed to the smoking restriction rules as well as the strong antismoking educational campaigns in Canada. For example, since 2001, Health Canada has spent more than $480 million for a 5-year programme to encourage tobacco cessation programmes for all Canadians.29 These regulations might be important to reduce the risk of second-hand and third-hand smoking and related health issues among young children and other nonsmoker family members.
In terms of reasons to continue smoking, perceived advantages of smoking such as `smoking does make me feel more comfortable' and `smoking helps me to be stress-free when I have problems' appeared to be more important factors to promote smoking continuation among our study participants than perceived disadvantages around `health issues' and `money' which shown to be strong motivators in quitting smoking in some studies. Some studies found that smokers may not be aware of the diseases caused by smoking and therefore, they may perceive themselves less susceptible to the risks of smoking.29-33 For instance, health consequences and costs of smoking were not perceived as strong motivators to quit smoking among young participants. They reported the stimulating and antistress effects of smoking (smoking may actually made them feel happier, more alert, etc), the feelings that may reinforce their tobacco use and have associated these feelings with being around other smokers. In older smokers, most of which showed low self-efficacy on being able to quit, the rationale for continuing to smoke was different. For instance, for over 16% of smokers in this age group the disadvantages of quitting were perceived to outweigh its advantages. Some reasons mentioned by older participants were: the addiction of nicotine, being too late to quit, and that their body needed nicotine. In other studies among mainstream populations, self-efficacy expectations and advantages of smoking cessation appeared to be the most important associates of quitting smoking among older smokers.34 35 Therefore, this issue should be revisited in future studies with ethnocultural communities. The results of this study suggest that understanding health beliefs and perceptions around smoking and improving self-efficacy are useful tools in promoting smoking cessation among smokers in Chinese immigrant communities.
Limitations
Some limitations need to be considered. First, this study used a convenience sample, so it may not reflect the actual smoking prevalence and patterns among Mandarin and Cantonese immigrants in the GVA. We could not explore the effect of acculturation on smoking habits and patterns. There was no previous data on smoking patterns among Chinese immigrants in

Open Access
Canada, and attempting a community based assessment would have been inherently difficult for an exploratory study. Therefore the findings of this study cannot be generalised to larger Mandarin and Cantonese speaking communities residing in the GVA. The goal was to explore the links to smoking cessation among Mandarin and Cantonese populations in order to gain insight into the need to adapt smoking cessation programmes in these groups. In future research, a longitudinal design in which our results can be tested is recommended. A second limitation is the fact that all responses were by self-report and validation of smoking behaviours or reasons to quit or continue smoking was not possible with a cross-sectional design. A third limitation is the absence of a native mainstream (English-speaking) reference group, due to a lack of resources. This could be a problem for interpreting the additional `culturally specific' beliefs, because these were not elicited from mainstream population group. Nevertheless, to assess whether the beliefs we identified in this study are really `culturally specific', a cohort study with all significant beliefs for main ethnic groups in the GVA, including mainstream population, might be useful.
CONCLUSIONS The results of our study suggest that an effective antismoking campaign in the Chinese community should go beyond traditional English language efforts, utilise Chinese resources, and build on existing cultural attitudes (such as the belief that smoking is inappropriate for young people) and knowledge (such as health risks) about smoking. Particular attention should be paid to differences between female and male smokers and between younger and older smokers related to their knowledge, beliefs and attitudes about smoking, and perceived barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation. We also identified different beliefs and perceptions about the harms and benefits of smoking, based on language, age and gender group. The findings indicate the importance of addressing risk perceptions about the immediate and long-term consequences of smoking. Therefore, future interventions can prove the applicability of a risk perception model on smoking cessation among Mandarin and Cantonese speaking smokers. Despite finding significant differences between the genders, educational level, ethnicity and age groups in our study, we believe a larger sample size is needed to address this issue. The findings build a window of opportunity to promote tailored cessation interventions incorporating cultural beliefs, perceptions and practices for Chinese immigrant communities.
Practical implications Our study identified the health beliefs and perceptions about smoking and its cessation among Mandarin and Cantonese immigrants that could be considered by healthcare decision makers to develop health promotion

programmes preventing smoking onset among younger population groups in Chinese community. Interventions should take account of the specific profiles that Mandarin and Cantonese immigrants in terms of knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and perceptions on their smoking habits and patterns. Given the results of this study, we plan to conduct further research to assess the applicability of a risk perception model to the smoking behaviour of routine smokers in the target immigrant communities. The model has been shown effective in terms of modifying risk-taking behaviours, promoting positive perceptions, and improving self-efficacy that have been applied for changing smoking habits/behaviour.36-38

Art. Y.- An Experimental Inquiry into the Cause of the Ascent and Descent of the Sap, with some observations upon the Nutrition of Plants, and the Cause of Exosmose and Endosmose. By G. Rainey, m.it.c.s.e.j Demonstrator of Anatomy, and of Microscopic Anatomy, at Saint Thomas's Hospital. With Two Plates.?London, 1847, 12mo,
pp. 52.
This little treatise contains the results of numerous experimental inquiries and microscopic observations, which have been carried on for some time by its able author; and the perusal of it will suggest many new ideas to the vegetable physiologist. We are sorry that want of space prevents us from entering upon a more detailed critical examination of its contents ; particularly as Mr. Rainey's conclusions in regard to the course of the sap runs counter to the views which are commonly entertained on the subject. He considers that he has shown, " First, that the crude sap ascends along a tissue which chiefly exists between the cells, but which
enters also into the structure of the more solid and permanent parts of a plant; and, secondly, that the elaborated fluid, both in its descent and ascent, passes along the ducts and spiral vessels." The first of these
positions is based on the results of experiments on tlie absorption of a solution of bichloride of mercury. These results are not a little curious, and we have no doubt that they are most accurately stated ; but we do not see that they require, or even justify, the inferences founded upon them, opposed as these are by so many other reasonings, based on structural arrangements, as well as by actual observation of the process. We cannot understand what Mr. Rainey means by the ascent of elaborated sap, as distinguished from that of the crude sap, or by elaboration taking place in the roots. Every vegetable physiologist knows that in spring the ascending sap is charged with a considerable amount of gummy and saccharine matters, which it has derived from the starchy deposits laid up in the roots at the end of the previous season; but the presence of these does not seem to us to deprive the liquid of its character as " crude sapand the fact is unquestionable, that this liquid rises through the large open ducts which most woody stems possess. We believe that Mr. Rainey is perfectly justified in his assertion that the " spiral vessels" not unfrequently communicate with each other, and serve for the conveyance of fluid; but we
believe also, from our own observations, that the fact of non-communica-
tion is more common, and that the closed spiral vessels, at certain periods of their life, at least, contain air only. N We recommend Mr. Rainey's treatise to all who are interested in the inquiries of which it treats.

1. M. Charles Bonget's interesting researches on the anatomy of the female organs are summed in the following propositions :
1. In woman the body of the uterus presents the structure of an erectile organ, of a true corpus spongiosum.
2. That to the ovary also an erectile bulb is attached.
3. That in all the classes of vertebrata, and especially in all mammifera, a special muscular apparatus embraces the oviduct and ovary, and effects their adaptation to each other.
4. That the fasciculi of the ovario-tubal muscular membranes (mesoarium and mesometriuni) have such relations with the corpora spongiosa, and especially with their efferent sinuses, that, at the moment of contraction, the meshes of the network in the midst of which run the venous channels, contracting in every direction, these must necessarily be compressed, and the discharge of blood more or less completely stopped.
5. That the contraction of the ovario-tubal muscular apparatus persisting during the whole period of ovulation, the obstacle to the passage of blood and the erection of the corpora spongiosa of the uterus and ovary, which is the result, have the same duration.
6. That menstruation coinciding also, on the other hand, with ovulation, it
is natural to consider it as the immediate consequence of the erection of the
uterus; a true menstrual haemorrhage, moreover, never presenting itself but where the uterus possesses a truly erectile structure.
7. That if sexual excitation, as seems probable, can determine the erection of the uterus and ovary, it is easy to account by that fact for the coincidence of the periods of menstruation and ovulation.
2. Dr. Claude Bernard has communicated to the Societe de Biologie, of Paris, an account of some researches on the function of the placenta. He had some time before announced the presence of glucose in the amniotic fluid. In pursuing his researches into the origin of this substance, he found that the placenta of certain mammifera contains in the normal state a considerable quantity of glycogenic matter, lluminants alone seemed to offer an exception; but M. Bernard now finds that in these the glycogenic matter, instead of being met with in the placentas, has its productive organs in certain points of the amnios. The glycogenic matter of foetal age, whatever the species under examination, is formed by cellules, which in all their histological characters are exactly similar
to the cellules of the liver of adult animals. In the rodents these cellules are
formed between the foetal placenta and the maternal placenta. In ruminants, there are seen on the amnios whitish spots, which have either been completely

Eossible overlooked by observers, or taken for epithelial pathological productions. These
white spots are composed of agglomerations of cellules similar to the preceding. On microscopical examination of these spots, they are seen to be composed of a kind of papilla; filled with cells, and circumscribed by an amorphous membrane. Iodine gives a rose colour to the cellular contents. The layer of cells separating the foetal and maternal placentas in rodents, and the papillae containing the cells in ruminants, are developed from the earliest epoch of foetal life, ana immediately enter upon their functions. Like the hepatic cells in form, their function is similar?at least, as far as the production of glycogenic matter is concerned, for the author has not yet concluded his researches relative to the
secretion of bile by these organs. It is a true liver, absolutely unknown itherto. Whilst these organs are in function, the internal liver of the foetus is in a rudimentary state; its cells, perfectly embryonic, produce neither glycogenic matter nor glucose. Later they change their appearance, take gradually their normal shape and dimensions, and begin to secrete glycogenic matter. At the same time, the hepatic cells of the placenta or of the amnios become atrophied, and disappear.
3. M. Albert Pueck, house-surgeon to the Hotel Dieu at Toulon, makes an interesting communication on haemorrhages of the Fallopian tubes. He cites the following cases:
1st. A married woman was attacked with small-pox; when admitted into hospital she complained of acute pain in the lower part of the lumbar region and towards the sacrum, and this although she had menstruated a fortnight before. She rolled about in the bed screaming. Two days later, she was seized with profuse uterine haemorrhage, and died almost suddenly. On examination, the uterus was found full of clots; the mucous membrane was quite healthy, except at the fundus, where it was thickened, violet, infiltrated with blood; at this point a clot remained, which stretched into the left Fallopian tube. The tubes were of a violet aspect, of the size of the little finger, and filled with a large vermicular clot. There was not a drop of blood or serosity in the peritoneum. The right ovary presented no rupture, but had a clot the
size of a small walnut on its outer surface. The left ovary, of the size of a
lien's egg, was almost entirely converted into a sac containing a fatty matter and hairs. This case was reported by M. Laboulbene to the Societe de Biologie in 1853; the conclusion being that it was a case of haemorrhage of the Fallopian tubes.
The next case occurred under the observation of M. Pueck himself. A strong, robust woman, aged thirty-eight, was admitted on the 3rd of July, 1858, and died ten years after, of meningeal haemorrhage. The mucous membrane of the uterus was quite healthy; at the level of the left horn were some san-
guinolent mucosities, resembling those contained in the inner half of the corresponding tube. The right tube contained a white opaque mucus, it was fixed to the anterior surface of the ovary; two or three serous cysts the size of a pin's head were on the oviduct; the mucous membrane near the fimbriae was dull red, and pale elsewhere. The left tube was violet, as if ecchymosed ; its outer third was as large as the index finger; the fimbriated end was widely open, and connected with the ovary by a tubular membrane continued from it, forming a complete canal to the ovary. This portion was dilated by sanguinolent mucosities, and on pressure escaped from the uterine mouth of the tube; the mucous membrane was dark red, finely injected. There was no rupture of the ovary; but an apoplectic cavity in its substance. This the author considers to be a case of tubal haemorrhage, partly emptying itself into the uterus.
4. Dr. McClintock relates an important case in which an inverted uterus was removed by linear ecrasement. The patient, aged twenty-two, mother of one child, very anaemic, was admitted into the Dublin Lying-in Hospital in Sep-

552

[April,

tember, 1858. For twelve months she had suffered very profuse discharges of blood, always coming on at the menstrual periods, and lasting for fourteen or twenty-one days. A pediculated tumour, of pyriform shape, and of the size of a walnut, was found low in the vagina; the neck of this tumour was embraced, but not constricted, by the thin os uteri; it was quite insensible to ordinary manipulation; its surface was smooth, dark piuk, and discharged blood when scratched. The patient had been delivered after a protracted labour, by a rude country midwife, fourteen months before; the after-birth, she says, twice " slipped away" from the nurse, the cord being broken. The tumour being drawn down by a vulsellum, the os was entirely effaced, the vagina becoming quite continuous with the neck of the tumour. This led to the conclusion that the case was one of inverted uterus. Several attempts were made under chloroform to effect re-inversion, without success. On the 20th of October, a
silk ligature was passed round the neck of the uterus by Gooch's canula; this
caused much pain, and some vomiting. In the evening the ligature was tightened, and again on the next day. After forty-eight hours the ecraseur was applied below the ligature, the uterus having been drawn down by a vulsellum. The chain was worked very slowly, the uterus being severed in eight minutes. Pain attended the operation; and febrile excitement followed; opium was given, and turpentine epithems applied. In a fortnight the patient was allowed to get up. Six weeks afterwards, the os uteri presented almost the ordinary appearance; a catheter passed about one-third of an inch up the cervical canal. On the 27th of December, Dr. McClintock was informed that the patient was quite well, but had not menstruated.

II. Pregnancy.

On the Diagnosis of Pregnancy. By Professor Hecker. (Monatsschr. f. Geburtsk., Dec. 1858.)

Professor Hecker, of Marburg, has published the result of extensive investigations into the prognostic value of the penetrability to the finger of the os internum uteri in pregnancy. It is generally known that shortly before the
onset of labour the os uteri internum opens. Dr. Hecker has endeavoured to
give precision to the indications of this phenomenon. Since 1833, when he succeeded to the charge of the Marburg Lying-in Hospital, records have been kept of the date on which the os internum was ascertained to be open, and of the lapse from that event to labour. He of course points to the difficulty, that the time when the opening of the os internum was felt was not necessarily that when the os first opened; but he believes that the results of a large number of observations compensate for this source of error, although, since all the error is always on the same side, it is not easy to see how the multiplication of cases
can tend to its neutralization.

Dr. Hecker remarks that he has several times observed, in the case of women
who had walked a long distance to come to hospital, or who recently had undergone violent exertion, that the inner os uteri was penetrable on admission, but closed again after a few days rest.
His general results are as follows : Out of 2593 persons examined between 1833 and 1858, there were 946 in whom the inner os uteri was penetrable to the finger. Of these 916, 723 were pluriparaj and 223 primipara;. Of the 723 pluriparae,

366 were delivered within 7 days of ascertained penetrability.

1. The four cases of Dr. Pagenstecher illustrate various conditions which are held in Germany to be motives for resort to the Cocsarian section.

Case I.?Rupture of the uterus during labour, in a pelvis contracted from

osteomalacia; escape of the child into the abdominal cavity; Caesarian section.

?On the 9th November, ] 857, Dr. Pagenstecher was calied to a woman, aged

twenty-eight. She had borne a first child three years before, and had been

unable to move for four months after. During this second gestation, she had suf-

fered from pains in the bones of the pelvis and hips, and during the last three

months had been unable to walk or lie down, being reduced to sitting on the

edge of the bed. During stormy and painful contractions, repeated vomiting set

in,"after which the child's head, which had been before felt, suddenly disappeared,

and all pains ceased. Dr. Pagenstecher found the patient an hour and a half

after the catastrophe much prostrated, cold at the extremities, cold sweat on

the forehead, pulse imperceptible. The belly, very tender, was hanging over

the symphysis; below the navel he felt a hard round lump, filling both sides

of the abdomen; above this, to the left of the navel, a foot was made out. The

pelvis presented a strong curvature of the lumbar vertebra; forwards, and to the

right a considerable curvature of the sacrum, it being compresscd from above

downwards. The conjugate diameter was

inches, the symphysis was

pointed to the right, and the rami of the pubes formed two nearly parallel

lines, running to the tubera ischia. The tubera were scarcely two fingers'-

breadth across. The os uteVi could not be reached. When the abdomen

was incised, the uterus was seen pale and contracted in the lower half of the

wound, the right shoulder-blade of the child in the upper. The child ex-

tracted, much thick dark blood flowed from the abdomen. The incised wound

yielded hardly any blood. There seems to have been no reaction. Death

followed twenty-six hours after tlie operation. On dissection, numerous coagula were found in the peritoneal sac, but no peritoneal exudations. The uterus was tolerably thick and contracted at its fundus, and very distended and thin below. Its posterior wall was rent in an oblique direction, from the os uteri to the insertion of the right broad ligament. The fist could be passed through the wound, and onwards into the vagina through the open os uteri. The walls of the uterus at fundus were pale, but sound and thick; the lower parts, and especially around the rent, were discoloured, very soft and thin. i)r. Pagenstacher is unwilling to declare that the uterine walls were in a diseased state prior to the rupture. He thinks that possibly the long pressure of the uterus against the projecting point of thepubes, and the sharp ridge of the last lumbar vertebra, favoured the rupture.
Case II.?Caesarian section in contracted pelvis from osteomalacia.?A woman, aged forty, had borne eight children, the last four dead. Labours tedious, with forceps. Since the second pregnancy she has suffered from pains in the "bones, and can only walk with difficulty. Labour began on the 2nd of December, 1857. The external conjugate diameter measured six inches. The symphysis was strongly beak-shaped, and the pubic arch, down to the tubera, so squeezed up, that these were scarcely an inch apart. The pubic arch assumed the shape of a key-hole. The promontory was easily felt by the finger. The foetal heart was distinctly heard. The Caesarian section was performed under chloroform. The incision had to be extended upwards above the navel, on account of the rising of the bladder so high above the pelvis. The extraction of the child was rendered difficult by the extremely energetic contraction of the uterus. The placenta had to be detached from a strong adhesion to the anterior wall. This occasioned great hsemorrhape both during the operation and in the following hours, when contractile pains entirely ceased. The child lived. The after-treatment consisted in small draughts of cold water and cold compresses ; one-quarter grain doses of morphia every three hours. Pains
and distention of the abdomen continued for next four days, then a discharge of thick coagulated blood. At the end of the first week a normal lochial flow. The sutures were removed on the seventh and eighth days. At the end of the second week peritoneal symptoms appeared, with vomiting and constipation, and painful distention of the belly. Small doses of opium with castor-oil, and lavements, allayed these conditions, and in four weeks' time the patient was fully restored. The child lived.
Case III.?Ca;sarian section in contraction of pelvis from rachitis.? Primipara, aged thirty-seven; 8th March, 1858. The patient is scarcely three feet and a half high; her skull was very flat and low, with very angular parietal bones. Labour began last night; the water flowed about midnight; the child was alive. The conjugate diameter was estimated at two inches and a quarter ; the pelvic outlet very narrow. The head, with large caput succedaneum, presented. The patient was narcotized, and an incision carried from the navel to two fingers'-breadth above the pubes; this was afterwards extended above the navel. The peritoneum opened, the very fat and cedematous omentum lay behind the abdominal wall. This was pushed aside, and the uterus was opened. On account of the incomplete anaesthesia and the restlessness of the patient, the protrusion of some folds of intestine could not be prevented. The left shoulder presented first; the left arm, then the right, were freed, when the breech was brought forward, and the child delivered by the legs. It was very cyanotic; it breathed, however, after a slight loss of blood and cold aspersions. The placenta lay below and to the right; it was removed without difficulty. Free bleeding of the Uterus was stilled by ice. The wound was brought together, a small plug inserted at the lower angle, the belly properly supported, and an ice-bladder applied for twenty-four hours.

Internally, morphia and ice. The sutnres were removed on the sixth day; the entire wound healed by the first intention, with the exception of a small spot. The patient was quite well in the third week, suckling her child.
Case IV.?Casarian section in pelvic contraction from osteomalacia, performed for the second time on the same woman.?On the 28th March, 1858, a_ married woman, whom Dr. Pagenstecher had delivered by Caesarian section in 1852, came again under his care. In the first year the patient had suffered frequent relapses of osteomalacia, and was now in a state of marked marasmus. With extreme muscular atrophy, the abdomen had undergone an enormous development, reaching to the knees; and its walls, thin as paper, were necrosed in. several places. Tor months the patient could neither walk nor stand; the pelvic bones were in the highest degree painful, much thinned, and the diameter, as far as could be determined, considerably narrowed. Labour began with strong pains in the morning; at six p.m., when seen, the pains had ceased, and
with them the foetal movements. The foetal heart could not be heard. The incision was carried to the middle of the abdomen. The transparent
uterus was exposed and opened. It had, notwithstanding the extreme thinning of its walls, maintained the compression of the pains; the membranes protruded uninjured ; they were much thicker than the uterine walls. It was ascertained that the placenta was fully detached, so that the intra-uterine labour was completed. The removal of the dead child and placenta followed without trouble, and the uterus contracted into a hard fist-sized ball. The abdominal wound was united; the haemorrhage was very violent; morphia and ice-bladder were unable to allay it. The belly became distended, so that on the next day it had attained the same size as before delivery. Vomiting set in, and death followed eighty hours after the operation.

2. Case I.?A woman, aged twenty-nine, with short and crooked legs, had been delivered in her first pregnancy of a dead premature child; in her second pregnancy, of a child at full term by craniotomy; in her third pregnancy, of a dead child in the eighth month, also by art. Her fourth pregnancy seemed at an end on the 9th of July. The sacrum was much curved, the promontory easily reached. The conjugate diameter was two inches and a half. Caesarian section performed. The details are not related, but the patient is reported to have completely recovered.
Case II.?A primipara, aged twenty-one, was in labour. The promontory
projected greatly; the upper pelvic strait was narrowed to a fissure two
inches across. The abdominal incision was made a little to the side of the
linea alba, on account of the lateral position of the uterus. There was little loss of blood; the uterus contracted well. Slight unpleasant symptoms were removed by morphia. In the eighth week complete recovery.
In neither case is the fate of the child recorded.

3. Dr. Hennig has made an analysis of a number of cases of cephalotripsy, with the view of comparing the results of this operation with those of perforation. The cases are arranged in three series : 1st, Those in which the mother
recovered; 2ndlv, Those in which the mother's life was saved, but the structures injured ; 3rdly, Those in which the mother died. 64 cases are collected; of these 41 mothers recovered completely, 6 imperfectly, and 12 died. The result of the remainder is unknown. [The detailed examination of the cases is not decisive in favour of the operation. The collection, like most others of the kind, is worthless as an element of statistical comparison. Some of the opera-
tions were performed in hospitals, and the deaths might be, at least in part, ascribed to puerperal fever ; and other circumstances vary, especially the indications taken by different physicians to call for the operation. Thus one case

556

[April,

is quoted from Dr. Crede in which this physician waited three hours in order to let the child die. It is quite clear that no trustworthy comparison can be made between the results of operations performed on the Continent and in hospitals, and of operations performed in this country.?Rep.]

4. The obstetrical history of a woman in twelve labours, related by Dr. Perrin, is of extreme interest, as showing two points?1st, The presumed increasing pelvic contraction; 2ndly, The application of turning to delivery as a substitute for craniotomy. The first seven labours passed without remarkable difficulty; the seventh, however, required the forceps. The children were all living, and some of them showed symptoms of rickets during infancy. In the remaining five labours none of the children survived. In the eighth labour the head remained at the brim without being able to enter, from projection of the sacral promontory. The forceps failed, and turning was performed; the head was at length disengaged by the forceps. The child's heart was beating, but it never breathed. In her ninth pregnancy, the proposition to induce labour at seven months was not carried out. The feet presented; extraction was effected; but the child, born asphyxiated, did not breathe. In the tenth labour the head was lying on the brim. Turning was effected, and the head was extracted by forceps. The child's heart pulsated, but it never breathed. In her eleventh labour, by version alone, without forceps, a still
child of average size was delivered. In the twelfth and last labour the head
lay again at the brim ; child was alive. Turning was quickly effected immediately after rupturing the membranes. The diminution of the antero-posterior diameter, caused by the projection of the promontory, arrested the entry of the head until after long and laborious efforts of two accoucheurs, who were successively tired out. The child was very large and still-born.
It is highly probable that in this country several of the latter children would have been delivered by craniotomy. It may be said that under the method pursued the children equally died; but it may be urged that a revolting operation was avoided, and that the children had a chance of life.

5. Dr. Mattei has introduced anew form of forceps, which, from its assumed gentle action, he calls the leniceps. The instrument consists of two similar
blades, having the single cranial curve, which nearly accurately fits the cra-
nium. The curve is therefore great. The blades do not lock, but fit iuto a
bar of wood having several notches to admit the stalks at various distances. The blades and stalks are very short. Amongst the advantages claimed are that its moderate size enables the accoucheur to use it without the knowledge of the patient; that the blades being more curved, the tissues of the mother are less liable to dragging; that the head cannot be exposed to compression;
that it does not require an assistant to help in the introduction. It may be observed that all these objects, except the first, which is not to be commended, are accomplished by properly-constructed forceps, which are moreover capable
of effecting what the leniceps cannot do?namely, the bringing a head through a narrow pelvic brim. In the latter case some amount of compression by' the forceps is necessary, and may be safely employed.

G. Dr. Martin relates five cases in support of the proposition that inflamma-

tion of the Fallopian tubes and discharge of the purulent secretion into the

abdominal cavity is a cause '

of

puerperal

peritonitis.

He refers to a passage

in Cruveilhier's Anatomic Pathologique,' in which that admirable pathologist

suggested this explanation of some cases of peritonitis. It is right to re-

produce this passage:

"The presence of pus in the Fallopian tube being an extremely frequent

phenomenon in peritonitis, I have asked myself if it were not possible that

1859.]

peritonitis was in some cases the result of the passage of pus from the cavity of the tube into the cavity of the peritoneum; if capillary attraction or vital suction be exerted in the act of conception upon the spermatic fluid by the Fallopian tube, might not it be exerted as well upon the pus or any other liquid contained in the cavity of the uterus ?"
It is desirable to give briefly the cases of Dr. Martin, so as to expose the evidence upon which his proposition is based.
Case I.?A primipara, aged "twenty-two, delivered in the Jena Lying-in Hospital on the 8th April, 1839, after a natural labour, of a strong living child. She felt a " chill" a short time afterwards. Suddenly, on the 2nd May, pain set in in the left abdomen; on the 3rd May, this was more intense, and fever was added; on the 6th, diarrhoea and delirium ; on the 7th, death. The treatment consisted of twelve leeches applied on two occasions during the first days; castor-oil, opium, camphor, and ipecacuanha.
Autopsy.?A sero-pumlent effusion in the lower part of the abdominal cavity; the omentum was glued to the peritoneum in front by puriform gelatinous masses. The uterus and lower intestinal convolutions were also covered with purulent exudations. The uterus was of the size of a large fist; the left tube was considerably enlarged in its outer third, and filled with purulent mucus; the fimbria; were swollen. The right tube had also swollen fimbria, but its canal was not enlarged. The substance of the uterus was pale, normal, the inner surface reddened and covered with purple blood; there was a muco-purulent discharge at the placental seat. (It is not stated at what part of the uterus the placenta had been seated.)

Case II.?A primipara, aged thirty-three, was delivered in the Jena Lying-in Hospital on the 5tli November, 1853, of a living child, after a natural labour. On the evening of the Oth, there was tenderness in the right side of the abdomen, and fever; ten leechcs were applied. On the 7th, there was an offensive discharge. On the 9th, general symptoms worse; hurried breathing with bronchial secretion, diarrhoea, headache. On the 10th, death.
Autopsy.?The uterus rose above the promontory of the sacrum; its muscular structure was anaemic, containing no pus; its cavity, especially at the placental seat at the left angle, was covered with a grey-red pulpy mass, entangling shreds of vessels and plugs of blood; the cervical canal was filled with sanguinolent purulent fluid. At the abdominal extremity of both tubes was a purulent exudation, which was continued throughout the entire mucous membrane; the right tube was much enlarged, the mucous membrane loosened and partly covered with a yellow, purulent secretion; the right ovary was united to the posterior wall of the uterus and the rectum; the left tube was affected in a lesser degree.

- Case III.?A primipara, aged twenty-five, was delivered in the hospital on the 12th July, 1851, after a tedious labour, of_a living girl. In the night she felt suddenly severe pain in the abdomen, which increased; the belly became distended, hot, and acutely painful on moving; ten leeches applied; calomel and opium. Death early on the lltli.
Autopsy.?The abdominal cavity held a brownish flocculent pus. The lymphatic vessels of either side along the spermatic veins were much distended; the lymphatic glands enlarged ; the larger lymphatic vessels contained pus and small purulent foci. The uterus was strongly contracted; muscular substance pale; vessels empty ; the placental seat was on the anterior wall, two inches above the inner os uteri; the remaining part of the inner surface was uniformly reddened, without traces of exudation or suppuration. The tubes, especially the left, were much enlarged; the vessels of the fimbriae injectcd; the mucous membrane loosened, thick, and covered at the outer end with a creamy secre-

tion. On the left ovary and t.nbe the veins -were distended, and the lymphatic
vessels 'were fdled with whitish fluid.
Case IV.?A primipara, aged twenty-five, was delivered in the Jena Hospital on the 19t.li November, 1857, of a living boy. In the afternoon of the following day, she had pain in the abdomen, and took ten grains of calomel, and on the 2J st, ten grains more. Several stools folio-wed the last dose. On the 22nd, the symptoms had remitted. On the 23rd, however, when seemingly quite well, she got out of bed, and being surprised, leaped suddenly back again. Shortly after this, shivering and acute pain in the abdomen came on. On the 24th, the pain was especially severe in the right side. Twelve leeches applied. On the 25th, the abdomen was distended; everything was worse; twelve more leechcs applied. Bronchitis, tympanitis appeared, and death
ensued on the 27th.
Autopsy.?A large quantity of bloody purulent exudation flowed from the abdomen when opened. The omentum, where glued to the right iliac fossa, was inflamed. The ovaries were covered with exudation; both tubes at their outer extremities much distended with purulent contents. The inner surfacc
of uterus showed remains of endometritis.
Case Y.?A primipara, aged twenty-nine, was delivered in the Jena Hospital of a living boy?labour natural?on the 26th May, 1858. She was quite well for the first week, excepting that the locliial discharge was profuse and offensive. On the 3rd June the abdomen was painful, and she had three stools. During the 4th and 5th, the diarrhoea continued ; she took an infusion of ipecacuanha with acetate of ammonia. On the 6th, the diarrhoea had ceased, and the patient got up to dress; while stooping for this purpose she was suddenly seized with an acute pain in the abdomen, which increased from hour to hour; the severest pain was in the right side. It was concluded that this sudden pain was caused by the escape of pus from the Fallopian tube, brought about by the sudden compression of the abdomen in stooping. Ten leeches applied. Tympanitis, delirium, and collapse followed, and death on the 10th.
Autopsy.?A considerable quantity of purulent exudation was found, espe-
cially in the right half of the abdomen, and the principal focus was seated in the right iliac fossa. There was pus in the cavity of the uterus, but no pus in the vessels or muscular wall. The right tube was much dilated, and contained a considerable collection of pus. The left tube was quite normal.
Dr. Martin insists upon the necessity of keeping women who exhibit any symptoms of metritis perfectly quiescent, so as to favour one of the terminations of tubal inflammation, which is closure of the fimbriated extremity. Professor Yirehow, in some observations upon this paper, said it was a very difficult matter to determine the starting-point of a peritonitis. Every inflammation of the abdomen, no matter how arising, had by the law of gravity a tendency to involve the pelvic organs. Thus in perforation of the stomach or processus vermiformis, inflammations of the tubes and ovaries occurred as much as in primitive disease of these organs. The clearing-up of this question did not rest with anatomy, but with clinical observation.
(The llcporter would remark that all the cases occurred in hospital, and that no history is given of the sanitary condition of the institution. If puerperal fever?especially that form arising from hospital air?be the consequence of a blood-poison, the theory here set forth of a fatal peritonitis caused by the accidental escape of a little pus from a localized inflammation of the Fallopian tube, does not appear sufficiently proved.)

Comparative Transcriptional Analysis of Patient Responders Versus Non-Responders to Glucocorticoid Treatment for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Victoria J. Shi, BA/MD Candidate1, Suban Burale, BS1, Tamorah Lewis, MD, PhD2, Neerupma Silswal, PhD1, Paula Monaghan-Nichols, PhD1. 1University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, Kansas City, MO, USA, 2Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, MO, USA.
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a common heterogeneous lung disease that can result from preterm birth at less than 28-weeks gestation, prenatal and postnatal inflammatory insults, ventilator associated lung injury, and oxygen-related injury. Synthetic glucocorticoids (sGCs) are commonly used pre- and postnatally to treat inflammation and improve lung physiology. Clinical responses to sGC therapy for BPD vary in patients. We hypothesize that genetic background differences in transcriptional response to sGC therapy dictate the efficacy in infants with BPD. Identifying pathways and genes that mediate these differences will allow prospective determination of which infants would respond to sGC treatment. 26 preterm infants that received sGC treatment for BPD were identified. Respiratory Severity Score (RSS), an indication of BPD severity, was measured at diagnosis, 4 days, and 7 days post-sGC treatment. Patients were stratified into Responders versus Non-Responders by improvement in respiratory function after treatment. Changes in RSS were used to discriminate Responders (R >3 decrease in RSS) to treatment from Non-Responders (NR <3 decrease). 13 Responders and 13 Non-Responders were selected. They included 7 females and 19 males with an average gestational age of 24.3 weeks, and were 46% Caucasian, 31% African American, 19% Hispanic, and 4% other. 100µL of blood was collected before and after seven days of a dexamethasone treatment course. To examine differences in transcription response between Responders (n = 13) and Non-Responders (n= 13), RNA was isolated and analyzed using the Clariom S Human Transcriptome Affymetrix array. 21,500 expressed genes were profiled. Results: were imported into the Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC) software, and genes with a significant difference (fold change >1.48 or < -1.48 and p-value <0.05) in Responders and Non-Responders were identified. Of those, 133 genes were upregulated and 74 downregulated. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to identify signaling pathways and disease processes that were uniquely altered in Responders versus NonResponders. Non-Responders showed significant activation of neuroinflammatory signaling pathways, degranulation pathways, and lymphocyte activation disease pathways. Target genes in the top dysregulated pathways were evaluated using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). Expression changes in Matrix Metalloproteinase-25, Interleukin-12 Receptor beta, and Microsomal Glutathione Transferase-1, key mediators of inflammation, were validated in independent studies using qPCR. While response to systemic glucocorticoids in neonates with BPD is variable, these studies identified pathways that are altered in Responders versus Non-Responders and are a step

towards developing pre-screening tools to stratify infants for response to sGC BPD therapy.

Concomitant Pheochromocytoma and Primary Aldosteronism: A Case Series and Literature Review Jimmy J. Mao, MD1, Jessica Baker, BA2, William E. Rainey, MS PhD2, William F. Young, MD, MSc1, Irina Bancos, MD1. 1Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA, 2University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.
Objective: The detection and management of concomitant pheochromocytoma (PHEO) and primary aldosteronism (PA) is not well understood. Our objectives were to investigate varying presentations and outcomes of cases with coexisting PHEO and PA to provide an approach to its diagnosis and management. Design: Retrospective case series from 2000-2020 at a single institution tertiary center; additional review of previously known cases before 2000 and from the medical literature. Patients and Measurements: Adult patients with concomitant PHEO and PA. Clinical, biochemical, radiologic, and histologic parameters were reviewed. Results: Fifteen patients (53% men, median age 53 years) were diagnosed with concomitant PHEO and PA. The majority presented with hypertension (13, 87%) and hypokalemia (13, 87%), but only 6 (40%) presented with symptoms suggestive of catecholamine excess. All patients with preoperative work-up for catecholamine excess (14, 93%) were found to have elevated plasma or urinary metanephrines/catecholamines above the upper limit of normal. Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) was performed in 9 (60%) patients, where 5 (56%) were diagnosed with bilateral PA, and 4 (44%) with unilateral PA. All patients underwent either unilateral (12, 80%) or bilateral (3, 20%) adrenalectomy to treat their PHEO and/or PA. Postoperative catecholamines and/ or catecholamine breakdown products normalized or improved in 13 (87%) patients and were not measured in 2. Recurrence of PHEO was not observed. Six (40%) displayed persistent PA postoperatively, where 4 required long-term mineralocorticoid blockade. Conclusions: Concomitant PHEO and PA is a rare but likely underreported condition. Hypertension with or without hypokalemia should prompt evaluation for PA, while any indeterminate adrenal mass should be worked up for PHEO. Coexisting disease warrants consideration of AVS to determine the laterality of PA to ensure appropriate management.

Background: Secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI) can develop following unilateral adrenalectomy (UA) foradrenaldependent hypercortisolism (HC) and has been reported after UA for primaryaldosteronism (PA). An institutional study previously demonstrated that cosyntropin stimulationtesting on postoperative day 1 (POD1-CST) successfully identified patients who requiredglucocorticoid replacement (GR) following UA; 50% of HC patients required GR and no PApatients required GR. The aim of this study was to reevaluate the need for GR following UA forpatients with HC and PA in a larger cohort of patients. Methods We reviewed 108 patients from a prospectively maintained adrenal database who underwent UAfor HC (n=74), PA (n=22), and concurrent HC/PA (n=12) from 9/2014-10/2020. PA patientswithout preoperative evaluation for HC were excluded. Patients with 1mg dexamethasonesuppression test (DST) cortisol >1.8 (µg/dL) were defined as having mild HC, with ³5 defined asovert Cushing's Syndrome (CS). All patients underwent our institutional POD1-CST protocoland GR was initiated for patients with basal cortisol £5 or stimulated cortisol £14 (<18 prior to4/2017). Results: Overall, 51 (47%) patients had an abnormal POD1-CST and were discharged on GR (44 HC, 1PA, and 6 HC/PA). Two (2%) patients with CS had a normal POD1-CST but developed AIrequiring GR at 8 and 12 weeks post UA. Of the 74 patients with HC, 44 (59%) had an abnormalPOD1-CST and were discharged on GR, including 19/28 (68%) with CS and 25/46 (54%) withmild HC. Preoperative DST cortisol was higher in HC patients who required GR compared topatients with a normal POD1-CST (4.1 vs 3.6; p=0.007). Median cortisol levels for HC patientswith an abnormal POD1-CST vs those with a normal test were: basal: 3.8 vs 15.6 (p=0.027); 30-minute: 10.1 vs 20.1 (p=0.403); and 60-minute 11.4 vs 22.2 (p=0.260). Of the 22 PA patients, 19(86%) had a normal POD1-CST. Median cortisol levels for PA patients with an abnormal POD1-CST vs those with a normal test were: basal: 0.4 vs 12.1; 30-minute: 8.8 vs 24.6; and 60-minute:12.2 vs 28.9. Of the 3 (14%) PA patients with an abnormal POD1-CST, 1 was dischargedwith GR and began tapering after 2 weeks; the other 2 did not require GR and did not developAI. Of the 12 patients with combined PA/HC, 6 (50%) were discharged on GR based on POD1-CST. GR was required by 30 (59%) patients for <3 months and 82% for <12 months; 7/9 whorequired GR >12 months had CS. Conclusions: Using a standard protocol for POD1-CST in patients who underwent unilateral adrenalectomyfor HC, PA, or combined PA/HC, this study demonstrated that routine GR is not required in 32%of patients with CS and 46% of patients with mild HC. POD1CST safely identifies patients whowill require GR with no immediate concern for adrenal insufficiency. These data also suggestthat routine evaluation for AI in postoperative PA patients is not needed if cortisol excess hasbeen excluded preoperatively.

Introduction: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major cause of cardiovascular disease including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which is characterized by left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD). It is reported that Cushing's syndrome is also associated with LVDD. The relationship between plasma cortisol concentration and LVDD, however, has not been investigated in patients with DM. Methods: In this study, 109 patients with DM and 104 patients with non-DM without overt heart failure were enrolled. Left ventricular function were assessed using echocardiography. The ratio of early diastolic velocity (E) from transmitral inflow to early diastolic velocity (e') of tissue Doppler at mitral annulus (E/e') was used as an index of diastolic function. Parameters of plasma cortisol concentration, glycemic control, lipid profile, treatment with anti-diabetic drugs and other clinical characteristics were evaluated, and their association with E/e' determined. Patients taking steroids, undergoing dialysis treatment and with overt heart failure were excluded. Results: Univariate analysis showed that E/e' was significantly correlated with age (p<0.001), duration of diabetes (p=0.039), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p<0.001), eGFR (p=0.002), sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor use (p<0.001) and cortisol (p=0.009) in patients with DM. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that log E/e' was positively correlated with age (p=0.018), log SBP (p= 0.005), eGFR (p=0.015), cortisol (p=0.028) and that log E/e' was inversely with inhibitor use (p=0.018). There was no association between E/e' and cortisol in patients with non-DM. Conclusions: Cortisol may be important in the development of LVDD in patients with DM.

If life were created by intelligent design, we would indeed age from accumulation of molecular damage. Repair is costly and limited by energetic resources, and we would allocate resources rationally. But, albeit elegant, this design is fictional. Instead, nature blindly selects for short-term benefits of robust developmental growth. "Quasiprogrammed" by the blind watchmaker, aging is a wasteful and aimless continuation of developmental growth, driven by nutrient-sensing, growthpromoting signaling pathways such as MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin). A continuous post-developmental activity of such gerogenic pathways leads to hyperfunctions (aging), loss of homeostasis, age-related diseases, nonrandom organ damage and death. This model is consistent with a view that (1) soma is disposable, (2) aging and menopause are not programmed and (3) accumulation of random molecular damage is not a cause of aging as we know it.

The View from Intelligent Design
DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, as well as structures containing these molecules can be damaged. Molecular damage constantly occurs. This must lead to aging. Molecular damage can be repaired. Yet, repair is energy-dependent and "expensive." And the organism, anyway, does not last forever, because it dies from extrinsic causes, such as predators, infections, starvation and accidents. Resource must be allocated: first to vital functions (such as brain respiration) to avoid immediate death, second to growth and reproduction and, third, to repair molecular damage to avoid "aging." And a truly intelligent designer will even calculate cost-effectiveness of anti-aging repair and design trade-off allocation between repair and reproduction to maximize reproductive success.
In the protected environment, where accidental causes of death are diminished, humans and laboratory/domesticated animals would die from aging (see Footnote 1).

Figure 1. MTOR-driven quasi-programmed aging: plenty of food (overeating) vs. calorie restriction (famine). (A) Plenty of food: activation of the nutrient/MTOR and insulin/MTOR pathway. Calories are used for survival, growth and reproduction (R). Energy-dependent program of developmental growth continues as energy-dependent quasi-program of aging. N (natural), the typical lifespan in the wild; P (protected environment), the typical lifespan in the protected environment (humans, laboratory and domestic animals). In rare cases, protected environments can emerge naturally, especially among large animals. (B) Calorie restriction and famine: Especially during famine, calories/nutrients are used for immediate survival and only "leftovers" for program of developmental growth and reproduction (growth/R). N (natural), the typical lifespan in the wild during famine is short. There is no need to spend any calorie on anti-aging activities, no need to delay aging. P (protected environment), the typical lifespan in the protected environment (humans, laboratory and domestic animals). Lifespan is increased during calorie restriction under protected environment (ideally, no accidental death), exactly because resources are limited to drive energy-dependent quasi-programmed aging.

Blind Watchmaker
Unlike intelligent designer (ID), blind watchmaker (BW) cannot foresee aging. The BW is concerned with development, growth, reproduction and prevention of death from immediate causes: starvation, accidents, predators, weather, genetic and infectious diseases. Early in life, an animal must be strong and competitive. Activated by nutrients and growth factors, intracellular signaling networks including the MTOR (target of rapamycin) pathway stimulate growth,2,3 muscle hypertrophy4 and robustness.5 Provided that nutrients (fuel) are readily available, MTOR is active or, metaphorically, "MoTOR" is running (Fig. 1A).
Because BW cannot design, she is extremely wasteful and messy. But even a small increase in fitness early in life justifies any waste. Furthermore, when development is finished, BW continues to spend energy on "twisted" growth or aging, which is purely harmful, energyconsuming and an unneeded process. But nature is blind. So how does growth convert into aging?
When developmental growth is completed, BW does not care to switch off

growth programs driven by MTOR (and other related pathways). What for? Furthermore, MTOR is positively involved in reproduction. Also, the organism is likely to die from extrinsic causes anyway (Fig. 1). So nature is incapable of inhibiting MTOR just to prevent "future" aging. A hypothetical exception was discussed elsewhere.6,7 One can calculate the cost-effect, but not because anti-aging efforts are limited by resources, but because MTOR is pleiotropic: useful early in life and harmful later. Later in life, MTOR causes cellular aging with inappropriate hyperfunction, an increased production of cytokines, resistance to signals, leading to loss of homeostasis, diseases of aging, organ damage and death, as recently discussed.6
BW is reluctant to constrain mTOR just in order to delay "aging." Survive right now is more important. The M(o)TOR is running, and the accelerator is stuck. By analogy, a car, running at 75 mph on the

For example, RNA/protein synthesis is decreased with aging in model organisms, yet its further inhibition prolongs lifespan,8-13 indicating insufficient natural decrease

highway exits to a parking lot but continues to idle at full speed, as the accelerator is stuck. Importantly, even 50 mph will be too fast (see Footnote 2).
It is not BW, but starvation, scarce resources and stresses that de-activate the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway, simply for mechanistic reasons not for the purpose of slowing aging. Starvation slows developmental growth, delays reproduction and aging (Fig. 1A), because aging is just driven by the same M(o)TOR, and this is why CR extends lifespan and overeating shortens it14 (Fig. 1).
Both Models are Disposable Soma Theories (DST)
Soma is disposable by definition. Therefore, regardless of the mechanisms of aging, all models of aging are "disposable soma theories." For example, soma could be damaged by passive process, such as insufficient repair of molecular damage. As emphasized, "the aging process is caused by the gradual buildup of a huge number of individually tiny faults--some damage to a DNA strand here, a deranged protein molecule there and so on."15 Or it can be damaged by an active process: myocardial infarction and stroke as a consequence of atherosclerosis, hypertension and thrombosis caused by MTOR-driven aging.6,16
It is misleading to call any one theory "simply" disposable soma theory (DST), implying that other theories are not DSTs.
DST One: Damage/Repair Theory
Known as "disposable soma theory (DST)," this theory postulates that: (1) accumulation of molecular damage causes aging, and (2) repair is costly and limited by resources.15,17,18 Therefore, molecular damage is not repaired completely and eventually causes aging (in a protected environment). This is logical and intelligent. Actually, this is exactly what an intelligent designer would design. However, predictions of this model contradict observations, experiments and medical practice. If repair is limited by resources, the prediction must be the less resources, the shorter lifespan. And

vice versa, namely, over-nutrition would provide resources for repair and thereby extend lifespan. However, calorie restriction extends lifespan, whereas overeating shortens it.
To save the theory, it was suggested that during famine/starvation resources are allocated to anti-aging repair (Fig. 1). When starvation is over, then an organism would live a longer life, catching up with reproduction. This is paradoxical.14,19 First, during famine, when the death rate is especially high, it would be sensible to allocate resources to vital functions and fitness, simply to prevent death from starvation and predators. Is it aging that always limits lifespan in the wild according to DST (and even despite famine when external death rate is exceptionally high). This contradicts the evolutionary theory. The DST (repair/damage) theory becomes internally inconsistent, leading to paradoxes as discussed.14 It was even suggested that some harmful conditions such as menopause are programmed and have a purpose.15 And would any rational designer extend life by inflicting damage (hormesis), indicating lack of design, as recently discussed?20 And finally, deletion of numerous genes and processes not only improves an organism, but also extends lifespan.21-36 What is a strange design? Should knockout of springs make clock-watches better? One must agree with Richard Dawkins that an intelligent designer (ID) has never existed. Aging, like life itself, have been shaped by blind watchmaker (BW).
DST Two: Hyperfunction Theory
In the BW scenario, an organism actively causes aging. BW uses energy to foster growth and then for its unneeded continuation, quasi-programmed aging. The long sequence of unforeseen events includes cellular hypertrophy, hyperplasia, hyperfunctions, loss of homeostasis, agerelated diseases, organ damage and loss of functions.37,38 At late stages, the process becomes MTOR-independent. Then malfunctions replace hyperfunctions. Since initial hyperfunctions are the most harmful, the model MTOR-driven quasiprogrammed aging is becoming known as hyperfunction theory.39

Life without Food: Eating as Harmful Quasi-Programmed
Hyperfunction
The most impressive example is lifespan extension by complete removal of food in C. elegans.40 Whereas nutrients are essential for developmental growth, they are not needed in adult C. elegans, but even hurt them. Still, harmful eating continues. As was discussed in detail, nutrients, insulin and growth factors all activate TOR, driving growth and aging.41 This explains why lack of food extends lifespan. This cannot be easily explained by any trade-offs between maintenance and reproduction.40 The higher the MTOR activity, the faster the aging the way it is blindly "designed." An adult worm is actively seeking food, thus only accelerating its aging and death.
Gerogenic Conversion (Cellular Aging) and Organismal Aging
One of the most important features of hyperfunction theory is that organismal aging and age-related diseases can be easily explained by cellular aging on molecular mechanisms.38,42,43 Cellular senescence is not just cell cycle arrest.44 Senescence is not even necessarily cell cycle arrest (see Footnote 3). Cellular senescence develops when signal-transduction pathways, which drive metabolism and mass/size growth (nutrient-sensing, oncogenic, growth-promoting pathway, insulin/ mitogen-sensing, gerogenic pathways), are activated, but the cell cycle is nevertheless blocked. Then the cell undergoes MTORdriven geroconversion or conversion from quiescence/arrest to senescence.45-59 Such
3 The difference between cell cycle arrest and senescence is unfortunately misunderstood. In the young organism, most cells are arrested but not senescent. They become senescent via gerogenic conversion. In cell culture, cell cycle arrest is a predisposition to senescence. Cell cycle arrest itself does not cause senescence but creates conditions for geroconversion from arrest to senescence.44 MTOR generally causes growth and fosters proliferation, whereas rapamycin slows cell cycle progression and of course does not induce proliferation in the arrested cells.44 What rapamycin and other inhibitors of MTOR do is suppress geroconversion (gerosuppression). Inhibitors of MTOR suppress some markers of senescent phenotype and preserve proliferative/regenerative (PP) potential, which is convenient to measure senescence. The potential to proliferate is not proliferation. This is the potential of normal young cell.

gerogenic cells drive age-related diseases and organism aging.38,60 Because rapamycin suppresses cellular geroconversion, the gerosuppressant rapamycin also suppresses age-related diseases and aging (See ref. 61 for review and references therein as well as most recent publications). Interestingly rapamycin can also affect not only geroconversion (physiological aging) but also so-called chronological aging in yeast62 and cancer cells,63 or in other words, acidinduced cell destruction.63-65 Even more intriguingly, rapamycin can prevent replicative aging in certain conditions.55,66-68 Most importantly, it can treat age-related diseases and69-74 extend lifespan in old75 and cancer-prone mice,76 including mice lacking p5377-80 and RB,81 and slow down the aging process.82,83
Why Damage Cannot Cause Aging, as We Know It
Unlike pleotropic MTOR, which is useful early in life, random damage is harmful at any stage of life. Blind watchmaker is especially prone to overdo any necessary task for short-termed benefits. BW repairs it because it is harmful right now, not because BW is concerned with aging later. Broken bone needs to be repaired to save infant life. Molecular damage needs to be repaired too. Or consider progeria,84-87 including Hutchinson-Gilford progeria (HGP) syndrome.88 Infants and children with this syndrome would not be viable in the wild. They would die at a very young age. By a remarkable co-incidence, progeria in animals can be treated by rapamycin.89-91
So BW takes damage repair seriously: damage must be repaired regardless of aging, and this is why it is not a cause of aging. In addition, mutations initiate a sequence of events leading to cancer. Not despite but because of high mutation rate, cancer cells are robust (not weak), and multiple rounds of selection and proliferation non-randomly activate the MTOR pathway in cancer cells (for details, see ref. 92). Finally, BW may blindly repair some rare beneficial mutations too.
But still, damage accumulates. In theory, it will cause a new type of aging (at age of 130, for instance) if MTORdriven quasi-programmed aging would

not terminate life first. By analogy, when in the past people died young from starvation, infections and accidents, then atherosclerosis could not kill them. Some age-related diseases were almost unknown until recently.
Quasi-Program is Not a Program
The evolutionary theory explains that aging cannot be programmed. Still the notion that aging is programmed persists and was even "re-invented." In my mind, the reason why theories of programmed aging are still "alive" is that aging is so program-like. Human age-related diseases and menopause have distinct molecular, cellular and systemic mechanisms, which are not random at all. How can random damage drive these processes that are so development-like? Even nonprogrammed random molecular damage theories accept that menopause and death of Pacific salmon are programmed. But, like aging itself, they are not: they are quasi-programmed.
A quasi-program looks like as a program, but it is not. It is a continuation of some useful developmental program. It is a by-product. Unlike an actual program it has no purpose, nor plan. By giving a new application to the Dawkins words, I have the courage to write that, as the blind continuation of developmental growth, a quasi-program of aging "has no purpose in mind. It has no mind and no mind's eye. It does not plan for the future. It has no vision, no foresight, no sight at all."1
Amazingly, logical thinking could create non-programmed "damage/repair" theories on one hand, and "programmed aging" theories on the other hand. In contrast, blind watchmaker may unsuspectingly create only quasi-programmed aging. Of course, "DST-one" was not intended as a design theory, but in contrast, like "DST-two," it was inspired by Darwinian theory of natural selection. But at the end, one may characterize DST-one as a flawed application of BW thinking that, inadvertently, has the character of intelligent invention when viewed through the lens of hyperfunction theory (DST-two).

An Account of Scarlet Fever, as it occurred in George

Hcriot s Hospital, in the months ofOctober, November, and

December 1832, and January 1833. By William Wood?

r. II. S. E. and F. R. C. S. E.

During the prevalence of scarlet fever in this city, and its vicinity, towards the end of the year 1832, and beginning of the year 1833, I enjoyed an opportunity of seeing many cases of the disease in George Heriot's Hospital, one of our largest
charitable institutions for the maintenance and education ot
boys; and although I am well aware that I have nothing to communicate on the subject original in the way of remark, and nothing new to propose in practice, I shall lay before the Society a short account of the disease, believing that it will not be altogether uninteresting to the members to be in possession of ft history of the complaint as it occurred in a number of individuals of nearly the same age, under the same roof, and altogether in a similarity of circumstances.
I am the more disposed to undertake this duty, because I shall thereby enjoy an opportunity of bringing under the notice of the Society an excellent history of the same disease, as it occurred in the same hospital in the year 1804, published by my much esteemed friend Dr Hamilton Senior, Physician to the Institution, in the appendix to his invaluable work on Purga-
tive Medicines.
I may premise, that I have drawn up the history of the disease exclusively from the cases which occurred in the hospital during the late epidemic; and I have taken no notice of the
many varied modifications of it which have been observed at
other times and in other situations; nor have I made any allusion to the opinions or writings of medical men on the subject, it being my object to exhibit an accurate sketch of the disease, however rude, as it appeared in the hospital during the late epidemic, and to compare and to contrast that with the more finished picture of the same complaint, as it occurred in the same situation in the year 1804, drawn by Dr Hamilton.
George Heriot's Hospital, as is well known, stands in an open, airy situation; the rooms and wards are kept remarkably

clean, and well ventilated; the inmates are well fed and clothed, and are in general remarkably healthy. On the 23d October,
when the fever made its first appearance, the establishment con-
sisted of 179 boys, from 8 to 14 years of age; of 17 female, and 10 male adults, making in all a family of 206 persons; all at that time in good health, with the exception of several of the boys being affected with chronic scrofulous sores.
An attempt was made to ascertain how many of the boys had previously been affected with scarlet fever; but the information procured on this subject is vague and unsatisfactory. I may state, however, that of the 179 boys, 33 were said to have passed through the disease; 91 not to have had it; and in regard to the remaining 55, nothing was known.
44 of the boys became affected with the disease during the continuance of the epidemic; of whom 5 were supposed to have
had it previously; 26 not to have had it; and as to the remainnig 13, nothing could be ascertained.
Ot the 13o boys who escaped the complaint, 37 were said to have been previously affected with it; 67 not to have had it; and as to the other 41, nothing could be learnt.
The fever could not be traced into the Hospital; and it is rather remarkable that it appeared there while the inmates were under strict quarantine regulations, which had been enacted a
considerable time before for the exclusion of cholera. It is not

less remarkable, that, in another charitable institution in the near neighbourhood, containing nearly 100 young girls, in which similar quarantine regulations had been enforced, but had been removed some time before October, and the inmates had been
allowed to communicate as usual with their friends in the town,

scarlatina did not appear at all.
It ought, perhaps, to be mentioned here, that the son of one of the male servants of the Hospital, who, from the nature of his duty, is engaged during the greater part of the day with the boys, but who passes the night with his family in a small house immediately on the outside of the precincts of the Hospital, had been very tediously and dangerously ill of scarlet fever towards the end of August; the father, being in attendance on his son during his illness, was prevented from entering the grounds of the Hospital for nearly a month ; and the first case of the fever which occurred in the Hospital did not take place for above a
month from the time at which he was allowed to resume his

duties. Under these circumstances, it does not seem at all pro-

bable, though perhaps not impossible, that the disease was in-

troduced into the Hospital in this way.

From the time of its introduction into the institution, the

disease spread rapidly, notwithstanding precautionary measures

having been immediately taken to prevent, if possible, its exten-
separated sion. The boys who complained were immediately
from their healthy companions, and were placed, as soon as the
disease was ascertained to exist, in one of two rooms
appropriated exclusively to the reception of patients labouring under scarlet
fever. From these sick rooms tliey were removed to one of the sleeping wards fitted up for convalescents, where they were kept for a long time, for the purpose of preventing their coming contact with the uninfected boys, and of hindering them from exposing themselves prematurely to cold air, which had in one case produced alarming illness.
At the end of one month from the first appearance of the
disease, 30 of the boys had been attacked with it; at the.end of the second month IS more; and in another month 3 additional
cases were added to the list, making in all 45 cases in three months. The two boys first affected were taken ill in the same sleeping ward, but afterwards the disease occurred indiscriminately in the five. The two first cases, and by far the larger proportion of the whole, came from the sleeping room appropriated to the use of the younger boys.
In order to show the rate at which the fever extended, I may mention, that 1 boy was taken ill on 23d October; 1 on 25th; 2 on 26th; 2 on 5th November; 2 on 7th; 2 on 9th; 1 o# 10th; 1 on lltli; 3 on 12th; 2 on 13th; 1 on 14th; 5 o? 15th; 1 on 16th; 1 on 17th; 1 on 18th; 1 on 19tli; 1

December; 2 on 4th; 1 on 5th ; 1 on 6th; 1 on 9th; 1 10th ; 1 on 22d; 1 on 7th January; 1 on 8th; nurse on 20tbi in all, 45 cases.
In stating the number of cases of scarlet fever, I think it rigl'1 to mention, that twenty-nine of the forty-five patients were affected with both scarlet eruption and sore throat; and that sixted1 suffered from sore throat only, without any eruption having bed1 observed; these I considered as cases of scarlet fever, frotf1
the appearance of the throat and tongue, and from the naturc and extent of the fever. It being now, I believe, generally admitted, that, in families where scarlatina appears, some, even
the individuals who have not previously suffered from that disease, are occasionally affected with it in the form of sore thro^
only. That the complaint in the sixteen boys above alluded to
actually scarlatina, I consider proved by the fact, that none them became afterwards affected with fever and eruption, though
very freely exposed to the contagion in the sick rooms and con' valescent ward. During the prevalence of scarlatina in tl'c Hospital, many of the boys, independently of those here state'

to have been affected with that disease, suffered from sore throat and temporary fever. 1 think there is little reason to doubt, that, in some of these cases at least, the complaint was a modification of scarlatina. I have not reckoned any of them, how. ever, as cases of that disease, but I kept them separate from the scarlet fever patients, and as much as possible, consistently with the accommodation in the Hospital, from the healthy boys.
Of the twenty-nine patients who, in addition to sore throat, exhibited the scarlet eruption, two were said to have passed preMously through scarlet fever,?twenty-two not to have done so, ?and nothing was known with respect to the other five.
Ot the sixteen patients who were affected with sore throat without eruption, three were understood to have been affected previously with scarlet fever, four not to have been so,?and, with regard to the other nine, no information could be procured.
rlhe epidemic fortunately proved a mild one, and one only of the forty-five patients died. I have no hesitation, however, in attributing, at least in some degree, the mildness of the complaint and the smallness of the mortality, to the favourable circumstances under which the sick were placed. The moment a boy complained, he was put under the care of one of the ordi-
nary female attendants of the house; and, as soon as the disease was ascertained to exist, he was removed to one of the scarlet fever wards, which were under the charge of careful day and night nurses ; and Dr Hamilton Senior and myself, the medical attendants, had unlimited powers from the governors of ordering whatever was thought necessary for the comfort of the sick and
convalescent.

The disease generally commenced with headach, loss of appe-

tite, and sickness, attended in some of the cases with frequent

vomiting. These symptoms were very quickly followed by great

frequency of pulse and heat of skin. In most of the cases the

patients complained at the same time of pain in the throat and

difficulty in swallowing. Vomiting was much more frequently

met with in the commencement of the epidemic than afterwards,

when it became of rare occurrence. This I was disposed to at-

tribute to the early exhibition of purgative medicines, in conse-

quence of the boys, from becoming aware of the existence of the

complaint in the Hospital, reporting themselves to be sick at the

very commencement of the disease.

The intensity and duration of the primary fever varied much

in the different individuals. The pulse was in all of them very

quick, and the skin intensely hot; and these symptoms gene-

rally appeared almost from the commencement of the complaint.

Delirium and great restlessness were frequent concomitants ot

this stage of the disease.

occasionally fell considerably below the natural standard, and continued so for some time during the patient's convalescence*
In all the cases there was more or less affection of the throat)

although in some of them it was so slight and so little complain' ed of, that, but for frequent examination, its existence might have escaped detection. I am disposed to think, from my o^n experience, that the existence of true scarlatina without soWe affection of the throat is a very rare occurrence, and that, upon careful and frequent inspection, it will generally be found to he
more or less inflamed. In none of the cases was there any ex-

tensive sloughing of the throat; in several of them there was

?

?

?

A

foul ulceration ; in many the fauces and tonsils were affected

with aphtha?, exhibiting, when these were removed, superficial ulceration. The fauces were frequently covered with a tough) dirty-white mucus, giving an appearance which might be mis-
taken by a careless observer for extensive sloughing. The submaxillary glands were generally more or less enlarged.
The scarlet eruption, in those cases in which it appeared, varied in the different individuals in intensity of colour, in duration, and in the extent of surface which it covered ; and the de-

gree of desquamation of the skin, which almost always took place
to a greater or less extent, seemed connected with these circuit' stances. There was very frequently observed, previously to the appearance of the eruption, a considerable redness of the tunic<* conjunctiva, which came to be considered a pretty certain indication of its approach.
The tongue, in by far the greater number of cases, was moist? generally, in the early stages of the disease, white, with its papillae red and projecting; giving an appearance considered to be in some degree characteristic of scarlatina. In the later stage3 it was frequently preternaturally red and tender, and occasion' ally superficially ulcerated. In one case, in which the throat was much ulcerated and foul, the tongue was dark-red, parched and glossy, and the teeth covered with brown sordes. In the milder
cases there was little thirst. The mucous membrane of the nosc

was frequently observed to be inflamed. Of the forty-five patients none died, and only three were con'
sidered in any great danger, from the primary symptoms of the disease ; including under that term the affection of the throat) and the eruptive fever. Of those who were dangerously ill fr?nl these causes, one was James Souter, a boy of 12 years of ag?> who, during the first forty-eight hours of the complaint, was affected with very violent and frequently repeated convulsion fits* He had been attacked in a similar way during the eruptive stag" of measles, and when labouring under hooping-cough. Another was Mrs Souter, the mother of James Souter, a widow of 28 yeafS

of age, who, after having acted for about two months as sicknurse to about thirty of the patients, became herself affected with the disease, of which she was very alarmingly and tediously
ill. From the continuation of foul ulceration of the throat, and
from the duration of the accompanying fever, which partook
very much of the typhoid character, there was much reason to tear that she would have died of exhaustion. 1 he third case was George Watson, aged "12, who was also considered in great danger from the same causes which excited our apprehension in the last patient.
The treatment of the disease in its primary form was extremely simple. In some of the earlier cases emetics of ipecacuan were administered at the commencement of the complaint; but in the later cases purgative medicines were used in preference, and repeated almost daily till the fever had subsided, when they were continued at intervals, more or less short, till the patient was considered perfectly cured.
The purgatives employed were compound powder of jalap, Epsom salts, compound colocynth pills, infusion of senna, jalap and calomel, supertartrate of potass, &c. varied according to circumstances. The patients were kept in a room moderately cool, and well-ventilated; and great attention was paid to cleanliness. During the eruptive fever, when the heat of skin was considerably above the natural standard, the surface of the body was frequently sponged, sometimes with cold, but more frequently with tepid water; and this practice was continued till the skin became of a more natural temperature, and had begun to desquamate, in those cases in which the eruption had appeared. Great relief was derived from this practice, which was extremely agreeable to the patients. They were kept on low diet, being allow-
ed only panado, gruel, or weak tea and bread, except in the cases, which were few in number, where the fever assumed much of the typhoid type, in which wine was cautiously given.
During the period of convalescence, the diet consisted of beeftea, light pudding, or fresh broth. In a few cases, where the strength was much diminished, a little wine was thought necessary. There were only eight cases, however, in all, in which wine was employed. The warm bath was frequently used, and apparently with much advantage, in diminishing the feverish excitement, and in bringing down the pulse during the desquamation
of the skin. At this stage of the disease, with the view of pre-
venting, if possible, the dropsical symptoms, a tea-spoonful of the supertartrate of potass was given twice or thrice a-day to almost all the patients, along with occasional purgatives* In one
or two of the eases, after the fever had subsided, moderate doses

produced of laudanum were found useful in allaying irritation,
by the state of the skin, and in procuring sleep.
In a few cases, where the throat was much swelled and in-
flamed, leeches were applied; but more generally this affection was treated by the use of a stimulating gargle, consisting of mfusion of roses, containing a proportion of muriatic acid, and tincture of capsicum. Where there was great tenderness of the throat, this gargle was found occasionally too stimulating, and hot milk and water were employed in its stead.
The principal danger of the disease was occasioned by th& secondary affections, including under that head dropsical effusions, swelling and suppuration of the glands behind the ear, and suppuration in the ear. During the period of con* valescence, nine of the forty-five patients became affected with dropsical swelling. In three of them, in the form of slight oedema below the under eyelids ; in four the oedema affected the face as well as the eyelids; in two it was more extensive, affecting in one of them also the hands; and in the other, in who# the disease proved fatal, the face, hands and arms, feet and legs? and, as was proved by dissection, effusion of serum had taken place into the cavities of the head and abdomen. The average period at which the dropsical symptoms appeared from the com' mencement of the fever was nineteen days,?the earliest being sixteen, and the latest twenty-three.
In consequence of the first patient who was affected with scarlet fever having fallen a victim to the dropsical affection* the nurses were very watchful, and generally pointed out the first appearance of oedema, which usually showed itself belo^ one or both of the under eyelids. Jalap, or neutral salts, with calomel, were immediately administered, and the warm bath was employed. Whenever symptoms occurred indicative of any in-
general ternal affection, particularly when attended with fever,
or local blood-letting, according to circumstances, was had recourse to; and these were immediately followed by the employ-
repeated ment of tartrate of antimony in small but frequently
doses,?a medicine which proved essentially useful in many of
the cases. The supertartrate of potass, and in one or two cases the tincture of digitalis, were prescribed as diuretics, but along
with purgative medicines. The patients who became affected with dropsical symptoms
were not those who had been most severely ill of the primary
fever.
In five of the nine boys who suffered from secondary affeC' tions, one or more of the glands behind the ear became swelled and inflamed. In one the swelling acquired a very large size, gave much pain, and when opened, there were discharged from

ne or the patients thus affected was Daniel Mathieson, aged lie was originally taken ill on the Ttli November, and was considered euved on the 2d December; having had the fever in a. very distinct, and in ratlier a severe form ; the throat had been much inflamed and ulcerated; tlie eruption had been very vivid, and there had been much desquamation of the skin. On the night of tlie 4tli December he slept ill, owing to pain in a slightly enlarged gland behind the right car. On the 5th ic was hot and uneasy, and his pulse quick; he vomited after naving taken a close of sulphate of magnesia with calomel. In tile evening a copious scarlet eruption appeared over the body and limbs, apparently irf the same character with the rash in
scarlet tever; and the throat became inflamed and painful, the
inflammation being of a dark-red colour. On the Gth the rash was nearly gone; the skin was more cool; the pulse 84 ; took a dose of salts ; on the Ttli, the rash was quite gone, the throat was still much inflamed, and tlie tonsils swelled; the face was

form, may remain subject to a recurrence of the disease, even after a short interval of time, in the event of their being freely exposed to the contagion. In the three cases which occurred in the hospital, the secondary eruption, fever, and affection of the throat appeared when the boys were surrounded by numerous companions labouring under scarlatina.
Two of the boys when ill of secondary symptoms of the disease were attacked with erysipelas in the face and head,?a complaint extremely prevalent at that time in the town and its vicinity, as well as in the hospital; and one of them had no less than four attacks of erysipelas in the course of his convalescence from the fever, in all of which it was seated in the face and
head.
Having now concluded this very long, and, I fear, very tedious history of scarlet fever as it occurred in George Heriots Hospital, I shall intrude on the time of the society for only a very short time, for the purpose of bringing under notice the very able and interesting account of a similar epidemic which appeared in the same hospital in the year 1804. It is published by Dr Hamilton Senior, under whose care the patients were. There is a very great similarity in the two epidemics. The first case of the disease appeared in the end of September 1804, and it continued to prevail for three months. There were at that time 120 boys, and 20 adults in the institution. Upwards of 50 of the boys took the fever, which was mild and little dangerous in the primary stages; but it proved fatal in three of
the patients from the secondary affections. " In all the children, particularly in those who were first af-
fected, the symptoms were so mild, that, but for my knowledge of the prevalence of the epidemic in town, I might have mis-
taken the disease on its first appearance, and been lulled into a
blameable security. The throat was not much affected; the uvula and amygdalae were slightly swelled and inflamed in every instance ; in a few cases, superficial suppuration and sloughing appeared. The efflorescence on the surface was partial, and in general transitory, leaving a peculiar paleness of countenance. The eye was dull and heavy. Sickness and prostration of appetite continued throughout the disease. The thirst was moderate ; great debility prevailed in every case; and in some & peculiar dejection and despondency, hardly to be looked for i? subjects so young. The pulse was variable ; always quick, till towards the end of the disease, when it sometimes sunk belo^ the natural standard; it was never full. The surface of the body was occasionally of a pungent heat. Obstinate constipation prevailed in general.
" My patients were objects of serious attention for twelve or

fourteen days ; the convalescent state of almost all of them was protracted for nearly the same length of time ; and six weeks elapsed before some who entered the sick room left it.
" ,^u.c^ was the appearance, and such is the history of this epidemic in Ileriofs Hospital; in conducting the care of which,
I employed purgative medicines fully ; while food suited to the weak appetite and feeble powers of digestion was directed.
I lie effect of the purgatives was favourable. The feces were hard, generally of a black, or greenish colour, and fetid; and sometimes of the colour and consistence of clay, and less fetid. In proportion to the evacuation of these feces, relief was perceptible. Returning appetite and vivacity accompanied the decline
and cessation of the various symptoms.
" As the weather had bccome cold, and otherwise inclement, the children were detained in the sick-room for many days after they were perfectly well; purgatives were administered, as the state of the bowels demanded ; and the general warm bath was repeatedly used, on the supposition that, by its restoring a perspirable state of the skin, it would, in concert with the purgative medicines, tend to prevent dropsical swelling, which, from the symptoms, I greatly dreaded.
" At last, healthy, and robust, and impatient of farther restraint, the convalescents were permitted to return to their particular wards, and, in no long time, to mix with their companions in school and at play.
" Happy I am that I had been thus careful and provident in using these precautions; for I have to relate the fate of three boys, who, in two or three weeks from their passing from under my care, were again reported as unwell, and again appear-
ed in the sick-room. Their symptoms and their fate were the
same. They had a leucophlegmatic look, incipient anasarca, total prostration of appetite, scanty, if not suspended secretion of urine, swelling of abdomen, obstinate constipation, nausea, extreme debility, and feeble pulse.
" Alarmed by these symptoms, I requested Messrs Alexander and George Wood, surgeons to the hospital, to join me in consultation. Suitable cordials were ordered, and purgative medicines of appropriate quality, and in repeated doses, were directed. The disease, in all the three, proceeded with a rapidity which afforded little farther opportunity for deliberation or ac-
tion. The stomach gave way ; all food, cordials, and medicines, were rejected, by vomiting. The watery effusion rapidly filled the cellular membrane, and inundated every cavity.
Within less than thirty-six hours from the recurrence of the ailment, the boys died, labouring under symptoms denoting ascites, hydrothorax, and hydrocephalus.

" This termination was altogether new; I had never seen dropsy from scarlatina fatal. In consequence of this event, I approached the hospital for many days under deep anxiety, be-
cause I was conscious that other children were at the time in a
situation which might lead to the same unfortunate issue.1' * As some of the cases which occurred in Heriot's Hospital
during the late epidemic appear to me to be interesting, from the nature and severity of the secondary affections, which proved fatal in one instance, I consider it almost unnecessary to apologize to the society for bringing under their notice these cases in detail, and for giving an account of the appearances found on dissection in the body of the boy who died.
Archibald Bain, act. 10, was attacked with scarlatina on the 23d October, and had both eruption and sore throat. The fever did not run very high, but was of long duration, and materially diminished his strength. On 9th November, when convalescent, though still confined to bed, oedema appeared in his face, and soon extended to his hands and feet, attended by violent pain in the back part of the head. These symptoms were somewhat
alleviated by the treatment employed; but they soon returned in an aggravated form, and on the 20th November he was attacked with violent convulsion fits, frequently repeated, attended with excruciating pain in the head. At one time lie was deprived of his eyesight, which, however, returned, and lie remained sensible at intervals, till within a few hours of his death, which took place on the 23d November.
During the existence of the dropsical symptoms, the urine was found to contain albumen, and was of less specific gravity
than usual.
When the unfavourable symptoms appeared, from being languid and feeble, it was not deemed prudent to employ general blood-letting. A number of leeches were repeatedly applied to the temples and forehead, and blisters to the head. The bowels were powerfully acted upon by calomel and saline purgatives; and diuretics, particularly tincture of digitalis, were administered.
Dissection.?Before opening the body, it was remarked, that the oedema had very much subsided. After sawing through the skull-cap, the dura mater was found to adhere very firmly to it. A great deal of venous engorgement appeared on the brain, and the sinuses were full of coagulated blood. Considerable effusion had taken place between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater, the former being preternaturally thick. The jmncta rubra were not more numerous than usual, and the substance of the upper part of the brain was quite natural. One or two ounces of serous fluid were found in the ventricles, with ramollissement of the fornix, nates and testes. The choroid

plexus was not so vascular as in the healthy state. The corpus callosum, thalami, and corpora striata, were quite natural in
structure and appearance.
A small quantity of serous fluid was found in the abdomen. The intestines, kidneys, &c. seemed to be quite sound.
It was ascertained that several children of the family had died of hydrocephalus.
David Gray, aged 9, was attacked with scarlatina on the 7th of January, and was affected with a considerable degree of sore throat, and with scarlet eruption. The disease, on the whole,
was rather severe. On the 25th, when convalescent, but still confined to bed, slight oedema appeared of the left upper eyelid. On the 27th, both the eyelids were oedematous ; all the functions, however, were natural. For several days he had taken calomel and other purgative medicines. In the evening
of this day, he complained of severe pain in the head, and the oedema of the face had considerably extended. He took a dose of the infusion of senna, which produced both purging and vomiting. On the 28th, he had slept well; the headach was quite gone ; the tongue was clean, skin cool, and pulse 70. The infusion of senna was ordered to be repeated, which produced the same effects as formerly.
29th. 9 a. ax. Had complained much of pain in the forehead during the preceding afternoon. The oedema of the face was somewhat increased ; the pulse below the natural standard. At 10 i\ m., he became insensible, and was seized with strong convulsions. He was put into a warm bath ; a large blister was applied between the shoulders, and sinapisms to the feet; a stimulating injection was given, which operated freely. Since 3 A. M., he has been sensible, complaining occasionally of pain in the fore and back part of the head; the oedematous swelling of the face is considerably diminished; tongue clean ; pulse 72, and irregular. Ten leeches were applied to the temples and forehead, and a dose of calomel and sulphate of magnesia ordered. 4 p. m. Has vomited frequently, in consequence of which the calomel and salts were not given, but he had a purgative injection. The leeches have bled very freely. He has had since morning many attacks of convulsions. He is at present insensible, and the muscles of the right eye and mouth, and side of the face, are in constant convulsive action. The pupils of both eyes are dilated, and insensible to the light of a candle; the pulse is quick, irregular, and feeble ; he has been occasionally sensible to-day between the fits. 8 p. m. Convulsions went off soon after four o'clock, and have not returned ; he is quite sensible, but seems to have a difficulty in speaking; the eyes are of a more natural appearance, and the pupils contract on

From this time he continued to improve, till the 6th, when there was slight oedema of the right side of the face, which was removed by purgative medicines, and from that period lie

William Lapsley,aged 11, was taken ill on the 9th November, and was affected with both sore throat and eruption, attended with a pretty smart degree of fever. On the 25th, when convalescent, he complained of pain in one of the glands behind the left ear, and of severe pain in the back of the head. The face was observed to be slightly cedematous. He was ordered to be bled, but only two ounces of blood were procured; and calomel and saline purgatives were administered. On the 26th, the swelling of the gland was rather increased in size, but was not inflamed externally ; he complained much of pain in it, stretching up to the top of the head. Ten leeches were applied to the neck, which bled freely. In the evening, his head was more painful, his breathing was hurried and oppressed, and the
oedema of the face increased. Six ounces of blood were taken
from the arm, which was somewhat buff'y. The purgatives were repeated, and acted freely. He slept ill during the night, complaining much of pain in the left side of the head. On the 27th, pain o? the head was somewhat lessened, oedema of the face had nearly disappeared, and the breathing was much relieved. Pulse was 84, and soft; a warm bath was administered, after being removed from which, a copious perspiration broke out, and he seemed much better. At night, the swelling behind the ear was enlarged in size, and more painful. The pain in his head, and the oedema of the face, were much increased, and the breathing was hurried and oppressed; a dose of calomel was given, and one-sixth of a grain of tartrate of antimony, dissolved in

ing his sleep. Twelve leeches were applied to the temples, which bled freely, and the antimony was continued. On the 29th, his face was less swelled, and the lieadach quite relieved. He had passed a better night, and was in a state of nausea from the antimonial medicine ; pulse 80, and soft. The solution was
ordered to be continued, and half a drachm of supertartrate of potass to be given. In the evening, pain of the head had returned, and twelve leeches were applied to the left temple, which
bled freely. He was ordered to take one-eighth of a grain of tartrate of antimony every quarter of an hour.
30th. Complained during the night of pain in the right side of his head, and his sleep was much disturbed. He remained in a state of nausea for five or six hours, when the medicine was intermitted. To-day he looked more lively, and says the lieadach is gone ; pulse 100, and soft; bowels very open. Towards afternoon, complained again of pain on the right side of the head. The tartrate of antimony was ordered to be given, by which he was kept in a state of nausea for some hours. He had some quiet sleep, and perspired freely. The eyes, which were occasionally dull, appeared more lively, and the iris, which had been sluggish in its action, contracted more readily on the approach of a candle.
1st December. The headach was gone; pulse 82, and soft. He was in a state of nausea during the night, and slept more quietly. Swelling behind the ear was much diminished in size, and gave no pain. Continued well till the 4th, when he began to complain of pain in the left side of his head ; pulse was 96. The antimony was ordered to be given every quarter
of an hour.
5th. He became sick and vomited after a few doses of the
antimony, and since that time has been free from pain in his head. Slept well; pulse 82 ; seems lively, and makes no complaint. Was ordered to take a dose of cream of tartar thrice a-day.
From this time he continued to improve daily, and, on the 14th January, he left the sick-room perfectly well.
Alexander Bain, aged 12, brother of the boy who died, was taken ill on the 14th November, and became affected both with sore throat and eruption. On the 4th December he was re-
moved to the convalescent ward.
Having incautiously exposed himself to cold on the forenoon of the 6th, he was taken ill at night with fever, and severe pain in his legs and thighs, in consequence of which he was brought back to the sick-room, and placed among the patients labouring
under scarlet fever.

was ordered. 4 p. m. He has complained since morning of severe pain in the breast; the oedema of the face is increased ; pulse 84; the calomel has not operated. Eight ounces of blood
were ordered to be taken from the arm, and a dose of salts was
prescribed. 8 v. m. The blood, of which fully nine ounces were taken, flowed freely; it is cupped, and exhibits some appearance of size. There is a scarlet eruption on the face and upper part of the breast; pain of breast is quite gone; the oedema of the face is rather diminished. Salts operated well; pulse 92; skin hot. One-eighth of a grain of tartrate of antimony was ordered to be given every quarter of an hour. 8th December. Vomited after taking four doses of the antimony, when it was intermitted. A dose of saltswas ordered to be given this morning, which operated well. He coughed frequently during the night. An additional quantity of scarlet eruption appeared late last night on the upper part of the breast and face, which to-day is nearly gone ; the oedema of the face is much diminished ; skin is less hot; pulse 84; tongue clean ; is free from pain. From this date he continued to improve, and was reckoned again convalescent on the 19th December. The urine passed during the existence of the cedematous symptoms was not coagulable by heat.
On the 29th December, while still confined to the sick-room, he complained again of severe headach, and pain on both sides
of the neck behind the ears, in consequence of which he took
five doses of the tartrate of antimony, at intervals of a quarter of an hour, which produced vomiting and free general perspiration. 30th. The headach abated last night, and he slept well. To-day, complains of much pain on both sides of the neck, and of pain and difficulty in swallowing. The throat is inflamed; the facc flushed; and skin very hot; pulse 118. There is upon the breast and other parts of the body a blush of red, very much resembling the eruption of scarlatina. The solution of tartrate of antimony was ordered to be given. 31st. Took six doses of the antimonial mixture, after which he became sick and vomited, and after the interval of an hour it was again exhibited. He took eight doses, which produced sickness but no vomiting. Betwixt 7 and 8 p. m. he complained of very violent pain in the forehead, in consequence of which, seven ounces of blood were taken from the arm, when sickness and vomiting came on. The blood was very buffy; slept well; and on awaking in the morning, said the pain in his head and neck was completely gone. The eruption continued visible for some hours after the visit of yesterday, but disappeared in the evening. At present he makes no complaint. The inflammation of the throat is less ; skin cool and soft; tongue clcan and moist; bowels open ; pulse

80. 1st January. About 2 p. m. yesterday, complained again of severe pain in the forehead ; was hot and restless. He took eight doses of the antimonial solution. At 7 p. m. he became sick and vomited, and perspired freely, after which the pain in the head was very much diminished. He slept quietly during the night. To-day he is entirely free from pain.
2d January. At 2 p. m. yesterday, complained of some pain in the right side of his neck; skin was very hot; pulse 120. At 10 p. m. complained greatly of pain in his throat; the tonsils and fauces were much swelled and inflamed, and of a darkred colour. Took two compound colocynth pills, and used the stimulating gargle. 3d January. The bowels were moved freely during yesterday. He still complains to-day of much pain in the throat, but the swelling and inflammation are less; tongue is foul; skin hot; pulse 120. To have a dose of Epsom salts. 4th. Salts operated well; passed a quiet night; has much less pain in swallowing, and the inflammation of the fauces and tonsils is greatly diminished. There is some inflammation of the mucous membrane of the nostrils; tongue cleaner; skin cool; pulse 100. Two aloetic pills to be given at bed-time. 5th January. Pills operated ; is in all respects much better; pulse 80. From this time he continued to improve rapidly, and on the 14th left the sick-room quite well.
The two boys Bain belonged to a very large family, of whom
two had died of water in the head.
George Wright, aged 11, was seized with scarlet fever on the 15th November, and was affected with both sore throat and eruption. The eruptive fever was rather severe. On the 2d December slight oedema of the face appeared, and continued more or less for some days, without any other unpleasant symptom. Purgative medicines and supertartrate of potass were administered. On the morning of the 8th December he was free from complaint, but at night he complained of pain in his throat, soon followed by headach and heat of skin. On the 9th, at 10 a. m. he was very uneasy, complaining much of headach; his breathing was quick and oppressed ; pulse 120 ; the heart beating very strongly; his face was flushed and slightly swelled; the skin was hot, and on the breast and body covered with a scarlet eruption; one of the glands behind the right ear was swelled and painful. Ten ounces of blood were taken from the arm, and a dose of calomel and sulphate of magnesia were prescribed. 3 p. at. The blood flowed freely, and in a full stream ; it is cupped and sizy ; he has perspired copiously, and he seems very much relieved; pulse is less frequent, and is soft; purgative medicines have not yet operated. Was ordered a dose of Epsom salts. 9 p. m. The salts were rejected by vomiting,

Was ordered to take the solution of tartrate of antimony during the night if he became more uneasy. 10th, 10 a. m. Took the solution twice, in consequence of having complained of pain in his head; he became sick, and the pain abated, after which he slept well; complains of pain in a small swelling behind the right ear, but says he feels generally better; the nose and upper lip are much swelled, and covered with erysipelatous inflammation; skin soft; tongue loaded; pulse 120 and full. Two compound colocynth pills were administered, to be followed at the distance of three hours by a dose of Epsom salts. 8 p. m. The erysipelatous inflammation has extended over part of each cheek; makes no complaint; skin moist; pulse 96. 11th, 10 a. m. Purgative medicines operated well; there is much uneasiness in the throat in swallowing, but it cannot be examined in consequence of the swelling of the lip ; skin hot; pulse 120. One-eighth of a grain of tartrate of antimony was ordered to be given every half-hour. 8 p.m. Seven doses of the antimony were retained, the eighth was vomjted. There is a copious perspiration all over the surface of the body; pulse 80 and soft; small vesicles have appeared on the face. 12th. Passed a good night; complains of pain in his throat and behind the left ear. The erysipelatous inflammation has disappeared from the right cheek, but is extending on the left, where it is of a darker red, and several vesicles have formed upon it; pulse 100 and soft; bowels very open. 13th. Complains principally of pain behind the left ear; inflammation of the left cheek has extended upwards to the scalp; skin hot; breathing quick; pulse 125; bowels open. A dose of the an-
timonial solution to be given every half-hour. 14tli. After taking seven doses of the mixture he vomited, after which he was much relieved ; the skin became cooler; the pulse less quick ; he passed a good night, but at eight this morning complained of severe pain in the upper part of his head. Two doses of the antimonial solution were given with relief. The erysipelas has extended over a considerable portion of the scalp; there is much inflammation and swelling of the left eyelids; vesicles on the cheek have discharged; pulse 120; bowels open.

peaved. He continued, however, to recover slowly till the end of January, having in the interval complained much of pain in both ears, but without any discharge. In the beginning of February he was sent to his own ward and to school.
On the 15th of that month he returned to the sick-room, in consequence of an attack of erysipelas in the left cheek, attended with fever and much headach. Leeches were applied to the temples; purgative medicines were given, with the occasional use of the antimonial solution, from this date to the 20th, when the erysipelas disappeared, leaving, however, frequent attacks of severe pain in the head, which were treated by the frequent application of leeches, by blistering, &c. &c. On the 25th the upper lip was much swollen, and erysipelas appeared on both cheeks, which continued for some days, attended with fever, much pain in the head, and occasional delirium.

March 11th. Since last report has continued to complain oc-

casionally of much pain in his head and breast, with almost con-

stant throbbing pain in one or both ears, but, on the whole, has

been gradually improving.

March 28th. Has continued much of an invalid, though oc-

casionally out of bed, and has almost constantly complained of

more or less pain in both ears, from which there has been dis-

charged to-day a quantity of purulent matter. He had a slight

threatening of erysipelas on the 24th.

April IGtli. Has continued to convalesce slowly, complaining

occasionally of pain in the head and ear, in consequence of which

complaints he is still confined to the sick-room.

From this time he continued to improve in health, and made

a complete recovery.

CASE REPORT
Rescuing the Rescuer: Fractured Dormia Basket and a Second Basket Rescue Technique
Iyad Khamaysi1, Eisa Hajj2
Abstr ac t
Mechanical lithotripsy is one of the well-known rescue methods for impacted common bile duct (CBD) stones. A fractured Dormia basket with a captured stone is an unusual complication and poses a special management problem. In the past, surgical intervention was the standard method. Various nonsurgical techniques have been reported. If the impaction is at the level of the papilla, extending the sphincterotomy might be sufficient. Stent insertion, endoscopic mechanical lithotripsy, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, endoscopic laser lithotripsy, and transhepatic choledochoscopic lithotripsy have all been reported. In this case, we used a second basket, which is readily available and less expensive, as a rescue technique. Keywords: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, Fractured Dormia Basket, Rescue.

A 71-year-old woman had an 8-week history of biliary-like abdominal pain and abnormal liver function tests. A cholecystectomy was performed 15 years before presentation.
Transabdominal ultrasound and CT of the abdomen showed only CBD dilatation (up to 12 mm).
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) showed a paradiverticular papilla and dilated CBD with a 12-mm floating stone (Fig. 1A).
During endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), sphincterotomy was done and the stone was caught by a Dormia basket (Fig. 1A), but unfortunately, while retrieving the basket, it was impacted at the level of the papilla. A rescue mechanical lithotripsy was initiated. The duodenoscope was withdrawn and the Soehendra metal sheath was advanced over the exposed Dormia basket under fluoroscopic control (Fig. 1B). However, while cranking the lithotripter, the four wires of the basket were fractured leaving the stone/basket complex impacted in the distal CBD (Fig. 1B). Due to the paradiverticular position, the sphincterotomy could not be further extended, so a 12-mm-balloon sphincteroplasty was performed and a second Dormia basket was introduced. The stone/basket complex was disengaged; the stone was retrieved successfully but the fractured basket tip went proximally into the right hepatic duct. After many attempts, the

Mechanical lithotripsy is one of the well-known rescue methods for impacted CBD stones.1 A fractured Dormia basket with a captured stone is an unusual complication and poses a special management problem. In the past, surgical intervention was the standard method. Various nonsurgical techniques have been reported. If the impaction is at the level of the papilla, extending the sphincterotomy might be sufficient. Stent insertion, endoscopic mechanical lithotripsy, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, endoscopic laser lithotripsy, and transhepatic choledochoscopic lithotripsy have all been reported.2
In this case, we used a second basket, which is readily available and less expensive, as a rescue technique.
To the best of our knowledge, only three similar cases,3,4 in which a second basket was used to retrieve the fractured

basket and impacted stone, were published so far in English literature.

From rabbit antibody repertoires to rabbit monoclonal antibodies
Justus Weber, Haiyong Peng and Christoph Rader
In this review, we explain why and how rabbit monoclonal antibodies have become outstanding reagents for laboratory research and increasingly for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Starting with the unique ontogeny of rabbit B cells that affords highly distinctive antibody repertoires rich in in vivo pruned binders of high diversity, affinity and specificity, we describe the generation of rabbit monoclonal antibodies by hybridoma technology, phage display and alternative methods, along with an account of successful humanization strategies.

INTRODUCTION European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus; Figure 1) have played an important role as animal models in immunology for many decades.1,2 Today, rabbits are still a major source for a wide variety of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) with broad utility. pAbs can be described as a set of different antibodies generated in response to a specific pathogen or antigen, generally targeting different epitopes. mAbs, on the other hand, contain a defined antigen-binding site (paratope) that typically binds with high affinity and specificity to only one epitope. From a pharmaceutical point of view, mAbs provide a molecularly defined and reproducible product, whereas pAbs are traditionally an imprecise mixture of different antibodies.3 As is the case for mouse and human mAbs, IgG is the most common isotype of rabbit mAbs (Figure 2).
Rabbit pAbs have been used extensively as analytical tools in biomedical research and especially for immunological techniques, such as immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting and flow cytometry. Rabbit pAbs have also been utilized as an important tool for food safety assessments.4 In addition, rabbit pAbs have been used in a clinical context. A prominent example is anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). ATG is a mixture of purified polyclonal rabbit, horse or goat IgGs against human T cells that has been used as an immunosuppressive drug for decades. In organ and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, ATG application causes rapid depletion of T cells, leading to a decreased risk for rejection and acute graft-versus-host disease. However, ATG does not induce long-term tolerance.5

Rabbit ATG is one of the most commonly used ATGs, due to its higher lymphocytotoxicity compared to horse ATG.6 Rabbit ATG known as Thymoglobulin (Sanofi Genzyme, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998. More recently, an improved rabbit pAbs cocktail targeting human leukocytes was reported as a potential immunosuppressive drug in xenogeneic (for example, pig to human) organ transplantation.7 In addition, one rabbit pAb is currently approved by the FDA as an in vitro diagnostic tool (c-Kit pharmDx; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) for the IHC-based detection of CD117 (c-kit) expression in gastrointestinal stromal tumors to aid treatment decisions.8
mAbs and mAb-derived antibody therapeutics9,10 are currently widely used to treat human diseases, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases.11,12 Although no therapeutic rabbit mAbs have been approved by the FDA thus far, 11 rabbit mAbs are FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic tools in the clinic.13,14 Ten of these mAbs are being used to detect the expression of tumor-associated antigens, including HER2, estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and PD-L1. One mAb is used to detect helicobacter pylori infections. A rabbit mAb to human androgen receptor splice variant 7 has emerged as a promising tool for the detection of circulating tumor cells by immunofluorescence and IHC in prostate cancer.15,16 In addition, several rabbit mAb-derived therapeutics are currently being investigated in clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials. gov. In oncology, examples include sevacizumab (Simcere Pharmaceutical Group, Inc., Nanjing, China), a humanized

Figure 2 Schematic drawing of natural rabbit antibodies in IgG format. The ~ 150-kDa rabbit IgG molecule contains two identical  (white) or  (light gray) light chains paired with two identical heavy chains (dark gray). The light chain consists of an N-terminal variable domain (VL), shown with its three CDRs, followed by one constant domain (CL). The heavy chain consists of an N-terminal variable domain (VH), also shown with its three CDRs, followed by three constant domains (CH1, CH2 and CH3). CH1 and CH2 are linked through a flexible hinge region that has the amino-acid sequence APSTCSKPTCP (or APSTCSKPMCP in an allotypic variant) and anchors three disulfide bridges (orange) of the IgG molecule, one for each of the two light- and heavy-chain pairs, and one for the heavy-chain pair. Notably, rabbits have two  light chains, K1 and K2. The more frequent  light chain, K1, contains an additional disulfide bridge that links VL and CL. Rabbits of the commonly used New Zealand White strain have ~ 90% IgG- (K1), ~ 10% IgG- (K2) and o1% IgG- antibodies. CDR, complementarity-determining region.

Currently, only a handful of companies develop rabbit or rabbit-derived mAbs for laboratory research and for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Some of the companies in the global market are Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, UK; RabMAb platform; through acquisition of Epitomics, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA, in 2012); Alcon, Inc. (through acquisition of ESBAtech, Inc., Schlieren, Switzerland in 2009); Apexigen, Inc. (San Carlos, CA, USA; spun out by Epitomics, Inc. in 2010); Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA; currently listing 44000 different rabbit mAbs); Agilent Technologies, Inc.; MAB Discovery, Inc., Neuried, Germany; Lab Vision Corporation, Inc., Fremont, CA, USA; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (Carlsbad, CA, USA; Invitrogen ABfinity recombinant rabbit antibodies); and Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. (Tucson, AZ, USA).

What is the attraction of rabbit antibodies for the applica-
tions discussed above? Rabbits have been used to investigate
immunological questions and to develop immunological techniques for 4100 years. Thus, many standard procedures are established, published and validated, such as immunization and purification methods yielding high amounts of rabbit antibodies.25 In addition to these practical considerations,
rabbits are characterized by a variety of natural features that
make their antibody repertoire very attractive for the discussed
applications. First, rabbits belong to the order Lagomorpha,
which is evolutionary distinct from the order Rodentia, to which, for example, mice and rats belong.26-29 Rabbit
antibodies are able to recognize epitopes on human antigens that are not immunogenic in rodents,30 increasing the total
number of targetable epitopes and facilitating the generation of
antibodies that cross-react with mouse orthologs of human antigens.31-33 This is an important aspect for basic research and
preclinical investigations with, for example, human tumor
xenografts, where the presence or absence of on-target-off-
tumor toxicities of therapeutic antibodies provides important
information prior to clinical translation. In general, rabbit anti-mouse reactivity is valuable in mouse models of human
disease and has also been exploited in basic research, for example, on mouse stem cell antigens.34-36 Second, it has been
observed that rabbits elicit strong immune responses against
small molecules and haptens, which is uncommon in rodents.18,37-41 A third important aspect is the scarcity of inbred rabbit strains, while most mouse strains are inbred.1,42
It is thought that inbred strains in general elicit less diverse immune responses, which makes it more difficult to

raise strong and diverse binders.18 Correspondingly, in many IHC studies that compared rabbit and mouse mAbs to the same human antigens, rabbit mAbs consistently revealed higher sensitivity.43-62 In a recent study,63 1410 rabbit mAbs raised against 15-amino-acid peptides representing 100 different antigens revealed a typical affinity range of 20-200 pM (median 66 pM), as determined by high-throughput surface plasmon resonance. A fraction of rabbit mAbs even revealed higher affinities near the detection limit of 1 pM. However, the affinity range of 46 mouse mAbs (30-300 pM; median 72 pM) analyzed in parallel was not significantly different.63 More direct comparisons of rabbit and mouse mAbs to a wider variety of antigens are warranted to determine a significant difference in affinity. Fourth, most strategies to generate mAbs are based on the recovery of B cells from spleen, bone marrow or blood, which are present in higher quantities in rabbits than in mice due to their overall larger body size. (The average body weight of a 3-month-old laboratory rabbit is 2.5 kg compared to 25 g for a 6-week-old laboratory mouse.) For example, 50 times more spleen B cells can be recovered from rabbits compared to mice.18 In addition, the larger blood volume of rabbits compared to mice facilitates mass spectrometry analyses of bulk serum IgG.64 Fifth, as discussed in the next section, rabbits use different mechanisms to genetically generate and diversify their primary and secondary antibody repertoires compared to humans and mice, effectively creating a complementary set of binders for the discussed applications. The recent sequencing and annotation of the rabbit genome (OryCun2.0 assembly) has provided new insights into this unique antibody repertoire.1,65,66
ONTOGENY OF RABBIT B-CELL AND ANTIBODY REPERTOIRES The development of the rabbit B-cell repertoire significantly differs from that of other mammals. The current model proposes a three-step process (Figure 3) consisting of the neonatal B-cell repertoire generated by B lymphopoiesis in the fetal liver and omentum switching to bone marrow after birth, the primary `pre-immune' B-cell repertoire evolving during the first 2 months after birth in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and the secondary `immune' B-cell repertoire generated upon B-cell activation by immunogen binding.2,67 The neonatal B-cell repertoire starts developing between the second and third week of gestation.68,69 Interestingly, B lymphopoiesis is very limited in the bone marrow of adult rabbits,70 indicating that B lymphopoiesis is mainly restricted to early development. However, B cells with germline antibody sequences were found in the adult spleen.71 In addition, in a rabbit-to-rabbit adoptive transfer model, it was shown that rabbit B cells were able to engraft into host stem cell niches,72 which led to the conclusion that rabbit B cells are long-lived and potentially self-renewing and may thus sustain the rabbit antibody repertoire throughout a rabbit's lifetime.73
Rabbits mainly rearrange their heavy chains first followed by their light chains74 and thus follow the primary B-cell development pathway proposed by Ehlich et al.75 In brief, this

model proposes the VH-D-JH recombination of the heavy chain, followed by its expression as a pre-B-cell receptor. Upon stimulation of the pre-B-cell receptor, VL-JL light-chain recombination is started. Some evidence for non-templated nucleotide-addition (also known as N-nucleotides) has been observed in rabbit V-J rearrangements in 1-day-old rabbits, suggesting that terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was recently expressed.76
Although a potential pool of 200 VH genes are present for heavy-chain rearrangement,66,77 a majority of these are infrequently or not expressed.78 There are 10-20 D genes and 4-5 JH genes.79 However, it is known that certain genes from these clusters are preferentially utilized: VH1, the most D-proximal VH gene, is present in 80-90% of all heavychain gene rearrangements.68,79,80 Three different allotypes VHa1, VHa2 and VHa3 are known, resulting in the VHa-positive serotype.81,82 The remaining 10-20% of heavy chains contain VHx, VHy or VHz genes.83,84 This finding was somewhat surprising, because there is another functional, D-proximal VH sequence significantly closer to the VH1 segment. Indeed, it could be shown that the VH4 segment is utilized in 80-90% of the heavy-chain rearrangements in VH1-negative Alicia strain rabbits. However, this heavy-chain rearrangement was very rare in adult rabbits, suggesting that the VH4 rearrangement is non-productive in most cases and thus lost in the course of development.69 Lanning et al.73 suggested negative self-antigen effects and non-efficient pairing with light chains and surrogate light chains during B-cell development as possible reasons. In addition, preferential utilization of D2a, D2b and D1 as well as JH4 could be shown.79
It is thought that rabbits compensate for this preferential utilization of certain VH, D and JH genes in part by N-nucleotide addition at the VH-D and D-JH junctions during recombination.68,69 Using high-throughput sequencing of antibody repertoires from three New Zealand White rabbits, Lavinder et al.85 determined that the mean ± s.d. length of the third complementarity-determining region (CDR) of the heavy chain, which is known as HCDR3, includes both junctions, and thus is the most hypervariable of all six CDRs, is 15 ± 4 (mode = 13) amino acids compared to mouse and

human HCDR3s with mean ± s.d. lengths of 11 ± 2 (mode = 10 amino acids) and 15 ± 4 (mode = 15) amino acids, respectively. These findings confirmed that rabbit HCDR3s share more
similarity with human HCDR3s than mouse HCDR3s and could be relevant for therapeutic applications.86
Although there is limited heavy-chain usage in the neonatal rabbits' B-cell repertoire, there may be compensation by usage
of diverse light chains. There are two types of rabbit light chains-- and --with the  light chain present in two different isotypes called K1 and K2.87 Four K1 -light-chain allotypes--b4, b5, b6 and b9--have been observed in domes-
ticated rabbits. Notably, the constant domain sequences of these rabbit -light-chain allotypes have much higher amino-
acid sequence diversity than human Ig allotypes with pairwise amino-acid sequence differences of up to 40%.88 This high
degree of polymorphism exceeds the allotypic diversity of the
three heavy-chain allotypes, a1, a2 and a3 (~20% amino-acid
sequence differences), and even surpasses the allotypic diversity of major histocompatibility complex loci.1 K1 is by far the most
abundant isotype and represents between 70 and 90% of
all light chains, whereas the rest is usually a mixture of both K2 and -light chains.89 Many K1 light chains are characterized by an intrachain disulfide bridge between cysteine 80 in V and cysteine 171 in C (Figure 2).90 This additional disulfide bridge, which was discovered biochemically91,92 and later confirmed by X-ray crystallography,93,94 is not found in human
or mouse light chains. It may contribute to the stability
of rabbit antibodies and is one of many peculiarities of Ig evolution in vertebrates. This disulfide bridge is absent from
rabbits of the K1-negative Basilea mutant strain that only expresses K2 and -light chains. Some but not all of the K1 light chains of rabbits homozygous for the b9 -light-chain allotype86 have a cysteine 108 in J that is thought to create an alternative intrachain disulfide bridge with cysteine 171 in C.89,90 These allotypes play an important role for the
generation of rabbit mAbs by phage display and are discussed in more detail below. So far, ~ 50 functional V genes have been identified.76,95 Recently, using next-generation sequencing of rabbit antibody repertoires, Kodangattil et al.96 demonstrated that light-chain rearrangements are significantly more
diverse than heavy-chain rearrangements in rabbits. In addi-
tion, the imprecise junction of VL and JL genes in rabbits
encompasses particularly long stretches of N-nucleotides, resulting in, on average, longer LCDR3s (12 ± 2 amino acids; mode = 12) compared to mouse and human (9 ± 1 amino acids; mode = 9; Figure 4).85 The longer rabbit LCDR3s are occasionally stabilized by disulfide bridges.97 Taken together, by
generating a more diverse neonatal light-chain repertoire followed by a comparable degree of further diversification into
primary and secondary light-chain repertoires, the light chain
can compensate for the limited diversity of heavy-chain
repertoires in rabbits. This may also explain the dominance
of the rabbit light chain in general and LCDR3 in particular in
several of the antibody/antigen complexes for which three-
dimensional structures have been determined by X-ray crystallography.94,97-100

The limited neonatal antibody repertoire is further diversified between week 4 and 8 after birth resulting in the primary antibody repertoire.67 This postnatal diversification is an
unusual phenomenon and has so far only been observed in rabbits and pigs.101 The two main mechanisms are somatic
gene conversion (SGC; templated) and somatic hypermutation
(SHM; non-templated; Figures 3 and 4). SGC, predominantly used only in chicken and rabbit Ig gene diversification,102
leads to the replacement of large nucleic acid sequence stretches with DNA fragments from non-utilized VH genes.80,103,104 High-throughput sequencing revealed a mean ± s.d. tract lengths of 59 ± 36 nucleotides.85 Thus, the non-expressible
majority of VH genes play an important role for heavy-chain diversification. The predominance of this mechanism in rabbit
(23%) compared to human (2.5%) and mouse (0.1%) heavy chains, as determined by high-throughput sequencing,85 is
thought to lead to decreased wastage: a substantial portion of VH-D-JH recombinations with N-nucleotides addition have
out-of-frame junctions, whereas SGC, a homologous DNA recombination event,105 tends to favor in-frame substitutions and extensions.89 In addition, SHM is observed at considerable levels during this developmental stage.83,106,107 Following
rearrangement in the neonatal B-cell repertoire, rabbit light-
chain genes also undergo SGC and SHM to diversify the primary B-cell repertoire (Figures 3 and 4).108 Further
corroborating the importance of the light chain for generating
diversity in rabbit antibody repertoires, SGC is more frequent (32%) and has a longer mean ± s.d. tract length (86 ± 48 nucleotides) in rabbit -light chains compared to rabbit heavy chains.85
Interestingly, the generation of the primary repertoire is
highly GALT-dependent. In short, GALT involves the uptake
of pathogens from the gastrointestinal track by specialized
epithelial cells known as M cells and the presentation of antigens to B cells leading to B-cell stimulation, diversification and proliferation.109 Surgical removal110 of GALT tissues, such as the Peyer's patches in the small intestines, the sacculus rotundus and the appendix111 resulted in severely immunodeficient rabbits. In addition, it was observed that germ-free rabbits developed abnormal GALT.112,113 Lanning et al.114 demonstrated that this directly correlated with reduced somatic VH-D-JH diversification compared to
germ-exposed rabbits.
The secondary B-cell repertoire is generated upon antigen-
dependent B-cell stimulation. Again, additional diversity is
introduced by SGC and SHM in both heavy and light chains (Figures 3 and 4).115,116 These events further broaden the B-cell
repertoire directed against a certain set of antigens associated with a specific pathogen.73
The discussed idiotypic and allotypic peculiarities of rabbit
antibodies further extend to the isotype. Notably, rabbits only have one IgG isotype (one C gene) compared to four
IgG isotypes in mice (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3) and
humans (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4). In contrast, rabbits have 13 C genes giving rise to at least 10 functional IgA isotypes, the most diverse IgA system known,1,117 compared to just one

GENERATION OF RABBIT MABS Hybridoma technology The discovery and development of hybridoma technology for the generation of mAbs by Georges Köhler and César Milstein in 1975 has had a huge impact on biomedical research and its application to modern medicine.118,119 Hybridoma technology is a method to generate stable cell lines that constantly secret a defined mAb. For this purpose, B cells derived from an immunized animal are fused with a myeloma cell line in the presence of polyethylene glycol. The hybridomas generated this way are cloned by limiting dilution, screened for favorable mAb characteristics and then expanded in culture to obtain high amounts of the desired mAb.119 Generally, two hybridoma types can be distinguished: first, homo-hybridomas where both host B cells and fusion cell line emerged from the same species and, second, hetero-hybridomas derived from two different species.120
Ever since their initial discovery, multiple aspects of the general technique have been modified in order to avoid certain problems related to fusion efficiency, hybridoma stability and mAb titers.121 Hybridoma technology has been used extensively to generate thousands of different mAbs against a wide variety of antigens. In fact, the majority of FDA-approved chimeric, humanized and human mAbs originate from hybridoma technology.120 However, all of these were derived from mouse B cells or transgenic mouse B cells with human Ig genes. Due to the favorable properties of rabbit antibodies, many

groups tried to develop methods for the generation of rabbit hybridomas. This endeavor was significantly complicated by the absence of rabbit myeloma cell lines.122 Viral transforma-
tion of rabbit B cells to generate myeloma-like cell lines also proved to be difficult and rather inefficient.123 For these reasons, substantial efforts focused on generating rabbit-mouse hetero-hybridomas. Unfortunately, all hetero-hybridomas generated in the early days of hybridoma technology revealed poor fusion efficiency, genetic instability and impaired functional rabbit heavy- and light-chain pairings.124-126 In 1988, Raybould et al.122 generated the first stable rabbit-mouse hetero-hybridoma by polyethylene glycol-mediated fusion
of rabbit spleen B cells with the mouse myeloma cell
line SP2/0-Ag14. Even though they observed stable rabbit
IgG expression for several months, other groups observed genetic instability and concomitant decrease of mAb secretion.
These shortcomings could be partially addressed by extensive efforts to regularly subclone the rabbit-mouse heterohybridoma.127 The first rabbit homo-hybridoma was developed in 1995 in the laboratory of Katherine Knight.128 In order to
obtain a potential rabbit fusion cell line, transgenic rabbits were
generated by single-cell zygote microinjection and mated to
generate v-abl/c-myc double transgenic rabbits. This method led to the discovery of the first stable rabbit plasmacytoma cell line, 240E-1,129 which could be used as an efficient fusion partner to generate rabbit homo-hybridomas. Interestingly, Spieker-Polet et al. also showed in this publication that B cells
derived from different rabbit tissues led to the generation of
hybridomas secreting different ratios of IgG, IgM and IgA.
However, the stability of the obtained homo-hybridomas was
still a major concern and IgG secretion decreased over time. Although this decay is frequently also observed for mouse
homo-hybridomas, it appeared to be more drastic in the case of rabbit homo-hybridomas.30,130 For this reason, Zhu and Pytela121 attempted to further improve the initial 240E-1 cell
line by iterative subcloning to screen for clones with higher fusion efficiency, yielding hybridomas with higher genetic stability and more stable rabbit IgG secretion. The obtained
fusion cell line 240E-W and its successors 240E-W2 and 240W3, which are characterized by higher fusion efficiency and the absence of endogenous rabbit heavy- and light-chain secretion (US Patent 7,429,487),41 are part of the proprietary RabMab
platform of Epitomics, Inc. (now Abcam, Inc.) and were used
to generate the therapeutic rabbit mAbs sevacizumab and
APX005M discussed above.
Aside from therapeutic applications, rabbit mAbs generated
by hybridoma technology have become highly valuable reagents for diagnostic applications and for laboratory research. For example, highly specific rabbit mAbs can detect activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR by IHC of lung cancer tissues.131 Rabbit mAbs are also suitable to detect post-translational modifications.132,133 Further, rabbit mAbs against the HIV-1 protein gp120 were
shown to mimic neutralizing human anti-HIV-1 gp120 mAbs,
promoting rabbit immunization as model for HIV-1 vaccine development.94,134-136

Phage display technology Bacteriophage, also simply known as phage, are viruses that infect and replicate within bacteria. Phage display was invented by George Smith, who discovered that the minor coat protein (pIII) of filamentous phage can be modified at its amino terminus to present peptide sequences without affecting phage
infectivity. In addition, these phage particles contained the genomic information encoding the respectively modified coat protein, thus physically linking genotype and phenotype. A combination of phage selection and amplification could be used to efficiently enrich phage that contained certain peptide sequences.137 However, the incorporation of larger peptide sequences, protein domains or whole proteins represented a serious challenge due to decreasing infectivity. For this reason, two-component systems were developed that consisted of a phagemid encoding the pIII fusion protein and a helper
phage contributing the phage genome to encode all proteins necessary for generating infectious phage particles. Usually, these helper phage contain a modified packaging signal, leading to the preferential assembly of phage particles containing the phagemid. In the early 1990s, the first filamentous phage display antibody libraries based on pIII fusion proteins were published using either scFv or Fab fragments.138,139 To date, these formats are still dominating the selection of mAbs by phage display.140-142
Although phage display was established with mouse and human antibody libraries to mine immune, naive and synthetic antibody repertoires,120,141 the fact that rabbit mAbs were difficult to generate by hybridoma technology for a number of years provided a strong incentive for exploring the accessibility of rabbit immune antibody repertoires by phage display. The first rabbit antibody library selected by phage display was reported by Ridder et al.,143 using a scFv format as in subsequent independent studies.39,40,144-151 Rabbit antibody libraries in Fab format followed in short succession.152,153 Due to the higher expression levels of human compared to rabbit constant domains in bacteria, a chimeric rabbit/human
Fab format consisting of rabbit variable domains VL and VH recombinantly fused to human constant domains CL and CH1, respectively, proved particularly successful for the selection of rabbit mAbs by phage display19,154-160 and their subsequent humanization (Figure 5).155 However, the abovediscussed intrachain disulfide bridge between cysteine 80 and cysteine 171 found in rabbit  light chains of the dominating K1 isotype posed a challenge to the chimeric rabbit/human Fab format as human CH1 does not harbor a cysteine 171. In
fact, only few Fab originating from the K1 isotype were selected,86,155 indicating that the free thiol group of cysteine 80 is disfavored and that its presence diminishes the selectable diversity of chimeric rabbit/human Fab. Indeed, chimeric rabbit/human Fab derived by phage display from immunized
K1-negative Basilea strain rabbits revealed higher sequence diversity and higher affinity compared to those from K1-positive New Zealand White strain rabbits immunized with the same immunogens.86 Interestingly, the same study by Popkov et al. also compared rabbits homozygous for the

Top: in contrast to rabbit Fab, chimeric rabbit/human Fab, which consist of rabbit variable domains (blue and orange) and human constant domains (gray and white), are well expressed in Escherichia coli and displayed on phage. The phage particle shown displays one chimeric rabbit/human Fab copy linked to the phage surface by the C-terminal pIII protein domain as its phenotype and, as its genotype, contain the corresponding single-stranded phagemid that encodes the Fab. This physical linkage of phenotype and genotype is the essence of phage display. Bottom: following selection by phage display, chimeric rabbit/human Fab can be humanized, which typically involves the grafting of the six rabbit CDRs (blue and orange) into human framework regions (gray and white).
b9 -light-chain allotype (Figure 1) with the presumed alternative intrachain disulfide bridge between cysteine 108 and cysteine 171. Fusion of the rabbit V and human C encoding sequences in the generation of the chimeric rabbit/human Fab library removes cysteine 108, thus avoiding the exposure of a free thiol group. Consequently, immunized b9 allotype rabbits also revealed superior selectable diversity and were subsequently used in several additional studies.21,32,161 These include the generation of a chimeric rabbit/human Fab against the HIV-1 protein Rev.99 The Fab was able to invert Rev polymerization and allowed for the formation of Fab-Rev co-crystals that could be analyzed with X-ray crystallography providing the first three-dimensional structure of Rev and the first three-dimensional structure of a rabbit mAb.98 Notably, the crystal structure revealed a dominant role for LCDR3 in the antigen-binding site (Figure 6). A cyclic peptide derived from LCDR3 was shown to bind HIV-1 Rev with high affinity and to potently inhibit Rev polymerization,162 corroborating the functional importance of the above-discussed high sequence diversity of rabbit light chains.
A key advantage of using the natural Fab format for phage display is its robust monomeric nature that permits affinitydriven selections.142 By contrast, the unnatural scFv format has a tendency to dimerize, trimerize and tetramerize,163,164 potentially causing avidity-driven selections.141 Thus, we

recommend using chimeric rabbit/human Fab format-based phage display for applications that require rabbit mAbs of high affinity. Even if the application calls for scFv, such as for the generation of intrabodies, the chimeric rabbit/human Fab format has been used for selection by phage display followed by conversion to the rabbit scFv format.160,165-167 In addition to Fab and scFv formats, single-domain antibody formats, that is, VL or VH alone, which due to their smaller sizes have advantages for certain applications, such as the recognition of cryptic epitopes,163 have also been engineered from rabbit mAbs.168-170 The noted dominance of the rabbit light chain may make phage display of rabbit VL libraries particularly attractive.
Alternative methods As discussed, hybridoma technology and phage display have distinct virtues and shortcomings that have fueled the development of alternative techniques to generate mAbs. Unlike hybridoma technology, phage display relies on the proper transcription, translation, folding and assembly of light and heavy chains in bacteria. Also, a potential disadvantage of phage display, as well as other display technologies, is their combinatorial nature, leading to the random pairing of light and heavy chains.120 As discussed above, limiting factors encountered during hybridoma technology, at least initially, included fusion efficiency and hybridoma stability.130,171 Also, unlike mouse hybridoma technology, rabbit hybridoma technology was patented, imposing intellectual property restrictions that have contributed to the incentive of developing alternative methods.

In the generation of human mAbs, prominent alternative methods include the clonal expansion of B cells by, for example, Epstein-Barr virus immortalization, and single B-cell sorting followed by light- and heavy-chain-encoding DNA amplification and sequencing.120 Notably, like hybridoma technology but unlike phage display, both methods yield natural light- and heavy-chain pairs. Single B-cell isolation based on antigen capture by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, magnetic beads, solid-phase panning or hemolytic plaques followed by light- and heavy-chain cloning has also been applied to the generation of rabbit mAbs from peripheral B cells,172-176 which does not require killing of the animal and allows for multiple sampling points from primary and secondary lymphoid tissues.177 Antigen capture-driven bulk spleen B-cell isolation from immunized rabbits followed by light- and heavy-chain-encoding DNA amplification and their combinatorial assembly and expression in scFv-Fc or IgG format in mammalian cells has also been reported.178 In the fluorescent foci method, plasma cells from rabbit bone marrow are identified by fluorescent microscopy, isolated and subjected to light- and heavy-chain-encoding DNA amplification and sequencing.179
High-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have been applied to the in silico generation of mAbs as well as to the analysis of naive and immune antibody repertoires in different species.180 In the rabbit, high-throughput DNA sequencing of B-cell repertoires along with mass spectrometry analysis of bulk serum IgG has been used for the deconvolution of mAbs.64,181 Interestingly, this method revealed that the serum IgG response to an invertebrate protein following hyperimmunization was oligoclonal rather than polyclonal, comprising 34 rabbit mAbs belonging to 30 distinct clonotypes.64
HUMANIZATION OF RABBIT MABS
The human immune system is intended to recognize and selectively remove potentially pathogenic organisms and substances. This is also true for nonhuman proteins, such as mouse and rabbit mAbs. The respective immune responses are characterized by high titers of human antibodies directed against these foreign antibody sequences.182 This has two main physiological consequences; first of all, it leads to side effects comparable to allergic reactions of different levels of severity and, second, it leads to the rapid elimination of the administered mAb, thus limiting its diagnostic or therapeutic efficacy.183,184 For these reasons, nonhuman mAbs are now routinely converted to chimeric mAbs by combining the nonhuman variable domains with human constant domains185 and further to humanized mAbs by grafting all or some of the CDRs of the nonhuman variable domains into human frameworks.186
The first chimeric and humanized rabbit mAbs were reported by Rader et al.155 In this study, chimeric rabbit/ human Fab selected by phage display were humanized by grafting the six rabbit CDRs, three from each light and heavy chain, into human frameworks that were diversified at certain positions to allow the selection of either human or rabbit

residues by phage display. The resulting humanized rabbit mAbs retained the high affinity and specificity of their parental mAbs. As discussed above, aside from having higher utility for downstream clinical applications, using chimeric rabbit/human Fab format for phage display has the added advantage of affording higher expression levels in bacteria and, concomitantly, higher display levels on phage.155
Since this first report, a number of additional humanized rabbit mAbs have been published and patented. In general, humanization strategies that have worked for mouse mAbs also work for rabbit mAbs, whether it is by rational design,17,33,187 directed evolution188 or a combination of both.155,189 As is the case for mouse mAbs, grafting of all six CDRs followed by iterative fine-tuning of framework residues is the most frequently used method for humanizing rabbit mAbs. Borras et al. used a general acceptor framework for the humanization of rabbit scFv. In this study, a certain human framework carrying five specific human-to-rabbit mutations was able to generate humanized rabbit mAbs to two different antigens with conserved affinities and specificities, and improved biophysical properties.24 Humanization strategies that confine the content of parental rabbit antibody sequences only to the most hypervariable of the CDRs, such as LCDR3 and HCDR3,190 have also been successfully applied to rabbit mAbs.188
Thus far, there have been no reports that analyze the immunogenicity of clinically investigated humanized rabbit mAbs. Recent studies indicate that patients can still mount an immune response to humanized or even fully human mAbs. These findings indicate that additional aspects, such as idiotype, allotype, glycosylation and aggregation, contribute to the immunogenicity of mAbs.191 Nonetheless, the occurrence of these unwanted side effects is significantly lower than previously observed for nonhuman antibodies.182
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Driven by the success of rabbit pAbs on one hand and mouse mAbs on the other hand, rabbit mAbs have become highly successful reagents for laboratory research and for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. The unique ontogeny of rabbit B cells affords highly distinctive antibody repertoires rich in in vivo pruned binders of high diversity, affinity and specificity. The ability to access rabbit antibody repertoires by hybridoma technology, phage display and alternative methods has fueled the increased use of rabbit mAbs in many different applications. Rabbit mAbs generated by hybridoma technology are particularly attractive for IHC, with many studies demonstrating higher sensitivity compared to benchmark mouse mAbs. Rabbit mAbs generated by phage display have found the use for applications ranging from the detection of uranium in water40 to chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy of cancer.22 Given that humanization strategies are now well established, the therapeutic utility of rabbit mAbs is especially intriguing. With the first rabbit mAb-derived therapeutics already in clinical trials, we predict that rabbit mAbs will gain further traction in preclinical and clinical pipelines over the next decade.

ABSTRACT Quadriceps muscle phenotype varies widely between patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cannot be determined without muscle biopsy. We hypothesised that measures of skeletal muscle adiposity could provide noninvasive biomarkers of muscle quality in this population.
In 101 patients and 10 age-matched healthy controls, mid-thigh cross-sectional area, percentage intramuscular fat and skeletal muscle attenuation were calculated using computed tomography images and standard tissue attenuation ranges: fat -190- -30 HU; skeletal muscle -29-150 HU.
Mean¡SD percentage intramuscular fat was higher in the patient group (6.7¡3.5% versus 4.3¡1.2%, p50.03). Both percentage intramuscular fat and skeletal muscle attenuation were associated with physical activity level, exercise capacity and type I fibre proportion, independent of age, mid-thigh cross-sectional area and quadriceps strength. Combined with transfer factor of the lung for carbon monoxide, these variables could identify .80% of patients with fibre type shift with .65% specificity (area under the curve 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.95).
Skeletal muscle adiposity assessed by computed tomography reflects multiple aspects of COPD related muscle dysfunction and may help to identify patients for trials of interventions targeted at specific muscle phenotypes.

Introduction Skeletal muscle dysfunction is an important complication of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occurring in mild as well as more advanced disease [1, 2]. It is largely driven by physical inactivity and is most apparent in muscles of the lower limb, in particular the quadriceps [3, 4]. Quadriceps weakness is associated with reduced exercise performance [5], poor health status [6], increased healthcare utilisation [7] and mortality, independent of airflow obstruction [8]. Changes in the quadriceps include muscle atrophy, loss of strength and endurance [9, 10], and a shift towards a less aerobic phenotype with reduced type I fibre proportions, capillarity and oxidative enzymes [11, 12]. The degree and nature of impairment varies widely between patients and cannot currently be predicted accurately without muscle biopsy [13]. The need for biomarkers of muscle phenotype has recently been highlighted, underscored by the prospect of new pharmacotherapies that selectively target certain muscle characteristics [14]. For example, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-d agonists or 59 AMP-activated protein kinase activators, which change the fuel preference within skeletal muscle away from glycolysis towards fat oxidation.
Computed tomography (CT) is an established method to assess muscle mass or quantity [15]. Images can also be analysed to assess muscle quality by the level of fatty infiltration of muscle, or muscle adiposity. Skeletal muscle adiposity increases with age [16] and, independent of mass, is associated with muscle triglyceride content [17], oxidative capacity [18], insulin resistance [19], muscle strength and power [20, 21], as well as immobility and hip fracture [22, 23]. Little is known about muscle adiposity in patients with COPD, but given the above, we predicted that CT-based measures could be valuable biomarkers of muscle phenotype in this group. In particular, their use may help identify patients with type I to type II muscle fibre shift as candidates for trials of targeted therapies. In this study, we hypothesised that mid-thigh intramuscular fat and muscle attenuation would be associated with physical activity, exercise capacity and fibre shift.
Methods Study design and subjects Data were collated from patients with a diagnosis of COPD consistent with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria [24] who had previously participated in two clinical studies at the Royal Brompton, King's College or St Thomas' Hospitals (London, UK). Some of the phenotypic data for some of these patients has been previously reported [6, 25]. Exclusion criteria were: diagnoses of heart, renal or liver failure; systemic inflammatory, metabolic or neuromuscular disorders; warfarin (bleeding risk from biopsy); or an exacerbation within the preceding 4 weeks. Healthy age-matched controls with no history or symptoms of respiratory or cardiovascular disease, or unresolved musculoskeletal injury were recruited by local advertisement. All participants had provided written informed consent for studies approved by the Joint University College London Committees on the Ethics of Human Research (Committee Alpha) and the Ethics Committee of the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust.
Mid-thigh composition CT was performed on a 64-slice CT scanner (SOMATOM Sensation 64; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with the patient in a supine position. A single section of both mid-thighs, at a predefined level, was obtained using the following acquisition parameters: 50 mA?s and 120 kVp. The protocol was modified to deliver a reduced amount of radiation per scan. Images were viewed and analysed using SliceOMatic software (version 4.3; TomoVision, Magog, QC, Canada).
Skeletal muscle and intramuscular fat were identified and quantified by use of standard Hounsfield unit thresholds, which represent the physical properties of tissues expressed in numerical form (skeletal muscle -29-150 HU; intramuscular fat -190- -30 HU) [26]. By specifying Hounsfield unit range, the software filters by tissue type and allows each to be quantified in turn. Tissue perimeters can be altered manually where necessary (fig. 1). Intramuscular fat was normalised to mid-thigh cross-sectional area (MTCSA) and expressed as a percentage. Skeletal muscle attenuation was measured using the mean radiation attenuation in Hounsfield units, which reflects macroscopic fatty muscle infiltration. A lower mean indicates less attenuation and greater fat infiltration. These methods are highly reliable with reported intra- and interclass coefficients of variation between 0.2% and 4.8% [27, 28].
Additional measurements Lung volumes, transfer factor of the lung for carbon monoxide (TLCO), fat mass and fat free mass index (FFMI), daily step count and physical activity level (PAL), quadriceps maximum voluntary contraction (QMVC) and twitch tension, vastus lateralis fibre type and shift, exercise capacity as assessed by incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) or 6-min walking distance (6MWD), and health-related quality of life were assessed as described previously [6, 25] and in the online supplementary material.

FIGURE 1 Mid-thigh compositional analysis based on a single slice computed tomography image. Tissues were differentiated according to standardised Hounsfield unit thresholds; skeletal muscle (red) -29-150 HU, adipose tissue (green) -190- -30 HU.
Statistical analysis Normally distributed continuous data are presented as mean¡SD. Between-group comparisons were performed using unpaired t-test, Chi-squared tests or one-way ANOVA, as appropriate. Associations between measures of skeletal muscle adiposity and other variables were analysed using Pearson's correlation coefficients, and univariate and multivariate linear regression models incorporating age, MTCSA, QMVC and TLCO % predicted as independent variables. For receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, percentage intramuscular fat and skeletal muscle attenuation were used alone or in combination to discriminate subjects according to the presence of fibre shift. Statistical analysis and graphical presentations were performed using SPSS version 19 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diago, CA, USA), respectively. No attempt at imputation of missing data was made. A p-value of ,0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.
Results Subjects CT data were available for 111 subjects: 101 COPD patients and 10 healthy age-matched controls (table 1). Consistent with a diagnosis of COPD, patients had impaired lung function and reduced arterial blood oxygen tension compared with controls. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index, FFMI or arterial blood carbon dioxide tension between the patient and healthy control groups, but patients had significantly reduced quadriceps strength, and mid-thigh and lean tissue cross-sectional area (table 1).
Percentage intramuscular fat was significantly elevated in patients with COPD compared with healthy controls, with mean¡SD values of 6.6¡3.3% and 4.3¡1.2%, respectively (p50.03). In the patient group,

values stratified by GOLD stage revealed that fat infiltration tended to be greater in those with advanced disease, although the between group differences were not significant (GOLD I/II/III/IV 5.0¡0.5/5.9¡0.5/ 7.9¡0.7/6.4¡0.5%) (table 1). Skeletal muscle attenuation was numerically, but not significantly, different between patient and control groups (table 1), and was significantly reduced in the patients with most fat infiltration (table 2).
Reproducibility For all measures based on a standard CT image, the mean differences between two researchers, or repeat assessments by the same researcher were less than 1% of the mean value for both assessments. The lower 95% confidence intervals of correlation coefficients for all assessments exceeded 0.99 and can be interpreted as excellent (tables S1a and S1b). A subset of 29 patients had an additional CT scan following 3 months participation in the placebo arm of a clinical trial. Overall, repeat assessments demonstrated good reproducibility with all lower 95% confidence intervals of correlation coefficients exceeding 0.70 (table S1c).
Skeletal muscle adiposity and physical activity Percentage intramuscular fat was negatively correlated with step count (r5 -0.27, p50.03) and PAL (r5 -0.35, p50.003) (fig. 2), although only PAL was significantly reduced in patients in the upper compared with the lower quartile of this measure (p50.04) (table 2). In a regression model, percentage intramuscular fat was significantly associated with step count (b coefficient¡SE -258¡121, p50.04) and PAL (b¡SE -0.02¡0.01, p50.007) independent of age, MTCSA and QMVC, but not TLCO % pred.
Skeletal muscle attenuation was positively correlated with step count (r50.36, p50.003) and PAL (r50.35, p50.004) (fig. 2) and was significantly associated with these variables independent of age, MTCSA and QMVC, but not TLCO % pred (step count b¡SE 206¡100, p50.02; PAL b¡SE 0.13¡0.01, p50.008).
Skeletal muscle adiposity and exercise capacity Percentage intramuscular fat was negatively correlated with ISWT (r5 -0.45, p,0.001), and 6MWD when analysed with (r5 -0.49, p50.001) and without (r5 -0.42, p50.02) control subjects (fig. 3). ISWT and 6MWD were significantly reduced among patients in the upper quartile of percentage intramuscular fat compared with those in the lower quartile (table 2). Percentage intramuscular fat was significantly associated with ISWT (b¡SE -16.0¡4.5, p,0.001) and 6MWD (b¡SE -19.5¡6.2, p50.004) independent of age, MTCSA, QMVC and TLCO % pred.
Skeletal muscle attenuation was positively correlated with ISWT distance (r50.37, p50.002) and 6MWD when analysed with (r50.57, p50.001) or without (r50.60, p50.001) control subjects (fig. 3), and was significantly associated with exercise performance independent of age, MTCSA, QMVC and TLCO % pred (ISWT b¡SE 9.8¡3.8, p50.001; 6MWD b¡SE 12.7¡3.8, p50.002).
Skeletal muscle adiposity and fibre shift Percentage intramuscular fat was negatively correlated with the percentage of type I fibres when analysed with (r5 -0.36, p50.006) and without (r5 -0.27, p50.05) control subjects (fig. S1). Percentage of type I fibres was not significantly different between patients in the upper and lower quartile of percentage intramuscular fat, but percentage of type IIx fibres was significantly greater in patients with most fat infiltration (21.8¡18.4% versus 8.4¡8.7%, p50.04). Percentage intramuscular fat was independently associated with percentage of type I fibres when considered with age, MTCSA and QMVC, but not TLCO % pred (b¡SE -1.3¡0.6, p50.04). In a similar analysis, skeletal muscle attenuation was positively correlated with percentage of type I fibres (r50.30, p50.02) (fig. S1b) but was not independently associated when the other factors were considered.
To determine whether measures of skeletal muscle adiposity could predict fibre shift, a ROC analysis was performed with fibre shift, defined as percentage of type I fibres f27%, as the dependent variable. TLCO % pred was a stronger predictor of fibre shift than percentage intramuscular fat and skeletal muscle attenuation, with area under the curve (AUC) values (95% CI) of 0.825 (0.709-0.940) and 0.648 (0.7494-0.802), respectively (fig. 4). Combining measures of skeletal muscle adiposity with TLCO % pred, the AUC increased to 0.833 (fig. 4). The curve profile also changed such that, with a greater emphasis on sensitivity than specificity, measures of skeletal muscle adiposity could be used with TLCO % pred to identify .80% of patients with fibre shift with .65% specificity (fig. 4).
Skeletal muscle adiposity and COPD characteristics Neither percentage intramuscular fat nor skeletal muscle attenuation were significantly associated with sex, body mass index, FFMI, MTCSA or QMVC. The latter measures were not as consistently related to physical activity, exercise capacity or fibre shift as measures of skeletal muscle adiposity (table S2). Percentage

Discussion We have investigated CT-based measures of skeletal muscle adiposity in patients with COPD. Patients had a significantly elevated percentage of intramuscular fat compared with age-matched healthy controls. Moderate significant associations were found between percentage intramuscular fat and skeletal muscle attenuation, and measures of physical activity, exercise capacity and muscle fibre type independent of age, quadriceps strength and MTCSA. By combining measures of skeletal muscle adiposity with TLCO, .80% of subjects with quadriceps fibre shift could be identified with .65% specificity.

Significance of the findings Our findings extend knowledge regarding the extent and nature of quadriceps muscle dysfunction in COPD. Reductions in muscle mass, strength and endurance are well known phenomena, as are fibre shift and loss of oxidative capacity [8, 9, 13]. Abnormally high levels of lipids have also been observed microscopically in the quadriceps of patients with COPD both under the fascia [29] and within muscle fibres [30, 31].
Image-based measures of quadriceps muscle structure may help to identify patients with specific muscle phenotypes. Muscle biopsy data confirm that COPD muscle abnormalities are heterogeneous, unrelated to muscle strength and that, on average, only 50% of unselected patients will have pathological fibre shift or fibre atrophy [13]. For emerging pharmacotherapies that have fibre-type specific modes of action, such as those that affect the transcriptional coactivator [32] or stimulate fatty acid oxidation [33], practical biomarkers to identify relevant populations for study are desirable. Other biomarkers have been suggested for this purpose, including 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) [34] and plasma microRNA-1 [35]. CT measures are less expensive to undertake than 31P-MRS, and are likely to be more rapidly available and more stable than any biomarker based on blood analysis.
Our findings also support data suggesting that emphysema (evaluated here via TLCO) rather than airflow obstruction is the more closely associated with skeletal muscle abnormalities [36] and strength [37] than FEV1, although in this it differs from the review by GOSKER et al. [11], which found FEV1 was more strongly associated than TLCO at the study level. For study stratification, CT has the advantage that it can be scored centrally and is less patient- and operator-dependent than gas transfer measurement.
The accumulation of fat in the skeletal muscle of patients with COPD may reflect an intermediate between a type I to type II fibre shift and insulin resistance. Oxidative muscle fibres consume fats [38] and these results are consistent with the observation that transgenic animal models with an increased skeletal muscle oxidative fibre proportion have a reduced intramuscular triglyceride content, compared to wild-type

controls, when exposed to a high-fat diet [39]. In humans, type I to type II fibre shift is associated with both insulin resistance and obesity [40, 41], and intramuscular fat is associated with [42] and may exacerbate insulin resistance [43]. Fat within skeletal muscle may also reflect fat tissue elsewhere in the body exceeding its storage capacity and the subsequent release of fatty acids into the circulation. Thus, intramuscular fat may also facilitate a stratified medicine approach as a biomarker of insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk in COPD more generally. The former could be investigated by measures of fasting insulin levels, for example, skeletal muscle adiposity with euglycaemic insulin clamp studies [44], and the latter by prospective observation of cardiovascular events in patients with COPD whose levels of intramuscular fat are known.
Functional exercise performance was also associated with percentage intramuscular fat and skeletal muscle attenuation. Given the link between physical inactivity and muscle fibre shift, this probably reflects reduced quadriceps oxidative capacity and endurance, leading to early fatigue. This consolidates previous data in

which our group demonstrated patients with fibre shift had poorer exercise performance than those without, independent of differences in MTCSA and quadriceps strength [25].
Relationship to other work Two small studies have previously demonstrated greater levels of intramuscular fat in patients with COPD compared with healthy controls using CT and magnetic resonance imaging [45, 46]. Neither demonstrated an association between measures of skeletal muscle adiposity and functional performance. SHEILDS et al. [47] recently demonstrated increased intermuscular fat, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, in the quadriceps of patients with COPD compared with healthy controls (mean increase 32%). As in the present study, fat infiltration, but not muscle cross-sectional area, was associated with increased anaerobic metabolism during exercise and reduced exercise performance [47]. Bioenergetic changes were not observed in the biceps brachii despite patients having been selected on the basis of weakness in the quadriceps [47].
Critique of the method Interobserver and interoccasion agreement for measures of skeletal muscle adiposity based on a standard CT image were excellent, with narrower limits of agreement than those reported during measurement of rectus femoris cross-sectional area with ultrasound [48]. Studies using CT report coefficients of variation between 1.5% and 2.5% for tissue cross-sectional area and ,1% for muscle attenuation [49], with each HU increase equivalent to a 1% increase in lipid concentration when assessed microscopically [17]. Differences in serial measurements over 3 months in patients with stable COPD were also small and comparable to those found with CT-based measures of muscle or adipose cross-sectional area as confirmed by axial cadaver sections [50, 51]. The small measurement differences may be ascribed to operator error, particularly in the manual correction of tissue margins, which are required in the absence of a fully automated analysis procedure. Error relating to image acquisition should be minimal, particularly in comparison to other modalities that rely on surface land-marking, for example ultrasound. Nonetheless, the marginally greater differences between, as compared with within, observers underscores a need for training and standardisation of observers for longitudinal measurements.
Muscle biopsies were obtained in a large subset of subjects in this study. Samples were used for fibre typing, and to measure inflammatory markers and other mediators to fulfil the aims of primary studies. Unfortunately, insufficient tissue remained to stain for intermyocellular and intramyocellular fat deposition, which would have served as criterion measures to validate the CT-based measures as surrogate markers of muscle adiposity. Direct measures of intramyocellular fat and myofilament density, and other measures of muscle phenotype such as capillarisation, oxidative enzyme content and glucose handling, would be helpful to examine in this population.
Future longitudinal work should explore the accumulation and mechanisms of intramuscular fat, the responsiveness to change of these CT-based measurements and their ability to help predict clinical outcome, for example treatment response, risk of admission or cardiovascular events. In older adults, 12 weeks of high-intensity resistance training has been shown to increase quadriceps and hamstring muscle attenuation by 5.4% and 5.5%, respectively, with concurrent changes in strength and mass [52]. Skeletal muscle attenuation has also been used to predict community-based falls, hip fracture and functional mobility, independent of strength [22, 23].
Conclusion In conclusion, skeletal muscle adiposity assessed by CT imaging reflects important aspects of muscle dysfunction in patients with COPD and may help to identify patients with fibre shift. Future work should identify its responsiveness to intervention, both in proven therapies, for example exercise training, and with novel drugs where specific muscle phenotypes may be expected to respond differently.

Since the discovery that proteins mutated in different forms of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) are tightly associated with primary cilia, strong efforts have been made to define the role of this organelle in the pathogenesis of cyst formation. Cilia are filiform microtubular structures, anchored in the basal body and extending from the apical membrane into the tubular lumen. Early work established that cilia act as flow sensors, eliciting calcium transients in response to bending, which involve the two proteins mutated in autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD), polycystin-1 and -2. Loss of cilia alone is insufficient to cause cyst formation. Nevertheless, a large body of evidence links flow sensing by cilia to aspects relevant for cyst formation such as cell polarity, Stat6- and mammalian target of rapamycin signalling. This review summarizes the current literature on cilia and flow sensing with respect to PKD and discusses how these findings intercalate with different aspects of cyst formation.

been studied for several decades in unicellular organisms, particularly Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which yielded important insights into the physiology and biochemistry of this organelle, which are for the most part applicable also to primary, non-motile, cilia [3]. The reader is referred to a number of excellent reviews on the structure and function of cilia and its relevance with disease [4-6]. The link between polycystic kidneys and cilia became apparent when the mutated gene in the oakridge polycystic kidney (orpk) mouse was found to encode a family member of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins. IFT proteins are transported along microtubular rods within the cilium and are required for cilia formation and maintenance [7, 8]. Subsequently, several proteins mutated in human or murine PKD have been found to localize to cilia. They include cystin (cpk mouse), polycystin 1 and 2 (PC-1 and 2), encoded by Pkd1 and 2 and mutated in ADPKD (autosomal dominant PKD), fibrocystin mutated in ARPKD (autosomal recessive PKD) and nephrocystin and

inversin mutated in nephronophthisis [9-12]. This makes a

compelling argument that this organelle is at the centre of a

INTRODUCTION

unifying concept of cyst formation. The central role of cilia

A century passed by from the first description of primary cilia in mammalian tubular cells to the recognition that these microtubule-containing organelles protruding from the apical membrane of epithelial cells perform important functions [1]. For a long time, attention had focussed on motile cilia

was supported further when it was demonstrated that abolishing cilia through inactivation of a ciliary motor protein selectively in the kidney resulted in cyst formation [13].
Different forms of cystic kidneys vary by age of presentation [14]. ADPKD, the most common form with an incidence of 1:1000, is a disease of adulthood. Over half of the affected

patients require renal replacement therapy by the age of 60.

associated with pathologies in other organ systems such as situs inversus in nephronophthisis, retinitis pigmentosa in Joubert's disease, central nervous system malformations in Meckel syndrome, polydactyly in Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) or obesity in BBS and Almström syndrome [15]. For the majority of associated pathologies, a role for cilia in their aetiology has been characterized resulting in the term ciliopathies. In the kidney, cilia extend into the tubule lumen where they are bent by flow. Indeed, groundbreaking work by Praetorius and Spring revealed that the cilium translates fluid flow into calcium signals and thus, could serve as a signal transduction platform that orchestrates tubular development, epithelial cell homeostasis and the diameter of tubules [16, 17].
Cyst formation is characterized by multiple pathogenic events including disordered cell polarity, dysregulation of various signal transduction pathways and increased proliferation [18-20]. Given the marked variation in the morphology of different cystic diseases, the genetic aspects and the varying age of presentation, it is quite likely that certain features of the pathophysiology of cyst formation diverge between the individual entities. Therefore, insights into the function of the cilium will only explain common aspects in the pathogenesis of cyst formation and have to be interpreted in the context of the pathophysiology of a specific disease or syndrome. The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence linking the ciliary flow sensor to cyst formation, to discuss ciliary downstream signalling in response to flow and to hypothesize about the physiological functions of the ciliary flow sensor in the kidney and how its disruption may promote cystogenesis. Since vascular phenotypes are not a universal feature of PKD and shear stress in arteries is one order of magnitude higher compared with renal tubules, we will not address the role of cilia in the vasculature.
The cilium as a mechanosensor
Cilia exist on most cells in mammalian organisms [4]. In tubules, cilia are constantly exposed to urine flow, so it is intuitive that they act as flow sensors. Flow sensing is difficult to study in vivo. Alternative approaches have involved cell culture experiments in flow chambers with Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, immortalized cells from transgenic animals, human cyst-derived cells and ex vivo studies with explanted tubules from rodents [17, 21-24]. MDCK cells respond to bending of the cilium by a micropipette or fluid flow with influx of calcium [17, 25]. The initial signal is amplified through nucleotide release and occurs through influx of extracellular calcium via the apical surface which is followed by calcium-induced calcium release from IP3-dependent stores which is transmitted to other cells through gap junctions [26-28]. The cilium is required for calcium transients under flow because ablation of the cilium in MDCK cells by chemical means abolishes the flow response [21, 25]. This view is supported by the finding of blunted flow sensing in isolated renal collecting ducts from cilia-deficient orpk mice [29].
Direct and indirect loss of function experiments link polycystins to cilia by demonstrating a lack of or altered calcium signals in response to fluid flow. Experiments in flow

chambers with isolated cells from transgenic mice that lack functional PC-1, as well as in MDCK cells inducibly depleted of PC-2, a cation channel of the TRP family (TRPP2), by small hairpin RNA, showed that Pkd1 and Pkd2 are needed for flow-induced calcium signalling [23, 30]. In a different approach, immortalized cyst lining cells from patients with a mutation in Pkd1 were compared with immortalized normal kidney cells and showed no flow-induced calcium signals [24]. PC-2 was absent in the cilia of the Pkd1-mutant cells which would explain the loss of flow-induced calcium transients. Similarly, mislocalization of PC-2 at the apical membrane was described in unciliated orpk cells [31] and expression of an N-terminal mutant of PC-2 in MDCK cells that is deficient in ciliary trafficking had a dominant-negative effect on calcium signalling under flow [32, 33]. Bearing in mind the significant heterogeneity in flow chamber set-ups, cell types, amount of shear stress and timing of calcium response in the studies described, these data suggest that PC1 and -2 are intimately involved in flow- and cilia-dependent intracellular calcium increase.
Is the loss of the ciliary flow sensor sufficient to cause cyst formation? Several important studies suggest that this is not the case [34-36]. The genetic model of cyst formation in ADPKD is believed to lie in the loss of heterozygosity for a PKD gene in individual cells that then begin to lose polarity, proliferate and form cysts [37]. However, the inactivation of Pkd1 after completion of the postnatal stage of kidney development in mice ( postnatal day 14) does not lead to accelerated cyst formation [38]. Analogous results were found after late inactivation of the ciliary motor protein Kif3a or IFT88 [35, 36], suggesting that quiescent cells in the adult kidney do not require cilia or PC-1 for maintaining tubular morphology in the intermediate term (the kidneys do form cysts in the long term). The second piece of evidence involves the osmosensor TRPV4, a transient receptor potential cation channel that forms a polymodal channel complex with PC-2 [34]. MDCK cells depleted of TRPV4 by inducible shRNA failed to display calcium transients in response to flow. Yet, TRPV4 morphant zebrafish did not replicate the Pkd2 phenotype of pronephric cysts [34]. Furthermore, mice lacking TRPV4 do not develop cystic kidneys [39]. Apart from the possibility of redundancy, these data argue that disruption of ciliary flow sensing alone does not suffice to transform renal epithelial cells into cyst-forming cells, and that additional factors are required. This concept is supported by the fact that the induction of ischaemia-reperfusion injury in Pkd1 or ciliadeficient mice induces rapid cyst formation [35, 40].
Polarity
A large body of evidence shows that cyst formation involves dysregulation of multiple signal transduction pathways and the disruption of cell polarity [18-20]. The Wnt pathway is a versatile signalling system regulating fate determination, proliferation and planar cell polarity that is strongly intertwined with renal development and the maintenance of kidney morphology [41]. Canonical Wnt signalling is initiated upon binding of a Wnt ligand to a Frizzled receptor causing stabilization and nuclear translocation of -catenin as

well as target gene expression [42]. A number of findings link the canonical Wnt pathway to PKD. The intracellular tail of PC-1 interacts with -catenin involving cleavage of a C-terminal fragment and translocation to the nucleus [43, 44]. The activation as well as the inhibition of canonical Wnt signalling results in cyst formation, and increased Wnt activity has been found in gene profiling studies on cysts from patients with ADPKD [41, 45]. Secreted Frizzled-related protein 4, which specifically inhibits canonical Wnt signalling, is upregulated in human ADPKD yet recapitulates a ciliary phenotype when overexpressed in zebrafish [46], thus suggesting a finely tuned balance of canonical Wnt activity in the nephron. Several lines of evidence link cilia to canonical Wnt signalling [47]: tissue-specific inactivation of Kif3a in renal tubular cells in vivo resulted in increased nuclear -catenin levels [13]. Work in cultured cells demonstrated that ablation of cilia by targeting Kif3a or Ift88 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) resulted in upregulated sensitivity to Wnt3 and increased levels of -catenin [48]. Similarly, downregulation of genes involved in Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS1, BBS2 and MKKS) resulted in a hyperactive Wnt response in cultured cells [49]. Unpublished data from our group show that -catenin-dependent reporter activity is downregulated in MDCK cells under flow. Taken together, these results imply that cilia inhibit canonical Wnt signalling. It must be noted, however, that cilia-deficient mouse embryos failed to show evidence of altered canonical Wnt signalling [50], which suggests that the regulation of -catenin-dependent signalling by cilia involves a level of complexity that is currently not understood.
The data on how cilia affect the non-canonical, or PCP ( planar cell polarity), pathway are clearer. PCP describes the ability of cells to orient along the plane relative to an axis [51]. Distinct readouts of PCP have been described including wing and eye development in Drosophila melanogaster, and in vertebrates inner ear development and convergent extension, a process describing elongation of the embryo through cell intercalation. Strong evidence implicating cilia in PCP comes from mice with missing cilia through tissue specific targeting of Ift88 and Kif3a: these animals displayed a highly disordered tissue architecture in the inner ear [52]. During normal kidney development tubular cells intercalate perpendicular to the tubular axis resulting in narrowing of tubules [53]. This process requires Wnt9b, an activator of non-canonical Wnt signals, and if disrupted leads to cyst formation. PCP is controlled by the non-canonical pathway through the activity of Disheveled (Dvl), a protein that targets the canonical regulator -catenin for degradation and regulates the activity of Frizzled to orchestrate the polarized distribution of different sets of PCP core proteins [51]. Dvl interacts with Inversin (Inv), a ciliary protein and NPHP2 gene product mutated in nephronophthisis Type 2 [9, 54, 55]. Inv binding to Dvl promotes the degradation of -catenin implying a role as a molecular switch between canonical and non-canonical Wnt signalling [54]. Similar functions have been attributed to BBS proteins, NPHP3, and Kif3a [48, 49, 56]. In addition, several BBS proteins (BBS1, BBS4 and BBS6) interact with the PCP pathway in mice [52, 57].

Another polarized event apart from the convergence of tubular cells during embryonic tubule elongation is oriented cell division (OCD) [58]. Studies in Drosophila and zebrafish have shown that OCD is required for PCP. Misoriented cell division results in disrupted wing shape [59] or disturbed convergent extension [60]. While tubular elongation through epithelial intercalation occurs during embryonic development [53], OCD along the axis of growing tubules is seen in postnatal kidneys [58]. OCD is disrupted in mice mutated in Pkd1, Tsc1/2 and Hnf1 and therefore, associated with cystic kidney disease [61, 62]. Cilia seem to play a role in OCD: in Kif3a-mutant mice, 46% of the mitotic angles were oriented within 20° of the collecting duct axis, in contrast to 91% in normal kidneys [35]. Furthermore, Ift20-mutant mice almost completely lacked cilia and developed renal cysts associated with a misoriented cell division axis [63]. However, loss of OCD does not suffice to trigger cyst formation. A careful study with Pkd1 and Pkd2-mutant mice did not show OCD before cystic dilatation and, conversely, in Pkhd1-mutant mice OCD was lost, but no kidney cysts developed [64]. Similarly, in Pkd1 heterozygous mice, abnormal mitotic spindle orientation has been observed at postnatal Day 2, while only occasional microscopic cysts develop [61]. A further study in Ift140-mutant mice showed disordered cilia assembly, resulting in cystic kidneys but no disoriented mitotic spindle axis was observed [65]. A possible explanation for these findings is that the axis of cell division is not the driving force in cystogenesis, but more likely an indicator of dysregulated cellular orientation and polarity.
It is evident that essential cilia proteins as well as ciliaassociated PKD genes are linked to OCD and convergent extension, but is there any evidence that flow sensing by cilia affects polarity? The best argument for this notion does not come from the kidney, but from the embryonic node and from Xenopus epidermis. The node (embryonic notocord, Kupffer's vesicle in zebrafish) is a ciliated structure in the early embryo that determines left-right body asymmetry in a process where rotating 9+0 cilia create a leftward flow [66]. Disruption of this flow through interference with cilia structure or inactivation of Pkd2 leads to randomization of left- right asymmetry, in the latter case through a lack of flowinduced calcium signals in the periphery of the node [67]. Indeed, situs inversus has been described in rare patients with heterozygote PKD2 mutations [68]. Polarization of 9+2 cilia and basal body structures through flow has been observed in Xenopus skin (Figure 1) [69, 70]. The basal body is one of the two microtubule-based cylinders called centrioles with highly conserved 9-fold radial symmetry. The centriole pair displays structural and functional asymmetry [71]. In multi-ciliated cells of Xenopus larva skin and cilia lining the brain ventricles, the sensing of self-generated flow has been shown to adjust the orientation of the basal body and the direction of ciliary beating in a positive feedback manner involving PCP proteins [69, 70, 72]
As yet, the regulation of PCP in renal epithelial cells by cilia and flow has not been demonstrated in vitro. When MDCK cells were analysed under continuous flow for up to a week, the orientation of mitotic spindles was randomized,

(a) In the epidermis of Xenopus embryos, motile 9+2 cilia generate unidirectional flow ( pink arrow) which is necessary for the polarization of the basal bodies (mother centriole--blue) from which the cilia originate [69]. Polarization is visualized by asymmetric localization of the basal foot, a basal body appendage ( purple triangle).

albeit the cells were completely unciliated for the first 4 days and the number of cell divisions decreased towards zero after the majority of cell reached cilia stage [33]. In a second approach, a wound was induced in a confluent monolayer of ciliated cells under flow, but during the repair phase the mitotic spindles of the migrating cells again showed no orientation in the direction of flow, suggesting that OCD in renal epithelial cells cannot be modelled in vitro (OCD has been described in endothelial cells in the absence of cilia [73, 74]). However, polarization did occur at the centrioles [33]. The mother centriole, also called the basal body, where the primary cilium originates, anchors cytoplasmic microtubules at the sub-distal appendages to attach to the plasma membrane and is mainly stationary. In contrast, the daughter centriole, connected through fibres with the mother centriole, moves extensively during G0 and G1 [75]. Centriole movements in ciliated cells under flow increased compared with the absence of flow and showed a strong motility bias along the axis of flow (the sum of all movements was zero indicating that the centrioles moved around a central point and the position of the cells did not change, Figure 1) [33]. Interestingly, in the cells overexpressing a ciliary trafficking mutant of PC-2 that abolished flow-induced calcium currents, centriole movements were randomized. These data suggest that cilia translate the direction of flow into spatial information and to the centrioles in a calcium-dependent manner. Since polarized centriole movements have not been recorded in renal tubules in vivo, the biological significance of this finding is speculative. Nevertheless, they are proof of the principle that in addition to polarization of the centriolar apparatus of motile 9+2 cilia by self-generated flow [70],

polarization can also occur in passively bent primary, 9+0 cilia in renal epithelia cells. In summary, several lines of evidence exist that cilia and PKD proteins are linked to the polarity of tubular epithelial cells and indirect evidence supports the concept that the ciliary flow sensor and downstream calcium signalling are involved in this process.
PC-1 cleavage and Stat6 signalling
PC-1 is a large orphan receptor with 11 membrane spanning domains [76]. A C-terminal portion of 200 amino acids is cleaved and translocates to the nucleus [77]. Immunoreactivity of this fragment in the nuclei is greatly enhanced in kidneys after ureteral obstruction and kidneys lacking cilia as well as in cysts where flow does not occur, suggesting that the cleavage process is regulated by flow sensing. Indeed, indirect evidence supports this model [78]. The C-terminal fragment of PC-1 interacts with the transcription factor Stat6 and its co-activator p100 to enhance Stat6-dependent transcription. Interestingly, Stat6 is found in cilia of MDCK cells when they are cultured under constant flow, but in the absence of flow, Stat6 is localized in the nucleus, but not cilia, while p100 is localized at the ciliary base under both conditions. A model derived from these observations suggests that under flow, PC1 binds to Stat6 and p100 in the cilium [78]. Disruption of flow results in cleavage of the C-terminal PC-1 fragment and translocation of the complex to the nucleus. The C-terminal cleavage of PC-1 seems to be regulated by PC-2, however, in a calcium-independent mode [79], and direct evidence of PC-1 C-terminal cleavage under flow is lacking. Nevertheless, a recent study observed a decrease in cyst formation in PKD animals with genetic inactivation of Stat6 or treatment with a

mTOR signalling
A lot of attention over the past few years has been focused on the connection between PKD and dysregulated mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) signalling [81]. The interest was set off by the fact that the Tsc proteins which are mutated in tuberous sclerosis, a disease associated with polycystic kidneys, function as negative regulators of mTOR signalling [82] and by the discovery that rapamycin, an immunosuppressive drug that very effectively inhibits the mTOR pathway, prevents cyst growth in rodent models of PKD [83]. mTOR is part of two multi-protein complexes mTORC1 and 2. The rapamycin-sensitive complex mTORC1 regulates protein biosynthesis and cell size and is thus important for cell proliferation [84, 85]. mTORC1 activity is elevated in a substantial proportion of renal cysts and indeed PC1 has been found to interact with tuberin, encoded by Tsc2, and was shown to inhibit mTORC1 activity [86, 87].
Is there a connection between mTOR activity and ciliary flow sensing? Boehlke et al. found that MDCK cells grown under continuous flow were smaller compared with cells grown in the absence of flow [30]. In a series of loss-of-function experiments and biochemical analyses, they found that the cell size under flow is regulated by mTORC1 and requires the presence of cilia (Figure 2). The mechanism for this was interesting: mTOR regulation was independent of flowinduced calcium transients or Akt, an important activator of mTORC1 activity through growth factors [85]. Instead, it was associated with activation of Lkb1, a negative mTORC1 regulator mutated in the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome [88], specifically at the basal body. An important question arising from these findings is what could be the biological significance of mTOR regulation by flow? Indeed, a physiological function can be

deduced from several studies analysing the ciliary length. Several groups have shown that loss of TSC function increases the ciliary length in zebrafish, MEFs and mouse kidneys implicating mTOR in some cases [89-91]. The effect of mTOR signalling on the cilia length was analysed in detail in a recent study on zebrafish and Chlamydomonas [92]. Loss of Tsc1 function or overexpression of the mTORC1 downstream effector S6Kinase resulted in longer cilia in the Kupffer's vesicle. On the other hand, treatment of zebrafish or deflagellated recovering Chlamydomonas with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin decreased the cilia length. The alterations in the ciliary length were physiologically relevant, resulting in altered beat frequency and loss of left-right asymmetry in zebrafish embryos. In Chlamydomonas, a bell curve relationship was discovered between the cilia length and flagellar motility, suggesting that an optimal ciliary length exists in vivo [92]. In a mathematical model, ciliary bending results in maximal membrane stress at the base of the cilium, the site where Lkb1 seems to be active and where Tsc1 is located [30, 91, 93]. Furthermore, the ciliary length is predicted to determine the amount of torque at the basal body transition zone and, therefore, affects the sensing of shear forces [13]. Taken together, these findings could suggest a physiological feedback mechanism, where a decrease in shear forces, e.g. through reduced flow, would increase mTORC1 activity leading to lengthened cilia which, in turn, would amplify the flow signal (Figure 3). Additional observations support this concept: a study from Besschetnova et al. showed that flow negatively affects the ciliary length in wild-type cells albeit not in Pkd1 mutant and constitutively PC-2 depleted cells [94]. Another study analysed biopsies of transplanted kidneys, which suffered acute tubular necrosis during transplantation and observed almost a doubling of ciliary length, which normalized after recovery of allograft function [95]. Similarly, a study analysing the length of cilia in Tsc1± or Tsc2± mice found no ciliary elongation in precystic tubules, where cilia are still subjected to flow. However, cilia were markedly longer (>200%) in the epithelia of fullblown cysts [61], where connection to the tubules is lost and no flow occurs. Taken together, flow-dependent mTOR

F I G U R E 4 : Hypothetical model showing how the cell size may affect shear stress and tubular diameter. Increased mTORC1 activity leads to bigger cell size. In the case of a fixed tubular basement membrane diameter, luminal shear stress will increase. Maintaining a normal level of shear stress requires an increase of tubular basement membrane diameter. Since the deficient ciliary flow sensor is responsible for increased mTORC1 activity and cell size dysregulation, this model requires an alternate mode of shear stress sensing.
regulation may serve to fine-tune the cilia length in an environment of alternating flow speeds and levels of shear stress.
In hypothetical terms, flow-dependent mTOR regulation might be an initial step in cyst formation: pathologically reduced or absent flow sensing by cilia increases the cell size and therefore, would reduce the cross-section of the tubular lumen (Figure 4). The narrowing of luminal diameter would be expected to increase tubular wall stress. Conversely, maintenance of a preset level of shear stress in the setting of increased cell size would require an enlargement of the diameter of the tubular basement membrane to keep the luminal diameter steady. This could theoretically be an initial step to dilatation of the tubule. However, this model requires a second shear stress sensor other than the a priori sensing-deficient cilium. In larger cysts, where flow has ceased, the lack of flow sensing might explain mTORC1 activity in cyst lining cells.
Concluding remarks
It has been exciting times since cilia were implicated in the pathogenesis of PKD. The early and simple model that cilia translate fluid flow into calcium signals through PC-1 and -2, and that loss of either protein function converts signallingdeficient epithelial cells into a proliferating and de-differentiated phenotype that grow into cysts is clearly inadequate to match the complexities of ciliary signalling. Nevertheless, there is clear evidence from cell culture and in vivo models that flow is translated by cilia into cellular events which are associated with cyst formation, namely cell polarization, Stat6- and mTOR signalling. Renal cilia in the mammalian kidney are difficult to access. Therefore, cellular in vitro systems and model organisms such as zebrafish and Xenopus

See "Clinical and Immunological Factors Associated with Postpartum Hepatic Flares in Immune-Tolerant Pregnant Women with Hepatitis B Virus Infection Treated with Telbivudine" by Junfeng Lu, et al. on page 887, Vol. 15, No. 6, 2021

Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a serious chronic disease affecting 250 million people in the world. Most common risk of developing CHB is vertical or mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) from mothers who are hepatitis B surface antigen positive. To prevent MTCT, World Health Organization recommends active vaccination in childhood with hepatitis B immune globulin.1 This strategy has showed a significant decline in MTCT and the global incidence of CHB since the 1990s. However, immunoprophylaxis failure was observed approximately 10% in case of maternal hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels (more than 9 log10 copies/mL), although this active vaccination strategy has been applied.1 Therefore, current guidelines recommend antiviral therapy in the third trimester in pregnant women who are high viral load to reduce the risk of MTCT.2 However, several controversies over antiviral treatment have not been resolved, that is, optimal duration, effect of postpartum therapy, and risk of postpartum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) flare after withdrawal.
In the prvious issue of Gut and Liver, Lu et al.3 reported clinical and immunological factors in postpartum hepatic flares in immune-tolerant patients who received peripartum antiviral prophylaxis against MTCT of CHB. In this study, 36.3% had postpartum hepatic flares, defined a 2-fold increase in ALT at 6 weeks after delivery. They suggested risk factors of postpartum hepatic flares are younger age, greater antepartum ALT, and lower postpartum hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) titer. In immunologic study, the lower interferon  (IFN-) level during pregnancy and the higher IFN- level after delivery were reported to be associated with postpartum hepatic flares. Patients with

these characteristics might experience the transition from immune tolerance phase to immune active phase after delivery. Therefore, they suggested younger patients with postpartum hepatic flares accompanied by lower HBeAg level and higher IFN- level after delivery may be suitable for further re-antiviral treatment. The strength of this study would be to try to suggest the predictive factors of postpartum hepatic flares and need for extension of reantiviral therapy in immune-tolerant patients with CHB. It is unknown whether pregnant women with CHB in the postpartum period are at higher risk of immune-mediated flares and progression of liver disease. When immune reconstitution occurs after delivery, hepatic flares with elevated ALT and higher rates of HBeAg loss have been reported, during early postpartum.4 Most flares are selflimited, but some can be severe liver disease. Therefore, it is an important issue to identify the possible candidates of postpartum hepatic flares.
Pregnancy dynamically changes the maternal immune system and occur to prevent fetus rejection. Regulatory T cell (Treg) frequency in pregnant women is decreased during pregnancy.5 This decrease may also occur due to maternal Tregs migrating to the maternal-fetal surface to prevent maternal-fetal rejection, resulting in decreased peripheral blood Treg frequency. These alterations reverse rapidly after delivery. Huang et al.6 found that the characteristics of T cell immunity was distinct between flares and non-flares mothers from pregnancy to postpartum. T cell immunity in mothers with ALT flares was characterized by lower Treg frequency and higher ratio of pro-inflammatory cytokine to anti-inflammatory cytokine in CD4+ or CD8+

T cells. Maternal immune status might play an important role in postpartum ALT flare in HBV-infected mothers. Thus, the HBV-infected mothers with postpartum hepatic flare should be monitored closely.
Previous studies suggested high HBV DNA level at delivery and withdrawal of antiviral treatment as potential risk factors for postpartum flare.7,8 Postpartum flare occurs in 25% to 44.7% and mainly happens for 3 months postpartum.8 HBV DNA is the most important viral marker for predicting HBV MTCT risk, maternal liver disease progression, and need for antiviral therapy in pregnancy. Yi et al.7 reported that HBV DNA at delivery is a predictive factor of postpartum flare. However, other studies including this study showed HBV DNA levels were not linked to flares.9 Further study is needed in the meaningful role of HBV DNA in postpartum ALT flares. Withdrawal of antiviral agent may be another risk factor of hepatic flare. Mothers with elevated ALT during pregnancy showed higher postpartum flare rate compared with those without ALT elevation (25% vs 11.9%).8 Withdrawal of antiviral therapy should be prudential for mothers with elevated ALT during pregnancy and consider extending antiviral treatment.
We should keep in mind that biochemical flares can occur in postpartum in mothers with CHB treated with antiviral therapy and maternal postnatal monitoring for exacerbations of liver disease is necessary. We also need to understand the limitations of this study in special population and as a clinical unmet need to be solved in pregnant patients in the future. First, there is no generally accepted definition of postpartum flare. Authors used a 2-fold increase in ALT to define hepatic flare in this study. Recent studies have used liberal definitions for ALT flares; any ALT >upper normal limit (UNL); or an ALT >2 or 5 times UNL. These differing definitions of ALT flares make comparisons between studies difficult. Although different criteria of postpartum hepatic flare were defined, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) study in HBV mothers with high viral load showed ALT elevations above the normal range (45%) after the discontinuation of TDF.10 It seems to be no difference between telbivudine and TDF in postpartum hepatic flares. Second, follow-up after delivery was short in this study. Guidelines recommend HBV-infected pregnant women should be monitored closely for up to 6 months after delivery for hepatic flare because the timing of postpartum flare is different on each study.2 Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the rate of postpartum flares in further period. Finally, there is still a lack of meaningful immunological data to support altered immune activity in pregnancy and postpartum. Until now, the change of ALT, HBeAg status, and HBV DNA level are only marker

to identify the natural history of CHB in clinical practice. It is difficult to differentiate the transition from immunetolerant to immune clearance phase in patients during postpartum period. Thus, additional studies on novel HBV biomarkers including HBeAg titer and relevant host immunologic markers are needed to evaluate their prognostic and diagnostic potential in management of patients with CHB in pregnancy and postpartum.

RESULTS: No significant difference has been noted. For the intervention group, mean pain score for 3 days after discharge was 5.67 (SD 6.89), while the control group had a mean of 6.73 (SD 3.99) (p = 0.61). As for the number of pills, for the intervention group mean was 8.00 (SD 4.74), while the control group had a mean of 9.33 (SD 7.05) (p = 0.55).
CONCLUSION: There is no significance in pain score and number of narcotic pills when using the muscle relaxer cyclobenzaprine as an adjunct for pain control following alloplastic breast reconstruction.

INTRODUCTION: In response to a growing opioid crisis, there is an increased focus on reducing opioid consumption perioperatively. Pectoral nerve blocks (Pecs blocks) have previously been shown to successfully manage postoperative pain in mastectomy patients, decreasing perioperative opioid consumption and postoperative nausea. Over the past several years, we have begun incorporating Pecs blocks into our routine breast surgeries including reduction mammoplasty. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of Pecs blocks on opioid consumption and antiemetic requirement in reduction mammoplasty patients.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients who underwent reduction mammoplasty between 2014-2016. All Pecs blocks were performed with ropivacaine under ultrasound guidance by the anesthesia team after induction of general anesthesia, but prior to the start of the operation. Demographics, operative details, opioid and antiemetic use, and complications were recorded. Opioid consumption was converted to a standardized oral morphine equivalence (OME)

value for comparison. Outcomes of patients who received Pecs blocks were compared against those who did not.
RESULTS: Seventy patients underwent reduction mammoplasty by four different attending plastic surgeons at our institution. Twenty-nine patients received Pecs blocks in addition to general anesthesia, while 41 patients received only general anesthesia without a Pecs block. These groups were similar with respect to age, BMI, average breast tissue resection, and follow up time. Performing the Pecs block added approximately 10 minutes of anesthesia time to the patients' case. Notably, intraoperative morphine consumption was significantly lower (85.03 vs 105.44, p = 0.01) in the Pecs block group. Additionally, OME for the first twelve hours following surgery remained slightly lower in the pectoral group (47.07 vs 49.72, p = 0.76), however did not reach significance. PACU antiemetic requirement also trended lower in the pectoral block group with 17.24% of block patients receiving antiemetics vs 24.39% of patients who did not receive a block (p = 0.47). This trend continued through the first twelve hours following surgery (34.48% vs 43.59%, p = 0.45). There were no complications related to the administration of the Pecs blocks.
CONCLUSION: Pectoral nerve blocks provide a safe and effective means of perioperative pain control in breast reduction mammoplasty patients. Administration did not substantially increase anesthesia time but did significantly reduce the need for intraoperative opioid analgesia.

PSTM 2017 Abstract Supplement

Saturday, October 7, 2017

INTRODUCTION: Previous research has highlighted the gender-based disparities that are present throughout the field of surgery.1 The aim of this study is to evaluate the breadth and variability of the issues facing women in plastic surgery, worldwide.
METHODS: A systematic scoping review was undertaken from October 2016 to January 2017, with no restrictions on date or language. We followed the five scoping review steps as proposed by Arskey and O'Malley: (1) Identification of the research question; (2) Identification of relevant studies; (3) Study selection; (4) Data charting and (5) Collation and reporting of results.2 A narrative synthesis of the literature according to themed issues was developed, together with a summary of relevant numeric data.
RESULTS: From the 2,247 articles found in the search, a total of 53 articles were included in the final analysis. The majority of articles were published from the US. Eight themes were identified, as follows: 1. Workforce figures; 2. Gender bias and discrimination; 3. Leadership and academia; 4. Mentorship and role models; 5. Pregnancy, parenting and childcare; 6. Relationships, work-life balance and professional satisfaction; 7. Patient/ public preference; and 10. Retirement and financial planning.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: There were several key findings. First, despite improvement in numbers over time, women plastic surgeons continue to be underrepresented in the United States, Canada and Europe, with prevalence ranging from 14%-25.7%.3,4 Academic plastic surgeons are less frequently female than male, and women academic plastic surgeons score less favorably when outcomes of academic success, such as h index and number of peer-reviewed publications are evaluated.5 Finally, there has been a shift away from overt discrimination towards a more ingrained, implicit bias affecting individuals and institutions; most published cases of bias and discrimination are in association with pregnancy.
The first step toward addressing the issues facing women plastic surgeons is recognition and articulation of the issues. Further research may focus on analyzing geographic variation in the issues and developing appropriate interventions.

INTRODUCTION: In the past decade, women have comprised nearly half of U.S. medical school graduates. However, women may remain underrepresented among surgical residents and surgeons due to factors such as the perceived surgical personality, culture, and lifestyle. We conducted the current study to assess recent trends of women trainees and physicians pursuing careers in plastic and reconstructive surgery to determine differences between this field and other surgical specialties.
METHODS: We reviewed data published by the American Medical Association and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education from 2000 to 2013. We abstracted the number of surgeons and surgical residents by sex, race/ ethnicity, and specialty. We compared the ratio of female-to-male surgeons and residents as well as the racial and ethnic composition of female surgeons between specialties to evaluate for potential differences

ABSTRACT Background: Provider ability to estimate caregiver health literacy (HL) in English-speaking caregivers has been shown to be poor, but estimation of HL in Spanish-speaking caregivers by physicians and staff has yet to be studied. Linguistic differences can further hinder communication in medical care. Objective: This study evaluated how well pediatric providers and staff predict caregiver HL as measured by two HL tools in a bilingual (English/Spanish) population. Method: For this study, we obtained a convenience sample of caregivers, evaluating one group with the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) and the second group with the Short Assessment of Health Literacy (SAHL). Physicians/nurse practitioners (NPs), and medical assistants (MAs) estimated caregiver scores for each tool. We dichotomized estimated and actual scores for each tool using published standards. We used McNemar's test and Cohen's Kappa to evaluate agreement between dichotomized predicted and actual scores. We used log binomial regression to examine how caregiver's language affected agreement between dichotomized caregiver scores and provider estimates. All physicians/NPs were native English speakers only and all MAs were native bilingual English/Spanish speakers. Physicians/NPs used interpretation services when appropriate. Key Results: Fifty caregivers were evaluated using the NVS and 50 using the SAHL. There was no overall association between dichotomized physician/NP or MA estimation and caregiver score for either tool. However, providers' estimates were less likely to match caregiver scores when the caregiver's language was Spanish (NVS: relative risk [RR] = 0.57 [95% CI 0.37, 0.87], SAHL: RR = 0.37 [95% CI 0.23,0.6]). Conclusion: Physician/NP and MA ability to estimate caregiver HL in English proficient and limited English proficiency caregivers is poor. The physician/NP group was less likely to estimate HL correctly if the caregivers spoke Spanish. Providers must use additional caution when providing cross-language care. [HLRP: Health Literacy Research and Practice. 2018;2(2):e107-e114.]
Plain Language Summary: This study examined estimation of health literacy of English- and Spanishspeaking caregivers by pediatric providers and medical assistants. We found that both providers and staff estimate caregiver health literacy poorly, and that primary language discordance may be a factor. The results support the institution of universal health literacy precautions for all caregivers of pediatric patients.

In the United States, Andrulis and Brach (2007) calculated that approximately 40% of adults have limited health literacy, and that over one-half of them are nonwhite and/ or Hispanic. Brice et al. (2008) found low health literacy levels in Spanish-speaking patients in an emergency department, and Alba, Britigan, Lyden, and Johansson (2016)

demonstrated similar results in Spanish-speaking patients in federally qualified health centers across the Midwestern U.S. Functional health literacy has been described as "the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions"

(Kindig, Panzer, & Nielsen-Bohlman, 2004). This definition is undergoing continual revision as research in the field advances and as researchers move away from a "deficit model" toward a realization that health literacy is a social construct that is variable and interdependent on social, economic, demographic, and other unknown factors (Pleasant, 2014). Acknowledging this ambiguity in measurement, definition, and etiology, the fact remains that based on current measures, low health literacy presents challenges in quality care delivery, which can be further exacerbated by language.
Low health literacy affects communication with the health care team and patient/family understanding of their medical instructions and illness. Studies have linked low patient health literacy with poor health outcomes across a variety of disease processes and populations (Berkman, Sheridan, Donahue, Halpern, & Crotty, 2011). Unsurprisingly, parental health literacy has also been linked to health outcomes in the pediatric population (Brega et al., 2016; DeWalt, Dilling, Rosenthal, & Pignone, 2007; Miller, Lee, DeWalt, & Vann, 2010). Additionally, caregivers with low health literacy levels have been reported to perceive more difficulties in accessing care for their children and perceive a lower level of shared decision-making (Yin, Dreyer, et al., 2012). Ongoing research continues to evaluate caregiver health literacy for multiple diseases (Cooper, Chisolm, & McLeod, 2017; Dingemans et al., 2017).
Health literacy is a multifaceted concept that is difficult to define and measure, comprised of different domains and skills such as print literacy, oral literacy, and numeracy (Berkman, Sheridan, Donahue, Halpern, Viera, et al., 2011; Ad Hoc Committee on Health Literacy for the Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Associa-

tion, 1999). There can be a significant discordance in an individual patient or caregiver's aptitude across domains. For example, an in-depth examination found that among Spanish-speaking parents in four centers, scores on the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (a test focusing on language) were adequate, but mathematical skills measured by the Arithmetic Wide Range Achievement Test and functional skills measured by the Parental Health Literacy Activities Test were suboptimal, especially in medication dosing (Yin, Sanders, et al., 2012). A discordance in abilities could complicate the health care team's estimate of a patient's ability to follow instructions or understand disease processes.
Multiple studies have found that physicians overestimate their patients' literacy levels (Bass, Wilson, Griffith, & Barnett, 2002; Lindau et al., 2002). Kelly and Haidet (2007) showed that physicians consistently overestimate adult patients' health literacy skills. Dickens, Lambert, Cromwell, and Piano (2013) showed a similar finding in nurses, and Bass et al. (2002) showed that resident physicians' ability to estimate literacy skills was poor. Potential discordance between a provider's estimation of caregiver health literacy and that caregiver's measured health literacy has also been demonstrated in caregivers of the pediatric population. A 2013 study revealed that provider estimates of English-speaking caregivers' health literacy correlated poorly with the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults and the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine scores, and a 2012 survey indicated that physician assessment of which reading materials were appropriate for caregivers did not match general population literacy levels (Chesser et al., 2012; Harrington, Haven, Bailey, & Gerald, 2013). Critically, these studies did not examine

staff estimation of caregiver health literacy or health literacy estimation of Spanish-speaking caregivers.
Medical assistants (MAs) are an essential part of the medical team at most pediatric practices. They keep patients moving through the clinic and ensure that providers have the information and tools they need. As one of the first points of contact for patients and their families, they often have a deep understanding of patients' personal, social, and medical histories. In many practices, MAs are taking on a larger role with counseling families, discussing medication and chronic disease management, or serving as health coaches (Chapman & Blash, 2017; Djuric et al., 2017; Ferrer, Mody-Bailey, Jaen, Gott, & Araujo, 2009). Additionally, in a clinic with multiple physicians, MAs may serve as a key source of continuity for patients and families. MA estimation of caregiver's health literacy in their role as part of the health care team has not been studied.
The need for health care professionals to accurately estimate such a complex and multifaceted construct such as parental health literacy can be mitigated somewhat by the institution of universal health literacy precautions. However, the health care team must still assess caregiver ability to follow instructions and understand disease so that we can identify ways in which we can improve in our role in the health literacy system by minimizing our own participation in barriers to care and health disparities. In this study, we sought to determine how well members of the health care team, providers (physicians/nurse practitioners [NPs]), and MAs in our pediatric clinic estimated the health literacy levels of Spanish-speaking and English-speaking pediatric caregivers as measured by two tools determining different domains of health literacy--print literacy and numeracy.
METHODS Sample/Data Collection
This endeavor was part of a larger study examining the relationship between health literacy tools and obesity and immunization completion. The original research plan was to perform the study using only the Newest Vital Sign (NVS), which focuses on comprehension and numeracy (Weiss et al., 2005). As the study progressed, the investigators decided to add an additional group using the Short Assessment of Health Literacy--Spanish and English (SAHL S&E). This tool measures different skills in the caregivers by focusing on reading ability (Lee, Stucky, Lee, Rozier, & Bender, 2010).
The enrollment goal was 100 caregivers, 50 for each of the two health literacy tools. No formal sample size calculation was performed. Enrollment and assessment for the group weighed with the NVS was performed in the spring and

summer of 2016. Enrollment and assessment of the group measured with the SAHL S&E was subsequently performed in the summer and fall of 2016. We obtained convenience samples of caregivers who accompanied pediatric patients to a satellite clinic of an academic medical center in the Midwest. The satellite clinic serves a majority Spanish-speaking patient population who are low income. During the time that caregivers were waiting with their pediatric patient for a scheduled appointment, bilingual research assistants offered them the opportunity to enroll in the study. They obtained verbal consent per the Institutional Review Board approved protocol (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, IRB #5902).
Research assistants reviewed the patient's chart and extracted the number of recent clinic visits and number of recent clinic visits with the specific provider (physician/NP) whom they were seeing that day. Research assistants administered either the NVS or the SAHL S&E, then asked both the treating MA and the physician/NP to estimate the score on the health literacy tool that the caregiver had taken. MAs and physicians/NPs also gave informed consent to participate in the study. Investigators showed them the tools ahead of time and instructed them on each tool's administration and scoring. MAs and physicians/NPs were blinded with respect to caregiver scores on the tools. All MAs were native Spanish speakers and bilingual in English and Spanish. Physicians/ NPs either used an interpreter or spoke Spanish, but none were native Spanish speakers. Spanish language proficiency was determined either by a passing score on the ALTA Spanish examination or by direct evaluation by bilingual clinic staff (ALTA Language Services, 2003).
Outcome Measures Primary outcome measures were caregiver scores and
provider and MA estimations on each tool. We dichotomized scores and estimations to adequate/less than adequate denoting adequate health literacy using published standards (adequate >3 for the NVS and adequate >14 for the SAHL S&E) (Lee et al., 2010; Weiss et al., 2005).
We recognized that the tool published on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (2016) website contained spelling and translation errors ("harmonía" should be "armonía" and "abnormal" should be "anormal"). We corrected these errors and evaluated the caregivers using the corrected tool.
Covariates Covariates examined for the study included language
used by the caregiver, use of an interpreter by the provider,

and provider familiarity with the patient/caregiver (both by provider self-report and number of recent visits). We did not collect any further specific demographic information on caregivers in our population as investigators felt this may have negatively affected participation due to fears of potential legal ramifications in relation to immigration status (Sheehan et al., 2016).
Statistical Analysis All data analysis was performed with SAS 9.4 software.
Fisher's exact test was used to compare the proportions of caregivers assessed with each tool whose scores exceeded published cutoffs. For the analysis of estimation accuracy, we stratified the data by estimator type (physician/NP or MA) and by tool (NVS or SAHL S&E) for analysis. We used McNemar's test and Cohen's Kappa to evaluate for agreement between the caregivers' actual dichotomized scores and the providers' dichotomized estimations. Using separate log binomial regression models, we assessed how the probability of an accurate estimation by the provider was affected by the language of the caregiver, whether or not the provider used an interpreter or whether or not the provider was familiar with the family.
RESULTS We asked 88 caregivers to take the NVS tool. Thirty-seven
declined and one was excluded due to being outside of the age range for enrollment. Thus, we analyzed responses on the NVS for a total of 50 caregivers (57% participation). We asked 77 caregivers to take the SAHL S&E, of which 27 declined. Thus, we analyzed responses on the SAHL S&E for a

total of 50 caregivers (65% participation). See Table 1 for details regarding the language of participants and results of the NVS and SAHL S&E by language group. We did not collect specific demographic information on the caregivers, but the population in the clinic is approximately 80% Spanish speaking, with approximately 75% of those indicating Mexico as their country of origin.
The percentage of caregivers with relatively high health literacy scores differed significantly between the two tools. Only 20% [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.5, 31.5] of the caregivers who took the NVS measured as having adequate health literacy (score >3), but 84% [95% CI 73.5, 94.5] who took the SAHL S&E measured as having adequate health literacy (score >14), (p = .0001). In our sample, English speakers performed better than Spanish speakers on the NVS (p = .0007), and the performance of the two language groups on the SAHL S&E was roughly equal (p = .3785).
Primary Outcome: Literacy Estimation Participating providers included nine attending pediatri-
cians, two pediatric residents, one NP, and five MAs. None of the physicians/NP were native Spanish speakers, but all of the MAs were bilingual in English and Spanish from childhood.
Both physicians/NP and MAs underestimated scores of the SAHL S&E and overestimated scores of the NVS. Cohen's Kappa scores for physician/NP and MA estimation for both tools was < 0.2. Physicians/NP correctly estimated a caregiver's dichotomized score for the NVS 56% of the time [95% CI 41.7, 70.2] and MAs gave an accurate estimation 46% of the time [95% CI 31.7, 60.3]. Physicians/NP correctly estimated a caregiver's dichotomized score for the SAHL S&E 48% of the time [95% CI 33.7, 62.3] and MAs also accurately predicted dichotomized score 48% of the time [95% CI 33.7, 62.3]. To show the magnitude and direction of misestimation on each tool, patient scores and physician/NP estimated scores are plotted for both tools in Figure 1. Points in the lower left and upper right quadrants represent agreement of dichotomized (adequate/less than adequate) scores. Plots of patient scores and MA estimates were similar (not included).
Language of the patient made a substantial difference in accuracy of score predictions by physicians/NP (Table 2), but not in predictions by MAs. Log binomial regression revealed that physicians/NP were more likely to incorrectly estimate dichotomized score on either tool if the caregiver was speaking Spanish rather than English. This effect was statistically significant for both tools when an interpreter was not used, as well as for the SAHL S&E when an interpreter was used. The negative association was present but did not reach statistical significance when an interpreter was used in the NVS

group. Estimation success of physicians/NP using an interpreter for Spanish-speaking caregivers did not significantly differ from those that communicated in Spanish without an interpreter (relative risk [RR] with an interpreter versus without an interpreter: NVS RR = 1.74 [95% CI 0.87, 3.52], SAHL RR = 0.68 [95% CI 0.26, 1.82]). Log binomial regression revealed a slight estimation advantage on the SAHL for MAs when they reported knowing the patient somewhat well or very well versus not well (RR = 1.71 [95% CI 1, 2.9]). No other association between accuracy of estimation and either provider familiarity with the family, the number of visits to the clinic, or the number of visits with the specific provider was detected.
DISCUSSION The primary aim of this study was to determine the
accuracy of physician/NP and MA estimations of caregiver health literacy with the goal of improving effective health care team participation in health literacy cocreation. Our results showed that overall, physicians/NP and MAs performed poorly in their estimations of caregiver performance, irrespective of tool used. This suboptimal performance of the estimators is consistent with other published studies examining physician estimation of adult health literacy in patients and caregivers (Bass et al., 2002;

Harrington et al., 2013; Kelly & Haidet, 2007). However, our data confirm a similar pattern with MAs, and more importantly, demonstrate that primary language discordance may play a significant role, even when adequate language skills or interpretation are used. These potentially inaccurate estimates can lead the health care team to give instructions to caregivers that are difficult to understand and follow.
Physicians/NP were significantly worse at estimating the health literacy scores of Spanish speakers than that of English speakers. This is consistent with findings showing that patients who have limited English proficiency have more communication barriers in a medical encounter (Wilson, Chen, Grumbach, Wang, & Fernandez, 2005). This discrepancy in estimation was present in both tools, each measuring different domains of the construct. Furthermore, the performance of the caregivers on the two tools differed significantly, and the performance of each language group on each tool was also different (English speakers performed much better than Spanish speakers on the NVS, but this was not the case on the SAHL S&E). Additionally, the effect was present despite the universal use of adequate interpretation services or documented language concordant physicians (although none of the physicians/NP were native Spanish speakers). The maintenance of the consistent pattern in difference in estimation

accuracy by language despite varying tools and caregiver performance seems to indicate that discordant primary language between the provider and caregiver is the primary reason for the difference. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that the estimation difference by language was not present for the MAs, who were all primary Spanish/English bilingual. Although their estimations were uniformly poor, no difference existed between the language groups.
The poor estimation skills of the MAs are a finding that has not been previously reported in the literature. This is especially important in pediatrics, where MAs often are in the position to provide a significant portion of face-toface counselling, continuity of care, and anticipatory guidance depending on office setup.
Prevalence of adequate caregiver health literacy scores differed significantly between the two measurement tools. This finding is consistent with previously published work by Singh, Coyne, and Wallace (2015) and likely reflects that the NVS and SAHL S&E measure different domains of health literacy, with the NVS more focused on numeracy.
STUDY LIMITATIONS Measurement ambiguity was the source of the most sig-
nificant limitation of our study, as using the health literacy tool as a proxy for a complex multidomain concept leaves room for misinterpretation and overgeneralization. Also, future studies would benefit from simultaneous measurement of the same caregiver with multiple health literacy assessment tools as well as evaluation of understanding and completion of targeted tasks essential to the care of the child to cross check the proxy measures. Estimation of task completion would be a better measure of the health care team and caregiver's face-to-face interaction creating a shared understanding of the relevant information. Although our caregivers were all from the same population, we administered the tools on separate groups. In light of these multiple limitations, the consistency of our finding that estimation efficacy is strongly associated with primary language concordance between provider and caregiver was even more notable. Despite the measurement ambiguity inherent to health literacy and the separate testing groups, the finding of a negative association between discordant primary language and estimation ability was preserved.
CONCLUSIONS The inaccuracy of health care team estimation of care-
giver health literacy demonstrated in our study strongly supports the institution of universal health literacy pre-

cautions for caregivers of pediatric patients based on population estimates of health literacy. Efforts such as Healthy People 2020 should be supported, and their implementation studied further (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2016). Processes such as universal teaching and Teach-Back seem both reasonable and essential for responsible clinical care. Critically, the health care team should be especially cautious when their native language differs from that of the caregiver, even when they have proficiency in the caregiver's language or adequate interpretation services.

Introduction: Fifteen to twenty percent of the patients with complete hydatidiform mole transform malignancy into gestational trophoblastic tumors. The marked proliferation of trophoblastic cells is one of the characteristics that determines high risk for the occurrence of post-hydatidiform mole malignancy. The objective of the study was to analyze the histopathologic feature of the marked proliferation of trophoblastic cells as a role in posthydatidiform mole malignancy that can be used as a determinant of the risk of malignancy post-hydatidiform mole. Methods: The method of the study was analytical observational with a case-control study design. The data were taken retrospectively from medical records of patients with a post-complete hydatidiform mole malignancy and patients who do not develop postcomplete hydatidiform mole malignancy (n = 34). The study took place in the Department of Anatomical Pathology Laboratorium at Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia. Results: The results showed a highly significant difference with the histopathologic char­ acteristics of marked trophoblastic cell proliferation in post-complete hydatidiform mole malignancy, reaching up to 73.5%. In contrast, the difference between those who do not develop malignancy was 11.8%. The odds ratio (OR) was 20.83, with an interpretation that patients with a complete hydatidiform mole with the histopathological feature of marked trophoblastic cell proliferation had a risk of developing into malignancy 20.83 times higher compared to cases without marked trophoblastic cell proliferation. Conclusion: The conclusion of the study was there is a significant correlation between marked trophoblastic cell proliferation with the incidence of post-complete hydatidiform mole malignancy. Keywords: post-complete hydatidiform mole malignancy, histopathologic trophoblastic cells, cells proliferation

Introduction
Trophoblast disease is still commonly found in various parts of the world, and high incidence rates are found in developing countries, including Indonesia. The inci­ dence of hydatidiform mole in Western countries occurs within the ranges of 1:1000 to 1:2500 pregnancies, while choriocarcinoma cases occur between 1:14,000 and 1:40,000 pregnancies.1

The incidence of hydatidiform molar pregnancy in Japan (2/1000 pregnancies) is three times greater than the incidence reported in Europe or North America (0.6-1.1/1000 pregnancies). In Taiwan, 1/125 pregnancies are molar pregnancies, while in the United States, the incidence occurs in 1/1500 live births. Setyorini reported that within 181 patients with gestational tumors who were treated in 20 hospitals in Bandung in the period from January 1 to December 31, 1998, 122 were patients with cases of hydatidiform mole, and 59 were patients with cases of malignant trophoblastic tumors among 19,242 deliveries. The average incidence of hydatidiform mole in all hospitals in Bandung is 1:427 deliveries and the incidence of malignant trophoblastic tumors is 1:882 deliveries.2
Most hydatidiform mole patients will be cured after treatment. Still, approximately 15-20% will undergo a malignant transformation into gestational trophoblastic tumor (GTT).1,3,4 The risk factors that are thought to play a role in the occurrence of malignancy after hyda­ tidiform mole are not known yet. Several epidemiologi­ cal studies report that the risk of choriocarcinoma increases with age.5,6 Martaadisoebrata says that the occurrence of choriocarcinoma after hydatidiform mole at the age of 35 years is higher, which is approximately 23.1% compared to <35 years, which is around 17.9%.7 Similarly, Jayamasa et al found that patients aged >35 years old with hydatidiform mole have a risk of experi­ encing malignancy 2.1-3.8 times greater than patients aged <35 years.8 In addition to age, several other risk factors for malignancy were parity, uterine size, presence of lutein cysts, suspicious histopathological features, and high hCG levels above 100,000 mIU/mL.1,2,5-8
Currently, the management of hydatidiform mole patients includes improving general conditions, evacuation of molar tissue, prevention of malignancy, and early detec­ tion of malignancy after mole evacuation.9,10 Gestational trophoblastic tumors are mostly preceded by hydatidiform mole, where 15% are preceded by complete hydatidiform mole and 1% by partial hydatidiform mole.11,12 There is a high-risk group for post-hydatidiform mole malignancies such as people aged 35 years, uterine size greater than 20 weeks, hCG levels above 100,000 mIU/mL, presence of lutein cysts, history of second pregnancy with mole, postevacuation bleeding, presence of lungs involvement, and complications of preeclampsia, histopathological features of excessive trophoblastic hyperplasia.11,12

Hydatidiform mole has been known as a benign tro­ phoblastic disorder caused by the process of trophoblast cell proliferation, while choriocarcinoma is a malignant form with a depiction of metastasis. However, there is still little science that discusses the role of genes at the molecular level and regulates the process of proliferation or trophoblast differentiation in this disease.11
Trophoblast cell activity that does not disappear spon­ taneously after an evacuation can develop into gestational trophoblastic tumor. Although complete hydatidiform mole has a higher rate of occurrence to become a gestational trophoblastic tumor, this representation can­ not be used as the same prediction for everyone, and it is not known yet what factors regulate such change.12,13
Based on this background, the central theme in this study is that 15-30% hydatidiform mole can develop into gestational trophoblastic tumors (GTT). The pathogenesis of post-hydatidiform malignancy is not known yet.12,13 The pathogenesis of post-hydatidiform malignancy is also influenced by clinical risk factors, including age 35 years, uterine size 20 weeks, the presence of unilateral/ bilateral lutein cysts, hCG levels 100,000 mIU/mL, and suspicious histopathological features have been used as variables of clinical risk factors related to the incidence of post-hydatidiform malignancies. The proliferation of trophoblast cells is influenced by several factors, including angiogenesis and cell apoptosis. hCG levels are the pre­ dictor for the occurrence of hydatidiform mole malignancy that has been used to date. In this study, the researchers thought that this study should link hCG levels with excessive proliferation of trophoblast cells. However, it is important to note that not all trophoblast cell types pro­ duce hCG, and the cells that can produce hCG are syncytiotrophoblastic cells, and it is difficult to study anatomical pathology. Therefore other help might be required to enforce it. In the case of post-hydatidiform malignancies almost all showed an increase in hCG levels, but in cases where there was an increase in hCG levels, not all showed trophoblast cell features with excess proliferation in the histopathological picture. Therefore in this study, the researchers analyzed the histopathological picture of the proliferation of trophoblast cells in complete hydatidiform mole as a risk factor for the occurrence of malignancy after a complete hydatidiform mole.

tumors (GTT) from 2007 to 2011 who had been treated at the Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital. The inclusion criteria were complete hydatidiform mole patients who had undergone dilation and curettage at Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital and who had histopathological results.
This study was an observational analytic study with a case-control study design. Data were taken retrospectively from the medical record of complete hydatidiform mole patients who experienced malignancy and who did not experience malignancy. The sample size is determined by consecutive sampling until the minimum sample size is met.
All results of the curettage of the patient with complete hydatidiform mole were made into block paraffin prepara­ tions. Then, these paraffin blocks are examined in the trophoblast cells to determine whether the cells undergo excessive proliferation or not.
After that, trophoblast cells that either proliferate excessively or not are compared with the incidence of malignancy post-complete hydatidiform mole.
Operational definition of complete hydatidiform postmole malignancy/gestational trophoblastic tumor is a malignant form of trophoblast. Gestational trophoblastic tumor can include invasive mole, choriocarcinoma, pla­ cental site trophoblastic tumors, or epithelioid trophoblas­ tic tumors determined by an anatomical pathologist.
Complete hydatidiform mole tissue taken from paraffin preparation blocks was examined histopathologically on trophoblast cells. The tissue is determined whether it runs into excessive proliferation or not. Proliferative groups of trophoblast cells outside the chorionic villi with four or more layers of thickness and mitosis of cells found in number more than 4 in 10 visual fields are classified as excessive proliferation. While categorized as a no excessive prolifera­ tion groups if no trophoblast cells were found outside the corialis villi with four or more layers of thickness and no mitotic cells were found in more than 4 per 10 visual fields.

mole patients was performed in 34 cases of hydatidiform mole malignancy (GTT) and 34 cases that did not become malignant (hydatidiform mole) (Figure 1A and B).
Characteristics and histopathological analyses of the subjects were registered in the Department of Anatomical Pathology at Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia. The complete research results are presented in Table 1.
The characteristics of the study subjects based on age showed that the average age of patients who undergo malig­ nancy (gestational trophoblastic tumor) was 32.1 years and the average age of those who did not undergo malignancy (hyda­ tidiform mole) was 28.6 years. The number of patients under the age of 20 who underwent malignancy was 3; between the ages of 20 and 40, 22; and over the age of 40, 9. The number of

patients who did not have a malignancy (hydatidiform mole) under 20 years of age was seven people; between the ages of 20 and 40, 22; and over the age of 40, 9 people.
The characteristics of the study subjects based on parity showed that there were 17 patients with malignancy (gesta­ tional trophoblastic tumor) below 1 parity, 8 patients with 2-3 parity, and 4 patients with 4 parity. The characteristics of the study subjects based on parity showed that 22 patients did not undergo malignancy (hydatidiform mole) below one parity, 7 patients with 2-3 parity, and 5 patients with 4 parity. The characteristics of age and parity in the two study groups were not statistically significant (p>0.05).
Table 2 presents the correlation between the histo­ pathologic features of trophoblast cells with posthydatidiform mole malignancy with very significant results. In the case of malignancy after complete hydatidi­ form mole (GTT), the percentage of histopathological characteristics of the over-proliferation of trophoblast cells is 73.5%. In contrast, the percentage of the nonmalignancy group is 11.8. The risk (Odds Ratio) is calcu­ lated, and the result is OR = 20.83. This means that patients with complete hydatidiform mole with histopatho­ logical characteristics of excessive trophoblast cell prolif­ eration are at risk of developing gestational trophoblastic tumor after complete hydatidiform mole 20.83 times more compared with cases that have histopathological features of non-excessive trophoblast cells proliferation.

excessive trophoblast cells proliferation that plays a role in the incidence of malignancy following complete hydatidi­ form mole of the period 2007-2011.
Compared to the total population of Indonesia in 2006, of 222,192,000 people, the number of women aged 15-64 years in reproductive age was 65,414,370 (49,86%), while the number of women who died of cancer was 4.3% of all causes of death due to the disease.14 The incidence ratio of hydatidiform mole is 1:150 childbirth in Southeast Asia.15,16 At Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia, the ratio is quite high (1 in 77 preg­ nancies) especially for young women and old women, and approximately 15-20% experience malignancy in becom­ ing gestational trophoblastic tumor, while the factors that cause changes in hydatidiform mole to gestational tropho­ blastic tumor are still under study.1,3,4
The Bracken MB study proclaimed that maternal age affects molar pregnancies. Women over 40 years of age have 5-10 times greater risks of suffering from complete hydatidiform mole.17 This is confirmed by the studies conducted by Acaia B, Parazzini F, and Vecchia which conclude that eggs in older women are more susceptible to abnormal fertilization that can result in complete hydatidi­ form moles.18 On the other hand, the studies of Graham IH, Fajardo AM, and Richard RL stated that they occur mostly at the age above 20-24 years. This is consistent with the largest population of pregnancies at reproductive age (20-35 years).19
The analysis results of our study in Table 1 for parity in the group of patients who undergo malignancy (GTT) show that 17 patients have 0-1 parity, 8 have 2-3 parity, and 8 have more than 4 parity. The result of parity in groups without malignancy shows that as many as 22

patients have 0-1 parity, 7 have 2-3 parity, and 5 have more than 4 parity. For parity mostly below 1; for gesta­ tional trophoblastic disease case 50% and hydatidiform mole 65%. This is not consistent with previous studies which stated that the incidence increased simultaneously with parity. The characteristics of age and parity in the two study groups were not statistically significant (p>0.05)
Gestational trophoblastic disease is a group of diseases originating from fetal khorion characterized by abnormal trophoblastic tissue proliferation.20 Martaadisoebrata found that 36.6% of mola patients who had become chor­ iocarcinomas had an excessive proliferation of trophoblas­ tic cells compared to 10% of those without malignancy.7 While Mukawi TJ, based on the results of studies on hydatidiform moles, suggests that complete hydatidiform moles with excessive hyperplasia tend to turn malignant in the subsequent course of the disease.21
Malignancy is characterized by the loss of growth control. The marker for cancer is the uncontrolled prolif­ eration of cells in the cellular cycle and tumor cells undergo typical abnormalities in the genes that directly regulate these cell cycles.22 Normally, there are three classes of regulatory genes (regulatory genes), namely: growth-enhancing genes (proto-oncogenes), growthinhibiting cancer suppressor genes (antioncogenes) and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Several genes that regulate cell function in the pathophysiology of hydatidi­ form mole are not clearly known yet.22
Oncoproteins can trigger cell growth and stimulate tumor suppressor genes that will function to block cell proliferation. Damage to this suppressor gene means the ability to restrain cell growth is disrupted. The increase in the number of cells is likely due to increased proliferation and increased cells caused by decreased apoptosis or decreased differentiation processes.23
Table 2 presents the relationship between histopatho­ logical features of trophoblast cells with malignancy post-hydatidiform mole which show very significant results, where the percentage in the case of malignancy post-complete hydatidiform mole with histopathological features of excessive trophoblastic cell proliferation is 73.5%; while in cases that did not experience a malignancy is 11.8%. The risk (odds ratio) is calcu­ lated, and the result is OR = 20.83. This means that patients with complete hydatidiform mole with histo­ pathological characteristics of excessive trophoblast cell proliferation are at risk of developing gestational tropho­ blastic tumor after complete hydatidiform mole 20.83

times more compared with cases that have histopatholo­ gical features of non-excessive trophoblast cells prolif­ eration. This is in accordance with previous studies acknowledging that the excessive proliferation of tropho­ blast cell proliferation in complete hydatidiform mole is more likely to turn malignant in the subsequent course of the disease.
Conclusions
There is a significant relationship between histopathologi­ cal features of excessive trophoblast proliferation and the occurrence of malignancy after a complete hydatidiform mole. The histopathological feature of the overproliferation of trophoblast cells is a risk factor for the occurrence of malignancy after a complete hydatidiform mole.

Abstract. MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are posttranscriptional regulators that serve important roles in osteoclastogenesis and bone metabolism; however, the roles of miRNAs have not been completely clarified. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of miR1005p on the mechanism of liverbone endocrine metabolism. A miRNA microarray analysis was conducted to evaluate the miRNA expression profile during receptor activator of nuclear factorB ligandstimulated osteoclastogenesis. Hematoxylin and eosin and tartrateresistant acid phosphatase staining were performed to analyze the trabecular bone microstructure and osteoclast differentiation. The mRNA and protein expression levels were assessed by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. The results revealed that in vitro osteoclast differentiation and in vivo bone resorption were suppressed by miR1005p overexpression. In vivo, a decrease in miR1005p and an increase in FGF21 were simultaneously observed in mice following ovariectomy (OVX). Bioinformatics analysis and experimental data confirmed that FGF21 was a direct target of miR1005p. Conversely, augmentation of miR1005p using a specific agomir in OVXoperated mice decreased the levels of FGF21 in the serum and liver, and prevented osteoclastogenesis and bone loss. The present study revealed that FGF21 may be a signal molecule associated with the mechanism of liverbone endocrine metabolism and may be targeted by miR1005p. In addition, miR1005p may serve an important role in protecting against OVXinduced osteoporosis.

Introduction
As a dynamic metabolic system, bone modeling or remodeling is modulated by two major bone cells: Osteoblasts, which are able to secrete bone matrix and accelerate calcium (Ca) deposition, and osteoclasts, which are responsible for resolving mineralized bone matrix (13). In the process of bone maintenance and repair, extracellular signaling transduction between osteoblasts and osteoclasts serves a crucial role in bone homeostasis (4). For example, osteoblastsecreted receptor activator of nuclear factorB (NFB) (RANK) ligand (RANKL) binds to the RANK receptor on osteoclasts, thus promoting osteoclast survival and osteoclastogenesis (5). In addition, the binding of macrophage colonystimulating factor (MCSF) to its receptor, colony stimulating factor receptor, has been reported to be essential for the generation of osteoclast precursor cells that are present prior to RANKL stimulation (2). Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor receptorassociated factor6activated NFB signaling induces the initialization of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), which is a key transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis and stimulates the expression of various osteoclastspecific genes, including tartrateresistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K (Ctsk) and calcitonin receptor (2,5).
MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are a class of small, singlestranded, noncoding RNA molecules, 1824 nucleotides in length, which can regulate gene expression or translation by targeting 3'untranslated regions (3'UTRs). miRNAs serve as a novel class of posttranscriptional regulators that are involved in diverse biological functions (68). Previous studies have reported that miRNAs serve important roles in regulating skeletal development (9,10). For example, overexpression of miR34a, miR125a and miR503 inhibits osteoclastogenesis to rescue bone loss (9,11,12). Conversely, miR214 promotes osteoclastogenesis, and inhibits osteoblast differentiation and bone formation (10,13). miR100 is a member of the miR99 family (14) and participates in various biological processes, including chemotherapy resistance, apoptosis, osteogenic differentiation and osteoporotic fractures (1518). However, the role of miR100 in ovariectomy (OVX)induced osteoporosis and osteoclastogenesis remains unclear.
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 is a member of the FGF family, which is mainly expressed in the liver, and has numerous metabolic functions (19). FGF21 has been demonstrated to

improve obesityassociated glucose and lipid metabolic disorders (20), renal dysfunction (21), cardiac hypertrophy (22) and ethanolassociated liver injury (23). Conversely, upregulation of FGF21 is an independent risk factor associated with the severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (24). In a dietinduced mouse model of obesity, a reduction in plasma FGF21 levels and hepatic FGF21 resistance by exenatide protects against highfat dietinduced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (25). Emerging evidence has highlighted that FGF21 may serve as a potent regulator of skeletal homeostasis (26). In a Han Chinese population, a significant inverse correlation is observed between plasma FGF21 levels and bone mineral density (BMD) of the femoral neck and Ward's triangle (27). An increase in serum FGF21 levels is also negatively associated with BMD and bone mineral content in human immunodeficiency virus1infected patients (28). However, fasting plasma FGF21 levels in healthy women exhibit a strong positive association with total BMD and spine BMD (29). Notably, FGF21knockout in mice results in a highbonemass phenotype, whereas FGF21 gainoffunction decreases bone mass and promotes osteoclastogenesis (26,30). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of FGF21enhanced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption have not been completely clarified.
The present study screened the expression profile of miRNAs in the process of MCSF and RANKLinduced osteoclastogenesis using a miRNA microarray. The results demonstrated that miR1005p was downregulated and functioned as a negative regulator of osteoclastogenesis. miR1005p gainoffunction significantly suppressed osteoclast activity in vitro. In vivo, treatment with the agomirmiR1005p inhibited FGF21 expression and osteoclast activity, and prevented bone loss in mice following OVX.
Materials and methods
Cell culture. The present study was approved by the Animal Ethical Committee of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University (Shenyang, China; approval no. 2016PS361K). Murine bone marrowderived macrophages (BMMs) were obtained form female C57BL/6J mice, as described previously (31). BMMs were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium (HyClone; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Logan, UT, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) and 1% penicillinstreptomycin at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Nonadherent cells were cultured in MCSF (50 ng/ml; R&D Systems China Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) for 3 days to induce osteoclast precursors. For osteoclast differentiation, osteoclast precursors were incubated with MCSF (50 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml; R&D Systems China Co., Ltd.) for another 3 days (Fig. 1A). Osteoclasts with 3 nuclei/cell were identified as TRAPpositive cells. The NCTC1469 mouse normal liver cell line (serial number: 3111C0001CCC000290) was obtained from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences & National Infrastructure of Cell Line Resource (Shanghai, China). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) supplemented with 5% FBS, in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 and 95% air (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.).

Differentially expressed miRNAs in RANKLinduced osteoclast differentiation. Osteoclast differentiation was induced as shown in Fig. 1A. Subsequently, miRNA expression profiling of osteoclasts was conducted using the mouse miRNA expression profiling array V.2 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hierarchical clustering was performed to determine similarity using complete linkage and Euclidean distance using MeV software (version 4.2.6; http://mev.tm4.org/#/welcome) (32). The miRNAs with a foldchange of >2 in response to RANKLstimulated osteoclast differentiation compared with precursor cells were selected to determine the expression profile.
Animal model. Female C57BL/6J mice (age, 8 weeks; body weight, 20±2 g) were obtained from the Animal Center of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, and were allowed to acclimate for 1 week in a temperaturecontrolled environment (25±2°C; humidity, 55±5%) under an artificial 12h light/dark cycle with free access to food and tap water. Mice were randomly divided into four groups (n=6/group) and underwent either sham operation or bilateral OVX. AgomirmiR1005p (5'AACCCGUAGAUCCGAACUUGU G3') and control agomir (agomirCon; 5'AGUUUAGCU AACGGUGAGCCGA3') were purchased from Guangzhou RiboBio Co. Ltd. Surgical operations were performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg/kg; SigmaAldrich; Merck KGaA) by intraperitoneal injection. The sham group received the same surgical operation as the OVX group without ovariectomy, whereas mice in the OVX group the ovaries were excised. The groups were as follows: i) Sham group, shamoperated mice were treated with normal saline; ii) OVX group, OVXoperated mice were treated with normal saline; iii) OVX + agomirCon group, OVXoperated mice were treated with agomirCon; iv) OVX + agomirmiR group, OVXoperated mice were treated with agomirmiR1005p (100 mg/kg) via a tail vein injection. After a 4week treatment with the agomirs (twice/week), mice were euthanized and blood was harvested from the heart. Serum, liver and tibia samples were immediately collected and maintained at 80°C for further analysis.
Reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR). Total RNA was extracted from RANKLstimulated precursor cells, NCTC1469 cells, and liver and tibia samples using TRIzol® (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT was performed using TaqMan® reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. miR1005p was detected using TaqMan® MicroRNA assay (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The thermocycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 60 sec. U6 small nuclear RNA was used as an endogenous control. Relative miR1005p expression levels were calculated using the 2Cq method (33).
In addition, 2 µg total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA with moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the

Cell transfection and plasmid constructs. PremiRcontrol (PremiRCon) and premiR1005p were synthesized by Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). Osteoclast precursors (1x105) were seeded in 6well plates and transfected with premiRCon (5'AGUUUAGCUAACGGUGAGC CGA3') or premiR1005p (5'AACCCGUAGAUCCGAACU UGUG3') using Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientifc, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) for 48 h at 37°C at final concentrations of 100 nM, according to the manufacturer's protocol.
TRAP staining. RANKLstimulated precursor cells and tibia samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and 24 h, respectively, at room temperature. Tibia histological sections (5 µm) were obtained following decalcification in 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) and were embedded in paraffin, according to standard histological procedures. RANKLstimulated precursor cells and tibia histological sections were stained for TRAP activity using a 0.1 M acetate solution (pH 5.0) containing 6.76 mM sodium tartrate, 0.1 mg/ml naphthol ASMX phosphate and 0.5 mg/ml Fast Red Violet. The TRAP staining kit was purchased from SigmaAldrich; Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). TRAPpositive multinucleated cells with three or more nuclei were scored and visualized under

a microscope (Leica DM 2500; Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany).
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Tibias were fixed with 4% formalin at room temperature for 24 h, decalcified in 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) and were then embedded in paraffin, according to standard histological procedures. Tibia tissues were cut into 5 µm sections, which were stained with H&E (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stained slides were visualized under an optical microscope (Leica DM 2500; Leica Microsystems GmbH) and were analyzed using the OsteoMeasure system (OsteoMetrics Inc., Decatur, GA, USA).
Bone Ca content and BMD. Ca content in the tibia was determined following incineration of the samples using a muffle furnace (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) at 800°C for 12 h. Subsequently, 10 mg bone ash was dissolved in 1 ml 37% HCl diluted with MilliQ® water. The Ca content was determined using a kit (cat. no. C0043; Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The BMD of the tibia was measured by dualenergy Xray absorptiometry (Lunar DPXIQ; GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA), as described previously (34).
Physiological and biochemical markers in serum and urine samples. The levels of FGF21 in mouse serum were detected using a mouse bioactive ELISA kit (cat. no.

differences were analyzed by oneway analysis of variance, followed by a post hoc Tukey test for multiple comparisons. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Results
miR1005p is downregulated during RANKL and MCSFinduced osteoclastogenesis. BMMs were initially cultured in MCSF (50 ng/ml) for 3 days to induce formation of osteoclast precursors, which were stimulated by MCSF (50 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml) for a further 3 days to induce osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 1A). A miRNA microarray analysis was conducted to determine the molecular mechanism involved in RANKL and MCSFinduced osteoclastogenesis. The results demonstrated that 31 miRNAs were differentially expressed in osteoclast precursors with RANKL stimulation, compared with in those without RANKL stimulation, among

which 13 and 18 miRNAs were downregulated and upregulated, respectively (Fig. 1B). The expression levels of miR1005p were most significantly decreased in RANKLstimulated cells. In addition, the expression of miR1005p was validated by RTqPCR; the results were consistent with the microarray analysis and indicated that expression was decreased in a timedependent manner in response to RANKL and MCSFinduced osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the protein expression levels of TRAP were significantly augmented during the process of osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 1D).
Overexpression of miR1005p suppresses RANKL and MCSFinduced osteoclastogenesis. To investigate the function of miR1005p in vitro, premiR1005p was transfected into osteoclast precursors, in order to amplify the expression of miR1005p; the results revealed a significant upregulation (~120fold) of miR1005p in osteoclast precursors (Fig. 2A). Posttransfection with premiR1005p, the

key transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis, NFATc1 (Fig. 2B), and osteoclastspecific genes, Ctsk (Fig. 2C), matrix metalloproteinase9 (MMP9) (Fig. 2D) and TRAP (Fig. 2E), were significantly decreased compared with in the premiRCon group. Furthermore, osteoclast differentiation (TRAPpositive multinucleated cells) was blocked by premiR1005p (Fig. 2F). These findings indicated that miR1005p, as a suppressor, may neutralize RANKL and MCSFinduced osteoclastogenesis.
AgomirmiR1005p blocks OVXinduced bone resorption. The present study also examined whether overexpression of miR1005p regulates bone metabolism in vivo. Osteoporotic status was induced by OVX in mice, and OVXoperated mice were administered agomirmiR1005p or agomirCon via a tail vein injection. ELISA analyses revealed that bone formation markers, ALP and osteocalcin, and bone resorption markers, TRAP5b and CTX, were downregulated and upregulated, respectively, in OVXoperated mice. Conversely, agomirmiR1005p treatment reversed OVXinduced marker alterations, with the exception of serum ALP (Table II).
RTqPCR analysis revealed that miR1005p levels were significantly downregulated in the tibia from OVXoperated mice compared with in the tibia from shamoperated mice, whereas in OVXoperated mice injected with agomirmiR1005p OVXinhibited miR1005p levels were markedly rescued in the tibia (Fig. 3A). Subsequently, the mRNA expression levels of osteoblastspecific genes [Runtrelated transcription factor 2 (Runx2), osterix, osteocalcin and ALP] were detected, and it was confirmed that these genes were reduced in the tibia from OVXoperated mice, whereas agomirmiR1005p administration in OVXoperated mice significantly upregulated the mRNA expression levels of Runx2, osterix, osteocalcin and ALP (Fig. 3B). Conversely, the mRNA ratio of RANKL/osteoprotegrin (OPG) was elevated in the tibia from OVXoperated mice, suggesting that an increase in osteoclast activity in OVXoperated mice may be associated with overactivation of RANKL availability; however, upregulation of the RANKL/OPG ratio was reversed by agomirmiR1005p administration in OVXoperated

mice (Fig. 3C). To further investigate whether miR1005p inhibited OVXinduced bone resorption, osteoclastspecific genes, NFATc1, Ctsk, MMP9, carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) and TRAP, were detected by RTqPCR; the results demonstrated that agomirmiR1005p treatment markedly abolished OVXinduced upregulation of osteoclastspecific genes in the tibia (Fig. 3D). In addition, as determined by western blotting, OVXoperated mice exhibited a significant increase in RANK, RANKL and NFATc1, whereas agomirmiR1005p administration decreased the protein expression levels of RANK, RANKL and NFATc1 in the tibia from OVXoperated mice(Fig. 3E and 3F).
Ca and P metabolism were also analyzed in OVXoperated mice in response to agomirmiR1005p administration. Compared with in agomirCon treated OVXoperated mice, agomirmiR1005p administration significantly increased serum Ca concentration and blocked urinary Ca secretion; however, the serum and urine levels of P were not markedly altered in response to OVX operation or agomirmiR1005p administration (Table II). Bone Ca content and tibia BMD were decreased by OVX and were increased by agomirmiR1005p administration in OVXoperated mice (Fig. 4A and B). Histomorphological observation by H&E staining revealed that the integrity of the trabecular bone microstructure network was destroyed in the proximal epiphysis of the tibia by OVX. However, agomirmiR1005p administration markedly improved trabecular bone structure and accelerated bone remodeling (Fig. 4C and D). Furthermore, the function of agomirmiR1005p on osteoclast differentiation was determined in vivo. TRAP staining revealed that the number of osteoclasts was increased by OVX, whereas osteoclast numbers were significantly decreased by agomirmiR1005p treatment (Fig. 4E and F). Collectively, these findings suggested that increased bone mass in agomirmiR1005padministered OVXoperated mice may be caused by a combination of increased bone formation and decreased bone resorption.

results revealed that miR1005p was significantly decreased in the liver of OVXoperated mice compared with in the shamoperated group, whereas agomirmiR1005p injection rescued OVXinduced downregulation of miR1005p expression in the liver (Fig. 5A). Consistent with previous findings (26,30), the present results indicated a significant increase in the mRNA expression (Fig. 5B), serum levels (Fig. 5C) and protein expression (Fig. 5D and E) of FGF21 in the liver of OVXoperated mice. Notably, both liver and serum FGF21 levels were suppressed by agomirmiR1005p injection in OVXoperated mice (Fig. 5BE).
To further investigate whether FGF21 is a direct target of miR1005p, the online prediction software TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.org/vert_72/) was used to predict the association between miR1005p and FGF21. It was revealed that the 3'UTR of FGF21 contained one conserved binding site for miR1005p, which was presented as a complementary

pairing (Fig. 6A). To confirm this finding, luciferase reporter plasmids containing WT or MUT 3'UTR of FGF21 were cotransfected with premiRCon and premiR1005p into the NCTC1469 mouse normal liver cell line. The results revealed that the luciferase activity was reduced by ~60% in cells transfected with plasmids containing WT 3'UTR of FGF21 and premiR1005p; however, premiR1005p had no effect on luciferase activity in cells transfected with plasmids containing MUT 3'UTR of FGF21 (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, to identify the action of miR1005p on FGF21, NCTC1469 cells were transfected with premiRCon or premiR1005p and the mRNA and protein expression levels of FGF21 were measured. Compared with in the premiRCon group, overexpression of miR1005p significantly downregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of FGF21 (Fig. 6C and D). These findings suggested that FGF21 may be a direct target of miR1005p.

Based on the aforementioned findings, it was revealed that miR1005p was inhibited during the process of osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in OVXinduced bone loss in vivo. FGF21, as a potential proosteoclastogenic liver hormone, may be involved in RANKL/RANK/NFATc1 cascade

signalingmediated osteoclast differentiation, whereas agomirmiR1005p, as a posttranscriptional regulatory factor targeted to the FGF21/RANKL/RANK/NFATc1 pathway, may block osteoclastogenesis and OVXinduced bone loss (Fig. 7).

Discussion
The present study confirmed that the expression of miR1005p was downregulated during RANKLinduced osteoclastogenesis, as determined by microarray and RTqPCR analyses. miR1005p gainoffunction markedly inhibited the process of osteoclast differentiation and negatively regulated osteoclast function by suppressing the mRNA expression levels of osteoclastspecific genes in vitro. The present results also suggested that Ca metabolism and trabecular bone remodeling were improved, and osteoclast differentiation and activity were decreased by agomirmiR1005p in OVXoperated mice. Furthermore, as a crucial liver hormone, FGF21 was upregulated and involved in OVXinduced bone resorption. Notably, agomirmiR1005p abrogated OVXinduced upregulation of FGF21 in the liver and serum; FGF21 was validated as a direct target of miR1005p by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase activity assay. Overexpression of miR1005p resulted in the downregulation of FGF21 mRNA and protein expression in NCTC1469 cells. Based on these findings, it was suggested that agomirmiR1005p alleviated osteoclast differentiation and bone loss by blocking liversecreted FGF21; FGF21 may lead to overactivation of the RANKL/RANK/NFATc1 signaling pathway, thus mediating osteoclastic bone resorption.
miRNAs are posttranscriptional regulators that mediate the expression of bone metabolismassociated genes at transcriptional and translational levels (911,13). For example, overexpression of miR503 prevents bone resorption and osteoclast activity in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting RANK expression (11). miR34a, as a key osteoclast suppressor, blocks osteoporosis by suppressing transforming growth factorinduced factor 2 in mice (9). Furthermore, miR214 leads to a decline in bone formation by inhibiting activating transcription factor 4 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (10,13). These results suggested that a regulatory mechanism including numerous miRNAs, or one miRNA, may target various genes involved in the process of osteoclastogenesis and bone loss (911,13). A previous study reported that miR100 modulates human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation into osteoblasts, and promotes osteogenesis in response to mechanical stress (36). Conversely, miR100 serves a negative role in osteogenic differentiation derived from human adiposederived MSCs by targeting bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (18). The present study revealed that downregulation of miR1005p was accompanied by an increase in the expression levels of FGF21 in the liver samples of OVXoperated mice. Further investigations indicated that FGF21 was a direct target of miR1005p, which could inhibit FGF21 levels in the serum and liver; osteoclast activity and bone loss were suppressed by agomirmiR1005p injection in OVXoperated mice. These observations provided an insight into liverbone endocrine signaling and suggested that miR1005p targeted FGF21 to inhibit its hepatic expression and contributed to the regeneration of bone under pathophysiological conditions.
FGF21 is a hepatokine that is mainly expressed in the liver (26,30). FGF21 is considered a potential novel drug for the treatment of obesity and diabetes by potentiating the effect

of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor  (PPAR) (37). Furthermore, FGF21 inhibits osteoblastogenesis from MSCs and stimulates osteoclastogenesis from hematopoietic stem cells by activating PPAR, whereas bone mass is markedly restored by FGF21 deletion (26,37). A previous study (36), and the present findings, revealed that miR1005p exerted an opposite effect to FGF21 on osteoclast differentiation. A functional study revealed that FGF21 was a direct target of miR1005p, and agomirmiR1005p effectively blocked FGF21 secretion from the liver, inhibited osteoclastogenesis and osteoclastspecific gene expression, and stimulated bone formation and osteoblastspecific gene expression. FGF21 was inducible in the liver but absent in the bone, thus suggesting that FGF21stimulated osteoclast differentiation and bone loss may be mediated via a liverbone endocrine metabolic mechanism in OVXoperated mice.
In conclusion, the present results demonstrated that alterations in the expression levels of miR1005p may lead to an alteration in bone homeostasis and osteoclast differentiation. These phenomena may be associated with the hepatokine FGF21. The present experimental evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies strongly indicated that miR1005p could prevent bone resorption and osteoclastogenesis, at least partially, through inhibition of FGF21 secretion from the liver. This finding may provide a novel insight into the management of osteoporosis and osteoclastassociated bone diseases.

Purpose: Screening preschool children for visionrelated disorders poses a challenge. This study is designed to determine the agreement and diagnostic accuracy of the spot vision screener (SVS) in screening preschool children compared to screening procedure by vision technicians (VT). Methods: This study was conducted as a part of the ongoing study titled "Initiative for Screening Children for Refractive Errors and other Eye Health Needs (ISCREEN)." Children from 33 Anganwadis (preschools) in two districts, Adilabad district of Telangana and Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, in South India, underwent eye health screening by a VT and by a trained community eye health workers (CEHW) using the SVS. Findings were compared for agreement and diagnostic accuracy of assessment. Results: A total of 976 preschool children were screened by the VT and separately by the CEHW using the SVS in Adilabad (15 schools) and Krishna (18 schools) districts. The overall mean age of these children was 2.5 years (SD ± 1.3 years). There were 48 (4.9%) referrals by VT compared to 105 (10.8%) referrals by CEHW using SVS. The overall sensitivity of SVS was 91.7% (95% CI: 80%-97.7%) and the specificity was 93.4% (95% CI: 91.6%-94.9%). Positive predictive value was 41.9% (95% CI: 32.3%-51.9%) and negative predictive value was 99.5% (95% CI: 98.8%-99.9%) with a moderate agreement (0.54; 95% CI 0.49-0.64) between VT screening and screening with SVS. Conclusion: The SVS showed good diagnostic accuracy and agreement in screening for possible visionrelated disorders in preschool children.

Vision screening in preschool children poses specific challenges due to the difficulty in measuring vision in these children. It has been shown that in order to increase awareness of vision problems/refractive error in this age group, it is essential to screen preschool children.[1] The US Preventative Services Task Force now actively recommends vision screening at least once for children between 36 months and 5 years of age and states explicitly that photo screening is an appropriate screening technology.[2] Early detection of a higher degree of refractive error may prevent amblyopia in children at risk and allow for simple refractive correction rather than active therapies at an age when amblyopia has not yet become entrenched. Therefore, major professional organizations concerned with children's vision and childhood blindness, including the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the American Association for Paediatrics Ophthalmology and Strabismus, and the American Association of Certified Orthoptists, have recommended

that vision screening should begin in early childhood.[3] According to a study by Joish et al., the net benefit to society was the greatest when vision screening was performed in preschool children compared to schoolage children.[4] Forcina et al. demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity of a photoscreener for detecting amblyopia risk factors in children aged 6 months to 35 months.[5] Children with amblyopia risk factors who underwent photo screening before 2 years of age have better visual outcomes than those screened later.[6] Early correction of refractive error is also known to improve visual acuity outcomes.[7]
Given the limitations of chartbased vision screening, several professional groups recommend replacing its use in young children with instrumentbased screening using portable photoscreeners or autorefractors. In a 2016 policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics, experts indicated that instrumentbased vision screening can be attempted beginning at 12 months of age in a community setting.[5] Numerous photoscreener devices have been used, and the current generation devices demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity relative to a gold standard comprehensive eye exam.[5,813] In

a cluster randomized trial conducted in Boston to test the implementation of instrumentbased screening compared to chartbased screening in children aged 3 to 5 years, completion of screening increased from 39% with chartbased screening to 87% with instrument screening. Instrumentbased screening was also associated with 15% reduction in referrals in eye care.[8] Most of these devices have been used in a clinical setting and there is no data on its accuracy when used in populationbased studies in developing countries in a community setting.
Our study was specifically designed to look at the diagnostic accuracy of screening with the spot vision screener (SVS) in preschool children as compared to screening by a vision technician (VT) in a community setting, i.e., compare two screening modalities. The Welch Allyn Spot Vision Screener; model VS100 is a photoscreener that is a noninvasive, portable instrument which captures vision data for both eyes in all age groups. It also measures pupil size, interpupillary distance, and gaze deviation. This instrument helps in identifying patients requiring further eye examinations as referrals for significant refractive error, anisometropia, anisocoria, and strabismus.[3,1315] The advantage of using an instrumentbased screening device is the ease of its applicability to the pediatric primary care setting without specialized training. It can also be used easily in preverbal children, children who are preliterate, and those with developmental delays.[8,16]
Methods
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of L V Prasad Eye Institute and followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. This study is a part of the larger ongoing project on the "Initiative for Screening Children for Refractive Errors and other Eye Health Needs (ISCREEN)." ISCREEN is being carried out in four districts in two Indian states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh [Fig. 1].[17] The L V Prasad Eye Institute pyramidal model for eye care delivery consists of a centre of excellence at the top catering to 50 million population followed by tertiary centres, each for 5 million population. At the next level, there are secondary centres covering 0.5-1 million population, followed by vision centres at primary level for 50,000 population, and vision guardians for 5,000 population. The functions at each level of the pyramid are clearly delineated and demarcated. The secondary centres are run by one or two ophthalmologists who are trained at

tertiary centres or centre of excellence for a year. Patients from secondary centres are referred to tertiary centres or centre of excellence only for advanced care and management of complex problems. The vision centres are staffed by a VT.[18] VT are eyecare personnel who run primary vision centres. They are the local youth who have completed high school, and are trained for 2 years to provide primary eye care, including a basic eye examination, refraction, dispensing spectacles, and appropriate referrals. A VT helps in identifying common eye conditions that can cause vision loss in children. The VT training programme has been accredited by the National Skill Development Council of India.[19]
This study involved screening of all children in preschools (Anganwadis) in Adilabad and Krishna districts. As a part of the Integrated Child Development Scheme, the Government of India started "The Anganwadi Program" in 1975. The program caters to children in the 0-6 years age group.[20] Written informed consent was obtained from the person in charge (Anganwadi teacher/worker) at each Anganwadi, after explaining the importance of the current study. A copy of the consent form was provided for their records.
In a comprehensive school eye health program (ISCREEN), the key is to screen all preschoolers and schoolgoing children with the help of trained VT.[17,21,22] In order to reach preschool and schoolgoing children in remote rural parts of the country, a screening procedure is required that can be replicated across the country. In this study, we utilized community eye health workers (CEHW) for screening rural areas. However, they too have difficulty in screening preschool children. As it is difficult to have ophthalmologists or optometrists in rural areas, we identified VT for conducting screening these preschool children as initial step. As it was difficult to have VT at all Anganwadis as well as perform cycloplegic refraction for all children in community setting, there was a need for an alternative method. Hence, CEHW were provided with SVS and trained to use SVS for screening. This study compares the diagnostic accuracy of screening with SVS which compared to the screening by VT for the same preschool children.
For testing the accuracy of the SVS in our study, 15 Anganwadis in the districts of Adilabad and 18 Anganwadis in Krishna were randomly selected. All children in these preschools were screened by three VTs (two in Adilabad district and one in Krishna district). The same children were screened by a CEHW using SVS. There was a good agreement between these VTs for screening preschool children (overall kappa between VT1 and VT2 was 0.72, VT1 and VT3 was 0.68, and VT2 and VT3 was 0.76). The protocol for screening by VTs included collecting demographic information related to each child from the Anganwadi records. For vision testing, different vision tests were used depending on the age and response of the child. Initially, 6/12 tumbling E optotypes or an alphabet chart was used and if the child had difficulty, HOTV or a Lea symbol chart was used at a distance of 3 m, in ambient illumination. If a child could not understand any of these, finger puppets were used to assess the fixation pattern. In addition to this, distant direct ophthalmoscopy was done to rule out media opacities. The children with one or a combination of the factors, such as failure in vision screening and/or absence of red glow, were referred to the next level of care, i.e., secondary centre, where there is an ophthalmologist and cycloplegic refraction could be

performed. Data was collected in prescribed forms. The study coordinator collected and verified the completed forms before forwarding them for data entry.
The same children were then screened by a CEHW using the SVS on the same day. To assess the child, the CEHW holds the SVS approximately three feet from the child, and twinkling lights and sounds provide a fixation target for the child. With a cooperative child in a dimly lit room, a reading is obtained in about 2 seconds. If the reading was not obtained in the initial attempt, several attempts were made until they succeeded. With a successful reading, the device immediately displays a report of the pupillary diameter, ocular alignment, binocular refraction, and a recommendation for a referral.[5] Depending on the result obtained on the SVS, the child was designated as "not referred" or "referred." The VT and CEHW were masked to the results of each other during screening. The entire process was overseen by a local coordinator who also ensured that all of the examiners were masked to the findings of each other. Findings of the VTs were compared against findings of SVS for agreement and diagnostic accuracy.
Sensitivity was defined as the ability of the SVS to recommend referral for further eye examination among those who were referred by the VT; and specificity was defined as the ability of SVS to recommend no referral for those children confirmed as normal by the VT. Positive predictive value (PPV) was defined as the proportion of children who were recommended referral by SVS as compared those identified by the VT, and the negative predictive value (NPV) was defined as the proportion of children who were not recommended referral among those found to be normal by the VT.
Agreement (kappa statistic) and diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values) were calculated comparing the final SVS data with the reference standard of the VTs. Agreement was graded as poor (<0.2), fair (0.21-0.4), moderate (0.41-0.60), good (0.61-0.8), and excellent (0.81-1.0).
Results
A total of 976 preschool children were screened by both the VT and the CHEW using SVS from 33 Anganwadi schools in Adilabad (15) and Krishna (18) districts. In Adilabad district, 375 (38.4%) children were screened and in Krishna, 601 (61.6%) children were screened. The overall mean age of these children was 2.5 years (SD ± 1.3 years). There were 477 (48.9%) girls and 499 (51.1%) boys.
Table 1 shows the referrals by VT as well as the CEHW using SVS in both the districts and the total. Overall, there were 48 cases (4.9%) referred by VT and 105 cases (10.8%) referred by CEHWs using SVS.
Table 2 shows the diagnostic accuracy of the VTs with that of the SVS, in both districts. The overall sensitivity of the SVS in screening and referring a child was 91.7% (95% CI: 80%-97.7%) and the specificity was 93.4% (95% CI: 91.6%-94.9%). The overall PPV was found to be 41.9% (95% CI: 32.3%-51.9%) and the NPV was 99.5% (95% CI: 98.8%-99.9%). There was moderate agreement (0.54; 95% CI 0.49-0.64) between VT and SVS in both districts with moderate agreement in Krishna district (0.46; 95% CI 0.34-0.58) and good agreement in Adilabad district (0.71; 95% CI 0.57-0.85).

Discussion
This is one of the first populationbased studies in a developing country comparing the diagnostic accuracy of an instrumentbased screening device in preschool children with screening by a VT in a community setting. The SVS showed high sensitivity and specificity in screening for visionrelated abnormalities in preschool children. The overall sensitivity and specificity of SVS for screening were found to be good and comparable with other studies where pediatric ophthalmologist was used [Table 3].[5,9,11,13]
In terms of predictive values, the overall PPV was 41.9%, and NPV was 99.5%. Very few studies have reported PPVs and NPVs in addition to sensitivity and specificity.[5,9,11] Forcina et al. from South Carolina reported a PPV of 58.9% and NPV of 93.6%. However, they had a small sample of 184 children, and the overall prevalence of an eye condition was 32.1%. Using a prevalence of 20% of the children with an amblyopia risk factor, the PPV and NPV were estimated to be 43.1% and 96.5%, respectively.[5] Similarly, Arana Mendez reported a PPV of 58.1% and NPV on 98.9% in a sample of 219 children, and the overall prevalence of any eye condition was more than 50%.[9] Peterseim et al. reported a PPV and NPV of more than 80% and the overall prevalence of any eye condition was 59%. However, with a population prevalence of 20%, the PPV was 48% and NPV was 96%.[11] In our populationbased study, the overall prevalence of referral was 4.9%. As PPV is dependent on the prevalence of any eye condition, the low prevalence in our population can explain the difference in PPVs from other studies. Apart from this, all these studies the gold standard was cycloplegic refraction by an optometrist or pediatric ophthalmologist. In our study, it was comparing one screening method versus other as it was difficult to have optometrist screen in rural setting as well as cycloplegic refraction could not be performed on these children due to lack of consent from parents as well as associated complications with performing cycloplegia in the field.

This study concluded with a moderate agreement between the VTs and SVS. The reason for a moderate agreement could be related to the low prevalence of visionrelated abnormality in our population as well no cycloplegic refraction being performed. However, we could not find an explanation for moderate agreement between VT and SVS in Krishna district and good agreement in Adilabad district and this need further exploration.
One of the limitations of this study was that screening was not done with cycloplegic refraction in these children and we might have missed number of children with hyperopia. While the VT could identify only 48 children with ocular morbidity, the SVS could identify 105. It is likely that some of them could have been hyperopic and missed by the VT. Hence, as a next step, it is proposed to do a compare the accuracy of SVS with a cycloplegic refraction by a pediatric optometrist or an ophthalmologist as the gold standard.
A positive outcome of our study was that screening a large number of preschool children with reasonable accuracy and without depending on trained personnel was shown to be a possibility, which would not have been conceivable in the past.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the importance of screening preschool children, to identify those at risk of refractive error and amblyopia, has been emphasized often. Most of time, screening at

the primary care level is compromised due to inadequate number of trained vision technicians (VT) or availability of optometrist and a large percentage of children not attending school. The cost of detecting and treating amblyopia is quite reasonable, with a ratio of cost to qualityadjusted life years for amblyopia screening estimated at $6,000 which is significantly less than that of other screening (e.g., screening for diabetic retinopathy).[13] The SVS system is a useful alternative for remote locations to provide eye care services for children who have no access to or are unable to access care.[23] SVS has proven to be a useful tool, as it is portable, and a quick and easy to operate. A high sensitivity index makes it a reliable tool for replacing VT at least at the screening level. However, it should be understood that, at this point, it is just a screening modality and not a replacement of a cycloplegic refraction done by an optometrist or pediatric ophthalmologist and a further study is warranted to compare the accuracy of SVS with a cycloplegic refraction by a pediatric optometrist or an ophthalmologist as the gold standard.

Commentary: Agreement and diagnostic accuracy of vision screening in preschool children between vision technicians and spot vision screener
The development of normal vision in human is the result of progression from the rudimentary sensory feedback of lower vertebrates to the advanced binocular cortical vision and conjugate eye movements of higher primates. In ethnologically lesser advanced organisms, the type of binocular vision relies completely upon the dissociated position of the eyes, which are divergent with regard to each other, the body, and the head. Inward development of the orbits and eyes from disparate positions on the head to frontal location in the face has turned

into a single binocular stereovision as a acclimation ability in higher vertebrates like humans.[1]
For the development of normal visual acuity, both the retina needs to be exposed to a focused image from birth to nine years of age. Initially the infants at birth has a visual acuity of 20/1200 and on exposure to regular and equally consistent visual stimuli it improves to a normal visual acuity of 20/20. In the presence of natural visual stimuli blockage by high difference in refractive power between two eyes (anisometropia), hindrance of the visual axis (deprivation), or improperly aligned visual axis (squint), binocular single vision evolution is deterred resulting in amblyopia.[1,2]
So early visual assessment in children is of utmost importance to rule out any ocular abnormality possibly arresting proper visual acuity development. This also helps in timely management of any treatable pathology. But it is easier said than done, to measure visual acuity in childhood

Effects of Maharishi Yoga Asanas on Mood States, Happiness, and Experiences during Meditation

Abstract Context/Background: Many studies showed positive effects of Yoga Asanas. There is no study on Maharishi Yoga Asanas yet. This research replicated and expanded observed improvements on the profile of mood states (POMS) as a result of 2week Maharishi Yoga Asanas course. Thirteen college students taking part in a 4week course on Maharishi Yoga Asanas were matched with 13 students taking other courses at the university. Aims and Objective: The main objective of the study was to assess the effects of Maharishi Yoga Asanas on mood states, degree of happiness, and experiences in Transcendental Meditation (TM) practice. Methods: All students were given two psychological tests and additional question before and after their 4week course: POMS, Meditation Depth Questionnaire, and question about the degree of happiness. Results: Repeated measure MANOVA showed the 4week Maharishi Yoga Asanas course resulted in significant increase in happiness during the day and significant improvements in (1) sense of personal self, (2) transpersonal qualities, and (3) transpersonal self during their TM practice. Conclusion: This research shows that Maharishi Yoga Asanas affect more than body and mind. Rather they influence much deeper levels of one's subjectivity including one's transpersonal self.

Introduction
Research has investigated interventions, such as yoga asanas (poses), pranayama (breath control), rest, and purification techniques on the functioning of mind and body. A common finding is that these practices improved mood states and emotional wellbeing.[15] A national survey of yoga practitioners showed that Iyengar Yoga increased energy and happiness, improved social relationships and sleep, and reduced body weight.[6] Better sleep has also been reported by practitioners of Gentle Yoga,[2] Tibetan Yoga,[7] Silver Yoga,[8] Kundalini Yoga,[9] Gentle Hatha and Restorative Yoga Asana,[10] Mindful Yoga,[11] Hatha Yoga,[12] Sudarshan Kriya Yoga,[13] TaiChi/Yoga,[14] and longterm yoga practitioners.[15]
Practice of yoga asanas reduced fatigue and improved mood status,[16] enhanced emotional wellbeing,[17,18] and quality of life.[1921] It improved emotional function[22] and decreased emotional irritability,[23] decreased fatigue,[24] and increased vitality.[25] Controlled studies

showed that asanas, breathing, and meditation practices significantly decreased anxiety, depression, and perceived stress.[26,27]
Several studies reported that Integrated Yoga[28,29] and Hatha Yoga[30] increased satisfaction in life. Wood[31] found that breath control and asana practice produced a marked increase in alertness and enthusiasm. These practices positively change one's personality. A recent study found that Hatha Yoga practice "brings a positive transformation in the personality traits, especially conscientiousness."[25]
There is no research, yet, on Maharishi Yoga Asanas. In contrast to most other yoga asana practices, which involve at least some degree of effort, Maharishi Yoga Asanas are practiced in a slow and comfortable pace, with no strain required. The aim of Maharishi Yoga Asanas is to turn the attention within. Maharishi Yoga Asanas are considered to be preparation for Transcendental Meditation© (TM) practice, which follows.

Maharishi Yoga Asanas typically include lying (supine and prone), inverting, kneeling, sitting, standing, and balancing postures as well as all possible six movements of the spine: axial extension (lengthening), flexion (bending forward), lateral flexion (bending sideways), extension (backward bending), and axial rotation (twisting). The set starts in a sitting pose with resolution to begin asana practice and to continue with tone up, followed by rolling on the back from side to side. Three more asanas are done on the back involving moving or lifting the legs. Next is the shoulder stand. Then, there is the "bridge," followed by two asanas on the stomach. Next two asanas are done from a kneeling pose, and then, two sitting asanas, one includes rotating the spine. The last is a standing pose.
Between each asana, there is Shavasana (lying pose) which helps with normalizing of breathing and blood circulation and contributes to settling down the body and mind. During practice of Maharishi Yoga Asanas, eyes are usually closed and the attention is on the sensations in the body as well as general awareness. As the practice progresses, the practitioners usually experience "letting go" or momentarily expansion of awareness. This signifies the experience of the state of yoga - the union of body, mind, and spirit.
The sequence ends with pranayama and is followed by TM practice, which is practiced in comfortable sitting position with eyes closed for 20 min. TM involves effortless transcending active thoughts and perceptions to the state when the mind is quiet and awake.[32]
Experiment I: Pilot Study
The pilot study investigated the effects of Maharishi Yoga Asanas on mood states and resilience. Mood states and resilience were selected since the majority of research on other forms of yoga report improvements in emotional wellbeing.
Methods
Subjects
The participants in the pilot study were 12 individuals, 7 men and 5 women. They were healthy and did not report significant mental or physical complaints. Their age ranged from 20 to 40 years (average 25.3 ± 5.2 years). All participants were students at Maharishi University of Management, where they practice TM in groups twice a day. Years of practice of TM ranged from 1 to 3 years (average 2.4 ± 1.4 years). All the students had received a onesession introduction to Maharishi Yoga Asanas in their first course at Maharishi University of Management.
The structure of the 2week class was 1 h of theory followed by 45-50 min of Maharishi Yoga Asanas. The theory consisted of basics and principles about yoga and

yogabased lifestyle according to Maharishi's teaching. There were 14 yoga asana sessions in 8 days, one in the morning and one in the afternoon; 2 days only included one session in the morning.
Test measures
Students were given the two pencil and paper psychological tests the week before the course began and were posttested with the same measures a few days after the course ended.
Profile of mood states
Profile of mood states (POMS) is a "wellknown, wellvalidated, reliable, and internally consistent selfreport questionnaire."[9] It consists of 65 adjectives rated on a fivepoint scale. There are subscale scores for six mood states: tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion. A combination of subscale scores gives total mood disturbance score.[33]
Resilience scale for adults
Resilience is a "personality characteristic that moderates the negative effects of stress and promotes adaptation."[34] It has become an umbrella term to cover many aspects of overcoming adversity and adapting to one's environment.[34] The resilience scale for adults (RSA) has 33 items covering six dimensions assessing protective factors at multiple levels: (1) Perception of self, (2) planned future, (3) social competence, (4) structured style, (5) family cohesion, and (6) social resources. The four first factors assess protective factors at a personal level, and the two latter factors assess protective factors at a family and a social level.
Data analysis
Profile of mood states
POMS questionnaire asks participants to describe how they feel right now by circling a number after each of the 65 words. The numbers ranged from "not at all" (1) to "extremely" (5).
Resilience scale for adults
The RSA scale has 33 series of phrases with two statements on either side of five boxes. The participants were asked to check one of the five boxes that were closest to how the statement fits them. The 33 phrases are divided into these six categories: 1. Personal strength/perception of self, 2. Personal strength/perception of future, 3. Structured style, 4. Social competence, 5. Family cohesion, and 6. Social resources.
Statistical analysis
SPSS, version 13.0 was used to analyze the data, employing t-tests to assess pre/postdifferences on total Mood

disturbance and total resilience. Statistical significance and effect sizes are reported for these measures.
Results and Discussion
Ten out of twelve participants completed the course. Two of them dropped the course due to medical reasons. One student did not answer the second half of the POMS questionnaire. For nine participants, the data were complete and statistical tests were conducted on those data.
Effects of Maharishi Yoga Asanas on mood
There was a strong trend for lower total mood disturbance from pre to posttest (t (8) =1.77, P = 0.06). The effect size was d = 0.7. This is a medium effect size [Table 1].
Effects of Maharishi Yoga Asanas on resilience
There were no significant differences on the six resilience measures. The effect size for the total resilience was small (d = 0.2). According to Cohen's power tables, 84 subjects would be needed to reach statistical significance with this level of effect size.
The results of the pilot test suggest that yoga practice effects mood states more than behaviors such as resilience. The next study expanded these findings by testing a control group and using additional measures of emotional states as well as meditation experience.
Experiment II
In the next study, we again administered the POMS. In addition, we administered a standardized measure of depth of meditation experience and a question about the degree of happiness. A measure of depth of meditation was used because subjects in the pilot study reported better experiences during their TM practice when they began to practice Maharishi Yoga Asanas more regularly. The RSA was not used in the second study because the effect sizes were very small in the pilot test.
Methods
Subjects
Thirteen college students taking part in a 4week course on Maharishi Yoga Asanas were matched with 13 students taking other courses at the university. All the subjects were healthy and did not report significant mental or physical complaints. The subjects were matched on age, gender, and years of practicing the TM technique. The subjects in the experimental group were an average

age of 31.2 ± 15.0 years and the subjects in the control group were an average age of 27.8 ± 11.0 years. They had been practicing TM for in average of 7.9 ± 11.9 years and 9.5 ± 12.5, respectively. There was no significant differences in age or length of time TM practice at pretest (both F(1,25) <1.0, ns).
Procedure
All students were given the two psychological tests before and after their course: POMS and Meditation Depth Questionnaire (MEDEQ). They were also asked to rate their level of happiness. The experimental group participated in a 1month course on Maharishi Yoga Asanas after the baseline test. The control group participated in other academic classes at the university.
The structure of the 4week Maharishi Yoga Asanas course was similar to the structure of the 2week course tested during the pilot study. There were two classes a day, one in the morning 10-12 am and one after lunch 1-3:15 pm. In every class, there was a lesson about the theory behind Maharishi Yoga Asanas followed by Maharishi Yoga Asanas (45-50 min each time). We contacted the students before the class and gave them the baseline tests.
The control subjects were students at other 4week classes at the university. They were contacted before their class and agreed to take part in the study. They were given the three baseline measures. After the course was finished, the students were contacted within 3-7 days and given the same three measures at posttest.
Test instruments
The profile of mood states
The POMS is widely used to assess mood states.[35] The total mood disturbance score is calculated by adding the five negative subscale scores (tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion) and subtracting the vigor score. Higher scores for the total mood disturbance score indicate a greater degree of mood disturbance.[36]
Degree of happiness question
The subjects were asked to rate how happy they see themselves, using a 7-point Likert scale (from 1 = not a very happy person to 7 = a very happy person).
Meditation Depth Questionnaire
The MEDEQ is a selfreport questionnaire measuring the depth of meditative experiences. Through cluster analysis, Piron[37] classified meditative experiences into five stages along a dimension of increasing depth: Hindrances, relaxation, personal self, transpersonal qualities, and transpersonal Self. Hindrances cover difficulties in meditation such as restlessness, busy mind, laziness, or feeling bored. Relaxation comprises smooth breathing, feeling well, patience, and calmness. Personal self covers experiences such as being aware of one's own center,

68

International Journal of Yoga | Volume 11 | Issue 1 | JanuaryApril 2018

Gobec and Travis: Yoga, happiness, and meditation experience

feeling light, observing one's own thoughts, and intuitive insights. Transpersonal qualities describe the experiences such as time disappearing, alert and clear mind, and feelings such as love, devotion, humility, acceptance, and joy. Transpersonal Self describes the experience of the unity of everything, expansion of the mind, and disappearance of cognitive processes.
Statistical analysis
SPSS was used to analyze the data. A repeated measures ANOVA tested group differences in total mood disturbance and the response on the happiness question. A repeated measures MANOVAs tested the five components of the depth of meditation questionnaire. Statistical significance and effect sizes are reported for all measures.
Results
Group differences in emotional state
A repeated measure ANOVA yielded no significant group differences for changes in total mood disturbance from pre to posttest (F(1,24) = 1.5, P = 0.23). The effect sizes were smaller than in the pilot: d = 0.42. Table 2 presents the means, standard deviation, and effect sizes for the two groups.
A repeated measure ANOVA of the happiness question yielded a significant prepost x group interaction (F(1,24) = 4.53, P = 0.04). Table 3 presents the means, standard deviation, effect sizes, and P value for the two groups.
Group differences in depth of meditation
A repeated measures MANOVA including five categories of the depth of meditation questionnaire yielded a significant prepost x question interaction (F(4,21) = 4.00, P = 0.014) and significant prepost x group interaction (F(1,24) = 5.37, P = 0.029). Therefore, we conducted individual repeated measure ANOVA for each category. In this analysis, there were significantly higher values for the yoga group in the last three categories but not in the first two. Table 4 presents the means, standard deviation, effect sizes, and P value for the two groups.
Following Maharishi Yoga Asanas practice, the subjects in the yoga group reported deeper experiences during their subsequent TM session. This was indicated by increased experiences of transpersonal qualities and transpersonal Self during the TM session.
Discussion
This controlled study found that a 4week Maharishi Yoga Asanas course resulted in significant increases in degree of happiness during the day, and significant improvements in sense of personal self, transpersonal qualities, and transpersonal self during TM practice.

How Maharishi Yoga Asanas and Transcendental Meditation practice might improve mood
Both practices of Maharishi Yoga asanas and TM probably contributed to greater happiness during the day. Practice of yoga asanas stretches and strengthens the body in an easy and nonstressful way, improving one's strength, flexibility, and general wellbeing. Every asana creates a unique style of mindbody integration, or "steady pleasantness," which together result in greater balance in mind and body. Asana practice also cultures good posture as well as greater integration of the functioning of the left and right hemispheres of the brain. This greater sense of balance could provide a platform for greater balance of mind and body during day.
While asana practice optimizes balance and functioning of mind and body, TM practice changes how we evaluate our daily life. The process of transcending during TM practice gives the experience of a deeper, richer, more silent sense of self, that is, not as touched by the ups and downs of daily life.[38,39] This deeper inner experience allows the meditator to place ongoing experience into a larger context - they are

able to deal with stress and challenges better. Regular TM practice is associated with significant decreases in anxiety in normal subjects,[40] decreased total mood disturbance, and increased emotional and behavioral coping in college students[41] as well as decreases in posttraumatic stress symptoms in military[42,43] and civilian subjects.[44] The expansion of selfawareness during TM practice is also reflected in greater growth in selfdevelopment[45] and selfesteem.[46]
The current study was not designed to separate independent effects of Maharishi Yoga Asana practice and TM practice on happiness during the day. However, it is important to recognize that the control group was also part of a college curriculum that includes daily TM practice. Yet, the experimental group who added daily asana practice to their routine exhibited greater happiness. Thus, asanas seem to work synergistically with meditation practice to affect degree of happiness.
How Maharishi Yoga Asanas might improve the depth of meditation experience
Maharishi Yoga Asanas are performed at a slow pace, suitable to the individual, with eyes closed during most poses. Having the awareness inside creates a condition for the mind to transcend bodily sensations and expand to the state of yoga - union of body, mind, and spirit. That happens, especially while resting in a flat lying position, a pose performed after all other asanas, which restores homeostasis in the body and integrates the effects of each individual asana. Subjects often report during these resting poses (momentary) experiences of the state of yoga - the state of union of body, mind, and spirit.
Practice of Maharishi Yoga Asanas is an optimal preparation for body and mind to transcend thoughts and mental processes during subsequent TM practice. Stresses in the mind or body (mental or physical pain, for example) keep the mind on the surface and disallow transcending.[47] Maharishi Yoga Asanas help process and release stresses from the body and mind. Thus, the process of transcending could occur faster and the meditation session could be experienced as deeper, as was reported by the subjects in this study.
Conclusion
This research highlights the synergy and practice of Maharishi Yoga Asanas and TM practice. Optimally, practice of yoga should include experiences of the state of union of body, mind, and spirit, even if momentary, during asana practice as well as during the meditation that follows, leading to greater happiness during the day.[48] With regular yoga practice, these momentary experiences could become more frequent and for longer periods, leading to greater balance, wellbeing, and success in life. Further research could look at longterm effects of Maharishi Yoga Asana.

HONORIS CAUSA.
During a recent discussion in the House of Commons, an Honorable Member stated that he had frequently noticed very ordinary men returning, after a few years' absence in India, with a
handle to their names, and that he was at a loss to understand what
extraordinary evidence of ability or merit had resulted in the transfiguration of the chrysalis " Mr." into the butterfly " Sir!" ?a little interlude in the Honorable Member's speech, the somewhat questionable wit of which could not certainly be directed against the medical services. For, in comparison with the honors, distinctions, and benefits not illiberally distributed among other departments, the medical service has hitherto been least favored. On scanning the Bengal Army List, we find out

Januakt 1, 1875.]

of a total of upwards of three hundred and fifty medical officers, only two C.S.I.'s, three C.B.'s, and two in the receipt of good service pensions; while only one distinction of any kind whatever falls to the lot of the hundred and fifty gentlemen on the lists of the Bombay Medical Service! On the other hand, in the first three hundred and fifty names on the Bengal Staff Corps (excluding those in receipt of Colon-el's allowances) there are two K.C.B.'s, nearly thirty C.B.'s, about twelve C.S.I.'s, four K.C.S.I.'s, and three A.D.C.'s to the Queen. On taking all grades and departments mentioned in the Army List, there are thirteen Military Knights of the Bath, not one of whom is a
medical officer; there are sixty-one Military Companions, of whom three only are medical men; and there are eight Civil Companions, without any medical man. In the order of the Star of India, there are six Knight Commanders, no medical
officer being elevated to that grade; and there are eighteen
Companions, numbering three surgeons among the -list. Lastly* there are twenty-five good service pensions, of which two are received by medical officers. Of the Bengal Civil Service three hundred and forty-nine members possess three K.C.S.I.'s, four
C.S.I.'s, and seven C.B.'s. In addition, we not unfrequently hear of officials being in some manner or other distinguished after they leave the service; but among medical men there is
scarcely a solitary instance. Far be it from us to follow the example of the Honorable
Member, and to assert, or even insinuate, that the distinctions conferred have not been well earned and fairly deserved. Almost, without exception, we honestly believe such to have been
the case. But this cannot blind us to the fact that there are
men equally deserving among members of the Indian Medical Service, who have not received the honorary rewards to which, in all comparative justice, they are entitled. Neither does the knowledge that there are persons in the other services, who have been similarly passed over, render our own case any the
less irritating. In this particular instance at least, the sores of our friends bring no comforting salve for our own galls. Neither, on the other hand, do we regard our own disease, or our own sorrows, as the worst and most remarkable ever endured
by humanity. If we saw honors confined to those ruling over vast interests, and large questions, as the fortunes of states and the fate of dynasties, we might not consider our class hardly treated. But when we see honors descend from those
directing the great game, as played by kings and kaisers, to the small traffic of a local magnate wrangling over a road, or disputing over a feudatory zemindar, we cannot but esteem many of ourselves as equally worthy. "We are prepared, as a service,
to stand upon our own merits, and it is preposterous to suppose
that only those few medical officers, who have been singled out for decoration, are the only ones deserving, or that but one of the hundred and fifty medical men of the Bombay Service is worthy. It would be invidious to mention names among those now in this country. But, as a case in point, we may refer to a late Head of the Bengal Medical Department, a man who had served the Government faithfully for some forty years, acknowledged on all sides as a most skilful surgeon, who spent the morning and noon-tide of life in the investigation of disease, and who was permitted to depart to one of those bournes from which at least medical men never return (viz., Kensington or Bath) destitute of any personal mark of distinction whatever. These remarks are not penned in any carping spirit; neither are we

disposed to attach more importance to titular honors and distinctions than the occasion demands; for we have chosen the path of science, and that path, if sedulously and honorably pursued, brings to many its own peculiar reward, in the content which springs from doing good. But belonging, as we do, to a
public service, we cannot but feel that the claims of that service
are not considered, as we submit there is reason to expect they should be considered, when the distribution of worldly distinctions takes place. Being human, we must agree with Shakespeare, who long since observed that " it is pleasant to be made much of." It is a theory which every one knows to be false in fact, that virtue in real life is always productive of content. We therefore, however personally indifferent to the arbitrary rules guiding the distribution of honorary distinctions, cannot view the setting aside of the just claims of the service with the
stoical equanimity of a Diogenes. We are aware that it does
not much matter how the Apollo or the gladiator may be dressed; for the Apollo or the gladiator are still present. But the distinction between savage and civilized humanity lies not so much in qualities as in habits. Claiming to belong to civilized humanity, we cannot be altogether indifferent to the habits of our class, and to those things which, although of the world? worldly?the world nevertheless delighteth in. Paraphrasing a remark of Sir Astley Cooper's, we have no objection to remain untitled, if we can be useful. But it is the habit of the world
to confer some distinction on those supposed to be the most useful, and unless we have some earnest, in the extension of
the habit to our class, we can scarcely be satisfied in our own minds that we are useful. "We require some exhibition of the
proof positive.
We are, we confess, at a loss for the reason why the medical
service does not come in for a fair share of honors. As before
observed, it cannot possibly be that there are so few deserving amongst us. Neither can we suppose that it arises from medical
men declining to bow and kowtoio sufficiently to the powers that be ; tiiat they neglect to follow the eastern maxim, and when
the king saith at noon "it is night!" answer "behold the moon and stars!" for such a supposition would be altogether the reverse of complimentary to those presumed to recognize and distinguish merit. The reason must, therefore, be simply want
of forethought and consideration, to secure which the matter
only requires bringing forward. There appears to be?although we are loath to think there
is?a desire in some quarters to prevent medical men, whether belonging to the public services or otherwise, obtaining a fair
share of the flow from the fountain of honor. Not even self
sacrifice in the face of destroying disease, fully a3 noble as the feeling impelling Curtius to drive his war steed headlong into the gulf, or impelling Leonidas to sup with Pluto, so that he turned the Persian myriads from Thermopylae; not even conduct gallant as ancient or modern times can show ; not even the highest literary skill, or social qualities, has yet sufficed to create a medical peer. Yet as Dickens observed, "supposing we had this day a Baron Jenuer, or a Viscount Watt, or an Earl Stephenson, I wonder whether it would be cruelly disgraceful to our old nobility." When we see so many demonstrations of the truth of the assertion that " the robbery" (or in these days we might say successful commerce) of one age is the chivalry of the next, "we can scarcely think that a Lord Cooper or an Earl Christison would be misplaced." There are those, however,

We welcome the fourth edition of Dr. Leyton's small handbook on the treatment of diabetes mellitus, as it is a very simple exposition of our present knowledge cf the disease. The whole subject has been nicely condensed within 92 pages, two-thirds of which deal with the treatment of the disease.
Dr. Leyton starves his patients for about two days (during which period weak tea, soda water, and plain water in unlimited quantity are allowed), till sugar disappears from the urine and the blood-sugar falls below 0.14 per cent. Thereafter a progressive diet, for which Dr. Leyton has given various tables, is given. If by the two days' fasting the urine does not become sugarfree, the patient is investigated as to his renal threshold, and if the blood-sugar persists above 0.15 per cent, after a four days' fast, insulin is given.
Dr. Leyton has considered the details of the treatment under three heads: (1)' by diet alone, (2) by diet with insulin, and (3) by other preparations, with or without restrictions in diet.
We are sure that the book will be appreciated by the general practitioner, for whom it is especially intended.

PLASMOCHIN AS A MALARIAL GAMETOCIDE
By S. N. SUR, m.b., d.p.h., d.t.m. Assistant Director oj Public Health, Malaria Research
Bengal
H. P. SARKAR, l.m.s., d.p.h. Assistant Malariologist, Bengal Public Health
Department and
K. M. BANERJI, Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Public Health Department
Bengal
It is needless to describe the chemical nature
of the drug here and the literature on the subject of the treatment of malaria by the use of plasmochin is now too extensive to refer to in detail. The observations made by others
may be summarised as follows :?
(1) It has a destructive action on the tropho-
zoites of P. vivax and P. malarice.
(2) It has no such action on the trophozoites of P. falciparum.
(3) With daily doses of 0.06 gramme toxic symptoms may appear, but a dose of 0.04 gramme per day with 20 grains of quinine is
the least toxic but most effective treatment.
In doses of 0.01 gramme per day for 6 days it
can clear out all crescents.

(4) It has a preventive action in the prospective host.
(5) It has a destructive action on the gametocytes of all the three species of malaria para-
sites.
(6) It can prevent the development of gametocytes in man.
(7) It can so affect the gametocytes that, although not apparently destroyed, they are incapable of development into oocysts or sporozoites in the efficient mosquito hosts.
On the last-mentioned point (7) several
workers have made observations in America
and in the Federated Malay States, and the writers of the present article have specially observed the action of small doses of plasmochin on the gametocytes to find out if it can prevent the developmental cycle in the mosquitoes of Bengal. This they consider as very important from the malaria prevention point
of view.
Hence in order to find out how much reliance
can be put on plasmochin to devitalize or sterilize the malaria gametocytes in man and thus prevent infection in mosquito, experiments were made by the authors by feeding mosquitoes on malaria cases with gametocytes in the peripheral blood. The following six species, namely, A. stephensi, A. varuna, A. juliginosus, A. ludlowii, A. maculatus and A. maculatus var. ivillmori were used during the experiments.
The mosquitoes experimented with were all bred out in the Malaria Research Laboratory of the Bengal Public Health Department. The specimens of maculatus and willmori were
hatched out from larvae collected from Kalim-
pong and Sikkim. The imagines after being hatched out were kept in cages provided with water and raisins for a period of 3 to 4 days. It was found necessary to keep the newlyhatched mosquitoes in cages for at least 48 to 72 hours before feeding them on patients because they generally refused to take blood before this period. For feeding on patients they were taken out in glass jars to the malaria
outdoor treatment centre.
The malaria patients who were selected for feeding purposes were picked out from the cases coming to the outdoor treatment centres at Bandel and Singur in the Hooghly district.
Patients come to these centres twice a week.
On the first day of attendance the blood of the selected patient was taken in thin films for examination and he was given a placebo of coloured water only. As a rule 100 microscopic fields were examined in each slide. Only those cases which showed 8 to 12 gametocytes per 100 fields were chosen for the feeding experi-
ments.
When the selected patient attends for the second time, i.e., on the 4th day, the mosquitoes were brought in wide-mouthed glass jars and were put on the pit of the stomach of the patient for about 20 minutes. This batch

of mosquitoes were labelled as ' fed before the administration of plasmochin'. Another blood film was taken on this day for examination and counting of the parasites. After this feed the patient was given plasmoquin only for 3 days with a dosage of 0.02 gramme per day per adult. A daily dose of 0.01 gramme was usually given to a child of
12 years and under.
On the 8th day, i.e., when the patient attended for the third time, the blood of the patient was again examined and a batch of mosquitoes were fed which were labelled as 1 after plas-
mochin \ After the feed the above two batches
of mosquitoes?one that fed on the 4th day before the administration of plasmochin and the second that fed on the 8th day, i.e., after the administration of plasmochin?were transferred to separate cages provided with water and raisins. They were kept at the ordinary

development of parasites within the mosquitoes. On the 8th day, that is, after 3 days' administration of plasmochin he was given treatment with quinine and arsenic as usual, with or without plasmochin.
The table below shows the results with
P. falciparum. In this group of malignant tertian patients, 9 out of 17 cases became free of parasites in all stages after the administration of plasmochin only. The remaining 8 showed rings and crescents although reduced in number. On the patients of this group A. fuliginosus, varuna, stephensi, ludlowii,
maculatus and willmori were fed before the
administration of plasmochin. Those which
survived were dissected with the results stated
below. Similarly a batch of mosquitoes of species A. fuliginosus, varuna, stephensi, ludlowii, maculatus and willmori were fed after the administration of plasmochin.

after which those which survived were dissected
and the results noted.
The whole of these observations were made
during the period from March 1931 to February 1932. The writers were handicapped in the matter of selection of patients by the fact that they were all outdoor patients attending only twice a week and most of them failing to come regularly. There was absolutely no control over these patients.
Observations were made on all three types of parasites. Only thin films were used for the examination of the blood, which was done once on the first day, then on the fourth day, and again on the eighth day.
A placebo of coloured water was invariably given to such patients for the first three days to prevent any possible action on the parasites. Simple drugs such as diaphoretic mixtures have
been noticed to influence the number of para-
sites. On the 4th day when the patient comes again to the centre, he is given only 3 doses of plasmochin to be taken in 3 days. The dose was determined according to the age
calculated on the basis of 0.02 gramme per
adult per day. This was to find out if this. small dose is effective in checking the

None of the mosquitoes fed after the administration of plasmochin were infected with* P. falciparuin, whereas all the species which were fed before plasmochin got the infection in varying percentages.
Similar observations were made in 17 cases
of P. vivax infection. Without any exception the patients in this group, unlike those in the malignant tertian group, became free from parasites after 3 days' administration of small doses of plasmochin only. Anophelines of species A. fuliginosus, varuna, stephensi, and ludlowii were fed on these patients both before and after the administration of plasmochin
and the results of the dissections were noted as
shown below (first table on p. 492). The mosquitoes which were fed after plas-
mochin did not take the infection, whereas all the species except ludlowii developed benign tertian malaria parasites when fed before the administration of plasmochin. The number of ludlowii experimented with was very small in
this group. In 7 out of the 9 P. malaria cases both tro-
phozoites and gametocytes disappeared after the administration of plasmochin for 3 days. In 2 cases trophozoites only persisted for 3 days though they disappeared subsequently on

/ A. varuna is a very feeble potential carrier in
comparison with the other species of mosquitoes. The percentage of infection in the total of all mosquitoes fed before plasmochin was 16 against nil amongst those fed after the administration of plasmochin. It is seen therefore that even a small dose of 0.02 gramme per day per adult for three days even without quinine will render the parasites incapable of further development in the insect host.
A. varuna were successful in taking infection
when the crescent count was above 20 per 100
fields, except in case No. 3101 which showed
101 crescents. But no conclusion can be drawn
as the number of observations in this particular
case was very small.
Conclusions
(1) Plasmochin even in small doses of 0.02 gramme per day per adult for 3 days without the aid of quinine can reduce the number , of malaria parasites in all stages to such an extent that they are not detectable in 77 per cent, of cases in 100 microscopic fields of an ordinary
thin film.

Safety of Once-Daily Single-Inhaler Triple Therapy

with Fluticasone Furoate/Umeclidinium/Vilanterol

in Japanese Patients with Asthma: A Long-Term

(52-Week) Phase III Open-Label Study

Purpose: The pivotal CAPTAIN study reported a favorable safety profile with once-daily inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting muscarinic antagonist/long-acting 2-agonist (ICS/LAMA/LABA) tri­ ple combination of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI) in patients with inadequately controlled asthma, some of whom were Japanese. Here, we evaluate the long-term (52 weeks) safety of FF/UMEC/VI in Japanese patients with asthma. Patients and Methods: This was a Phase III, 52-week, multicenter, non-comparator, non-randomized, open-label study (NCT03184987) in Japanese adults receiving maintenance therapy with ICS/LABA, with or without LAMA. At enrollment, patients were allocated to either FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25mcg (Group 1) or 200/62.5/25mcg (Group 2). Patients in Group 1 could have their treatment stepped up to 200/62.5/25mcg at Week 24 if their Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-7 score was >0.75. The primary endpoint was the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs). Secondary endpoints included vital signs, electrocardiogram measurements, and clinical laboratory tests (biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis). Efficacy was assessed as "other" endpoints. Results: A total of 111 Japanese patients were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Overall, 77 (69%) patients reported 1 AE (Group 1: n=30 [64%]; step-up group: n=7 [78%]; Group 2: n=40 [73%]). SAEs were reported for 1 (2.1%) and 2 (3.6%) patients in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. All SAEs were considered unrelated to study treatment. One AE and one SAE led to study withdrawal: oropharyngeal discomfort (Group 1); eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Group 2). No new safety concerns were identified throughout the 52-week treatment period. Conclusion: In this uncontrolled open-label study, no new safety concerns were observed with long-term (52 weeks) treatment with once-daily FF/UMEC/VI among 111 Japanese patients with asthma.

Introduction
It is estimated that up to 18% of the global population and 6-10% of the Japanese population are affected by asthma,1,2 a chronic respiratory airway disease character­ ized by symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough.1
Around 30-50% of patients with moderate/severe asthma who are prescribed and are
adherent to inhaled corticosteroids/long-acting 2-agonist (ICS/LABA) therapy remain symptomatic.3-6 A recent real-world study of patients with asthma in Japan

showed that 50% of the overall population had partially controlled asthma with 15% having uncontrolled asthma.7 Furthermore, a greater proportion of patients with uncon­ trolled severe asthma in Japan require oral corticosteroids (OCS), have higher rates of hospitalization and a greater medical and economic burden compared with patients with controlled severe asthma or mild-to-moderate asthma, indi­ cating a clear need for more effective management.8
For patients with uncontrolled asthma despite ICS/LABA therapy, treatment options include increasing ICS dose and/or adding another bronchodilator, such as a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA).1 The addi­ tion of the LAMA tiotropium is recommended by both the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and the Japanese Society of Allergology for patients with uncontrolled asthma on ICS/LABA therapy,1,2 and has been shown to improve lung function, symptom control, and the rate of asthma exacerbations.9,10 Previous studies have demon­ strated favorable safety for ICS, LABA, or LAMA in patients with asthma. An integrated analysis demonstrated that fluticasone furoate (FF), a once-daily ICS, has a favorable safety profile, with the most frequent drugrelated adverse events (AEs) being headache, dysphonia, and oral/oropharyngeal candidiasis.11 Similarly, treatment with vilanterol (VI), a LABA, has been reported to be associated with low incidences of AEs, the most common reported being tremor and palpitations.12 Glucose effects (eg, impaired glucose tolerance; raised blood glucose) had a reported incidence of 0-1% among patients treated with VI in one study.12 Safety results of dual combination therapy with FF/VI have also shown a favorable risk profile, with headache, nervous system disorders, and nasopharyngitis reported as the most frequently occurring on-treatment AEs.4,13 Treatment with umeclidinium (UMEC), a LAMA, was also not associated with significant safety concerns; the most frequently reported on-treatment AEs included headache, nasopharyngitis, abnormal product taste, and pharyngitis.14,15
Single-inhaler triple therapy with the combination of FF/UMEC/VI is widely approved as a once-daily treat­ ment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).16 Single-inhaler FF/UMEC/VI triple therapy has also recently been approved in the United States and Japan as a once-daily maintenance treatment for adult patients with asthma, based on positive findings from the recently pub­ lished Phase IIIA Clinical Study in Asthma Patients Receiving Triple Therapy in a Single Inhaler (CAPTAIN) study.17 CAPTAIN compared the efficacy and safety of

once-daily FF/UMEC/VI with FF/VI over 24-52 weeks in patients with asthma inadequately controlled on ICS/LABA. Results showed improved lung function, reduced symptoms and improved asthma control, and numerical reductions in the annualized rate of moderate/ severe exacerbations with FF/UMEC/VI versus FF/VI. The safety profile of both treatments was similar, with no new or unexpected safety findings. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population of CAPTAIN included 229 (9.4%) patients across 63 centers in Japan, all of whom were of Japanese ancestry, for whom efficacy and safety outcomes were consistent with the overall study population.18
The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term (52 weeks) safety of fixed-dose FF/UMEC/VI in Japanese patients with asthma. Treatment efficacy was also assessed as an "other" endpoint in an exploratory manner. This study was used as part of the submission of a regulatory application to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for once-daily FF/UMEC/VI for the treatment of adults with asthma.

This was a Phase III, 52-week, multicenter, non-comparator, non-randomized, open-label study in Japanese patients aged 18 years or older, who had received an asthma diagnosis at least a year prior to providing informed consent and were receiving maintenance therapy with ICS/LABA, with or without LAMA, for at least 4 weeks pre-screening (GSK 207236, NCT03184987). Patients were excluded if an asthma exacerbation occurred that required a change in maintenance therapy in the 6 weeks prior to screening, although patients who required a temporary change in asthma therapy (eg, increased dose of ICS or use of OCS) were not necessarily excluded provided the patient's condi­ tion had stabilized upon resuming pre-exacerbation main­ tenance therapy. Additionally, patients were excluded if they had a diagnosis of other concurrent respiratory disor­ ders, including a diagnosis of COPD.19 Current smokers (within 12 months of screening) or former smokers with a smoking history of 10 pack-years were also excluded. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Supplementary Materials.
The study design is shown in Figure 1. Briefly, eligible patients entered into a 2-week run-in period, during which they continued to receive their pre-screening asthma main­ tenance therapy. At enrollment, patients were allocated to

Patients receiving FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25mcg could have their treatment stepped up to 200/62.5/25mcg at Week 24 if their ACQ-7 score was >0.75; however, this step-up was at the investigator's discretion. All treatments were adminis­ tered via the ELLIPTA dry-powder inhaler (Glaxo Operations UK, Hertfordshire, UK) once daily in the morning.

This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice, and applicable country-specific regulatory requirements. The protocol was reviewed and approved by an internal GSK review board and was approved by applicable central or local institutional review boards or independent ethics commit­ tees. All patients enrolled provided written informed con­ sent and patient anonymity was preserved using methods approved by the Ethics Committee.
Safety Endpoints and Assessments
The primary endpoint was the incidence and type of AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) in all dose groups, including the step-up group, and the total study population. AEs of special interest (AESIs) were defined as AEs that were associated with known pharmacological effects of ICS, LAMA, and LABA. For secondary endpoints, raw value and change from baseline were summarized by dose group and in the total population for each visit, and included vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate) measured at every clin­ ical visit; electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements (QTcF, heart rate, PR interval) at screening and Weeks 4, 24, and 52, or the Early Withdrawal Visit (if applicable); clinical laboratory tests (biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis) at screening and Weeks 12, 24, and 52, or the Early Withdrawal Visit (if applicable).
For clinical laboratory tests, data were summarized by shifts from baseline relative to the normal range by dose group and in the total study population at each visit.

"Other" Endpoints
The efficacy of FF/UMEC/VI combination therapy was pre-defined as "other" endpoints and assessed in an exploratory manner. Summary statistics were provided for change from baseline at Weeks 24 and 52 for the following outcomes, and are reported in the total study population combining all three treatment groups only: trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1); ACQ-7 total score; St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score; Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) total score; and annualized rate of moderate/severe and severe asthma exacerbations.
Statistical Analyses
Summaries of safety data, patient demographics, and other (efficacy) data were conducted on the ITT population according to the treatment they received. All AEs were classified using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 22.0 and grouped by system organ class and preferred term, unless otherwise stated. As the study was an open-label safety study, and efficacy assessments were specified as "other" endpoints, no statis­ tical analyses were planned, and thus only summary tables

for efficacy parameters are provided. Programming of summaries and figures was performed using SAS System version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results Patient Demographics and Clinical Characteristics
The study was conducted in 14 centers across Japan from June 22, 2017 (first patient enrolled) to June 25, 2019 (last patient last visit). A total of 111 patients were included in the ITT population: Group 1, n=47; step-up group, n=9; Group 2, n=55. Of these, 46, 8, and 51 patients in the respective dose groups completed 52 weeks of treatment. Six patients withdrew from the study (Group 1: n=1, AE; step-up group: n=1, withdrawal by patient; Group 2: n=4, withdrawal by patient, n=2, AE, n=1, physician decision) (Figure 2).
Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 2. Overall, patients had a mean (stan­ dard deviation [SD]) age of 50.9 (13.41) years, with slightly more females (n=64 [58%]). Patients had a predicted FEV1 mean (SD) of 86.4% (16.58) and asthma duration of 18.5 years (14.37).

Safety
Overall, 77 (69.4%) patients reported at least one AE (Group 1: 30 [63.8%]; step-up group: 7 [77.8%]; Group 2: 40 [72.7%] Table 3). The most frequent AEs reported were nasopharyngitis (n=33 [29.7%]), dysgeusia (n=11 [9.9%]), and pharyngitis (n=11 [9.9%]) (Table 3). The severities of almost all AEs were classified as mild or moderate, with only 4 (3.6%) events reported as severe across a diverse range of AEs. Two events led to withdrawal from the study: orophar­ yngeal discomfort (Group 1) (Table 3) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Group 2) (Table 4). The AE of oropharyngeal discomfort was considered related to study treatment, but was mild in severity and non-serious. No fatal AEs were reported.
SAEs were reported for 1 patient in Group 1 (appendici­ tis) and 2 patients in Group 2 (spontaneous pneumothorax, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis) (Table 4). None of the SAEs reported were considered by the study

investigators to be related to study treatment. The patient reporting eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis with­ drew from the study (see above); however, the SAE did not resolve. The other 2 SAEs did not lead to treatment disconti­ nuation, and both events resolved.
The frequency of AESIs was low overall (Table 5). Dry mouth/drying of the airway secretions (broad focus) was the most frequently reported AESI (n=53 [47.7%]), due to the number of patients reporting nasopharyngitis (n=33 [29.7%]) (Table 5). No participants reported an AESI of dry mouth/drying of the airway secretions (narrow focus [defined using seven pre-specified preferred terms, exclud­ ing nasopharyngitis]). No major adverse cardiac events occurred and very few participants (n=5 [4.5%]) experi­ enced AESIs of cardiovascular effects. Only one pneumo­ nia event (non-serious) was reported. The proportion of patients with hypersensitivity in the total study population was 16.2% (n=18). However, individual preferred terms

within the overall category of hypersensitivity did not exceed 1 or 2 events, with the exception for eczema and allergic rhinitis, which were reported in 7 (6.3) and 5 (4.5) patients, respectively, in the total study population. None of these events were reported by the study investigators to be related to study treatment.
No new safety concerns were identified from additional safety evaluations throughout the 52-week treatment per­ iod in any of the dose groups. Mean changes from baseline in vital signs were minimal across the total study

population (systolic blood pressure: +2.0 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure +2.3 mmHg; pulse rate +0.6 beats/min). There were no clinically significant abnormal findings on the ECG. Few patients had a shift from baseline to high or low value relative to the normal range for each parameter of hematology and clinical chemistry assessed (Supplementary Table 1). The most frequently reported abnormal clinical chemistry parameter was glucose, with a shift from baseline to high in 25% of patients in the total study population (Supplementary Table 1).

"Other" Endpoints
Exploratory efficacy data revealed mean (SD) changes from baseline across the total study population in trough FEV1 (Week 24: 166mL [303]; Week 52: 165mL [294]); ACQ-7 total score (Week 24: -0.51 [0.72]; Week 52: -0.63 [0.68]; minimum clinically important difference [MCID]: -0.5); SGRQ total score (Week 24: -8.27 [11.74]; Week 52: -10.07 [11.73]; MCID: -4.0); AQLQ total score at (Week 24: 0.42 [0.69]; Week 52: 0.55 [0.67]; MCID: 0.5) (Supplementary Table 2). Overall, few patients experienced moderate/severe or severe asthma exacerbations (n=19 [17%] and n=14 [13%], respectively), and corresponding annualized rates were also low (0.41 and 0.30, respectively).
Discussion
This Phase III trial was the first study to evaluate the use of UMEC exclusively in a Japanese asthma population receiving maintenance therapy with ICS/LABA, with or

without LAMA. The recently published pivotal Phase IIIA CAPTAIN study17 compared the efficacy and safety of once-daily FF/UMEC/VI with FF/VI in patients with asthma inadequately controlled on ICS/LABA, with approximately 10% of the patient population being of Japanese origin.18 However, compared with Japanese patients in the CAPTAIN study,18 the patients in our study had better disease control, as shown by lower prestudy ACQ-6 mean (SD) scores (1.36 [0.54] vs 1.61 [0.68]) and better lung function, as shown by higher mean (SD) percent predicted pre-bronchodilator FEV1, mean (SD) (86.4 [16.6] vs 73.4 [14.3]). These findings may be related to differences in eligibility criteria between the two studies.
No new safety concerns were observed with long-term (52 weeks) treatment with once-daily FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25mcg or 200/62.5/25mcg, nor among the small group of patients who stepped up treatment at Week 24. Almost all AEs were reported as mild or moderate in their

maximum severity, and only 3 SAEs were reported, all of which were not drug related according to the study inves­ tigators. No clinically significant findings or abnormalities in clinical laboratory, vital signs, or ECG assessments were observed. AEs leading to treatment discontinuation and SAEs were rare across all groups. The incidence of nasopharyngitis, the most common AE, was also similar across groups. It is important to note that this study was not powered to detect differences in AE rates between treatment groups. Furthermore, the lack of a control group means that it is not possible to conclude as to whether AE rates were higher in patients in this study, who were all treated with FF/UMEC/VI, compared with those on other treatments. The incidence and type of ontreatment AEs or treatment-related AEs were similar to observations from previous studies with FF, VI, UMEC, or their combination treatments in patients with asthma or COPD.
The frequency of dysgeusia (and drug-related events of dysgeusia) reported in this study (n=11 [9.9%]) was higher than reported in CAPTAIN (n=3 [0.1%]).17 Importantly, all cases of dysgeusia were mild and all events were recovered/resolved at the end of follow-up, with no treat­ ment discontinuation. It should be noted that the openlabel design of this study may have contributed to increased reporting of some AEs in patients receiving FF/UMEC/VI, and furthermore some events were reported at only a few study sites. Infective pneumonia was reported for 1 patient in this study (0.9%; N=111) and 36 patients (1.5%; N=2436) in the CAPTAIN study. These very low numbers of pneumonia events and the open-label design of this study mean it is difficult to draw compar­ isons with the CAPTAIN study.
There were no clinically significant changes from base­ line in any parameters of clinical laboratory evaluations in this study. As seen in CAPTAIN,17 the most frequently reported clinical chemistry parameter with a shift from baseline to outside the normal range post baseline (worst case post baseline) was glucose in the total study popula­ tion. However, this may be explained by blood sampling under non-fasting conditions, as permitted in the study. No AEs relevant to glucose increase were reported.
The safety profile of FF/UMEC/VI in Japanese patients with asthma in this study appears to be in line with pre­ vious clinical studies of FF/UMEC/VI, VI-containing dual therapies (FF/VI or UMEC/VI), or UMEC monotherapy in Japanese patients with COPD.20,21 Furthermore, the safety profile of FF/UMEC/VI in this study was similar to the

safety profile reported for the overall CAPTAIN study population17 and the Japanese cohort.18
This study was neither powered nor designed to assess efficacy endpoints including pulmonary function. However, exploratory assessments revealed improvements in lung function and patient reported outcomes over 52 weeks versus baseline. A MCID for FEV1 has not been formally defined in asthma; however, a previous Phase III study of patients with persistent asthma showed that compared with placebo, FF 100mcg and FF/VI 100/25mcg improved trough FEV1 by 136mL and 172mL, respectively.22 In addition, changes in patient-reported outcome measures exceeded the respective MCIDs at Week 52. Whilst we were unable to compare against a control in our study, these data support efficacy observations seen in the Japanese cohort of the CAPTAIN study.18 Few patients experienced moderate or moderate/ severe exacerbations and mean annualized rate of moder­ ate/severe exacerbations were low, in line with observations in the Japanese subpopulation of CAPTAIN.18
The strengths of the study include its long duration, which allows assessment of the safety of FF/UMEC/VI over a 52-week period. Whilst the study focuses on the Japanese population, the eligibility criteria were as permis­ sive as possible to more broadly reflect the asthma popula­ tion seen in real-world clinical practice compared with randomized controlled trials that have more stringent elig­ ibility criteria. Limitations include its open-label and nonrandomized design with no control group and the rela­ tively small population size (N=111), and thus the study was not designed to assess efficacy.
Conclusion
In conclusion, no new safety concerns were associated with long-term (52 weeks) treatment with once-daily FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25mcg or 200/62.5/25mcg, nor among patients stepping up treatment in Japanese patients with asthma. These findings support the positive risk/ben­ efit profile of FF/UMEC/VI in Japanese patients as observed in the pivotal CAPTAIN study.17

ABSTRACT: This study assessed selected measures of cognitive function in trained cyclists who observed daylight fasting during Ramadan. Eleven cyclists volunteered to participate (age: 21.6±4.8 years, VO2max: 57.7±5.6 ml·kg-1·min-1) and were followed for 2 months. Cognitive function (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), Reaction Time index (RTI) and Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP) tests) and sleep architecture (ambulatory EEG) were assessed: before Ramadan (BR), in the 1st week (RA1) and 4th week of Ramadan (RA4), and 2 weeks post-Ramadan (PR). Both cognitive tests were performed twice per day: before and after Ramadan at 8-10 a.m. and 4-6 p.m., and during Ramadan at 4-6 p.m. and 0-2 a.m., respectively. Training load (TL) by the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) method and wellness (Hooper index) were measured daily. If the TL increased over the study period, this variable was stable during Ramadan. The perceived fatigue and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) increased at RA4. Sleep patterns and architecture showed clear disturbances, with significant increases in the number of awakenings and light sleep durations during Ramadan (RA1 and RA4), together with decreased durations of deep and REM sleep stages at PR. RTI (simple and multiple reaction index) reaction and movement times did not vary over the study period. The RVP test showed reduced false alarms during Ramadan, suggesting reduced impulsivity. Overall accuracy significantly increased at RA1, RA4 and PR compared to baseline. At RA4, the accuracy was higher at 0-2 a.m. compared to 4-6 p.m. Despite the observed disturbances in sleep architecture, Ramadan fasting did not negatively impact the cognitive performance of trained cyclists from the Middle East.

Key words: riders fasters intermittent fasting

INTRODUCTION Muslim athletes experience specific challenges during the month of Ramadan. During this 29-30-day period, they are required to train or even compete while they do not eat or drink from dawn to sunset. Given the constraints that Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) can induce on Muslim athletes, researchers have mainly investigated the link between RIF and physical performance in athletes [1, 2]. Interestingly, researchers found that when athletes' sleep schedule was controlled, the effects of RIF on physical performance were negligible [1, 3]. This suggests that cognitive function could moderate the relationship between RIF and physical performance.
The literature indicates that limited attention has been given to the impact of RIF on cognitive performance in athletes [4]. Recently, Tian et al. [4] examined the effect RIF on cognitive function according to time of day in healthy Muslim athletes. They found that (a) in the morning (09:00 h), detection and identification perfor-

mances were better during fasting than after Ramadan, while (b) in the afternoon (16:00 h), verbal learning and short-term memory performances were better after Ramadan than during fasting. These findings indicate that the effects of RIF on cognitive function were heterogeneous and domain-specific with respect to the time of day.
Ramadan adaptations depend on geographical location and/or culture [5, 6]. While some Muslims keep relatively active during the day, others simply invert day/night patterns, keeping active at night by shifting their main sleep to the daylight time. In the Middle East, for instance, hot climate likely contributed to the more common night-to-day shift, with most athletes sleeping during the day, and living/training at night. Therefore, testing cognitive function in such a population has to be done taking into account the individuals' lifestyle. It would make no sense to wake up an athlete at 9 a.m. during Ramadan to test his cognitive function, knowing that he went to

bed and fell asleep only a few hours before. Therefore, for such a population cognitive function testing should be performed as follows: in the morning and afternoon before and after Ramadan [4], and shifted to afternoon and evening during Ramadan, in order to respect the fasters' circadian rhythm.
Moreover, as sleep schedule and quality could impact on cognitive function [5], a sleep-related measure could help interpret the results of cognitive function measures during Ramadan. Sleep can be monitored through objective measures, such as ambulatory polysomnography via light belt devices. It can also be assessed every day through the Hooper index [7, 8], with quality of sleep reported by the study participants. The latter index, reporting the athletes' wellness, can also serve, along with the training load monitoring assessment [9], to check if there is any possibility of training impacting the athletes' general wellness/fatigue status, and thus cognitive function.
The present study tested how RIF influences cognitive function according to time of day in trained athletes from the Middle East fasting during Ramadan. Cognitive function was examined through simple and complex reaction movement time (RTI) and rapid visual information processing (RVP) because these measures have been related to sports requirements [4, 10-14]. Measures of training load, wellness and sleep were also assessed to neutralize any confounding factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants. Eleven healthy male trained cyclists (7 seniors and 4
juniors) volunteered to participate in this study. They were regularly training throughout the study period (see below). Their age, anthropometric, and VO2max data were as follows: 21.6±4.8 years (range: 16.3-30.5), 66.8±9.1 kg, 176.1±6.0 cm; 57.7±5.6 ml·kg-1·min-1 (all measured one week after Ramadan). For external validity of the results, only athletes with previous experience of Ramadan fasting were selected [15]. Participants began fasting at the age of 12.6±0.7 years and were experienced with fasting during Ramadan. The participants had cycling training experience of 9.6±3.6 years. All participants signed an informed consent form (with signed consent from the parents when appropriate) before participating in the study. The study protocol respected the Helsinki convention, and was approved by the Shafallah-IRB committee, Doha, Qatar.
Experimental procedures
The study was conducted during the summer of 2013. Ramadan occurred from the 9th of July to the 7th of August. The participants were living in a residential training camp for 3.5 months from July to mid-October, preparing for an international competition starting on the 20th of October. Participants spent the pre-Ramadan period and the first week of Ramadan training in the GCC (Middle East), and then relocated to Europe for the overseas summer training camp. When in the GCC, the minimum fasting duration was approximately 15 h 15 min (first day of Ramadan, dawn: 3:16 a.m. to sunset: 6:29 p.m.). In the Europe training camp location, this duration was extended to ~16 h 30 min (last day of Ramadan: dawn: 4:07 a.m. to
50

sunset: 8:36 p.m.). During Ramadan, there was a clear shift of bedtime for all the participants. Indeed, the cyclists shifted pre-Ramadan sleep from night-time to day-time sleep during Ramadan. Most of them stayed awake for the whole night and then took their Sohoor (last meal allowed before starting the fast), had their prayers and then went to bed to start sleeping in early morning.
The cyclists were in a slow-progressively increasing training load period, bringing them to the objective of their training process (the international race, starting on October the 20th, i.e. ~2.5 months after the end of Ramadan). Training was first composed of endurance training, and then intensity training was progressively included. The cyclists started to participate in competitions 2 weeks after the end of the study. Therefore, the measures were performed in a period of exclusive training with a slight progressive increase in training load. Training load and cyclists' wellness were measured daily and are reported for the 2 weeks before Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, and for 2 weeks post-Ramadan. Cognitive function and sleep measures were performed at 4 time points: the last week before Ramadan (BR), at the end of the first week of Ramadan (RA1), at the end of the 4th week of Ramadan (RA4), and at the end of the 2nd week post-Ramadan (PR).
Cognitive function assessment
Participants were familiarized with the cognitive function tests once, 10 to 12 days before Ramadan. During the testing period, each athlete was tested at 2 times of day at BR, RA1, RA4, and PR. The two times of day were chosen taking into account the sleep pattern of the participants and in order to respect an inter-test interval of about 8 hours. Before and after Ramadan the tests were performed at 8-10 a.m. and 4-6 p.m. During Ramadan, the testing times were shifted to 4-6 p.m. and 0-2 a.m., respectively. Thus, participants were tested in the beginning and middle of their awakening time. The only cognitive test that was performed in a fasted state was the first measurement during Ramadan (end of afternoon, 4-6 p.m.), as the fasting break (Iftar) always occurred after 6 p.m. During cognitive function assessment, the cyclists were tested in a quiet room with environmental conditions of 22-23.5°C and 50-60% humidity. The administered tests were part of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). This computerized neuropsychological assessment was developed at Cambridge University in the 1980s [16-18]. Two tests were extracted from the CANTAB battery to assess, Reaction Time (RTI), and Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP), to assess cognitive processes involved when practising sports [4, 10-14]. The tests were administered using a computer with a touch-sensitive screen. Application of the test and feedback were performed in a standardized manner [16].
Reaction Time (RTI) RTI is a latency task with a comparative history (the five-choice task) and uses a procedure to separate response latency from movement time.

Ramadan intermittent fasting and cognitive function in cyclists

Task: The test is divided into five stages, which require increasingly complex chains of responses. In each stage, the participant has to react as soon as possible to a yellow dot that appears on the screen. In the simple reaction time task the dot appears in the only circle appearing on the screen. For the multiple reaction time, the dot may appear in one of five locations present on the screen. To that, the participant must respond by (1) touching the screen, (2) using the press pad, and finally by (3) using both actions. Outcome measures: The four outcome measures in RTI are divided into reaction time (simple and five-choice) and movement time (simple and five-choice). Administration time: around 3 min.
Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP) RVP is a test of sustained attention, has proved to be useful in many studies, and is a sensitive measure of general focusing performance [12]. Task: A white box appears in the computer screen, inside which digits (from 2 to 9) appear in a pseudo-random order, at the rate of 100 digits per minute. Participants are requested to continuously focus on the screen to detect target sequences of digits and to register responses using the press pad. The digit sequences (2-4-6, 3-57, 4-6-8) are continuously displayed on the side of the screen in order to be seen and remembered by the assessed subject. Outcome measures: The RVP outcome measures cover latency, probabilities and sensitivity (calculated using signal detection theory), hits, misses, false alarms and rejections. Administration time: around seven minutes.
Both RTI and RVP were performed with a few seconds of rest in between. Therefore the battery testing time ranged from 10 to 11 min.
Training load and wellness assessment
The rating of perceived exertion (RPE) method was used to assess training load. The `subjective' feeling of the athlete translates all the physiological and psychological variables into one rating, which is multiplied by the training duration to provide a single value of training load. TL = RPE x training duration (min). Weekly training load (TL) was also calculated as the sum of the week' daily TLs.
The RPE training load monitoring tool was first validated by [19] in sport, and has been specifically used in cyclists by [20-22], among others.
In addition to the RPE tool, the `Hooper Questionnaire' was administered every morning to each cyclist to assess their Wellness score. This method presented by [7, 8] allows one to follow four variables: 1 - perceived sleep quality; 2 - perceived quantities of (a) stress, (b) delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and (c) general fatigue.
Sleep measures
Ambulatory EEG (ZEO Sleep System, Zeo Inc, Newton MA) was used to estimate sleep duration, sleep macro-architecture, namely the

specific sleep stages (light, deep, rapid eye movement (REM)), and periods of sleep interruption (i.e. awakenings). These were assessed during the primary sleep (nights before and after Ramadan, and day-time sleep during Ramadan) at BR, RA1, RA4, and PR. Cyclists were required to wear a light-weight headband which contains a single-channel, soft sensor to detect EEG activity. The device is easy to use, and provides rapid but validated results [23]. Participants always slept in quiet and dark bedrooms with air conditioning temperature set between 20 and 22°C. As the ambulatory devices were placed only during primary sleep, this study did not take into account the naps of the participants.
Statistics
All data were analysed with SPSS version 21.0, and expressed as mean±SD. A one-way within-subject analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures was used to assess the main effects of time (time points: BR, RA1, RA2, and PR) on changes in TL, Hooper index, and sleep parameters. A two-way ANOVA for repeated measures was performed to determine the effects of time and time-of-day on the cognitive function (RTI and RVP). Whenever a significant main effect or interaction effect was observed, post-hoc pairwise comparisons were performed using Sidák correction. The level of statistical significance was set at p<0.05.
RESULTS
Cognitive function
RTI Reaction and movement times (simple and complex) and mean latency time were not significantly affected either by RIF or by time of day.
RVP The false alarms log count was significantly reduced at RA1 (0.7±0.4, p=0.007), and RA4 (0.3±0.3; p=0.001) compared with baseline (n=1.1±0.5). Overall accuracy was significantly increased at: RA1

that of RA1. Within the Hooper index score, the perceived DOMS was significantly higher at RA4 compared to RA3 and RA1. Likewise, perceived fatigue was significantly higher at RA4 and 2 weeks-PR compared to RA3.

Training load
Figure 2 shows the average weekly training load over the 2-month study. There was no significant change of TL throughout Ramadan. Nevertheless, there was a significant increase in TL over the 2-month study period, with TL of 2 weeks BR and that of 2 weeks PR being significantly different than the rest of the measures. The Hooper index (sum of 4 scores) did not differ during Ramadan compared to BR. Nevertheless, the Hooper index at RA4 was significantly higher than

Sleep measures
With respect to baseline (one week before Ramadan - BR), the total sleep duration of the main/primary sleep did not change significantly over the study period (see Figure 3). Bed time shifted from 2:50 a.m. before Ramadan to 5:04 a.m. at RA1, 6:14 a.m. at RA2, then strongly shifted back to 00:21 a.m. after Ramadan. At RA1, 25% of the participants had very long sleep durations (more than 9 hours) [24]. This was inverted during the last week of Ramadan, with 25% of the participants having very short sleep durations (shorter than 6 hours) [24]. Although mean sleep duration decreased from around 7 h at baseline and at RA4 to less than 6 h at 2 weeks post-Ramadan, the high heterogeneity of the data resulted in no significant difference between values. The number of awakenings during sleep tended to increase during the first (4.3±2.6, p=0.013) and last week of Ramadan (3.9±3.6, p=0.033) compared to pre-Ramadan (1.9±1.7), and 2 weeks post-Ramadan (2.4±1.7) values, being similar to baseline. Sleep architecture was also impacted during the study (Figure 4). Light sleep duration significantly increased at RA1 and RA4 and then turned back to baseline values at post-Ramadan, while deep and REM sleep stages duration progressively decreased during the study to reach significantly lower values than baseline at 2 weeks PR.

plex reaction and movement times did not vary over the study period, whereas false alarms decreased on the sustained attention task during Ramadan. Overall rapid visual information processing accuracy was higher at 0 2 h a.m. compared to 4-6 p.m. at the end of Ramadan.
Reaction and mean latency times on simple and complex tasks were neither affected by RIF nor time of day. This is consistent with some studies and conflicting with others. Green et al. [25] found no effect of fasting on simple reaction time and sustained attention. These findings are inconsistent with other studies [4, 26] that have shown that tasks requiring rapid reaction (detection and identification tasks) are sensitive to fasting. Bouhlel et al. [27] observed a complex effect of RIF with a negatively impacted simple reaction time at the end of Ramadan and no effect on complex reaction time. Roky et al. [28] reported a delay in movement reaction time only during the first week of Ramadan. In sum, the set of findings suggests that the relationship between fasting and RTI performances is complex because it is context- and moment-dependent [27].
The sustained attention accuracy was significantly increased during Ramadan (RA1 and RA4) as compared to baseline. This is in accordance with Tian et al.'s findings [4] that showed that detection performances were better during Ramadan, supporting the hypothesis that fasting increases detection abilities. Along with these findings, the obtained wellness index value showed that self-reported fatigue significantly increased over the Ramadan period. Consequently, the increase in accuracy during Ramadan seems robust enough to not be negatively impacted by a reported fatigued state. The accuracy increase could also be explained by a potential testhabituation effect or other physiological factors such as blood glucose [29]. In this context, it should be noted that such tests have been shown to be insensitive to any habituation effect [17, 18].
Another important finding of the present study is that at the end of Ramadan, even though the cyclists reported to feel more fatigued, the second measure of the day (0-2 a.m.) RVP accuracy was significantly higher compared to the start of the day measure (4-6 p.m.). This unexpected finding could be explained by a circadian shift and/ or higher concentration of blood glucose, because previous studies showed that higher blood glucose tended to preserve visual processing tasks, at the expenses of speed [30]. Owen et al. [29] found in that regard a glucose facilitation effect for certain cognitive tasks and not others, with a specific effect according to the glucoregulatory status of the subjects. For instance, participants with good glucose regulation actually felt calmer and performed better and faster in several cognitive tests compared to those with poor glucose regulation. As no blood glucose measures were taken and no nutritional logs were collected in the present study, this remains pure speculation that should be further investigated in the future. In this context, it is not clear why this improvement in accuracy was significantly higher for the second measure of the day only at the end of Ramadan and not at the other time points. Consequently, further studies should replicate the study while controlling blood glucose and variables linked to circadian rhythm, such as body temperature.

The variables that might have an impact on cognitive function measures will be discussed hereafter, in order to better understand the study conditions. The cognitive tests were administered to the participants at 2 times of day (TOD), before, during and after Ramadan. This was done because several studies have reported conflicting results when the TOD of the measures was not consistent. To be able to detect possible changes that would occur in the middle of the `day' and `later' when comparing Ramadan with non-Ramadan periods, the present study protocol was set to assess the cyclists at 2 different TOD, keeping a `common' time for absolute comparisons purposes (see methods). This allowed us to detect changes at certain time points, that were not observable at another time of day (see discussion above). We recommend that Ramadan study protocols take into consideration the chronobiology effects in their measures.
Cognitive function measures were collected while training load (TL) varied over the whole 2-month period. Nevertheless, the evolution of weekly TL did not concern the Ramadan period for which the TL was held constant. Therefore, any modification of the measures during Ramadan could not be directly caused by the TL. Despite no significant increase in TL during Ramadan, at the last week of Ramadan, cyclists reported increased perceived fatigue and DOMS. This result is in accordance with previous studies showing increased fatigue at the end of Ramadan [31-33]. When interpreting the data, another factor should be taken into account. Ramadan fasting has also been shown to be accompanied by a possible increase in the exercise perceived exertion [27, 31, 34]. Therefore, even if the RPE method has been validated and used in cyclists [20, 21], the progressive but still non-significant increase in TL observed during Ramadan (fig. 2) could be due to a slight increase in external training load and/or to a progressively impacted exercise perceived exertion. In any case, the results of the present study will have to be interpreted keeping in mind an increase in the reported fatigue towards the end of Ramadan. Also, the measures at post-Ramadan were performed when the TL significantly increased with a concomitant related significant increase in perceived fatigue.
Total sleep duration did not change over the study period, but sleep architecture showed clear disturbances. Indeed, a significantly increased number of awakenings and light sleep duration during Ramadan (RA1 and RA4), and decreased durations of deep and REM sleep stages at post-Ramadan were observed. Previous studies [35, 36] reported reduced sleep durations during Ramadan. In Herrera's [35] study, PSQI questionnaires were used to assess the average sleep duration/patterns in Qatari football players involved in rehabilitation programmes (assessed players were in a free-living setting). In the study of BaHammam et al. [36], armband accelerometry was used. Both studies showed a reduction of total sleep time of about 1 hour. Conversely to these, the present study cyclists were continuously monitored by their technical/medical staff during their training camps. Therefore, the training camp related discipline ensured that a minimum amount of sleep was kept by the cyclists with resulting constancy in total sleep time. In addition, the present

study also confirms what has already been suggested by others [13, 37, 38], with the `living setting' having an important impact on the measures performed during Ramadan. For instance, the above mentioned authors stressed that when the athletes were living in training camps, with monitored sleep, nutritional and hydration patterns, many physical performance measures were not or only slightly affected by Ramadan fasting. Nevertheless, even though mean total sleep duration was not affected in the majority of the cyclists of the present study, some of them (25%) had long primary sleep in the first week of Ramadan and also 25% of them had short primary sleep durations at the end of Ramadan. This shows some sleep disturbance, which was confirmed by the sleep architecture measures. Indeed, Ramadan was accompanied by a significant increase in the duration of light sleep. BaHammam et al. [39] observed in healthy volunteers that Ramadan was accompanied by a decrease in REM sleep percentage, with no difference in sleep latency and non-REM sleep percentage. The increase in light sleep stage duration observed in the present study could be explained by the increase in the number of awakenings reported during Ramadan. This increase in sleep interruptions could be due to the increased metabolism that can take place due to late Sohoor (last meal before starting the fast) and/or increased food-seeking behaviours observed during periods of fasting that can disturb sleep [24]. It should be noted that the ambulatory sleep device used was validated for sleep architecture assessment, with a relative weakness at the level of the number of awakening times count. Nevertheless, even though the number of awakenings could be questioned, their number roughly doubled during Ramadan, suggesting robust changes at the level of this variable. Two weeks after Ramadan, the deep and REM sleep stages significantly diminished compared to baseline while light sleep returned to baseline values. These observed effects could be due to the training load increase effect and/or to a delayed effect of Ramadan. Unfortunately, the design of the present study does not allow these effects to be distinguished due to absence of a control group. Overall, the discussed sections about training and sleep show that the training load was constant, with increased fatigue towards the last week of Ramadan, concomitantly to significant negative effects on sleep architecture. It is important to note that despite reporting impacted sleep architecture/schedule in Muslims fasting during Ramadan, previous investigators [36, 39] reported no effect on the arousal index or daytime sleepiness. Another study also showed no impact of RIF on daytime sleepiness, drowsiness or vigilance [40], suggesting no potential major effect of these variables on cognitive function. In the light of the present study results, it is speculated that the cyclists were probably not in negative alertness and vigilance states. Nevertheless, it has to be noted that other authors contrasted this by reporting a decreased subjective alertness during Ramadan daytime followed by an increase of this variable at night [28]. This increase of night-time alertness could explain the end-of-Ramadan increase in RVP accuracy observed at 0-2 a.m. in the present study.

It should be noted that this particular study showed impacted sleep duration in these subjects. The reason there were no significant changes in cognitive performance and likely no negatively impacted alertness in the present study is probably that the participants of the present study maintained total sleep duration. Therefore, it seems that fasting young athletes are able to maintain their cognitive performances when total sleep duration is maintained in the fasting period.
It is important to note that the cognitive function tests were all performed in resting conditions and not during effort. In that regard, it would be worth studying the effects of Ramadan fasting on the cognitive function of athletes' measures while exercising, for better ecological validity of the measures. As the duration of the present study cognitive tests was quite short (around 10 min), cognitive tests of longer duration should also be studied to be able to draw conclusions on tasks requiring long concentration. It is also important to point out that the present study did not include a `control group'. This limitation is a main characteristic of many experiments about Ramadan fasting [1, 2, 41]. Indeed, when research about Ramadan fasting is performed in a Muslim majority country like in the GCC, it is quite problematic and ethically challenging to find non-fasting counterparts to the participants. Therefore, in such cases, the Ramadan measures are compared to the pre-Ramadan baseline as reference values, as usually reported in the literature.
CONCLUSIONS The present study conducted in Muslim trained cyclists showed stable RTI performances (simple and complex reaction time and movement speed) throughout Ramadan when the training load was held constant. RTI performances were also unaffected even after Ramadan, when training load and fatigue were significantly increased. RVP (rapid visual information processing) performances suggest lower impulsivity of the cyclists during Ramadan, and even improved accuracy towards the end of Ramadan for the second measure of the day. Therefore, the effects of Ramadan intermittent fasting seem to depend on the type of assessed task, time of day of measurement, with no negative impact on the studied selected cognitive measures in the cyclists of the present study.

Cdc42 regulates junctional actin but not cell polarization in the Caenorhabditis elegans epidermis

During morphogenesis, adherens junctions (AJs) remodel to allow changes in cell shape and position while preserving adhesion. Here, we examine the function of Rho guanosine triphosphatase CDC-42 in AJ formation and regulation during Caenorhabditis elegans embryo elongation, a process driven by asymmetric epidermal cell shape changes. cdc42 mutant embryos arrest during elongation with epidermal ruptures. Unexpectedly, we find using time-lapse fluorescence imaging that cdc-42 is not required for epidermal cell polarization or junction assembly, but rather is needed for proper junctional actin regulation during elongation. We show that the RhoGAP PAC-1/ARHGAP21 inhibits CDC-42 activity at AJs, and loss of PAC-1 or the interacting linker protein PICC-1/CCDC85A-C blocks elongation in embryos with compromised AJ function. pac-1 embryos exhibit dynamic accumulations of junctional F-actin and an increase in AJ protein levels. Our findings identify a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism for inhibiting junctional CDC42 to control actin organization and AJ protein levels during epithelial morphogenesis.

Introduction
Polarized cell shape changes provide forces that alter the morphology of tissues, organs, and embryos. For example, changes in the shapes of Caenorhabditis elegans epidermal cells transform the embryo from an ellipse into an elongated wormshaped cylinder in the absence of cell division. Epidermal cells are born on the dorsal surface of the embryo, then migrate ventrally and form new junctions with contralateral epidermal cells to wrap the embryo in skin ("ventral enclosure"; Chisholm and Hardin, 2005; Vuong-Brender et al., 2016). After completing ventral enclosure, epidermal cells begin to lengthen along their anterior-posterior axis and simultaneously shrink along their dorsal-ventral axis ("elongation"; Fig. 1 A). Actomyosin contractions in lateral epidermal cells provide the forces that alter epidermal cell shape during the early stage of elongation (Armenti and Nance, 2012; Cram, 2014; Vuong-Brender et al., 2016). Subsequently, the contraction of underlying muscles attached to epidermal cells provides forces that allow elongation to continue up to the fourfold stage (Armenti and Nance, 2012; Cram, 2014; Vuong-Brender et al., 2016). It is unclear how epidermal cells regulate adherens junctions (AJs) and their associated microfilaments during elongation to allow the remodeling needed for these asymmetric cell shape changes while still preserving cell adhesion. This problem is common to all types of epithelial cells that alter their shapes or change positions relative to neighbors during morphogenesis (Collinet and Lecuit, 2013; Röper, 2015).

C. elegans AJs contain highly conserved components, including the transmembrane homophilic adhesion protein HMR-1/E-cadherin and the cytoplasmic catenins HMP-1/catenin and HMP-2/-catenin, which interact with the HMR1/E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail and link it to actin microfilaments (Costa et al., 1998; Korswagen et al., 2000; Kwiatkowski et al., 2010). Null mutations in hmr-1/E-cadherin, hmp-1/-catenin, or hmp-2/-catenin cause microfilaments to detach from AJs as epidermal cells elongate, leading to developmental arrest and epidermal rupture (Costa et al., 1998). In addition to -catenin and -catenin, the p120 catenin JAC-1 also binds to the cytoplasmic tail of HMR-1/E-cadherin (Pettitt et al., 2003). Although JAC-1 is not essential in C. elegans (Klompstra et al., 2015), its depletion enhances the phenotype of weak mutations in hmp-1 (Pettitt et al., 2003), indicating that JAC-1 is an important regulator of AJ function.
AJs form through a two-step process of polarization and junction maturation. These events occur during the middle of embryogenesis, when epithelial precursor cells undergo a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). During the polarization step of MET, clusters of AJ proteins found along the lateral membrane concentrate at the apicolateral region of the cell (Leung et al., 1999; McMahon et al., 2001; Achilleos et al., 2010). Concomitantly, polarity regulators begin to occupy distinct subdomains at the cell surface: the adaptor protein PAR-6 localizes apically, the scaffolding protein PAR-3 concentrates

at AJs, the Discs large homologue DLG-1 accumulates at the basal side of AJs, and the Scribble protein LET-413 localizes to basolateral surfaces (Legouis et al., 2000; Bossinger et al., 2001; Firestein and Rongo, 2001; Köppen et al., 2001; McMahon et al., 2001; Aono et al., 2004; Achilleos et al., 2010). Whereas PAR-3 mediates polarization of other epithelial cell types in C. elegans (Köppen et al., 2001; Aono et al., 2004; Achilleos et al., 2010), epidermal cells polarize through an unknown PAR-3-independent mechanism. Junction maturation requires PAR-6, DLG-1, and LET-413; embryos lacking any of these polarity regulators arrest during elongation (Legouis et al., 2000; Bossinger et al., 2001; Firestein and Rongo, 2001; Köppen et al., 2001; McMahon et al., 2001; Totong et al., 2007).
One important regulator of AJs that has not been examined during epidermal cell MET or elongation is the Rho GTPase CDC-42. Active CDC-42 can interface with PAR proteins by binding directly to the PAR-6 CRIB (CDC-42/Rac interactive binding) domain (Gotta et al., 2001; Aceto et al., 2006), and interfering with CDC-42 function in many epithelial cell types disrupts polarity or the turnover of AJ components, leading to epithelial defects (Tepass, 2012; Duquette and Lamarche-Vane, 2014; Mack and Georgiou, 2014). For example, Cdc42 is required for apical membrane differentiation in the blastoderm

of Drosophila melanogaster embryos (Hutterer et al., 2004) and in epithelial MDCK cells grown in 3D culture (MartinBelmonte et al., 2007). Removing Cdc42 in fully polarized Drosophila epithelia causes defects in AJ organization by altering endocytosis or exocytosis, depending on the tissue (Georgiou et al., 2008; Harris and Tepass, 2008; Leibfried et al., 2008). CDC-42 can also regulate junction stability by controlling actin polymerization and turnover. For instance, multiple actinnucleating factors, such as the Arp2/3 complex and formins, function downstream of CDC-42 to influence F-actin organization at junctions (Otani et al., 2006; Verma et al., 2012; Phng et al., 2015; Rao and Zaidel-Bar, 2016). In turn, junctional F-actin can modulate AJs by affecting endocytosis, or by physically controlling E-cadherin clustering (Collinet and Lecuit, 2013; Truong Quang et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2015).
Because CDC-42 is widely distributed in cells and regulates many different events (Erickson and Cerione, 2001), its activity at specific subcellular locations is often locally controlled. Like other Rho GTPases, CDC-42 is active when bound to GTP and inactive when bound to GDP. RhoGEFs activate CDC-42 and other Rho GTPases by promoting GTP binding, whereas RhoGAPs function as inhibitors by promoting GTP hydrolysis (Bos et al., 2007). Studies using constitutively active

and dominant negative versions of CDC-42 have shown that its activity must be regulated to ensure normal junction formation and maintenance (Kroschewski et al., 1999; Rojas et al., 2001; Bruewer et al., 2004; Elbediwy et al., 2012), indicating that RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs are likely to influence CDC-42 activity at junctions. In cultured mammalian epithelial cells, CDC-42 activity is tuned at different stages of junction biogenesis by a small number of GEFs and GAPs, including the RhoGEFs Tuba and Dbl3/ARHGEF21 (Otani et al., 2006; Zihni et al., 2014) and the RhoGAPs Rich1 and SH3BP1 (Wells et al., 2006; Elbediwy et al., 2012). However, it remains unclear which RhoGEFs or RhoGAPs function in vivo to regulate CDC-42 activity as junctions remodel during morphogenesis.
Here, we show that, unexpectedly, CDC-42 is dispensable for polarization and junction maturation during MET in the C. elegans epidermis, but is essential during elongation to control the polarized cell shape changes and junctional actin dynamics of epidermal cells. We identify the conserved RhoGAP PAC-1/ARHGAP21, which localizes specifically to AJs and likely functions with its binding partner PICC-1/ CCDC85A-C, as a negative regulator of CDC-42 activity at these sites. pac-1 mutant embryos form ectopic, dynamic, actin extensions at AJs, exhibit increased AJ protein levels, and fail to elongate in a sensitized genetic background. Our findings reveal that RhoGAP-mediated CDC-42 regulation enables tight control over actin organization and AJ protein levels in vivo, allowing epithelial cells to remodel their junctions efficiently as cells change shape.
Results
CDC-42 is required for proper ventral enclosure and embryo elongation
C. elegans has a single cdc-42 homologue, which is expressed ubiquitously in embryos, larvae, and adults (Anderson et al., 2008; Armenti et al., 2014b; Neukomm et al., 2014). Within the embryo, CDC-42 protein arises from both maternal and zygotic sources. Reducing levels of maternal CDC-42 results in a loss of polarity and defects in spindle orientation in early embryos, culminating in embryonic lethality (Gotta et al., 2001; Kay and Hunter, 2001; Anderson et al., 2008). We examined cdc-42 function in later embryos by using a degron-based strategy to deplete maternal CDC-42 protein from the early embryo just after its function in the one-cell embryo is complete, while simultaneously eliminating zygotic cdc-42 expression with a cdc42 null allele, gk388 (Anderson et al., 2008). Proteins tagged with the PIE-1 zinc finger 1 (ZF1) domain are recognized by the E3 ligase adaptor ZIF-1, which causes the tagged proteins to degrade rapidly from early embryonic somatic cells after the one-cell stage (Reese et al., 2000; DeRenzo et al., 2003; Nance et al., 2003). However, because ZIF-1 appears to be present only in early embryos (Armenti et al., 2014b), ZF1-tagged proteins that are expressed zygotically at later embryonic stages do not degrade. CDC-42 fused at its N-terminus with HA tags and the ZF1 domain (Anderson et al., 2008) largely rescued the lethality of cdc-42 mutants (84% [389/463] of cdc-42[gk388]; ha-zf1-cdc-42 embryos were viable) and degraded rapidly from early embryonic somatic cells before its zygotic expression began during the middle of embryogenesis (Fig. S1, A-B; Anderson et al., 2008). To obtain embryos lacking cdc-42 activity, we allowed cdc-42; ha-zf1-cdc-42/+ hermaphrodites to

self-fertilize (Fig. S1 C, Strategy I). One quarter of the resulting progeny should lack the ha-zf1-cdc-42 transgene, and because the maternal HA-ZF1-CDC-42 protein is degraded, these embryos will be left with no maternal or zygotic source of CDC-42 (Fig. S1 C, right). Hereafter, we refer to such embryos as cdc42(MZ). Of the self-progeny of cdc-42; ha-zf1-cdc-42/+ heterozygotes, 24% (116/479) died before hatching. PCR genotyping showed that 84% (15/18) of randomly selected dead embryos were cdc-42(MZ), whereas the remaining 16% (3/18) contained the ha-zf1-cdc-42 transgene but failed to rescue. Thus, although ha-zf1-cdc-42 transgene largely rescues the cdc-42(gk388) mutant phenotype, it does not do so completely. All healthy genotyped L1 larvae contained the ha-zf1-cdc-42 transgene (19/19), whereas a small number of cdc-42(MZ) embryos died soon after hatching into sickly larvae. We conclude that cdc-42 has an essential function during the second half of embryonic development, after zygotic cdc-42 expression begins.
We used 3D time-lapse differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging to examine the dynamics of ventral enclosure and elongation in live cdc-42(MZ) embryos (Fig. 1, B and C; and Video 1). Of 135 embryos imaged from a cdc-42; ha-zf1cdc-42/+ mother, 39 (29%) did not hatch. Based on the results of our genotyping, 86% of unhatched embryos are predicted to be cdc-42(MZ) embryos, whereas the remaining small percentage of arrested embryos are predicted to contain the ha-zf1-cdc-42 transgene. Arrested embryos were assigned to three phenotypic classes according to the final stage of morphogenesis they completed (Fig. 1 D): Class I embryos (17/39, 44%) failed to complete ventral enclosure and therefore arrested before elongation; Class II embryos ruptured in the head ventral region early in elongation, typically at the 1.5-fold stage (8/39, 20%; Fig. 1 C); Class III embryos arrested later during elongation, at or after the twofold stage, with extruded cells (14/39, 36%). Embryos that arrested during elongation also elongated at a slower rate than embryos that developed to hatching (Fig. 1 E). Based on these observations and our genotyping data, we conclude that loss of cdc-42 activity causes significant morphogenetic defects that are apparent during ventral enclosure and elongation, and that cause embryonic arrest before elongation is complete.
CDC-42 is dispensable for polarity establishment and junction maturation
We next tested if there were defects in epidermal cell polarization or junction maturation in cdc-42(MZ) embryos that could explain their arrest phenotype. CDC-42 is thought to promote epithelial cell polarization by recruiting PAR-6 to the apical surface; this interaction occurs through the PAR-6 CRIB domain, which binds directly to active CDC-42 (Joberty et al., 2000; Johansson et al., 2000; Lin et al., 2000; Qiu et al., 2000; Gotta et al., 2001; Hutterer et al., 2004; Aceto et al., 2006). Unexpectedly, PAR-6 still accumulated at the apical membrane of epidermal cells (Fig. 2 B, red arrow) in cdc-42(MZ) embryos, even though the apical to cytoplasmic ratio of PAR-6 immunostaining in the epidermis of cdc-42(MZ) mutants was decreased twofold compared with control embryos (Fig. 2, A, E, and F). To rule out the possibility that a trace amount of HA-ZF1-CDC-42 beyond our limit of detection remained in cdc-42(MZ) embryos and was sufficient to recruit PAR-6, we examined the localization of a previously characterized form of PAR-6 with mutations in the CRIB domain that make it unable to bind CDC-42 (Aceto et al., 2006). PAR-6CRIBGFP, expressed from endogenous regulatory sequences and

examined in a par-6(MZ) mutant background, localized similarly to endogenous PAR-6 in cdc-42(MZ) mutants, with strong apical enrichment in epithelial cells that was less pronounced but still evident in epidermal cells (compared with PAR-6GFP in wild-type; Fig. 2, C, D, and G). However, par-6(MZ); par-6CRIB-gfp embryos arrested before the 1.7-fold stage of elongation (27/27), in contrast with par-6(MZ); par-6-gfp embryos, which nearly all survived (95%, 232/243). Thus, whereas neither CDC-42 nor the PAR-6 CRIB domain is essential for PAR-6 apical enrichment, both contribute to enriching PAR-6 apically within epidermal cells, and the CRIB domain is needed for PAR-6 function.
Because PAR-6 is required for junction maturation, we asked whether the decreased apical enrichment of PAR-6 in

cdc-42(MZ) epidermal cells blocked or slowed junction formation or maturation. We examined junctions when epidermal cells first polarized via MET using fluorescence time-lapse imaging of two junction proteins: the E-cadherin HMR-1-GFP expressed from a knockin allele, and the Discs large protein DLG-1-RFP expressed from an integrated transgene. To genotype live cdc-42(MZ) embryos, we created a functional zf1-yfpcdc-42 knockin allele, placed this in trans to the cdc-42(gk388) null mutation, and selected YFP-negative self-progeny embryos (cdc-42[gk388] homozygotes; Fig. S1 D, Strategy II). Such embryos had no detectable levels of YFP, indicating that maternal ZF1-YFP-CDC-42 degradation was efficient (Fig. S1, D and E). To visualize HMR-1-GFP during junction formation, we acquired an image stack from the dorsal surface to the center

of the embryo. This allowed us to observe MET en face (in epidermal cells) and in cross section (in epidermal and intestinal cells). At initial stages of polarization in control embryos, the intensity of HMR-1-GFP was low and uneven along contacts at the apicolateral edges of epidermal cells (Fig. 2 H and Video 2). As cells polarized, HMR-1-GFP localized evenly at apicolateral AJs. Junction formation in cdc-42(MZ) embryos was indistinguishable from control embryos (Fig. 2 I), and the junctional to lateral ratio of HMR-1-GFP in polarized epidermal cells was not significantly different (Fig. 2 J). As in epidermal cells, intestinal epithelial cells of cdc-42(MZ) embryos showed normal polarization of HMR-1-GFP during MET (Video 3). We obtained similar results for DLG-1-RFP, which, like HMR-1-GFP, initially formed puncta at epithelial cell-cell contacts before puncta coalesced into a continuous apicolateral belt-like structure (Fig. S2, A-B; and Video 4).
We examined additional markers to determine if cdc-42 is dispensable for other aspects of epidermal cell polarization. PAR-3-GFP still accumulated apically in cdc-42(MZ) epidermal cells, albeit with a mild but significant decrease in apical enrichment compared with wild-type (Fig. S2, C-E). Immunostaining for endogenous proteins at AJs (HMP-1), basal junctions (DLG-1), and the basolateral membrane (LET-413) did not reveal any mislocalization in cdc-42(MZ) mutant embryos (Fig. 2, K and L; and Fig. S2, F and G). Altogether, our live-imaging experiments with fluorescently tagged junction proteins and examination of endogenous polarity proteins in fixed embryos demonstrate that, surprisingly, cdc-42 is not required for epidermal cell polarization or junction maturation during the process of MET.
CDC-42 regulation is important for elongation
We next addressed the consequences of increasing cdc-42 activity. In contrast with cdc-42 loss of function, overexpressing cdc-42 using a functional gfp-cdc-42 transgene (Neukomm et al., 2014) did not cause any significant defects or lethality in

an otherwise wild-type background (Table 1). However, gfpcdc-42 overexpression decreased embryonic survival in a genetically sensitized hmp-1(fe4) background, which has been used to identify genes that contribute to AJ function (Pettitt et al., 2003; Cox-Paulson et al., 2012; Lynch et al., 2012). The fe4 mutation compromises the ability of HMP-1/-catenin to bind F-actin (Maiden and Hardin, 2011) and results in 52% of embryos arresting during elongation, whereas 48% survive through embryogenesis (Pettitt et al., 2003; Table 1). However, only 19% of hmp-1(fe4); gfp-cdc-42 embryos survived, hatching into misshapen larvae similar to hmp-1(fe4) larvae (Table 1). 12% of hmp-1(fe4); gfp-cdc-42 embryos arrested at ventral enclosure (Class I), whereas the remainder developed dorsal epidermal bulges and arrested during elongation, reaching at most the twofold stage (Fig. S3, A and E; and Video 5). This enhancement of lethality was similar to that caused by overexpressing rho-1 (RhoA), which also decreased survival of hmp-1(fe4) mutants to 19%, whereas overexpressing ced-10 (Rac) had no effect on hmp-1(fe4) lethality (Table 1). The effect of overexpressing rho-1 is not surprising because RHO-1 activity must be attenuated by RhoGAP activity in epidermal cells to control tension during elongation (Diogon et al., 2007). These findings suggest that the activity of CDC-42, like RHO-1, might be regulated to ensure proper embryo elongation.
RhoGAP PAC-1 localizes to AJs and regulates elongation
To determine where CDC-42 might function to regulate elongation, we examined the localization of a functional HA-CDC-42 fusion protein (Anderson et al., 2008) within epidermal cells. HA-CDC-42 was enriched at the plasma membrane, including AJs, which we visualized by costaining for HMR-1 (Fig. 3 A). Because epidermal cell AJs must remodel as the cells change shape during elongation, and given the genetic interactions we observed between overexpressed cdc-42 and hmp-1(fe4) mutants, we searched for candidate regulators of CDC-42 activity that localize to AJs. In early embryos, the RhoGAP PAC-1

(human ARHGAP21) interacts physically with proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic tail of HMR-1/E-cadherin, where it functions to inhibit CDC-42 activity and control cell polarity (Anderson et al., 2008; Klompstra et al., 2015). A functional mCherry-PAC-1 fusion protein expressed from a recombineered fosmid was detected in epithelial cells and concentrated at junctions (Fig. 3 B). mCherry-PAC-1 colocalized nearly completely with HMR-1, but was significantly more apical than DLG-1, which is found basal to AJs (Fig. S4, A and B), indicating that PAC-1 is present at AJs. mCherry-PAC-1 also overlapped with the more broadly localized GFP-CDC-42 at AJs (Fig. 3 D), raising the possibility that PAC-1 inhibits a junctional pool of CDC-42 during elongation.
If PAC-1 inhibits CDC-42, then pac-1 mutants, similar to overexpressed cdc-42, should enhance the embryonic lethality of hmp-1(fe4) mutants. pac-1(xn6) contains a premature stop codon predicted to truncate the protein before the RhoGAP domain (Anderson et al., 2008). Although pac-1(xn6) mutants have defects in cell positioning during gastrulation, most embryos recover and hatch with normal morphology (Fig. 4 B, Table 1, and 2; Anderson et al., 2008). In contrast, pac-1(xn6) strongly enhanced the lethality of hmp-1(fe4) mutants (Fig. 4 D and Tables 1 and S1). The majority of hmp-1(fe4); pac-1(xn6) embryos elongated more slowly than hmp-1(fe4) or pac-1(xn6) single mutants (Fig. 4 E). For example, more than half of arrested hmp-1(fe4) mutant embryos reached the twofold stage or greater (Class III, 58%; Fig. 4 F and Video 6), whereas nearly all hmp-1(fe4); pac-1(xn6) embryos arrested before the twofold

stage of elongation (Class II, 97%; Fig. 4 F). Although hmp1(fe4); pac-1(xn6) embryos arrested early in elongation, all embryos completed ventral enclosure and arrested after the appearance of dorsal epidermal bulges (Fig. 4 D, arrow). The elongation phenotype of hmp-1(fe4); pac-1(xn6) embryos was nearly as severe as that of hmp-1(fe4) embryos treated with hmp-1 RNAi, which also formed dorsal bulges and arrested during, or just after, ventral enclosure (Fig. S3 D). The enhanced lethality of hmp-1(fe4); pac-1(xn6) embryos was reversed to the level seen in hmp-1(fe4) alone by expressing wild-type mCherry-PAC-1 from a transgene, but was not affected by expressing comparable levels of mCherry-PAC-1(R984A), which contains a mutation that inactivates the RhoGAP domain (Anderson et al., 2008) without disrupting expression level or localization to AJs (Table 1 and Fig. S5, A and B). Altogether, these findings indicate that the RhoGAP activity of PAC-1 is important for elongation and raise the possibility that PAC-1 regulates AJs by functioning as a RhoGAP that locally inhibits CDC-42.
PAC-1 regulates elongation by inhibiting CDC-42
If PAC-1 inhibits CDC-42 through its RhoGAP activity, then CDC-42 should be overactive in embryos lacking PAC-1 activity. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we asked whether reducing cdc-42 gene dosage rescued the enhanced lethality of hmp-1(fe4) caused by pac-1 inactivation. Indeed, hmp1(fe4); cdc-42/+ embryos were significantly less affected by pac-1 RNAi than hmp-1(fe4) mutants (Fig. 5 A). This finding

suggests that CDC-42 is overactive in pac-1(RNAi) embryos, and that overactive CDC-42 contributes to the lethality of hmp-1(fe4) pac-1(RNAi) embryos.
To determine whether CDC-42 is active at AJs, we altered a maternally expressed biosensor consisting of the G protein- binding domain (GBD) of WSP-1/Wasp fused to GFP, which was shown to specifically report on CDC-42 activity (Kumfer et al., 2010) by expressing it from cdc-42 regulatory sequences. In epidermal cells, the CDC-42 biosensor concentrated at AJs (Fig. 5 B). Partial depletion of cdc-42 by RNAi caused the biosensor to relocate from AJs to the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 5 C), demonstrating that it reports on CDC-42 activity. In embryos overexpressing mCherry-PAC-1, biosensor levels at AJs were significantly decreased in comparison with embryos overexpressing GAP-dead mCherry-PAC-1(R984A) (Fig. 5 D). Altogether, these findings indicate that PAC-1 regulates the activity of CDC-42 at AJs to modulate elongation of the embryo.

PAC-1 likely functions with interacting linker protein PICC-1
At sites of contact between early embryonic cells, the coiledcoil protein PICC-1 (CCDC85A-C in humans) couples PAC-1 to HMR-1 by binding to both PAC-1 and the p120 catenin JAC-1 (Klompstra et al., 2015). Mammalian CCDC85B (also known as DIPA) can interact with p120 and localizes to AJs, although its function is unknown (Markham et al., 2014). To determine if PICC-1 might function with PAC-1 at epidermal cell AJs, we first examined the localization of a PICC-1-GFP fusion protein expressed from a recombineered genomic clone. PICC-1-GFP was present at AJs, where it colocalized with mCherry-PAC-1 (Fig. 3 C and Fig. S4 B).
Like pac-1(xn6) mutants, picc-1(xn14) null mutants are viable (Klompstra et al., 2015; Table 1). Given that PAC-1 and PICC-1 have been shown to function together, we asked whether picc-1 also interacts genetically with hmp-1(fe4). Nearly all

hmp-1(fe4); picc-1(xn14) and hmp-1(fe4) picc-1(RNAi) embryos arrested, and did so at a similar stage as pac-1(xn6); hmp-1(fe4) embryos (Tables 1 and S1; Fig. S3, B and E; and Video 7). pac-1(xn6); picc-1(xn14) double mutants were also viable, like each single mutant, consistent with the genes functioning together in the same pathway (Table 1). Because PICC-1 links PAC-1 to JAC-1, we also examined genetic interactions between jac-1 and pac-1. jac-1(xn15) null mutants are viable (Klompstra et al., 2015) and enhanced the lethality of hmp-1(fe4) mutants to the same extent as pac-1(xn6) (Tables 1 and S1), with embryos arresting before the twofold stage of elongation (Fig. S3, C and E). However, 30% of jac-1(xn15); pac-1(xn6) double null mutants died. Thus, whereas PAC-1 and JAC-1 may function together at AJs, one or both proteins likely have independent functions that are important for elongation.
AJ protein levels are increased in pac-1 mutant embryos
Because PAC-1 localized to AJs and regulated elongation, we asked whether the localization or level of junction proteins was abnormal in embryos lacking pac-1 function. To quantify protein levels, we used functional HMR-1-mCherry, JAC-1-GFP, and HMP-1-GFP fluorescent reporters expressed from transgenes in living embryos. Each protein concentrated at epidermal AJs in both wild-type and pac-1(RNAi) embryos. However, their levels at AJs were significantly increased in pac-1(RNAi) embryos relative to wild-type (Fig. 6, A and B; and Fig. S5 C). To confirm that the observed AJ protein increases were not limited to overexpressed transgenic proteins, we examined HMR1-GFP expressed from a knockin allele (Marston et al., 2016); HMR-1-GFP showed a similar increase in pac-1(xn6) mutants relative to wild-type (Fig. S5, D). In contrast with AJ proteins, the amount of DLG-1-GFP present at junctions was not increased in pac-1(RNAi) embryos (Fig. 6 C), consistent with the localization of DLG-1 to a separate junctional zone (Fig. S4).
Depletion of picc-1 also caused an increase in junctional HMR-1-mCherry levels (Fig. 6 D), further suggesting that

PAC-1 and PICC-1 function together. To determine whether the increase in AJ protein levels after loss of PAC-1 or PICC-1 could be caused by an increase in CDC-42 activity, we examined levels of HMR-1-mCherry in embryos expressing constitutively active CDC-42 specifically in the epidermis ("cdc-42[CA]" embryos; Fig. S5 E). HMR-1-mCherry remained concentrated at AJs in cdc-42(CA) embryos, but its levels were increased relative to wild-type (Fig. 6 E; compare with Fig. 6 A). We conclude that an increase in CDC-42 activity in epidermal cells is sufficient to augment levels of AJ proteins at junctions, suggesting that this is the basis for the increased AJ protein levels observed in pac-1(RNAi) and picc-1(RNAi) embryos.
CDC-42 activity levels affect junctional actin dynamics during elongation
Because CDC-42 can also regulate actin polymerization, we analyzed junctional F-actin in pac-1(xn6) embryos. To determine whether junctional F-actin is aberrant, we expressed LifeAct-GFP within epidermal cells and captured high frame rate near-total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) movies during elongation (Fig. 7). In control embryos, actin filaments at AJs formed thick bundles that did not change their morphology (Fig. 7 A and Video 8). However, in pac-1(xn6) embryos, we observed multiple dynamic junction-associated actin extensions protruding in various directions from the junctional actin belt over the same imaging interval (Fig. 7 B and Video 8). To quantify actin dynamics, we calculated the SD of LifeAct-GFP intensity at each pixel throughout the imaging period, which was normalized to the mean pixel intensity to adjust for variation in transgene expression level. This value, displayed as a heat map in images (Fig. 7, A-C), reports on the dynamics of F-actin extensions at a given location. Compared with control embryos, F-actin in pac1(xn6) mutant embryos was significantly more dynamic at epidermal AJs (Fig. 7, B and D). F-Actin also appeared less concentrated at junctions and significantly more dynamic in cdc-42(MZ) embryos (Fig. 7, C and E), suggesting that

cycling of cdc-42 activity is needed for proper F-actin organization and dynamics at AJs.
At a later stage of elongation (beginning at the 1.7-fold stage), actin fibers in dorsal and ventral cells become reorganized into circumferential bundles (CFBs; Fig. 7 F; Costa et al., 1998). At this stage, AJs in pac-1(xn6) embryos no longer exhibited ectopic actin extensions (data not depicted). Thus, pac-1 inactivation causes a transient increase in dynamic junctional

F-actin extensions during the early stages of elongation--when pac-1(xn6) mutant embryos in the hmp-1(fe4) sensitized background arrest. In 18 of 18 hmp-1(fe4); pac-1(xn6) embryos imaged during elongation, circumferential actin bundles were visibly detached from junctions (Fig. 7 H), and sites of detachment corresponded to regions where bulges of epidermis formed on the dorsal surface. Separation of circumferential actin bundles from AJs occurs in hmp-1 null mutant embryos (Costa et

Discussion

As a direct regulator of PAR polarity proteins, actin polymerization factors, and vesicle trafficking proteins (Mack and Georgiou, 2014), CDC-42 is positioned to control diverse cell biological events that are critical to AJ formation and remodeling. Here, we have taken advantage of two strengths of C. elegans embryos--the ability to remove CDC-42 function acutely before epithelial cells form, and the capability to visualize the dynamics of junction proteins and associated actin microfilaments in living embryos--to define how CDC-42 contributes to junction formation and remodeling during epithelial morphogenesis. Our findings provide two new insights into CDC42 function and regulation. First, we show that cdc-42 mutant epidermal cells are able to polarize and undergo junction maturation normally during MET, contrasting with interpretations from studies in several other systems. Second, we identify a conserved pathway containing the RhoGAP PAC-1/ARH GAP21 and its binding partner PICC-1/CCDC85A-C, which inhibits CDC-42 activity at AJs (Fig. 8). We show that PAC1, PICC-1, and appropriate CDC-42 activity are important for proper junctional actin organization and levels of AJ proteins, and contribute to the fidelity of epidermal cell shape changes.
Cdc42 and epithelial polarity
Numerous studies that examined cultured epithelial cell lines or fixed tissues in genetic model organisms have concluded that cdc-42 is required for epithelial cell polarization. For example, in the early Drosophila embryo, expressing dominant-negative Cdc42 blocks apicobasal polarization of the blastoderm epithelium (Hutterer et al., 2004). Similarly, conditional Cdc42 knockout in several mammalian cell types, including 3D-cultured MDCK cells, mouse mammary epithelial cells, the developing kidney, and pancreatic epithelial cells, results in defective apicobasal polarity of tubular epithelia (Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007; Kesavan et al., 2009; Elias et al., 2015; Druso et al., 2016). However, these and other studies did not examine the initial stages of epithelial polarization as it unfolded using time-lapse microscopy, leaving it unclear whether the observed polarity phenotypes result from a failure to initially establish polarity, or rather a rapid loss of polarity caused by defects in its maintenance. Here, we addressed the role of CDC-42 in polarizing C. elegans epithelial cells by removing CDC-42 protein acutely from embryos before precursor cells differentiate into epithelia, and observing polarization and junction maturation live using fluorescent time-lapse microscopy of polarity and junction proteins (HMR-1, DLG-1, PAR-3). These results demonstrate that CDC-42 is dispensable for the epithelia we examined (epidermis and intestine) to establish apicobasal polarity or to form mature junctions. The only defects we noted were a reduced level of apical PAR-6 and PAR-3 enrichment in epidermal cells, although both proteins were still apically localized. To confirm these results and to rule out the possibility that trace amounts of CDC-42 might remain in cdc-42(MZ) mutants to facilitate polarization, we examined the localization of a CRIB mutant form of PAR-6 unable to bind to CDC-42 (Aceto et al., 2006). CRIB mutant PAR-6 still accumulated apically in

Figure 8. Model for PAC-1 inhibition of CDC-42 at AJs. See Discussion text for details. Different populations of actin are shown, including junctional actin and CFBs, which align apically to connect one side of the cell to another.
polarizing epithelia, albeit with reduced apical enrichment in epidermal cells, similar to endogenous PAR-6 in cdc-42(MZ) mutants. A previously published examination of intestinal PAR-6 in larvae partially depleted of cdc-42 using RNAi, as well as of embryos expressing maternal CRIB mutant PAR-6 (in par-6(+) embryos), made similar observations (partial loss of apical PAR-6) and concluded that CDC-42 was required for PAR-6 apical accumulation (Shafaq-Zadah et al., 2012). However, these studies are consistent with our observations using embryos entirely lacking CDC-42 protein, or expressing CRIB mutant PAR-6 in the absence of endogenous PAR-6, and point to a partial requirement for CDC-42 in apical PAR-6 accumulation as well as a redundant, CDC-42-independent mechanism for PAR-6 localization that does not use the CRIB domain. Our findings therefore indicate that CDC-42 is not required for polarity establishment or junction formation in C. elegans epidermal and intestinal epithelial cells.
What might explain the differences we observe in C. elegans embryonic epithelia and epithelia in other model systems that depend on Cdc42 for polarity? One possibility is that some cells use alternative or redundant polarization pathways. This may very well be the case, as there is increasing evidence that "core" epithelial polarity proteins, for example PAR-3, are required for polarization of some epithelial cell types but not others, even within the same organism (Achilleos et al., 2010). Moreover, deletion of Cdc42 from some cell types, such as keratinocytes or embryonic stem cell-derived endothelial cells, does not inhibit AJ formation (Erasmus et al., 2010; Qi et al., 2011). A formal possibility is that one or more C. elegans Racs function redundantly with CDC-42 in polarization, because in

3738 JCB · Volume 216 · Number 11 · 2017

mammals, Rac also binds the PAR-6 CRIB domain (Joberty et al., 2000; Johansson et al., 2000; Lin et al., 2000; Qiu et al., 2000). However, it is unknown whether this interaction occurs in C. elegans, and because CRIB mutant PAR-6 still enriches apically, this interaction would have to use a different mechanism than the CDC-42-PAR-6 interaction. An alternative and nonexclusive possibility is that CDC-42 is required only for the maintenance of epithelial junctions (a conserved role--see next section), which in different cell types and organisms have varying degrees of importance in maintaining polarity. For example, early mouse embryos lacking E-cadherin show strong polarity defects, whereas E-cadherin is not needed for polarity in C. elegans epithelia, and is needed for polarity maintenance but not establishment in the Drosophila blastoderm (Harris and Peifer, 2004; Stephenson et al., 2010; Von Stetina and Mango, 2015). Studies in other model systems, in particular cells lacking cdc-42 before they undergo MET and examined by fluorescence timelapse imaging, will be needed to help resolve these possibilities.
CDC-42 and junction regulation
CDC-42 has a conserved role in trafficking AJ proteins and regulating actin polymerization at junctions, helping to ensure an appropriate balance between cell adhesion and junction remodeling during morphogenetic events. Here, we showed that loss of CDC-42 affects junction integrity, and alters actin organization and dynamics at AJs. One class of cdc-42(MZ) mutant embryos arrested before, or just after, completion of ventral enclosure. This finding suggests that CDC-42 may contribute to the migration of epidermal cell sheets, or to the genesis of new epidermal AJs that form at the ventral surface as ventral enclosure completes. Both processes might be affected by the changes in actin morphology and dynamics that we observed in cdc-42 mutants. Our observations are consistent with a study showing that loss of the RhoGAP rga-7, which can regulate CDC-42 activity, causes defects in ventral enclosure (Ouellette et al., 2016). However, in contrast with pac-1, rga-7 does not appear to inhibit CDC42 activity, but rather contributes to the localization of active CDC-42 clusters along junctions of migrating epidermal cells (Ouellette et al., 2016). Another study identified defects in epidermal cell intercalations in embryos with compromised CDC42 activity, pointing to a potential role in junction regulation or cell movement (Walck-Shannon et al., 2016).
A second class of cdc-42(MZ) mutants completed ventral enclosure and arrested at variable stages of elongation. We consider it unlikely that these elongation defects are an indirect consequence of ventral enclosure defects, because failure to properly form junctions at the ventral surface upon the completion of ventral enclosure typically leads to rupture at the beginning of elongation (Costa et al., 1998). In addition, our analysis of overexpressed gfp-cdc-42, pac-1 mutants, and picc-1 mutants in the hmp-1(fe4) background, revealed roles primarily in elongation but not ventral enclosure. We propose that CDC-42 contributes to both events, and that distinct regulators may be used during ventral enclosure and elongation to control CDC42 activity sequentially.
Increasing the activity of junctional CDC-42 augmented levels of HMR-1 and its associated catenins at AJs, and also resulted in aberrant junctional F-actin organization and dynamics. Because CDC-42 effectors include proteins that regulate trafficking as well as those that control actin polymerization (Harris and Tepass, 2010), it is possible that these phenotypes are uncoupled and arise independently. Alternatively, given

that F-actin is involved in vesicle trafficking and that AJs directly link to junctional microfilaments, it is feasible that the two phenotypes are coupled. It is also unclear whether it is the increase in junction protein levels, and/or the disorganization of F-actin at junctions, that causes elongation defects in hmp1(fe4); pac-1 mutants. For example, overexpression of Drosophila E-cadherin inhibits tracheal development (Shindo et al., 2008) and wound repair (Hunter et al., 2015), and inhibition of E-cadherin endocytosis results in cell intercalation defects in the early Drosophila embryo (Levayer et al., 2011). In addition, depleting actin-bundling protein EEF1A in human keratinocytes, which augments the actin turnover rate and increases junctional E-cadherin levels, leaves junctions more sensitive to mechanical stress (Erasmus et al., 2016). These and other studies indicate that increased levels of E-cadherin at junctions do not necessarily indicate that junctions are "stronger." Given the altered organization and dynamics of F-actin at junctions that we observed in pac-1 mutants, it is also likely that F-actin cannot connect as efficiently to AJs as in wild-type embryos.
PAC-1 and PICC-1 homologues localize to AJs in mammals (Sousa et al., 2005; Markham et al., 2014; Van Itallie et al., 2014), and the PAC-1 homologue ARHG AP21 has been shown to inhibit CDC-42 in cultured cells (Barcellos et al., 2013), suggesting that these proteins have deeply conserved roles in regulating junctional CDC-42. Although the in vivo functions of mammalian PAC-1 (ARHGAP21 and ARHGAP23) and PICC-1 (CCDC85A, CCDC85B, and CCDC85C) homologues have not yet been determined, a mutation in mouse Ccdc85C is associated with hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. CCDC85C protein localizes to apical junctions in radial glia lining brain ventricles (Mori et al., 2012), raising the possibility that this birth defect results from improper regulation of AJ proteins or junctional actin during brain development.

CRISPR knockins. Plasmids for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to make par-6(xn60: par-6-zf1-yfp + unc-119) and cdc-42(xn65: zf1-yfp-cdc-42 + unc-119) were constructed as described previously (Dickinson et al., 2013), with the following modifications. For par-6, the guide RNA sequence from plasmid pDD122 was replaced with the sequences (5-GCACCGCAGCCGCTACAGG-3) and (5-GTC CACCTGTAGCGGCTGCGG-3) to create two single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that cleave near the par-6 C-terminus (plasmids pJA031 and pJA032). For cdc-42, the sequence (5-GCCGTCACAGTAATG ATCGG-3) was used in pDD122 to direct cleavage near the cdc-42 N-terminus (plasmid pJA037). Homologous repair plasmids for par-6 (pJA034) and cdc-42 (pJA036) were constructed using Gibson assembly. For par-6, the following DNA segments were assembled in order: 1517 bp upstream of par-6 stop codon (including six silent point mutations adjacent to the predicted sgRNA cut sites) as the left homology arm; zf1-yfp with unc-119; and the 3-terminal 1508 bp of par-6 genomic sequence as the right homology arm. For cdc-42, the repair plasmid contained the following DNA segments: the 5-terminal 1511 bp of cdc-42 genomic sequence as the left homology arm; zf1-yfp with unc-119; and 1502 bp downstream of the cdc-42 start codon as the right homology arm (including five silent point mutations adjacent to the predicted sgRNA cut sites), and was amplified from WS5018 strain genomic DNA to include 5 linker sequence (Neukomm et al., 2014). zf1-yfp with unc-119 flanked by LoxP sites was amplified from plasmid pJN601, which contains LoxP-flanked unc-119 inserted in reverse orientation into a synthetic intron within yfp (Armenti et al., 2014b). The vector backbone for each construct was PCR-amplified from pJN601 using Gibson assembly primers that overlapped with homology arms for par-6 or cdc-42.
par-6(xn60: par-6-zf1-yfp + unc-119) was generated by microinjecting the sgRNA plasmids pJA031 and pJA032 (which also contains Cas9), the homologous repair template pJA034, and plasmid coinjection markers pGH8 (rab-3P::mCherry::unc-54utr; plasmid 19359; Addgene), pCFJ104 (myo-3P::mCherry::unc-54utr; plasmid 19328; Addgene), pCFJ90 (myo-2P::mCherry::unc-54utr; plasmid 19327; Addgene), and pMA122 (peel-1 negative selection; plasmid 34873; Addgene) into unc-119(ed3) mutant worms

(Frøkjær-Jensen et al., 2012; Dickinson et al., 2013). Plates containing non-Unc F2 transformants were heat-shocked at 34°C for 4 h to activate PEEL-1 toxin in array-bearing animals, and successfully edited F2 non-Unc animals were confirmed by the absence of mCherry expression in the F2 generation and YFP expression in their progeny. cdc-42(xn65: zf1-yfp-cdc-42 + unc-119) was generated using the same procedure, but with cdc-42 sgRNA and repair construct. Both knockin alleles were functional, but caused a low level of lethality (par-6 [xn60], 88% [387/439] viable; cdc42[xn65], 85% [258/305] viable).

The following transgenes were injected into wild-type worms to produce extrachromosomal arrays (Mello et al., 1991): cdc42P::mCherry-ha-ha-pac-1 (10 ng/µl + 80 ng/µl pRF4); cdc42P:: mCherry-ha-ha-pac-1(R984A) (10 ng/µl + 80 ng/µl pRF4); lin-26P::haha-cdc-42(Q61L) (1 ng/µl + 90 ng/µl pRF4); and lin-26P::nls-gfp (1 ng/µl + 90 ng/µl pRF4). pRF4 contains the dominant rol-6(su1006) allele (Mello et al., 1991).

anti-RFP 1:1,000 (clone 5F8; http://antibodies-online.com). Primary antibodies were detected with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL Prime kit (Amersham).
RNAi For jac-1 RNAi, base pairs 1546 to 2640 corresponding to WormBase transcript Y105C5B.21b were cloned into vector pPD129.36 (Timmons and Fire, 1998). For hmp-1 RNAi, base pairs 2163 to 2856 of WormBase transcript R13H4.4a were cloned into vector pPD129.36. For pac-1 RNAi, base pairs 3706 to 4585 of Wormbase transcript C04D8.1a were used, corresponding to the C04D8.1 feeding library clone (Kamath and Ahringer, 2003). For picc-1 RNAi, 1.6 kb corresponding to the entire WormBase transcript F29G9.2a was cloned into pPD129.36. For cdc42 RNAi, the entire cdc-42 coding sequence (Wormbase R07G3.1 transcript) in vector pPD129.36 was used (Aceto et al., 2006).
RNAi constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain HT115, and experiments were performed using the feeding method (Timmons et al., 2001). L4 larvae were placed on RNAi plates seeded with bacterial cultures grown for 8-9 h at 37°C in selective media. Seeded plates were left at room temperature for 12-20 h for induction. Empty vector pPD129.36 was used as a negative control in all experiments. Worms were fed for 36-40 h at 25°C, and were either transferred to new RNAi plates to lay eggs (to assay embryonic lethality) or chopped for fixation and staining of embryos. For cdc-42 RNAi, embryos were examined after 30 h of feeding at 20°C.
Each RNAi experiment included a control with GFP- or mCherry-fused target protein to check for knockdown efficiency.
Determining embryonic lethality Seven to ten adult worms were placed on seeded plates and allowed to lay eggs for six hours at 23°C. Worms were subsequently removed, and eggs were counted. After 24 h, the number of unhatched eggs was counted. Experiments were performed in triplicate.
Immunostaining Embryos were placed in 7 µl water on poly-l-lysine-coated slides, freeze-cracked on dry ice, fixed in methanol and paraformaldehyde, and stained as described (Anderson et al., 2008). The following primary antibodies and dilutions were used: rabbit anti-HMR-1 1:10,000 (Klompstra et al., 2015), mouse anti-HMP-1 1:10 (Costa et al., 1998), mouse anti-PSD-95 (recognizes DLG-1) 1:200 (Affinity BioReagents), rabbit anti-GFP 1:1,000 (Ab6556.25; AbCam), rat antimCherry 1:100 (clone 5F8; http://antibodies-online.com), rabbit anti- PAR-6 1:20 (Schonegg and Hyman, 2006), mouse anti-HA 1:1,000 (clone 16B12; Covance), and rabbit anti-LET-413 1:5,000 (Aono et al., 2004). The following secondary antibodies were used: Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) 1:1,000 (Molecular Probes), Cy3 anti-rat 1:100 (Jackson ImmunoResearch), Cy3 anti-mouse IgG (subclasses 1+2a+2b+3) 1:250 (Jackson ImmunoResearch), Alexa Fluor 647 antimouse IgG (H+L) 1:100 (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and Alexa Fluor 647 anti-rabbit 1:200 (Molecular Probes).
Embryo mounting For live imaging, embryos were mounted on 4% agar pads. For scoring elongation phenotypes and rates, multiple two-cell embryos were mounted together, allowed to develop for 3 h at room temperature, and imaged simultaneously in the same field of view. cdc-42(MZ) embryos were imaged together with control embryos in the same field of view until control embryos hatched. For LifeAct-GFP near-TIRF imaging, embryos were mounted in 4 µl H2O containing 100-150 polystyrene beads (14.92 µm diameter; NT29N; Bangs Labs) to flatten the embryo surface.

Imaging DIC movies were acquired using an AxioImager (Zeiss), 63× 1.4 NA or 40× 1.3 NA objective, DIC optics, an Axiocam MRM camera, and AxioVision software. Timelapse images were acquired every 3 min for 7-9 h at 23°C, with six z-planes spaced at 2-µm intervals.
Fluorescence images for Fig. 3 (B and D), Fig. S1 (A-C), Fig. S2 (A-D), Fig. S4 A, and Fig. S5 E were acquired on an AxioImager with 63× 1.4 NA or 40× 1.3 NA objective and a camera (model C1060010B-H, S. 160522; Hamamatsu). Images were deconvolved using the constrained iterative method in AxioVision software. The sum of 7-10 z-sections taken at 0.3-µm intervals is shown. All other fluorescent images (except LifeAct-GFP) were acquired using an SP5 confocal microscope (Leica), 63× 1.4 NA oil-immersion objective for fixed samples, 63× 1.2 NA water-immersion lens for live imaging, 488-, 561-, 594-, or 633-nm laser, 4× zoom, and 0.7-µm z-interval. For intensity measurements, 1.5-fold live embryos were imaged using HyD detectors and the photon-counting mode.
LifeAct-GFP images were acquired on an inverted Eclipse-Ti microscope (Nikon) with TIRF illuminator and Perfect Focus, 488 nm laser, 100× 1.49 NA oil-immersion objective, iXon3 897 EMCC D camera (Andor) with a ET525/50M filter (Chroma Technology). Laser illumination angle and intensity were controlled by NIS-Elements Software (Nikon). For near-TIRF imaging (Robin et al., 2014), the laser illumination angle was the same for all experiments and was chosen to achieve the highest signal intensity with nearly even illumination. Images were magnified by 1.5× and taken at 32 frames/s.
Image analysis All measurements were performed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). For measuring elongation rates, the length of the eggshell was determined and used as a reference for onefold elongation. The zero time point for all measurements was at the bean stage.
For the intensity profile in Fig. 2 E, a line one pixel in width and 3 µm in length length was drawn perpendicular to the apical epidermal membrane as shown in Fig. 2 (A and B). The intensity of each pixel along the line was plotted using the Plot Profile ImageJ plug-in.
The apical membrane to cytoplasm intensity ratio in epidermal cells was measured in bean-stage embryos. A single focal plane image was selected from a z-stack. A line one pixel in width and 20 µm in length was drawn along the apical membrane, and a second line was drawn in the cytoplasm 2 µm below the apical membrane, as shown in Fig. 2 F. Mean pixel intensity values along each line were calculated using the ImageJ measuring tool. Each data point on the graph represents the ratio between the mean intensity value at the apical membrane divided by the mean intensity value in the cytoplasm measured for one embryo.
The junctional to lateral intensity ratio for HMR-1-GFP (Fig. 2 J) was measured by drawing a line along the lateral membrane and then dividing the intensity measured in the junctional area by the mean intensity along the lateral domain.
Pearson correlation coefficient colocalization tests were performed on deconvolved images using the JACoP plug-in in ImageJ.
The efficiency of degradation of YFP-ZF1-CDC-42 was quantified in the epidermis of 1.5-fold embryos. Photon counting mode on the Leica SP5 confocal was used for imaging. Embryos were selected using the freehand selection tool on an image produced by z-projection of two confocal z-sections. Background intensity was subtracted from the mean intensity value.
The intensity of AJ components at junctions was measured at the 1.5-fold stage. A z-projection of the sum of the three top z-sections was measured for each embryo. A duplicate of this image was used to create a mask, which was filtered with an FFT Bandpass filter (to filter out structures smaller than two pixels) and thresholded. The mask was then

used to select junctions on original nonprocessed image for measurement. The "Analyze Particles" plug-in was used to measure intensities.
The intensity of the CDC-42 biosensor at junctions was measured at the 1.5-fold stage by drawing a line across the junction and measuring the maximal intensity. For each embryo, four measurements were taken.
LifeAct-GFP images in Fig. 7 were obtained by averaging 200 frames and applying the Unsharp Mask filter (radius 1 pixel and mask weight 0.7). In Fig. 7 D, embryos at the same developmental stage (1.3fold elongation) and in the same orientation (lateral and ventral rows of cells up) were analyzed. In Fig. 7 E, embryos at 1.2- and 1.3-fold elongation were analyzed. An image stack of 512 time points was processed by running a mean of 16 frames to reduce noise, using linear contrast enhancement with no saturated pixels, and subtracting background. SD was calculated for each pixel through time and then divided by a mean intensity of this pixel to normalize. The output of this calculation was an image that was pseudo-colored as a heat map using LUT. To measure actin remodeling at the junctions, a segmented line 1 µm in width was drawn along the junction between two ventral cells (18 and 20, Worm Atlas) and their neighboring seam cells.
For plotting image quantification and statistical analysis, mean values for each embryo were copied to Prism 6.
Statistics Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 6. Statistical tests, number of embryos, and number of experiments are indicated in the figure legends. No statistical method was used to predetermine the sample size. The investigators were not blinded during experiments and outcome assessment.

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: If anxiety and depression do not detect in pregnant women, they may cause complications for the mother, child, and family, including postpartum depression. With regard to the administrative capability of relaxation in health centers, this study was conducted to determine the effect of progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery on stress, anxiety, and depression in pregnant women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on pregnant women in the city of Kashan at 28-36 weeks. At the onset of the study, demographic questionnaire, Edinburgh Depression Scale, and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale21 (DASS21) were completed. Providing obtaining score of mildtomoderate in the stress, anxiety, and depression scale and score of 10 or higher in Edinburgh Depression Scale, individuals were divided randomized to the intervention group (n = 33) and control group (n = 33). DASS21 was again completed in the 4th-7th weeks of beginning of the study by all women.
RESULTS: Analysis of variance with repeated measures indicated significant differences in mean of scores of stress, anxiety, and depression at three different times in relaxation group (P < 0.05) whereas found no significant differences in the mean of scores of stress, anxiety, and depression in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, relaxation could reduce stress, anxiety, and depression in pregnant women during six sessions. Due to the simplicity and low cost of this technique, it can be used to reduce stress and anxiety in pregnant women and improve pregnancy outcomes.

Introduction
Pregnancy for most women is a stressful experience because mothers must adapt to the new situation; for this reason, pregnancy is a time of increased vulnerability for the onset or relapse of a mental disorder.[1] Perinatal period is especially important as a maternal mood, and stress and anxiety problems are associated with

adverse outcomes in pregnancy including parenting, disturbance in behavioral regulation, and unsafe attachment in children.[2] Around the world, around 10% of women during pregnancy and 13% of women after childbirth experience mental disorders, especially depression.[3] The past studies showed that a significant portion of pregnant women experience prenatal anxiety.[4] Mohammad Yusuff et al. reported that women experiencing anxiety during

pregnancy are at a threefold risk of being depressed compared to women without anxiety.[5]
Depression in pregnancy is a major threat to the health of the mother and has serious implications for the mother and the fetus so should be identified and treated. Mild and moderate depression identified by screening tools can be assessed and treated in the primary care.[6,7] For mildtomoderate depression, nondrug therapies should be used. The small numbers of therapists are available to provide this treatment, as against the high prevalence of depressive disorder, is a limiting factor. Primary care centers do not provide more than 30min sessions, and usually, these centers do not employ people with mental health skills. There is a big gap between the proposed intervention and what people actually get there, so trying to find new and simpler solution is necessary to create beneficial effects and fewer side effects for the mother and infant. Regarding the timeconsuming and costly of psychotherapy methods in the treatment of anxiety and depression, simpler procedures should be considered such as complementary medicine in the treatment of depression.
Recently, complementary medicine has been widely used in the prevention of disease and in health promotion.[8] Three common approaches of complementary medicine in the treatment of depression are relaxation, exercise, and plant therapy. Relaxation techniques such as methods of coping with stress, anxiety, and depression are simple psychotherapeutic methods and can be performed after brief training.[9,10] Jacobson progressive muscle relaxation is common. This technique is very easy to learn and serves as one of the best complementary therapies due to ease of learning and costsavings and because it does not require special equipment, allowing easy implementation.[11,12]
A study of Rafiee et al. showed that in pregnant women with rate of low and intermediate anxiety, both methods reduce the anxiety score, but there was no difference between the two methods.[13] Malekzadegan et al. stated that progressive muscle relaxation increases the calmness of pregnant women. Increased levels of relaxation were caused decreased stress and adjustment of mental distress in individuals.[14]
Chambers' study found that the effect of progressive muscle relaxation in reducing the negative mood in pregnant women with stress is not more than selfcare. In fact, there was no change in the mood of pregnant women with stress by relaxation over time.[15] The study of Ahmadi Nejad et al. showed that depression, anxiety, and stress of the pregnant women were significantly lower in the progressive muscle relaxation group than those of the control group.[16]

The firstline treatment for postpartum depression is drug therapy with interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitivebehavioral therapy run by experts, while there are more simple methods that could be used with brief training by health professionals, including relaxation training. Relaxation techniques are complementary and noticed in the treatment of mood disorders due to control of selfcare and have less side effects than other interventions. According to the contradiction of the results of the previous studies about the effects of this method on mental disorders, we decided to perform the study with the aim of measuring the effect of progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery on stress, anxiety, and depression in pregnant women referred to health centers.
Materials and Methods
This study is a randomized clinical trial of pregnant women with the gestational age of 28-36 weeks in the health centers from September 2013 to November 2014. This protocol complies with the guidelines of Declarations of Helsinki and Tokyo, for humans and approved by ethics committee of the University of Medical Science. The researcher has been trained by a Master of Clinical Psychology in performing relaxation techniques. Cluster sampling was used to determine the health centers in Kashan. Five centers were selected. After explaining the purpose of the study by the researcher, the women provided informed consent form. Sociodemographic questionnaires were completed through interviews. The inclusion criteria were literate women, 18-35 years old, singleton pregnancy, gestational age 28-36 weeks, and body mass index between 19.8 and 29 of the first trimester, and the exclusion criteria were smoker, drugs and alcohol abuse, medication or hospitalization due to mental health problems, abortion more than twice, infertility, pregnancy complications, pain, or bleeding.
At first, the Edinburgh Depression Scale and Scale of Stress, Anxiety, and Depression (DASS21) were completed by pregnant women. Women who scored 15-25 on stress or 8-14 on anxiety or 10-20 on depression and scored 10 or above on Edinburgh Depression Scale were randomly assigned into two groups: relaxation and control. Interventions in the relaxation group were performed for 6 weeks. In the relaxation group, the first two sessions of relaxation were performed in the health center. In the first session of relaxation training, the causes of postpartum depression and the ways of controlling it were discussed, and the relaxation purposes were explained. Furthermore, women were trained about how to contract and relax their 16 groups of muscles. Then, the practice was repeated once in the presence of a researcher by a training mother.

In the second session, progressive muscle relaxation technique was performed once again by a mother in the presence of the researcher, and after correction and ensuring the accuracy of the technique, a CD of progressive muscle relaxation was given to the women to perform the exercise daily at home. In the next four sessions, in addition to the exercises of relaxation performed at home, imagery techniques were performed by a researcher. The relaxation exercise was performed by the women at home for about 20 min daily.
In the control group, based on the manual of national safe motherhood, care of pregnancy was routine. DASS21 again was completed by the mothers in the 4th week of study and 7 weeks after beginning of the study in two groups: control and relaxation.
After collecting and coding data, data were entered into SPSS version 16 and statistical analysis was performed. Using paired ttest, the changes in each group were compared to the base. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures (repeated measurement) was used for the study of the effect of time and group therapy on stress, anxiety, and depression. By Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the normality of quantitative variables was determined. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
The findings showed there were no significant statistical differences in variables of demographics and perinatal situation, including age, education, job, income, parity and type, spousal support, and preconception counseling between the relaxation and control groups [Table 1]. ttest results indicated that the two groups in the social support (P = 0.869) and Edinburgh Depression Scale score (P = 0.812) were similar at baseline.

Paired ttest showed that scores of stress, anxiety, and depression in pregnant women before and after the intervention in the relaxation group had a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). Means of scores for stress, anxiety, and depression after relaxation exercises for pregnant women showed a significant decline. Paired ttest results showed that stress (P = 0.874), anxiety (P = 0.609), and depression (P = 0.053) scores had no significant difference at the beginning and end of the study in the control group.
Independent ttest results did not show a significant difference in the mean of stress score (P = 0.056) and anxiety score (P = 0.093) between the two groups at baseline. The mean score of stress significantly decreased in the relaxation group in the 4th week and at the end of the treatment, while the mean of score of

stress had no significant change in the control group at three time points before and after the study and in the 4th week of the study. ANOVA with repeated measures showed that measuring stress score at three different times are significantly different (P = 0.004). In other words, over time, stress scores in the two groups had changed (P = 0.002). These results show the effectiveness of relaxation to reduce stress in pregnant women from 4th to 7th weeks [Table 2].
The mean of anxiety scores in the 4th week of relaxation and after the end of the treatment significantly decreased, while the mean score of anxiety had no significant change in the control group before and end of the study and the 4th week of the study. ANOVA with repeated measures showed that there is no significant difference in the measure of anxiety scores at three different

times (P = 0.236). In other words, over time, anxiety scores in the two groups had no significant change.
The Mann-Whitney test showed no significant difference in mean of depression scores between the two groups at baseline (P = 0.857). The mean of depression score significantly decreased in the 4th week and after the end of treatment in the relaxation group, while the mean of depression scores in the control group at three time points before and after and the 4th week of the study had no significant change. ANOVA with repeated measures showed that measuring depression score had significant differences with each other at three different times (P = 0.045). In other words, over time, depression scores in the two groups changed. These results show that the effectiveness of relaxation for reducing depression is maintained in pregnant women during 7 weeks.
Discussion
The results showed that the stress, anxiety, and depression in pregnant women at 4 and 7 weeks through exercises of progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery can be reduced. Furthermore, the findings showed that the mean of scores of stress, anxiety and depression before and after the intervention had significant differences in the relaxation group, whereas in the control group, the mean scores of stress, anxiety, and depression showed no significant difference beginning and end of the study. Mean of scores reduced for stress, anxiety, and depression in the relaxation group was respectively, 31.9, 24.5, and 54.3%; while in the control group, not only did scores of stress, anxiety, and depression not decrease but also scores increased compared with baseline.

control) was performed for 4 weeks (once a week). At the end of the study, there were significant differences between anxiety scores in the intervention group and the control group.[17] The results of the present study are consistent with the Akbarzadeh study. In the current study, relaxation exercises were performed on a daily basis for 6 weeks at home, and guided imagery sessions were held at the health center, once a week; while in the Akbarzadeh study, exercises were performed only once a week for 4 weeks. The tool used in the Akbarzadeh study was a Spielberger Anxiety Inventory questionnaire and this study was used DASS21.
A study of Chambers showed that relaxation training and selfcare act similarly in reducing the negative mood in women with high stress in gestational age of 14-28 weeks. Perhaps, due to training of women how to deal with stress and to overcome the difficulties, the stress and anxiety scores reduced in a selfcare approach.[15] In this study, only routine care was performed in the control group, so, fear, stress, and disturbing thoughts increased stress and anxiety and even depression in the control group. In addition, in Chambers' study, women were in the second trimester of pregnancy, which is usually a safe trimester, while they were included in the current study in the third trimester of pregnancy. Due to the approach to birth time, the stress and anxiety of pregnant women increase, which is evident in the control group.
Nasiri compared two methods of problemsolving and relaxation on the severity of depressive symptoms of postpartum period. They found that both methods can reduce the scores of depression in the postpartum period although problemsolving was more effective than relaxation. Furthermore, the symptoms of depression reduced in the control group. Researchers reported that the reason for the decline of symptoms in women was a weekly visit to health centers.[18] Any intervention that had aspects of support and advice and attention by the midwife can reduce the incidence of anxiety and depression in women. In this study, midwives focused on physical complaints such as nausea and vomiting, and so, women have less psychological support, for this reason, concerns of women doubles. In the Nasiri's study, the reduction in depression scores of women in the postpartum period was 76.9% in the relaxation group, while in the current study in pregnancy, depressive symptoms were reduced by relaxation by 54.3%. Perhaps, various stressors during pregnancy caused relaxation less able to reduce depression.

Akbarzadeh et al. (2013) in Shiraz studied the effect of relaxation and attachment behavior training on anxiety in nulliparous women. The study of three groups (relaxation, training of attachment behaviors, and

With regard to the relationship between stress, anxiety, and depression, it can be said that the more stress is reduced; anxiety and depression are expected to decrease in the same proportion. As the results show, the mean of

stress score reduces only 31.9% in the relaxation group. Smith et al. compared the effects of yoga and relaxation to reduce stress and anxiety and concluded that both yoga and relaxation can reduce stress and anxiety in people. However, the two groups showed no significant difference in the levels of stress and anxiety after the treatment. The study was done in patients with mild to moderate levels of stress in South Australia. The intervention lasted 10 weeks.[19] Although the present study was conducted for 6 weeks of relaxation, the results showed the effectiveness of relaxation on stress, anxiety, and depression. The findings also showed that the stress, anxiety, and depression significantly decreased in the relaxation group compared to the control group during the 6 weeks. Despite the decrease in anxiety scores in the relaxation group, in the 4th week, the process of change in anxiety scores was not significant at the time. Women participating in the study were in the third trimester. Perhaps, because of the approaching birth time, concerns about the unborn child, what happens during labor or after delivery, women's anxiety increases and disturbing thoughts do not allow the mother to optimally perform relaxation exercises.[20,21] It also has been shown the increasing of the number of training sessions for relaxation to 12 sessions increases the effectiveness of this method. Therefore, it is recommended that if relaxation is implemented for pregnant women, preferably it should continue until the delivery and postpartum period.
The Urech et al.'s study found that both guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation can reduce heart rate, but guided visualization alone was significantly more effective for raising the comfort levels among pregnant women. In this study, it was found that a variety of relaxation techniques can have different effects on biological systems and psychological stress of individuals.[22] In the current study, the positive effects of two methods of progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery were combined in raising the comfort level.
Limitations The limitations of this study were that it evaluated the effect of relaxation within a short period (6 weeks) because pregnant women during childbirth suffer more than other times from anxiety and stress, it is suggested that future studies be done over a longer time until birth. The possible effect of individual differences in research on depression, anxiety, and stress was another limitation. The attempt was made for controlling the issue by randomly assigning research units to groups.
Conclusions
The results of this study indicate that relaxation reduces stress, anxiety, and depression in pregnant women,

and due to the ease of implementation of this method in health centers and at home, it could be part of the training in routine care during pregnancy that women can improve their performance by this method against environmental stressors.

Objective : The loosening of pedicle screws (PS) is one of the frequent problems of spinal surgery in the patients with osteoporosis. Previous studies had revealed that intermittent injection of teriparatide could reduce PS loosening by improving bone mass and quality when their patients took parathyroid hormone for a considerable duration before surgery. However, although the teriparatide is usually used after spine surgery in most clinical situations, there was no report on the efficacy of teriparatide treatment started after spine surgery. The purpose of this retrospective study was to examine the efficacy of teriparatide treatment started immediately after lumbar spinal surgery to prevent pedicle screw loosening in patients with osteoporosis. Methods : We included 84 patients with osteoporosis and degenerative lumbar disease who underwent transforaminal interbody fusion and PS fixation and received parathyroid hormone or bisphosphonate (BP) postoperatively. They were divided into teriparatide group (daily injection of 20 g of teriparatide for 6 months, 33 patients, 172 screws) and BP group (weekly oral administration of 35 mg of risedronate, 51 patients, 262 screws). Both groups received calcium (500 mg/day) and cholecalciferol (1000 IU/day) together. The screw loosening was evaluated with simple radiographic exams at 6 and 12 months after the surgery. We counted the number of patients with PS loosening and the number of loosened PS, and compared them between the two groups. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) preoperatively, and at 12 months after surgery. Results : There was no significant difference in the age, sex, diabetes, smoking, bone mineral density, body mass index, and the number of fusion levels between the two groups. The number of PS loosening within 6 months after surgery did not show a significant difference between the teriparatide group (6.9%, 12/172) and the BP group (6.8%, 18/272). However, during 6-12 months after surgery, it was significantly lower in the teriparatide group (2.3%, 4/172) than the BP group (9.2%, 24/272) (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in the number of patients showing PS loosening between the teriparatide and BP groups. The teriparatide group showed a significantly higher degree of improvement of the bone mineral density (T-score) than that of BP group (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in the pre- and post-operative VAS and ODI between the groups. Conclusion : Our data suggest that the teriparatide treatment starting immediately after lumbar spinal fusion surgery could reduce PS loosening compared to BP.

Effect of Teriparatide on Screw Loosening | Kim JW, et al.

INTRODUCTION
Aging population has led to a subsequent rise in the prevalence of spinal fusion for degenerative spinal diseases in elderly patients with severe osteoporosis5,21). According to the Korea Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, Korea officially became an aging society with the elderly population (>65 years) rising from 9.88% in 2007 to 12.57% in 2014. The number of spinal surgery cases during the same period grew by about 30%, and 77.1% of the patients who received a spinal surgery were older than 50 years.
Patients with osteoporosis are often associated with reduced pullout strength and insertional torque, which are known to be related with pedicle screw (PS) loosening14,21,36,37). However, despite the osteoporosis is well recognized as a highly important risk factor for PS loosening and considerable efforts are being made to overcome the problem, spinal fusion surgery remains a challenge in the elderly patients with osteoporosis16,35).
Several methods have been developed to enhance PS stability during spinal fusion surgery in patients with low bone quality. Expandable pedicle screws have not only significantly increased pullout strength compared to conventional pedicle screws, but also significantly reduced PS loosening resulting in better clinical outcome6,25,45). Further, PS augmentation using polymethylmethacrylate has been reported to increase the pullout strength of PS11,28), reduce PS loosening, increase fusion rate, and improve clinical outcome in patients with osteoporosis41). Use of cortical screws for lumbar spine or tricortical PS insertion at the S1 level is also used to increase pullout strength12,26,43).
Treating osteoporosis may increase PS stability by improving bone quality16,34,42). The two most representative medications for osteoporosis are bisphosphonate (BP) and parathyroid hormone (PTH)16,23). BP is an anti-resorptive drug that acts as an osteoclast inhibitor10). On the other hand, PTH is involved in a different mechanism increasing bone formation by stimulating osteoblastic activity22). Compared to BP, PTH is known to more effectively increase bone strength and bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and to have a better fusion rate1,20,22,32). Particularly, several studies have reported that teriparatide injection for 2 months before surgery led to higher fusion rate and reduced PS loosening than the patients group receiving BP orally, which showed the usefulness

of teriparatide in spinal fusion surgery for osteoporotic patients33,34). Based on our experience, however, using teriparatide for several months prior to surgery was quite difficult in most cases. Nevertheless, there has not been a study examining whether the use of teriparatide starting with surgery can prevent PS loosening. Hence, we planned to investigate the effects of teriparatide starting with lumbar fusion surgery on the occurrence of PS loosening in the osteoporotic patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient
A total of 345 patients underwent transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) for the degenerative lumbar diseases at our hospital between March 2012 and December 2015. We excluded 179 patients without osteoporosis, 59 patients who have been using teriparatide or BP previously for known osteoporosis, and 23 patients with spinal tumor, infection, or acute vertebral fractures. Finally, 84 patients were enrolled in the study. The BMD in the lumbar spine and femur neck was checked preoperatively and at one year after surgery using the Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (GE Lunar, Madison, WI, USA). And T-score lower than -2.5 at any one site were diagnosed with osteoporosis15,19). Teriparatide was first recommended in patients with osteoporosis. Patients who refused to take teriparatide were advised to use BP. The patients were divided into teriparatide group (n=33) and BP group (n=51) based on postoperative administration of teriparatide or BP.
Surgery
All patients underwent TLIF using single capstone cage (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) filled with autologous bone chips obtained from laminectomy and facetectomy. Two surgeons performed the surgeries using the same surgical procedures. The patients were instructed to wear a lumbar support brace for 3 months after surgery.
Administration of teriparatide and BP
The teriparatide group (n=33) received subcutaneous injection of teriparatide (20 µg; Forsteo, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, USA) every day for 6 months starting immediately after surgery, after 6 months of teriparatide administration, the drug

was changed to risedronate (35 mg; Actonel, Sanofi-Aventis Korea, Seoul, Korea). The BP group (n=51) took risedronate orally (35 mg; Actonel) once every week immediately after surgery for 12 months. All the patients in both groups orally took calcium (500 mg/day) and cholecalciferol (1000 IU/day; Dicamax D, Dalim Biotech, Seoul, Korea) once every day immediately after surgery.
Radiographical and clinical evaluation
To assess PS loosening, simple radiography was performed every month following surgery, and the incidences of PS loosening in the two groups were compared at 6 and 12 months

after surgery. PS loosening was defined as the presence of at least 1 mm halo sign with radiolucent line surrounding the screw7,34,40). Two neurosurgeons performed radiological assessments, and PS loosening was diagnosed upon agreement by both surgeons. To compare the postoperative clinical outcomes, the visual analog scale (VAS; 0=no pain, 10=worst pain) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were measured preoperatively and at 12 months postoperatively.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows version 20 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The independent t-test, chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test were performed with significance level set at p<0.05.

RESULTS
The mean ages of the teriparatide and BP groups were 69.45± 7.76 and 66.75±6.46 years, and male to female ratios were 8 : 25 and 12 : 39, respectively (p>0.05). The two groups did not significantly different in the presence of diabetes, smoking history, and body mass index (p>0.05). The number of patients undergoing 1, 2, and 3-level fusion were 16, 14, and three in the teriparatide group, and 27, 19, and five in the BP group. There were no significant differences in the extent of the operation between the two groups (p>0.05). Preoperative BMD (T-score) in the teriparatide and BP groups were -3.09±0.49 and -2.94± 0.39, and BMD (T-score) at 12 months after surgery were -2.61 ±0.55 and -2.68±0.44, respectively, showing no significant differences between the two groups (p>0.05, Table 1). There was a significant improvement in the BMD (T-score) at 12 months compared to those of the preoperative BMD (T-score) in both groups (p<0.05). The teriparatide group showed a significantly higher degree of improvement in the BMD (T-score) after 12 months (14.86±14.97%) than that of the BP group (8.55± 11.43%) (p<0.05, Table 1). However, the two groups did not show a significant difference in the preoperative and postoperative VAS and ODI (p>0.05, Table 2).
There were no significant differences in the number of patients showing PS loosening at 6 months after surgery between the teriparatide group (12%, 4/33) and BP group (13%, 7/51) (p>0.05). At 12 months after surgery, the number of patients with PS loosening was lower in the teriparatide group (18%, 6/33) than the BP group (25%, 13/51), but there was no statistical significance. Between 6 and 12 months after surgery the number of patients showing PS loosening was also lower in the teriparatide group (6%, 2/33) than the BP group (12%, 6/51), but not to a statistically significant degree (p>0.05, Table 3). The number of loosened PS at 6 months after surgery was 6.9% (12/172) in the teriparatide group and 6.8% (18/262) in the BP group without significant difference. However, the number of loosened PS at 12 months after surgery was significantly lower in the teriparatide group (9.3%, 16/172) than in the BP group (16.1%, 42/262) (p<0.05). The significant difference in the incidence of PS loosening at 12 months after surgery is thought to be related to the fact that markedly fewer cases of PS loosening occurred in the teriparatide group (2.3%, 4/172) than in the BP group (9.2%, 24/262) between 6 and 12 months after surgery (p<0.05, Table 3). The mean peri-

od of onset of PS loosening was 5.1±3.1 months after surgery in the teriparatide group and 7.5±3.2 months after surgery in the BP group (p<0.05). The significantly shorter period for PS loosening occurrence in the teriparatide group also seems to be related to the markedly decreased number of newly developed PS loosening between 6 and 12 months after surgery.
Among teriparatide group, the BMD (T-score) and its degree of improvement after 12 months in the patients without PS loosening were significantly higher (-2.51±0.51 and 17.42± 14.42%) comparing to those in the patients with PS loosening (-3.08±0.47 and 3.35±12.52%) (p<0.05, Table 4). The patients

without PS loosening in the BP group also showed a significantly higher degree of improvement of BMD (T-score), not the BMD (T-score) itself, after 12 months (10.44±11.63%) comparing to the patients with PS loosening (3.02±9.10%) (p<0.05, Table 5).
DISCUSSION
Since its approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2002, teriparatide has been used in patients with osteoporosis to reduce fragility and improve BMD by increasing bone mass29,31). Further, in contrast to BP which efficacy in improving spinal fusion rate and reducing PS loosening is still debated, intermittent use of teriparatide has been verified in several animal studies and clinical trials to increase

fusion rates1,22,32,33). Moreover, in a study on postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis who underwent posterolateral spinal fusion, the incidence of PS loosening was significantly lower in the teriparatide group (7-13%) than in the BP group (13-26%)34). It was also true in this study; the patients who were administered teriparatide for 6 months immediately following surgery showed a significantly lower incidence of PS loosening than that of the BP group. Intermittent use of teriparatide not only increases bone mass in cortical and cancellous bones by stimulating bone formation but also improves bone quality by increasing the volume and connectivity of cancellous bone8,18). teriparatide administration initiates stimulation of bone formation after one month and starts to show BMD improvement after 3 months2,17,27,39). Furthermore, after 6 months of teriparatide administration, bone microstructure shows improvement with increased bone volume fraction and

trabecular number, and risk of fracture begins to decline in patients with osteoporosis13,17,39). In this study, the markedly lower PS loosening between 6 to 12 months after surgery in the teriparatide group compared to that in the BP group is speculated to be related to the temporal outcomes of such pharmacological effects of teriparatide.
Loosening of PS is a delayed postoperative complication that is prevalent among elderly patients with low bone density, which may combine with pseudoarthrosis with instrument failure, adjacent level degeneration, and progressive kyphosis9). In our study, the mean period of PS loosening onset was 5.1± 3.1 months post-operatively in the teriparatide group and 7.5± 3.2 months post-operatively in the BP group. The delayed onset in the BP group is a result of a higher incidence of PS loosening after 6 months of surgery in the BP group compared to the teriparatide group. Several studies have revealed that patients begin to show improvement in BMD and bone microstructure and have reduced risk for fracture after 6 months of teriparatide administration13,17,39). In our study, the teriparatide group showed reduced PS loosening incidence after 6 months of the administration, which is comparable with the results of previous studies that stated it took more than 6 months for any visible effects of teriparatide on bone quality to show.
Multiple studies that explored the effects of BP on spinal fusion suggested that BP increases fusion rate4,24,30), but whether BP reduces PS loosening is still a subject of considerable debate34,42). According to the literature, BP begins to inhibit bone resorption after one month of use and begins to increase BMD after 3-6 months of use. Further, a state of reduced bone turnover is reached after 6 months of BP administration and is maintained until 12 months27). Considering these findings, if BP has any prophylactic effect on PS loosening, the incidence of PS loosening should decline between 6-12 months than the first 6 months of BP use. However, our data showed no significant decrease in the number of patients with PS loosening or the number of loosened PS between the two periods, first 6 months and 6-12 months after surgery. However, we could not confirm such effects of BP as we did not investigate patients who have not received treatment for osteoporosis.
In the papers reporting the efficacy of teriparatide in lumbar spinal fusion, teriparatide administration was initiated 1-2 months before surgery to improve bone density16,34). However, most patients who underwent surgery had not been diagnosed with or treated for osteoporosis before surgery, and surgery

could not be delayed due to severe pain. Further, delaying surgery in the presence of severe pain due to degenerative lumbar spine diseases might have resulted in poor results after surgery38). Hence, this study compared patients who were administered teriparatide immediately after surgery to those who used BP immediately after surgery as treatment for osteoporosis among patients who were scheduled to undergo lumbar spinal fusion. Although the therapeutic effects begin to show after 6 months of treatment, we could observe the positive effect of teriparatide reducing PS loosening and more aggressive use of teriparatide would be conducive to better outcome even though osteoporosis was found immediately before surgery.
The teriparatide group showed a significantly higher degree of improvement in the BMD (T-score) than the BP group. However, there was no significant difference in the BMD (Tscore) at 12 months between the two groups. It seemed to be due to the lower, though not significant, preoperative BMD (T-score) in the teriparatide group (-3.09±0.49) than in the BP group (-2.94±0.39). We think the reason may be that doctors preferred to use teriparatide in the patients with lower BMD (T-score) rather than BP, and the compliance for the use of teriparatide was also better in the patients with more severe osteoporosis. The patients without PS loosening showed a significantly higher degree of improvement of BMD (T-score) at 12 months comparing to the patients with PS loosening in both groups. Those results suggested that the patients with a better response to anti-osteoporosis medications showed a tendency of a lower incidence of PS loosening.
Teriparatide has been documented to reduce lower back pain in patients with osteoporosis17,39), but there was no difference in VAS or ODI between the teriparatide and BP groups in our study. These results seemed to be mainly due to the lumbar fusion surgery itself already resolved lesions like spinal stenosis or instability causing the pain. In addition, there was no significant difference in VAS or ODI according to the presence of PS loosening in both groups. Although PS loosening may increase lower back pain, previous studies suggested that PS loosening itself not be a determinant of clinical outcomes34,44). However, the PS loosening may exacerbate clinical symptoms or induce pseudoarthrosis in the future, contributing to poor prognosis in the long-term period3,35,45). Whereas the two groups showed a clear difference in the number of loosened PS, the number of patients with PS loosening was not different significantly between the two groups. The small

sample size and relatively short follow-up period are thought to have contributed to such results.
Our study has limitations of a retrospective study on a relatively small sample size, and we did not compare the data regarding the fusion level. We also did not compare the data with that of a control group who did not receive any treatment for osteoporosis. However, it is practically impossible to set up a control group who has not received any treatment for osteoporosis because osteoporosis drugs are already widely used in the patients with osteoporosis, and any patients diagnosed with osteoporosis should take medications for osteoporosis immediately. Regarding the selection of medication for osteoporosis, we recommended the use of teriparatide first. However, we began the treatment with BP in the patients who refused the use of teriparatide. High price and inconvenience of teriparatide injection seemed to make the patients refuse the teriparatide administration for a long time. Although we got a positive result with 6-month teriparatide reducing PS loosening, teriparatide more than 6 months must be more efficient. Considering that the gap in the incidence of PS loosening between the two groups increased over time, a longer follow-up must be needed.
CONCLUSION
The use of teriparatide for 6 months starting immediately after lumbar fusion operation seems to reduce PS loosening in the osteoporotic patients. Such preventive effect of teriparatide was apparent after 6 months of administration. We would recommend more active consideration of using teriparatide in the osteoporotic patients planning to receive lumbar fusion surgery.

ABSTRACT
Total body irradiation (TBI) is a special radiotherapy technique, administered prior to bone marrow transplantation. Due to the complex nature of the treatment setup, in vivo dosimetry for TBI is mandatory to ensure proper delivery of the intended radiation dose throughout the body. Lithium fluoride (LiF) TLD-100 chips are used for the TBI in vivo dosimetry. Results obtained from the in vivo dosimetry of 20 patients are analyzed. Results obtained from forehead, abdomen, pelvis, and mediastinum showed a similar pattern with the average measured dose from 96 to 97% of the prescription dose. Extremities and chest received a dose greater than the prescription dose in many instances (more than 20% of measurements). Homogeneous dose delivery to the whole body is checked by calculating the mean dose with standard deviation for each fraction. Reasons for the difference between prescription dose and measured dose for each site are discussed. Dose homogeneity within ±10% is achieved using our in-house TBI protocol.
Key words: In vivo dosimetry, lithium fluoride, total body irradiation, TLD-100

Introduction
Total body irradiation (TBI) is a radiotherapy technique mostly used as a part of the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The role of TBI in conjunction with chemotherapeutic agents is to destroy malignant or genetically disordered cells and to immunosuppress the patient prior to HSCT. The immune system of the patients has to be suppressed prior to HSCT, which otherwise could reject the donor cells. Among the various modalities of patient preparation prior to bone marrow transplantation,

TBI is advantageous compared to other methods for achieving a homogeneous dose delivery and for boosting or shielding the dose to any specific sites if required.
TBI is a complex treatment procedure and differs from routine radiotherapy treatment techniques' inpatient setup, treatment distance, and field size. Hence, it is mandatory to monitor the accurate delivery of the prescribed dose during TBI through in vivo dosimetry checks.[1,2] Dosimetry for TBI is generally performed using silicon diodes or thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs).[3-6] Accurate results can be obtained with lithium fluoride (LiF) TLD chips as their dependence on dose rate, direction, energy of the radiation beam, and temperature is less significant compared to the other available dosimeters like ionization chamber and semiconductor devices.[6] It is recommended to analyze the in vivo dosimetry results carried out on a number of patients to check the efficiency of the technique being used.[7] Though there have been a number of publications available on TBI in vivo dosimetry, the treatment technique used was not entirely similar among these studies. Most of the studies have used bilateral treatment fields with the patient lying in the supine position. Published results available on TBI in vivo dosimetry in the technique using Anterior to Posterior and Posterior to Anterior (AP-PA) treatment fields with the patient lying on the lateral decubitus position are rare. The

objective of this study is to report and analyze the results of our in vivo dosimetry checks measured with TLD chips on TBI using AP-PA treatment fields.

around the world. The choice of a technique in a particular hospital depends on many factors like available equipment, photon beam energy, maximum possible field size, patient dimension, and treatment distance. Specific treatment parameters to be determined include field size, collimator angle, treatment distance, dose per fraction, dose rate, total dose, number of fractions per day, interval between fractions, beam energy, geometry to achieve dose homogeneity, bolus or beam spoilers to increase skin dose, shielding, and dose compensation requirements (e.g., lungs, kidneys). In our hospital, AP-PA technique with 6 MV photon beam from linear accelerator (linac), Oncor Expression (Ms. Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) was used for TBI. Vacuum cushion was used to keep the patient immobilized in the treatment position during treatment execution. Patient was made to lie on one side in the vacuum cushion at a source to surface distance (SSD) of 400 cm. Collimator jaws were opened to a maximum field size of 40 × 40 cm2, with the collimator rotated to 45° so as to fully cover the patient body. Patients were asked to keep both arms across the chest and their fist over lung region of the chest to compensate for the tissue inhomogeneity in the lung. No separate blocks were used to shield lung, as it was difficult to introduce and match the blocks over lungs in the TBI technique with the patient lying on lateral decubitus position. A beam spoiler made of polymethylmethaacrylate (PMMA) of thickness 2 cm was introduced between the patient and the machine at a distance of around 50 cm from the patient surface to avoid the skin-sparing effect. Total prescribed dose of 12 Gy (150 cGy per fraction) was delivered to the patients over eight fractions of treatment in 4 days. Each day, two fractions of treatment were given with a gap of minimum 6 h. Treatment was delivered at a dose rate of 6 cGy/min at the treatment distance by setting 100 monitor units (MU)/min in linac. Number of MUs required to deliver the per field prescription dose of 75 cGy was in the range of 1300-1400 MUs depending on the average thickness of the patient.
During patient preparation, anterior posterior (A-P) thickness was measured at forehead, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, thigh, knee, and ankle to calculate the average thickness of the patient. Dose was prescribed to the midplane depth of this calculated average thickness. Test dose of 20 cGy (10 cGy from anterior field and 10 cGy from posterior field) was delivered to the patients prior to treatment for dosimetric verification. TLD chips are the standard detector used for patient in vivo dosimetry

in our TBI treatments. In vivo dosimetry was carried out by pasting TLD chips at multiple sites throughout the patient body to measure the dose received. After ensuring acceptable dose results from the test dose measurements, patients were taken up for further treatment.
Percentage depth dose and output measurement Radiation output and depth dose profiles of the
linac measured at the TBI setup were used for the MU calculation. Percentage depth dose (PDD) values measured for standard 100 cm SSD and converted for 400 cm SSD using the Mayneord factor differ from the actual PDD for TBI setup, as the difference in SSD is very large. Hence, it is recommended that a direct measurement of the PDD and output should be obtained at the TBI setup. RFA300 radiation field analyzer (Scanditronix Wellhofer, Uppsala, Sweden) having mylar window on one wall was used to measure the PDD at the TBI setup. High-doped p-type silicon diodes (Hi-p Si) were used as the detectors. The reference detector was also kept beyond the beam spoiler (close to the phantom) in the same spectrum of beam energy. Accuracy of PDD data measured using diode was verified using gafchromic films at multiple depths (absolute measurement). PDD values generated using Mayneord factor for 400 cm SSD at every 5 mm were compared with the PDD values measured for TBI setup [Figure 1]. Difference between the two PDD curves was more significant at larger depths. Also, it was observed that for the PDD measured at TBI, the depth of dose maximum (dmax) had shifted to 4 mm depth compared to 15 mm depth for the PDD generated using Mayneord factor. Based on these observations, the bolus material to keep the TLD during in vivo dosimetry was made of 5 mm thickness to achieve buildup.
Output measurement of the linac at the TBI distance was measured using solid water slabs (density: 1.03 g/cc) of dimensions 30 cm × 30 cm. Multiple solid water slabs were used to make a phantom of 20 cm thickness. A 0.6 cc cylindrical ionization chamber (PTW, Freiburg, Germany)

with UNIDOS E electrometer was used for measurements. Care was taken to reduce the direct exposure to dosimetry cable to minimize the leakage. The ionization chamber was kept at a depth of 10 cm and irradiated with 500 MU. The meter reading obtained was used to calculate the radiation output using the PDD value obtained at 10 cm depth for TBI setup. IAEA TRS-398 formalism for output measurement of high-energy photon beams was used to calculate the output taking into account the ion recombination, polarity correction, and temperature and pressure correction.
Calibration procedure of the TLD Two sets of LiF TLD-100 chips (Harshaw, Solon, OH,
USA) of dimension 3.2 mm × 3.2 mm × 1 mm were used in this study. TLD chips were annealed at 400°C for 1 h using Fisher Scientific thermal furnace, followed by gradual cooling at room temperature. A semi-automatic TLD reader (Harshaw 3500) was used to read the response from the TLDs. Prior to start using the TLD chips for dosimetry, both sets of TLD chips were calibrated in order to establish dose as a function of TLD reading. Each TLD chip was allotted an identification name in the reader. All the TLDs were then annealed and irradiated with 6 MV photon at 5 cm depth in solid water phantom (density: 1.03 g/cc) with a 10 cm × 10 cm jaw opening in the linac at 100 cm SSD to a dose of 200 cGy. During TLD calibration and TBI in vivo dosimetry, TLDs were read 24 h post-irradiation. TLD chips showing response within ±1% of the mean response of the entire set were chosen as golden chips. After identifying the golden chips, TLD chips were again annealed and irradiated in the standard setup to a known dose. The reader response to these golden chips was used as the calibration factor for the TLD reader. Figure 2 shows the glow curve obtained from the TLD reader during TLD calibration. The remaining TLD chips other than the golden chips, known as field dosimeters, were read to generate their unique calibration factors. These field dosimeters were then used as the detectors in TBI in vivo dosimetry.
In vivo dosimetry check Dosimetry results of 20 TBI patients (aged between
3 years and 28 years) treated between March 2008 and December 2011 were analyzed in this study. Prescription

depth ranged from 4.4 to 9.2 cm among these 20 patients. The intention of the in vivo dosimetry check was to ensure that the prescription dose was delivered accurately and uniformly throughout the patient's body. Sensitivity of the TLD has to be checked before using it on each patient. Hence, before using TLD for every TBI patient, both sets of TLDs were exposed to a known dose (200 cGy) at the standard setup used for TLD calibration. Subsequently, only those TLDs whose response fell within ±3% of the given dose during this sensitivity check were used for the in vivo dosimetry. TLDs were recalibrated if the whole set of TLDs showed more than 3% difference between the given dose and the measured dose during this sensitivity check. The measured dose values by each TLD set during the multiple sensitivity checks performed were averaged out and are shown in Figure 3.
TLDs along with wax bolus over each TLD were kept at forehead, mediastinum, chest, abdomen, pelvis, thigh, and calf during in vivo dosimetry. Thickness of the bolus was maintained as 5 mm to achieve buildup region. From the results, minimum, maximum, and average measured dose values at each anatomical site were analyzed. Prescription dose was divided into different ranges (<95%, 95-105%, and >105%), and an analysis was made for all sites on how many number of times the measured dose falls in each dose range. Mean dose to the whole body with standard deviation was calculated for each fraction of the treatment to check the homogeneity in the dose delivery.
Results and Discussion
Table 1 shows the minimum, maximum, and average measured dose at each site. Due to the large variation in body thickness and internal tissue heterogeneities, the minimum dose and maximum dose measured at each site had a significant variation (>10%) from the prescription dose. However, an analysis on the average measured dose from each site among the whole data set reveals that the average dose to each site falls between 96% and 102% of the prescription dose.

forehead show an average measured dose value of 97.33%. The average measured dose at mediastinum was 96%, with 95.65% at the anterior mediastinum and 96.4% at the posterior upper chest. The average dose to chest from the four TLDs used on chest was 99.4%. Dose measured at the right chest was found to be about 1% higher than the dose measured at the left chest. Dose recorded from abdomen and pelvis followed similar patterns. The average measured dose levels at umbilicus, posterior pelvis, and abdomen were 96.07%, 96.75%, and 96.99%, respectively. Eight TLDs were used for the legs, four on the thigh and four on the calf. The average measured dose values to thigh and calf were 97% and 101%, respectively.
It is observed that the minimum and maximum dose measured at each site varied significantly from the average dose for that site (e.g., the difference between average dose and minimum dose for left posterior calf was more than 16%). Hence, to understand how frequently the dose measured at each site is deviating from the average dose,

Ganapathy, et al.:Patient dose analysis in total body irradiation 217
results for each site are distributed into different dose ranges [Table 2]. An analysis of the same would give an idea on what dose shall be expected from each site. In most of the instances (more than 80% of the time), the dose measured at mediastinum, abdomen, forehead, and pelvis falls between 95% and 105% of the prescription dose. This pattern was followed by thigh (68.8%), chest (66.3%), and calf (65.9%) for recording 95-105% of the prescription dose.
Though the minimum dose for each site from the whole data is below 95% of the prescribed dose, this occurred on a few occasions only (6.5-19.2% of the measurement times for different sites). The prescription depth is significantly different from the midline depth for sites like pelvis and calf, as the dose is prescribed to the midline depth of the patient's average body thickness. When the thickness of the pelvis is larger than the average patient thickness, a lesser dose is expected to be measured from the TLDs kept on pelvis. Thus, TLDs kept in pelvic region recorded a dose less than 95% of the prescription dose on more occasions compared to TLDs from other sites. In spite of the proper instructions given to patients, on few occasions, there is a possibility of patient movement during the treatment due to the long duration of the treatment time. This movement of the patient can also result in a significant variation in the measured dose.
In calf, chest, and thigh, the dose measured was more than 105% of the prescribed dose at least once. Thickness of the calf is lesser than the average patient thickness. This resulted in the TLDs kept at calf to record a dose as high as 110% of the prescribed dose. Calf used to be the region to receive the maximum dose among all the sites in a single fraction. The same reason of lesser thickness is applicable for the TLD kept on thigh also (for more than 15.8% of measurement times, the measured dose at thigh was greater than 105% of the prescription dose). Another site in which the dose recorded was greater than 105% of the prescription dose is chest. This is due to the tissue inhomogeneity present in the chest region. In other sites, the measured dose was higher than the prescription dose on fewer instances and it was always less than 5%. There are few inherent uncertainties in the TLD dosimetry system in its various stages like annealing, calibration procedure, and TLD readout. Kirby et al. have reported that ± 2% uncertainty in the measured dose and ±5% action criterion for TLD dosimetry are reasonable while using TLD for absorbed dose measurements.[7]
Measurements at many sites, particularly chest and pelvis, correlated well with the study results of Lancaster et al. Dose to chest in our measurements was 99.4% compared to 99.3% in their measurements using semiconductor diodes. Dose levels measured on pelvis, abdomen, and head showed the lowest agreement with the study by Lancaster et al.

218 Ganapathy, et al.:Patient dose analysis in total body irradiation
Similarly, these are the sites in which the dose measured was less than 95% of the prescribed dose on more occasions in our measurements.
Homogeneous dose delivery to the whole body is a requirement in TBI.[8] To check the uniformity in dose delivery, mean dose of the doses measured from all sites was calculated with standard deviation for each patient. The standard deviation is given in cGy, and it indicates the variation to which the dose is delivered uniformly throughout the body. The mean dose to whole body (135.5-151.7 cGy) was close to the prescription dose for most patients and was within ±10% of the prescription dose for all patients in our TBI in vivo dosimetry. The standard deviation values were observed to be between 6.4 cGy and 18.3 cGy. Figure 4 shows the mean dose with standard deviation values calculated for all patients. Though dose homogeneity along the body axis within ±10% is acceptable for most of the TBI protocols, this was significantly worse compared to the in vivo dosimetry results reported by Palkosková et al. The main factor worsening the dose homogeneity in the technique used in our TBI protocol was the dose to extremities and chest.
Conclusion
The TBI treatment protocol used in this study is simple and easy to implement. In any single fraction of TBI with the treatment technique used in this study, a dose within ±5% of the prescription dose is expected to be measured from all the sites except calf and chest when TLD is used for the in vivo dosimetry. The practice of using LiF TLD100 for in vivo dosimetry is a good option for TBI dosimetry. The same could be used in similar quality assurance checks for other techniques in radiotherapy, if the TLDs are properly calibrated and checked for the particular technique. With our in-house TBI protocol of AP-PA fields with 6 MV photon beams, 10% dose homogeneity was achieved consistently. A better homogeneity in dose delivery is possible by adding tissue compensators for extremities and chest. Also, accurate and more consistent results could be expected if a detector which has less uncertainty in measuring the delivered dose is used. With this observation, we have started exploring the use of GAFCHROMIC EBT2 film by using the film along with

TLD in our TBI dosimetry, and the results can be analyzed to standardize the technique in future.

Abstract
Berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from Rhizoma coptidis, is reported to possess antiviral activity. Our previous study has shown that BBR alleviates coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) replication in HeLa cells. However, the anti- CVB3 activity of BBR is still unclear in vivo. In this study, we explored the effect of BBR on CVB3-induced viral myocarditis in mice. These results demonstrated the beneficial effect of BBR on alleviating CVB3-induced myocarditis in vivo, which sheds new light on the utility of BBR as a therapeutic strategy against CVB3-induced viral myocarditis.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Myocarditis, an inflammatory disease of the myocardium, is primarily caused by a viral infection.1 Many viruses are responsible for causing viral myocarditis (VMC). Among these, coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is one of the most common pathogens.2 Mechanistically, previous studies have shown that CVB3-induced myocarditis is associated with the direct damage of cardiomyocytes during viral replication.3 In addition, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the excessive inflammation caused by immune cells, such as macrophages, plays an important role in the progression of heart

injury in CVB3-induced VMC.4 Nevertheless, at present, the pathogenesis of CVB3-induced VMC remains incompletely understood. Even though symptomatic treatments have been widely utilized to relieve CVB3-induced myocarditis, effective strategies that can treat CVB3-induced VMC are currently unavailable.
Berberine (BBR) is an isoquinoline alkaloid that is extracted from Rhizoma coptidis (also named "Huang Lian" in Chinese).5 It is reported that BBR has multi-pharmacological effects, such as antidiarrheal, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and antioxidative effects.6 In recent years, a growing body of studies has revealed the antiviral activity of BBR against a variety of viruses, such as chikungunya

virus (CHKV), Semliki Forest virus, Sindbis virus, enterovirus 71, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).7 In addition, our previous study has uncovered the anti-CVB3 activity of BBR in vitro.8 But the effects of BBR on alleviating CVB3-induced myocarditis remain unknown in vivo.
To explore the antiviral effects of BBR in vivo, a mouse model with intraperitoneal infection of CVB3 was utilized. Our findings suggest that BBR increased the survival rate and heart function, whereas reducing heart injury and myocardial viral titer in CVB3-induced myocarditis mice. Meanwhile, BBR treatment inhibited macrophage infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines production in CVB3-induced myocarditis in mice. Collectively, the present study evaluates the antiviral activity of BBR in vivo model of CVB3-induced myocarditis, providing a new hint of BBR as a therapeutic agent against CVB3-induced VMC.

2.2 | Mouse models of CVB3 infection
The 6-week-old male BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to four groups containing CVB3, CVB3 + BBR (50 mg/kg), CVB3+BBR (100 mg/kg), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and each group consisted of 12 mice. On Day 1, the mice were intraperitoneally injected with 100 l of 3 × 107 plaque-forming units (PFU/ml) of CVB3 diluted in PBS. Treatments were started the day before CVB3 infection. BBR (50 mg/kg/day), BBR (100 mg/kg/day) or PBS (0.5% DMSO) was treated daily by oral gavage. After 7 days, the mice were killed, following which, the hearts and spleens were harvested for subsequent analyses. For clarification, the experimental protocol is shown in Figure 1B.

using a rabbit anti-CVB3 polyclonal antibody (1:100; Millipore; Cat No: 2234140) as the primary antibody. Nonimmune goat serum was used as negative control. After incubation with the indicated antibody, the tissue sections were visualized by 3,3-diaminobenzidine (Zhongshan) and observed under a light microscope (Olympus BX63).
Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was performed to identify the infiltrated macrophages in mouse myocardium by incubating the tissues with mouse anti-CD68 (1:200; Santa Cruz; Cat No: sc-52998) monoclonal antibody, followed by hybridization with Dylight 649 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000; Invitrogen). The nuclei of the cells were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:1000; Beyotime). Images were acquired and analyzed using a Leica TCS SP5 laser confocal microscope.

2.3 | Determination of myocardial edema and lesion
To determine the presence of heart edema, whole hearts from the mice infected with CVB3 or/and treated with BBR for 7 days were removed and weighed. Mouse heart edema was evaluated by calculating the heart weight (after blood flushing) to body weight ratio (HW/BW). The heart tissues were fixed in 4% neutral buffered formalin and were then embedded in paraffin and cut into 3 m sections. The heart tissue sections were visualized by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The percent area of cellular infiltration and myocardial necrosis was graded in a blinded manner by 2 observers on observation of five microscopic views from each heart section, and scored as follows: 0, no lesion; 1+, lesions involving < 25%; 2+, lesions involving 25% to 50%; 3+, lesions involving 50% to 75%; 4+, lesions involving >75%. To further measure the severity of myocardial damage, the serum contents including serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), and creatine kinase-MB fraction (CK-MB) were determined using an automatic biochemistry analyzer Hitachi 7170S (Hitachi).
2.4 | Cardiac echocardiography analysis
The mice infected with CVB3 or underwent BBR treatment for 7 days were subjected to transthoracic echocardiographic measurement for the evaluation of mouse heart function. Cardiac echocardiography including the contents of ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) was performed using a Vevo 2100 high- resolution ultrasound system (Visualsonics) equipped with a 30-MHz, 100-frame-per-second micro visualization scan head.
2.5 | Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining
To direct observe virus particles in the mouse heart tissues, the heart paraffin sections were stained by immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay

2.6 | Flow cytometry analysis
The splenocytes from the CVB3- or/and BBR-treated mice on 7 days postinfection were isolated and suspended in PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The red blood cells were lysed in red cell lysis buffer (Tiangen) for 5 min, and the remaining cells were collected and resuspended in 1% FBS/PBS at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were stained with cell surface marker antibodies including APC anti-mouse CD3 (Cat No: 561826), FITC anti-mouse CD4 (Cat No: 561831), and PE anti-mouse CD8 (Cat No: 561095) antibodies (BD Biosciences). After the cells had been stained at 4°C for 1 h, the samples were washed in 1% FBS/PBS and measured by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur cell sorter (Beckman). The data were analyzed using CellQuest software.
2.7 | Measurements of cytokines and chemokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
The cytokines and chemokines including tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL5, and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) in the serum samples were detected by using the corresponding ELISA kits (Westang) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2.8 | Real-time PCR
The real-time PCR assays for analyzing the gene expression of CVB3 capsid vp1 was applied following the manufacturer's instructions (Takara). Relative gene expression was determined by the comparative C(t) (2-Ct) method with GAPDH as the endogenous control. The primers used were as follows:

Mice were killed at Day 7 postinfection. Hearts were collected under aseptic conditions and homogenized in 1 ml of PBS. Heart homogenates were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. The virus titers

were determined by a 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay.9 Briefly, HeLa cells were seeded into 96-well plates until they reached 70% confluence. A series of diluted supernatants were inoculated with HeLa cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 72 h. The virus titers were calculated by the Reed-Muench method.

3.1 | BBR improves survival in CVB3-infected mice
To analyze the probable protective efficacy of BBR against CVB3 infection in mouse model, the mice that suffered from CVB3 infection were daily administrated with BBR by gavage. After BBR treatment for 7 days, the mice infected with CVB3 alone showed a 45.83% survival rate, whereas the mice treated with CVB3+BBR showed a 62.50% (BBR 50 mg/kg) and 79.17% (BBR 100 mg/kg) survival rate (Figure 1C). Even though the survival rate of CVB3+BBR (50 mg/kg)-treated mice was not statistically different from the CVB3-infected mice, the survival rate of the CVB3+BBR

| 3585
(100 mg/kg)-treated mice was significantly higher than that of the CVB3-infected mice (Figure 1C), suggesting that BBR may be used as a protective reagent against CVB3 infection in vivo.
3.2 | BBR protects mice from CVB3-induced heart lesion
To further evaluate the protective effect of BBR on CVB3-infected mice, the hearts of CVB3-infected mice treated with or without BBR were harvested. The evaluation of heart edema as determined by the HW/BW ratio revealed that BBR treatment significantly reduced heart edema in CVB3-infected mice (Figure 1D,E). The analysis of heart lesion by H&E staining demonstrated that the mice infected with CVB3 suffering from BBR treatment displayed less myocardial necrosis than the CVB3-infected mice (Figures 2A,B). Given myocardial lesion might lead to increased levels of CK-MB, AST, CK, and LDH in serum, we further analyzed the contents of myocardial enzymes in the serum of the mice. Lower contents of CK-MB, AST, CK, and LDH were observed in the mice treated with CVB3+BBR than the mice that suffered from CVB3 infection (Figure 2C-F). Therefore, these results demonstrated that BBR protects mice from CVB3- induced heart damage.

3.3 | BBR protects heart function from CVB3- induced myocarditis in vivo
To observe the role of BBR in protecting mice from CVB3-induced heart dysfunction, the cardiac function indexes including EF and FS were evaluated by cardiac echocardiography. The CVB3-infected mice treated with BBR showed an increased EF and FS compared to CVB3-infected mice (Figure 3A-C), suggesting that BBR protects the mice from CVB3-induced heart dysfunction.
3.4 | BBR inhibits CVB3 titer in vivo

that CVB3 particles (Figure 4A) as well as vp1 mRNA expression level (Figure 4B) in the mouse myocardium were lower in the CVB3+BBR-treated mice than that in the CVB3-infected mice. The virus titer in the heart homogenates of the CVB3+BBR-treated mice also showed a lower level than that observed in the CVB3-infected mice (Figure 4C), confirming that BBR attenuates CVB3-induced heart injury through the inhibition of virus replication.
3.5 | BBR diminishes CVB3-induced production of pro-inflammtory mediators and macrophage infiltration in vivo

Numerous studies have suggested that CVB3 replication might directly lead to myocardium injury.10,11 As BBR significantly impaired CVB3-induced mouse mortality and heart injury (Figures 1 and 2), we further evaluated whether the protective efficacy of BBR occurs through the direct inhibition of CVB3 replication. Results revealed

Excessive inflammation plays a crucial role in the progression of virus-induced myocardial injury.10 Therefore, in this study, we firstly investigated the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the serums of CVB3-infected mice. ELISA assay revealed that the levels of TNF-, IL-6, IL-1, CCL2, CCL5, and

CXCL10 were significantly decreased in the serum of the CVB3+BBR-treated mice when compared to that of the CVB3- infected mice (Figure 5A-F). Given macrophage over activation is responsible for the production of the pro-inflammatory mediators as well as the promotion of inflammation-induced heart lesion upon CVB3 infection, we further analyzed the percentage of infiltrated macrophages in the heart tissues of CVB3-infected mice followed by BBR treatment. Results from IF staining showed that the percentage of infiltrated CD68+ macrophages in the myocardium of CVB3+BBR-treated mice were significantly lower than that of the CVB3-infected mice (Figure 6A), indicating that BBR decreases the infiltration of inflammation-related macrophages upon CVB3 infection.
In addition to the inhibition of inflammation response upon virus infection, activation of T cell response has also been implied to reduce CVB3-induced tissue damage. Hence, we further analyzed the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in heart tissues upon CVB3 infection and BBR treatment. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the proportion of CD4+/CD3+ T cells or CD8+/CD3+ T cells in the spleens of the CVB3+BBR-treated mice was comparable to that observed in the CVB3-infected mice (Figure 6B-E), indicating that BBR does not apparently alter T cell-mediated antiviral activity in CVB3-induced myocarditis.

4 | DISCUSSION
Myocarditis is often defined as an inflammatory condition of the heart. Although it can be caused by pathogens or noninfectious agents, the virus is the major cause of myocarditis.12 A variety of viruses are associated with myocarditis in humans, including enteroviruses, adenoviruses, influenza viruses, cytomegaloviruses, parvoviruses, herpes viruses, and human immunodeficiency virus. Moreover, it has been well-known that the CVB3 is the most prevalent pathogen in causing VMC.13,14 However, there is no specific treatment to deal with CVB3-induced myocarditis in the clinic.
It has been reported that BBR has multi-pharmacological efficacy, such as antiviral, antibacterial, and hypotensive efficacies.15 In our previous work, we have shown that BBR exerts an antiviral effect by inhibiting the replication of CVB3 in HeLa cells.8 Mechanistically, BBR- mediated inhibition of CVB3 has been demonstrated to be dependent on the suppression of the JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathway. However, it remains to be further investigated whether BBR is effective in impairing CVB3-induced VMC in vivo. Therefore, we further investigated BBR's antiviral activity in vivo by using a CVB3-induced myocarditis mouse model. Here, we provided evidence showing that BBR reduces CVB3-induced mouse mortality and myocardial lesions as well as relieves heart dysfunction by lowering virus titers. Similar to

our study, other researchers have discovered that 2-(3,4-dichloro- phenoxy)-5-nitrobenzonitrile reduces CVB3-induced myocarditis by decreasing CVB3 titers,16 further proving that the reduction of virus- induced damage is vital for relieving the development of CVB3 myocarditis.
Apart from virus replication-induced tissue damage,10,11 research have also demonstrated that the excessive inflammatory reaction-induced upon CVB3 infection can aggravate tissue injury.17 Specifically, the sustained production of pro- inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and recruitment of overactive immune cells contribute to the pathological changes of the CVB3-infected mouse myocardium.18 In this study, BBR treatment has been proven to reduce the infiltration of pro-inflammatory

macrophages, and production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines following CVB3 infection in vivo, suggesting that BBR relieves CVB3 myocarditis through the suppression of pro- inflammtory mediator generation and macrophage infiltration caused by CVB3 replication. Consistent with our findings, researchers from other groups have also demonstrated a protective efficacy of BBR against other virus-associated infection by reducing the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.19,20
In summary, our studies demonstrated that BBR exhibits protective efficacy against CVB3-induced myocarditis in mice by inhibiting CVB3 replication, production of pro-inflammatory mediators, and macrophage infiltration, indicating the therapeutic potential of BBR on attenuating CVB3 infection in vivo.

Yuta Sumikamaa, c, Hiroshige Aoyamab, Norifumi Isub, Masaaki Nagatab, Takumi Katoa, Takayoshi Tsukaharaa

Abstract
Background: There are many patients who need to restrict and assess salt in their diet. However, it is difficult to estimate daily salt intake accurately and easily. Therefore, a method for estimating dietary salt intake using the overnight urinary sodium (Na)/potassium (K) ratio was developed.
Methods: The study involved 43 healthy adults (13 males, 30 females). From 2018 to 2020, subjects consumed a salt-adjusted diet for 11 - 30 days continuously, and overnight urine was collected daily. Using the previous day's salt intake as the objective variable, an equation for estimating the salt intake was developed using a general linear model. To verify the accuracy of the estimating equation, the estimated salt intake of the previous day was calculated using our equation and Tanaka's equation, which is an estimating equation from spot urine widely used in clinical practice and epidemiological studies to estimate dietary salt intake, and they were compared with the actual salt intake.
Results: The results of the analysis showed that model 1 (previous day's salt intake (g) = 3.62 + 0.64 × urinary Na/K ratio + 0.18 × conductivity (mS/cm) - 0.43 × sex (male 0, female 1)) was the optimal model. Then, salt intake was estimated using model 1 and Tanaka's equation, and compared with actual salt intake. The Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient between the actual and estimated salt intake was r = 0.618 (P < 0.001) and r = 0.573 (P < 0.001) for model 1 estimates and Tanaka's equation estimates, respectively. The percentages of errors within ±30% from the actual salt intake were 64.2% and 58.4% for model 1 and Tanaka's equation, respectively.
Conclusion: An equation for estimating salt intake was developed using the Na/K ratio and conductivity of overnight urine. Although the applicability of this method to hypertensive patients and the elderly

has not been studied and needs to be clarified in the future, the estimating equation developed is simple and may be a useful method for daily monitoring of dietary salt intake.
Keywords: Salt intake; Na/K ratio; Sodium; Potassium; Urine
Introduction
The relationship between salt intake and blood pressure has been reported by many epidemiological studies [1, 2], and excessive salt intake is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stomach cancer [2-6]. In addition, some intervention studies have demonstrated that reducing dietary salt intake lowers blood pressure [7-9], and salt restriction is recommended in guidelines for hypertension [10].
One of the barriers to successful salt restriction is the difficulty in estimating dietary salt intake. The gold standard for estimating an individual's daily salt intake is the 24-h urine collection method [11, 12], but this method is not suitable for daily monitoring because of the high burden on patients. Several other simple methods for estimating salt intake by spot urine have been reported [13-15], but they are not recommended because of their low accuracy for individual estimation [16]. In addition, estimation by spot urine requires measurement of creatinine (Cr), which is difficult to measure at home and therefore cannot be used for daily monitoring. There are methods for estimating salt intake at home using electrical conductivity (conductivity), but these methods have problems in daily monitoring, such as overestimation of salt intake due to increased potassium (K) intake and the need to collect whole urine [17].
The Na/K ratio, which is calculated by dividing the urinary sodium (Na) concentration by the K concentration, is being used in medical examinations as an index to evaluate daily dietary content [18, 19]. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a decrease in salt intake and an increase in K intake and suggests that the guideline-targeted Na and K intake levels would yield a Na/K molar ratio of approximately 1.0 [20, 21]. Furthermore, the urinary Na/K ratio can be easily measured by a portable device. Thus, we investigated an equation for estimating dietary salt intake using the overnight urinary Na/K ratio as a simple measurement without the need for Cr measurements for daily monitoring. In our previous study, we developed an equation for estimating salt intake, but the range

of possible estimates was too narrow, and the equation tended to overestimate the low-salt zone [22]. One of the reasons for the overestimation was thought to be the lack of data for lowsalt meals, so this study was conducted to improve the accuracy of the estimating equation by adding data for low-salt meals.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
This study included 43 healthy adults (13 males, 30 females) who were recruited from 2018 to 2020. Of the 43 volunteers, 31 were recruited from students at Nagoya University of Arts and Sciences and 12 were recruited from the general population at HUMA R&D Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). The participants were healthy volunteers without hypertension, kidney disease, or other known diseases, and who were not taking regular medication. Smokers were excluded from this study. Weight and blood pressure were measured daily during the study period to confirm that there were no fluctuations. This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures involving research study participants were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Nagoya University of Arts and Sciences (186, 234, 242, 338, and 437).
Intake of salt formula diet
The subjects consumed a salt-adjusted meal for 11 - 30 days. The amount of salt was adjusted every few days in the range of 2 - 19 g. All nutrient intakes were calculated by confirming nutrient amounts from the Standard Tables of Food Composition in Japan 2015 (seventh revised edition) or from food packaging. The meals were cooked with all ingredients strictly weighed, and the subjects consumed everything completely, including seasonings, sauce and soup. Additional and reduced dietary intakes were allowed only if the exact amount of the nutrient was known, and all these intakes were recorded. Consumption of alcohol was prohibited during this study.
Urine collection and measurement
The overnight urine, which is the first morning voided urine, was collected daily. The Na concentration, K concentration, Na/K ratio, and Cr concentration in the collected urine samples were measured at the Nagoya Medical Cooperative Association Nagoya Clinical Laboratory Center. Specific gravity was measured using a PAL-09S (ATAGO Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), and the conductivity was measured using a LAQUAtwin <EC-33B> (HORIBA Ltd, Kyoto, Japan). In addition, urine weight was measured.
Statistical analysis
The following variables were used for analysis in this study:

previous day's salt intake, urinary Na, K, and Cr concentrations, urinary Na/K ratio, conductivity, specific gravity, urine weight, height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), age, and sex. Data are expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD), with differences between the two groups examined for significance using Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. The association between each variable was determined using Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient. Using the previous day's salt intake as the objective variable, an equation for estimating salt intake was developed using a general linear model. To verify the accuracy of the estimating equation, the estimated salt intake of the previous day was calculated using our equation and Tanaka's equation [13], and the results were compared with the actual measured salt intake. All analyses were performed using R version 4.0.3. P values < 0.05 were considered significant.
Results
Subjects' characteristics
The characteristics of the subjects are shown in Table 1. All subjects completed this study. The average age of the 43 subjects, which included 13 males and 30 females, was 28.2 ± 10.8 years overall, 32.9 ± 13.0 years for males, and 26.2 ± 9.3 years for females (P-value between males and females = 0.008). Height and weight were both significantly higher in males than in females (P < 0.001 for both). The BMI was not significantly different between males and females.
Salt intake and urine measurements
Salt intake and urine measurements are shown in Table 1. Salt intake was 8.44 ± 3.42 g overall, 7.91 ± 3.54 g in males, and 8.62 ± 3.36 g in females (P = 0.006). There were significant differences in urinary Na concentration, urinary Na/K ratio, and conductivity between males and females (all P < 0.001). There was no difference in urinary K concentration and specific gravity between males and females.
Equation for estimating salt intake using the overnight urinary Na/K ratio
Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient was calculated for each variable (previous day's salt intake, urinary Na/K ratio, urinary Na concentration, urinary K concentration, conductivity, specific gravity, urine weight, height, weight, and age). Results are shown as a correlation matrix between each of the variables (Table 2). The urinary Na/K ratio and conductivity were significantly positively related to the previous day's salt intake (r = 0.522, P < 0.001 and r = 0.433, P < 0.001, respectively). Since there were significant differences in the urinary Na/K ratio and conductivity between sexes, a regression equation to estimate the previous day's salt intake was developed using a general regression model with urinary

The mean ± SD values of the actual salt intake, the model 1 estimate, and Tanaka's equation estimate were 8.44 ± 3.42 g, 8.51 ± 2.13 g, and 7.14 ± 1.79 g, respectively. The medians (interquartile range) were 8.70 (5.80 - 10.73) g, 8.12 (6.85 - 9.75) g, and 7.02 (5.87 - 8.25) g, respectively. Model 1 was closer to the actual salt intake in the high salt zone (75th percentile), but overestimated the values in the low salt zone (25th percentile). On the other hand, Tanaka's equation was closer to the actual salt intake in the low-salt zone, but underestimated the value in the highsalt zone. Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient between the actual and estimated salt intake was r = 0.618 (P < 0.001) and r = 0.573 (P < 0.001) for the model 1 estimate and Tanaka's equation estimate, respectively. The percentages of errors within ±30% from the actual salt intake were 64.2% and 58.4% for model 1 and Tanaka's equation, respectively (Fig. 1). The percentages of errors within ± 1.0 g from the actual salt intake were 25.0% and 25.6% for model 1 and Tanaka's equa-

tion, respectively (Fig. 1).
Discussion
A regression equation to estimate the previous day's salt intake using a general regression model with the urinary Na/K ratio, conductivity, and sex as explanatory variables was developed. Model 1 (previous day's salt intake (g) = 3.62 + 0.64 × urinary Na/K ratio + 0.18 × conductivity (mS/cm) - 0.43 × sex (males 0, females 1)) was found to be the optimal model.
There is diurnal variation in urinary Na and K excretion and the urinary Na/K ratio [23]. Cogswell et al [24] reported that the estimation of salt intake using spot urine varied depending on the timing of urine collection. Thus, the accuracy of these estimating equations may depend on the timing of collection. Therefore, in this study, an estimating equation limited to overnight urine was developed, considering the variability of the estimate due to this diurnal variation. Overnight urine may be useful for daily monitoring because it has a longer urine storage time and is often voided at home or in a limited location for each individual.
In the present study, not only the urinary Na/K ratio, but also the conductivity was used as an explanatory variable in the estimating equation. Conductivity is an indicator that reflects the concentration of electrolytes in a substance and can be used to measure the concentration of electrolytes in urine. A simple measurement device for estimating salt intake using overnight urine conductivity has been developed by Yamasue

et al [17]. However, this device calculates the urinary Na and K excretion ratio as 7:3 (Na/K ratio 2.3) because the conductivity cannot measure urinary Na and K separately. Therefore, if the Na and K intake ratio deviates from this assumption, it becomes an error factor in the estimation of salt intake. The use of two variables in the estimating equation of this study, urinary Na/K, which decreases with increasing K intake, and conductivity, which increases, may reduce the error due to K intake.
The estimating equation developed in this study was compared with Tanaka's equation to verify its accuracy. Tanaka's equation was developed using data from 591 Japanese individuals and is now widely used in clinical practice and epidemiological studies to estimate dietary salt intake [25, 26]. Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient between the actual salt intake and estimated salt intake was r = 0.618 (P < 0.001) and r = 0.573 (P < 0.001) for the model 1 equation estimates and Tanaka's equation estimates, respectively. The percentages of errors within ±30% from the actual salt intake were 64.2% and 58.4% for model 1 and Tanaka's equation, respectively. Zhou et al [16] reported that the percentage of errors within ±30% for the three estimating equations, Tanaka's equation, Kawasaki's equation, and the INTERSALT equation, were 64.5%, 57.4%, and 41.8%, respectively, in a Chinese population. Cogswell et al [24] reported that the correlation between estimated and measured 24-h urinary sodium excretion using Tanaka's equation with overnight urine was r = 0.47 in 406 residents of Washington. Model 1 developed in the present study had accuracy equal to or better than the accuracy of Tanaka's equation reported in previous studies. Zhou et al [16] reported that, among the three estimating equations, Tanaka's equation, Kawasaki's equation, and the INTERSALT equation, Tanaka's equation had the lowest error in the Chinese population, whereas Mayer et al [27] reported that the INTERSALT equation had the lowest error in the Norwegian population. Thus, the accuracy of the estimating equation varies depending on the validation population. Tanaka's equation was developed in the Japanese population, which has a relatively high salt intake, whereas the INTERSALT equation was developed in the Western population, which has a relatively low salt intake. Therefore, the estimation accuracy of the estimating equation may depend on the average salt intake of the population to be estimated.

Model 1: previous day's salt intake (g) = 3.62 + 0.64 × Na/K ratio + 0.18 × conductivity (mS/cm) - 0.43 × sex (males 0, females 1). Tanaka's equation: estimated 24HUNaV (mEq/day) = 21.98 × XNa0.392, where XNa = SUNa/SUCr × PRCr, SUNa is Na concentration in the spot voiding urine, SUCr
is creatinine concentration in the spot voiding urine, PRCr is predicted value of 24HUCr, PRCr = -2.04 × age + 14.89 × weight (kg) + 16.14 × height
(cm) - 2244.45. SD: standard deviation.

The medians (interquartile range) of the actual salt intake, the model 1 equation estimates, and Tanaka's equation estimates were 8.70 (5.80 - 10.73) g, 8.12 (6.85 - 9.75) g, and 7.02 (5.87 - 8.25) g, respectively. Model 1 was closer to the actual values in the high salt zone (75th percentile), but overestimated the values in the low salt zone (25th percentile). In contrast, Tanaka's equation was closer to the actual value in the low-salt zone, but underestimated the value in the high-salt zone. Estimating equations based on spot urine tend to overestimate in the low-salt zone and underestimate in the high-salt zone, because the range of possible estimates is narrow, and the estimated values are close to the mean value [28]. The same trend was observed in the present study. One of the reasons why the estimated low-salt zone by Tanaka's equation was close to the actual value is that the median of the estimated value was lower than the actual value. Furthermore, Tanaka's equation is a nonlinear estimating equation, whereas model 1 is a linear estimating equation. Model 1, which is linear, may overestimate the low salt zone because there is an intercept. It

is necessary to examine the estimating equation from this point of view in the future.
One of the strengths of this study is the development of an equation for estimating salt intake using actual salt intake, rather than the amount of Na excretion by 24-h urine collection. The equations of the previous study for estimating salt intake from spot urine, such as Tanaka's and Kawasaki's equations, estimate salt intake by a 24-h sodium excretion estimate. Although 24-h urine collection is considered the gold standard for estimating salt intake, the correlation between salt intake and estimates from a single 24-h urine collection is approximately r = 0.7, and differences occur between intake and excretion [29]. To omit this gap, an estimating equation was developed using actual salt intake as the objective variable in the present study, which may reduce the error in the process of calculating salt intake.
Second, the formula in this study is simple and easy to use for daily monitoring. Takada et al showed that daily monitoring using a simple urine salt analyzer was effective in reducing salt intake and lowering blood pressure [30]. If a urine meas-

urement device using the equation in this study is developed, it may be useful as a daily home monitoring tool. Previous studies have reported a linear association between cardiovascular disease events and estimated sodium intake using multiple 24-h urine collections, the gold standard for salt intake estimation [31-33]. On the other hand, WHO has recommended reducing salt intake as a population approach not only in individuals with hypertension but also in individuals without hypertension [20]. Therefore, daily monitoring of salt intake in individuals without hypertension may contribute to the reduction of the risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease in the general population.
However, there are some limitations in this study. First, in this study, data from persons aged 28.2 ± 10.8 years were used to develop the estimating equation, which is a narrow age range with many young people. Although the prevalence of hypertension increases with aging, the applicability of the estimating equation developed in the present study has not yet been validated in patients older than the subjects in this study. Several previous studies have reported higher overnight urinary Na excretion in hypertensive patients and patients with chronic kidney disease [34-36]. On the other hand, these previous studies also reported higher overnight urinary K excretion in these patients. Iwahori et al have observed the diurnal variation of Na/K ratio in 122 participants and reported that diurnal variations in urinary Na/K ratios were comparable between normotensive and hypertensive individuals, and among age and gender-specific subgroups [23]. There may not have been a difference in the Na/K ratio because the overnight urinary excretion of both Na and K is increased in hypertensive patients. Therefore, it may be applicable to these patients. We have not investigated the applicability of our estimating equation to hypertensive patients or elderly patients, so it is necessary to clarify its applicability in the future.
Second, there is insufficient validation of accuracy in external populations. Tanaka's equation and Kawasaki's equation were validated with external populations in their development [13, 14]. In the present study, accuracy validation was conducted using data from the population for which the estimating equation was developed, so the estimating equation may have been overfitted. Finally, the effect of K intake has not been investigated. The urinary Na/K ratio decreases with increasing K intake. However, to what extent increased K intake decreases the urinary Na/K ratio is unknown because increased K intake enhances Na excretion [37]. In contrast, conductivity increases with increasing K intake. Therefore, whether the present estimating equation will underestimate due to increased K intake is not known. Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of K intake.
Accurate salt intake estimation requires 24-h urine collection [11, 12], but this is a burden on the patient, and incomplete collection is a problem [38, 39]. In addition, several estimating equations by spot urine have been developed [13-15], but these equations are difficult to measure at home because they require Cr measurement and are not suitable for daily monitoring. However, the Na/K ratio and conductivity used in the present estimating equation can be easily measured at home. Therefore, although there are some limitations in the present estimating equation, it can be used for daily monitoring of patients who require salt restriction, and it can contribute to im-

proving the adherence of patients to salt restriction.
Conclusion
An equation for estimating salt intake was developed using the Na/K ratio and conductivity of overnight urine without the need for Cr measurement. This estimating equation is simple and may be a useful method for daily monitoring of dietary salt intake.

Welcome address
About half of the human population lives and works in rural areas, mainly engaged in agricultural activities. This ancient human activity produces food and uses land in a world where the demand for food is growing very quickly, and the quality and quantity of food are basic needs to ensure the health of millions of people. At the same time, agricultural activities are capable of causing environmental resource depletion and varying levels of pollution. Likewise, rural areas are directly linked with the wellbeing of entire communities, as demonstrated by the recent outbreaks of infectious diseases that were triggered in rural settings. Despite their major social, cultural, ecological and demographic relevance, rural areas are largely neglected by scientific research, health prevention and social protection. Rural inhabitants are suffering from an evident gap in life quality, sanitation, income, and distribution of social protection and economic benefits, including occupational health protection and services, as compared to urban dwellers. Importantly, rural communities are organized in villages, where agriculture and related activities are carried out very often by entire families, in which women, children and elderly represent an important proportion. The village is the target of all preventive interventions in rural areas. Only a healthy village, inhabited by healthy dwellers, can produce healthy food for the entire community while respecting the living environment. At the end of the 16th International Congress on Rural Health, held in Lodi (Italy) on June 2006, the "Lodi Declaration on Healthy Villages" was approved, and the Campaign on Healthy Villages was launched. The Lodi Declaration highlighted that, due to the complexity and specificity of rural areas, the approach to rural health needs to be holistic, crosscutting, and integrative. Cross cutting needs include different levels of expertise (involving, for example, academia, rural health practitioners, rural community leaders and others), integration among disciplines (involving general medical practitioners, occupational and environmental medicine, agronomic sciences, veterinary medicine, rural sociology, and health systems), and collaboration among countries, particularly addressing the rural differences between the industrialized world, the growing developing countries and those countries still in transition. Consensus on these needs was partially achieved by the Cartagena Declaration issued during the 17th International Congress in Agricultural Medicine and Rural Health in October 2009, by means of which Latin America committed to strengthen Rural Health and Medicine in its region. The Lodi Declaration was adopted by the 18th International IARM Congress, and the Goa Declaration of December 12th, 2009 reaffirmed the relation between health, human rights, and economic growth underlining that health is more than a medical issue and that women's and children's health is a human rights issue and closely interlinked with the empowerment of women and girls resulting in gender equality.
However, the following specific objectives remain to be achieved: · Promoting universal coverage and access of disadvantaged populations to Primary Health Care and Occupational Health Care, to improve the health status of rural workers and dwellers and to reduce social inequalities; · Improving the overall quality of rural enterprises, to produce adequate amounts of high quality food, taking into account nutritional, safety and hygienic issues; · Reducing the environmental impact of agricultural activities all over in the world, through the diffusion of "green economy" principles; · Reducing the burden of disease attributable to occupational and environmental risks at the workplace, environmental pollutants generated by agricultural activities, and an unhealthy diet.

The opportunity: Milan is hosting the Universal Exhibition in 2015. The central topic is "Energy for Life, Feeding the Planet", by means of which the centrality of agriculture and rural areas in the world is strongly highlighted. This event constitutes a unique opportunity for organizing a four day event and calling professionals, experts and stakeholders from different areas of health and rural sciences unite jointly to address the varied aspects of agriculture and rural health, aimed at priority setting, making rural health problems visible, and finding feasible and sustainable solutions for rural populations.
The proposal This event is targeting all international experts in rural health in the world. It will be organized in such a way to ensure the participation of the main national and international associations and organizations involved in Rural Health along the lines already defined by WHO including its efforts towards the "Health for All" programme, by reinforcing Primary Health Care services as the way to achieve universal health service coverage, and, as highlighted in the den Haag Conference, towards the need of an integration of Occupational Health services within Primary Health Care. The main international associations active in the field will be also present: the International Association of Rural Medicine and Health (IARM), which has decided to organize during this Congress its own 18th World Congress, the Wonca party on Rural Practice, which will organize specific sessions and lectures, the International Commission on Occupational Health (ICOH), which will be present with five Scientific Committees, those on Rural Health, Occupational Toxicology, Toxicology of Metals, Occupational Health and Development, and Indoor Air quality and health together with the European Rural and Isolated Practitioners Association (EURIPA). This means that in this event all the main actors active in the world in the field of rural health will be present: this is a promise for a future of prevention and health in Rural Areas.

The 20th Congress of International Association of Rural Health and Medicine (IARM), in Tokyo, Japan, 2018
Greeting from Japanese colleagues,
First of all, on behalf of the Japanese Association of Rural Medicine (JARM), we would like to extend our sincere congratulations to all the participants for your contribution to the 19th Congress in Lodi, Italy. We would also like to take this opportunity to express our deepest gratitude to Professor Colosio and his team for all the efforts in organizing this successful Congress.
Japanese colleagues are honored to hear that the Board of IARM decided to hold the 20th Congress in Tokyo, Japan, 2018. We will try our best to prepare for the Congress. The theme for the 20th congress will be "Challenges to community-based rural medicine in aging societies with declining productive populations". The following explains what this exactly means.
In 2014, the number of births in our country was about 1 million and the number of deaths was 1.26 million. That led to the population decline of 260,000. The population thus dropped for the eighth straight year. By the year of 2025, it is widely reported, almost one in every five Japanese people (18.1%) will be age 75 or over, and elderly needing long-term care and requiring help will increase to 8.17 million.
In September 2011, a medical journal the Lancet released a special series on Japan that commemorated the 50th anniversary of its attainment of a universal health insurance system. The world sees Japan as a rare country that provides access to prompt and high-quality medical care equitably at low cost for the people and maintains the world's longest life expectancy. The series made scientific analysis and verification of many facets of the Japanese universal health care system: the reasons of Japan's remarkable achievements in life expectancy in a brief period of time; the advantages and limitations of the system; the actual status of high-quality medical care at low cost; the results and challenges of the long-term care insurance system for elderly people with a rapidly aging society; and the future of the system which enables people to keep an excellent health level equitably at low cost. The series also provided recommendations for experts inside and outside of Japan.
Recently, global attention, particularly that of countries facing similar problems, is drawn to the universal health insurance system in Japan and how we address issues of declining birthrates and an aging society. JA Koseiren Hospitals (Agricultural Cooperative Hospitals), which we work for, play

117
important roles as public hospitals in community-based rural medicine throughout Japan. They would like to present their achievements and future visions to international medical professionals. JARM has a long history and a large membership base of 4,500 physicians and researchers. Dr. Wakatsuki (one of the founders of the association) organized the 4th IARM Congress in Nagano, Japan in 1969. It has been quite some time since then. So, we are excited to host a joint congress of IARM and JARM in Tokyo where we would be able to offer all IARM members high-quality scientific programs as well as a platform for discussion on rural medicine of this century with experts from all over the world.
I look forward to seeing you again in Japan, 2018.
English will be the official language. We will provide simultaneous interpretation services at lectures and symposiums to overcome language barriers.

Whereas more than 50% of the world's population live in rural areas, with limited or no access to primary health care, basic occupational health care, clean water and sanitation,
Whereas unsustainable and unhealthy agricultural practices have influence on the rural population, with potential severe influence on the environment, wildlife, and urban population, through contaminated soil, water and food,
Whereas structural system-related determinants accompanied by unsafe work behaviours causes occupational and work-related diseases and injuries, disabilities, premature deaths, loss of income, as well as human suffering and poverty in rural areas,
Whereas children and women working in agriculture are especially vulnerable to occupational and environmental risks, in addition to consequences arising from the unavailability of basic health service and inadequate housing, in particular from household fuel combustion,
Whereas international, national and local actions, although significant and honourable, have not been able to respond successfully to all the challenges put before them,
Underlining that the achievement of the highest possible level of health for all people is impossible without improving the health of the rural population, and this is impossible without the involvement of the public sector as a whole,
Taking into consideration the Declaration of the International Conference on Primary Health Care, Alma-Ata, USSR, 1978, the Global Strategy on Occupational Health for All adopted by the World Health Assembly with Resolution 49.12 from 1996 and the Global Strategy on Occupational Safety and Health adopted by the International Labour Conference in 2003, the Safety and Health in Agriculture Convention, 2001 (No. 184) of the International Labour Organisation.

156
Recalling the outcomes of previous international deliberations on occupational health in agriculture and rural health, such as the Declaration of the First International Congress on Rural Health in the Mediterranean and Balkan Countries (Bari, Italy, 2002), the Agenda on Rural Health (Loni, India, 2002), the Declaration on Occupational and Environmental Rural Health (Belgrade, Serbia, 2004), the Lodi Declaration on Healthy Villages (Lodi, Italy, 2006), the Cartagena Declaration on Rural Health in Latin America (Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 2009), and the Goa Declaration for Health in the Global Village (Panaji, Goa, India, 2012),
Recalling the continuing appeal of spiritual and secular leaders and of scholars and scientists worldwide to a responsible stewardship of the Planet, to a shared and sustainable access to its natural and limited resources, to their preservation for future generations,
We, the 250 participants from 52 countries from all continents who took part in the International Congress on Rural Health and 4th Ragusa SHWA, held here in Lodi, Italy, from September 8th to September 11th, 2015, discussed the challenges to providing adequate occupational and environmental health, food safety, public health and medical services in rural areas, and
WE DECLARE THAT:
1. We will commit ourselves to help solving occupational, environmental and public health problems and inadequacies in access to health care in rural areas, in the frame of the WHO global strategy on people centred and integrated health service;
2. We will advocate for the elimination of child labour in rural and remote areas, recognition of informal and migrant agricultural workers, and abolishment of modern slavery;
3. We call for national and international organizations, as well as individuals to work on the improvement of the scope and coverage

157
of primary health care to address better the needs of rural communities inclusive needs related to health and safety at work such as agrochemical use, heavy physical work, accidents, heat stress, dehydration and kidney injuries, cancer due to solar radiation, biological risk factors and zoonoses;
4. We will work towards providing higher access of workers to occupational health care with the creation of basic occupational health services in rural areas wherever necessary,
5. We recognize the need for addressing occupational, environmental and public health risks in rural areas by working together with all of the stakeholders, governments, public sector a while, and industry, as well as the ministries of health, environment, labour, agriculture and other state agencies, private enterprises and workers' organizations;
6. We underline the significance of local, regional, national and international initiatives to protect and promote the health of the rural population;
7. We encourage the following organizations: The European Rural and Isolated Practitioners Association (EURIPA), The International Association on Rural Medicine and Health (IARM), the International Commission on Occupational Health (ICOH), the WONCA Working Party on Rural Practice, as well as the organizations of farmers, agricultural workers, agricultural industry, and the relevant non-governmental organizations and networks, to take action to support and promote the development of Rural Health programmes;
8. We will dedicate a significant part of our scientific and professional efforts to create useful, accessible, simple and low-cost tools for occupational, indoor and environmental risk assessment, communication and management;
9. We call upon the governmental agencies and local authorities to ensure equal and proper access of people in villages, to information

158
on public and occupational health and the environment, stimulate social and environmental justice, as well as to provide means for empowerment of rural populations to protect and promote their health, and to improve their working and living conditions. Access to health care should be treated as a basic human right. Use of ehealth and telemedicine should be promoted in rural area;
10. We congratulate our colleagues which have been working on opening reference centres at the local, national and international level for providing expertise and support to the rural population;
11. We call for the creation of interdisciplinary teams of experts from the field of human and veterinary medicine, public, occupational, and environmental health, health promotion, food safety, chemical safety, agricultural, social and human sciences, and agricultural engineering which will address the needs of the rural population;
12. We recommend introducing Occupational Health and Safety concerns in training and educational programmes in all of the abovementioned disciplines at any level, from health care providers to rural workers and population, in order to build the necessary human resources and to provide services of great quality to the rural population and agricultural workers. Specific country needs and participatory approach should be addressed;
13. We urge the agricultural sector to realize its responsibility for healthy working and housing conditions by expanding suitable measures for workers and farms and by providing financial means for scientific and educational developments to support such measures;
14. We are committed to share our practice and experience in devising, implementing and evaluating educational programs for the improvement of the health of the rural population;
15. We are committed, as citizens, to advocate peace and justice, and the pursuit of the common good as the founding of scientific and professional achievement in our own field of expertise;

ABSTRACT. To determine the appropriate method for isolating Salmonella enterica, we compared the growth of S. enterica serovars using three selective enrichment media. S. enterica was more successfully isolated from artificially contaminated fecal samples after enrichment in Hajna tetrathionate broth or modified semisolid Rappaport agar than in Rappaport broth. Since most bacteria (other than motile S. enterica) do not migrate on modified semisolid Rappaport agar, the growth characteristics of S. enterica can be interpreted easily and quickly. Two S. enterica isolates did not migrate on modified semisolid Rappaport agar, but did grow in Hajna tetrathionate broth, which suggests that the combined use of these selective enrichment media is appropriate for isolating S. enterica. KEY WORDS: modified semisolid Rappaport agar, Salmonella, selective enrichment medium
doi: 10.1292/jvms.15-0342; J. Vet. Med. Sci. 78(3): 435-438, 2016

Salmonella enterica is the most common foodborne disease worldwide as well as a diarrheal pathogen in livestock. Isolation of S. enterica from asymptomatic carrier animals can be used to assess microbial risk and to monitor the level of contamination in domestic animals. Although direct plating using selective media has been successful in isolating S. enterica strains, an enrichment step was necessary for enhancing the detection and isolation of the target pathogen [11]. A number of selective enrichment broth media are available, but relatively few studies have evaluated methods of bacterial isolation from fecal samples compared with food samples. Highly selective broth media with an enrichment step have been used to isolate target strains from contaminated samples [4]. Some reports have suggested that the high specificity and sensitivity of semisolid agar enhance S. enterica isolation [2, 6, 8, 13]. In this study, we investigated the growth kinetics of several S. enterica strains in two commercially available selective enrichment broth media and modified semisolid Rappaport agar (MSRA). MSRA is simple and inexpensive to prepare, and is similar in composition to commercially available modified semisolid Rappaport Vassiliadis agar. The present study determined the growth kinetics of twenty S. enterica serovars in three selective enrichment media to propose a rational method for isolation of S. enterica.
First, we determined bacterial growth ability in buffered peptone water (BPW), Hajna tetrathionate broth (HTTB) (Eiken, Tokyo, Japan), Rappaport broth (RB) (Eiken) and on MSRA. MSRA consists of casamino acid (5 g) and agar

(3 g) in a 50% concentration of RB (2.5 g of peptone, 4.0 g of NaCl, 0.8 g of KH2PO4, 10.15 g of MgCl2 and 0.06 g of malachite green) (1 l). As summarized in Table 1, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and 20 S. enterica serovars (25 strains) were used in this study. All bacterial strains were isolated from livestock in the Hokkaido prefecture from 2004 to 2013 and were identified using biochemical tests and/or S. enterica serotyping. Approximately 15,000 CFU of bacterial cells grown in BPW were inoculated in 5 ml of each broth and were incubated at 37°C. The culture was serially diluted and spread on MacConkey agar (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) plates to enumerate bacterial cell counts after 5 or 8 hr (logarithmic phase) and 24 hr (stationary phase). In addition, 3,000 CFU/10 µl of S. enterica were spotted on the MSRA. After a 24 hr incubation at 40°C, the migration zone diameters were measured. The results are shown in Table 1. Bacterial cell counts after the 5 hr incubation in BPW revealed a similar growth rate for each bacteria, except for the slow-growing S. Abortusequi. In contrast, after an 8 hr incubation in HTTB or RB, the bacteria showed varying periods of lag phase. After a 24 hr incubation, S. Abortusequi, S. Dublin and C. freundii had not grown in HTTB, RB or MSRA. S. Choleraesuis and E. cloacae did not grow in HTTB and RB, respectively. S. Uganda, S. Abortusequi, S. Dublin and C. freundii had decreased cell numbers after incubation in RB (less than 103 CFU/ml). Generally, host-adapted and host-restricted S. enterica were not well isolated after selective enrichment [1, 13]. Most of these serovars cause systemic infection and have lost some beneficial genes needed to grow in the intestinal lumen, such as tetrathionate utilization [3, 5, 12]. As a result, these serovars may have lost the ability to grow in HTTB. However, since Baggesen et al. reported that isolation rates of S. Dublin (at a concentration of 10 CFU/g feces) were 89.3% and 54.0% after selective enrichment on modified semisolid Rappaport Vassiliadis agar and in Mueller Kauffman tetrathionate broth, respectively [2], other

strains of these host adapted and restricted serovars may grow in HTTB, RB or on MSRA. In contrast, 16 S. enterica serovars grew in HTTB (107-8 CFU/ml), RB (106-7 CFU/ml) and MSRA (migrated 22.7->90 mm in diameter). Although colony formation was observed, the non-motile S. Derby did not migrate on MSRA. Interestingly, E. cloacae did not migrate on MSRA at 40°C, however, migration occurred at 37°C (46.0 ± 4.2 mm). The cost of maintenance of a flagellar motility system is high for bacteria, and the expression of the flagellar system is strictly regulated under stress conditions [14]. A higher incubation temperature may be necessary for enhancing selective methods.
Next, the efficacy of each selective enrichment medium for detection of S. enterica strains in fecal samples was investigated. Based on their growth in the selective enrichment media, the S. Livingstone (short period of lag phase), S. Typhimurium Ab-ty strain (long period of lag phase) and S. enterica serovar 4:i:- (S. 4:i:-) Hi-4i strain (less CFU in stationary phase) were used for further examination. Three of each type of fecal sample (bovine, swine and poultry) were artificially contaminated with 8-80,000 CFU/0.1 g of S. enterica and inoculated into 5 ml of HTTB and RB or on MSRA. After a 24 hr incubation at 37°C (HTTB and RB) or 40°C (MSRA), each culture was plated onto ES salmonellae agar II (Eiken) for S. enterica isolation. The number of posi-

tive test results in the three fecal samples is shown in Table 2. S. enterica detection limits were fewer in bovine feces than in swine and poultry feces. Compared with HTTB and MSRA, RB had lower isolation rates, especially in the case of the S. 4:i:- Hi-4i strain. On MSRA, it was possible to make "motile S. enterica negative" judgment easily, since the bacteria in the fecal samples had not migrated (Fig. 1). Moreover, the migration zone was pure S. enterica culture conditions, and the O-antigen was determined directly from the MSRA using S. enterica typing antisera (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) without subculture on isolation agar plates. Although inoculum volume was relevant to successful S. enterica isolation, and Harvey et al. recommended a small inoculum size in Rappaport broth and a larger size in selenite and tetrathionate broth [7], the sensitivity of MSRA is not restricted by inoculum volume since S. enterica attached to MSRA will spread from the samples and grow into the sterile area.
Finally, we examined the growth kinetics of cold-stressed S. Livingstone and S. Typhimurium Ab-ty strain with consideration for enhancing stress recovery increase S. enterica isolation from environmental samples [15]. Stress exposure was examined according to the method of Kim et al. [9] with slight modification. Briefly, S. enterica strains in mid-log phase were incubated in PBS at 4 or 25°C for 24 hr. Cold stress conditions resulted in approximately 1.5-log reduc-

tions in cell counts compared with those incubated at 37°C. Each culture was adjusted for cell counts, transferred into BPW, HTTB, RB and agar-free MSRA and incubated at 37°C (BPW, HTTB and RB) or 40°C (agar-free MSRA). After 15 hr (S. Livingstone) or 18 hr (S. Typhimurium Ab-ty strain) incubation, bacterial cell counts were determined by surface plating onto MacConkey agar plates. The migration zone diameter on MSRA was also measured after 24 hr incubation at 40°C. The data revealed that stress-exposed S. Livingstone showed the extended lag phase in HTTB, RB and MSRA (Table 3). S. Typhimurium Ab-ty strain appeared to require a longer time to enter the log phase of growth in RB. Stress exposed S. Typhimurium Ab-ty strain did not grow, even after 40 hr incubation, in RB (data not shown). This result, together with the faster growth in agar-free MSRA, revealed that MSRA will more effectively support growth of stressed S. enterica than HTTB or RB.
In conclusion, we documented the growth kinetics of S. enterica serovars in each selective enrichment medium and demonstrated proper culture methods for isolating S. enterica. Although conventional PCR, real-time PCR and enzyme immunoassays offer significant advantages over culture methods with respect to the rapidity and sensitivity of the detection of S. enterica strains [10, 11, 13], further investigation of bacterial isolation is necessary. MSRA showed some advantages including isolation sensitivity, earlier colony detection for serotyping and supporting the growth of stressed S. enterica. However, since some S. enterica strains did not grow or migrate on MSRA, but grew in HTTB, using multiple types of selective enrichment media, such as MSRA and HTTB together, is recommended to isolate S. enterica strains.

Heart failure (HF) is an important cardiovascular disease because of its increasing prevalence, significant morbidity, high mortality and rapidly expanding health care costs. The number of HF patients is increasing worldwide and Korea is no exception. Temporal trends of four representative Korean hospitalized HF registries-the Hallym HF study, the Korean Multicenter HF study, the Korean Heart Failure (KorHF) registry and the Korean Acute Heart Failure (KorAHF) registry showed mild survival improvement reflecting overall HF patient care development in Korea despite the increased severity of enrolled patients with higher incidence of multiple comorbidities. Moreover, device therapies such as implantable cardioverter defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy and definitive treatment such as heart transplantation have been increasing in Korea as well. To prevent HF burden increase, it is essential to set up long term effective prevention strategies for better control of ischemic heart disease, hypertension and diabetes, which might be risk factors for HF development. Moreover, proper HF guidelines, performance measures, and performance improvement programs might be necessary to limit HF burden as well. (Korean Circ J 2017;47(1):16-24)

Introduction
Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome characterized by typical symptoms and signs caused by structural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities.1) HF is an important cardiovascular disease due to its increasing prevalence, significant morbidity, high mortality and rapidly expanding health care costs. An HF diagnosis has previously been described as more `malignant' than cancer, given the comparatively low 5-year survival rates.2)3) In 1991, 5-year mortality from HF was 11% higher than the corresponding rates for gastrointestinal cancers.

stroke, and HF to be generally similar, with observed improvements in survival for all three diseases over the past decade.3)4)
The prevalence of HF is approximately 1-2% in the adult population in developed countries, rising to 10% among people >70 years of age.1) On the basis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2012, about 5.7 million (2.2%) people over the age of 20 years have HF and more than 550000 people are newly diagnosed with HF every year in the USA.5) By 2030, the prevalence of HF will increase 46%, resulting in more than 8 million people, and total medical costs for HF patients are expected to increase from $20.9 billion to $53.1 billion.5)6) In Japan, it is estimated that 1.0 million individuals have HF, and the number of Japanese outpatients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is predicted to gradually increase from 979000 in 2005 to 1.3 million by 2030.7) In Korea, the prevalence of HF increased approximately two times from 0.75% in 2002 to 1.53% in 2013, and is expected to increase by 2-fold again, from 1.60% in 2015 to 3.35% in 2040, when more than 1.7 million Koreans are expected to have HF.8)9)

hospitalization for acute heart failure (AHF) continues to increase in many countries.10-14) AHF refers to rapid HF onset or worsening of symptoms and/or signs. This is a life-threatening medical condition requiring urgent evaluation and treatment, typically leading to hospital admission.1) Estimates of the clinical characteristics, treatment, prognosis and temporal trends of HF hospitalization are central to our understanding of health-care utilization and to efforts to improve patient care and reduce health care costs. Therefore we aimed to investigate the temporal trends of four representative Korean hospitalized HF registries-the Hallym HF study, the Korean Multicenter HF study, the KorHF registry and the KorAHF registry. The Hallym HF study registry was a single university medical center, 4 affiliated hospital-based, retrospective cohort study of Korean hospitalized HF patients, between January 1987 and December 1997 (n=1657).15) The Korean Multicenter HF study registry was a nationwide, prospective, observational, multicenter registry from 9 university hospitals for hospitalized Korean HF patients, between January 1998 and August 2003 (n=1759).16) The KorHF registry was a nationwide, prospective, observational, multicenter registry from 24 academic hospitals for hospitalized Korean patients with AHF, between June 2004 and April 2009 (n=3200).17) The KorAHF registry was also a nationwide, prospective, observational, multicenter cohort registry from 10 tertiary university hospitals for hospitalized Korean patients with AHF between March 2011 and March 2014 (n=5625).18) Concomitant with the progress of these four Korean HF registries, the cornerstone of the Korean Society of Heart Failure (KSHF) has been laid firmly with various publications.15-31) Since 2003, KSHF has been Korea's leading academic organization dedicated to the study of heart failure. KSHF has promoted all aspects of research into heart failure, offered education for healthcare professionals, and provided forums where the expertise and experiences in heart failure research and treatment could be shared through periodical conferences, congresses, and symposiums.
In this review article we aimed to evaluate temporal trends seen in the four representative Korean HF registries, and focused on patient population characteristics, clinical status on admission, in-hospital management and clinical outcome. Because long term prognosis from the KorAHF registry are not available yet, we analyzed the KorAHF registry data from published interim analysis results (n=2066).18) We also briefly review the temporal trend for device therapies in Korea such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) as well as definitive treatment such as heart transplantation.
As shown in Table 1, the recent Korean HF registry patients were older, and had a higher incidence of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation and stroke compared with previous Korean HF registry populations. Ischemic etiology

was associated with a higher proportion of hospitalized HF patients, while hypertension as an HF etiology showed wide variation between different registries. Patients with more severe symptoms were enrolled in the recent registry and more patients underwent echocardiography during the index admission period. While the mean value of hemoglobin, serum sodium and creatinine were comparable between the KorHF and KorAHF registries, the proportion of patients with anemia, hyponatremia and azotemia increased (data not shown). Regarding in-hospital management, more frequent use of intravenous diuretics, inotropes, vasodilators, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy were noted in the recent period, reflecting increased HF severity in the patient population. The prescription rate for beta-blockers at discharge was lower in the KorAHF registry while that for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) was higher. Despite increased HF severity in enrolled patients, the recent registry showed mild improvement of in-hospital mortality indicating the overall development of hospitalized HF patient care in Korea.
Age
One of the outstanding findings in the comparisons between the four Korean hospitalized HF registries is the rapidly increasing mean age of the patient population (Fig. 1). HF is one of the major causes of death and hospitalization for elderly patients. The Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) sample cohort data showed that the prevalence of HF was 12.6% in subjects aged 80 years or older, while it was 1.0% and 5.5% in those aged 4059 years and 60-79 years, respectively. The prevalence of HF in subjects aged 80 years or older was approximately 8-fold higher than the overall prevalence of HF (1.53%).8) Age is an important prognostic factor in the Hallym HF registry, the Korean Multicenter HF study registry and KorHF registry as well.15-17) The KorAHF registry also showed that old age (70 years) was an independent predictor of post-discharge mortality.18) Data from other countries revealed that the overall number of hospitalizations for heart failure has increased, particularly in the aged population.11)13) With the aging of the general population, the epidemiologic burden of HF might increase substantially.
Comorbidities
Temporal trends in hospitalized HF patient comorbidities showed increasing prevalence of hypertension and diabetes (Fig. 2). The Korean

NHIS sample cohort data revealed that hypertension and diabetes were common in HF patients. The prevalence of hypertension as a comorbidity in hospitalized HF patients remained high, while diabetes was markedly increasing in 2013 compared to 2003 (hypertension 46.2%, and diabetes 33.4% in 2003; hypertension 43.6%, and

diabetes 49.1% in 2013, respectively).8) Data from Western Australia also revealed that hypertension and diabetes were the predominant comorbidities associated with HF and the prevalence of risk factors for HF, including hypertension, diabetes, renal failure, and atrial fibrillation, increased between 1990 and 2005, which along with

Asia, including China and Japan.7)8) Cardiomyopathy and valvular heart disease etiologies underlying
HF hospitalization showed consistent proportions during different time periods, while hypertension as an HF etiology showed wide variation between different registries. Hypertension as an HF etiology was significantly lower in the KorAHF registry compared to the other registries. This may result from different initial evaluation protocols in the KorAHF registry or the limited number of participating tertiary hospitals with higher rates of hypertension awareness, diagnosis and control.18) It is sometimes difficult to differentiate whether hypertension is merely an accompanying disease or an HF hospitalization etiology. It is necessary to more clearly define `hypertensive heart failure' in which uncontrolled hypertension at clinical presentation might result in decompensation in the absence of other identifiable causes.

aging population demographics provided a note of caution with respect to future population trends for HF.11)

Clinical outcomes and prognostic factors

Heart failure etiologies
Ischemic etiology is responsible for a high proportion of hospitalized HF cases, suggesting the need for better control of ischemic heart disease in order to reduce HF hospitalization (Fig. 3). The number of ischemic heart disease patients has increased due to the accelerated westernization of lifestyle in Korean people, and the number of survivors of an acute coronary syndrome has dramatically increased due to the development of interventional and medical progress in the general cardiovascular treatment. Recently, similar trends showing ischemia as the chief cause of HF were observed in

Even though the time point for survival analysis showed variation between the different registries, clinical outcomes showed mild improvement despite the increased HF severity in enrolled patients, reflecting the overall development of HF patient care in Korea (Fig. 4). In-hospital mortality was 5-8%, which is comparable to other registries. The cumulative Kaplan-Meier estimates for survival using 3 available previous registry data sets showed modest improvement in long term survival (Fig. 5). For the proper analysis of long term clinical outcomes, more detailed analysis such as propensity score matching might be necessary. However, it is common that temporal trends in clinical outcomes show mild or limited improvement irrespective of medical and surgical care

development for HF, because of the increased HF severity seen in enrolled patients.32)33) Independent prognostic factors from the four representative Korean hospitalized HF registries are summarized in Table 2.
Hyponatremia was an independent predictor of poor prognosis in the Hallym HF registry, the KorHF registry, the KorAHF registry and other Asian hospitalized HF registries.15)17)18)34)35) Data from the KorHF registry revealed that hyponatremia at admission was associated with higher all-cause mortality, irrespective of whether hyponatremia improved during hospitalization.20) A multivariate regression analysis of the KorAHF registry data also showed that hyponatremia at admission was an independent predictor of inhospital mortality and post-discharge mortality.18) Anemia is a well-known prognostic factor in patients with HF and is commonly observed in hospitalized HF patients. The KorHF registry showed that anemia on admission was an independent predictor for allcause mortality in hospitalized HF patients.17) Renal dysfunction is

one of the most important findings during hospitalization and a prognostic factor for hospitalized HF patients. The KorHF registry revealed that renal dysfunction was associated with poor clinical outcomes.17) A multivariate regression analysis of KorAHF registry data also showed that renal dysfunction at admission was one of the most important prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality and post-discharge mortality.18)
The cumulative survival curves for HF etiologies are shown in Fig. 6. The Hallym HF study revealed that HF caused by ischemic heart disease was associated with the poorest cumulative survival of 80.5% at 6 months, 30.2% at 5 years and 18.4% at 10 years, while HF caused by hypertensive heart disease predicted better survival with 90.8% at 6 months, 53.8% at 5 years and 31.1% at 10 years.15) These patterns were consistent with a subsequent Korean multicenter HF study as well. HF caused by ischemic heart disease showed the poorest cumulative survival with 79.4% at 6 months, 70.2% at 1 year and 59.7% at 2 years, while HF caused by valvular

heart disease was associated with better survival with 92.6% at 6 months, 91.0% at 1 year and 89.2% at 2 years followed by HF caused by cardiomyopathy and hypertensive heart disease16). However, long term survival of valvular heart disease patients in the Hallym HF study revealed a poor prognosis 7-9 years after index admission requiring close attention to these patients. HF etiology can be highly variable and many patients will have several comorbid pathologies that result in HF hospitalization. Identification of these diverse pathologies should be part of the diagnostic workup, as they may offer specific therapeutic opportunities.1)

are important issues in the management of hospitalized HF patients. Interruption of ACEi treatment was an independent prognostic factor in the Hallym HF registry, while beta-blocker prescription at discharge showed better clinical outcomes in the KorHF registry. When 1527 patients from the KorHF registry with left ventricular systolic dysfunction who survived hospitalization were evaluated, multivariate analysis revealed that adherence to ACE inhibitor treatment or ARB use at discharge were significantly associated with mortality and readmission at 60 days, and adherence to betablockers at discharge with mortality at 1 year.22)

In-hospital management
More frequent use of intravenous diuretics, inotropes, vasodilators, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy in the recent time period might result from the fact that patients with more severe symptoms and multiple comorbidities were enrolled in the recent registry. The advance of more active interventional treatment such as mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy and percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS) may be related to the improved in-hospital mortality in AHF patients. PCPS have been actively engaged in the acute care of patients with cardiogenic shock and are associated with clinical outcome improvement in Korea.36)
Guideline directed medical therapy and performance measures

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy in Korea
In Korea, device therapy for HF patients such as ICD and CRT has been underutilized because of cultural proscriptions, low HF awareness of patients and strict insurance coverage criteria. However, device therapy has recently increased steadily as shown in Fig. 7. To get real world data regarding the risks and benefits of device therapy for HF, and to clarify unmet needs for device therapy in Korean HF patients, it is necessary to establish a prospective nationwide HF device therapy registry near in the future.

Heart transplantation in Korea
In Korea, the first heart transplantation was performed at Asan medical center in 1992. The recipient was 51 years old at that time and is still alive after more than 23 years. By December 31st 2015, a total of 1136 heart transplants were done in Korea.37) Before 2000, annual heart transplants were less than 20, however transplants increased to more than 50 by 2007 and recently the annual number was over 120 (Fig. 8). A nationwide heart transplant cohort study under the Korean Organ Transplant Registry (KOTRY) since 2013 has been started. In Korea, unlike other Asian countries, where religious and social beliefs hinder organ donation, the number of heart transplants have increased steadily recent periods.37)38) However there is still a significant organ shortage even though organ donation is increasing in Korea, because there is a rapidly increasing number of end-stage HF patients requiring definitive treatment.
Accordingly, mechanical circulatory support devices, particularly continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly seen as an alternative to heart transplantation in North America and Europe. The number of patients with a permanent LVAD who are considered neither too old nor ineligible for transplantation is constantly growing. For a majority of these patients, lifelong LVAD therapy, despite eligibility for transplantation, has become a clinical reality.1) However, LVADs are not actively used in Korean end-stage HF patients' care, because of government regulation and insurance issues.

disease which are important risk factors for HF, is increasing.5-8) Patients in acute cardiovascular disease status will survive longer due to the development of advanced medical and surgical therapies, as well as accelerated aging of the general population, which will result in more patients at risk for developing HF.6) If increased HF burdens are to be avoided, the prevention of incident HF and proper guidelines for HF treatment are essential. Proper understanding of risk factors for HF is important to the development of preventive strategies. Demographic risk factors for the development of HF include older age, male gender, smoking, and obesity, while specific diseases such as ischemic heart disease, hypertension and diabetes also contribute significantly to the development of HF.6) Ischemic heart disease is still one of the most important risk factors for hospitalized HF in Korea and requires a special monitoring program. Hypertension is associated with a smaller relative risk for HF development than that associated with ischemic heart disease, but contributes more to overall HF burden because of its higher prevalence.6) The prevalence of diabetes as a comorbidity in Korean hospitalized HF patients is steadily increasing and it is well known that diabetes, insulin resistance, and obesity are also linked to HF development. To prevent increased HF burdens, it is essential to set up long term effective pre-emptive prevention strategies for better control of ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes which are risk factors for HF development.
Not only the prevention, but also the treatment of HF, can be improved through enhanced adherence to guideline directed management.6) In an effort to increase the use of evidence-based prevention and treatment approaches, the KSHF has produced Korean guidelines for the prevention and treatment of chronic HF in 2015, and for AHF in 2016. By facilitating measurements of cardiovascular healthcare quality, performance measures may serve as effective methods to accelerate appropriate translation of

scientific evidence into clinical practice.6) Performance improvement programs have facilitated the implementation of evidence-based therapies in both hospital and ambulatory care settings and it is well known that providing better levels of care based on performance measures are associated with better patient survival rates in patients with HF.6)22) Therefore, proper guidelines, performance measures, and performance improvement programs can have a substantial impact on cardiovascular prevention and treatment and will be important tools for limiting the burden of HF as well.
In summary, the temporal trends seen in four representative Korean HF registries-the Hallym HF study, the Korean Multicenter HF study, the KorHF registry and the KorAHF registry, showed mild improvement in HF mortality reflecting the overall development of AHF patient care in Korea despite the increased disease severity of enrolled patients including higher incidence of multiple comorbidities. To prevent increasing HF burdens, it is essential to set up long term effective pre-emptive prevention strategies for better control of ischemic heart disease, hypertension and diabetes, which might be risk factors for the development of HF. Moreover, proper HF guidelines, performance measures, and performance improvement programs are necessary to limit HF burden as well.

J uvenile dermatomyos itis (DM) is a multisystem disease characterized by nonsuppurative inflammation of striated muscle, skin and the gastrointestinal tract, and also characterized early in its course by an immune complex vasculitis and, later, the development of ca lcinosis1). Although the etiology of juve nile DM re ma ins unclear, it is suggested that IgE can be associated with autoimmune diseases, s uch as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and juvenile DM, by mediating the release of chemical mediators and by faciliating the local de position of immune complexes2 ). Inte rcurre nt infections with elevated serum IgE level during the course of the

disease give rise to problems in patients with juvenile DM. Atopic dermatitis, or development of calcinos is, may contribute to this proble m3 , 4 ). HIE also has the characteristic findings of recurrent infections of the skin and sinopulmonary tract and high serum IgE level. Other findings of HIE include eosinophilia, presence of anti- S.aureus specific IgE, defect of neutrophil chemotaxis, poor delayed hypersensitivity responses and ecze matoid de rmatitis5 ). He rein, we describe a patie nt with juvenile DM complicating HIE.

A 13- year- old girl was admitted to the hos pital because of multiple skin abscesses. Six years before admission, juvenile dermatomyositis was diagnosed at another hospital on the basis of symptoms of proximal muscle weakness, abnormal findings of muscle biopsy, elevated serum muscle enzyme and skin rash on her face. She had not been managed with regular follow- up. There was a history of recurrent skin infections,

pneumonia and eczematous dermatitis over the whole body after the diagnosis of juvenile dermatomyositis. She denied any history of allergic diseases. There was no family history of s pecific diseases. The temperature was 38.0¡ , the pulse was 116 and the res pirations were 24. The blood pressure was 90/50 mmHg. On physical examination, the skin of her entire body showed multiple hyperpigmented lesions, lichenoid patches and eczemaoid confluent plaques. Oral thrus h and subcutaneous cold abscesses of the left upper eye lid, back and right lower quadrant abdomen were found (Fig. 1). No lymphadenopathy was observed. The lungs were clear. Both knee joints had flexion contractures with muscle atrophy. The following laboratory findings were recorded: hemoglobin 10.5 gm/dl, white blood cell count 15,000/§§ (88,3 % neutrophils, 6.6 % lymphocytes, 3.5 % monocytes, 0.2 % eosinophils, 1.4 % basophils), platelet count 288,000/§§, erythrocyte sedimentaion rate 68mm/hour (Westergren method), The protein was 6.7 g/dl (albumin 3.2 g/dl; globulin 3.5 g/dl). The values for glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, aldolase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potasium, chloride and magnesium were normal. Urine analys is was normal except for proteinuria(+). Levels of C3, C4 and CH50 were normal. The tests for antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, VDRL, hepatitis surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody and C- reactive protein were negative. Antibodies to Sm, RNP, Ro, La, Jo- 1 and ds DNA were not detected. Serum immunoglobulin examination revealed normal IgG ( 1,970 mg/dl; normal 800- 1,500 mg/dl ), IgM ( 111 mg/dl; normal 45- 150 mg/dl ), elevated IgA ( 455 mg/dl; normal 90- 325 mg/dl ) and IgE (6,650 mg/dl; normal <200 mg/dl ).

All sa mples we re assayed in duplicate .
Follow- up serum IgE levels decreased with the treatment of S. aureus infection, but still remained high ( 3,180 mg/dl, 3,120 mg/dl). Immunoelectrophoresis of serum revealed no evidence of paraproteinemia. Radiographs of the abdomen and both lower extremities s howed multiple soft tissue calcifications . EMG and muscle biopsy findings were compatible with inflammatory myopathy ( Fig. 2 ). Antibodies to S. aureus of the IgE class were detected by direct ELISA method, as previously described, with some modifications6 ) ( Fig. 3 ).

and proteus was negative. Radioallergosorbent tests to common allergens were negative except for Penicillium notatum. Bacteriologic cultures from skin abscesses were positive for S. aureus . Cultures from oral mucous lesion grew Candida albicans . The total numbers of T cells , T cell subpopulations (CD4+/CD8+) were within normal limits . The Nitroblue- Tetrazolium- test was normal. In vitro lymphocyte proliferation was normal exposure to nonspecific antigens (phytohemagglutinin, phorbol myristate acetate plus ionomycin). The polymorphonuclear leukocyte motility, assessed in a reversible Boyden chamber with fmet- leu- phe and patient's serum as che mo- attracta nts, as prevoiusly described5 ), was impaired. She was successfully managed with surgical drainage and antibiotics.
DIS C US S IO N
Some diseases, including chronic granulomatous disease, Wiskott- Aldrich syndrome, icthyosis vulgaris, severe combined immunodeficiency and HIE, have similiar clinica l findings of recurre nt s kin infections7 ). This patient was diagnosed as having HIE on the basis of recurrent infections of skin and pulmonary, extremely elevated levels of serum IgE and presence of anti- S.aureus specific IgE, chemotactic defect of neutrophile, eczematoid dermatitis and normal nitroblue tetrazolium test. The late onset of her recurrent infection and normal eos inophil count were atypical. But these have bee n obse rved in othe r re ports5 ). S.aureus a nd C. ablicans were isolated from skin cold abscesses and oral cavity, respectively, in this case. These organis ms are known to be most predominant pathogens in recurrent infections of HIE5 ). S. aureus infection with elevated serum IgE is rarely observed in juvenile DM, and this can be partially explained by the previous two reports. First, atopic dermatitis, which is frequently accompanied by S. aureus, has a higher tendency for developing juvenile DM3 ). Second, the deve lopme nt of ca lcinos is a nd granulocyte chemotactic defect in juvenile DM is associated with sta phylococca l infections4 ). The ca uses of recurrent skin infections of S. aureus in this patient are pres umed to have a somewhat different mechanism from those two. Hochreutener et al suggested that increased S. aureus specific IgE level, decreased S. aureus specific IgA level, diminished chemotaxis and soft tissue abscesses can be differential points between atopic dermatitis and HIE, but chemotactic defect and

anti- S.aureus specific IgE were found to be not only HIE but a lso atopic de rmatitis8 , 9 ). So, sometimes , it may be hard to differentiate HIE from atopic dermatitis in a patient with juvenile DM who has elevated IgE level and S.aureus infection. Differential diagnosis is important because treatment and prognosis is different. Atopic dermatitis does not have recurrent infections of the s inopulmonary tracts and peculiar cold abscesses and has a dermatitis that differs in character and distribution from lesions of HIE5 ). This patie nt denied any history of allergy, and RAST(radioallergosorbent test) to common allergens, except for Penicillium notatum, were negative. Moore et al emphasized the relationship between the development of calcinosis and recurrent staphylococcal infections with raised IgE in juve nile DM4 ). Although the level of serum IgE in Moore's cases are elevated, most of them do not meet the definition of HIE (¡^ 2,000 IU/ml). But this patient had extremely elevated IgE level (6,600 IU/ml) during infection and had constantly raised serum IgE levels (¡^ 3,000 IU/ml) during follow- up. Anti- S.aureus s pecific IgE was detected only during S. aureus infection in this case. Calcinosis occurs commonly with scleroderma, as well as dermatomyositis , and rarely in association with SLE10). HIE has bee n ra rely re ported in patie nts with S LE11- 13 ), but these cases had no association with calcinosis. Calcinosis develops in up to ha lf the patie nts with juve nile de rmatomyositis1). It must be clarified whether recurrent skin infection with elevated IgE occurs in most juvenile DM patients with calcinosis or not. Although the immunologic bas is of elevated serum IgE in patients with HIE has not been defined, a deficie ncy of suppressor T ce ll to inhibit IgE production5 ), imbalances between IL- 4 producing and IFN- ¥ª producing he lpe r T ce lls14 ) a nd decreased meta bolism of IgE15 ) see m to be respons ible for e levated leve ls of IgE. The re we re re ports that CD8+ to CD4+ ratio was reduced in a patie nt with juve nile DM16 ). But this was not found in our case. The causes of susceptibility to infections have not been documented. Schopfer et al suggest that histamine is released on crosslinkng of mast cell- bound antistaphylococcal IgE by staphylococcal antigens and interferes with the activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, resulting in the failure of effective S. aureus clea ring17 ). It is known that there is varia bility in both HIE and juvenile DM patient's neutrophil and monocyte che motaxis5 ). Whethe r the neutrophils were intrinsica lly abnormal or not was inconclusive in a patient with HIE, but chemotactic defect of neutrophil to fmet- leu- phe and

97

patient's serum as chemo- attractants was observed in this case. HIE has significantly lower proportions of circulating T cells that can produce IFN- ¥ª and TNF- ¥Æ, in comparison with normal controls, which also may contribute to recurrent infections14). In conclusion, simila r findings, including elevated serum IgE, anti- S.aureus IgE and chemotactic defect of neutrophil, can be found in patients with HIE, juvenile DM and atopic dermatitis . HIE must be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient with juvenile DM who has an elevated level of IgE and staphylococcus aureus skin infection. It will be interesting to define whether the underlying mechanism is the same or not in these diseases.

Purpose: The promotion of educators is challenged by the lack of accepted standards to evaluate the quality and impact of educational activities. Traditionally, promotion is related to research productivity. This study developed an evaluation tool for educational performance of medical school faculty using educator portfolios (EPs). Methods: Design principles and quantitative items for EPs were developed in a consensus workshop. These principles were tested in a simulation and revised based on feedback. The changes of total educational activities following introduction of the system were analyzed. Results: A total of 71% faculty members answered the simulation of the system and the score distributed widely (mean±standard deviation, 65.43±68.64). The introduction of new system significantly increased the total educational activities, especially in assistant professors. Conclusion: The authors offer comprehensive and practical tool for enhancing educational participation of faculty members. Further research for development of qualitative evaluation systems is needed.
Key Words: Educator portfolio, Faculty evaluation, Medical education

Introduction
Traditionally, the role of medical school faculty was compared to a three-legged stool, with the legs as education, research, and practice. This comparison implies medical school faculties achieve balance in the three parts of their duty. Today, this comparison has changed to a tricycle with oversized front. Intense competition between the roles of clinical practice and research had pressed medical school faculty members. Affiliated hospitals are seeking profits, clinical pro-

fessors are focused on clinical practice, and universities are pressing professors to produce research product such as "SCI" journals. This is reflected by the fact that the faculty evaluation system is focused on research activities, leading many professors to set a low priority on their role as educators [1,2,3]. This situation is no different in Korea [4,5].
A reliable system to evaluate faculty based on their educational activities is needed to improve recruitment and retention of high-quality educators [1,6] and achieve the unique mission of educating physicians [7,8]. While the evaluation of research activities has well designed

Hong Bin Kim, et al : Educational performance evaluation
and acceptable standards, evaluating educational performance is still unsatisfactory in spite of recent efforts to develop effective assessment tools in this area [4,5,9,10,11,12]. To encourage medical school faculty to maintain a balance between research activity and educational activity, a reasonable evaluation system for educational performance is necessary.
In this study, we developed a new system for evaluating educational activity as part of the promotion and tenure process, with the goal of increasing participation in educational activities and raising individual investment in faculty's role in education.
Subjects and methods
The new evaluating system was developed and applied to all professors at the Seoul National University College of Medicine (SNUCM).
1. The overview of the process
The 2011 SNUCM task force team on educator evaluation was convened to develop an objective process for evaluating educational performance. The task force team includes 15 faculty members from various fields including medical education, internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, psychiatry, neurology, otolaryngology, ophthalmology, dermatology, diagnostic radiology, neurosurgery, anesthesiology, anatomy, and forensic medicine. The task force team agreed to use educator portfolio (EP). The typical curriculum vitae (CV) reflect quantifiable data (numbers of papers and grants, grant dollars). In contrast, many important aspects of educational activity are not quantifiable and require alternative evaluation measures.

2. The principles of developing new evaluation system
Through consensus workshop, the task force team worked to develop a reliable evaluation system using clear items with appropriate and fair weighted value for each item. They focused on five guiding principles: (1) the new system should reinforce a professor's role as educator; (2) special regard should be paid to the individual characteristics of each professor and differences among affiliated departments; (3) professors should be encouraged to meet with students individually for mentoring and counseling; (4) evaluation items should be diverse and clear, eliminating any ambiguity; (5) reliable and definite score differences should reflect faculty members' efforts and the outcomes of educational activity.
3. New evaluation system for educational performance
The evaluation system was designed based on the time and efforts devoted to each educational activity (Table 1). The items were proposed as measurable educational activities and were divided into three categories: teaching & learner assessment, educational leadership/administration & curriculum, and advising/mentoring. These were rearranged from five categories which were previously described for documenting quantity and quality of scholarly engagement in educational activities: teaching, curriculum, advising/mentoring, educational leadership/administration, and learner assessment [11]. The requirement of educational scores for promotion escalated with promotion of the position.
4. Development of quantitative items
The various educational activities were proposed as items for evaluation system. Over the course of developing and selecting items for the evaluation tool, items

were revised based on group discussion. We then developed a scoring system to measure each activity, using the educational activity of 1-hour lecture as a basic unit for scoring. Each item was weighted based on the educator's effort and time spent.
Before applying the new evaluation system, each professor documented their educational activities in 2011 and calculated their score. We got feedback from faculty members on feasibility and applicability of the new evaluation system.
5. Outcome measure: educational activities
All professors at SNUCM were asked to describe their educational activities using new evaluation system between 2011 and 2013, encompassing the time before (2011 and 2012) and after (2013) the introduction of the new evaluation system. We then calculated the changes in their total educational activities following intro-

duction of the system.
6. Data analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 20.0 statistical package (IBM Corp., Armonk, USA). The changes in educational activities of professors were analyzed using analysis of covariance. The pvalues of <0.05 were taken to indicate significant differences.
7. Ethical consideration
The SNUCM Institutional Review Board provided study approval and waived the requirement for written consent.

Results
1. Results of simulation
A total of 190 faculty members (71%) participated in the simulation of the system. The scores of faculty members were widely distributed (mean±standard deviation [SD], 65.43±68.64). The scores of lecture, basic experiment practice and clinical training showed a particularly wide disparity (mean±SD, 17.46±36.63, 12.8±43.95, and 14.04±33.70, respectively) with a standard deviation higher than average score and these activities were main educational activities of faculties. The sum of scores from lecture, basic experiment and clinical training was 67.7% of total educational scores (mean±SD, 44.3±50.4).
2. Changes of total educational activities of professors following introduction of new system
One of the primary goals in developing new evaluation system for educational performance is to encourage

professor's participation in educational activities. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the total of educational activities was significantly increased following introduction of new system (p<0.001). Score increase in educational leadership/administration & curriculum was significantly higher than increases in other categories of educational activities (p<0.001). The increase of assistant professor's educational activity was significantly higher than that of associate professor or professor (p=0.045). There was no significant difference in scores across different affiliated hospitals (p=0.571).
Discussion
In this study, we present the development of a novel tool for evaluating educational activity. Our goal was to provide an instrument that would encourage promotions committees to consider recognize and reward medical educators based on educational activity.
EPs are now used in addition to or in combination with CVs in many institutions to evaluate educators [12]. EPs are very informative and medical schools which are

using EP documentation in their promotion dossier are enormously increased [12].
In this study, despite our efforts to develop clear and detailed guidelines for scoring, some rated items were ambiguous. The diversity of educational activities available made it difficult to establish clear-cut and consistent scoring criteria. Furthermore, educational activities are constantly evolving, making it challenging to evaluate them based on fixed items. Evaluation items must be frequently re-evaluated and updated based on new developments in the field.
The scores of lecture, basic experiment practice and clinical training showed a particularly wide disparity and these might result from the inequity of chance for lecture, basic experiment practice and clinical training among affiliated departments. Therefore, the task force team decided to establish an upper limit of scores to reduce any possible bias in evaluating lecture and clinical training.
As shown in the results, the educational activities of faculties are still primarily lecture, basic experiment or clinical training oriented (67.7%). These might result from faculty members' unfamiliarity with alternative educational activities such as small group teaching.
Recently, many medical schools favored small group activities in place of larger lectures and the importance of tailored guidance for students was amplified. This has increased the need for effective and committed clinician educators [8,13]. We hope that our new evaluation system will function as an inducement for educational activities.
One obstacle to implementation of our new evaluation system is faculty's unfamiliarity with keeping EPs. Despite our straightforward web-based EP system, faculties still reported discomfort with keeping EPs. For a valid and reliable evaluation system, faculties must document their work meticulously. The quality of

Hong Bin Kim, et al : Educational performance evaluation
evaluation tool is fully dependent on the quality of each faculty's EP.
Our study has several limitations. First, as mentioned above, in this early stage of the evaluation we relied upon quantitative data. After the system is more fully established, we hope to create a more qualitative approach. Second, the evaluation system was developed based on consensus workshop. A continuous review and modification of the system is required to ensure that items and scores are adequate for evaluation educational activities and progress. Third, the evaluation system is primarily designed for promotion and tenure process. Senior professors who are exempt from this evaluation system are not affected by this system and have no incentive to participate. This may explain the fact that score increase was particularly significant in assistant professors.
We hope that our study will trigger productive debate that will lead to a consensus on educator evaluation and EP standards. Medical educators deserve a professional environment in which their efforts are valued and rewarded.
Our evaluation system for educational activities significantly increased faculty's participation in educational activities. Further research should focus on upgrading and expanding the evaluation system.

ABSTRACT
Objective: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (VP) has been used for the safe treatment of osteoporotic compression fracture. However, cement leakage is the most common complication. To reduce the leakage of bone cement, we did the gelfoam embolization during VP. The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and feasibility of different two gelfoam embolization technique during VP. Methods: Total 127 patients (146 level) who had the thoracolumbar osteoporotic compression fracture were enrolled. Group A was treated by gelfoam-only technique and, Group B was treated by gelfoam with venography technique. We compared the incidence of bone cement leakage between two groups using post-operative computed tomography scan and X-ray. Results: Seventy-four patients (81 levels) were treated with gelfoam-only technique (A), and 53 patients (65 levels) were treated with gelfoam with venography technique (B). There were 22 leakages on group A, and 19 leakages on group B. There was no statistical significant difference between two groups (Chi-square test, p-value =0.958). Incidence of leakage to spinal canal was 11 levels in Group A, 3 levels in group B, and there was statistical significant difference (Fisher's exact test, p-value=0.027). Conclusion: Complication induced by the bone cement leakage are the most careful point during VP. Gelfoam embolization with venography is very easy and safe method. Gelfoam with venography technique could make lower the incidence of cement leakage to spinal canal.

INTRODUCTION
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (VP) has been widely used for pain relief and strengthening of weakened vertebral bodies for osteoporotic compression fracture.6) However, the VP has the potential risk of serious complications such as infection, new fractures of the adjacent vertebral body and cardiopulmonary complications. Especially, leakage of cement after VP is one of the most serious complication and it has been reported between 38% and 75%.3-6,12,16) To prevent this complication, the technique using gelfoam during VP has been reported. Although gelfoam technique could reduce the cement leakage, it still remains one of the major problems of vertebroplasty. Techniques to reduce these complications more effectively have been

studied include the intraosseous venography during VP.2,13,14) We developed the technique for venography before VP by mixing contrast and gelfoam to avoid cement leakage via intravertebral venous flow or facture line. There had been no reports comparing gelfoam only technique and gelfoam with venography technique. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and feasibility of routine pre-injection of gelfoam with venography during VP.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients who underwent VP for painful osteoporotic thoracolumbar compression fracture by single surgeon form 2011 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 127 patients (146 levels) enrolled in this study.
Fractured levels were selected from the 9th thoracic spine to the 5th lumbar spine. All had suffered the severe back pain and tenderness for more than 2 weeks which did not respond to conservative treatment. The level of VP was selected on the basis of clinical symptom, magnetic resonance image, and radioisotope bone scan. We divided the groups: (A) gelfoam only technique group, (B) gelfoam with venography group. In 2011 to 2013, we used gelfoam only technique during VP. After that time, we developed gelfoam with venography technique, and newly developed technique was used from 2013 to 2015.
All procedures were performed as elective schedule under local anesthesia by only one experienced spinal neurosurgeon. After placing the patient in the prone position on the radiolucent table, the back was prepared and draped. Under the biplane C-am guided, the Jamshidi needle was introduced through the pedicle and advanced to the anterior third of the vertebral body to prevent the fenestration of anterior cortex. All procedures were performed via bipedicular approach.
In group A, the gelfoam sponge was cut into regular shape (5×5 mm). The gelfoam pieces were mixed with the 10 mL of normal saline using 10-mL syringe. And then, pre-procedural gelfoam embolization was performed without contrast using 5 mL of gelfoam on each side. After 1 minute, 1.5 mL of bone cement was injected per one Jamshidi needle (total 3 cc per level).
In group B, the pieces of gelfoam sponge was mixed with 3 mL of normal saline and 7 mL of contrast (Vispaque-320) using 10-mL syringe. And 5 mL of pre-procedural gelfoam embolization with contrast was performed on each side (FIGURE 1). Venography was done to identify the basivertebral plexus and any other large vessels or fracture line which the cement might leak. If there was an active venous flow or contrast leakage, we advanced the Jamshidi neelde a litte more (FIGURE 2). After 1 minute, 1.5 mL of vertebroplasty cement was injected per one Jamshidi needle (total 3 cc per level).
During bone cement injection, the C-arm was used to confirm whether there was any cement leakage. If any signs of cement leakage were suspected, the injection was stopped immediately, and injection was performed again after 1 minute waiting. If it was suspected that there was cement leakage along the vein according to the venography, we advance the Jamshidi needle a little and reinject the bone cement after 1 minute waiting. After the procedure, cement leakage was assessed using postoperative plain radiography and computed tomography (CT) scan. Based on obtained images, we classified cement leakage into 4 patterns: type 1 to the paravertebral muscle and soft tissue, type 2 to the paravertebral vein, type 3 to the disc space, type 4 to the spinal canal (FIGURE 3).14)

All statistical analysis were performed using SPSS ver. 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). T-test, chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical analysis. Statistical significance was accepted for p<0.05.

RESULTS
On this study, we classified into two groups; group A (gelfoam only technique) were 81 levels and group B (gelfoam with venography technique) were 65 levels. Group A consisted of 74 patients (54 females and 20 males); average age was 71 years (40-86). All patients had the severe osteoporosis (average bone mineral density [BMD] -3.1). Group B consisted of 53 patients (42 females and 11 males); average age was 73 years (46-95); those had also severe osteoporosis (average BMD -3.2). There was no statistical significance difference between two groups in patient demographics (TABLE 1). In comparison of cement leakage incidence, there were 22 leakages on group A, and 19 leakages on group B. There was no statistical significant difference between two groups in comparison of overall leakage incidence (Chi-

DISCUSSION
Leakage of cement after VP has been reported between 38% to 75%.1,3-6) Yeom et al.17) reported that leakage incidence was 76.3%, and Schmidt et al.15) found 29 leakage in 26 level. [REMOVED HYPERLINK FIELD][REMOVED HYPERLINK FIELD] The leakage can lead to severe neurological or pulmonary complications.9,10) It has been reported that the gelfoam embolization technique could reduce cement leakage.1) Since our hospital had been started the pre-procedural gelfoam embolization during VP, the leakage was markedly reduced. However, concerns about the risk of potential bone cement leakage still remain for young spine neurosurgeon.

Although controversy has existed, venography before VP is known as one of an effective method. If surgeon know venography pattern in advance, it would be helpful to prevent the cement leakage complication by controlling the needle tip position or cement amount. In addition, the agreement rate between the pattern of venography and cement leakage has been reported to be 83%.13)

We studied of the incidence and pattern of bone cement leakage between groups which were performed gelfoam technique during VP with or without venography.

The leakage patterns of bone cement classified by many author were useful to decrease the complication.11) In this study, we classified the cement leakage pattern into four types. This four types were divided based on the direction of leakage and related structures. Type 1 is in case of leakage to the paravertebral muscle and soft tissue, type 2 is considered when cement leaks to paravertebral vessels, type 3 and 4 are classified when cement leaks to disc space and spinal canal. All patterns were decided using postoperative CT and X-ray by one neurosurgeon who performed the operation.

Overall incidence of cement leakage showed no significant difference between two groups. However, incidence of cement leakage to spinal canal (type 4) in gelfoam with venography group is low compared with gelfoam only group. One of most catastrophic complication of VP is induced by leakage type 4 (migraine to spinal canal). As leakage to spinal canal might cause serious complications like paraplegia or radiculopathy, gelfoam with venography technique could help to avoid leakage to spinal canal for young spine neurosurgeon. Gelfoam

Gelfoam Embolization with Venography

slows the injected cement and venous flow, and it could reduce the cement leakage to the spinal canal. And, it is possible to further reduce leakage incidence to the spinal canal by confirming whether there is a contrast leak through venography.
Our study have some limitations; First, all VPs were performed by only one surgeon who experienced more than 500 VP cases. Because VP is not a difficult surgery, surgeons familiar enough with VP has many experience to reduce the leakage of bone cement, so the overall leakage incidence may show no significant difference. If operations was performed by the beginner, the results would have been different. In general, experienced spine neurosurgeon have only below 2% complication rate of VP.7,8) Second, in this study, it was confirmed that the risk of cement leakage to the spinal canal can be reduced by performing venography during VP, but cement leakage that cannot be predicted by venography also exists. Intraoperative venography could confirm not only the large venous flow in the vertebral body, but also large fracture line where contrast can reach. However, the fracture line of the part where the contrast medium did not reach is not entirely certain by venography alone, but it can be known and avoided through preoperative CT scan.
Third, the total number of VP procedures is small. We limited on the T9-L5 spine level and only one neurosurgeon for the high degree of accuracy of study. Further study might be needed.

CONCLUSION
In our study, there was no statistical significant difference between gelfoam groups which applied venography or not. But gelfoam with venography make lower the incidence of cement leakage to spinal canal. This study has limitation that all this procedure was performed by only one skillful neurosurgeon and the bone cement leakage during VP will be higher from unexperienced operator. Therefore, the gelfoam with venography technique could be helpful for beginners.

Abstract: The goal of cost-effective production of fuels and chemicals from biomass has been a substantial driver of the development
of the field of metabolic engineering. The resulting design principles and procedures provide a guide for the development of costeffective methods for degradation, and possibly even valorization, of plastic wastes. Here, we highlight these parallels, using the creative work of Lonnie O'Neal (Neal) Ingram in enabling production of fuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass, with a focus on ethanol production as an exemplar process.
Keywords: Plastic valorization, plastic degradation, process design, metabolic engineering, hybrid processing

Introduction
The invention of vulcanized rubber in 1893 opened the doors for the development of synthetic polymers (Barker, 1940). The versatility in polymer types and blends allows diverse applications ranging from household goods to medical equipment and singleuse supplies (Andrady & Neal, 2009). Currently, most plastic polymers are derived from petrochemicals in processes designed to produce stable, durable materials. This stability to various abiotic and biotic processes results in the accumulation of synthetic plastic polymers in the environment, including microplastics (Sharma & Chatterjee, 2017). The global production of plastic continues to increase (Elhacham et al., 2020) and much of this plastic waste ends up in landfills and water bodies (Law et al., 2020). Various studies have shown that approximately 80 wt% of the debris collected from the ocean floor is plastic (Selvam et al., 2021). Thus, there is a need for the development of processes that reuse, recycle or repurpose these materials (Lau et al., 2020).
Here, we focus on biologically mediated repurposing of these materials (Fig. 1). Ongoing efforts to improve chemical and thermal-based processes are described elsewhere (Liu et al., 2021; Monsigny et al., 2018; Padhan & Sreeram, 2019; Qureshi et al., 2020; Rahimi & Garcia, 2017; Vollmer et al., 2020). It has also been demonstrated that plastic monomers traditionally derived from petroleum can be produced by engineered microbes (Karp et al., 2017) and plants (Hillmyer, 2017; Rasutis et al., 2015).
The environmental accumulation of carbon-rich plastics due to an insufficient biological sink is reminiscent of the carbonaceous period in which lignin production drastically outpaced its biodegradation, and much of this lignin still exists in the form of coal and shale oil deposits (Robinson, 1990). This leads to the intriguing premise that petroleum-derived plastics are ultimately derived from lignin and this novel biological functionality that arose 300 million years ago is still wreaking havoc, but this question is beyond the scope of this review. Persistence of lignocellulosic biomass in the environment is no longer a problem and it is actually an appealing source of carbon and energy for the mi-

crobial production of fuels and chemicals. The continued progress in the engineering of microbes for utilization and valorization of biomass makes them a tantalizing candidate for addressing the plastic waste problem.
The challenges of developing microbial cell factories that can degrade, or even valorize plastic waste in an economically viable process parallels the challenge of developing microbial cell factories for the valorization of lignocellulosic biomass (Fig. 2). The topic of microbial degradation, and possibly valorization, of plastic waste has been repeatedly reviewed elsewhere, as described below. Here, we highlight the parallels between plastic utilization and biomass utilization, with a focus on Lonnie O. Ingram's extensive body of work related to biomass valorization.
Biomass and Plastic Waste Are Both Heterogenous Biomass Composition
In contrast to virgin plastics, biomass is inherently heterogeneous. The three major components of lignocellulosic biomass are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Cellulose and hemicellulose are biological polymers, each consisting of repeating monomeric units of hexose and pentose sugars, respectively. Lignin is a heteropolymer of the phenylpropanoid monomers guaiacyl (G type), syringyl (S type), and p-hydroxyphenyl (H type) (Davis et al., 2016). Biomass also contains less abundant metabolic components, such as nucleic acids, proteins, pigments and waxes, referred to in some contexts as non-structural components or extractives (Airoldi et al., 2019; de Araujo Silva et al., 2021; Horhammer et al., 2018).
Biomass composition varies substantially according to species (Chi et al., 2019), but is also impacted by growth conditions (Dennison et al., 2019; Templeton et al., 2009) and storage conditions (Smith et al., 2020; Towey et al., 2019; Wendt & Zhao, 2020) of the harvested biomass. Similar to the challenge of contaminants in mixed plastic wastes, harvested biomass often contains sand and soil, the presence of which can negatively impact biomass

hydrolysis, often requiring the addition of a process step for their removal (Horhammer et al., 2018).
Plastic Composition
Some of the common polymers in plastic waste include polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinylchloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS). Any process that aims to degrade or valorize plastic waste needs to be capable not only of utilizing the polymeric materials, but it must also be robust to the heterogenous nature of plastic waste, both in terms of the type of plastic, but also the presence of various impurities. Commercially available flakes of recycled PP were found to contain roughly 4% PE and 1-4% of a combination of PET, PS and PVC, as well as small amounts of textiles, aluminum and paper (Alvarado

Charcon et al., 2020). The same analysis determined that recycled PE flakes contained roughly 5% PP and 1-4% other plastics.
PE is produced as either high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and is used in plastic bottles, shopping bags, packaging, toys and household items (Andrady & Neal, 2009; Rahimi & Garcia, 2017). LDPE's recalcitrance to degradation is demonstrated by the fact that it took more than 30 years for a buried PE sheet to attain measurable levels of degradation and weight reduction (Otake et al., 1995). PET's backbone linkage of ester bonds provides high stability (Kawai et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). It is a strong and durable semi-crystalline thermoplastic polyester representing almost 50% of the world's synthetic fiber production (Crippa & Morico, 2020). PET has been used for the production of beverage containers, electronics and textile fibers (Webb et al., 2013). PET is commonly reused rather than

recycling, and with every use, the quality of polymer degrades. PVC is commonly used in the production of bottles, shoe soles, pipes and plastic cards. PP is a polymer of repeating units of propane-1,2-diyl, with applications in packaging, and medical, industrial and domestic utilization (Arutchelvi et al., 2008; Shah et al., 2008). PS is used not only in the packaging industry but also in daily consumables.
In addition to the plastic polymer, plastic often contains additives (such as dyes). Mixed plastic waste often contains other components (such as silica and glass), residual food and dirt (Andrady & Neal, 2009). Some of this material can be removed with a pretreatment step such as washing, though these contribute to the overall process cost. Plastics have been repeatedly described as comprising roughly 10% of household waste (Mathioudakis et al., 2021; Noufal et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2014). In European municipal solid waste, PE (HDPE and LDPE) was the most abundant plastic, followed by PP, PET and PS (Dahlbo et al., 2018; Moellnitz et al., 2020). Commercial waste contained less PP than municipal waste, but all other polymers were roughly equivalent (author's own calculations from Moellnitz et al., (2020)). One study found that European commercial and municipal waste each contain roughly 1% PVC and PS, and 2% PP, with commercial waste containing 8% PE and municipal waste containing 5% PE (author's own calculations from Moellnitz et al., (2020)). Plastic waste from the western North Atlantic Ocean appeared to be highly enriched for HDPE, with some LDPE and PP, while the corresponding beach waste consisted mainly of PP and LDPE, with some HDPE, PS, PV and PET (Moret-Ferguson et al., 2010).
Direct Biological Utilization of Biomass and Plastic Biomass
The fact that cellulose is a polymer of the hexose sugars generally preferred by microbes has motivated extensive work with cellulolytic organisms and cellulase enzymes. In the context of microbial cell factories, there are two general options for biological depolymerization of cellulose: use of an organism that is capable of producing its own cellulase enzymes, or exogenous provisioning of cellulase enzymes that were either purchased or produced in a distinct process step. Commercially available cellulase enzymes have often been subjected to extensive protein engineering to improve performance metrics (Chandel et al., 2012).
Microbial species that are inherently cellulolytic often require genetic modification to achieve production of the desired target molecule. For example, metabolic engineering of cellulolytic Caldicellulosiruptor bescii for expression of the ethanol production pathway resulted in the conversion of filter paper (cellulose) and switchgrass to ethanol (Chung et al., 2014). The Ingram group engineered two species with inherent cellobiose depolymerization capacity for the production of ethanol: the soft-rot bacteria Erwinia (Beall & Ingram, 1993) and the soil bacteria Klebsiella oxytoca, abundant in cellulosic waste streams (Doran et al., 1994).
A parallel approach is to modify the production organism so that it is able to depolymerize cellulose and its subunits (Davison et al., 2020). The Ingram group used several iterations of this approach. Escherichia coli strains that had previously been engineered for ethanol production were further modified to express cellobiose phosphotransferase from Bacillus stearothermophilus (Lai & Ingram, 1993), cellobiose-depolymerization enzymes from K. oxytoca (Moniruzzaman et al., 1997), and endoglucanase enzymes from Erwinia chrysanthemi (Wood, Beall, et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 1999). As described above, K. oxytoca was engineered for ethanol

production. The native cellobiose-depolymerization activity of this organism was expanded by expression of cellulase from Clostridium thermocellum (Wood & Ingram, 1992), and E. chrysanthemi endoglucanase (Zhou & Ingram, 1999; Zhou & Ingram, 2001). Ultimately, the Ingram group shifted to the use of abiotic biomass depolymerization in conjunction with commercial enzyme supplementation, as described below.
The pentose sugars comprising hemicellulose are generally less preferred by microbes relative to hexose sugars, and yet valorization of these molecules is key to the economic viability of a biorefinery. The Ingram group used a grass-fed anaerobic digester as a source of potential hemicellulose depolymerization enzymes, resulting in identification of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens isolates with the ability to use xylan (hemicellulose) as the sole carbon source (Sewell et al., 1988). Subsequently, E. coli and K. oxytoca engineered to produce ethanol were further modified to express the C. thermocellum xylanase enzyme (Burchhardt & Ingram, 1992). Ethanologenic E. coli was eventually modified to express the xylodextrin enzymes from K. oxytoca (Qian et al., 2003).
The Ingram group extensively used evolutionary methods for organism improvement. A hallmark of this work is the direct linkage of growth of the organism and production of the desired molecule. For example, the central metabolism of E. coli was modified such that the only way for the cells to maintain redox balance was through the ethanol production pathway (Ohta et al., 1991; Yomano et al., 2008). In this manner, cells with mutations that supported ethanol production were able to grow faster than other cells. Similar strategies were used for production of lactic acid (Grabar et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2003), alanine (Zhang et al., 2007) and succinate (Jantama et al., 2008a; Jantama et al., 2008b; Zhang et al., 2009a; Zhang et al., 2009b). E. coli strain KO11, evolved for ethanol production, was subjected to genome analysis by optical (whole-genome) mapping, resulting in identification of extensive genetic duplication of the ethanol production cassette, as well as large-scale rearrangements of the chromosome (Turner et al., 2012). This type of structural chromosomal analysis remains relatively unusual in analysis of bacterial genomes (Yuan et al., 2020), as opposed to nextgeneration sequencing (Cao et al., 2020).
Lignin is a heteropolymer consisting of aromatic monomers (Davis et al., 2016). Direct biological utilization of lignin is unusual; processes that involve some sort of pretreatment are described below. While the polysaccharide pectin is often overlooked as a biomass component, it makes up a substantial fraction of some agricultural residues, such as beet pulp (Martins et al., 2020). The Ingram group observed that an ethanologenic E. coli strain was able to robustly utilize the pectin component galacturonic acid (Grohmann et al., 1994). One of the Ingram groups' ethanologenic E. coli strains was modified for pectinolytic activity by the expression of select genes from E. chrysanthemi (Edwards et al., 2011).
Plastic
The analogous nature of enzymatic degradation of biomass and plastic has been previously noted (Chen et al., 2020). One can envision that development of industrial organisms for plastic degradation or valorization will follow the same basic path as that used for biomass utilization, particularly cellulose. Specifically, biological depolymerization of plastic will either be performed by an engineered organism or by exogenous provisioning of enzymes that were either purchased or produced in a distinct process step. There are many recent reviews describing microbial activity on plastics (Danso et al., 2019; Devi et al., 2016; Gautam et al., 2007;

Knowledge has also been summarized for specific plastic types, such as PET (Hiraga et al., 2019; Taniguchi et al., 2019) and PE (Ghatge et al., 2020; Mohanan et al., 2020; Pathak & Navneet, 2017; Restrepo-Florez et al., 2014; Sen & Raut, 2015; Shah et al., 2008), and specific organism groups, such as Pseudomonas (Wilkes & Aristilde, 2017).
Ingram's work relied heavily on enzymes encoded by organisms that were bio-prospected from environments rich in the relevant substrate. For example, K. oxytoca was isolated from pulp and paper mill waste streams and Erwinia is known to be capable of depolymerizing biomass to the point of causing `soft rot' (Toth et al., 2003). A similar bioprospecting approach has been used to identify microbes encoding enzymes that enable plastic depolymerization and possibly even chassis organisms, with representative findings shown in Table 1. Many of the organisms described to date have been isolated from plastic-dumping sites and landfills, marine water, with utilization of HDPE and/or LDPE being the most frequently described. The gut of wax-eating worms, such as Galleria melonella, is also a promising environmental niche from which the PE-hydrolyzing bacteria Enterobacter asburiae YT1 and Bacillus sp. YP1 were isolated (Bombelli et al., 2017; Cassone et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2014). Bioprospecting has also included the enrichment of naturally occurring microbial consortia capable of plastic degradation, such as marine bacteria with activity on PE (Syranidou et al., 2019) and soil bacteria with activity on LDPE (Esmaeili et al., 2013).
Microbial activity on plastic is affected by polymer type, the condition of the polymer, the identity of the microbial strain and environmental conditions (Artham & Doble, 2008). Such microbial action typically involves enzymes that are secreted onto the polymer surface and/or the production of substrate-specific biosurfactants. As with cellulose, the crystalline nature of plastic waste is a challenge and reductions in the polymer chain length promote further depolymerization (Ghatge et al., 2020). This initial fragmentation of the polymer often occurs due to abiotic environmental factors like UV radiation or mechanical breakdown (Singh & Sharma, 2008), and process designs that include these elements are described below. As with cellulose depolymerization, there is typically a series of enzymatic reactions to reduce the polymer fragments into smaller units, such as dimers and monomers that can then be assimilated into microbial metabolism.

Our understanding of the depolymerization enzymes that are active on the various types of plastic has greatly expanded in the past decade (Chen et al., 2020; Wei & Zimmermann, 2017). Reviews are available describing PET hydrolases (Carr et al., 2020; Maurya et al., 2020) and include achievements in enzyme engineering (Austin et al., 2018). Many of the polymerdegrading enzymes characterized thus far are similar to enzymes known for their ability to depolymerize biologically produced substances (Danso et al., 2019). This raises the possibility that existing design principles and knowledge can be applied to plasticdepolymerizing enzymes.
As with the Ingram group's expression of cellulase enzymes in chassis organisms, the PETase identified from the PET-utilizing organism Ideonella sakaiensis was expressed in the photosynthetic algae Phaeodactylum tricornutum (Moog et al., 2019). Selection of P. tricornutum as the chassis organism was motivated by the intention of its eventual utilization in a marine-type environment. The prospect of using microbial processes not just to degrade plastics but to reassemble the carbon into a valuable molecule was supported by observation of production of the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolymer from LDPE by several bacterial species (Montazer et al., 2019).
Hybrid Processing of Biomass and Plastic Biomass
Economically viable production of low-value fuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass typically uses a hybrid approach involving not just biological activity, but also abiotic mechanical and chemical steps for size reduction and depolymerization (Baruah et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2020; Zoghlami & Paes, 2019). This combination of biological and abiotic steps is referred to here as "hybrid processing."
Methods for pretreatment and depolymerization of lignocellulosic biomass have been reviewed elsewhere (Bhutto et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2009), including a summary of 20 distinct pretreatment methods across 18 process metrics (Dale & Ong, 2012). The Ingram group frequently used dilute acids for hydrolysis of hemicellulose, though the acid identity changed over time. Their early reports with corn cobs and hulls (Beall et al., 1992), pine wood (Barbosa et al., 1992) and rice hulls (Moniruzzaman et al., 1997) used sulfuric acid. However, other groups demonstrated the advantages of using phosphoric acid instead of sulfuric acid, such as less stringent energy demands and possible means of nutri-

Jarboe et al. | 5

ent economy (de Vasconcelos et al., 2013). The Ingram group described the use of dilute phosphoric acid treatment for biorefining of Eucalyptus benthamii and with sugarcane bagasse (Castro et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 2014). In these processes, dilute acid treatment was combined with other abiotic and biological depolymerization steps, such as steam treatment (Castro et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 2014) and the addition of cellulase enzymes (Geddes et al., 2010b).
Processes have been developed that aim to depolymerize of the lignin component for microbial utilization, such as alkaline treatment and pyrolysis (Davis et al., 2019; Davis et al., 2016; Linger et al., 2014; Ragauskas et al., 2014). The heterogenous nature of lignin, and the resulting heterogeneity of any depolymerization products, presents a challenge relative to sugar utilization through central metabolism. The attempt to shunt as much carbon as possible into central metabolic intermediates has been described "biological funneling" (Linger et al., 2014).
Plastics
Abiotic environmental factors, such as weathering and UV radiation, assist in natural biodegradation of plastics (Wilkes & Aristilde, 2017). UV radiation provides energy and promotes free radical formation on the plastic surface, which in turn generates small molecules that can be utilized by microbes (Devi et al., 2016). Similar to the role of acids in hemicellulose hydrolysis, acids can also initiate the oxidation of polymer surfaces (Arkatkar et al., 2010; Kumar Sen & Raut, 2015; Rajandas et al., 2012). It is expected that the design of plastic waste degradation/valorization processes will include some of these components. For example, HDPE was incubated at 70°C for 10 days prior to characterization with microbial substrates, with the goal of enhancing biodegradation (Awasthi et al., 2017).
Pyrolysis has previously been demonstrated as a rapid and robust means of biomass depolymerization. The feasibility of using pyrolysis for plastic depolymerization in combination with microbial valorization was demonstrated with PP (Mihreteab et al., 2019). Specifically, pyrolysis was used to convert PP pellets to an oil rich in fatty alcohols and alkenes. This oil was then utilized by the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica for the production of lipids. Thermal oxo-degradation of HDPE at moderate temperatures in an oxidative environment was shown to produce a material that supported increased growth of Candida maltosa relative to pyrolyzed HDPE (Brown et al., 2022). The fatty alcohols and hydrocarbons produced by pyrolysis or oxo-degradation of plastics will present various challenges relative to the sugars released from lignocellulosic biomass. Such molecules have lower water solubilities and the associated transporters and metabolic pathways are poorly characterized relative to glycolysis (Beier et al., 2014; Hussain et al., 2017; Iwama et al., 2014).
Overcoming Toxicity Biomass
While there are a variety of effective biomass depolymerization processes, these often result in the release or production of molecules that are inhibitory to the fermentation organism and thus limit the amount of substrate that can be provided, in turn limiting the final product titer (Dale & Ong, 2012; Geddes et al., 2011b). The most well-characterized of these molecules in biomass acid hydrolysate are the small organic acid acetate, released from the biomass, and the aldehyde furfural, a dehydration production of hemicellulose. Other types of biomass treatment methods, such as depolymerization with ionic liquids, also face the issue of organism inhibition (Dickinson et al., 2016). Lignin is often depolymerized into aromatic acids, and these intended

substrates are often inhibitory to the production organism (Davis et al., 2019; Davis et al., 2016).
One route for mitigating this toxicity is the addition of a process step to remove or convert the problematic compound(s). The Ingram group demonstrated the effectiveness of the addition of calcium hydroxide "overliming" and removal of the resulting precipitant in improving microbial utilization of acid-hydrolyzed biomass (Martinez et al., 2001; Martinez et al., 2000). This approach has also been shown to be helpful for other types of biomass depolymerization, such as fast pyrolysis (Chi et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2013). The Ingram group also performed a systematic characterization of various detoxification techniques performed individually and in combination (Geddes et al., 2015). It was shown that for sugarcane bagasse phosphoric acid hydrolysate, a combination of vacuum evaporation to remove volatile inhibitors, laccase enzymes, adjustment to high pH with ammonium hydroxide, addition of bisulfite, and finally microaeration was extremely effective, with ethanol production titers lagging only slightly relative to a representative mix of pure sugars (Geddes et al., 2015).
Another route for mitigating this toxicity is to alter the organism so that its sensitivity to the problematic molecules is reduced. This can be done through both evolution-based strain improvement (Jin et al., 2016) and by rational strain engineering (Jarboe et al., 2011). The Ingram group extensively used evolutionary-based strain improvement for tolerance of various products, model inhibitors, industrial operating conditions, and actual biomass hydrolysate (Geddes et al., 2011b; Jarboe et al., 2007; Shanmugam & Ingram, 2021).
Reverse engineering of evolved strains can be used to propose rational strain engineering designs. This was demonstrated by the Ingram group in regards to furfural tolerance (Miller et al., 2009; Turner et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013) and hydrolysate (Geddes et al., 2011b; Shi et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2016).
Plastics
Given the early stage of characterization of direct microbial utilization of plastics, it is not yet clear if any of the products of biological plastic depolymerization are inhibitory to the associated microbes. One study concluded that there was no negative effect of breakdown products of various plastics on Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Pseudomonas isolates (Taghavi et al., 2021). However, it has been noted that microplastics can increase the tension of lipid membranes (Fleury & Baulin, 2021), and this raises the possibility that membrane engineering strategies may be needed for plastic-utilizing cell factories.
Process Engineering and Scale-Up Biomass
Bioproduction at rates, yields and titers sufficiently high for economic viability often requires process engineering beyond organism development and substrate depolymerization. For example, the fluid properties associated with operating with a high concentration of depolymerized biomass in the production vessel (high solids) makes it challenging to achieve sufficient mixing (Modenbach & Nokes, 2013). Insufficient mixing can lead to fluctuations in pH, which can negatively impact organism performance (Moniruzzaman et al., 1998). The Ingram group demonstrated that ultrasound could be used to improve microbial utilization of mixed waste office paper (Wood, Aldrich, et al., 1997). The low aqueous solubility of depolymerized lignin can be partially mitigated by preparing emulsions (Davis et al., 2019).
While the depolymerized biomass serves as a source of carbon for the production organism, other macronutrients are needed for

metabolic activity, such as nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), phosphorous (P) and trace metals. The Ingram group observed that crude yeast autolysate could serve as a nutrient supplement (York & Ingram, 1996).
For the production of ethanol from sugarcane bagasse, the Ingram group developed seed train procedures (Geddes et al., 2013), adjusted cellulase usage to improve liquid handling of bagasse slurry (Geddes et al., 2010a), simplified the hydrolysis process (Geddes et al., 2011a) and the saccharification process (Geddes et al., 2010b), identified additional additives to address furfural toxicity (Nieves et al., 2011a) and tuned aeration conditions (Nieves et al., 2011b). This process was operated at the pilot scale (80 L) (Nieves et al., 2011b) and resulting data was used in a technoeconomic analysis of operation at commercial scale (83 × 106 L/yr) in Aspen Plus (Gubicza et al., 2016) and SuperPro Designer (van Rijn et al., 2018). These economic analyses emphasized the need to achieve a high product yield, decrease the cost of cellulolytic enzymes, and add value to lignin.
Plastics
Hopefully, process engineering for microbial utilization of plastics can leverage the expertise that has been developed from lignocellulosic processes. It has been reported that utilization of thermally depolymerized PP by Y. lipolytica was increased by the inclusion of biosurfactants (Mihreteab et al., 2019). Many descriptions of microbial utilization of plastic have mentioned biofilms, and these structures were observed to improve LDPE utilization by Pseudomonas ASK2 (Tribedi & Dey, 2017). As with biomass utilization, provisioning of nutrients other than carbon will need to be given careful consideration. Characterization of the microbial communities associated with the North Pacific Gyre revealed evidence of nitrogen limitation (Bryant et al., 2016). This observation serves as a reminder that microbes need to be provided with sufficient nutritional support in order to perform the challenging task of plastic utilization and degradation.
Discussion
Here we have attempted to highlight the similarities between the development of processes for the microbial valorization of lignocellulosic biomass and possible processes for the microbial valorization of plastic waste. This review has focused on the work of Lonnie O'Neal (Neal) Ingram and his colleagues at the University of Florida, but the field of lignocellulosic biomass utilization includes many excellent researchers who have made unique and valuable contributions not described here.
This document has mainly described Ingram's work with the production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass, but his research group worked with many other biochemical products not described here. Finally, this review has not described Ingram's dedication to commercialization and technology transfer. Neal is often quoted as saying "The development of technology for the cost-effective conversion of modern, renewable biomass into a clean-burning automotive fuel has the potential to free the United States and other nations from oil-dependence and to allow a redistribution of wealth based on productivity and ingenuity rather than natural resources." The assertion of this work is that the development of technology for the cost-effective degradation and valorization of plastic waste has the potential to free the global community from the scourge of plastic waste and that the productivity and ingenuity of our scientists and engineers are sufficient to accomplish this goal for the benefit of all.

INTRODUCTION: This case report is the first in the Australian literature of a patient, without prior diagnosis, presenting with a bowel obstruction secondary to lobular breast cancer. This highlights a relatively rare cause of bowel obstruction, but also the importance of breast self-examination as a compliment to the current BreastScreen Australia program. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 67-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department with a 48-h history of sharp, constant epigastric pain, vomiting and constipation. The patient proceeded to emergency laparotomy for presumed large bowel obstruction, which revealed a stricture in the distal terminal ileum causing a distal small bowel obstruction. A right hemicolectomy was performed. Histopathology revealed the terminal ileum stricture to be metastatic lobular breast carcinoma. Clinical examination of the patient's right breast revealed a lesion suggestive of the primary malignancy despite a normal ultrasound and mammogram in 2014. After failing to progress, a CT scan was performed which revealed progressive small and large bowel distension. A repeat laparotomy was performed revealing dilated large bowel without obstructing pathology and an intact anastomosis. A loop ileostomy was performed. Following a further febrile episode, the patient decided to withdraw care and the patient passed away three weeks into her admission from suspected intra-abdominal sepsis. DISCUSSION: Breast cancer is becoming the third most common cancer amongst Australian women with a significant burden of disease and mortality. CONCLUSION: Despite the rare presentation, this case reminds the medical community and general population of the importance of breast self-examination and the BreastScreen Australia program.

A 67-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department with a 48-h history of sharp, constant epigastric pain, vomiting and constipation. Her bowels had opened earlier that same day and reported passing flatus since. She denied bleeding per rectum or other symptoms. Her past surgical history included an open right femoral hernia repair, vaginal converted to transabdominal hysterectomy and a coronary artery bypass graft. Her past medical history included ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and depression. She denied any previous colonoscopies or significant family history. On examination, she appeared comfortable and her observations were within normal limits. Her abdomen was distended and generally tender without peritonism. The remainder of her examination was unremarkable, with no palpable herniae. Laboratory investigations revealed a leucocytosis (12 × 109/L) with otherwise normal biochemistry, including lipase and lactate. Urinalysis was unremarkable. Abdominal x-rays revealed dilated loops of small

Fig. 3. On the high power (100× magnification) haematoxylin and eosin stained histopathological specimen from the right hemicolon, the single filing of polygonal cells into linear cords and the presence of intracytoplasmic and perinuclear vacuoles can be seen (see arrow). These are features typical for lobular carcinoma of breast origin.

Fig. 1. Dilated loops of small bowel without colonic distension are seen on this abdominal x-ray. There is no subdiaphragmatic free gas present.

bowel without colonic distension and no free subdiaphragmatic gas (Fig. 1). Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed features of both small and large bowel obstruction with moderate ascites (Fig. 2). A transition point was seen in the proximal transverse colon without an obvious lesion.
The patient proceeded to emergency laparotomy for presumed large bowel obstruction. This revealed gross ascites and a miliary appearance to the serosa throughout the visible bowel. A stricture was found in the distal terminal ileum causing a distal small bowel obstruction. No lesion was identified on palpation of the entire colon. The decision to perform a right hemicolectomy

was made with a functional end-to-end stapled anastomosis reinforced with 3-0 PDS. No evidence of liver or peritoneal disease was found. Histopathology revealed the terminal ileum stricture to be metastatic carcinoma with morphology and immunoprofile in keeping with metastatic lobular breast carcinoma (oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive; Her2 negative) (Fig. 3). Five of five mesenteric lymph nodes were involved with metastatic disease. Further clinical examination revealed a 1 cm firm, palpable mass in the right breast at 8 o'clock, 1 cm from the nipple suggestive of the primary malignancy. This was despite the patient having had a normal ultrasound and mammogram in 2014. CT brain and bone scan were unremarkable. Repeat breast ultrasound and mammogram with core biopsy to confirm the primary lesion was scheduled for after the patient had recovered. Medical oncology opinion was sought and hormonal therapy was suggested if the patient's current condition improved.
After failing to progress by post-operative day 8, with ongoing tenderness, distension and rising C-reactive protein (CRP), a CT scan was performed which revealed progressive small and large bowel distension with the transition point seen at the splenic flexure. A repeat laparotomy was performed by a covering surgeon at the time. This revealed dilated large bowel up to the splenic flexure without obstructing pathology. The anastomosis was interrogated and found to be intact. The decision was made to perform a loop ileostomy. The stoma was functional three days following her second laparotomy. However, following an episode where the patient became febrile, tachypnoeic and tachycardic with a rising CRP, the patient decided to withdraw care. Arrangements for palliation were made and the patient passed away three weeks into her admission from suspected intra-abdominal sepsis.
3. Discussion
This case is the first in the Australian literature of a patient, without prior diagnosis, presenting with a bowel obstruction secondary to lobular breast cancer. This highlights a relatively rare cause of bowel obstruction, but also the importance of breast selfexamination as a compliment to the current BreastScreen Australia program [2].
In 2016, breast cancer is estimated to become the third most commonly diagnosed cancer, with 16,084 new cases of breast cancer expected to be diagnosed in Australia alone [3]. Lobular breast

cancer represents approximately ten per cent of all breast cancer, but more frequently metastasises to bowel than other breast cancer sub-types. Current five-year survival rates for lobular breast cancer are around eighty-five percent [4].
The most common sites for gastrointestinal metastases from lobular breast cancer are reported to be colon and rectum (45%) and stomach (28%) [5]. Chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are the mainstay for treatment of patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease. Despite this, median survival remains around two and half years [6].

abstract
Aim and Background: Dipyridamole-induced stress myocardial perfusion scans (MPS) has been widely used for management of coronary artery disease. The adverse effects of dipyridamole and other stress agents have been evaluated. The aim of this research is to confirm the dynamic data on dipyridamole side effects during MPS. Methods: We collected data of 183 patients who underwent dipyridamole-induced stress MPS by retrospectively reviewing their clinical records, which included the severity of dipyridamole side effects in 3 min, 10 min, and 20 min after infusion. The incidence and severity at all three points, including the effect of age and gender, were obtained. Results: Adverse effects occurred in 96 patients (69.6%). The most frequent symptoms were dizziness (42.8%), chest tightness (24.6%), abdominal pain (18.1%), and headache (15.2%). Most symptoms were Grade 1 to 2, according to the grading system for common terminology criteria. The median duration of symptom persistence was 36 min, not significantly different among age and gender. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the adverse effects of dipyridamole were generally minimal and its duration was acceptable for clinical usage. © 2016 The Author(s).

1. Introduction
Cardiovascular disease has been the second most common mortality since 2000 in Taiwan [1]. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a useful tool in diagnosing and follow up care for coronary artery disease [2]. According to current clinical guidelines for better sensitivity and specificity, the exam is performed with a stress test [2-4]. Dipyrdamole, a vasodilator, is one of the most widely used agents in stress tests in Taiwan. According to prior literature, up to 70% of patients undergoing dipyridamole stress suffer from adverse effects such as flush, chest pain, headache, dizziness, hypotension, abdominal pain, or diarrhea [5-9]. However, severity and duration of adverse effects have not been analyzed. As stated, the aim of this study is to examine dynamic data of dipyridamole side effects during MPS.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Patients and data collection
In our institute, symptoms of patients receiving dipyridamole-stress MPI for 3 min, 10 min, and 20 min were recorded, according to the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Effects v4.0 (CTCAE) [10]. Records were written and maintained by physicians and technicians. Symptoms recorded included: chest tightness, palpitation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, headache, dizziness, neck pain, dyspnea, weakness, and flush. If symptoms persisted for more than 20 min after administration, we recorded timing of recovery. In the case of aminophylline use to relieve adverse effects, we also recorded administration timing.
From July 2nd 2013 to July 19th 2013, there were 183 patients receiving MPI. There were 138 complete records of symptoms after delivery of dipyridamole. For an evaluation of confounding factors, we collected the following parameters: age, gender, and frequency of regular exercise. These comorbidities were recorded in the clinical chart review: hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, prior myocardial infarction (MI), documented coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive

heart failure. The laboratory data over 3 months were also recorded: creatinine level, lipid profile, and hepatic enzyme glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT).
These methods were approved by our institutional review board.
2.2. Stress protocol
All patients underwent the Thallium-201 (Tl-201) stress and earlyredistribution MPI with the dipyridamole stress test, on the recommendation of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI and EANM). Heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG monitoring were performed throughout the stress test.

R project version 3.1.2 was used for statistical analysis. The continuous parameters were expressed in terms of mean and standard deviation (SD). The categorical variables were expressed as count and percentage. Severity of each symptom at 3 min, 10 min, and 20 min were also expressed as count and percentage.
The Kaplan-Meier curve was used to highlight persistent symptoms. Patients were in two groups according to age (age N65). For an evaluation of confounding factors, e.g., gender and age, the Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression test were used for comparison between males and females, the age groups, and the exercise groups.
3. Results
Data from 138 patients were analyzed and listed in Table 1. The average age was 66.1 ± 13.4 years (range 32-90). Seventy-five were male (54.3%) and 60 study subjects exercised more than 3 times per week (43.5%). There were 96 patients (69.6%) suffering from symptoms of drug side effects during observation. Between the symptomatic and asymptomatic group, the incidence of comorbidities and lab data were not statistically different, except that the serum creatinine level was

higher in the asymtomatic group. However, in the symptomatic group, the ratio of female patients was significantly higher than in the asymptomatic group (p = 0.002141), while the age was significantly younger (p = 0.009262).
The frequency and severity of adverse effects are listed in Table 2 and Fig. 1. Adverse effects occurred in 96 patients (69.6%), with the most frequent symptoms being dizziness (42.8%), chest tightness (24.6%), abdominal pain (18.1%), and headache (15.2%). These effects accompany dyspnea (8.7%), nausea (8.0%), neck pain (7.2%), weakness (5.1%), palpitation (3.6%), and flush (2.9%). No patients had diarrhea in our study population, while most symptoms were Grade 1 and 2. Seven patients had Grade 3 symptoms as shown in Table 6. There were 18 patients receiving aminophylline treatment due to adverse effects. For patients with symptoms at 3 min, the persistent symptoms can be seen in the Kaplan-Meier curve (Fig. 2). The median duration of persistent symptoms was 36 min (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30-46 min). Fifty-six patients (40.6%) did not recover from side effects at 20 min, while 32 of them were female.

Fig. 1. Severity of adverse effects after dipyridamole infusion at 3 different points. Grading is based on CTCAE v4.0.

There was a significantly higher incidence of adverse effects in the female population than the male population at all points (Tables 1 and 3). There is a higher incidence in women for the three time points of dizziness, chest tightness, abdominal pain, headache, dyspnea, nausea, weakness, and palpitation. However, there is a significant difference between genders for dizziness only at 10 min.
There is no significant difference of symptom duration between genders (Fig. 3), as the p value of the Cox regression is 0.421. The median time for symptom-relief took 33 min for women and 36 min for men. Women tend to have a higher incidence of adverse effects, and more severe symptoms. There is a significant difference in dizziness between the two groups at 10 min (p = 0.003724).
Younger patients (age b 65) tended to have a higher probability of adverse effects than older patients, which was the only statistically significant difference at 3 min (Table 4). The younger group had a greater risk for all symptoms except dizziness. Symptom duration was similar

between age groups (Fig. 4), and p = 0.374. The median time of symptom-relief took 33 min in older people and 48 min in younger people. Younger people also had a higher incidence of adverse effects and more severe symptoms. There was not a significant difference for chest tightness and nausea between the two groups at 3 min (p = 0.000162). Exercise did not interfere with adverse dipyridamole effects in our study. (See Table 5.)
4. Discussion
The purpose of the MPI stress test is to induce a distinction in blood flow between normal coronary arteries and those with stenosis. Dipyridamole has been used as a pharmaceutical method of stress testing. Dipyridamole infusion blocks reabsorption and metabolism of endogenic adenosine [11,12], elevates extra-cellular adenosine concentration [12,13], non-selectively activates all types of adenosine receptors [12], induces vascular resistance of normal coronary artery decrease, and creates myocardial blood flow increase up to 5-fold [11-13]. On the other hand, the blood flow of the myocardium, which is supplied by stenosed coronary arteries, was unable to increase blood flow from the stress due to compensatory dilation at rest [11, 12]. Dipyridamole-stress MPI is able to detect coronary artery disease as accurately as exercise stress tests, and provides prognostic information regarding cardiac death and myocardial infarction [11].
Using dipyridamole in myocardial perfusion is generally safe [5-8, 13,14]. Nevertheless, up to 70% of patients undergoing dipyridamole stress suffer from variable adverse effects, such as flush, chest pain, headache, dizziness, hypotension, abdominal pain, or diarrhea [5-9]. Adverse effects can develop from stimulating different types of adenosine receptors and signal pathways, including peripheral vasodilation and hypotension [12].
In our study population, 69.6% of patients suffered from the adverse effects of dipyridamole. The most frequent symptoms were dizziness, chest tightness, abdominal pain, and headache. Prior literature shows the incidence of adverse effects from dipyridamole can range from 27.9% to 75.36% [5-7,9,15-17]. However, there is a wide variation of the definition of adverse effects among studies.

The half-life of dipyridamole is approximately 30-45 min [12]. In our study, the median duration of persistent symptoms was 36 min. Duration of symptoms was not significantly different between gender and age group.
In our study population, the most frequent symptom was dizziness, which made up 42.8% of patients. Most of the symptoms were Grade 1, although nobody suffered from severe dizziness (Grade 3). A study by Takeishi et al. revealed similar results, i.e., that the incidence of dizziness from dypiridamole-stress MPI was 51% [17]. In contrast, Colarinha et al. showed that 13 individuals out of 140 patients (9.3%) undergoing

dypiridamole-stress MPI experienced dizziness [16]. The variation may have resulted from different awareness levels of it.
The second most frequent symptom was chest tightness, with an accumulated incidence of 24.6%. It is much higher than found in prior studies, ranging from 0.68% to 16.4% [5,6,13,15,16], but lower than the results of Takeishi et al [17]. Most of our patients suffered from mild chest tightness, although only 12 patients (8.7%) had chest tightness greater or equal to Grade 2, and only four people (2.9%) had Grade 3 chest tightness. Dipyridamole-induced chest tightness has been correlated with more severe coronary artery disease [17].
According to our data, females have a greater potential to experience adverse effects (Table 3 and Fig. 2). This phenomenon is revealed in a prior study [6,8,18]. Our data revealed that women have a higher accumulated risk for all symptoms. However, there is a statistically significant difference in dizziness at 10 min, similar to the results of Kong et al. [18]. Prior reports show that adenosine-induced adverse effects are higher in women [19-21]. The gender difference is not yet clear, but could possibly be related to different fat-to-muscle ratio [18].
In our study population, younger subjects have greater potential to have adverse effects, except for dizziness (Table 4). A report from Lette et al. revealed that the frequency of dipyridamole-induced side effects is less in patients older than 70 [8]. Adenosine-related side effects also occur more frequently in younger people [22]. Our data shows, compared to those older than 65, that younger people have higher risk of all symptoms, except dizziness. There is a significant difference of chest tightness and nausea between the two age groups, but only at 3 min.
The limitation of our study includes a retrospective study design with some missing data (24.6%), and a relatively small population. Due to these issues, we did not record symptom onset more than 20 min after the dipyridamole injection, and as such, any delayed adverse effects were not evaluated.

5. Conclusion
Our study reveals that dipyridamole use in MPS is generally safe. Women and younger people tended to have a higher risk of adverse effects. However, there is a trend that the elderly have a higher risk of dizziness than younger people. Duration of adverse effects was not significantly different for gender and age.

abstract
Purpose: To use pathologic indicators to determine which patients benefit from postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) for breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and total mastectomy (TM). Patients and methods: We enrolled 4236 patients with breast invasive ductal carcinoma who received NACT followed by TM. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals; independent predictors were controlled for or stratified in the analysis. Results: After multivariate Cox regression analyses, the adjusted HRs derived for PMRT for all-cause mortality were 0.65 (0.52e0.81, P < 0.0001) and 0.58 (0.47e0.71, P < 0.0001) in postchemotherapy pathologic tumor stages T2e4 (ypT3e4) and postchemotherapy pathologic nodal stages N2e3 (ypN2e3), respectively. Moreover, adjusted HRs derived for PMRT with all-cause mortality were 0.51 (0.38e0.69, P < 0.0001), 0.60 (0.40e0.88, P ¼ 0.0096), and 0.64 (0.48e0.86, P ¼ 0.0024) in pathological stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, respectively. Additionally, the PMRT group showed significant locoregional control irrespective of the pathologic response, even ypT0, ypN0, or pathological complete response (pCR), compared with the No-PMRT group. The multivariate analysis showed no statistical differences between the PMRT and No-PMRT groups for distant metastasis-free survival in any pathologic response of ypT0 e4, ypN0e3, and pathologic American Joint Committee on Cancer stages pCR to IIIC. Conclusion: For patients with breast cancer ypT3e4, ypN2e3, or pathologic stages IIIAeIIIC receiving NACT and TM, benefit from PMRT if it is associated with OS benefits, regardless of the clinical stage of the disease. Compared with No-PMRT, PMRT improved locoregional recurrence-free survival, even pCR, in patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction
Most patients with locally advanced breast cancer, and some with early-stage disease, particularly with triple negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive status, are treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) [1,2]. The goal of the treatment is to induce a tumor response before surgery and enable breast conservation [1,2]. Moreover, NACT provides information regarding response to therapy that may be useful in the future if the disease recurs. NACT results in long-term distant disease-free survival and overall survival (OS) comparable with those achieved with primary surgery followed by adjuvant systemic therapy [3,4]. However, the choice between breast conservation and total mastectomy (TM) after NACT is dependent on the pathologic response and patients' breast size in relation to residual tumor size [5,6]. Therefore, the surgical approach to the primary tumor depends on the size of the tumor and breast [5,6]. Asian women have relatively smaller breasts compared with women in Western countries [7]. Thus, TM rates among women receiving NACT in Asia have been high [8]. Therefore, the number of Taiwanese patients with breast cancer receiving NACT followed by TM is high [9]. The effect of postchemotherapy pathologic tumor stages (ypT), postchemotherapy pathologic nodal stages (ypN), or overall pathologic American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stages would be valuable for further adjuvant treatment in Taiwan or Asia because most patients in Taiwan still receive TM after NACT [8,9].
Postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) has two potential benefits, namely a decrease in the rate of locoregional recurrence (LRR) and increases in long-term breast cancer-specific survival and OS for certain patient populations (one or more of the following: involvement of axillary lymph nodes, a tumor size of more than 5 cm, and invasion of the cancer to skin or pectoral fascia) [10e13]. These benefits have been consistently reported in multiple studies [10e13]. Decisions on who should receive PMRT depend on the baseline risk for recurrence, such as women who have >3 involved lymph nodes, 1e3 involved lymph nodes, or high-risk primary tumors [10e13]. However, the indications of PMRT for patients who received neoadjuvant therapy have been controversial, especially in patients receiving TM [14,15]. LRR benefits have been presented in patients with any degree of residual macroscopic nodal disease after NACT with PMRT because retrospective evidence suggests that recurrence is high in such patients [16]. PMRT has been offered to patients with residual breast disease (ypT1e4), although the threshold to omit PMRT in such patients is lower than that for patients with residual nodal (ypN1e3) disease [16,17]. Evidence with ypT or ypN as indicators is insufficient for determining further PMRT, and a combination of ypT and ypN as indicators has not been considered for determining further PMRT.
Until now, no detailed outcome analysis is available regarding PMRT for breast cancer after NACT and TM depending on different pathologic responses and stratification based on ypT, ypN, and overall pathologic AJCC stages. In our study, we estimated the detailed outcomes of OS, LRR, and distant metastasis (DM) in PMRT for breast cancer status after NACT and TM with various pathologic responses of ypT, ypN, or overall pathologic AJCC stages. Moreover, we prefer using pathologic indicators to determine conditions for PMRT for breast cancer after NACT and TM.
2. Patients and methods
In this study, we established a cohort of breast cancer using data from the Taiwan Cancer Registry database (TCRD). The final cohort eligible for further analysis consisted of 4236 patients (2917 and 1319 patients in PMRT and No-PMRT, respectively). We enrolled patients with breast invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) diagnosis

between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2015. The follow-up duration was from the index date (the date of breast cancer diagnosis) to December 31, 2016. The Cancer Registry database of the Collaboration Center of Health Information Application contains detailed cancer-related information of patients, including the clinical stage, treatment modalities, pathological data, radiation techniques, irradiation doses, hormone receptor status, HER2 status, and chemotherapy regimens used [18e26]. In the study, we included PMRT of both the chest wall and regional nodes with a minimum of 50 Gy. Patients with no evidence of lymph node involvement prior to or during NACT, or those who had negative needle biopsies of any suspicious nodes at diagnosis, should undergo post-NACT sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). If the SLNB post-treatment is positive, surgeons in Taiwan suggest proceeding with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Our protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taipei Medical University. The diagnoses of the enrolled patients were confirmed through their pathological data, and patients who received a new diagnosis of breast IDC were confirmed to have no other cancer. Patients with a diagnosis of breast IDC receiving NACT followed by TM, age 20 years, and AJCC clinical cancer stage IeIV were included. Moreover, the AJCC clinical staging was recorded in the TCRD. The breast cancer stages were based on AJCC, seventh edition. Patients with metastasis, missing sex data, age <20 years, nonstandard PMRT, unclear differentiation of tumor grade, unclear pathologic response, missing estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) status, missing HER2 status, and unclear staging were excluded. Furthermore, we excluded patients with unclear NACT regimen, fewer than four cycles of NACT, ill-defined nodal surgery (neither SLNB nor ALND), and nonrecorded hospital type [27] (academic center or community hospitals) in our cohort. ER or PR positive was defined as  1% of tumor cells demonstrating positive nuclear staining through immunohistochemistry [28], and HER2 positive was defined as immunohistochemistry score 3þ or fluorescence in situ hybridization ratio  2 [27,29]. Finally, we enrolled patients with breast IDC receiving NACT followed by TM and categorized them into the following groups according to the treatment modality to compare their outcomes: group 1 (control group), consisting of patients who did not receive PMRT, and group 2 (case group), consisting of patients who received PMRT. Index date means the date met inclusion criteria and also the start of follow-up. The index date was the date of breast cancer diagnosis. Comorbidities were scored using the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) [30,31]. Only comorbidities observed 6 months before the index date were included; comorbidities were identified and included according to the main International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes for the first admission or more than two repeated main diagnosis codes for visits to the outpatient department.
After adjustment for confounders, the time-dependent Cox proportional method was used to model the time from the index date to all-cause mortality, LRR, and DM among patients who underwent PMRT or No-PMRT. In the multivariate analysis, hazard ratios (HRs) were adjusted for PMRT, age, diagnosis year, CCI scores, tumor differentiation, AJCC clinical stages, ypT, ypN, NACT regimen, nodal surgery, ER/PR, HER2 status, and hospital type. The effects of PMRT on OS, LRR-free survival, and DM-free survival in multivariable Cox regression analysis, in patients who received NACT and TM with or without PMRT, were stratified according to ypT, ypN, or pathologic AJCC stages. Stratified analyses in different pathologic T or N stages were performed to evaluate the OS, LRR, and DM risk associated with PMRT or No-PMRT; furthermore, in the multivariate analysis, we used age, diagnosis year, CCI scores, tumor differentiation, AJCC clinical stages, ypT, ypN, NACT regimen, nodal surgery, ER/PR, HER2 positive, and hospital type. All analyses were

performed using SAS (version 9.3; SAS, Cary, NC, USA). A two-tailed value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
3. Results
The final cohort eligible for further analysis consisted of 4236 patients (2917 and 1319 patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively). The patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. No statistical differences were noted between the PMRT and No-PMRT groups in terms of age, tumor grade, and ER/PR status (Table 1). The number of patients receiving PMRT in 2011e2015 was higher than that in 2007e2010. In the PMRT group, the number of patients with breast cancer with AJCC clinical stages IIIeIV was high. Few patients with pathological complete response (pCR) received PMRT. Moreover, most patients with breast cancer receiving PMRT received NACT and TM irrespective of the pathologic response. Patients receiving PMRT included those with advanced residual T or N stages. Most patients in the PMRT group received ALND as nodal surgery. Most

patients receiving NACT with a taxane-based regimen received PMRT. The PMRT group mostly consisted of HER2-positive patients. Most patients receiving PMRT were treated in nonacademic hospitals (Table 1).
According to the multivariate Cox regression analysis, PMRT was a significantly independent predictor of OS and LRR but a nonsignificant predictor of DM (Tables 2e4). Both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that No-PMRT, CCI 2, poor differentiation, AJCC clinical stages IIIeIV, and pathologic residual tumor (ypT1e4) or nodal (ypN1e3) stages are poor prognostic factors for OS (Table 2). Well-differentiated tumor grade, namely ypT0, ypN0, or ER/PR positive, was an independent good prognostic factor for OS. In addition, according to a multivariate analysis, poor prognostic factors for LRR were No-PMRT, poor differentiation of tumor grade, AJCC clinical stages IIIeIV, residual ypT1e4 or ypN1e3, and ER/PR positive status (Table 3). Table 4 shows that AJCC clinical stage IV, poor differentiation of tumor grade, ypT2e4, ypN1e3, and HER2 positive status were poor

prognostic factors for DM. According to both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, the adjusted HRs (95% confidence interval [CI]) of PMRT and No-PMRT were 0.71 (0.56e0.77), 0.51 (0.41e0.58), and 0.91 (0.77e1.21) for all-cause mortality, LRR, and DM, respectively.
For stratified pathologic T (ypT0e4), pathologic N (ypN0e3), or pathologic AJCC stages, multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that PMRT was a significant independent predictor of improved OS in patients with breast cancer who received NACT and TM with pathologic ypT3e4, ypN2e3, or pathologic AJCC stage IIIAeIIIC (Fig. 1). Adjusted HRs for PMRT for all-cause mortality were 0.65 (0.52e0.81) and 0.58 (0.47e0.71) in ypT3e4 and ypN2e3, respectively (Fig. 1). Moreover, adjusted HRs for PMRT for all-cause mortality were 0.51 (0.38e0.69), 0.60 (0.40e0.88), and 0.64 (0.48e0.86) in pathological AJCC stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, respectively (Fig. 1). Additionally, PMRT showed significant locoregional control irrespective of the pathologic response, even ypT0, ypN0, or pCR, compared with the No-PMRT group (Fig. 2). The adjusted HRs (95% CI) of the PMRT group to No-PMRT group for LRR-free survival were 0.36 (0.18e0.74), 0.39 (0.30e0.52), 0.64 (0.52e0.80), 0.42 (0.33e0.53), 0.60 (0.46e0.80), 0.46 (0.36e0.60), and 0.28 (0.23e0.34) in ypT0, ypT1, ypT2, yoT3e4, ypN0, ypN1, and ypN2e3, respectively (Fig. 2). The adjusted HRs of LRR-free survival derived for PMRT for breast cancer after NACT and TM were 0.28 (0.12e0.64), 0.36 (0.21e0.60), 0.690(0.43e0.84), 0.61 (0.44e0.85), 0.24 (0.18e0.31), 0.40 (0.26e0.62), and 0.34 (0.25e0.46) in patients

with pathologic AJCC stage pCR, stage IA, IBeIIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, respectively (Fig. 2). A multivariate analysis revealed no statistical differences between PMRT and No-PMRT groups for DMfree survival in any pathologic response of ypT0e4, ypN0e3, and pathologic AJCC stages pCR to IIIC (Supplemental Figure 1).
4. Discussion
PMRT has been prevalent in patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM in recent years (Table 1). However, the definitive indications of adjuvant PMRT are controversial in these patients [14,15]; clinical stages did not provide convincing evidence for performing PMRT in patients with breast cancer who have received NACT and TM [32e38]. Because controversy exists regarding clinical stages for indicating PMRT [14,15,32e38], pathologic tumor or nodal stages might be important basic references for further PMRT in patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM. Therefore, we focused on the pathologic stages after NACT as indicators for performing further PMRT in these patients.
According to Table 1, the clinical stage or pathologic stages were more advanced in the PMRT group than those in the No-PMRT group. Patients in the PMRT group had higher CCI scores than did those in the No-PMRT group (Table 1). Advanced clinical stages, pathologic stages, and higher CCI scores were poor prognostic factors for OS or LRR in patients with breast cancer after NACT and TM (Tables 2 and 3). Although there were more patients with

advanced stages or high CCI scores in the PMRT group compared with in the No-PMRT group, OS was superior in the PMRT group compared with the No-PMRT group. The survival benefits of OS in the PMRT group were only underestimated and null to the hypothesis. PMRT leads to improved OS and LRR, and the conclusions could not be overturned.
According to Table 2, the AJCC clinical stage was an independent poor prognostic factor of OS, especially in stages IIIeIV. In addition, clinical stage IIIeIV was a poor prognostic factor for LRR (Table 3), and clinical stage IV was a poor prognostic factor for DM (Table 4). The clinical stage is an important factor indicating the risk of OS, LRR, and DM (Tables 2e4). Our findings were compatible with previous studies [32e38]. Retrospective data of women with clinical stage III receiving PMRT have indicated improved local control even for patients who had a pCR to NACT [32,34,37,38]. In one retrospective study consisting of >670 women treated with NACT followed by TM, PMRT was associated with a significantly low rate of LRR at 10 years (22% versus 11%) and a low risk of death from breast cancer (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.34e0.71) [34]. Among the 46 patients who presented with clinical stage III or IV and achieved a pCR with NACT, PMRT was associated with a reduced 10-year rate of LRR (3% versus 33% among patients not receiving PMRT). By contrast, other retrospective data have suggested that certain patients who achieve a pCR with NACT have low rates of LRR following TM without PMRT [14,15]. The conclusions are conflicting regarding the need for PMRT in patients with breast cancer who received NACT

and TM, especially pCR [14,15]. For example, a large retrospective study of 3000 women treated with mastectomy with or without PMRT revealed that PMRT was associated with a modest reduction in 10-year LRR (10.3% versus 12.6% among patients who did not receive PMRT), with predictors of recurrence being clinical node involvement prior to NACT and tumor size > 5 cm [15]. Patients lacking these features were at low risk of LRR [15]. Taken together, whether PMRT is advantageous for patients with breast cancer after NACT and TM based on clinical stages is still debatable. Thus, pathologic findings might be crucial indicators of PMRT. Our study showed that PMRT improves OS in patients with ypT3e4, ypN2e3, or pathologic stage IIIAeIIIC compared with the No-PMRT group, and clinical stages were adjusted (Fig. 1). Regardless of clinical stages, we recommend that PMRT is necessary for patients with breast cancer who received NACT and TM with ypT3e4, ypTN1e3, or pathologic stages IIIAeIIIC, and PMRT could result in greater OS than could No-PMRT.
Other predictors of OS in these patients with breast cancer who received NACT and TM are also presented in Table 2, with poor differentiation, CCI 2, and ER/PR negative being poor prognostic factors for OS. No study has shown that poor differentiation, CCI 2, and ER/PR negative are poor prognostic factors in breast cancer after NACT and TM, but previous studies have considered high CCI scores [39], ER/PR negative [40], and poor tumor differentiation [41e43] as poor prognostic factors for OS, DM, or LRR in patients with breast cancer who received various treatments.

showed that ER/PR negative, CCI 2, or poor tumor differentiation are poor prognostic factors for OS in patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM (Table 2). In addition, poor differentiation and HER2 positive status are poor prognostic factors for LRR (Table 3), and our outcomes were similar to those of previous studies in different treatments for breast cancer [41,44]. Moreover, poor differentiation and HER2 positive status were high risk factors for DM (Table 4), and our findings were compatible with those of other studies in different treatments for breast cancer [42,45]. Thus, poor differentiation was a poor prognostic factor for OS, LRR, and DM; HER2 positive was a poor prognostic factor for LRR and DM; and CCI 2 and ER/PR positive were poor prognostic factors for OS. Furthermore, our study showed that not only were clinical stages, pathologic stages, ypT, and ypN significant factors for survival but also poor differentiation, CCI 2, and HER2 positive status were poor prognostic factors for survival (Tables 2e4).
According to Tables 2e4, pathologic stages are significant factors for PMRT in patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM. The effects of PMRT on OS, LRR-free survival, and distant metastasisfree survival in multivariable Cox regression analysis for patients who received NACT and TM with or without PMRT were analyzed (Figs. 1 and 2 and Supplemental Figure 1). After the adjustment of all predictors mentioned in Table 2, PMRT was found to be superior for OS in patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM with ypT3e4, ypN1e3, and pathologic AJCC stages IIIAeIIIC compared with the No-PMRT group. Our findings suggest that PMRT might be necessary for patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM

with ypT3e4, ypN2e3, or pathologic stages IIIAeIIIIC. Thus, PMRT is not required for patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM with pCR, early pathologic stages IAeIIB, ypT0e2, or ypN0e1 regardless of clinical stages or other predictors (Fig. 1). Moreover, PMRT is significantly superior for LRR-free survival in patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM with pCR, ypT0e4, or ypN0e3 (Fig. 2). Our findings were compatible with some retrospective studies, indicating that PMRT is beneficial for lowering LRR irrespective of the pathologic response [32e38]. In addition, PMRT is not significant for the reduction of DM risk in patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM (Supplemental Figure 1). Our findings suggest that PMRT associated with improved OS should be a necessary factor for ypT3e4, ypN2e3, or pathologic stage IIIAeIIIC patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM regardless of clinical stages. PMRT could improve LRR-free survival, even pCR, in patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM compared with No-PMRT (Fig. 2).
The strength of our study is that it is the largest cohort study in Taiwan to estimate the detailed outcomes of PMRT for patients with breast cancer, including OS, LRR, and DM, depending on the pathologic response of ypT, ypN, or pathologic stages. The PMRT treatment and NACT regimens were relatively homogenous in our study. Scarce studies have estimated the effects of PMRT for detailed outcomes of OS, LRR, and DM in patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM and adjustment of all predictors including clinical stages. In our study, poor prognostic factors for OS in these patients were no PMRT, advanced clinical stages IIIeIV before NACT,

poor differentiation, ypT1e4, ypN1e3, CCI 2, ER/PR negative, and HER2 positive status (Table 2). Multivariate Cox regression analysis for patients who received NACT and TM with or without PMRT revealed that PMRT led to superior OS in ypT3e4, yN1e3, or stage IIIAeIIIC irrespective of clinical stages and other predictors (Fig. 1). Our study is the first to estimate the OS, LRR, and DM of PMRT for patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM with different ypT, ypN, and overall AJCC pathological stages. The beneficial effects of PMRT were improved OS and LRR-free survival compared with the No-PMRT group based on the multivariate analysis.
This study has some limitations. First, because all patients with breast IDC were Asian, the corresponding ethnic susceptibility compared with non-Asian populations remains unclear; hence, our results should be cautiously extrapolated to non-Asian populations. However, no evidence demonstrates the differences in outcomes of PMRT for patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM between Asian and non-Asian populations. Second, the diagnoses of all comorbid conditions were based on ICD-9-CM codes. Nevertheless, the Taiwan Cancer Registry Administration randomly reviews charts and interviews patients to verify the accuracy of the diagnoses, and hospitals with outlier chargers or practices may be audited and subsequently heavily penalized if malpractice or discrepancies are identified. Third, to prevent the creation of several subgroups, various neoadjuvant treatments were not categorized separately during the analyses. Thus, the effects of different neoadjuvant treatments remain unclear. Fourth, the selection bias in the study were patients in the PMRT group had higher CCI scores than did those in the No-PMRT group. However, there were more patients with advanced stages or high CCI scores in the PMRT group compared with in the No-PMRT group, OS was superior in the PMRT group compared with the No-PMRT group. The survival benefits of OS in the PMRT group were only underestimated and null to the hypothesis. PMRT leads to improved OS and LRR, and the

conclusions could not be overturned. Accordingly, to obtain crucial information on population specificity and disease occurrence, a large-scale randomized trial comparing carefully selected patients undergoing suitable treatments is essential. Finally, the TCRD does not contain information regarding dietary habits, socioeconomic status, or body mass index, all of which may be risk factors for mortality. However, considering the magnitude and statistical significance of the observed effects in this study, these limitations are unlikely to affect the conclusions.
5. Conclusions
In patients with breast cancer type ypT3e4, ypN2e3, or pathologic stage IIIAeIIIC receiving NACT and TM, benefit from PMRT if it is associated with improved OS. Compared with No-PMRT, PMRT improved LRR-free survival, even pCR, in patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM.

Condensed abstract
No large-scale study has estimated detailed outcome patterns of postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) stratified based on postchemotherapy pathologic tumor or nodal stages (ypT and ypN, respectively) for overall survival (OS), locoregional recurrence, or distant metastasis in patients with breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and total mastectomy (TM). We used pathologic indicators to determine which patients benefit from PMRT for breast cancer after NACT and TM. For patients with breast cancer ypT3e4, ypN2e3, or pathologic stages IIIAeIIIC receiving NACT and TM, PMRT should be performed if it is associated with OS benefits, regardless of their clinical stages. Compared with No-PMRT, PMRT improved locoregional recurrence-free survival and even pathological complete response in patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM.

ABSTRACT
Pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma (PMEC) is an extremely rare tumor of the respiratory system. The clinical presentation of PMEC is variable and nonspecific, including cough, hemoptysis, and wheezing, and may mimic other symptoms of pneumonia or asthma. Here, we present a case of PMEC in a 12-year-old male who was diagnosed with and treated for asthma for 2 years. The patient presented with symptoms of respiratory failure that did not respond to steroids or bronchodilator medications. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans revealed an endotracheal tumor. The patient underwent complete tumor resection, with no signs of recurrence 6 months after treatment.

1. Introduction
Primary pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma originates from the glands that line the tracheobronchial tree [1] and represents approxi­ mately 0.1%-0.2% of all primary lung tumors [2]. PMEC often affects younger patients compared with other, more common types of lung cancer [3]. Due to the tumor location, patients typically present with symptoms associated with bronchial obstruction and atelectasis [3]. The tumors can be classified as low-grade or high-grade based on histo­ pathological results [3]. Complete surgical resection remains the pri­ mary therapy for PMEC [4]. This case emphasizes the roles of imaging and histopathology in the diagnosis, exclusion of other diseases, and avoidance of misdiagnosis and mistreatment.
2. Case report
A 12-year-old male patient who was diagnosed with asthma 2 years prior presented with increasing shortness of breath, wheezing, and

cough. The patient had no history of allergies. The patient had previ­ ously been hospitalized several times due to the same symptoms and was treated with bronchodilators and steroids; however, the symptoms did not improve and appeared to increase in severity. A blood test revealed increased neutrophil cell count (13 G/L) and C-reactive protein level (25 mg/L). A chest computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which revealed an intratracheal mass. This mass was well-circumscribed with homogeneous enhancement (Fig. 1). The lung parenchyma was normal, and no mediastinal lymph nodes were observed. Bronchoscopy and tumor resection were indicated. The histological results demonstrated that the tumor cells included epidermoid, mucous, and intermediate cells without keratinization (Fig. 2). The final diagnosis was a low-grade PMEC tumor with negative surgical margins. The patient was not treated with any adjuvant therapy. After surgery, the symptoms of breathless­ ness and wheezing disappeared. Chest CT scans 6 months after surgery showed no signs of recurrence (Fig. 1).

3. Discussion
Lung cancer is quite rare in children. Smoking and asbestos exposure do not appear to be risk factors for PMEC [5]. PMEC affects male and female individuals equally and is primarily located in the trachea and bronchus [1]. Only 5% of PMEC cases are classified as high-grade, with the majority (95%) classified as low-grade [6]. Low-grade tumors often occur in young patients, whereas high-grade tumors are more likely to be observed in older patients [7].
The chest radiography may show consolidation, atelectasis, or a solitary lung nodule or mass; however, the chest X-ray may also appear normal in the case of a small endobronchial tumor without airway obstruction [8]. Chest CT scans typically show an endobronchial mass, with or without bronchial dilatation, and air trapping, obstructive pneumonia, or atelectasis [2,4]. Wang et al. [9] reported that low-grade PMEC is often located in the central bronchial or trachea, with smooth and well-defined margins, oval or lobular in shape, and markedly ho­ mogeneously enhancing; high-grade PMEC tends to be peripheral, with ill-defined margins, lobular, and heterogeneous, with reduced enhancement. High-grade PMEC can be difficult to differentiate from bronchial carcinoid tumors due to the hypervascularity of the tumor on CT images [6].
Bronchoscopy is commonly used to define the localization and obtain a biopsy for a definitive diagnosis. Macroscopically, PMEC cells include mucous, epidermoid, and intermediate cells, lacking in keratinization

[10]. The extracellular spaces are formed by the tumor cells and contain a mucoid substance [9]. High-grade tumors have increased nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, and cellular necrosis but reduced mucoid substances and vessels compared with low-grade PMEC [9].
Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for patients with PMEC [11]. Multiple surgical approaches can be utilized, including lo­ bectomy, segmental resection, or endoscopic removal, depending on the location and the extension of the tumor [11]. Adjuvant therapy is not indicated for cases of low-grade PMEC with complete resection [4]. No evidence currently supports the efficacy of chemotherapy or radio­ therapy against high-grade PMEC, although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy has been suggested for unresectable or high-grade PMEC [12]. Low-grade PMEC is associated with a good prognosis and a 5-year survival rate of up to 95%, whereas high-grade PMEC is associated with a worse prognosis [3,10].
The patient in this article was a child who presented with respiratory tract obstruction symptoms and had been misdiagnosed with asthma for a long time. After complete tumor resection, the histological results revealed a low-grade PMEC; therefore, the patient was not indicated to receive adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The symptoms of res­ piratory obstruction were completely solved by tumor removal.
4. Conclusion
Children who present with PMEC are rare, and the symptoms are often similar to other lung diseases, leading to delayed diagnosis. Chest CT scans may help determine the cause and exclude differential di­ agnoses, such as asthma and pneumonia. Most PMEC cases have a good prognosis, and a timely diagnosis and treatment may improve the overall survival rate of the patient.

111In-leukocyte scintigraphy has generally been considered a sensitive diagnostic test for the evaluation of infectious or inflammatory processes in the abdomen due to a lack of normal physiologic bowel activity. Herein we present a case of a patient status post endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm for which an 111In-leukocyte scan was ordered to assess for graft infection. Planar imaging revealed an abnormal focus of radiotracer activity in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. A SPECT-CT obtained to further delineate the anatomic location of abnormal activity showed abnormal leukocyte activity localizing to the terminal ileum secondary to a micro-perforation from an ingested fishbone. This case underscores the principle that in the absence of known intra-abdominal pathology, 111Inleukocyte activity in the abdomen should always be considered abnormal, and that further evaluation with dedicated cross-sectional imaging should be performed to assist with the localization of abnormal activity.

Introduction
111In-leukocyte scintigraphy has generally been considered a sensitive diagnostic test for the evaluation of infectious or inflammatory processes in the abdomen due to a lack of normal physiologic bowel activity. Protocols vary, but the most common method involves performing in vitro labeling of the

patient's leukocytes before injecting the labeled cells intravenously. Subsequently, gamma camera whole-body planar imaging is acquired. Additional spot views can be obtained as necessary, and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) combined with computed tomography (CT) of the same body region is often utilized to further localize any abnormal activity seen on planar imaging. As with many nuclear medicine imaging agents, 111In-leukocyte scintigraphy offers

the advantage of imaging a physiologic process with the ability to relate these findings to patient anatomy.

Case report

A 77-year-old with a history of an 11 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm status post endovascular repair was found to have an enlarging aneurysmal sac on a routine surveillance CT angiogram. No obvious endoleak was identified; however, there was a new irregular soft tissue density with adjacent fat stranding along the wall of the excluded aneurysmal sac that was concerning for impending rupture. Although the patient was asymptomatic and laboratory values were normal at the time, they were referred for an 111In-leukocyte scan to exclude infection as the source of this abnormality. An anterior whole body planar 111In-leukocyte emission scan showed no abnormal activity in the central abdomen to suggest a graft or focal aortic infection. However, there was a subtle focus of increased radiotracer activity within the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, as well as subtle activity extending along the course of colon (Fig. 1A). A SPECT/CT of the abdomen and pelvis was subsequently acquired to better evaluate the source of this activity. An axial fused SPECT/CT image showed a focus of increased 111In-leukocyte activity in the terminal ileum that corresponded to the abnormality seen on the planar image. No activity was associated with the region of soft tissue thickening and adjacent retroperitoneal fat stranding along the left anterolateral aspect of the excluded aneurysmal sac (Fig. 1B). Dedicated axial CT images of the terminal ileum showed a linear hyperdensity within the bowel with associated wall thickening, inflammatory fat stranding, and multiple adjacent locules of extra-luminal gas (Fig. 1C-1D). Given the constellation of findings, the patient was diagnosed with an ileal micro-perforation from an ingested fish bone. Fortunately, the patient remained asymptomatic and could be managed conservatively. A magnified axial CT image of the terminal ileum acquired at follow-up 3 months later showed resolution of the ileal inflammation, two contained micro-perforations, and an absence of the previously visualized fish bone (Fig. 1E).

Fig. 1 - 111In-leukocyte whole-body planar image (A) showing a subtle focus of abnormal radiotracer activity in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen (arrowhead). Axial SPECT-CT (B) and axial CTA (C) images show an absence of radiotracer activity at the region of concern identified on recent CT angiogram (arrow); however, there is abnormal radiotracer activity localizing to the terminal ileum (arrowhead). Magnified axial CT image of the terminal ileum (D) shows a linear hyperdensity representing a fishbone with associated inflammation and locules of extraluminal gas. Magnified axial CT at follow-up 3 months after initial imaging (E) shows absence of the previously identified fishbone with resolution of the inflammation and locules of extraluminal gas.

Discussion
Although intestinal perforation is a rare complication of foreign body ingestion, fish bones are the most common cause when it does occur [1-3]. Once a bone passes through the stomach, perforation can occur anywhere along length of the bowel, but typically occurs in areas of acute angulation such as the ileocecal or rectosigmoid junctions [1,4]. Bowel perforation leading to acute abdomen results in significant morbidity and mortality both in the acute and chronic settings, and therefore timing of early detection and prompt management is crucial as it relates to patient outcomes. Computed tomography (CT) is the preferred modality to evaluate these patients with suspected complications of foreign body ingestion [5]. CT findings can be very subtle, and in the absence of obvious sec-

ondary signs of inflammation, the physiologic significance of foreign body ingestion can be unclear. As such, this case illustrates an exceedingly rare diagnosis made via 111In-leukocyte scintigraphy, which is even rarer in an asymptomatic individual, and showed evidence of active inflammation on scintigraphy despite no obvious secondary signs of inflammation on CT alone. When the diagnosis is unclear or when there is uncertainty about the significance of focal abdominal activity on scintigraphy, SPECT/CT should be utilized to localize the source of abnormal activity [6]. Furthermore, this case highlights the importance of recognizing that 111In-leukocyte activity within the abdomen, no matter how subtle, is abnormal, and may represent a potential source of patient morbidity [7-9] .

Protocol for intranasal chemoprevention delivery in a urethane mouse lung cancer model

Mouse iloprost lung cancer chemoprevention studies typically use oral delivery. Here, we present a protocol for intranasal iloprost delivery within a urethane lung adenocarcinoma mouse model. We detail steps for intraperitoneal urethane injection in mice, followed by nine-week monitoring, intranasal iloprost treatment, and lungs harvesting for analysis. This iloprost delivery approach parallels an ongoing phase II clinical trial of inhaled iloprost for lung cancer chemoprevention. This protocol diversifies options for chemoprevention studies and offers a relevant and translatable model.
Publisher's note: Undertaking any experimental protocol requires adherence to local institutional guidelines for laboratory safety and ethics.

BEFORE YOU BEGIN Institutional permissions All studies with animals must be conducted in accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the appropriate institutional IACUC committee. An SOP for urethane must also be in place to protect humans handling urethane injections or exposed mice.
All described experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All experiments were approved by the Rocky Mountain VA Medical Center Veterinary Medical Unit IACUC and conducted with an SOP for use of urethane in animal studies.
Mice
Timing: Depends on animal facility process
1. Order 8-10 week old, female mice. a. Allow mice to acclimate for two weeks before beginning the experiment. b. Mice should be maintained on hardwood bedding in a 12 h light/dark cycle with a standard mouse lab diet and water ad libitum. c. The number of mice depends on study endpoints and whether multiple samples will be collected from a single mouse, but the chemoprevention protocol typically requires group sizes of 7-10 to achieve significance.
Note: Urethane can be used as a carcinogen in many strains of mice but intranasal iloprost has only been tested in the FVB/N and A/J strains. Selection of strain should be based, when

possible, on previous studies of the carcinogen and chemoprevention agent. Female FVB/N mice are preferred due to aggression associated with increased handling of male mice. Different strains of mice may have different behavior patterns and both sexes could be used. Susceptibility to urethane varies between strains but resistance to urethane can be overcome with increased urethane injections (Miller et al., 2003).

CRITICAL: Urethane is a hazardous chemical and must have an SOP for use with animals. Urethane exposure can lead to birth defects, eye irritation, respiratory damage, and skin damage and can affect the liver, bone marrow, and reproductive system. Cages with urethane exposed mice should be identified and all work with urethane or urethane exposed animals should be performed in a fume hood or safety cabinet. Bedding should be disposed of in biohazard trash. Mask, gown, eye protection, and gloves should be used while working with urethane. Isoflurane is a halogenated anesthetic gas used to anesthetize research animals. Waste anesthetic gases must be properly scavenged or exhausted. Short-term overexposure may result in irritation of the eyes, skin and respiratory tract, cough, sore throat, and may impair consciousness and motor skills. Overexposure can lead to adverse effects on the liver, kidneys, and reproductive system.
Alternatives: Other intranasal administered chemoprevention agents can be used with this protocol but should be optimized for dose and delivery timing. Intranasal iloprost could be used to prevent lesions induced by other carcinogens but should be optimized for timing when combined with other protocols.

STEP-BY-STEP METHOD DETAILS Urethane injection
Timing: 2 h (depending on number of mice); injections completed in the morning
In this step, urethane is injected to initiate the carcinogenesis process. Saline injections are used in control animals. FVB/N or A/J mice are administered with one intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 1 mg urethane/g body weight dissolved in 0.9% saline.
1. Weigh mice and record weights. 2. Prepare urethane.
a. Stock urethane is stored at 20-25C for up to two years. Urethane should be diluted the morning of the injections and can be stored at 20-25C for eight hours.
b. Use the table below to determine the required volume and concentration of urethane solutions based on mouse weights and number of mice in each weight category.
c. Weigh urethane calculated from the table into pre-tared tubes. d. Add sterile saline and vortex to dissolve urethane. e. Sterile filter solution into new sterile tubes.

3. Inject urethane or saline. a. Fill a new sterile syringe with needle (25 gauge, 5/8 inch) with 100 mL of the appropriate urethane concentration for each mouse according to its weight. b. Put mouse cages in a biosafety cabinet, remove a mouse to identify and verify its weight with recorded weights, swab abdomen with 70% alcohol, and inject urethane IP (Figure 1). c. For saline control injections, fill a new sterile syringe with needle with 100 mL sterile saline, remove a mouse to identify, swab abdomen with 70% alcohol, and inject IP. d. Return mice to cage and monitor hourly until fully recovered.
CRITICAL: Urethane is an anesthetic and mice should experience lethargy within minutes of injection that persists for 1-5 h. Mice do not lose the ability to right themselves or to maintain body heat but assess the mice for ability to right themselves before beginning hourly monitoring. Mice regain activity and show no negative effects of injection within a few hours. Any mice which become unresponsive or fail to recover should be euthanized, but this is an extremely rare event. Troubleshooting 1. Technical expertise with IP injections is key to consistent experimental results. Personnel should wear appropriate PPE when working with urethane or urethane exposed animals and their bedding and SOPs should be established with individual IACUCs.

Figure 1. Urethane exposure Urethane is delivered by a 100 mL IP injection as a 1 mg/g body weight dose to 8-10 week old mice. Control mice are injected IP with 100 mL saline. Mice become lethargic and are monitored during recovery but do not lose ability to right themselves or regulate body heat.

Protocol

Note: Dissolving urethane in saline requires extensive mixing and care should be taken to ensure complete dissolution. Dosing for other strains of mice or other carcinogens should be determined experimentally or from published studies. Plan to deliver 1 mg/g body weight in 100 mL volume sterile saline to each mouse. For example, for 20 mice weighing 24 grams each, 480 mg of urethane would be dissolved in 2 mL of sterile saline. At the low dose of urethane used in this protocol, mice are lethargic for only a short time and do not lose the ability to right themselves or regulate body heat. Heated cages or heating pads can be used if animals need assisted recovery.
Monitor animals
Timing: For 14 weeks after urethane injection
Animals are monitored daily for the first week and weekly thereafter during lesion development for overall health. This step ensures humane treatment of the animals and can identify early in the study any major problems (Figure 2).
4. Weigh mice and record weights daily for the first week after urethane injection. a. Evaluate animals who approach 15% weight loss. Determine if nutritional support is appropriate. b. Euthanize animals who have more than 15% weight loss or are demonstrating sick rodent postures, abdominal distension, a black-hued abdomen, or difficulty breathing. Necropsy when indicated to determine cause of death.
5. Weigh mice and record weights weekly for weeks 2-14 after urethane injection. a. Evaluate animals who approach 15% weight loss. Determine if nutritional support is appropriate. b. Euthanize animals who have more than 15% weight loss or are demonstrating sick rodent postures, abdominal distension, a black-hued abdomen, or difficulty breathing. Necropsy when indicated to determine cause of death.
Note: Depending on the strain, some mice are more strongly affected by urethane toxicity and need additional nutritional support (treats) or monitoring. Before conducting carcinogen

Figure 2. Mouse health monitoring As with all chemical carcinogen protocols, mice are monitored closely for signs of declining health. For the first week after urethane injection, mice are weighed daily and evaluated for pain or distress. Thereafter and until sacrifice, mice are weighed weekly and evaluated daily for pain or distress. Weight loss is the most common sign of declining health in urethane studies.
studies, lab experience or the literature should be used to estimate the risk of off-target health effects in specific strains. Necropsies of animals euthanized before study endpoint may identify areas for technical improvement or susceptibilities in specific strains. Our recommended weight loss cutoff of 15% for humane euthanasia are included in the steps above and were established by our experience and preference of institutional veterinary staff. Investigators should establish weight loss thresholds with individual institutional IACUCs.
Administer intranasal iloprost
Timing: At week 9 after urethane injection; 1 h (to treat, depending on animal number)/ day, 5 days/week, for 5 weeks
In this step, intranasal iloprost is administered as a chemopreventive agent to reduce development of premalignant lesions and carcinomas. Monitoring of overall animal health, as described above, continues throughout iloprost administration.
6. Prepare iloprost. a. Stock iloprost is stored at -20C for up to one year. Diluted Iloprost should be prepared immediately before use at 20-25C and not stored beyond the time required for administration. b. Dilute iloprost in sterile saline to achieve a concentration of 5 mg/100 mL and the volume needed for 100 mL per mouse. c. Use a sterile syringe and needle to collect iloprost from vial. d. Add sterile saline to a sterile tube at a volume of 100 mL per control mouse. e. Use a sterile syringe and needle (or other sterile approach) to collect saline from stock container.
7. Administer intranasal iloprost. a. Anesthetize mice with isoflurane (3% in oxygen) according to institutional guidelines. b. Once mice have stopped moving and are breathing slowly and deeply (3-4 min), load a p200 pipette with 100 mL iloprost or saline solution. c. Hold the mouse by its ears and tilt its head back. Deliver a drop of solution to the edge of the mouse's nare (Figure 3).
STAR Protocols 3, 101750, December 16, 2022 5

ll
OPEN ACCESS
Figure 3. Intranasal iloprost administration Iloprost is delivered nine weeks after the urethane injection. Mice are anesthetized with isolflurane (3% in oxygen) and 5 mg of Iloprost is delivered by two 50 mL doses, one to each nare of the mouse. Control mice are administered two 50 mL doses of saline. Treatments occur 5 days/week for five weeks. Recovery from the brief dose of anesthetic is quick and when mice are confirmed to be breathing normally and awakening, they are returned to their home cage.
d. Wait for the mouse to inhale the solution, then apply more until 50 mL have been dispensed. e. Deliver the second 50 mL to the other nare. f. Before returning the mouse to its cage, make sure it is breathing regularly. If not, tap on its
chest or back or move it around gently. g. Ensure mouse is waking up before returning cage to housing. 8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 to deliver iloprost five days per week for five weeks. 9. Monitor animals during iloprost treatment weeks according to urethane guidelines (step 5).
CRITICAL: Training and practice with intranasal delivery should be conducted with saline before an experiment is initiated to establish efficient and swift technique. Initial attempts may result in solution dripping into the mouth and being breathed in or swallowed through the mouth.
Optional: In this model, mice receive 5 mg of iloprost in 100 mL five days/week for five weeks. The combination of iloprost with other carcinogens or in different strains may require alternate dosing. Chemoprevention agents can be delivered in smaller volume depending on required concentration and solubility. Iloprost can be requested from Cayman Chemical in different formulations depending on experimental needs.
Note: The 5 day/week administration of 5 mg/100 mL iloprost/saline parallels dosing of iloprost in humans, but if needed, alternative dosing schedules that reduce animal-human contact could be tested for efficacy. Dosing for other strains of mice or other chemopreventive agents should be determined experimentally or from published studies. Concentrated agents may result in nasal irritation, so a pilot study should be conducted with new agents to ensure mice can tolerate the desired dose. Work quickly when delivering agents intranasally because mice quickly recover from their brief exposure to isoflurane. If intranasal iloprost administration is slow and mice are receiving longer delivery of gas anesthetic, heated cages or heating pads can be used to support recovery.
Study endpoint
Timing: 14 weeks after urethane (depends on experiment parameters); harvest time depends on sample collection needs
Hyperplasia and adenomas begin to appear 3-6 weeks after urethane injection in FVB/N mice. At 14-16 weeks, FVB/N have 3-6 adenomas >1 mm and adenocarcinoma appears after 30 weeks. This step counts lesions and collects samples for analysis. Standard protocols for lung lesion and tissue harvest have been previously published. (Sozio et al., 2021; Davenport et al., 2020) Exact protocols for harvest depend on the specific study and samples being collected.

Figure 4. Sample collection 14 weeks after the urethane injection, mice are sacrificed by pharmacologic euthanasia and exsanguination. (A) The thoracic cavity is opened. (B) The rib cage is cut through the sternum and separated. The lungs are perfused with cold saline solution. (C) The trachea is cut and connective tissue is separated to facilitate removal of the lungs. (D) Lung, tracheal, and lesion tissue can be collected according to study needs.
a. Mice are injected IP with 200 mg/kg Fatal Plus and when animals are unresponsive to toe pinch, blood samples can be collected by cardiac puncture with a syringe and needle (25 g 3 5/8) and processed for downstream analysis.
b. Death is confirmed by exsanguination and cessation of heartbeat and breathing in accordance with IACUC guidelines.
c. Spray mouse with 70% ethanol, cut open skin to expose thoracic and abdominal cavity, cut the inferior vena cava, and expose the lungs by cutting through the rib cage (Figure 4).
d. Perfuse the lungs with cold saline solution in a 5 mL syringe by inserting the syringe into the right heart ventricle. Perfusion is indicated by lung inflation and white color of the tissue.
e. Sample collection. i. Lungs can be inflated with 10% formalin for fixation and the trachea tied off before removal. ii. Alternatively, use a hemostat to clamp the left bronchus, remove the left lobe for fresh or frozen analysis, and then proceed with inflating the right lung with formalin. iii. Lobes can be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored in nucleic acid preservative (RNA Later) for nucleic acid extraction, or processed for fresh tissue or cell analysis. iv. Alternatively, whole lung can be dissected by holding the trachea and gently removing connective tissue around the lungs, leaving them intact. v. Whole lung can be transferred to saline or formalin, depending on downstream analysis.
f. Troubleshooting 2, troubleshooting 3.
CRITICAL: Pharmaceutical overdose should be used for mouse euthanasia to protect airway and lung tissue from damage or physiological alterations (for example, Fatal Plus or ketamine/xylazine). Alternatively, CO2 with cervical dislocation can be used for euthanasia.
Optional: Our experience is with harvesting lesions and tissues after urethane and iloprost at 14 weeks, but depending on the experimental plan, the harvest could be conducted at a later time point. If fixed tissue analysis is planned, the simplest approach is to add animals to each group for fixation of the whole lung. It is possible to tie off and remove the left lobe for biochemical analysis and fix only the right lobe, but if tumor counting is an endpoint, the
STAR Protocols 3, 101750, December 16, 2022 7

ll
OPEN ACCESS
left lung should be counted immediately after removal and the right fixed lung should be serially sectioned at 5 mm and every tenth slide analyzed for lesions (about 15 slides per mouse).
EXPECTED OUTCOMES A single urethane injection leads to an average of 4-6 adenomas in FVB/N and 20-30 in A/J after 14 weeks, which is reduced by intranasal iloprost treatment to an average of 2-3 (Sompel et al., 2022; Tennis et al., 2022).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS To achieve statistical significance, groups of 7-10 are typically required. All lesion counts from the five lobes are combined and comprise lesion multiplicity for that mouse. Tumor size can also be recorded using a digital caliper. Histologic analysis of lung tissue can be done to identify hyperplasia, microadenoma, adenomas, and adenocarcinoma using imaging. Lesion morphology and grading should be determined by two independent, blinded reviewers. Mouse weights, differences in lesion number or size, or endpoint assays can generally be analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc analysis or a two-tailed Student's t-test. While not common, animals found to have significant lung disease (i.e., pneumonia) on observation of lung tissue or on H&E besides adenomas or tumors can be excluded from analysis as the comorbidity often affects relevant data points.
LIMITATIONS While it is a well-established mouse lung carcinogen, use of urethane as a carcinogen can be affected by environmental conditions, mouse strain, or animal stress or undiagnosed illness, leading to unexpected rates of death or lack of tumor induction. Additional chemical lung carcinogens that have been used in chemoprevention studies include cigarette smoke, benzo(a)pyrene, and nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone. (Keith et al., 2004; Kassie et al., 2022; Islam et al., 2022).
TROUBLESHOOTING Problem 1 Lack of lethargy after urethane injection.
Potential solution Lack of lethargy after urethane injection suggests incorrect injection technique, incorrect dosing, or compromised urethane (after step 2). If it is determined than an error in urethane preparation occurred, urethane can be prepared again, and animals reinjected the next day. Other sources of error should be corrected with training or a new lot of urethane before animals are injected again. To avoid compromised urethane, dispose of the reagent when it reaches two years old.
Problem 2 Lack of lesions at study endpoint.
Potential solution FVB/N and A/J mice are well described as developing early adenomatous lesions at 16-20 weeks after urethane and adenocarcinoma by 30 weeks after urethane. If lesions are not present (step 7), the specific strain of mice may need more urethane, for example, C57/B6 mice require six injections of urethane to develop adenocarcinoma. Sensitivity to urethane has been described for many strains of mice (Miller et al., 2003; Titis and Forkert, 2001; Dwyer-Nield et al., 2010). Compromised urethane may also reduce lesion development.
Problem 3 Animal death before study endpoint.

OPEN ACCESS

Potential solution In our experience, FVB/N mice may have up to 10% premature death rate from urethane after urethane injections. This occurs sporadically and the cause has not been identified. The toxicity appears as a distended and/or discolored abdomen about 4 days after urethane exposure, followed by weight loss requiring euthanasia. Other strains may experience less premature death, but some death is expected. Mice do not die or are euthanized early due to tumor development, as studies in chemoprevention conclude before any animal experiences significant tumor burden. Compromised urethane may lead to lack of response or toxicity, so we recommend replacing urethane within two years after purchase.

The Importance of Virology at a Time of Great Need and Great Jeopardy

As we enter 2015, one needs to look no farther than the daily news reports to appreciate the ongoing burden of viral diseases. Last year, Ebola reemerged in West Africa, claiming thousands of lives and affecting many thousands more. Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) continue to be reported, with the possibility of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like epidemic ever present. Chikungunya virus has spread to the Western Hemisphere, and the infection is now epidemic in the Caribbean and southern United States. We are also living in a world in which hundreds of millions of people are chronically infected with hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV, respectively). The rate of new HIV infections has declined, but millions remain infected, and it, too, has already cut short far too many lives. Viruses account for up to 20% of all human cancers, and although a large percentage of new human papillomavirus (HPV) and HBV infections can now be prevented by vaccination, many are already infected, and the vaccines are not being used to their full potential. We are in the middle of our annual encounter with influenza virus, never knowing when the next strain to which there is little or no preexisting immunity will arise. In 2014-2015, a mismatch between the H3N2 strain in the influenza vaccine and the circulating virus has led to a poorly protective vaccine, which highlights the need for new vaccines. In recent months, there has been a recurrence of measles in the United States associated with a refusal by some parents to vaccinate their children, and the outbreak continues at the time of this writing (1). This accounting is of only some viruses and is limited to those that infect humans!
There can be no argument that humankind's best hope of preventing and treating these diseases comes from a vigorous research enterprise. Vannevar Bush recognized this after World War II in the landmark report "Science, the Endless Frontier," in which he convinced the U.S. government that investment in basic research at universities would yield tremendous dividends (https:// www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm). Indeed, we have now almost eliminated polio due to the development of vaccines and have converted HIV infection from a certain death sentence to a largely manageable state, and, as mentioned above, we have our first anticancer vaccines by preventing some viral infections. The tremendous reduction in mortality from such diseases as variola, measles, and rubella came about only because the causative viruses were identified, cultivated, attenuated, and made into effective vaccines by biomedical research. In addition to having applied these practical findings, we have gained important fundamental insights into the biology not only of viruses but also of the cells that they infect, and that information is being applied to find cures against other diseases, such as cancer. All these advances, and more, have come about because of public trust in science and investment in scientific research.

Despite all this good news, much remains to be done. It was recently estimated that there are 320,000 mammalian viruses (2), many of which may have the potential for human transmission. Even if only a small fraction of these viruses can jump into humans and cause disease, humanity is living under a tremendous threat from viral zoonoses. Less expensive drugs are needed for treating those with viral infections such as hepatitis C. While the HPV vaccine can prevent many infections, there are viral types that are not covered by the vaccine, and many millions of people were infected before the vaccine came on the market. Infections with numerous other viruses are not treatable due to the lack of effective antivirals. Clearly, vaccines against HIV, hepatitis C, and Ebola, to name a few, would save countless lives. New pathogens continue to emerge, and existing nonviral pathogens become resistant to common antibiotics. Hence, we are living at a time of great need for the discipline of virology.
We think that the field of virology and, by extension, the field of microbiology are at a critical crossroads. Funding for research in the United States and elsewhere is stagnant, if not losing pace with inflation. Working with the most pathogenic organisms requires even higher costs and is heavily regulated. Some senior scientists are rethinking their career choices, and there is growing concern that young scientists will be discouraged from entering the field, especially in areas of controversial research, such as studies of the transmissibility of highly pathogenic influenza viruses (3). While some have argued that virology is a dying field, that assertion has been elegantly refuted by Dan DiMaio (4). Adding to these stresses, scientists and society are struggling with a new antiintellectual movement that challenges scientific conclusions, from anthropomorphically induced climate change to the absence of any link between vaccines and autism. The rise of antivaccine movements is of particular concern to society, for reduced vaccination rates threaten to undermine some of the greatest accomplishments of virology and public health in the 20th century. The combination of reduced funding, increased regulation, experimental controversies, and the emerging antiscience intellectual milieu is a toxic blend that makes this time one of great jeopardy for virology.
While we scientists cannot directly control funding or regulations, we can take charge of some aspects of the research enterprise in a way to ensure that it continues to benefit society. First, we can

continue to advocate for better funding by the Federal Government. This requires engaging our elected officials both directly and indirectly by continuing to educate them and the public at large about the importance of fundamental research in infectious diseases. The advocacy group Research!America has a number of helpful tips on its website (http://www.researchamerica.org). Second, we need to demonstrate to the public that we are being good stewards of their investment by working safely in the laboratory. There have been a number of high-profile biosafety lapses over the past year, and the negative publicity surrounding these events may lead to more regulation and less funding support for exactly the types of research that we most critically need. We therefore argue that each of us needs to pay special attention to biosafety in 2015 and the longer term. Third, in controversial areas, such as studies of transmissibility involving pathogens with pandemic potential, it needs to be clearly articulated why some types of experiments need to be done by vigorously engaging in scientific debate using the tools of science, all the while acknowledging that there are risks and taking every step to mitigate those risks. Third, every scientist needs to become a foot soldier in confronting the pervasive spread of antiscientific attitudes, such as the antivaccination movement,

which threaten to undermine the great advances society has made in so many aspects of everyday life, including reducing mortality from many infectious diseases. Although virology is currently at the epicenter of these converging storms, the issues that it faces are relevant to all of microbiology and, by extension, to all of science and the society that it serves. A little added effort on our parts will go a long way to ensuring continued public confidence in what we do to make their lives healthier.

Background: Understanding socio-demographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis can inform priorities for cancer control. Patients and methods: We analysed data on the stage at diagnosis of East of England patients diagnosed with any of 10 common cancers, 2006-2010. Stage information was available on 88 657 of 98 942 tumours (89.6%). Results: Substantial socio-demographic inequalities in advanced stage at diagnosis (i.e. stage III/IV) existed for seven cancers, but their magnitude and direction varied greatly by cancer: advanced stage at diagnosis was more likely for older patients with melanoma but less likely for older patients with lung cancer [odds ratios for 75-79 versus 65-69 1.60 (1.38-1.86) and 0.83 (0.77-0.89), respectively]. Deprived patients were more likely to be diagnosed in advanced stage for melanoma, prostate, endometrial and (female) breast cancer: odds ratios (most versus least deprived quintile) from 2.24 (1.66-3.03) for melanoma to 1.31 (1.15-1.49) for breast cancer. In England, elimination of sociodemographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis could decrease the number of patients with cancer diagnosed in advanced stage by 5600 annually. Conclusions: There are substantial socio-demographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis for most cancers. Earlier detection interventions and policies can be targeted on patients at higher risk of advanced stage diagnosis. Key words: cancer, demographic, diagnosis, inequalities, socio-economic, stage

introduction
Eliminating population exposure to known lifestyle and environmental risk factors would only prevent up to 45% of all new diagnoses of cancer, and this potential may not be achievable for many years [1]. Therefore, in addition to primary prevention efforts to decrease cancer incidence, current cancer control policies aim to reduce the proportion of patients diagnosed at advanced disease stage. Early-stage detection renders currently available treatments more effective and can therefore amplify the impact of primary prevention initiatives to help decrease cancer-related deaths [2, 3].
However, the evidence about how to achieve earlier stage detection is still developing [3]. The great majority of cancer patients are diagnosed after first presenting to a general

practitioner with symptoms relating to their cancer [4]. In those patients, interventions to improve awareness and appraisal of cancer symptoms could help to decrease the time interval between symptom onset and presentation to a doctor [5]. Such interventions could be further targeted and tailored on population groups at higher risk of advanced stage diagnosis, for example older women (who are at higher risk of late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer compared with younger women) [6, 7] or men (who are at higher risk of late-stage diagnosis of melanoma compared with women) [8]. For cancers with large socio-demographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis, such targeting may be judged particularly appropriate. However, for most common cancers, up-to-date UK evidence about whether socio-demographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis exist and their magnitude and direction is limited.
Against this background, we set out to examine sociodemographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis for 10 common cancers. Our aim was to explore and characterise variation in

data
We analysed information on the stage at diagnosis of East of England patients with cancer aged 30 years or over with a new diagnosis of (International Classification of Diseases-10 code): colon (C18), rectal (C19-20), lung (C34), melanoma (C43), female breast (C50), endometrial (C54), ovarian (C56), prostate (C61), renal (C64) and bladder (C67) cancer during 2006-2010. This represents the longest most recent period for which stage information was available with high completeness for all 10 cancers. Together, the respective cancer sites represent 67% of new cancer diagnoses in England (2009) and 57% of all cancer deaths. Anonymous data were extracted from the Eastern Cancer Registration and Information Centre (ECRIC), a cancer registry covering a population of 5.7 m. This registry has an excellent record of registration quality as indicated by measures, such as death-certificate only registrations of 0.02% in 2010 compared with an average national rate of 1.6% [9]. Uniquely among English cancer registries, currently it holds stage at diagnosis information for a high proportion of tumours [10]. As part of the registration process, stage at diagnosis was assigned by CHB and BAR, based on clinical, imaging and pathological information according to the TNM classification [11]. Information on the income domain of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2004 score of the Lower Super Output Area of patients' residence at diagnosis was available as part of the registration record and was subsequently used to define socio-economic status quintiles (1 = least deprived, or `affluent'; 5 = most deprived) [12]. The use of this index (i.e. of the income domain of IMD) is standard practice in UK cancer statistics and research because it avoids the potential for endogeneity between health outcomes (e.g. cancer stage at diagnosis) and composite (multidimensional) deprivation measures already incorporating measures of health deprivation.
analysis
The main analysis was confined to patients with known stage (complete case analysis). We defined advanced stage at diagnosis as diagnosis in stages III/IV. We used a two-step modelling approach, which allows us to examine overall socio-demographic differences before investigating how they vary by cancer [13].
Initially, a logistic regression model was used to predict advanced stage diagnosis, adjusting for age group (65-69-year olds used as reference), gender (men as reference), deprivation quintile (least deprived group as reference), cancer (rectal cancer as reference); tumour type (morphology); and for breast, colon and rectal cancers, whether the cancer was detected symptomatically or by screening (diagnosis of cancer within 90 days from a screening episode defined screening-detected cancers). We used this initial model which only included main effect variables to summarise overall associations between age, gender and deprivation with advanced stage at diagnosis across all studied cancers. Because of interactions between sociodemographic variables and cancer (P < 0.001 for all), in subsequent analysis we used a series of separate logistic regression models for each cancer.
We assessed the robustness of the findings using different sensitivity analyses. We re-ran the initial model using different definitions of advanced stage categories, i.e. diagnosis in stages II-IV versus stage I; or in stage IV versus stages I-III. We also explored potential confounding of gender, deprivation and age inequalities by ethnicity by repeating the analysis adjusting for ethnic group in the two-thirds of all patients for whom ethnicity information was available. We explored potential bias

arising from missing stage information using multiple imputation of missing stage repeating the analysis in a complete dataset including patients with imputed stage [7, 14, 15]. All exposure variables included in the analysis models were complete, and data were only missing for the outcome variable (stage). In this case, the analysis model will provide unbiased estimates of associations under the missing at random (MAR) assumption (that outcome data are MAR given the exposure variables). However, the MAR assumption can be made more reasonable if stage is imputed on additional variables to those used in the analysis. We therefore imputed stage using an imputation model including information on survival, tumour histological grade, basis of diagnosis (i.e. whether the diagnosis was verified with histology or not), and oestrogen receptor status (for patients with breast cancer only) in addition to all the variables used in the analysis models. Imputation variables were complete, except for grade and oestrogen receptor status (used in imputation models only). Survival was censored at 365 days so that a reasonably consistent approach was applied to patients of any age regarding competing mortality risk. For the imputation model to be congenial with the analysis, model imputation was stratified by cancer. Multiple imputation was conducted using chained equations which created 20 imputed datasets.
We illustrate the potential population health impact of the findings by estimating the number of cancers diagnosed in advanced stage in England annually that could be prevented by eliminating gender, deprivation and old age inequalities. Potential improvements were estimated only where there was significant variation. For the prediction of potential proportions, the odds ratio values for patients belonging to patient groups with higher probability of advanced stage diagnosis were set to that of the relevant group with the lowest odds ratios. As more deprived patients with cancer are under-represented in the East of England compared with the England average, we used inverse probability weights calculated using the national deprivation group-specific incidence of each cancer. We focused on the impact of eliminating age inequalities on patients aged 65 or over because this age group includes about two-thirds of all patients with cancer and because of concerns about poorer relative survival and avoidable excess cancer deaths in older patients [16, 17]. Confidence intervals for these impact values were estimated using a bootstrap with 1 000 replications, accounting for both the uncertainty in stage inequalities and the uncertainty in the distribution of different patient groups.
In order to account for the fact that patients may attend the same health care organisation and that some tumours occur in the same patient, we use a sandwich estimator throughout. All analysis was conducted in STATA 11 (StataCorp. 2009, College Station, TX), including using the ice and mim commands used for multiple imputation [18]. See also supplementary file S1, for additional details on methods, available at Annals of Oncology online.
results
In total, there were 98 942 patients diagnosed with a relevant cancer during the study period. Information on stage at diagnosis was available for 88 657 (89.6%) of all patients, and among those patients the proportion of those diagnosed in stages III/IV varied substantially by cancer (Table 1 and supplementary file S2, available at Annals of Oncology online).
Considering socio-demographic inequalities for all cancers together, there was strong evidence that advanced stage at diagnosis was less likely in women and more likely with increasing level of deprivation (P = 0.003 for gender and P < 0.001 for deprivation, Table 2). Advanced stage also varied by age (P < 0.001), being more likely in older age. There was strong evidence that the associations between advanced stage at

associations between age and stage at diagnosis varied greatly between cancers (Figure 2). Older patients with melanoma, prostate, endometrial and breast cancer were more likely to be diagnosed in advanced stage compared with patients aged 65-69 (P = 0.01 for endometrial and P < 0.001 for others). Conversely, older patients with bladder, lung and renal cancer were less likely to be diagnosed in advanced stage compared with 65-69-year-old patients (P = 0.002, P < 0.001, and P = 0.009, respectively).
The sensitivity analysis (carried out using the initial model) produced overall similar findings (supplementary files S3-S6, available at Annals of Oncology online). Multiple imputation produced similar findings to those obtained by complete case analysis for gender, deprivation and age inequalities, although it indicated a slight underestimation of associations with advanced stage diagnosis in older patients.
In England, there are 186 000 new diagnoses for the 10 studied cancers every year (2009), and we estimated (see Methods) that 73 000 (39%) of those cancers are diagnosed in advanced stage currently. For the seven cancers with evidence of socio-demographic variation in stage at diagnosis there are 146 000 new diagnoses, and we estimated that 52 000 (36%) of those cancers are diagnosed in advanced stage currently. If it were possible to eliminate all gender, deprivation and old age inequalities in stage at diagnosis, there would be 5600 fewer cases diagnosed in advanced stage in England annually (Table 4) representing 3% of all diagnoses of the 10 studied cancers. Alternatively, this figure represents an 8% reduction in the advanced stage cases of all 10 studied cancers, or an 11% reduction in the advanced stage cases of the seven cancers for which there was evidence of potential gains in early stage diagnosis. Prostate, melanoma and endometrial cancer have the largest proportional early diagnosis gains. About 5000 of those tumours (90%)

comprise reductions in advanced stage at diagnosis for prostate (2000 cancers), breast (1000 cancers), lung (1300 cancers) and melanoma (700 cancers), with colon, rectal and ovarian cancer contributing no cases.
discussion
We found substantial and potentially avoidable gender, deprivation and age inequalities in advanced stage diagnosis of seven common cancers and relatively limited sociodemographic variation in stage at diagnosis of three other cancers. Among cancers with substantial inequalities, the size and direction of differences in advanced stage diagnosis varied greatly by cancer. The results were robust to various assumptions investigated with sensitivity analyses, including adjustment for ethnic group. Multiple imputation of missing stage indicated that the effect of age in older patients may have been slightly underestimated. Potential elimination of sociodemographic inequalities could help diagnose a substantial number of patients with cancer in earlier stage. Although, in absolute terms, most of these earlier detection gains relate to four common cancers, there are also notable relative gains for endometrial cancer.
The findings should be interpreted taking into account evidence about the socio-demographic differences in awareness and appraisal of cancer symptoms; and on the promptness by which cancer is suspected in symptomatic patients with different cancers. For melanoma, breast and endometrial cancers the observed socio-demographic inequalities in advanced stage at diagnosis are unlikely to reflect delays in suspecting and investigating cancer after symptomatic presentation to a doctor: these cancers are among the `easiest to suspect and diagnose' and delays after presentation are limited [13, 19]. Therefore, inequalities in stage at diagnosis for those three cancers are likely to reflect socio-demographic differences in awareness and interpretation of cancer symptoms which have been previously described [20-22].
For lung, renal and bladder cancer, we observed `negative' age gradients in advanced stage at diagnosis among patients aged 65 or over (older patients having lower probability of diagnosis at advanced stage). Similar associations between older age and stage at diagnosis of lung cancer have been reported previously in both related and other patient populations [7, 19, 23]. These findings are unlikely to reflect improved awareness and appraisal of cancer symptoms for lung, renal and bladder cancer in older compared with younger patients. Healthcare factors however may be implicated. Older patients tend to have more co-morbidities, which may lead to incidental identification of lung or renal cancers through imaging investigations (e.g. by chest X-ray or abdominal ultrasound, respectively, for symptoms unrelated to cancer). This may reflect a paradoxical apparent benefit of increasing level of co-morbidity, similar to other improvements in care reported for patients with multiple conditions [24]. An alternative explanation may be that these patterns reflect cognitive or psychological barriers by the doctors in suspecting cancer in middle-aged patients.

*The models for these eight cancers (i.e. colon, rectal, lung, melanoma, female breast, ovarian, renal and bladder cancer) were adjusted for tumour type, gender
and screening detection status (as applicable) and age and deprivation. Deprivation was treated as a continuous variable. Age was treated as two continuous variables (above and below the reference group) included together in the model (see also supplementary file S1, available at Annals of Oncology online). The model for endometrial cancer was adjusted for tumour type and linear terms for young and old age groups (see footnote * above). For deprivation, both a linear and a squared term were included, given evidence that such parameterisation improved model fit (P = 0.023). The presented odds ratio values for each deprivation group are derived by the combination of the linear and the squared terms [i.e. odds ratio = 1.48 (95% CI 1.12-1.95) and odds ratio = 0.92 (95% CI 0.86-0.99), respectively]. The model for prostate cancer was adjusted for tumour type and linear terms for deprivation category and young age group (see footnote * above). Old age group was treated as a categorical variable, because of strong evidence that such parameterisation improved model fit (<0.001). CI, Confidence Interval.

symptoms before specialist referral exist (with younger patients more likely to be referred to hospital less promptly)--such patterns also exist for patients with lung, renal and bladder cancer [13]. Another hypothesis is that these three cancers have more (and perhaps more specific) symptoms in older age.

Given that there is no robust evidence to explain the inverse age inequalities in the stage at diagnosis of lung, renal and bladder cancer, research to establish the causes of these patterns should be considered a priority. If the mechanisms responsible for these inequalities are better understood, interventions to reduce

*Details are provided in Methods section. Note that the estimated potential combined impact of eliminating inequalities in stage at diagnosis by gender, deprivation and old age is not equal to the sum of the individual impacts because certain individuals may be subject to more than one inequality. No data shown for colon, rectal and ovarian cancer, because of no evidence of socio-demographic variation by gender (as applicable), deprivation or old age group (see Table 3).

advanced stage diagnosis in middle-aged patients with lung, renal and bladder cancer may be feasible.
The findings substantially amplify previous research [7, 23, 25-33]. Particular strengths of the present study are that it encompasses several common cancers; it examines old age alongside other socio-demographic inequalities; it takes into account potential confounding by tumour type, ethnicity and (for breast, colon and rectal cancer) screening detection status; it uses highly complete stage information and explores potential bias arising from missing information in sensitivity analysis; and it illustrates the population health impact of eliminating socio-demographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis. Adjustment for tumour type minimises the potential

for confounding of socio-demographic differences in stage at diagnosis by socio-demographic differences in tumour morphology because of differential prior long-term exposure to risk factors.
An important limitation is that (unlike adjusting for breast and colorectal screening status), it was not possible to adjust for whether patients with prostate cancer were diagnosed with or without symptoms [e.g. because of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in asymptomatic men]. There is ongoing uncertainty about the potential benefits of asymptomatic detection of prostate cancer [34]. Although the uptake of PSA testing in the UK is overall low, it is higher among older and least deprived patients [35]. Consequently, among symptomatic

patients, deprivation gradients in advanced stage of prostate cancer may be lower than those observed in our study; conversely, old age gradients may indeed be larger than those estimated by our study. Therefore, we urge caution against the potential for the prostate cancer findings to be dismissed as clinically unimportant. Melanoma, breast and prostate cancer in England have higher incidence among patients with higher socio-economic status [36], and it is likely that the observed higher frequency of advanced stage at diagnosis among more deprived patients partly reflects over-diagnosis of nonadvanced stage disease among the more affluent patients.
A further limitation is the lack of availability of national data with similarly high complete information on stage for the studied cancers and period: this prevented expanding the analysis to a wider population. The relatively small number of patients for some rarer cancers may have prevented the detection of moderate or small inequalities in stage at diagnosis (e.g. this may apply to gender and deprivation differences in stage at diagnosis of bladder cancer, Table 3). Incidence patterns by age and gender between the study population and England are very similar. However, there are relative fewer patients with cancer in the most deprived group in the study population. For this reason, weights accounting for this difference were used in the estimation of the population health impact of eliminating socio-demographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis.
Among the seven cancers with substantial sociodemographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis, the size and direction of these associations varied widely. This complexity may signal a substantial potential for achieving earlier detection by targeting interventions to improve awareness and appraisal of cancer signs and symptoms on specific population groups [6, 8]. Policymakers could consider targeted approaches focusing either on a cancer or a specific population group. For example, given strong deprivation, old age and gender inequalities for this cancer, melanoma awareness interventions could particularly target more deprived old men. Among older people, interventions may specifically focus on improving awareness and appraisal of symptoms and signs of cancers associated with age inequality as a `bundle' (e.g. `breast and endometrial cancer' awareness interventions for older women, or `melanoma and prostate' cancer awareness interventions for older men). National strategies can combine both cancer and population group approaches. Development and validation of new, tailored and more effective awareness interventions is likely to be required [6], given the persistence over time of some of these inequalities [21].
The absence of socio-demographic variation in stage at diagnosis of three cancers (colon, rectal and ovarian cancer) should not be interpreted as an indication that patient awareness interventions for those three cancers are not justified. Such interventions are currently being implemented for colorectal cancer [37], while evidence increasingly supports their consideration for ovarian cancer [38]. The findings need to be interpreted in relation to their temporal context (2006- 2010). Evidence from breast cancer and melanoma which both benefited from long-standing awareness campaigns indicates that when such interventions are effective [39], they tend to also generate health inequalities (younger and more affluent

original articles
people typically being able to benefit more so than older and less affluent people) [40]. Avoiding potential inequality that can be generated by future effective patient awareness campaigns about colorectal and ovarian cancer presents a challenge.
In conclusion, for most cancers, there are appreciable sociodemographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis, and this realisation can help motivate and support targeting of interventions on patients at higher risk.

Nomograms to predict survival of stage IV tongue squamous cell carcinoma after surgery
Wei Sun, MDa, Minghua Cheng, MDa, Shaohui Zhuang, MDa, Huimin Chen, MDb, Shaohui Yang, MDa, Zeting Qiu, MDa,

Abstract To develop clinical nomograms for prediction of overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients with stage IV tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) after surgery based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program database.
We collected data of resected stage IV TSCC patients from the SEER database, and divided them into the training set and validation set by 7:3 randomly. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis were adopted to distinguish independent risk factors for OS and CSS. Clinical nomograms were constructed to predict the 3-year and 5-year probabilities of OS and CSS for individual patients. Calibration curves and Harrell C-indices were used for internal and external validation.
A total of 1550 patients with resected stage IV TSCC were identified. No statistical differences were detected between the training and validation sets. Age, race, marital status, tumor site, AJCC T/N/M status, and radiotherapy were recognized as independent prognostic factors associated with OS as well as CSS. Then nomograms were developed based on these variables. The calibration curves displayed a good agreement between the predicted and actual values of 3-year and 5-year probabilities for OS and CSS. The C-indices predicting OS were corrected as 0.705 in the training set, and 0.664 in the validation set. As for CSS, corrected C-indices were 0.708 in the training set and 0.663 in the validation set.
The established nomograms in this study exhibited good accuracy and effectiveness to predict 3-year and 5-year probabilities of OS and CSS in resected stage IV TSCC patients. They are useful tools to evaluate survival outcomes and helped choose appropriate treatment strategies.

Committee on Cancer (AJCC), TSCC can be classified into AJCC stage I-IV.[2] Both treatment strategies and prognosis prediction for patients with TSCC are based on the AJCC TNM staging system.
When it comes to stage IV advanced TSCC, surgery is generally preferred as the initial step, and postoperative radiation therapy or chemoradiotherapy should be considered to control disease progress.[3,4] According to a retrospective study of 262 patients with base of tongue cancer, the 5-year disease-specific survival rates were 27% for stage IV.[5] However, the AJCC TNM staging system does not take other risk factors into account, including age, gender,
race, histological grade, surgical therapy, radiation therapy, and so on, which seriously affects the prediction of individual patient prognosis in some cancers.[6-8] Therefore, it is necessary to develop
a new model to make the accurate prognostic prediction of stage IV TSCC, especially for resected patients.
Currently, nomograms have been widely developed to estimate
individual prognosis of death and recurrence in many cancer types.[9-12] By creating a visualized graph of the predictive model, nomogram has been considered to be a strong tool for prediction. And it was proved to be more effective than the traditional staging system.[13-15] However, nomograms to individually predict survival of stage IV TSCC patients after surgery have been rarely studied yet.
In this study, in order to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) outcomes in patients with stage IV TSCC after surgery, we developed effective nomogram models

and validated it based on a large population-based database of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program.
2. Methods
2.1. Data sources
The SEER program covers approximately 30% of the population in the United States.[16,17] Author QZT received research data by SEERStat software after authorization (Reference number: 12738-Nov2016). The demographic, clinicopathological, and follow-up data of all the tongue cancer patients were extracted from the SEER database. The SEER database was publicly available and all the research data were de-identified. Moreover, the study complied with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. So, the approval was waived by the local ethics committee and the institutional review board, and no informed consents were needed.
2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
We identified patients with tongue cancer (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition [ICDO-3], anatomic code C01.9, C02.0, C02.1, C02.2, C02.3, C02.4, C02.8, C02.9) for our study. Patients were included when meeting the following criteria:
1. diagnosed between 2004 and 2011; 2. limited to squamous cell carcinoma (ICD-O-3, histologic code:
8050, 8051, 8052, 8070, 8071, 8072, 8073, 8074, 8075, 8076, 8081, 8082, 8083 and 8084); 3. aged between 18 and 80 years old at diagnosis; 4. diagnosed with AJCC TNM stage IV; 5. receiving definite surgical treatment.
Patients were excluded according to the following criteria:
1. unknown race or marital status information; 2. unknown histologic grade, TNM stage information; 3. unknown causes of death or unknown survival month; 4. surviving less than or equal to 1 month; 5. incomplete treatment information; 6. multiple primary tumors; 7. Autopsy or death certificate only cases.
2.3. Variable selection
Data of gender, age group, marital status, race, tumor site, histological grade, AJCC T status, AJCC N status, AJCC M status, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, causes of death, and survival months were collected from the SEER database. Age group was classified as 1st quartile (68-80 years old), 2nd quartile (61-67), 3rd quartile (53-60), 4th quartile (18-52). Marital status was classified as married and unmarried (including divorced, separated, single, widowed patients). Race was classified as white, black, and others. Tumor site was classified as base of tongue and other sites. Histologic grade was classified as grade I/ II and III/IV. AJCC tumor (T) status was classified as T1, T2, T3, and T4. AJCC node (N) status was classified as N0, N1, N2 and N3. AJCC metastasis (M) status was classified as M0 and M1.
2.4. Construction of the nomogram
We randomly divided all the included patients into the training set and validation set according to the ratio of 7:3. For OS

analysis, any cause of death was defined as events, and survivors were defined as censored events. For CSS analysis, deaths caused by tongue cancer were considered as events, and deaths by other causes or survivors were considered as censored events. We compared OS and CSS among different variables to get statistically significant characteristics associated with OS and CSS using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. After adjusting those significant variables in the multivariate Cox regression analysis, independent prognostic factors were discovered. Then an effective nomogram model for resected stage IV TSCC was constructed based on the training set.
2.5. Validation of the nomogram
The accuracy of the nomogram model was estimated by internal and external validation using the SEER training and validation sets. Bootstrap with 500 resamples and 5-fold cross-validation was performed. Calibration curves, plotting the predictive estimate of nomogram model against the actual observation, were created to evaluate the nomogram performance visually. The perfect predictions should fall on a 45-degree straight line passing through the origin, called the standard curve. The Harrell's concordance indices (C-index) were measured to quantify the predicting ability of model.[18] It ranged from 0.500 to 1.000, which meant from random chance to perfect discrimination.
2.6. Statistical analysis
All the data analysis was conducted by R statistical software version 3.4. We described categorical variables as frequencies and percentages. For categorical variables, we chose Pearson ChiSquared test and Fisher exact tests to detect the statistical difference. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to draw the survival curves. The log-rank test and Cox regression analysis were selected to sequentially distinguish independent risk factors for OS and CSS. All P values were 2-sided and P < .05 was considered significant.
3. Results
3.1. Baseline characteristics
As shown in Figure 1, according to the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria, we finally included 1550 eligible patients with resected stage IV TSCC. They were randomly divided into 1085 patients in the training set and 465 patients in the validation set. Table 1 showed the baseline demographic and clinicopathological information of these patients. There were no significant differences between the training and validation sets for all the characteristics (P > .05). As a whole, most patients are male (1,132, 73.0%), married (900, 58.1%), and white (1,305, 84.2%), respectively. A majority of patients were between 18 and 53 years old (529, 34.1%). Most patients were diagnosed with T2 (526, 33.9%), N2 (1,264, 81.5%), M0 (1,501, 96.8%) for the AJCC TNM status. For these stage IV TSCC patients after surgery, a majority of them received radiotherapy (1322, 85.3%) as well as chemotherapy (998, 64.4%).
3.2. Univariate survival analysis
Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate univariate prognostic factors of OS and CSS in resected stage IV TSCC patients. As Table 2 showed, gender, age, marital status, race, tumor site, histological grade, AJCC T status, AJCC N status, AJCC M

status, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were found to be significantly associated with OS by univariate analysis. Similarly, all the above-mentioned variables were also found to be significantly associated with CSS. The 3-year and 5-year subgroup survival rates for OS and CSS were shown in Table 2. All the statistically significant variables were next analyzed by the forward method in multivariate analysis. Figure 2 displayed the Kaplan-Meier survival curves of OS and CSS for some representative variables. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for other variables were shown as Figure S1, http://links.lww.com/MD/ D63.
3.3. Multivariate survival analysis
After adjustment in the multivariate Cox analysis, independent prognostic factors were discovered. As Table 3 showed, age group, marital status, race, tumor site, AJCC T status, AJCC N status, AJCC M status, and radiotherapy were found to be independent prognostic factors associated with OS (P < .05). Table 4 demonstrated that all these variables except marriage also acted as independent predictive factors associated with CSS (P < .05). When it came to therapies, patients receiving radiotherapy had better OS and CSS than those without radiotherapy (receiving vs not, HR [hazard ratio] 0.612, 95% CI [confidence interval] 0.496-0.756, P < .001 for OS; HR 0.610, 95% CI 0.485-0.768, P < .001 for CSS). To visualize the impact of radiotherapy on OS and CSS in different subgroups, forest plots were shown in Figure S2, http://links.lww.com/MD/

D63. These predictive variables were subsequently included to construct the nomogram models for resected stage IV TSCC.
3.4. Construction of nomogram
Based on the training set, nomograms predicting 3-year and 5year probabilities for OS and CSS were constructed using statistically significant variables from multivariate Cox analysis, as shown in Figure 3. Table S1, http://links.lww.com/MD/D63 displayed the numeric score of each variable for the 2 nomograms. The nomograms for both OS and CSS displayed that the AJCC N status contributed most to the survival outcomes, followed by T status and M status. Radiotherapy played an important role in the prognosis of OS and CSS. Each variable pointed to a score, and we could get a total score for an individual patient by summing up all scores. The predictive probabilities of OS and CSS at 3-year and 5-year were calculated by the total score according to the bottom scale. In general, the OS and CSS rates were better for patients with males, married status and tongue base. Patients with earlier AJCC T, N and N status survived better. Additionally, survival outcomes were superior for those receiving radiotherapy.
3.5. Validation of nomogram
Internal validation of the nomograms for OS and CSS were performed in the training sets. Similarly, external validation was performed in the validation sets. As Figure 4 showed, no matter in

the internal or external validation, all the calibration curves moved towards the standard curves. It displayed a good agreement between the predicted and actual values of 3-year and 5-year probabilities for OS and CSS. In detail, the C-index for the nomogram predicting OS was 0.713 (95% CI, 0.691-0.734) corrected as 0.705 during internal validation. While in external validation, the C-index predicting OS was 0.664 (95% CI, 0.630-0.700) corrected as 0.664.
Likewise, when it came to CSS, the C-index was 0.715 (95% CI, 0.691-0.738) corrected as 0.708 in internal validation. And in external validation, the C-index for CSS was 0.663 (95% CI, 0.662-0.702) corrected as 0.664. It demonstrated that the nomogram models were generally accurate after validation.

To compare the predictive ability of the established nomograms with that of T, N, M status, we also performed both internal and external validation of T, N, M status for OS and CSS, shown in Supplemental Table S2, http://links.lww.com/MD/ D63. Consequently, we found that all the C-indices as well as the corrected C-indices of T, N, M status were less than 0.650, which meant that it was not good for T, N, M status to predict survival prognosis.
4. Discussion
Tongue cancer has caused great harm all over the world. In 2017, there were 16,400 estimated new cases diagnosed with tongue cancer and 2400 estimated deaths caused by it in the United States.[19] For stage IV tongue cancer, surgery is necessary and a combination of radiotherapy is recommended for most patients. However, the current treatment strategies of stage IV advanced TSCC are decided mainly according to the AJCC TNM staging system, but the TNM staging system can not accurately predict the prognosis of advanced TSCC patients especially for those receiving surgical treatment. As rare studies developed clinical nomograms to predict survival of resected stage IV TSCC patients, here we constructed and validated nomogram models for these patients.
In this study, we took advantage of more than 1500 cases with stage IV TSCC after surgery from the SEER database. Then we selected the independent prognostic factors based on the Kaplan- Meier analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis to visually construct OS and CSS nomograms. Internal and external validation with bootstrap resampling and cross-validation method were performed, and we used calibration curves and C-indices to estimate the predictive accuracy of 3-year and 5-year probabilities for OS and CSS. Consequently, almost all the Cindices were nearly 0.700, and the calibration curves performed well, which verified the effectiveness of clinical nomograms of stage IV TSCC patients after surgery.
Nomograms have been extensively used in cancer patients, and exhibit more accuracies of prognosis than the conventional staging system. Adibi et al developed a nomogram to predict the individualized risk 3-year and 5-year lung metastasis-free survival for patients who underwent nephrectomy for localized advanced renal cell carcinoma.[20] In order to predict the survival of adenocarcinoma of the appendix, Xie et al even constructed superior derived nomogram stages compared with traditional AJCC TNM staging system.[21] When it came to TSCC patients, Li et al developed nomograms to estimate long-term overall survival and cancer-specific survival based on 12,674 patients, which provided more personalized and reliable prognostic information, and improved clinical decision-making.[22] Compared with early stage I/II TSCC patients, the clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies of advanced stage III/IV TSCC patients are more complex, and the corresponding prognosis is more difficult to predict. So we explored the application of nomogram models on the prediction of survival outcomes for resected stage IV TSCC patients.
Here, we found that some demographic and clinicopathological characteristics acted as independent prognostic factors for OS and CSS, which is in accordance with previous studies.[23] Advanced age and black race were found to be associated with poor survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and this effect persisted even after adjustment.[24] Another study emphasized the racial differences

in male patients with HNSCC, and found black patients have a
high incidence of aggressive and advanced HNSCC, leading to poorer survival in black.[25] In our studies focusing on stage IV
TSCC after surgery, the impact of these demographic variables on survival outcomes was still statistically significant. It has been demonstrated that marital status acts as an independent
prognostic factor in several cancers, such as breast cancer and gastric cancer.[26,27] Our previous study also found that married
patients had better OS and CSS compared to other unmarried groups in TSCC, and subgroup survival analysis confirmed it.[28] Our study also proved the important role of marriage in the
overall prognosis of resected stage IV TSCC. As for clinico-
pathological characteristics, both OS and CSS became worse
along with more advanced AJCC T status, N status and M status, which was consistent with other studies.[22,24,29] Surgery is an

essential routine treatment for advanced TSCC patients, and postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy should also be considered.[3] As for treatment, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors for prognosis of HNSCC including TSCC.[30,31] However, in our study, we found that only the radiotherapy improved OS and CSS outcomes, and radiotherapy had a great impact on prognosis even after subgroup adjustment.
Compared with the established nomograms in the previous study, our nomograms show more advantages.[22] In addition to the common demographic and clinicopathological factors, we also consider the variables of tumor site and chemotherapy. The tongue is mainly divided into 2 parts, the oral tongue and the base of tongue. These 2 parts have different embryological origins, and the resulting different tumor classifications, the oral cavity cancer

and oropharyngeal cancer. So the variable of tumor site should be taken into consideration. Besides surgery and radiotherapy, chemotherapy is another important prognostic factor for TSCC patients, which is just updated by the SEER database in recent years.[30] More importantly, we focus on the stage IV TSCC patients after surgery in this study. It is a particular group that shares diverse patterns from the early stage TSCC patients. Therefore, it is necessary for us to build specific nomograms for these patients.
The established nomograms are easily applicable to clinical practice because of visibility and utility. For 1 patient, each variable corresponds to a score, and the sum of all scores maps a linear predictor value, as well as the predictive 3-year and 5-year probabilities for OS and CSS. When we come across a new patient with resected advanced stage IV TSCC, we can predict his prognosis based on the demographic and clinicopathological information. For instance, the 62-year-old black patient was diagnosed with T3N1M0. The tumor located in other tongue sites and he was married. She received both surgery and radiotherapy. In line with our nomograms, the predicted 3-year and 5-year OS rates are 40% and 35% respectively, and 3-year and 5-year CSS rates are 35% and 30% respectively.
The nomograms in our study are significant for decisionmaking by patients. Modern medical models are increasingly

emphasizing the patient's role during the doctor-patient communication.[32] However, until now most clinical decisions are still led by doctors. Medical terms have become an invisible barrier between doctors and patients. Based on our study, the nomogram provides patients a visualizing tool to evaluate outcomes of different clinical decisions, which could improve clinical decision-making by patients. Furthermore, the variables utilized in our nomograms are easy to understand for patients in clinical practice. So, the application of nomograms helps optimize the patient-physician interaction and promote patient-centered care.
This is an analysis based on a large population of about 1550 patients with a follow-up period of about 10 years, which diminishes biases and increases the reliability of the results. However, there are several potential limitations. Firstly, the SEER database lacks critical information, such as detailed chemotherapy, comorbidities, and complications.[33] There are important missing variables, such as p16 status and tobacco exposure. These data may affect survival outcomes. Secondly, this is a retrospective study instead of a prospective study. It inevitably brings about selection bias. So, more cohort studies are required to further verify the results. Thirdly, there are small sample sizes of patients in some subgroups, such as 35 patients with AJCC N1 status and 11 patients with AJCC M1 status in the validation set. Fourthly, when we perform OS

analysis, death from other causes unrelated to cancer may differ among subgroups. It may affect the stability of the nomogram model for OS. Competing risk analysis is a better statistical method to reduce the impact of death from other causes, once all the death cause data are available from the SEER database.[34]

5. Conclusion In conclusion, we constructed and validated clinical nomogram models to predict OS and CSS in patients with stage IV TSCC after surgery based on the SEER database. It exhibited good accuracy and effectiveness to identify those with high risks of mortality. The nomogram models act as useful tools for clinicians

For the assessment of external doses due to contaminated environment, the dose-rate conversion factors (DCFs) prescribed in Federal Guidance Report 12 (FGR 12) and FGR 13 have been widely used. Recently, there were significant changes in dosimetric models and parameters, which include the use of the Reference Male and Female Phantoms and the revised tissue weighting factors, as well as the updated decay data of radionuclides. In this study, the DCFs for effective and equivalent doses were calculated for three exposure settings: skyshine, groundshine and water immersion. Doses to the Reference Phantoms were calculated by Monte Carlo simulations with the MCNPX 2.7.0 radiation transport code for 26 mono-energy photons between 0.01 and 10 MeV. The transport calculations were performed for the source volume within the cut-off distances practically contributing to the dose rates, which were determined by a simplified calculation model. For small tissues for which the reduction of variances are difficult, the equivalent dose ratios to a larger tissue (with lower statistical errors) nearby were employed to make the calculation efficient. Empirical response functions relating photon energies, and the organ equivalent doses or the effective doses were then derived by the use of cubic-spline fitting of the resulting doses for 26 energy points. The DCFs for all radionuclides considered important were evaluated by combining the photon emission data of the radionuclide and the empirical response functions. Finally, contributions of accompanied beta particles to the skin equivalent doses and the effective doses were calculated separately and added to the DCFs. For radionuclides considered in this study, the new DCFs for the three exposure settings were within +10 % when compared with DCFs in FGR 13.

INTRODUCTION
For the assessment of public and radiation worker's doses due to radionuclides released into the environment from nuclear facilities either during the normal operation or under accident situations, dose-rate conversion factors (DCFs), i.e. the organ equivalent DCFs or the effective DCFs due to a unit concentration of radionuclides in the environmental media, are needed for both external and internal exposure pathways. For external exposure pathways, those DCFs provided by United States Environmental Protection Agency in the Federal Guidance Report 12 (FGR 12)(1) and FGR 13(2) have been widely employed. Both of them provide DCFs for an individual standing either in contaminated air or on contaminated ground, or in contaminated water. The MIRD-type stylised phantom based on the Reference Man(3) was used to model the exposed individual.

Recently, there are significant changes in the dosimetric models, procedures and even in radionuclide decay data. First, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) developed new voxel phantoms(4) representing the Reference Male and the Reference Female for use in dosimetric calculations. The body sizes of adult Reference Phantoms are a little larger than those defined previously and the location and the size of each organ or tissue became much more realistic. Secondly, the ICRP modified the tissue weighting factors needed in the calculation of the effective dose in the 2007 recommendations(5). Thirdly, there are changes in the process of calculating the effective dose; sex averaging of organ equivalent doses before weighting the tissue weighting factors. Finally, the radiation decay data of radionuclides interested in radiological assessments also were updated and published in ICRP publication 107(6). All of these changes should affect the values of

DCFs. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of such recent changes on the DCFs.
In this study, the DCFs for external exposure with all those changes being taken into account were calculated. The environmental compositions and settings for external exposure are similar to those used in FGR 12.
Impact of recent changes may be more significant in the case of internal exposure because those changes in geometrical models of the Reference Phantoms directly and sensitively affect the S-values, the specific equivalent dose of radionuclides. Moreover, there are additional changes in the internal dosimetric models, e.g. the human alimentary tract model (ICRP 100, 2006)(7) replacing the simple ICRP 30 model(8).
However, only the DCFs for external exposure were calculated in this study. Tissue-equivalent DCFs and effective DCFs were calculated for three exposure settings, i.e. the skyshine doses from contaminated air, the groundshine doses from contaminated ground surface and the immersion doses from contaminated water.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Computational models and data
The computational models for the skyshine, groundshine and water immersion exposures are shown in Figures 1 and 2. The phantoms being exposed are the Reference Male or Female Phantoms prescribed in ICRP publication 110 (2009). For calculating the dose rates for the skyshine and groundshine models, the earth is modelled down to 4.0-m depth to take into account the albedo effect. For the groundshine model, it is assumed that the contaminants exist on the ground surface only. For these three models, radionuclides are assumed to distribute uniformly over the entire volume of air or water and over the entire area of ground surface.

The material composition data of air, soil and water are given in Table 1(1). For the phantoms, the material composition data of organs or tissues given in Tables B1 and B2 of ICRP publication 110 (2009)(3) were used.
Radionuclides having a potentially wide range in the environment as a result of planned or unplanned releases from nuclear facilities were considered in this study. Hence, they are largely fission products or activation products expected to be generated during the operation of nuclear facilities. The radiation production data of radionuclides were extracted from those given in ICRP publication 107. Since nuclides interested in this study do not include ones with the capacity for neutron production, and since alpha particles are not relevant to external exposure, gamma rays, X-rays and beta particles are selected as the sources emitted from the radionuclides.
The Monte Carlo particle transport code MCNPX is used together with the cross-section library MCNPLIB04(9) and El03(10) in the calculation of absorbed dose to the organs of Reference Phantoms due to unit source intensity of specified energies of photons. For the specified photon energies, 26 energy points are used for the range of 0.01- 10 MeV. Absorbed doses for organs and tissues have been calculated by applying F6 tally in the MCNPX code(11).
Simplifications and approximations for computation
Cut-off distances
Ideally, the source media are semi-infinite. However, it is evident that radiation particles produced

extremely far from the receptor phantoms do not contribute to the resulting dose, while they increase computation time and relative errors significantly. To avoid this inefficacy, appropriate cut-off distances (CODs) are employed for this computation.
In order to determine the CODs for photons having different energies, trial calculations were made with a simplified receptor model. As the simplified receptor, a tissue-equivalent sphere of 1 m in diameter centred at 1.5 m above the ground surface or deep in water was used. With repeated calculations by increasing the distance from 1 mean-free-path (MFP), the resulting absorbed doses were monitored to check
Table 1. Material compositions and densities of air, soil and water.

their convergences. An analysis indicating whether the resulting dose had been increased ,1 % for the additional distance of 1 MFP, was performed, and these final distances were then selected as the CODs.
The CODs were 2.5- 6 MFPs depending on the photon energies in the cases of skyshine and groundshine, and 7 MFPs in the case of water immersion, respectively. Figure 3 shows the resulting CODs (in meters) as a function of photon energy. Successive calculations with the Reference Phantoms were carried out up to these CODs.
As a test, the weighted equivalent doses using ICRP 110 Reference Male only were calculated at the CODs, and then compared with those calculated up to the CODsþ0.5 MFP at the same energy point. There were no significant differences in the resulting doses.

Equivalent dose ratio method
Some organs or tissues in the Reference Phantoms, e.g. the thymus and the lymph nodes, are very small and accordingly the statistical variances in the dose estimates remain large even with extremely large numbers of histories. The situation becomes worse when the source volume increases, because the geometrical efficiency decreases roughly with the inverse square of the distance from the source point to the receptor volume, particularly in the case of the air contamination setting.
To overcome this problem in the air contamination setting, scaling factors for such small organs were employed. This is the equivalent dose ratio method

(EDRM). For the other settings (groundshine and water immersion), the statistical errors were satisfactorily reduced by increasing the histories.
The EDRM is based on the inference that the energy spectrum of photons incident to the receptor body would not significantly change with the geometrical range beyond a few MFPs because the particle fluence at the receptor position is dominated by those produced for closer reference distances. Then, the ratios among different organ doses would tend to be invariant with the increasing source volume. This enables one to estimate the doses to small organs from the extended source volume by multiplying the dose to an organ with the larger volume (reference organ), where the statistical error is satisfactorily reduced, by the ratio values (K ) determined with a smaller source volume. The muscle is selected as the reference organ and the dose ratios Kij, where i is the index of organ of interest and j is the photon energy, were evaluated at 50 m radius. That is,

where ro is the reference distance (50 m) and RO denotes the reference organ (MUSCLE).
As a test case, Figure 4 shows the K factors of various organs calculated for 1250-keV photons at some different sizes of the source volume. It is confirmed that K factors deviate within 10 %, while the radius of the air volume varies from 50 m to the COD (565 m).

For validating K factors, the equivalent dose rates for r ¼ COD ½HiCOD can be calculated as

where ½H_ Ci OD is the equivalent dose to organ i at COD and ½H_ CROOD is the equivalent dose to the reference organ at the reference distance (50 m). And, K factors are applied for organs having the relative errors of 10 % or more resulted in MCNP simulations at each energy bin.
K factors for different organs at different photon energies are given in Appendix A.

Calculation of DCFs
Photon DCFs
For each exposure setting, the equivalent doses to all the organs/tissues contributing to the effective ones were calculated for both the Reference Male and Female Phantoms for the 26 fixed energy points. Then, sex-averaged organ equivalent doses were calculated by simple averaging of the organ equivalent doses of the Reference Male and Female. The effective doses were calculated by weighting and averaging the sex-averaged organ equivalent doses over all the organs for which the tissue weighting factors are given in ICRP 103. This procedure provides dose coefficients for photon sources having unit emission intensity at the fixed energy points.
In order to apply the dose coefficients (for equivalent doses and effective doses) to the source spectra

of radionuclides, they fit to mathematical functions of energy(12). Finally, the photon DCFs for all radionuclides were calculated by

X

ð3Þ

i

where yi is the yield of photon energy Ei per disintegration of the given radionuclide, DC is the dose coefficient calculated using the fitted equations and the subscript p indicates photon DCF.

Beta particle contribution
Beta particles emitted from the radionuclides having the maximum energies of a few MeV contribute to the equivalent doses to superficial tissues, typically the skin and the lens of eyes. Currently, no tissue weighting factor is assigned for the lens and consequently the skin equivalent doses only contribute to the effective doses. Since there are no changes in the calculation of electron dosimetry, the contribution of beta radiation to the DCFs can be determined by the conventional approach except for any changes in source emission data.
Therefore, the skin equivalent dose for beta particles are used data at table III.1, table III.2 and table III.3 in FGR 12 in this study.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Photon dose coefficients
Figures 5-7 show the calculated equivalent dose coefficients, which are compared with the FGR 12 values, of 1-MeV photon to selected organs for the three exposure settings. In spite of those changes in the Reference Phantoms and in the tissue weighting factors, the DCFs for the three cases do not deviate significantly from the values of FGR 12. Notable differences are in the dose equivalents to bone surface. Dose equivalents to bone surface in FGR 12 are significantly higher than those derived from this study. The differences can be attributed to the different dosimetric approaches applied. The mean dose to bone region was taken as the bone surface equivalent dose in FGR 12 because the bone surface region had not been modelled in the MIRD-type phantom. The Reference Phantoms of ICRP used in this study include the soft bone surface regions specifically defined. Typically, the bone density is higher than soft tissues, and contains high-Z elements resulting in the increased doses.
Figures 8-10 show the curves of effective dose coefficients fitted as the function of photon energies, and compared with FGR 12 values [effective dose equivalent (HE) and effective dose (E)](13) as well.
Exposure characteristics of photons having low energies are larger in the organs of breasts, salivary

glands and gonads (ovaries), which are located in the near positions from the surface of the human body, than the other organs due to their low penetrating capacities to the human body. The equivalent dose for the breasts applying new Reference Phantom have been especially turned out to be larger than one applying the existing reference phantom(4, 14). There are some increases to effective doses due to the increase in weighting factors, 0.05-0.12, as well. From these stated reviews, effective doses for energies ,30 keV have been confirmed to have than ones applying DCFs of FGR 12 and FGR 13.
The equivalent dose coefficients applied for evaluating organ equivalent doses are provided as Tables in Appendix B.
DCFs
The DCFs for each nuclide are obtained by summing each photon's equivalent DCF. The skin equivalent DCF is obtained by summing equivalent dose rates from the beta particles.
New DCFs calculated in this study were compared with those summarised in FGR 12 and FGR 13 and are shown in Appendix C. External exposure from the radioactive nuclides considered in this study as environmentally important is not changed significantly by applying new DCFs.
CONCLUSION
By considering the recent changes in the dosimetric models, procedures for determining the effective dose and even the decay data of radionuclides, new DCFs needed for estimating the radiological impact of radionuclides on the environment have been calculated for three external exposure settings: skyshine, groundshine and water immersion.
The new DCFs have been compared with those provided in FGR 12 and FGR 13. Most of the calculated DCFs are within +10 % of the values

suggested in FGR 12 and 13 except a few radionuclides due to their decay data, their contributions to organ doses and the characteristics of Reference Phantoms. Although the new DCFs do not significantly differ from the previous ones, it should be emphasised that the new DCFs are based on the current recommendations of the ICRP.
There are always underlying uncertainties in this type of dosimetric calculations. A standardising process, therefore, is needed to establish a reference set of DCFs by national authorities or an international body like the ICRP. The DCFs given in this study together with other result(15), will provide important input to the standardising process.

section followed by radiation and 5 cycles of pembrolizumab stable at 5th cycle. CONCLUSION:Children with NF1 stigmata and GBM can have concurrent NF1 and LS, or CMMRD with NF1 somatic mutations. Our patients tolerated alkylating agents, despite risk for secondary malignancies as upfront therapy and at recurrence checkpoint inhibitors. Upfront therapy in GBM with mismatch repair syndrome with checkpoint inhibitors should be studied.
NFB-07. USE OF PEGYLATED INTERFERON - 2B IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS AFFECTED BY UNRESECTABLE PLEXIFORM NEUROFIBROMAS: MONOCENTRIC EXPERIENCE Antonella Cacchione, Maria Chiara Lodi, Giada Del Baldo, Andrea Carai, Giovanna Stefania Colafati, Francesca Diomedi Camassei, Franco Locatelli, and Angela Mastronuzzi; Bambino Gesù Children Hospital, Rome, Italy
BACKGROUND:Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is autosomal dominant neurogenetic disorder characterized by progressive cutaneous, neurologic, skeletal, and neoplastic manifestations. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) are one of the different types of neurofibromas that occur in these patients. Complete surgical resection is difficult due to the tumor infiltrative behavior. We evaluated pegylated interferon- -2b (PI) in patients with unresectable progressive or symptomatic PN. METHODS: Pediatric patients (1-21 years old) affected by unresectable PN, followed at Bambino Gesù Hospital, were treated with PI. We administered PI as a weekly subcutaneous injection at a beginning dose of 1.0 mcg/kg/wk, increased to 3.0 mcg/kg/wk if well tolerated. Paracetamol (15mg/kg) was given 30 minutes prior the dose of PI and then every 4-6 hours as needed. Patients were evaluated with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) every 12 months after treatment start in case of stable disease. RESULTS: 10 patients (3 females, 7 males) were enrolled. Median age was 12 years old. The median duration of treatment was 12,6 months. Grade 3 neutropenia (30%) and increased liver transaminases level (20%) were the most common toxicity. 6/10 patients experienced an improvement about pain. 7/10 patients showed clinical response. 1/10 patient had a radiological response at MRI, 1/10 experienced progression disease and 8/10 showed a stable disease at MRI evaluation. CONCLUSIONS:Our study demonstrated that PI could be a suitable treatment for unresectable PN in terms of stabilization of the tumour size due to its antitumor activity although clinical response does not correlate with radiographic changes.

PHASE II STUDY OF AXITINIB IN PATIENTS WITH NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE 2 AND PROGRESSIVE VESTIBULAR SCHWANNOMAS Sheetal Phadnis1, Mari Hagiwara1, Anna Yaffe1, Carole Mitchell1, Theodore Nicolaides1, Srivandana Akshintala2, Tsivia Hochman1, Judith Goldberg1, Jeffrey Allen1, and Matthias Karajannis3; 1NYU Langone Hospital, New York, NY, USA, 2National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA, 3Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA
INTRODUCTION: Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and c-KIT represent clinically and/or preclinically validated molecular targets in vestibular schwannomas. We conducted a single institution, prospective, open-label, two-stage phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02129647) to estimate the response rate to axitinib, an oral multi-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR, PDGFR and c-KIT, in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) patients with progressive vestibular schwannomas (VS). METHODS:NF2 patients older than 5 years with at least one volumetrically measurable, progressive VS were eligible. The primary endpoint was to estimate the objective volumetric response rates to axitinib. Axitinib was given continuously in 28-day cycles for up to of 12 cycles. Response was assessed every 3 months with MRI using 3-D volumetric tumor analysis and audiograms. Volumetric response and progression were defined as 20% decrease or increase in VS volume, respectively. RESULTS: Twelve eligible patients (ages: 14-56 years) were enrolled on this study. Seven of twelve patients completed 12 cycles (range: 2 to 12 cycles). We observed two imaging and three hearing responses. Best volumetric response was -53.9% after nine months on axitinib. All patients experienced drug-related toxicities, the most common adverse events were diarrhea, hematuria and skin toxicity, not exceeding grade 2 and hypertension, not exceeding grade 3. CONCLUSIONS: While axitinib has modest anti-tumor activity in NF2 patients, it is more toxic and appears to be less effective compared to bevacizumab. Based on these findings, further clinical development of axitinib for this indication does not appear warranted.

INTRODUCTION:Because treatment and clinical management decisions for children with NF1-OPG remain challenging, we sought to establish evidence-based guidelines. We prospectively enrolled children with newlydiagnosed NF1-OPGs, and gathered standardized clinical neuro-oncology and ophthalmology assessments. METHODS: Only children with NF1 and newly diagnosed OPGs, confirmed by central review, were eligible. Indications for obtaining the initial MRI, as well as factors associated with the decision to treat with chemotherapy or observe without treatment, were obtained. Quantitative visual acuity (VA), other ophthalmic features, and imaging were captured at standard time points. Goal enrollment is 250 subjects. RESULTS: One-hundred thirty-three children (52% female) from 20 institutions met inclusion criteria, and were included in this preliminary analysis. Eighty-six percent of subjects were able to perform quantitative VA testing at enrollment. The most common reasons for the diagnostic MRI included screening related to NF1 diagnosis (36.8%), ophthalmologic concerns (29.3%), and non-ophthalmologic concerns (24.8%), such as headache. To date, twenty subjects have initiated treatment with chemotherapy, twelve (9%) at the time of the initial OPG diagnosis. Median age at OPG diagnosis was 3.1 years. Age and sex distribution were similar in subjects immediately entering the observation and treatment arms (median age 3.0 versus 3.5 years, respectively). CONCLUSION:Most children with NF1-OPGs are observed at time of their initial OPG diagnosis, rather than treated. Importantly, a large proportion of children are able to complete quantitative VA testing at enrollment. Once enrollment is complete, these data will help to establish evidence-based guidelines for clinical management of NF1-OPGs.
NFB-11. WHITE MATTER DIFFERENCES IN CHILDREN WITH NF1 COMPARED TO CONTROLS Lisa Bruckert, Katie Travis, Emily McKenna, Kristen Yeom, and Cynthia Campen; Stanford, Palo Alto, CA, USA
INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic condition in which children develop learning challenges and glioma. White matter tracts (WMT) are implicated in these cognitive functions, while oligodendroglial precursor cells are implicated in both gliomagenesis and whitematter development. Specific WMTs have not been well characterized in NF1. METHODS: Twenty NF1 patients aged 1.4-17.6 years (M = 9.5 years, 24 male) and 20 age-and-sex-matched controls underwent dMRI at 3T (25 directions, b=1000 s/mm2). Automated segmentation of WMTs extracted fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of 18 major WMTs. Covariance analysis examined the effect of group (NF1/controls) on FA/MD after controlling for intracranial volume. Regression analyses for WMTs determined the interaction of FA/MD with age for NF1 patients compared to controls. Significance was set at p<0.05 after correcting for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate. RESULTS: Compared to controls, children with NF1 had significantly decreased FA in 8 and increased MD in 12/18 tracts. Differences held after controlling for intracranial volume. The interaction between group and age accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in FA in 9 and in MD in 16/18 tracts. FA and MD differ-

Objectives: Our aim was to investigate the associations between dietary GI, CF and CQI and new-onset T2DM risk among Chinese adult.
Methods: Dietary glycemic index (GI), carbohydrate to fiber ratio (CF) and carbohydrate quality index (CQI) are conventional and emerging indicators for carbohydrate quality, respectively. Their associations with new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk in Chinese adults remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the associations between dietary GI, CF and CQI and new-onset T2DM risk among Chinese adults. This prospective cohort study included 14,440 adults from the China Health and Nutrition Survey without cardiometabolic diseases at baseline. The associations between dietary GI, CF and CQI and T2DM risk were assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis and dose-response relationships were explored using restricted cubic spline and threshold analyses.

Results: After a median follow-up duration of 9 years, a total of 1061 incident T2DM cases were identified. In fully adjusted models, higher dietary GI values were associated with reduced risk of T2DM, especially for Q4 (Q4 vs Q1: HR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.70; P-trend = 0.013), while CF and CQI were not significantly associated with incident T2DM. There were significant effect modifications of the association between dietary GI and T2DM risk by region and amount of carbohydrate intake (both P-interaction < 0.050). RCS analyses demonstrated significant non-linear trends of the associations between dietary GI and CF and T2DM risk (both P-overall < 0.001, P-nonlinear = 0.001), and threshold analyses showed that T2DM risk decreased and reached the bottom when dietary GI was 74.5 (73.4, 75.6) and CF was 27.3 (25.1, 29.6) (both P-log likelihood ratio < 0.001).
Conclusions: There were U-shaped relationships between dietary GI and CF and T2DM risk, indicating both dietary GI and CF should be controlled in a moderate range for T2DM prevention in Chinese adults. Further studies are required to confirm whether these indicators should be incorporated into dietary guidelines and Nutrient Facts panel labeling intended to help reduce T2DM risk in Chinese population.

Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Yes1 associated transcriptional regulator (YAP1) in the pathology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its potential as a therapeutic target. Methods: YAP1 expression in HCC and adjacent tissues was determined via immunohisto­ chemistry; in HCC and human normal liver cell lines, expression was examined via Western blotting. The effects of YAP1 knockdown and overexpression were detected following trans­ fection of HCC cells with siRNA-YAP1 recombinants or pcDNA3.1-YAP1 plasmids. A tumor xenograft model was constructed by implanting YAP1-knockdown lentivirus-infected Hep-3B cells into nude mice, and the animals were treated with sorafenib. Results: In patients with HCC, YAP1 was upregulated in tumor tissue compared with adjacent tissue, and its high expression in the tumor was associated with increased Edmonson grade. In vitro, YAP1 expression was increased in Hep-3B, SK-HEP-1 and Huh7 cells, while it was similar in SMMC-7721 cells and LO2 cells. Meanwhile, YAP1 increased cell proliferation and invasion, promoted the progression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and inhibited cell apoptosis in HCC cells; furthermore, YAP1 knockdown combined with the administration of sorafenib decreased cell viability and increased cell apoptosis compared with YAP1 knock­ down or treatment with sorafenib alone. In vivo, YAP1 knockdown inhibited tumor growth and metastasis, whereas it promoted apoptosis; meanwhile, YAP1 knockdown synergized with sorafenib to suppress tumor progression in HCC mice. Conclusion: YAP1 is upregulated in both HCC tumor tissues and cell lines. Moreover, it promotes cell proliferation and invasion and promoted the progression of epithelial- mesenchymal transition in vitro. Furthermore, targeting YAP1 inhibits HCC progression and improves sensitivity to sorafenib in vitro and in vivo. Keywords: Yes1 associated transcriptional regulator, hepatocellular carcinoma, sorafenib, proliferation, invasion, apoptosis

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the fifth most prevalent type of tumors and the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality globally; its inci­ dence presents a progressive increment with age in all populations.1,2 The potential curative treatments include liver resection, orthotopic liver transplantation, radio­ frequency ablation, and microwave ablation, while palliative treatment options

include intra-arterial administration of chemotherapy, embolizing material, and radioactive particles. These treat­ ment modalities have improved the clinical outcomes of a small portion of patients with HCC; however, the major­ ity of patients continue to be associated with an unfavor­ able prognosis owing to the high rate of tumor recurrence and increasing drug resistance.3-5 Thus, knowledge on the molecular biology of HCC is essential for the selection of the most appropriate treatment and improvement of the clinical outcomes in HCC management.
Yes1 associated transcriptional regulator (YAP1) is an important regulator of the Hippo pathway, which is an essential tumor-regulating signaling pathway in various malignancies.6,7 Recent studies indicated that YAP1 is a candidate oncogene and is associated with tumorigenesis via diverse biological processes, including the promotion of malignant phenotypes, regulation of epithelial- mesenchymal transition (EMT), and expansion of cancer stem cells.8,9 For example, in breast cancer, YAP1 pro­ motes tumor invasiveness by regulating the phosphoryla­ tion of focal adhesion kinase. Its knockdown sensitizes tumor cells to radiation by inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/PI3K/AKT signaling axis and increasing DNA damage.9,10 In another study, YAP1 was upregulated in gastric cancer tissues compared with noncancerous paired normal tissues, while its knockdown attenuated the proliferation of cancer cells and enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin by targeting the EGFR.11 According to the previous studies, we hypothesized that YAP1 may be implicated in the development and progression of HCC, and may serve as a target in the treatment of HCC, in combination with other drugs; however, the currently available evidence is insufficient. Therefore, in the present study, we explored the association of YAP1 with clinico­ pathological features of patients with HCC, and further investigated its role in regulating cell proliferation, apop­ tosis, invasion, and expression of its downstream gene (Tead) and EMT markers in vitro, as well as the synergis­ tic effect of YAP1 knockdown with sorafenib in vivo in this setting.
Materials and Methods Specimens and Cell Lines
Seventy HCC biopsy specimens and 20 paired adjacent tissue specimens were purchased from Shanghai Outdo Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The usage of these specimens was approved by the Institutional Review

Board of the company, and informed consent was provided by the patients prior to specimen collection. The human HCC cell lines Hep-3B, SMMC-7721, SK-HEP-1, and Huh-7, as well as the human normal liver cell line LO2, were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 g/mL of streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained in a humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. Following cell culture, the expression of YAP1 protein in the cell lines was determined by Western blotting.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Assay
HCC specimens and adjacent tissue specimens were cut into 4-µm paraffin-embedded sections, mounted on slides, deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with graded ethanol, and blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Heatinduced antigen retrieval was performed using a steamer at 95°C. The primary antibody Rabbit Anti-YAP1 antibody (Abcam, MA, USA) was diluted at a ratio of 1:50. Incubation was performed at 4°C overnight, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L (horseradish peroxidase [HRP]) (Abcam) in 1:50,000 dilution at 37°C for 60 min. Diaminobenzidine was subsequently applied for 10 min. Finally, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, cov­ ered, and visualized. According to previous studies,12,13 the expression of YAP1 was determined by the density of positive cells and the intensity of staining. The density was scored based on the proportion of positive cells (0: none; 1: 10%; 2: 11-25%; 3: 26-50%; 4: >50%), and the intensity was scored based on the average staining inten­ sity of positive cells (0: none; 1: weak; 2: intermediate; 3: strong). The final score was the product of the density score and intensity score, ranging 0-12. Patients were classified into two groups: YAP1 low expression (score: 0-3) and YAP1 high expression (score: 4-12).
Transfection
Three small-interfering RNAs (siRNA) against YAP1 (siRNA-YAP1) and non-targeting siRNA (siRNA-NC) were designed and synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai, China). A pcDNA3.1-YAP1 plasmid and the control plasmid (pcDNA3.1-NC) were also synthesized by GenePharma. Using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to the instructions provided by the

manufacturer, Hep-3B cells were transfected with siRNAYAP1 recombinants or siRNA-NC, as well as with the pcDNA3.1-YAP1 plasmid or pcDNA3.1-NC plasmid. The SMMC-7721 cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1-YAP1 plasmid or pcDNA3.1-NC plasmid. The non-transfected Hep-3B cells and SMMC-7721 cells served as controls check (CK). The expression of YAP1 protein in the cells was determined by Western blotting after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h of incubation.
Western Blotting Assay
Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA). After electrophoresis on a 12% or 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Subsequently, the membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk and incu­ bated overnight at 4°C with the following primary anti­ bodies: Rabbit Anti-YAP1 antibody (1:5000 dilution; Abcam), Rabbit Anti-YAP1 (phosphorylated S127) (pYAP1) antibody (1:50000 dilution; Abcam), Rabbit Anti-Ki67 antibody (1:5,000 dilution; Abcam), Rabbit Anti-TEAD-1 antibody (1:50000 dilution; Abcam), Rabbit Anti-E-cadherin antibody (1:50000 dilution; Abcam), Rabbit Anti-N-cadherin antibody (1:1000 dilu­ tion, Abcam), and Rabbit Anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phos­ phate dehydrogenase (Anti-GAPDH) antibody (1:10000 dilution, Abcam). The HRP-conjugated secondary anti­ body Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L (HRP) (1:20000 dilu­ tion, Abcam, USA) was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Signals were visualized after chemi­ luminescence reaction with horseradish peroxidase sub­ strate. The relative protein expressions of YAP1, pYAP1, Ki67, Tead, EMT markers (E-Cadherin and N-Cadherin) in different cells were normalized to the GAPDH concen­ tration, and the quantitative analysis was performed using the Image J software (National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA).
Cell Proliferation, Apoptosis, and Invasion Assays
Cell proliferation was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 cell viability assay kit (Dojindo, Kyushu Japan). In brief, 5,000 cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates. At 0 h, 24 h, 48 h or 72 h after incubation, 10 L of cell viability assay kit solution was added to each well. Subsequently, the absorbance of each well was measured

at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Biotek, VT, USA). Cell apoptosis was assessed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) using flow cytometry. Briefly, fol­ lowing transfection for 48 h, the cells were collected and stained in 500 L of a solution containing Annexin V-FITC in the dark. Then, PI was added for 5 min in the dark. Flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA) was used to detect the fluorescent signal in the cells. Cell invasion ability was assessed at 48 h after transfection through the Transwell assay using invasion chambers (BD Biosciences, CA, USA), as previously described.14 The invading cells that adhered to the lower surface of the membrane were viewed through an optical microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and counted by the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).
Lentivirus Infection and Assessment of Drug-Sensitivity
The YAP1-knockdown lentivirus (YAP1-KD-LV) and negative control lentivirus (NC-LV) were synthesized by GenePharma and used to infect Hep-3B cells. The cells infected with the YAP1-knockdown lentivirus were defined as YAP1-KD-LV cells; those infected with nega­ tive control lentivirus were defined as control cells; cells treated with 30 mg/kg sorafenib were defined as sorafenib cells; and those infected with YAP1-knockdown lentivirus and treated with sorafenib were defined as sorafenib and YAP1-KD-LV cells. As shown before, cell viability was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 cell viability assay kit (Dojindo) and cell apoptosis was assessed by FITC-labeled annexin-V and PI (Sigma-Aldrich) using flow cytometry.
Construction of a Tumor Xenograft Model
The animal study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Hangzhou, China), following the Guidelines for the ethi­ cal review of laboratory animal welfare People's Republic of China National Standard GB/T35892-2018.15 Twenty BALB/c male nude mice (4-5 weeks old, 18-20 g) were purchased from Shanghai Lab. Animal Research Center (Shanghai, China) and housed in a standard animal labora­ tory with free access to food and water. Subsequently, stably infected Hep-3B cells were screened out using

puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich). After the harvest, stably infected Hep-3B cells were suspended in serum-free DMEM (3×106/mL). Subsequently, the YAP1-KD-LV infected Hep-3B cells or NC-LV infected Hep-3B cells were injected into the upper flank region of nude mice (200 L per animal) for construction of the tumor xeno­ graft model. After 7 days, the mice were assigned into four groups (five mice per group) and treated as follows: (1) Control group: mice (implanted with NC-LV-infected Hep3B cells) were treated with saline solution by oral gavage once daily for 30 days; (2) Sorafenib group: mice (implanted with NC-LV-infected Hep-3B cells) were trea­ ted with 30 mg/kg sorafenib (diluted in saline solution) by oral gavage once daily for 30 days; (3) YAP1-KD-LV group: mice (implanted with YAP1-KD-LV-infected Hep3B cells) were treated with saline solution by oral gavage once daily for 30 days; and (4) Sorafenib & YAP1-KD-LV group: mice (implanted with YAP1-KD-LV-infected Hep3B cells) were treated with 30 mg/kg sorafenib (diluted in saline solution) by oral gavage once daily for 30 days. After 30 days of treatment, all mice were sacrificed with pentobarbital, and the tumors were resected and weighed. Furthermore, tumor specimens were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. The cell apoptosis in the tumor speci­ mens was detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl trans­ ferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay using the TumorTACS in situ Apoptosis Detection kit (R&D, MN, USA) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The expression of YAP1, matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3), and MMP9 in the specimens was assessed by IHC assay. The primary antibodies (all purchased from Abcam) were: Rabbit Anti-YAP1 antibody (1:5,000 dilution); Rabbit Anti-MMP3 antibody (1:50 dilution); and Rabbit Anti-MMP9 antibody (1:1,000 dilu­ tion). The secondary antibody (also purchased from Abcam) was Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L (HRP) (1:20,000 dilution).
Statistical Analysis
Data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation or number (percentage). In the clinical data analyses, the com­ parison of YAP1 expression between tumor tissue and adja­ cent tissue was determined using the McNemar test. The comparison of clinicopathological features between patients with low and high expression of YAP1 was conducted using the chi-squared test. In the experiment-related analyses, the comparison among groups was determined through one-way analysis of variance, followed by Dunnett's multiple

comparisons test. Moreover, the comparison between two groups was performed using the unpaired t-test. Furthermore, the degree of drug interaction was calculated via calculation of the combination index (CI) according to previous evidence: CI<1 indicated a synergistic effect of drugs; CI=1 indicated an additive effect; and CI>1 indicated antagonism.16 All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.01 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) and SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) soft­ ware. P < 0.05 was considered significant, and the P value was displayed as *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and NS (P > 0.05) in the figures related to the experiments.
Results YAP1 Expression in HCC Tumor Tissue and Adjacent Tissue
Representative images of YAP1 low expression in adjacent tissue and YAP1 high expression in tumor tissue were exhibited (Figure 1A). The comparison of the percentage of YAP1 low/high expression between tumor tissue and adjacent tissue indicated that YAP1 was upregulated in HCC tumor tissue compared with adjacent tissue (P <0.001) (Figure 1B).
Correlation of Tumor YAP1 Expression in Tumors with Clinicopathological Features in Patients with HCC
High expression of YAP1 in tumors was associated with increased Edmonson grade (P =0.023), however, there was no correlation of tumor YAP1 expression in tumors with age (P =0.940), sex (P =0.289), tumor size (P =0.638), TNM stage (P =0.717), vascular invasion (P =0.289), adjacent organ invasion (P =0.709), or number of tumor nodules (P =0.518) (Table 1). Detailed information on the clinicopathological features of patients with HCC is provided in Table 1.
YAP1 and pYAP1 Expression in HCC Cell Lines and Normal Cells
YAP1 expression was higher in Hep-3B (P<0.001), SKHEP-1 (P<0.01), and Huh7 (P<0.01) cells, but exhibited a similar trend in SMMC-7721 (P>0.05) cells compared with LO2 cells (Figure 2A and B). pYAP1 expression was lower in Hep-3B (P<0.001), SK-HEP-1 (P<0.001), and Huh7 cells (P<0.01), but presented a similar trend in SMMC-7721 cells (P>0.05) compared with LO2 cells.

Hep-3B and SMMC-7721 cells were selected for the fol­ lowing cellular experiments.
YAP1 and pYAP1 Expressions After Transfection of Hep-3B and SMMC-7721 Cells
Hep-3B cells were transfected with three types of siRNAYAP1 recombinants and siRNA-NC. The expression of YAP1 in cells transfected with siRNA-YAP1 recombinants was decreased compared with that noted in cells trans­ fected with siRNA-NC at 48 h (P<0.001) and 72 h (P<0.001) (Figure 3A and B). Considering the greatest effect of the third siRNA-YAP1 recombinant in suppres­ sing YAP1, it was selected for the following cellular function experiments. SMMC-7721 cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1-YAP1 plasmid or pcDNA3.1-NC plas­ mid. YAP1 expression in cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1-YAP1 plasmid was increased compared with

that recorded in cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1-NC plasmid at 24 h (P<0.001), 48 h (P<0.01), and 72 h (P<0.01) (Figure 3C and D). These data indicated the successful transfection.
Effect of YAP1 Knockdown and Overexpression on the Proliferation of HCC Cells
In Hep-3B cells, proliferation in cells transfected with siRNAYAP1 recombinants was decreased compared with that observed in cells transfected with siRNA-NC at 48 h (P<0.05) and 72 h (P<0.05) (Figure 4A); furthermore, Ki67 protein expression was decreased in siRNA-YAP1 recombinants transfected cells compared with siRNA-NC transfected cells (P <0.05) (Figure 4B and C). In SMMC7721 cells, proliferation in cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1-YAP1 plasmid was increased compared with that detected in cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1-NC plasmid at

Effect of YAP1 Knockdown and Overexpression on Apoptosis in HCC Cells
In Hep-3B cells, the cell apoptosis rate in cells transfected with the siRNA-YAP1 recombinants was increased versus that observed in cells transfected with siRNA-NC (P<0.001) (Figure 5A and B). In SMMC-7721 cells, the cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1-YAP1 plasmid exhibited a declining trend in cell apoptosis rate versus those trans­ fected with the pcDNA3.1-NC plasmid, though the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05) (Figure 5C and D).

compared with that recorded in cells transfected with siRNANC (P <0.01) (Figure 6A and B). In SMMC-7721 cells, the number of invasive cells was increased in cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1-YAP1 plasmid compared with that deter­ mined in cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1-NC plasmid (P<0.001) (Figure 6C and D).
Effect of YAP1 Knockdown and Overexpression on the Expression of Tead and EMT Markers in HCC Cells
In Hep-3B cells, the expression of Tead (P<0.05) and N-cadherin (P <0.05) was decreased, whereas that of E-cadherin (P <0.05) was increased in cells transfected with siRNA-YAP1 recombinants versus cells transfected with siRNA-NC (Figure 7A and B). In SMMC-7721 cells, the expression of Tead (P<0.01) and N-cadherin (P<0.01) was higher, whereas that of E-cadherin (P<0.05) was lower in cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1-YAP1 plasmid versus those transfected with the pcDNA3.1-NC plasmid (Figure 7C and D).
Validation of the Effect of YAP1 Overexpression on the Proliferation, Apoptosis, and Invasion of Hep-3B Cells
Transfection of Hep-3B cells with the pcDNA3.1-YAP1 plasmid or pcDNA3.1-NC plasmid

led to an increase in YAP1 protein expression in the former group of cells (P<0.001) (Figure 8A and B). In Hep-3B cells, cell proliferation (optical density 450 nm absorbance) was higher at 48 h and 72 h (both P<0.05) (Figure 8C); Ki67 protein expression was higher (P<0.01) (Figure 8D and E), cell apoptosis rate was lower (P <0.05) (Figure 8F and G), and the number of invasive cells was elevated (P<0.05) (Figure 8H and I) in cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1-YAP1 plasmid versus those transfected with the pcDNA3.1-NC plas­ mid. These data verified that YAP1 promoted the pro­ liferation and invasion, whereas it inhibited apoptosis of HCC cells.
Validation of the Effect of YAP1 Overexpression on Tead and EMT Markers in Hep-3B Cells
In Hep-3B cells, the expression of Tead (P<0.01) and N-cadherin (P<0.01) was increased, whereas that of E-cadherin (P<0.01) was decreased in cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1-YAP1 plasmid versus cells trans­ fected with the pcDNA3.1-NC plasmid (Figure 9A and B). These data supported that YAP1 increased the expression of Tead and promoted EMT progression in HCC cells.

synergism. Moreover, the cell apoptosis rate in sorafenib cells (P<0.01) and YAP1-KD-LV cells (P<0.001) was increased versus that recorded in control cells. This rate was further enhanced in Sorafenib&YAP1-KD-LV cells compared with sorafenib cells (P<0.001) and YAP1-KDLV cells (P<0.01) (Figure 10B and C).
YAP1 Knockdown and Its Synergistic Effect with Sorafenib in Treating HCC Mice
A tumor xenograft model was constructed by injecting Hep-3B cells infected with YAP1-KD-LV or NC-LV into nude mice. Tumor size in the Sorafenib&YAP1-KD-LV group was smaller compared with those noted in the YAP1-KD-LV and Sorafenib groups. Moreover, it was smaller in the YAP1-KD-LV group compared with the Control group, and similar between the Sorafenib and Control groups (Figure 11A). In addition, the tumor weight was reduced in the Sorafenib & YAP1-KD-LV group compared with the YAP1-KD-LV (P<0.001) and Sorafenib groups (P<0.001). It was also decreased in the YAP1-KD-LV group versus the Control group (P<0.05),

and was similar between the Sorafenib and Control groups (P >0.05) (Figure 11B). Moreover, a CI value of 0.6801 ±0.2139 was obtained for the synergistic effect of YAP1 knockdown and sorafenib, suggesting synergism. Furthermore, the TUNEL assay indicated that the rate of tumor apoptosis in the Sorafenib & YAP1-KD-LV group was increased compared with those recorded for the YAP1-KD-LV and Sorafenib groups; this rate was also elevated in the YAP1-KD-LV and Sorafenib groups versus the Control group (Figure 11C). In addition, the IHC assay indicated that YAP1-KD-LV decreased the expression of YAP1, MMP3, and MMP9; the combination of YAP1-KDLV and sorafenib further reduced the expression of YAP1, MMP3, and MMP9 (Figure 11C).
Discussion
In the present study, we noted the following. Firstly, YAP1 was upregulated in HCC tumor tissues compared with adjacent tissues, and its high expression in tumors was associated with increased Edmonson grade in patients with HCC. Secondly, in vitro, YAP1 expression was increased, whereas that of pYAP1 was decreased, in HCC cell lines (Hep-3B, SK-HEP-1 and Huh7 cell lines)

compared with those detected in human normal liver cell line (LO2 cell line). YAP1 promoted cell proliferation, invasion, EMT progression, and the expression of its downstream gene Tead, but decreased cell apoptosis in HCC cells. Thirdly, in vivo, YAP1 knockdown exerted an inhibitory effect on tumor growth and metastasis, and demonstrated a synergistic anti-tumor effect with sorafenib in treating mice with HCC, which was verified by cellular experiments.
YAP1, as a member of the YAP family, is a transcriptional coactivator which regulates tissue home­ ostasis and organ development by triggering numerous cell-autonomous responses, such as sustained prolifera­ tion, therapy resistance, cell plasticity, and metastasis.17 Accumulating published evidence exhibit the essential role of YAP1 as an oncogene in the initiation and progression of tumors via various ways.6,11,18 For example, a study indicated that YAP1 is upregulated in gastric cancer tissues compared with normal mucosal tissues, and its overexpres­ sion increases cell proliferation but decreases apoptosis.18 In another study, YAP1 expression was elevated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and its knockdown represses the proliferation ability and

promotes apoptosis rate of bladder cancer cells.19 Clinically, high expression of YAP1 is associated with unfavorable tumor features in patients with various tumors, including gastric, non-small cell lung, colon, and breast cancer.20-23 A study indicated that YAP1 is posi­ tively correlated with clinical stage, tumor size, and lymph node metastasis in patients with gastric cancer.20 Another study exhibited that high expression of YAP1 is correlated with poor differentiation, increased depth of invasion, and lymph node metastasis in patients with colon cancer.22 According to these previous findings, it was hypothesized that YAP1 may be correlated with clinicopathological fea­ tures of patients with HCC. Confirming our hypothesis, we found that YAP1 was upregulated in HCC tumor tissues versus adjacent tissues, and high expression of YAP1 in tumors was associated with increased Edmonson grade in patients with HCC. The following possible reasons are considered. Firstly, according to the previous study, over­ expression of YAP1 was positively related to the expres­ sion of the EMT transcriptional factors (eg, ZEB1), and the activation of EMT was involved in the HCC formation, during which inducing tumor-initiating epithelial cells undergo EMT to generate HCC.6 Therefore, YAP1 was

Comparison of Tead, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin expression between Hep-3B cells transfected with siRNA-YAP1 and those transfected with siRNA-NC (A and B), and between SMMC-7721 cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1-YAP1 plasmid and those transfected with the pcDNA3.1-NC plasmid (C and D).

upregulated in HCC tissues compared with adjacent tis­ sues. Secondly, high expression of YAP1 was associated with increased stemness and EMT features, and the former may inhibit differentiation during tumor initiation and progression. Therefore, high expression of YAP1 was associated with poor tumor differentiation (increased Edmonson grade) in patients with HCC.6,24
Subsequently, we determined the expression of YAP1 in human HCC cell lines (Hep-3B, SMMC-7721, SK-HEP -1, and Huh-7) and a human normal liver cell line (LO2) through Western blotting. We found that YAP1 was upre­ gulated in Hep-3B, SK-HEP-1, Huh-7 cell lines compared with LO2 cell line. We observed that YAP1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, whereas it promoted cell apoptosis in Hep-3B cells. In SMMC-7721 cells, over­ expression of YAP1 promoted cell proliferation and inva­ sion; however, the apoptosis rate presented a decreasing trend without statistical significance. This observation may be due to unobvious effect of YAP1 on cell apoptosis and relatively low apoptosis rate in SMMC-7721 cells. This hypothesis warrants further investigation. We also con­ ducted cellular experiments to investigate the effect of

YAP1 overexpression on cell apoptosis in Hep-3B cells. The results indicated that overexpression of YAP1 inhib­ ited cell apoptosis. These data suggest that YAP1 pro­ moted the proliferation and invasion, whereas it inhibited the apoptosis of HCC cells. The results are consistent with those of a previous study reporting that silencing of YAP1 inhibited cell proliferation and invasion, but promoted apoptosis in thyroid cancer cells.25 In addition, we also found that YAP1 enhanced the expression of its down­ stream gene (Tead) in the Hippo signaling pathway in HCC cells, suggesting implication of this pathway in the pathology of the disease. However, this requires further exploration. Possible reasons are discussed below. Firstly, the Hippo signaling pathway is a tumor inhibitory signal­ ing pathway, which medicates cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration. Hence, YAP1 may promote cell proliferation, invasion, migration, but inhibit apoptosis by acting with TEADs (which was verified in our present study) and inactivating Hippo signaling, which further leads to tumor growth and metastasis.6 Secondly, existing evidence indicates that EMT is a vital biological process involved in cancer invasion and metastasis, and prior data

demonstrated that YAP1 enhanced the expression of N-cadherin but decreased that of E-cadherin, further resulting to the increased invasion of HCC cells,26-28 These findings were verified in the current study. Thirdly, according to a previous study, activation of the tumor

suppressor Hippo pathway led to cytoplasmic retention and further degradation of YAP1, while inactivation of the Hippo pathway contributed to the localization of YAP1 in the nucleus of HCC cells, as previously documented.29,30 Additionally, nuclear localization and

stabilization of YAP1 were correlated with increased HCC cell proliferation.31,32 Therefore, we hypothesized that YAP1 promoted cell proliferation and invasion, but inhib­ ited cell apoptosis via nuclear localization and cytoplasmic degradation of YAP1. However, due to the limited budget, we could not cover the expense of additional cellular study to investigate the subcellular localization of YAP1 and related activity in HCC cells. This will be the focus of our future study.
Existing research studies demonstrated the association of YAP1 with the occurrence of intrinsic or acquired drug

resistance in several types of tumors. In addition, accu­ mulating data reveal that knockdown of YAP1 synergis­ tically increases the efficacy of anti-tumor therapies, including molecular-targeted therapy, cytotoxic che­ motherapy, and radiotherapy.6,11,33 For example, knock­ down of YAP1 diminishes the resistance of HER2amplified breast cancer cells to lapatinib, and silencing of YAP1 in vivo attenuates the growth of implanted HER2-amplified tumors.34 In another study, overexpres­ sion of YAP1 increased the resistance of non-small cell lung cancer cells to erlotinib, and the combination of

YAP1 inhibitor and erlotinib suppressed the tumorigenic properties of these cells.35 Furthermore, sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor which possesses various antipro­ liferative, antiangiogenic, and proapoptotic properties, and is an effective first-line drug for the treatment of advanced HCC.36 According to the aforementioned evi­ dence, we hypothesized that knockdown of YAP1 may synergize with sorafenib in the treatment of HCC; there­ fore, we performed the corresponding in vitro and in vivo experiments. We found that knockdown of YAP1 decrease HCC tumor growth. Of note, combined YAP1 knockdown and administration of sorafenib had some synergistic benefit on inhibiting tumor growth, which was also supported by the results of the cellular experi­ ments. Furthermore, we performed the TUNEL assay and IHC assay. The results showed that the combination of YAP1 knockdown and sorafenib exerted a stronger effect on promoting apoptosis and inhibiting metastasis com­ pared with YAP1 knockdown or treatment with sorafenib alone in HCC. These findings suggested that YAP1 knockdown synergized with sorafenib in the treatment of HCC. The possible reasons are presented below. Firstly, according to the previous studies, YAP1 is asso­ ciated with the HCC stem cell phenotype, and its knock­ down weakened the HCC stem cell properties. Hence, knockdown of YAP1 may have an inhibitory effect on tumor progression and synergize with sorafenib by sup­ pressing stemness markers.37 Secondly, according to pre­ vious evidence, sorafenib served as an inhibitor of EGFR, and inactivation of EGFR signaling could suppress HCC cell growth via an YAP1-independent manner. Therefore, the combination of YAP1 knockdown and administration of sorafenib could exert a stronger inhibitory effect on tumor progression compared with YAP1 knockdown or sorafenib alone.38,39
Conclusion
YAP1 is upregulated in both HCC tumor tissues and cell lines, and promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and EMT progression in vitro. Meanwhile, targeting YAP1 inhibits HCC progression and improves sensitivity to sorafenib in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that YAP1 may serve as a single or combined target in the treatment of HCC.

The role of pentraxin 3 in pemphigus vulgaris

Ibrahim Halil Yavuz, Goknur Ozaydin Yavuz
Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Van Yuzuncu Yil University, Van, Turkey Adv Dermatol Allergol 2020; XXXVII (4): 503-507 DOI: https://doi.org/10.5114/ada.2019.81234
Abstract
Introduction: Pemphigus is a group of autoimmune bullous diseases caused by antibodies directed against the desmosomal adhesion molecules desmoglein 1 and 3, which are required for intercellular adhesion of keratinocytes. Pentraxins are a group of proteins that function as pattern recognition molecules and also play a role in humoral innate immunity. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is the prototype of the long pentraxins and has been shown to be increased in numerous autoimmune diseases. Aim: To investigate whether PTX3 can be used as a marker of PV caused by autoimmunity and resulting in tissue injury. Material and methods: The study included 30 patients who presented to the University Medical School Dermatology Department and were diagnosed with PV based on clinical, histological, and immunological findings. The control group included 30 healthy individuals. Human PTX3 concentration was measured with a commercially available ELISA kit, using a double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The 60 participants comprised 31 (52%) men and 29 (48%) women.

Introduction
Pemphigus is a group of autoimmune bullous diseases caused by antibodies directed against the desmosomal adhesion molecules desmoglein 1 and 3, which are required for intercellular adhesion of keratinocytes [1]. Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is the most common form of these diseases, with an incidence of 0.1-0.5/100,000 and no gender preponderance. The PV is mostly seen between the fourth and sixth decades of life and is rarely seen in children and the elderly [2]. Although autoimmunity is the underlying cause of PV, the exact etiology of PV remains unknown. Nevertheless, several factors have been blamed, including infections, drugs, environmental factors, tumors, and various human leukocyte antigen alleles [3].
Common clinical manifestations of PV include vesicles and bullae that rupture easily, and a positive Nikolsky's sign is the distinguishing feature of the disease [2, 3]. Corticosteroids form the primary step in the treatment of PV. However, before the introduction of systemic corticosteroids, most of the patients died within 2 years

after diagnosis. With the development of corticosteroids and additional adjuvant therapies over the last decades, a significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality rates has been achieved [4, 5].
Pentraxins, also known as pentaxins, are a group of proteins that function as pattern recognition molecules and also play a role in humoral innate immunity. These proteins are divided into two groups: long pentraxins and short pentraxins. C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid P-component (SAP) are the two typical forms of short pentraxins and pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is the prototype of the long pentraxins. Short pentraxins are produced by hepatocytes while PTX3 is secreted by macrophages, polymorphonuclear cells, neutrophils, endothelial cells, dendritic cells, and smooth muscle cells. Moreover, while short pentraxins are a marker of systemic inflammation, PTX3 reflects local inflammation; therefore, PTX3 has the potential to be a more specific marker for some inflammatory diseases [6, 7]. On the other hand, PTX3 has been shown to be significantly increased in various conditions, particularly including tissue injury and inflammation

[8, 9]. Of note, while the normal serum PTX3 level is 2 ng/ml in healthy individuals, it can be remarkably high in the setting of inflammation, reaching 800 ng/ml within 6-8 h [7, 10]. In addition, serum PTX3 level has also been shown to be increased in numerous autoimmune diseases [11].
Aim
In this study, we aimed to investigate whether PTX3 can be used as a marker of PV caused by autoimmunity and resulting in tissue injury.
Material and methods
The study included 30 patients who presented to the University Medical School Dermatology Department and were diagnosed with PV based on clinical, histological, and immunological findings. The PV was diagnosed according to histopathological criteria including detection of intraepidermal vesicles with acantholysis on hematoxylin staining and IgG and C3 deposition with a fishnet staining pattern within the epidermis directed against cell surface antigens of keratinocytes on direct immunofluorescence staining. Criteria for inclusion in this study: 1) having a diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris; 2) active blister formation; 3) positive Nikolsky's sign; 4) receiving no treatment; 5) not being in remission. Exclusion criteria included the use of anti-inflammatory drugs that could affect serum PTX3 level within the last 2 weeks and a history of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases including renal and hepatic diseases, cardiac insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, malignancies, pregnancy, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and PV patients under treatment or in remission The control group included 30 healthy individuals with no family history of autoimmune and bullous diseases and no history of medical treatment. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Date: 23.03.2018, Number: 33) and a written consent form was obtained from each participant.
Blood sampling and analysis
Venous blood samples were obtained for routine biochemical analyses in the Dermatology Department. The samples were placed in yellow-top tubes with no anti-

coagulant and then transferred to the Biochemistry Department. Following the coagulation process, serum was separated after centrifuging at 1,500 g for 10 min. Human PTX3 concentration was measured with a commercially available ELISA kit, Eastbiopharm (Eastbiopharm, Zhejiang, China), using a double antibody sandwich enzymelinked immunosorbent assay. The PTX3 results were expressed as ng/ml.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc. Co., Chicago, IL, USA). Normal distribution of data was analyzed using histogram plots and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Descriptive statistics were expressed as mean, standard deviation (SD), and median. Data with non-normal distribution (nonparametric) were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test. Quantitative variables were compared using Spearman's correlation coefficient. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
The 60 participants comprised 31 (52%) men and 29 (48%) women. No significant difference was found between the two groups with regards to age or gender (p < 0.001) (Table 1).
The most common site of onset was mucosa + skin (n = 22; 73.3%) and a psychological pathology (anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, etc.) was present in 7 (23.3%) patients (Table 2).
Median PTX3 level was significantly higher in the PV group compared to the control group (2.8 vs. 1.0) (p = 0.008) (Table 3).
A ROC curve was produced to determine the cut-off value for PTX3 in the prediction of PV (Figure 1). Based on the ROC curve, the cut-off value was 1.849 and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.701 (range: 0.547-0.854), which was statistically significant (p = 0.008). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for PTX3 were 90%, 80.1%, 73.0%, and 87.0%, respectively (Figure 1).
The ROC curve analysis indicated a significant AUC value for serum PTX3 level in the prediction of PV. These values are presented in Table 4.

Discussion
The results indicated that serum PTX3 level was significantly higher in the PV patients compared to the healthy controls and that PTX3 can be a useful marker for PV. To our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature investigating the relationship between PTX3 and PV.
Autoimmunity in PV has been shown in numerous studies in the literature. In patients with PV, antibodies have mostly been identified in the lesional epidermis and in patients' sera. Moreover, a strong correlation was recently found between serum concentration of antibodies detected by indirect immunofluorescence and the activity and diagnosis of PV [12]. In addition, PV has been shown to be accompanied by various clinical conditions including myasthenia gravis, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and pernicious anemia [13].
The relationship between PTX3 and autoimmune diseases has been demonstrated in a large body of literature. Assandri et al., for instance, reported that plasma PTX3 level was higher in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) compared to healthy controls and the levels decreased after treatment [14]. The study concluded that PTX3 is a significant marker for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with SLE. Additionally, Sharma et al. revealed that PTX3 was a more sensitive indicator of clinical activity in patients with RA compared to CRP [15]. On the other hand, Huang et al. performed a meta-analysis on 20 studies evaluating the relationship between PTX3 and autoimmune diseases including SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic sclerosis [11]. The analysis showed that serum PTX3 concentration is higher in patients with autoimmune diseases compared to healthy individuals. Similarly, PTX3, together with complement components, has also been shown to have a role in the removal of apoptotic cells in some autoimmune diseases [16, 17]. In our study, we also

found that serum PTX3 concentration was higher in PV, similarly to other autoimmune diseases.
Literature reviews indicate that there is no clear evidence to date of active bacteria in PV. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the exfoliative toxins of S. aureus bind to desmoglein 1, thereby leading to loss of adhesion, in a similar way to the antibodies in PV [18]. Therefore, some infections are likely to play a role in the activation of PV although they may not be the exact cause of the disease, which implies that the increased PTX3 concentration in PV could be associated with the increased PTX3 concentration in infections. On the other hand, circulating neutrophils migrate to the extravascular sites as a response to tissue injury, thereby leading to the release of PTX3 stored in neutrophils. Subsequently, the resulting inflammation cytokines, particularly IL-1b and TNF-, stimulate PTX3 synthesis during this process [7, 8, 19].
Increased PTX3 concentration in PV is likely to be caused by the inflammation resulting from acantholysis formation. PTX3 is a key component of humoral immunity, mainly due to its role in the removal of apoptotic cells and cell debris at the site of tissue injury [20]. In a previous meta-analysis, Schmidt and Waschke demonstrated that apoptosis is an important parameter in pemphigus, also noting that nuclear changes and cellular death are the key markers of apoptosis in the setting of acantholysis [17]. In our study, our results also implied that the increased serum PTX3 level in PV could be a result of apoptosis.
It is commonly known that PTX3 does not exist on normal human skin. A previous study showed PTX3 expression in the skin biopsies of patients with severe psoriasis. The study also showed a correlation between PTX3 and the severity and activity of psoriasis [21]. Several other studies have also indicated that PTX3 also has a key role in diseases with a significant dermatological component such as leprosy, urticaria, and Behçet's disease and that it could be a novel marker for these diseases. Moreover, these studies also suggested that PTX3 could be responsible for the expression of inflammatory mediators [22-24]. In our study, PTX3 was found to be increased in PV, as in other inflammatory skin diseases. Based on this finding, it could be asserted that PTX3 could be a more valuable parameter in the activation of PV rather than its diagnosis.
Berksoy Hayta et al. evaluated CRP in 43 patients with PV and 40 healthy volunteers and found that CRP was higher in the PV patients compared to the controls [25]. Similarly, Severo et al. showed that CRP is a useful inflammatory marker in dogs with pemphigus foliaceus. In our study, we evaluated PTX3, which is a similar inflammatory marker to CRP, and we consider that PTX3 is a more specific marker for PV than CRP since PTX3 is expressed by three different cells and is increased in the setting of local inflammation alone, as compared to CRP,

which is produced by the liver alone and is increased in the settings of numerous systemic diseases [26].
Brenner et al. in their study found that garlic compounds led to acantholysis in the in vitro environment. They suggested that foods may have a role in diseases such as pemphigus [27]. Ruocco et al. reported a case of a 49-year-old patient with pemphigus which became worse because of excessive garlic consumption and her disease was controlled following the removal of garlic from the diet [28]. Pietkiewicz et al. evaluated pemphigus patients in the area near a wastewater treatment plant in Poland. The study claimed that some chemical factors (pesticides, thiols, amides, phenols) could trigger autoimmunity in pemphigus [29]. According to a study, the intake of food rich in thiols such as onion, garlic, and leek may be suspected of triggering pemphigus [30]. In our study, we found that most of our patients (90%) had a high intake of food suspected of triggering pemphigus, which indicates that patients with pemphigus should avoid consuming such foods.
Our study was limited in several ways. First, it was a single-center study with a relatively small patient series. Additionally, no evaluation was performed for other short pentraxins including CRP and SAP and long pentraxins including apexin, neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1), and neuronal pentraxin 2 (NP2). Accordingly, different outcomes could have been obtained if more pentraxins had been evaluated. PTX3 should not be regarded as a specific marker in PV disease, because PTX3 level can be increased in numerous autoimmune diseases. Therefore, an important drawback of this study is absence of a positive control group. Bullous pemphigoid could be ideal from this point of view, as it is closely related to PV; namely, both diseases share autoimmunity to keratinocyte adhesion molecules.
Conclusions
PTX3 was found to be increased in PV, as in other autoimmune diseases. Accordingly, PTX3 could be a useful indicator of disease activity in PV. Moreover, compared to the expensive anti-desmoglein antibodies that have been commonly used in the diagnosis and activity of PV over the last decades, PTX3 could be a promising indicator of disease activity due to its reasonable cost. Further prospective studies are needed to substantiate our findings.

Abstract
Background
Scope

Flowering plant seeds originate from a unique double-fertilization event, which involves two sperm cells and two female gametes, the egg cell and the central cell. For many years our knowledge of mechanisms involved in angiosperm fertilization remained minimal. It was obvious that several signals were required to explain how the male gametes are delivered inside the maternal reproductive tissues to the two female gametes but their molecular nature remained unknown. The difficulties in imaging the double-fertilization process prevented the identification of the mode of sperm cell delivery. It was believed that the two sperm cells were not functionally equivalent.
We review recent studies that have significantly improved our understanding of the early steps of double fertilization. The attractants of the pollen tube have been identified as small proteins produced by the synergid cells that surround the egg cell. Genetic studies have identified the signalling pathways required for the release of male gametes from the pollen tube. High-resolution imaging of the trajectory of the two male gametes showed that their transport does not involve the synergid cells directly and that isomorphic male gametes are functionally equivalent. We also outline major outstanding issues in the field concerned with the barrier against polyspermy, gamete recognition and mechanisms that prevent interspecies crosses.

Introduction
Flowering plants (angiosperms) have evolved a unique fertilization process, called `double fertilization'. Two sperm cells fertilize two female gametophytic cells: the egg cell and the central cell (Fig. 1; Appendix). After fertilization, the embryo develops from the fertilized egg cell and the central cell gives rise to the endosperm, which nourishes the embryo for its development. These

two fertilization events are tightly controlled temporally and spatially, and take place in a coordinated manner to ensure successful embryogenesis. Unlike animals and lower land plants, such as bryophytes, lycophytes and ferns, flowering plant sperm cells are immotile and delivered to the female gametophyte by pollen grains. The pollen grain consists of two sperm cells inside a vegetative cell. After pollen deposition on the stigma,

Fig. 1 Schematic representation of sexual reproduction in A. thaliana. The pollen grain, once hydrated on the stigma, elongates the pollen tube into the style. After emerging onto the surface of the placenta, the pollen tube keeps elongating to reach the funiculus, which connects the placenta and the ovule. When the ovule is not fertilized, the pollen tube is guided to grow onto the surface of the funiculus to the ovule by unknown mechanisms (funicular guidance). The chemoattractants secreted from the synergid cells then guide the pollen tube to the micropyle of the ovule (micropylar guidance). The pollen tube stops its growth (pollen tube perception), and discharges sperm cells. The two sperm cells are released and one fertilizes with the egg and the other with the central cell, giving rise to the embryo and the endosperm, respectively (double fertilization).

the vegetative cell elongates the pollen tube into the ovary to deliver two sperm cells (Fig. 1). A successful double fertilization depends on (i) proper guidance of the pollen tube to the unfertilized embryo sac (Appendix), (ii) release of the two sperm cells towards the egg cell and the central cell, (iii) recognition and fusion between each pair of gametes (plasmogamy, Appendix), and (iv) fusion between gamete nuclei (karyogamy, Appendix) and zygotic activation. During the past few years, identification of gamete-specific genes and promoters made it possible to mark gametes, allowing gamete transcriptome analyses (Borges et al. 2008) and in vivo imaging of double fertilization (Berger 2011). Moreover, in vivo live-cell imaging with high resolution has addressed controversial questions of double fertilization (Ge et al. 2011; Hamamura et al. 2011). Here, we review recent findings pertaining to signalling events during double fertilization.
Pollen tube guidance: directional pollen tube growth to the female gametophyte
On the stigma, pollen grains hydrate and germinate to initiate pollen tube growth into the transmitting tissues of the ovary (Fig. 1). The pollen tube then emerges on the surface of the placenta and is guided to grow onto

the funiculus (funicular guidance), which connects the embryo sac and placenta. The pollen tube eventually reaches the micropyle (Appendix) of the embryo sac (micropylar guidance). Remarkable advances have been made in our understanding of micropylar guidance (Marton and Dresselhaus 2010; Okuda and Higashiyama 2010; Sprunck 2010). It was first demonstrated experimentally in vitro that the synergid cells (Appendix) of the female gametophyte primarily govern micropylar guidance in Torenia fournieri (Higashiyama et al. 2001). In Arabidopsis thaliana, MYB98 is a transcription factor expressed preferentially in synergid cells (Fig. 2A). The myb98 mutant shows defects in the organization of the filiform apparatus of synergid cells and micropylar guidance of pollen tubes, demonstrating that proper function of synergid cells is essential for micropylar guidance (Kasahara et al. 2005).
Several attempts have been made to identify pollen tube attractants secreted by synergid cells. Many MYB98dependent synergid-specific transcripts were identified, including those encoding cysteine-rich polypeptides (CRPs) that are secreted to the filiform apparatus (Punwani et al. 2007, 2008). Whether these secreted CRPs are required for pollen tube micropylar guidance in A. thaliana remains to be determined, but pollen tube attractants were identified in Zea mays (maize)

Fig. 2 Schematic representation of the role of genes involved in the early steps of double fertilization in A. thaliana. (A) The pollen tube on the funiculus is guided to the micropyle of the unfertilized ovule. Chemo-attractants such as LUREs in Arabidopsis and ZmEA1 in maize are secreted from the synergid cells through the filiform apparatus, generating a concentration gradient to conduct the directional growth of the pollen tube into the micropylar end of the embryo sac. (B) Through communication between the synergid cell and the pollen tube, the pollen tube arrests its elongation at the proper position and prepares for pollen tube discharge. (C) Pollen tube discharge generates cytoplasmic flow of the pollen tube content, which is likely to be sufficient for sperm cells to migrate directly into the intercellular region between the egg cell and the central cell.

and Torenia (Fig. 2A). The maize gene ZmEA1 encodes a polymorphic small protein and the ZmEA1- GFP fusion protein is detected in the cell wall that surrounds the synergid cells. Knockdown of ZmEA1 affects the entrance of the pollen tube in the intercellular space of the micropyle (Marton et al. 2005). In vitro analyses

showed that the predicted mature ZmEA1 protein can attract maize pollen tubes directly (Dresselhaus and Marton 2009; Marton and Dresselhaus 2010), further supporting the idea that the ZmEA1 protein is the attractant for micropylar guidance. In T. fournieri, LURE1 and LURE2 encode CRPs, which belong to a subgroup of the

defensin-like gene superfamily, and are expressed highly in the synergid cells (Okuda et al. 2009). LUREs are secreted from the synergid cells to the filiform apparatus, and morpholino knockdown prevents proper pollen tube attraction. In vitro pollen tube attraction assay demonstrated that LURE1 and 2 indeed attract Torenia pollen tubes (Okuda et al. 2009), confirming that LURE1 and 2 are truly the attractants for micropylar guidance. LURE homologues from Torenia concolor are also expressed in synergid cells but are poor attractants for pollen tubes of T. fournieri, suggesting that LUREs might participate in the prevention of cross-fertilization between species (Kanaoka et al. 2011). Arabidopsis synergid cells also express and secrete defensin-like CRPs to the filiform apparatus (Punwani et al. 2007, 2008), and further analyses will be necessary to understand whether defensin-like CRPs secreted by Arabidopsis synergid cells are also involved in micropylar guidance.
Pollen tube perception: pollen tube growth arrest and rupture
After arriving at the micropylar end of the female gametophyte, the pollen tube stops elongation. This is followed by pollen tube rupture and sperm cell release for successful double fertilization (Fig. 2; Weterings and Russell 2004). Genetics in Arabidopsis have identified several gametophytic factors involved in pollen tube perception. For example, ABSTINENCE BY MUTUAL CONSENT (AMC) encodes a peroxin, which is important for protein transport into peroxisomes, and the amc mutation causes defects in pollen tube perception only when both the male and female gametophytes carry the mutant amc allele (Boisson-Dernier et al. 2008). By contrast, many factors found to be important for pollen perception are female or male gamete specific, and analyses on these factors revealed that communications between the pollen tube and synergid cells are essential, as detailed in the following paragraph.
How do synergid cells sense pollen tube arrival?
FERONIA (FER) encodes a receptor-like serine/threonine kinase (RLK) (Escobar-Restrepo et al. 2007). When faced with fer female gametophytes, wild-type pollen tubes fail to arrest growth and invade the female gametophyte without sperm release (Huck et al. 2003; Rotman et al. 2003). The FER -GFP fusion protein is expressed in synergid cells and localized at the filiform apparatus, presumably playing a role in sensing pollen tube arrival. Recently, other mutants exhibiting female gametophytic fer-like phenotype have been identified: lorelei (lre,

LRE encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositolanchored protein) (Capron et al. 2008; Tsukamoto et al. 2010), scylla (syl) (Rotman et al. 2008) and nortia (nta, NTA encodes a MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O family protein) (Fig. 2B; Kessler et al. 2010). LRE and NTA are expressed in synergid cells, and NTA- GFP fusion protein localizes at the filiform apparatus which extends the membrane of the synergid cells toward the micropyle. Furthermore, the filiform apparatus localization of NTA- GFP fusion protein takes place upon pollen tube arrival, and is FER dependent (Kessler et al. 2010). This suggests that the FER pathway is important for sensing pollen tube arrival and re-localizes NTA in the synergid cell upon pollen tube arrival (Boisson-Dernier et al. 2011). It remains unclear, however, how the re-localization of NTA is important for pollen tube perception and whether the FER pathway is involved only in the pollen tube and synergid cell communication. Interestingly, the NTA gene belongs to the plant-specific MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O family, which was first identified in the context of powdery mildew susceptibility in barley (Bu¨ schges et al. 1997). Furthermore, it was possible to obtain fer homozygous mutant plants, and these showed powdery mildew resistance (Kessler et al. 2010), implying that pollen tube perception and the fungal invasion pathway share some molecular components. Genes closely related to FER and NTA are found in bryophytes (Devoto et al. 2003; Lehti-Shiu et al. 2009), suggesting that FER and NTA in flowering plants might have evolved from ancestral proteins with functions unrelated to pollen tube perception. It is still unclear whether FER and NTA homologues in bryophytes have functions in fungal invasion. What the ancient functions of original FER and NTA proteins were, and how FER and NTA developed those functions in flowering plants, remain elusive.
Are other female gametophyte cells involved in pollen tube perception?
Additional evidence suggested that FER might also be involved in the communication between female gametophytic cells for pollen tube perception (Rotman et al. 2008). In addition to a fer-like phenotype, syl triggers autonomous endosperm development without fertilization, a trait associated with the FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS) class mutants. This discovery led to re-investigations of the fer mutant using the sirene (srn) allele. srn/fer mutants also showed autonomous endosperm development and further demonstrated synergistic interactions with the fis2 mutant. fis2 also displayed defects in pollen tube discharge as in srn/fer, demonstrating that the central cell is also important for pollen tube perception and that FER might also play a role in pollen tube perception, which involves

the communication between synergid cells and the central cell (Fig. 2B; Rotman et al. 2008). A possible involvement of the central cell for pollen tube perception is also pointed out by the analysis of CENTRAL CELL GUIDANCE (CCG), encoding a putative transcriptional regulator expressed in the central cell. The ccg mutation causes a loss of pollen tube micropylar guidance (Fig. 2A; Chen et al. 2007). Consistently, the communication between the central cell and other female gametophytic cells for proper development has also been recently reported (Ka¨ gi et al. 2010). Further studies are now required to identify FER ligands and where these are secreted (from the central cell and/or the pollen tube) to activate the FER pathway in the synergid cell for pollen tube perception.
How does the pollen tube control its growth and rupture?
The closest paralogues of SRN/FER, ANXUR1 and 2 (ANX1 and 2), expressed in the pollen tube, are also critical for pollen tube perception (Fig. 2C; Boisson-Dernier et al. 2009; Miyazaki et al. 2009). The double knockout mutant pollens are able to germinate and elongate the pollen tube, but rupture prematurely without reaching the female gametophyte, indicating that the ANX pathway is preventing premature pollen tube rupture (Miyazaki et al. 2009). The possible function of ANX for pollen tube perception has been postulated; the ANXs might function in a cell-autonomous manner (Berger 2009). In this scenario, the pollen tube would maintain ANXs activation in a positive feedback loop until the tip reaches the synergid cell where the extracellular environment would contain factors involved in quenching the ANXs pathway. Further analyses are anticipated that will reveal more of the precise molecular mechanisms by which ANXs control pollen tube growth arrest and rupture.
Defensin-like Zea mays Embryo Sac 4 (ZmES4) protein was identified as a putative signalling molecule controlling pollen tube rupture (Fig. 2C; Amien et al. 2010). ZmES4 is expressed in maize synergid cells, and is capable of triggering pollen tube rupture in vitro. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that ZmES4 is able to open a potassium channel (K+-channel Zea mays 1) expressed in the pollen tube in a heterologous system. Previously, the Ca2+ pump ACA9 in the Arabidopsis pollen tube has been shown to be involved in pollen tube discharge (Schiøtt et al. 2004). The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which ions such as K+ and Ca2+ play roles in pollen tube perception remain to be determined.

Sperm cell dynamics: sperm cell release and gamete recognition
The lack of high-resolution in vivo methods to analyse sperm dynamics during fertilization prevented an understanding of how sperm cells migrate and many hypotheses arose to explain the cellular mechanisms of double fertilization (Berger et al. 2008). However, rapid advances in technology and methodology, such as spatiotemporal high-resolution confocal microscopy coupled with cellspecific fluorescent markers, now allow the process of double fertilization to be dissected in much greater detail (Berger 2011).
When and where are the two sperm cells released?
Once the pollen tube reaches the micropylar end of the female gametophyte, its growth arrest and release of the two sperm cells take place by rupture of the pollen tube tip through interaction with the synergid cells (Fig. 2C). In vivo observations suggested that degeneration of the synergid cell takes place at the time of pollen tube arrival in Arabidopsis (Rotman et al. 2003; Sandaklie-Nikolova et al. 2007) or at pollen tube rupture in Torenia (Higashiyama et al. 2000). However, the mechanisms responsible for the transport of the two sperm cells remain unclear. It was proposed that the two sperm cells are released into the degenerated synergid cell and are transported to the gamete fusion site by an active mechanism involving the cytoskeleton (Huang and Russell 1994). An alternative hypothesis proposes that the two sperm cells are transported passively by the cytoplasmic flow of the pollen tube content discharged between the synergid and the egg cell. This issue was addressed by Hamamura et al. (2011) using high temporal resolution imaging of Arabidopsis pollen tube rupture. With a sampling rate of 0.20- 0.33 s, the authors demonstrated that the maximum velocity of the sperm cells right after pollen tube discharge is 10 mm s21 and the duration of the rapid migration phase is of the order of 10 s. After sperm cell release is completed, the two sperm cells apparently become wedged between the central cell and the egg cell, and do not change position until gamete fusion (plasmogamy). If sperm cells were deposited in synergids and transferred to the female gametes by cytoskeletal elements, a pause after the initial pollen burst should be observed, followed by migration at a rate of 0.1 - 1 mm s21 (the typical range of speed of transport along the cytoskeleton) (Staiger 2000). Hence, live imaging observations indicate that the cytoplasmic flow by pollen tube rupture is sufficient for the sperm cells to reach the site of gamete fusions. This finding is consistent with the observation in Torenia (Higashiyama et al.

2000), and this may indicate that the sperm cell delivery by cytoplasmic flow is conserved among flowering plants. The pollen tube cytoplasm could be injected between the egg cell and one synergid cell, creating a channel for the delivery of sperm cells between the plasma membranes of the synergid cell and the egg cell. The end of this channel reaches the contact between the egg cell and the central cell plasma membranes where sperm cells remain immobile until plasmogamy (Hamamura et al. 2011). Synergid cell degeneration would be a secondary event, resulting either from a specific signalling mechanism or from the mechanical stress caused by the burst of pollen tube cytoplasm (Fig. 2C).
Do dimorphic sperm cells prevent polyspermy in double fertilization?
Successful double fertilization relies on two independent gamete cell fusions. One sperm cell must fuse with the egg cell and the other with the central cell. As Hamamura et al. (2011) demonstrated, the two sperm cells are released at the site of gamete fusion simultaneously. If one sperm cell is able to fuse with the egg cell while the other is able to fuse with the central cell, coordination of the two fertilization events is secured and polyspermy (Appendix) is prevented. Plumbago zeylanica produces dimorphic sperm cells, which express different sets of transcripts (Gou et al. 2009). Each sperm cell shows preferential fertilization to the egg cell or the central cell, depending on its identity (Russell 1985). Arabidopsis, like most flowering plant species, produces isomorphic sperm cells that cannot be distinguished by gene expression--so far (Ge et al. 2011). However, only one of the two sperm cells is associated in closer vicinity with the vegetative nucleus of the pollen (Fig. 2A and B) (McCue et al. 2011). This association involves the outer endocytic membrane that surrounds both sperm cells. It is thus possible that one sperm cell receives specific signals from the vegetative nucleus that would determine its capacity to fuse preferentially with one female gamete (McCue et al. 2011). Therefore, it has been an issue of debate whether sperm cells are functionally equivalent.
The question of sperm functional differentiation was initially tested in Arabidopsis mutants that produce multiple egg cells or a single sperm cell (Berger 2011). Mutants eostre (Pagnussat et al. 2007) and retinoblastoma related 1 (Ingouff et al. 2006, 2009) generate two egg cells, which can be fertilized by both sperm cells delivered by a single pollen tube. Furthermore, mutants chromatin assembly factor 1 (Chen et al. 2008) and cyclin dependent kinase a;1 (cdka;1) (Aw et al. 2010) produce a single sperm cell per pollen

grain, which shows the ability to fertilize either the egg cell or the central cell. Only a single sperm-like cell formed by translational inhibition in the male germ cell shows preferential fertilization to the central cell (Frank and Johnson 2009). Although these studies supported an equivalent functional identity for both sperm cells, they were not conclusive because they did not involve wild-type sperm cells and wild-type female gametes. To end this controversy, Hamamura et al. (2011) used a photo-convertible fluorescent protein to mark each sperm cell differently and examined the preferentiality of fertilization of two sperm cells delivered by a wild-type pollen tube to a wild-type ovule. Both sperm cells in either position (associated with the vegetative nucleus or not) fertilize the egg cell and the central cell with a similar probability, demonstrating that Arabidopsis sperm cells are functionally equivalent.
The equivalence of Arabidopsis sperm cells raises the issue of polyspermy block (Appendix). Circumstantial evidence has suggested the presence of polyspermy block in plants (Spielman and Scott 2008). Arabidopsis mutants tetraspore (Scott et al. 2008) and retinoblastoma related 1 (Ingouff et al. 2009) also indicated the presence of polyspermy block in the egg cell. Live-cell imaging in wild type has provided support to these results (Hamamura et al. 2011). The two plasmogamies take place simultaneously within less than 1 min, and in spite of simultaneous fusions of the sperm cells, the authors did not observe two fusion events with the egg cell or with the central cell. Because the two sperm cells are both equally able to fuse with either female gamete, these observations suggest that polyspermy is prevented not only in the egg cell but also in the central cell. It remains unknown what cellular and molecular mechanisms prevent polyspermy (polyspermy block) in the egg cell and the central cell, and whether there are any differences in polyspermy block between the two female gametes.
A few factors essential for plasmogamy have been identified. GENERATIVE SPECIFIC CELL 1/HAPLESS 2 (GCS1/HAP2) was first discovered in Lilium longiflorum to be sperm cell specific and affect plasmogamy when mutated (Mori et al. 2006). The GCS1/HAP2 protein localizes at the sperm cell membrane and its function is essential for gamete fusion and is highly conserved among major eukaryotic taxa (Besser et al. 2006; Mori et al. 2006; Wong and Johnson 2010). Although there is no known functional domain identified in GCS1/ HAP2, the putative extracellular N-terminus, containing the conserved HAP2- GCS1 domain, seems critical for its function (Mori et al. 2010; Wong et al. 2010). In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, GCS1/HAP2 proteins are targeted for rapid degradation immediately after gamete fusion,

presumably involved in polygamy block (Liu et al. 2010). What molecular mechanisms control the GCS1/HAP2 pathway for gamete fusion and whether rapid degradation of GCS1/HAP2 occurs in flowering plants for polyspermy block remain to be determined.
ANKYRIN REPEAT PROTEIN 6 (ANK6) has recently been identified as another factor essential for gamete fusion in Arabidopsis (Yu et al. 2010). ANK6 encodes a mitochondria-targeted protein with ankyrin repeats which are believed to act in protein -protein interaction. ANK6 is highly expressed in both the male and female gametophytes and gamete fusion is impaired between mutant ank6 gametes (Yu et al. 2010). ANK6 interacts with SIG5, a mitochondrial transcriptional initiation factor, implying that ANK6 controls gamete fusion by regulating mitochondrial gene expression. Further analyses will be awaited to reveal molecular mechanisms by which mitochondria play a role in gamete fusion through ANK6.
Post-plasmogamy
After plasmogamy, each sperm nucleus joins and fuses with either the egg cell nucleus or the central nucleus. This step, called karyogamy (Appendix), is followed by zygotic activation and embryo and endosperm development. Mutations in a chaperone involved in karyogamy in yeast affect polar nuclei (Appendix) fusion in the Arabidopsis central cell but do not impair karyogamy directly (Maruyama et al. 2010), similar to other mutants affecting polar nuclear fusion in the female gametophyte (Portereiko et al. 2006). The molecular mechanisms controlling karyogamy remain unknown. Similarly, little is known concerning zygotic activation. Karyogamy in the central cell is immediately followed by the onset of mitosis and translational activation, whereas it takes
6 -8 h in the zygote to detect the first sign of de novo zygotic transcription and translation (Aw et al. 2010; Ingouff et al. 2010). Surprisingly, it has recently been discovered that plasmogamy is sufficient to activate mitosis in the central cell (Aw et al. 2010). The cdka;1 mutant produces pollen with one or, more often, two sperm cells. When wild-type ovules are fertilized by cdka;1 pollen that delivers two sperm cells, embryogenesis is initiated correctly although the developing seed eventually aborts. The embryo abortion results from endosperm development arrest after a few mitotic divisions. Endosperm arrest is caused by failure of karyogamy after fertilization of the central cell. These results imply that plasmogamy in the central cell is sufficient to activate mitotic division, but the paternal genome is required for subsequent endosperm development. By contrast, mitotic activation by sperm entry is not observed in the egg cell (Aw et al. 2010).

These findings indicate that (i) plasmogamy signals mitotic activation in the central cell and (ii) the molecular mechanisms associated with zygotic activation could differ between the egg cell and the central cell. This hypothesis is also supported by earlier findings showing that activation of the central cell, but not the egg cell, takes place in the absence of the Polycomb group pathway (Ohad et al. 1996; Chaudhury et al. 1997; Guitton et al. 2004) while autonomous egg cell activation depends on the WD40 protein MSI1 but not on the Polycomb group pathway (Guitton and Berger 2005). What activates the mitotic onset in the egg cell and the central cell remains elusive. Factors involved in plasmogamy such as the GCS1/HAP2 pathway (Besser et al. 2006; Mori et al. 2006), cytoplasmic activation signals in the sperm cell (Bayer et al. 2009) or calcium signalling as shown in the brown alga Fucus and maize (Roberts et al. 1994; Antoine et al. 2000) might be contributing to the central cell mitotic activation.
Conclusions and forward look
Many factors controlling successful double fertilization have been identified in recent years, including important signalling pathways. It is now obvious that communication between the female and male gametophytes is essential. Furthermore, communication within the gametophyte, such as the central cell and the synergid cell, seems critical for double fertilization. Chemical visualization of LUREs will allow an understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of pollen tube attraction (Goto et al. 2011). Yet, there are still many pieces missing in the signalling pathway jigsaw puzzle. What are the receptors of LUREs and ZmEA1 in the pollen tube for micropylar guidance? What are the ligands of SRN/FER and ANXs, and what is the receptor of ZmES4 for pollen tube perception? How do these pathways coordinate a successful double fertilization? These questions await answers.
Identification of factors associated with fertilization processes and high-resolution live-cell imaging now enable us to investigate other aspects of fertilization such as the interspecies barrier and the polyspermy block. Micropylar guidance attractants such as LUREs and ZmEA1 belong to highly polymorphic families, and indeed LUREs show species preferentiality on pollen tube guidance (Okuda and Higashiyama 2010; Kanaoka et al. 2011). In addition, species specificity of GCS1/HAP2 has also been explored (Mori et al. 2010; Wong et al. 2010), indicating that the interspecies barrier even exists in the last steps of fertilization. Polyspermy block also appears to be present in flowering plants to reinforce successful double fertilization (Scott et al. 2008; Spielman and Scott 2008; Ingouff et al. 2009; Hamamura et al. 2011).

The fact that there is a considerable time gap between sperm cell release and plasmogamy suggests cell - cell communication among gametes, presumably involved in polyspermy block and preparation for plasmogamy. We have just started to lend an ear to the conversation between male and female gametophytes, `green love talks', and, surely, we will soon acquire deeper mechanistic insights into double fertilization.

Appendix: Glossary of terms
Central cell
The female gametophytic cell that develops as the endosperm after fertilization. In contrast to the haploid egg cell, the central cell is a homodiploid cell.
Double fertilization
Flowering plants have evolved a unique fertilization process, which involves two sperm cells and two female gametophytic cells, the egg and the central cell. Each sperm cell fertilizes with the egg or the

central cell, giving rise to the embryo and the endosperm, respectively.
Egg cell The female gametophytic cell that develops as the embryo after fertilization.
Embryo sac This is the mature female gametophyte. The two terms are somehow synonymous.
Karyogamy Fusion of the nuclei of the male and female gametes.
Micropyle The part of the ovule where the pollen tube accesses the embryo sac.
Plasmogamy The fusion of the plasma membrane between a male and a female gamete.
Polar nuclei The central cell inherits two haploid nuclei, which localize to the micropylar pole of the cell and are called polar nuclei. The polar nuclei fuse during central cell maturation and the central cell thus become homodiploid.
Pollen tube guidance In order to deliver immotile sperm cells to the female gametophyte in flowering plants, the pollen tube carrying the sperm cells grows towards the unfertilized female gametophyte. This directional growth of the pollen tube is controlled by the maternal tissue and the female gametophyte.
Polyspermy block The process that prevents the egg cell or the central cell from being fertilized by more than one sperm cell. Because the pollen tube delivers two sperm cells at the position where the fertilization takes place, it has been suggested that a polyspermy block is required for successful double fertilization.
Synergid cell The female gametophytic cell that secretes small peptides that attract the pollen tube. In A. thaliana, there are two synergid cells positioned on either side of the egg cell at the micropylar end of the female gametophyte.

Stereoselective degradation behaviour of carfentrazone-ethyl and its metabolite carfentrazone in soils
Jinsheng Duan,ab Beibei Gao,a Xu Dong,b Mingna Sun,b Yang Shen,b Zhaoxian Zhang,a Tongchun Gaob and Minghua Wang *a
The stereoselective environmental behaviour of carfentrazone-ethyl and its metabolite carfentrazone enantiomer in three types of soil were studied under aerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, significant stereoselective difference in the degradation behaviour of carfentrazone-ethyl and its metabolite carfentrazone enantiomer was observed in Jiangxi red soil, Jilin black soil and Anhui paddy soil. The EF values of the carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers in Anhui paddy soil, Jilin black soil, and Jiangxi red soil were 0.67, 0.65 and 0.57, respectively. The EF values of the carfentrazone enantiomer in the three types of soil were 0.75, 0.80 and 0.76. No bidirectional chiral inversion of enantiopure carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers was observed in Jilin soil. As a result, R(+)-carfentrazone-ethyl and S-(+)-carfentrazone in soil would be preferentially degraded, while S(À)-carfentrazone-ethyl and R-(À)-carfentrazone were enriched. The results found in this paper could provide more scientific guidance for the risk assessments of carfentrazone-ethyl from a chiral perspective.

1. Introduction
Aer application, most chiral pesticides dispersed into air or settle on the soil surface, leaving only a small proportion absorbed by plants. The enantiomers of these chiral pesticides oen exhibit different characteristics during their migration and transformation in living bodies or the environment, such as adsorption, enrichment, transformation, metabolism and degradation.1-5 Soil is an important component of environmental media for the transformation, migration and digestion of pesticide residues.6 Study of the stereoselectivity behavior of chiral pesticides in the environmental media can provide a more accurate environmental risk evaluation.7-15 The complexity of the soil system determines the abundance of chiral factors in it, such as the microbial community structure and the enzyme system. They all constitute the environment for chiral pesticide degradation. Therefore, it is essential to carry out a study on the stereoselectivity of chiral pesticides to investigate pesticide behaviour in the soil environment.3
Through the research on the 20 types of soils, Buerge et al. found that under aerobic conditions, the selective degradation

of metalaxyl in soil is closely related with the soil pH.16 When the soil pH > 5, the R-enantiomer of metalaxyl showed a higher degradation rate. When 4 < pH < 5, the degradation rates of the two enantiomers were roughly equal, and the S-enantiomer was preferentially degraded when pH < 4. Romero et al. discovered that the S-enantiomers of 2-methyl-chlorophenoxypropionic acid and 2,4-D-propionic acid in the sludge and the sandy soil remained for a longer period than the R-enantiomers, but the opposite phenomenon was observed in clay.17 In the three types of soil, the R-enantiomers of the two herbicides could be transformed into the S-enantiomers. Poiger et al. studied the stereoselective degradation of haloxyfop-2-ethoxyethyl in soils and found that haloxyfop-2-ethoxyethyl could transfer to piperoxolinic acid in fresh soils with the passage of time, and the S-enantiomer could transform to the R-enantiomer quickly.18 Sun et al. studied the degradation behaviors of the indoxacarb enantiomers in different types of agricultural eld soil and found that the indoxacarb enantiomers degraded quickly in alkali soil while degraded not so quickly as that in acid soils.19 Moreover, they discussed the effects of the soil organic matter content on the degradation of the indoxacarb enantiomers and concluded that the higher organic matter content could result in a stronger selective degradation behaviour.
Carfentrazone-ethyl is a broad-spectrum, systemic, selective post-emergence triazolone herbicide. Carfentrazone-ethyl inhibit the activity of the protoporphyrin oxidase(PPO) and interfere the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway of plants. It has been widely used to control broadleaf grasses in crop elds,

such as rice, wheat, soybean and corn. To date, the existing studies on the degradation behaviours of carfentrazone-ethyl residues mainly focused on racemes.20,21 As for the studies on the stereoselective degradation behaviours of carfentrazoneethyl and its metabolite carfentrazone still without report.
In this study, a chiral multiresidues analysis method of the chiral carfentrazone-ethyl and its chiral metabolites carfentrazone enantiomers in soils were established on the basis of the optimization of the QuEchERS method and LC MS/MS. The stereoselective degradation behaviors of carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers in different soils were studied for the rst time through an indoor incubation test. The degradation of enantiopure carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone isomers in Jilin soil was used to study the chiral stability. This paper could provide scientic and theoretical references for the environmental risks evaluation of carfentrazone-ethyl.
2. Materials and methods

The carfentrazone-ethyl raceme (95% purity) was provided by Institute for the Control of Agrochemicals, Ministry of Agriculture (Beijing, China). R-(+)-Carfentrazone-ethyl, S-(À)-carfentrazone-ethyl, S-(+)-carfentrazone and R-(À)-carfentrazone (>95% purity and >98% optical purity) were prepared by Shanghai Qinlu Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Chromatography grade methanol and acetonitrile were obtained from TEDIA (Faireld, Connecticut, USA). Chromatographically pure ammonium acetate and formic acid were obtained from Aladdin Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The ultra-pure water was Watsons puried water.
The dispersing agents primary secondary amine (PSA) was provided by Bonar Agela Technology Company (Tianjin, China). Analytical grade acetonitrile, anhydrous magnesium sulphate and sodium chloride were obtained from the National Pharmaceutical Chemical Reagent Company (Shanghai, China). Enantioseparation and analyses were performed using an LCMS-8030 ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with Super-chiral S-AD-RH (150 mm Â 4.6 mm, 5 mm) (Shanghai Qinlu Biotech Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China); CHIRALCEL AD-3R (150 mm Â 2.1 mm, 3 mm) (Daicel, Tokyo, Japan) and CHIRALCEL OD-3R(150 mm Â 2.1 mm, 3 mm) (Daicel, Tokyo, Japan). The HC-3018 high-speed centrifuge (Anhui Zhongke Zhongjia Scientic Instrument Co., Ltd. Hefei, China), M3 vortex oscillator (IKA company, Germany), and a nylon lter membrane (0.22 mm, ANPEL Company, USA) were used.

2.2 Soil sample preparation
Three kinds of soils (Jilin black soil, Jiangxi red soil and Anhui paddy soil) representing different physicochemical properties and climatic environments were collected from the 0-10 cm agricultural eld and mixed thoroughly. The soil samples were air-dried and sied by a 2 mm sieve, and then stored in the dark at 4 C. The physicochemical parameters of the three kinds of soils were listed in Table 1.
2.3 Soil pre-culture
Approximately 2 kg of each types of soil samples were precultured at 25 C, respectively. Meanwhile, water was sprayed on the soils to keep the water content at 60% of saturation moisture capacity of the soils. The soils were incubated for 2 weeks at 25 C. During the culture, the water contents of the soils were adjusted timely to maintain the original state. The saturation moisture capacities of the paddy soil in Anhui, red soil in Jiangxi and black soil in Jilin were 23%, 21% and 30%, respectively.
2.4 Soil degradation test
Pre-cultured soils were air-dried, smashed and passed through the 2 mm sieve. Then 20 g soil samples were weighed into 250 mL brown conical asks, and 200 mg of racemic carfentrazone-ethyl was added and mixed in Anhui, Jiangxi and Jilin soils. Enantiopure carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone isomers (200 mg) were added into Jilin soil to investigate the chiral stability. Aer then, water was added to adjust the soil water content to 60% of the saturation moisture capacity. The ask was plugged with a ventilation silica gel and then cultured in the dark at 25 C. Triplicate samples were collected at 2, 4, 6, 8 h, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 30 d during the culture. And in the process of the culture, the water content was adjusted timely to maintain the original state. Meanwhile, the blank control group was set.
2.5 Samples extract and clean-up
The carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers in soil were determined according to methods described by Duan et al.22 In short, 10 g soil samples were weighted into a 50 mL Teon centrifuge tubes with plugs. Next, 10 mL of water and 20 mL of acetonitrile were added and the tubes were shaken vigorously for 30 min. Subsequently, 3 g anhydrous magnesium sulphate and 1 g sodium chloride were added and the tubes were oscillated violently for 2 min. The centrifuge tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm. Then, 1.5 mL upper organic

phase was transferred into a 10 mL centrifugal tube containing 50 mg of PSA and 100 mg of anhydrous magnesium sulphate and vortexed for 1 min. The tube was centrifugated at 5000 rpm for 3 min, the supernatant was ltered by a 0.22 mm nylon syringe lter and for UPLC-MS/MS analysis.

solutions were obtained at same concentration by adding appropriate amounts of standards to blank sample extract. The linearity of the calibration curves was evaluated based on the peak areas and concentrations of standard solutions and matrix-matched standard solutions using Microso Excel.

2.6 Chiral separation and detection
The separation potency of three columns (CHIRALPAK AD-3R, CHIRALCEL OD-3R and Super-chiral S-AD-RH) have been investigated in this study. Among those columns only Superchiral S-AD-RH can achieve the simultaneously separation of carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers. So, Superchiral S-AD-RH was chosen for the further degradation experiment. The separation and detection of the carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers were performed by the UPLCMS/MS with a super chiral S-AD column (150 mm Â 4.6 mm). The mixture of a 10 mmol LÀ1 ammonium acetate aqueous solution and methanol (containing 0.1% formic acid) was used as the mobile phase at the ow rate of 0.4 mL minÀ1. The injection volume and column temperature were 5 mL and 35 C, respectively. Gradient elution was adopted and the elution order of four compounds was S-(+)-carfentrazone, R-(À)-carfentrazone, S-(À)-carfentrazone-ethyl and R-(+)-carfentrazoneethyl, respectively22
An electronic spray ion source with positive ion (ESI+) ionization in the MRM mode. The capillary voltage was 4.5 kV. The desolvation tube temperature and the heating module temperature were 250 C and 450 C, respectively. High-purity nitrogen was used as both the atomization gas and the drying gas with the gas ow of 3.0 L hÀ1 and 20 L hÀ1, respectively. The highpurity argon was used as collision gas. The quantitative ion pair of carfentrazone-ethyl was m/z 429.05 > 412.00, and the qualitative ion pair was m/z 429.05 > 346.00 and m/z 429.05 > 366.00. Correspondingly, the quantitative ion pair of carfentrazone was m/z 401.00 > 383.90, while the qualitative ion pair was m/z 401.00 > 365.90 and m/z 401.00 > 345.85.22
2.7 Method validation
2.7.1 Standard curves. Individual standard solutions (1000 mg LÀ1) in methanol of carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomer were diluted to serial concentrations (5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 mg LÀ1) of mixed standard solutions with methanol. Correspondingly, the matrix-matched standard

2.8 Data processing
The degradation rate constant (k) of the carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomer in the soils was calculated using the rst-order kinetic equation. The variation with time of the residual concentration was listed as follows:23
C ¼ C0eÀkt
T1/2 ¼ ln 2/k ¼ 0.693/k
where C0 is the initial concentration of the carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomer in the samples (mg kgÀ1), C is the concentration of the carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomer at t time (mg kgÀ1), k is the degradation rate constant and t is time aer the application of the pesticides. T1/2 is the degradation half-life of the enantiomers.
The enantioselective degradation of carfentrazone-ethyl or the carfentrazone enantiomer was evaluated using the enantiomeric fraction (EF):
EF ¼ (À)-enantiomer/[(À)-enantiomer + (+)-enantiomer]
The EF value was between 0 and 1. When EF ¼ 0.5, the degradation rates of the two enantiomers were same and no enantiomer selectivity. When EF > 0.5, (+)-enantiomer degraded preferentially. When EF < 0.5, (À)-enantiomer degraded faster. The more the EF value deviated from 0.5, the stronger the stereoselectivity behaviour of the carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers in the samples.
3. Results and analysis
3.1 Standard curve and linearity As shown in Table 2, excellent linearity in the range of 5 to 1000 mg LÀ1 for carfentrazone-ethyl and the carfentrazone enantiomers were obtained with correlation coefficients (R2) $ 0.9986. The slope ratio of the solvent calibration curves via matrix-matched calibration curves ranged from 1.01 to 1.20 (Table 2). In general,

signicant suppression or enhancement effects were observed as the slope ratios were $10%. Finally, the matrix-matched standards were utilized for quantication to obtain more realistic results in this work. The LOD and LOQ of carfentrazone-ethyl and the carfentrazone enantiomers in the soils were 0.5-3.0 mg kgÀ1 and 1.7- 10 mg kgÀ1, respectively. The typical LC-MS/MS chromatograms was showed in Fig. 1.

3.2 Stereoselective degradation of carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers in soils
The degradation data of the carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers in Jiangxi soil were showed in Table 3. The degradation of the carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers in the Jiangxi soil followed a rst-order kinetics with R2 ranged from 0.7141 to 0.7160. The carfentrazone-ethyl was fast degraded with the half live of 2.7 d. Simultaneously, the carfentrazone enantiomers was formed with the degradation of carfentrazone-ethyl and reached a maxima of 2.41 mg kgÀ1 1.20 mg kgÀ1 at 8 h in the incubation of carfentrazone-ethyl (Fig. 4). Then, the carfentrazone enantiomers were slowly degraded. There was slight stereoselective degradation for carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers with the EF values ranging from 0.51-0.57 in Jiangxi soil (Fig. 3A) and the R(À)-carfentrazone-ethyl was preferentially degraded.

The stereoselective degradation results of carfentrazoneethyl enantiomers in the Anhui paddy soil were shown in Table 3. The degradation of the carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers was described by a rst-order kinetics equation with R2 $ 0.6175. Same soil as the other two places, the concentration of carfentrazone increased at rst and then decreased with the passage of time (Fig. 4). The half-lives of S-(+)-carfentrazoneethyl and R-(À)-carfentrazone-ethyl were 4.2 d and 4.8 d, respectively. The EF of the carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers was in the range of 0.51 to 0.67, which showed certain stereoselective degradations (Fig. 3A).
In a summary, the order of degradation rates in three kinds of soil was Jiangxi > Jilin > Anhui, and the stereoselectivity in Jilin performed more remarkable. In addition, the formation content of carfentrazone enantiomers was not equal in the incubation of carfentrazone-ethyl and the content of R-(À)-carfentrazone was more than S-enantiomer.

4. Conclusions and discussions

Fig. 3 The EF value of carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers in three kinds of different soils: (A) the EF value of carfentrazone enantiomers in Jiangxi red soil, Jilin black soil and Anhui paddy soil; (B) the EF value of carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers in Jiangxi red soil, Jilin black soil and Anhui paddy soil.
The degradation tendency of enantiopure carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers in Jilin soil indicated that there was no bidirectional chiral inversion occurred. From the representative of Jilin soil, we can notice that the enantioselectivity of carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers was determined by the different degradation rate of enantiomers (Fig. 2).

In this study, a chiral analysis method of carfentrazone-ethyl and its chiral metabolite enantiomers in the soils was established using optimized QuEchERS method and LC-MS/MS.
The carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers were fast degraded in three types of soils with the half-lives ranged from 2.7 d to 4.8 d. Carfentrazone generated very quickly with the degradation of carfentrazone-ethyl. The concentration of carfentrazone stereoisomer increased steadily to a maximum and then decreased slowly. Therefore, the carfentrazone may play a major role to control weeds in agricultural management. The degradation of carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers in the three types of soils possesses signicant stereoselectivity. And carfentrazone enantiomers performed stronger stereoselectivity than carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers. The R-(+)-carfentrazone-ethyl was preferentially degraded in the early period, causing the accumulation of R-(À)-carfentrazone. This interesting phenomenon led to the signicant enantioselectivity of carfentrazone enantiomers. This result may be explained by the predominance of microbial populations or consortia preferentially degrading the R-enantiomer or on the activation/inhibition of enantiomerspecic enzymes.16 The mechanism of the stereoselective degradation behaviour of carfentrazone-ethyl and the carfentrazone enantiomers in the soils need the further research. The data obtained in this study could provide support for environmental risk evaluation of pesticides.

Stereoselective degradation behaviour of carfentrazone-ethyl and its metabolite carfentrazone in soils
Jinsheng Duan,ab Beibei Gao,a Xu Dong,b Mingna Sun,b Yang Shen,b Zhaoxian Zhang,a Tongchun Gaob and Minghua Wang *a
The stereoselective environmental behaviour of carfentrazone-ethyl and its metabolite carfentrazone enantiomer in three types of soil were studied under aerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, significant stereoselective difference in the degradation behaviour of carfentrazone-ethyl and its metabolite carfentrazone enantiomer was observed in Jiangxi red soil, Jilin black soil and Anhui paddy soil. The EF values of the carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers in Anhui paddy soil, Jilin black soil, and Jiangxi red soil were 0.67, 0.65 and 0.57, respectively. The EF values of the carfentrazone enantiomer in the three types of soil were 0.75, 0.80 and 0.76. No bidirectional chiral inversion of enantiopure carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers was observed in Jilin soil. As a result, R(+)-carfentrazone-ethyl and S-(+)-carfentrazone in soil would be preferentially degraded, while S(À)-carfentrazone-ethyl and R-(À)-carfentrazone were enriched. The results found in this paper could provide more scientific guidance for the risk assessments of carfentrazone-ethyl from a chiral perspective.

1. Introduction
Aer application, most chiral pesticides dispersed into air or settle on the soil surface, leaving only a small proportion absorbed by plants. The enantiomers of these chiral pesticides oen exhibit different characteristics during their migration and transformation in living bodies or the environment, such as adsorption, enrichment, transformation, metabolism and degradation.1-5 Soil is an important component of environmental media for the transformation, migration and digestion of pesticide residues.6 Study of the stereoselectivity behavior of chiral pesticides in the environmental media can provide a more accurate environmental risk evaluation.7-15 The complexity of the soil system determines the abundance of chiral factors in it, such as the microbial community structure and the enzyme system. They all constitute the environment for chiral pesticide degradation. Therefore, it is essential to carry out a study on the stereoselectivity of chiral pesticides to investigate pesticide behaviour in the soil environment.3
Through the research on the 20 types of soils, Buerge et al. found that under aerobic conditions, the selective degradation

of metalaxyl in soil is closely related with the soil pH.16 When the soil pH > 5, the R-enantiomer of metalaxyl showed a higher degradation rate. When 4 < pH < 5, the degradation rates of the two enantiomers were roughly equal, and the S-enantiomer was preferentially degraded when pH < 4. Romero et al. discovered that the S-enantiomers of 2-methyl-chlorophenoxypropionic acid and 2,4-D-propionic acid in the sludge and the sandy soil remained for a longer period than the R-enantiomers, but the opposite phenomenon was observed in clay.17 In the three types of soil, the R-enantiomers of the two herbicides could be transformed into the S-enantiomers. Poiger et al. studied the stereoselective degradation of haloxyfop-2-ethoxyethyl in soils and found that haloxyfop-2-ethoxyethyl could transfer to piperoxolinic acid in fresh soils with the passage of time, and the S-enantiomer could transform to the R-enantiomer quickly.18 Sun et al. studied the degradation behaviors of the indoxacarb enantiomers in different types of agricultural eld soil and found that the indoxacarb enantiomers degraded quickly in alkali soil while degraded not so quickly as that in acid soils.19 Moreover, they discussed the effects of the soil organic matter content on the degradation of the indoxacarb enantiomers and concluded that the higher organic matter content could result in a stronger selective degradation behaviour.
Carfentrazone-ethyl is a broad-spectrum, systemic, selective post-emergence triazolone herbicide. Carfentrazone-ethyl inhibit the activity of the protoporphyrin oxidase(PPO) and interfere the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway of plants. It has been widely used to control broadleaf grasses in crop elds,

such as rice, wheat, soybean and corn. To date, the existing studies on the degradation behaviours of carfentrazone-ethyl residues mainly focused on racemes.20,21 As for the studies on the stereoselective degradation behaviours of carfentrazoneethyl and its metabolite carfentrazone still without report.
In this study, a chiral multiresidues analysis method of the chiral carfentrazone-ethyl and its chiral metabolites carfentrazone enantiomers in soils were established on the basis of the optimization of the QuEchERS method and LC MS/MS. The stereoselective degradation behaviors of carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers in different soils were studied for the rst time through an indoor incubation test. The degradation of enantiopure carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone isomers in Jilin soil was used to study the chiral stability. This paper could provide scientic and theoretical references for the environmental risks evaluation of carfentrazone-ethyl.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Reagents and materials
The carfentrazone-ethyl raceme (95% purity) was provided by Institute for the Control of Agrochemicals, Ministry of Agriculture (Beijing, China). R-(+)-Carfentrazone-ethyl, S-(À)-carfentrazone-ethyl, S-(+)-carfentrazone and R-(À)-carfentrazone (>95% purity and >98% optical purity) were prepared by Shanghai Qinlu Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Chromatography grade methanol and acetonitrile were obtained from TEDIA (Faireld, Connecticut, USA). Chromatographically pure ammonium acetate and formic acid were obtained from Aladdin Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The ultra-pure water was Watsons puried water.
The dispersing agents primary secondary amine (PSA) was provided by Bonar Agela Technology Company (Tianjin, China). Analytical grade acetonitrile, anhydrous magnesium sulphate and sodium chloride were obtained from the National Pharmaceutical Chemical Reagent Company (Shanghai, China). Enantioseparation and analyses were performed using an LCMS-8030 ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with Super-chiral S-AD-RH (150 mm Â 4.6 mm, 5 mm) (Shanghai Qinlu Biotech Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China); CHIRALCEL AD-3R (150 mm Â 2.1 mm, 3 mm) (Daicel, Tokyo, Japan) and CHIRALCEL OD-3R(150 mm Â 2.1 mm, 3 mm) (Daicel, Tokyo, Japan). The HC-3018 high-speed centrifuge (Anhui Zhongke Zhongjia Scientic Instrument Co., Ltd. Hefei, China), M3 vortex oscillator (IKA company, Germany), and a nylon lter membrane (0.22 mm, ANPEL Company, USA) were used.

2.2 Soil sample preparation
Three kinds of soils (Jilin black soil, Jiangxi red soil and Anhui paddy soil) representing different physicochemical properties and climatic environments were collected from the 0-10 cm agricultural eld and mixed thoroughly. The soil samples were air-dried and sied by a 2 mm sieve, and then stored in the dark at 4 C. The physicochemical parameters of the three kinds of soils were listed in Table 1.
2.3 Soil pre-culture
Approximately 2 kg of each types of soil samples were precultured at 25 C, respectively. Meanwhile, water was sprayed on the soils to keep the water content at 60% of saturation moisture capacity of the soils. The soils were incubated for 2 weeks at 25 C. During the culture, the water contents of the soils were adjusted timely to maintain the original state. The saturation moisture capacities of the paddy soil in Anhui, red soil in Jiangxi and black soil in Jilin were 23%, 21% and 30%, respectively.
2.4 Soil degradation test
Pre-cultured soils were air-dried, smashed and passed through the 2 mm sieve. Then 20 g soil samples were weighed into 250 mL brown conical asks, and 200 mg of racemic carfentrazone-ethyl was added and mixed in Anhui, Jiangxi and Jilin soils. Enantiopure carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone isomers (200 mg) were added into Jilin soil to investigate the chiral stability. Aer then, water was added to adjust the soil water content to 60% of the saturation moisture capacity. The ask was plugged with a ventilation silica gel and then cultured in the dark at 25 C. Triplicate samples were collected at 2, 4, 6, 8 h, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 30 d during the culture. And in the process of the culture, the water content was adjusted timely to maintain the original state. Meanwhile, the blank control group was set.
2.5 Samples extract and clean-up
The carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers in soil were determined according to methods described by Duan et al.22 In short, 10 g soil samples were weighted into a 50 mL Teon centrifuge tubes with plugs. Next, 10 mL of water and 20 mL of acetonitrile were added and the tubes were shaken vigorously for 30 min. Subsequently, 3 g anhydrous magnesium sulphate and 1 g sodium chloride were added and the tubes were oscillated violently for 2 min. The centrifuge tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm. Then, 1.5 mL upper organic

phase was transferred into a 10 mL centrifugal tube containing 50 mg of PSA and 100 mg of anhydrous magnesium sulphate and vortexed for 1 min. The tube was centrifugated at 5000 rpm for 3 min, the supernatant was ltered by a 0.22 mm nylon syringe lter and for UPLC-MS/MS analysis.

solutions were obtained at same concentration by adding appropriate amounts of standards to blank sample extract. The linearity of the calibration curves was evaluated based on the peak areas and concentrations of standard solutions and matrix-matched standard solutions using Microso Excel.

2.6 Chiral separation and detection
The separation potency of three columns (CHIRALPAK AD-3R, CHIRALCEL OD-3R and Super-chiral S-AD-RH) have been investigated in this study. Among those columns only Superchiral S-AD-RH can achieve the simultaneously separation of carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers. So, Superchiral S-AD-RH was chosen for the further degradation experiment. The separation and detection of the carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers were performed by the UPLCMS/MS with a super chiral S-AD column (150 mm Â 4.6 mm). The mixture of a 10 mmol LÀ1 ammonium acetate aqueous solution and methanol (containing 0.1% formic acid) was used as the mobile phase at the ow rate of 0.4 mL minÀ1. The injection volume and column temperature were 5 mL and 35 C, respectively. Gradient elution was adopted and the elution order of four compounds was S-(+)-carfentrazone, R-(À)-carfentrazone, S-(À)-carfentrazone-ethyl and R-(+)-carfentrazoneethyl, respectively22
An electronic spray ion source with positive ion (ESI+) ionization in the MRM mode. The capillary voltage was 4.5 kV. The desolvation tube temperature and the heating module temperature were 250 C and 450 C, respectively. High-purity nitrogen was used as both the atomization gas and the drying gas with the gas ow of 3.0 L hÀ1 and 20 L hÀ1, respectively. The highpurity argon was used as collision gas. The quantitative ion pair of carfentrazone-ethyl was m/z 429.05 > 412.00, and the qualitative ion pair was m/z 429.05 > 346.00 and m/z 429.05 > 366.00. Correspondingly, the quantitative ion pair of carfentrazone was m/z 401.00 > 383.90, while the qualitative ion pair was m/z 401.00 > 365.90 and m/z 401.00 > 345.85.22
2.7 Method validation
2.7.1 Standard curves. Individual standard solutions (1000 mg LÀ1) in methanol of carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomer were diluted to serial concentrations (5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 mg LÀ1) of mixed standard solutions with methanol. Correspondingly, the matrix-matched standard

2.8 Data processing
The degradation rate constant (k) of the carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomer in the soils was calculated using the rst-order kinetic equation. The variation with time of the residual concentration was listed as follows:23
C ¼ C0eÀkt
T1/2 ¼ ln 2/k ¼ 0.693/k
where C0 is the initial concentration of the carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomer in the samples (mg kgÀ1), C is the concentration of the carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomer at t time (mg kgÀ1), k is the degradation rate constant and t is time aer the application of the pesticides. T1/2 is the degradation half-life of the enantiomers.
The enantioselective degradation of carfentrazone-ethyl or the carfentrazone enantiomer was evaluated using the enantiomeric fraction (EF):
EF ¼ (À)-enantiomer/[(À)-enantiomer + (+)-enantiomer]
The EF value was between 0 and 1. When EF ¼ 0.5, the degradation rates of the two enantiomers were same and no enantiomer selectivity. When EF > 0.5, (+)-enantiomer degraded preferentially. When EF < 0.5, (À)-enantiomer degraded faster. The more the EF value deviated from 0.5, the stronger the stereoselectivity behaviour of the carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers in the samples.
3. Results and analysis
3.1 Standard curve and linearity As shown in Table 2, excellent linearity in the range of 5 to 1000 mg LÀ1 for carfentrazone-ethyl and the carfentrazone enantiomers were obtained with correlation coefficients (R2) $ 0.9986. The slope ratio of the solvent calibration curves via matrix-matched calibration curves ranged from 1.01 to 1.20 (Table 2). In general,

3.2 Stereoselective degradation of carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers in soils
The degradation data of the carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers in Jiangxi soil were showed in Table 3. The degradation of the carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers in the Jiangxi soil followed a rst-order kinetics with R2 ranged from 0.7141 to 0.7160. The carfentrazone-ethyl was fast degraded with the half live of 2.7 d. Simultaneously, the carfentrazone enantiomers was formed with the degradation of carfentrazone-ethyl and reached a maxima of 2.41 mg kgÀ1 1.20 mg kgÀ1 at 8 h in the incubation of carfentrazone-ethyl (Fig. 4). Then, the carfentrazone enantiomers were slowly degraded. There was slight stereoselective degradation for carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers with the EF values ranging from 0.51-0.57 in Jiangxi soil (Fig. 3A) and the R(À)-carfentrazone-ethyl was preferentially degraded.

The stereoselective degradation results of carfentrazoneethyl enantiomers in Jilin black soil was showed in Table 3. The degradation of the carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers in Jilin black soil conformed to the rst-order kinetics with the half life of 4.2 d and 4.1 d, respectively. Over 90% of the carfentrazoneethyl enantiomers were degraded in 1 d. The carfentrazone was also observed in the incubation of carfentrazone-ethyl. The concentration of carfentrazone increased early period and then began to decline aer reached the maximum at 8 h (Fig. 4). There was remarkable stereoselective degradation for carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers with the EF values ranging from 0.52 to 0.65 in Jilin soil (Fig. 3A).

The stereoselective degradation results of carfentrazoneethyl enantiomers in the Anhui paddy soil were shown in Table 3. The degradation of the carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers was described by a rst-order kinetics equation with R2 $ 0.6175. Same soil as the other two places, the concentration of carfentrazone increased at rst and then decreased with the passage of time (Fig. 4). The half-lives of S-(+)-carfentrazoneethyl and R-(À)-carfentrazone-ethyl were 4.2 d and 4.8 d, respectively. The EF of the carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers was in the range of 0.51 to 0.67, which showed certain stereoselective degradations (Fig. 3A).
In a summary, the order of degradation rates in three kinds of soil was Jiangxi > Jilin > Anhui, and the stereoselectivity in Jilin performed more remarkable. In addition, the formation content of carfentrazone enantiomers was not equal in the incubation of carfentrazone-ethyl and the content of R-(À)-carfentrazone was more than S-enantiomer.

4. Conclusions and discussions

Fig. 3 The EF value of carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers in three kinds of different soils: (A) the EF value of carfentrazone enantiomers in Jiangxi red soil, Jilin black soil and Anhui paddy soil; (B) the EF value of carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers in Jiangxi red soil, Jilin black soil and Anhui paddy soil.
The degradation tendency of enantiopure carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers in Jilin soil indicated that there was no bidirectional chiral inversion occurred. From the representative of Jilin soil, we can notice that the enantioselectivity of carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers was determined by the different degradation rate of enantiomers (Fig. 2).

In this study, a chiral analysis method of carfentrazone-ethyl and its chiral metabolite enantiomers in the soils was established using optimized QuEchERS method and LC-MS/MS.
The carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers were fast degraded in three types of soils with the half-lives ranged from 2.7 d to 4.8 d. Carfentrazone generated very quickly with the degradation of carfentrazone-ethyl. The concentration of carfentrazone stereoisomer increased steadily to a maximum and then decreased slowly. Therefore, the carfentrazone may play a major role to control weeds in agricultural management. The degradation of carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers in the three types of soils possesses signicant stereoselectivity. And carfentrazone enantiomers performed stronger stereoselectivity than carfentrazone-ethyl enantiomers. The R-(+)-carfentrazone-ethyl was preferentially degraded in the early period, causing the accumulation of R-(À)-carfentrazone. This interesting phenomenon led to the signicant enantioselectivity of carfentrazone enantiomers. This result may be explained by the predominance of microbial populations or consortia preferentially degrading the R-enantiomer or on the activation/inhibition of enantiomerspecic enzymes.16 The mechanism of the stereoselective degradation behaviour of carfentrazone-ethyl and the carfentrazone enantiomers in the soils need the further research. The data obtained in this study could provide support for environmental risk evaluation of pesticides.

Is repositioning effective for pressure injury prevention in adults? A Cochrane Review summary with commentary

Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul Physical Therapy Rehabilitation Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey Received: November 26, 2021 Accepted: November 30, 2021 Published online: December 01, 2021

The aim of this commentary is to discuss in a rehabilitation perspective relative to the Cochrane Review, "Repositioning for pressure injury prevention in adults" by Gillespie, Walker, Latimer, Thalib, Whitty, McInnes, Chaboyer,[1] published by the Cochrane Wounds Group. This Cochrane Corner is produced in agreement with the Turkish Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation by Cochrane Rehabilitation with views* of the review summary authors in the "implications for practice" section.
Background: Pressure injury (PI) is a serious problem for health care systems, affecting the health of more than 7 million people all around the world.[2] Over 2.5 million people in the US develop PI and 60,000 of them die, similarly in the UK 700,000 people are affected with a result of 29,000 deaths.[3] Pressure injury treatment cost is high. The cost has been calculated as US $10.708 per patient.[4] Pressure injury is observed in 1/10 hospitalized adult patients and most of these wounds are superficial and are preventable.[5] Unless PI is cured, it negatively affects the lives of the elderly and immobile people (e.g., pain, sepsis, QoL, death).[6] In 2014, a pressure ulcer is defined as "a localized injury to the skin or underlying tissue usually over a bony prominence as a result of pressure or pressure in

combination with shear".[7] In 2016, instead of pressure ulcer, the term PI was accepted with a wider range of injuries such as the ones occurring under a medical or another device.[8] For a person with normal physical, mental, and sensory status, prolonged pressure causes pain and discomfort, which leads the person to change his/her body position in order to get rid of the pressure. However, for persons who cannot change their position due to various reasons (age, plegia, sensory defect, etc.), repositioning in certain frequencies is recommended to prevent PI. In the Cochrane Review of 2014, evidence for repositioning frequency and appropriate positioning was found to be insufficient.[9] In a clinical practice guideline published in 2019, "determining repositioning frequency with consideration to the individual's level of activity, mobility and ability to independently reposition" was strongly recommended at the B2 level of evidence, and "using the 30° lateral side-lying position in preference to the 90° side-lying position when positioning" was recommended at C level of evidence.[10] This current Cochrane review is an updated review of evidence on various repositioning regimes to evaluate PI prevention in immobile people without considering the supporting mattress type.

Repositioning for pressure injury prevention in adults

Repositioning for pressure injury prevention in adults (Gillespie et al., 2020)[1]
What is the aim of this Cochrane review?
This review aimed to compare different repositioning frequencies and positioning regimes in adults staying in long-term care settings and hospitals, to determine effective ways to prevent PI.
What was studied in the Cochrane review?
The population addressed in this review was adults without any existing PI who were admitted to healthcare facilities or long-term care settings. The interventions studied were repositioning frequencies and patient positions, regardless of the inclusion of standard clinical care strategies (e.g., type of support surfaces used). The interventions were compared to assess their effect on the incidence of PI. 2-, 3-, 4-hourly repositioning frequencies, as well as positioning relative to 30° recumbent tilt and 90° lateral rotation positioning. Also, repositioning regimes were compared with standard care. The primary outcomes studied were the rates of incidence of PI of any stage. And the secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life which includes author reported utility scores, pain, patient satisfaction, and costs relevant to the prevention, visits to health professionals, and avoidance of PI prevention.
Search methodology and up-to-dateness of the Cochrane review?
The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to February 12, 2019, in electronic databases including the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE and Ovid Embase, EBSCO CINAHL Plus and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database.
Authors also searched clinical trials registries including the National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and the EU Clinical Trials Register, all up to March 10, 2019.
What are the main results of the Cochrane review?
The review included eight randomized controlled studies (RCT and cluster-RCT) involving 3,941 individuals.[11-18] Six studies reported the rate of participants developing PI of any stage. In two of the eight studies, cost evaluations were also reported.

The follow-up period in studies ranged from 24 hours to 28 days. All studies were at high risk of bias.
Incidence of PI according to repositioning frequencies
· In three studies involving 1,074 participants[11-13] 2-hourly and 4 hourly repositioning frequencies were compared regardless of the support surface. The cumulative results of the three studies (pooled analysis) of the repositioning frequencies suggest the certainty of evidence is very low relative to increased or decreased incidence of PI (fixed-effect; I2 = 45%, pooled risk ratio [RR]: 1.06, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.80 to 1.41).
· Comparisons in these studies were not included in the pooled analysis. The comparison of 2-hourly and 3 hourly repositioning frequencies on high-density foam mattresses in one of the trials with 3 arms involving 967 adults showed no clear difference in PI risk (RR: 4.06, 95% CI: 0.87 to 18.98) based on low certainty evidence.[11]
· A possibility of reduction in PI incidence with 3-hourly repositioning frequency was suggested in one of the arms of the same trial when compared with 4-hourly repositioning frequency based on low certainty of evidence (RR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.92)[11] and high risk of bias.
· The comparison of 2-hourly and 3-hourly repositioning frequencies on standard mattresses as well as 4-hourly and 6-hourly repositioning frequencies on viscoelastic foam mattresses revealed an RR of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.69 to 1.16) and an RR of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.53 to 1.02). These comparisons were based on very low certainty evidence in one study involving 262 adults thus their actual effects are unknown.[12]
Incidence of PI according to positioning regimes
Pooled analysis
· Among 4 studies comparing distinct tilt positions, 2 studies involving 252 adults were subject to a meta-analysis which revealed no clear difference when 30° tilt was compared with 90° tilt positioning in terms of the PI stage 1 or 2 incidence/proportion with a RR of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.10 to 3.97) based on very low certainty evidence and downgraded due to serious design limitations and very serious imprecision.[15,16]

Single studies
· In one study (120 participants in three groups) tilts of 30° and 45° were compared with usual care where no PI occurred in any of the adults based on low certainty of evidence.[17]
· In one study (116 participants), prone position and usual supine position was compared with the indication of higher stage 1 PI incidence in the prone position and no clear difference regarding stage 2 PI incidence between groups based on low certainty evidence.[18]
Secondary outcomes for quality of life, pain, and satisfaction
No studies reported the secondary outcomes mentioned above.
Cost analysis
In the two studies reporting cost analysis, the limited data indicates there is no clear evidence about whether the interventions were cost-effective when compared to standard care.
What did the authors conclude about the evidence?
The authors concluded there was insufficient evidence to draw a reliable conclusion. Thus, it is difficult to say whether a different repositioning frequency (2-hourly versus 3-hourly; 4-hourly versus 6-hourly; 2-hourly versus 4-hourly) or a different position (the 30° tilt compared with the 90° lateral position) is more effective than another for preventing PI. High-quality studies with adequate power are required to evaluate the effectiveness of repositioning regimens on PI prevention. For future studies, it is recommended that the number of participants should be larger, different risk groups should be included, up to date technologies and manual methods should be compared in registration, follow-up and care stages, and financial analysis thereof should be made.
What are the implications of the Cochrane evidence for practice in rehabilitation?
The presence of PI is one of the deterrent factors for particularly immobile patients to participate in a rehabilitation program. Treatment of PI takes a long time and increases immobility, thus creating a vicious circle for the patient.[19] Therefore, preventing PI is more important than treating it. This review was able to include only the studies which assessed the effectiveness of repositioning frequencies and regimens on the incidence of PI, for mostly elderly, physically dependent, immobile, long-term cared,

and hospitalized participants. Evidence was judged as low and very low certainty with the implication that the actual effects are not known. Thus, the findings obtained from this review do not provide sufficient evidence to guide rehabilitation professionals on effective methods to prevent PI because of the high level of uncertainty. Furthermore, the population in these studies were not specific to patients commonly treated by rehabilitation professionals (spinal cord injury, geriatric, and traumatic brain injury). For future studies in the prevention of PI, any study focusing on specific risk groups (i.e., spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, geriatric, pediatric, etc.), acute and chronic patient groups, may produce more informative results, depending on how the study is designed and executed. There is also a need for studies to evaluate the effects of PI prevention on QoL, pain and patient satisfaction, not only during the hospitalization period but also in diverse settings including the community.

Introduction: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, and assessment of their cardiac risk is important for preventive strategies. Purpose: The Ministry of Health of Sri Lanka has recommended World Health Organization/ International Society of Hypertension (WHO/ISH) charts for cardiac risk assessment in individuals with T2DM. However, the most suitable cardiac risk assessment tool for Sri Lankans with T2DM has not been studied. This study was designed to evaluate the performance of two cardiac risk assessments tools; WHO/ISH charts and UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk engine. Methods: Cardiac risk assessments were done in 2,432 patients with T2DM attending a diabetes clinic in Southern Sri Lanka using the two risk assessment tools. Validity of two assessment tools was further assessed by their ability to recognize individuals with raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and raised diastolic blood pressure in a cohort of newly diagnosed T2DM patients (n=332). Results: WHO/ISH charts identified 78.4% of subjects as low cardiac risk whereas the UKPDS risk engine categorized 52.3% as low cardiac risk (P,0.001). In the risk categories of 10%-,20%, the UKPDS risk engine identified higher proportions of patients (28%) compared to WHO/ISH charts (7%). Approximately 6% of subjects were classified as low cardiac risk (,10%) by WHO/ISH when UKPDS recognized them as cardiac risk of .20%. Agreement between the two tools was poor ( value =0.144, P,0.01). Approximately 82% of individuals categorized as low cardiac risk by WHO/ISH had higher LDL cholesterol than the therapeutic target of 100 mg/dL. Conclusion: There is a significant discrepancy between the two assessment tools with WHO/ISH risk chart recognizing higher proportions of patients having low cardiac risk than the UKPDS risk engine. Risk assessment by both assessment tools demonstrated poor sensitivity in identifying those with treatable levels of LDL cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).1 They have a considerably higher risk of having CVD compared with age- and sex-matched patients without T2DM.1,2 Due

to the heterogeneous nature of the disease, prevalence and pattern of CVD risk factors vary among individuals with T2DM3 and therefore the risk of developing cardiovascular events such as coronary artery disease and stroke is also different.
Several primary prevention strategies are proven to be effective in reducing future cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM. In particular, lipid-lowering therapy with statin, blood pressure control with antihypertensives, and antiplatelet therapy with aspirin have been shown to be effective in patients with T2DM.4-6 Indications of these primary preventive strategies are decided based on the cardiac risk. For an example, aspirin therapy is recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) for patients with T2DM with a 10-year cardiac risk of 10% or above.6 Although interventions focused on individual CVD risk factors have proven benefits in patients with T2DM, a previous study has shown that adopting total risk approach, in comparison to treatment decisions being based on the level of a single risk factor, could lead to reductions in expenditure.7
Over the past few decades, several risk assessment tools have been developed to estimate the total CVD risk in individuals with T2DM. The Framingham risk score is one of the most widely used risk assessment tools globally. It is based on the findings of the Framingham study conducted predominantly among the Caucasian population.8 The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk engine is another risk assessment tool, which was developed based on data from this study. Unlike other risk assessment tools, the UKPDS risk engine is diabetes-specific and it incorporates glycemia, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and lipid levels as risk factors, in addition to age, sex, ethnic group, smoking status, and time since diagnosis of diabetes.9
Based on the findings of epidemiological surveys on the prevalence and magnitude of CVD risk factors in the South Asian region, the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension (WHO/ISH) has developed a risk assessment tool suitable for use in individuals with diabetes in the region.9,10 These WHO/ISH charts use five parameters that can be measurable at low resource, primary care setting and include sex, age, SBP, smoking status, and serum total cholesterol (TC). Using the WHO/ISH charts, an individual's risk of developing a vascular event during the next 10 years is predicted as a probability.9 However, the major modifiable CVD risk factors in diabetes such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for which therapeutic interventions have shown proven benefits have not been included in the WHO/ISH charts in order

to reduce the cost of its application in the resource poor setting.
The Ministry of Health in Sri Lanka has recommended the use of WHO/ISH charts for screening of individuals in the primary care setting and professional organizations such as the Ceylon College of Physicians, have endorsed this approach. However, the validity of WHO/ISH risk assessment tool in identifying high risk individuals among Sri Lankans with T2DM has not been studied yet.
This study was designed to: 1) estimate the prevalence of CVD risk factors in patients with T2DM, 2) to compare CVD risk estimated by two different tools (WHO/ISH risk prediction charts and UKPDS risk engine), and 3) assess the validity of two risk prediction tools by their ability to detect individuals with raised LDL and DBP based on their cardiac risk.
Methods Study design and sample
This cross sectional study was carried out in a regional diabetes center in Southern Sri Lanka. The sample for this study was selected from a cohort of patients with T2DM who underwent screening at this center during the period from January 2009 to December 2011.
In all study subjects (n=2,432), a pretested intervieweradministered questionnaire was used to obtain demographic and medical information such as age, sex, ethnicity, tobacco smoking, and family history of dyslipidemia. Height was measured to the nearest cm and body weight to the nearest 0.1 kg. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kg divided by height in m2. All anthropometric measurements were performed by trained nurses adhering to the WHO guidelines, using calibrated equipment. Blood pressure was recorded using an electronic instrument (Omron Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), as the mean of two readings taken 5 minutes apart. Blood samples for plasma glucose and lipid profile were collected and plasma glucose was measured using the hexokinase enzymatic method (Cobas analyzer, Roche Diagnostics). Total serum cholesterol was measured using a cholesterol oxidase enzymatic method and direct magnesium/ dextran sulfate method was used to measure high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Friedewald equation was used to calculate LDL cholesterol.
CVD risk factors
Based on the ADA guidelines 2014, dyslipidemia was defined as follows:6 LDL cholesterol levels above 100 mg/dL, triglyceride levels above 150 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol levels

CVD risk assessment in T2DM:WHO/ISH charts vs UKPDS risk engine

below 50 mg/dL in females and below 40 mg/dL in males. In addition, individuals on lipid lowering medications were also considered as having dyslipidemia. Hypertension was defined as SBP 140 mmHg or greater, DBP 90 mmHg or greater, or receiving antihypertensive medication. Obesity was defined as a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or greater.
CVD risk assessment
We used two risk prediction tools namely UKPDS risk engine and WHO/ISH risk prediction charts for South East Asian Region with diabetes mellitus (SEAR B) to assess the prevalence of CVD risk among patients with T2DM over 10 years. Each patient's 10-year CVD risk was classified by both risk assessment tools into one of four risk levels: ,10%, 10%-,20%, 20%-,30%, $30%. The proportion of patients with adverse LDL cholesterol and DBP levels who need therapeutic intervention in the three CVD risk categories of ,30% but .20%, ,20% but .10% and ,10% were then estimated. The cutoff values recommended by the ADA to commence therapeutic interventions for adverse levels of LDL and DBP in subjects with diabetes were used. These include LDL $100 mg/dL and DBP .90 mmHg.
Validity of risk prediction tools
The validity of any risk score depends upon its ability to accurately predict the cardiac risk by identifying individuals with adverse cardiac risk factors. High LDL cholesterol and DBP are important modifiable CVD risk factors, and optimization of these two risk factors have shown to be associated with significantly better outcome. Even though risk prediction tools are designed to predict cardiac risk, the validity of the risk prediction can also be assessed by their ability to recognize high risk individuals with multiple risk factors. As high LDL cholesterol and DBP are not components of both risk prediction tools, ability to detect raised LDL and DBP is used in our study to assess the validity of risk predication tools. For this, we selected a cohort of newly diagnosed patients with T2DM (n=332), aged 20 years or more, free of CVD (stable and unstable angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, coronary artery bypass graft, coronary angioplasty/stenting, and stroke) as ascertained from their clinical records. Sensitivity and specificity of each risk prediction tool to detect raised LDL and DBP needing therapeutic intervention was then assessed.
Ethical consideration
Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Research and Ethics Committee, Faculty of Medicine,

University of Ruhuna, Sri Lanka. Written informed consent was obtained from all the study participants.
Results Baseline characteristics
There were 2,432 patients with T2DM in the sample. Of them, 64% (n=1,566) were males, and mean age of males was 48.3 years (standard deviation [SD] =10.6) and females was 53.6 years (SD =11.5; P=0.001). Males and females were not significantly different in BMI, waist circumference, SBP, DBP, TC, and LDL. Overall, both males and females had relatively high BMI with mean BMI of 24.4 kg/m2 (SD =4.1) and high LDL cholesterol with mean value of 130.3 mg/dL (Table 1).
Of the study subjects, 69% had been on statins (atorvastatin 78%, rosuvastatin 20%, and simvastatin 2%) at the time of recruitment and 64% had been on antihypertensive therapy. The most commonly used antihypertensive medication was angiotensin II receptor blockers (52%) followed by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (36%). In addition, 27% of the study subjects were on aspirin or clopidogrel as a primary preventive strategy.
Prevalence of major CVD risk factors among diabetes patients
Overall prevalence of dyslipidemia with at least one abnormal lipid parameter or statin therapy was seen in 89.3% subjects. Raised LDL cholesterol was the commonest lipid abnormality affecting 84% of subjects. Hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL were comparatively less common, accounting for 19.1% and 17.6% respectively. Hypertension was observed in 69.2% (1,685/2,432) subjects with isolated elevated DBP, accounting for 48.1% (1,171/2,432). Overall, 18.2% subjects were obese; prevalence of obesity in females was 22.2% in comparison to 15.8% in males.
CVD risk categories by two assessment tools
WHO/ISH prediction charts identified 78.4% (1910/2432) of subjects having CVD risk ,10% which was significantly higher when compared to 52.3% (1274/2432) recognized by UKPDS risk engine (P,0.001) (Table 2). However, in the risk categories of 10%-,20%, and 20%-,30%, the UKPDS risk engine identified higher proportions of patients (28% and 6%, respectively) than the WHO/ISH charts (7% and 2%, respectively). An almost similar proportion of sample (1.9% by WHO/ISH risk charts and 2.1% by UKPDS risk engine) was categorized as highest cardiac risk of $30% by both tools (Table 2). The earlier findings revealed a significant

discrepancy of performance between two assessment tools, with UKPDS risk engine recognizing more patients as having higher cardiac risk than WHO/ISH risk charts.
Table 3 shows the comparison of WHO/ISH and UKPDS risk charts in their ability to categorize patients with T2DM into different risk categories. Both tools recognized 56.6% (1,221/2,157) of the sample as having low cardiac risk of ,10%. Interestingly, approximately 6% of subjects who were classified as low cardiac risk by WHO/ISH risk chart were recognized as having high cardiac risk of .20% by UKPDS risk chart. Furthermore, 26% (565/2,157) of patients were classified as having moderate cardiac risk (10%-,20%) by UKPDS risk chart when WHO/ISH categorized them as low cardiac risk (,10%). Agreement between the two tools was poor, especially with higher cardiac risk. Only 13% (7/52) of patients classified as very high cardiac risk (.30%) by UKPDS risk chart were recognized as having the same cardiac risk by WHO/ISH. Vice versa is also correct as only 20% (7/35) of the very high cardiac risk patients recognized by WHO/ISH were recognized as very high cardiac risk by UKPDS. Majority of patients (76.9%) who were originally categorized as very high risk (.30%) by UKPDS would have been classified as low or moderate cardiac risk (,20%) if WHO/ISH risk chart was used as the risk assessment tool.
In order to estimate the degree of agreement between the two risk assessment tools, the kappa value ( value) was calculated (Table 4).  value for agreement for identifying various risk categories by two assessment tools was 0.144 (P,0.01). These findings reveal a significant discrepancy between two assessment tools with UKPDS risk engine, recognizing more patients having higher cardiac risk.

Validity of risk assessment by two methods
The validity of risk prediction of the two risk prediction tools was assessed by their ability to recognize individuals with high LDL cholesterol and DBP in newly diagnosed diabetes patients (n=332).
As shown in Table 5, approximately 82% of individuals had LDL cholesterol more than the therapeutic target of 100 mg/dL in low CVD risk category (risk ,10%) recognized by WHO/ISH. In the same risk category, 14% of individuals had LDL more than 160 mg/dL. Therefore, we can conclude that over 80% of the newly diagnosed diabetes patients would miss out on therapeutic intervention for raised LDL if the therapeutic decision is made solely on the cardiac risk by WHO/ISH alone. Approximately 82% of subjects with low cardiac risk recognized by UKPDS risk engine had raised LDL cholesterol. Thus, both the assessment tools have poor ability to recognize high risk individuals based on the LDL level.
As shown in Table 6, approximately 65% of patients (29/44) with DBP over 90 mmHg were categorized as low cardiac risk (,10%) by WHO/ISH. In comparison, approximately 47% of patients with DBP over 90 mmHg were classified as low cardiac risk by UKPDS risk engine. Thus,

the trend of categorizing patients with high DBP into low cardiac risk category was more frequent with WHO/ISH risk chart than UKPDS risk chart. However at-risk category of 10%-20% WHO/ISH risk chart identified more patients as having high DBP (71%) than UKPDS charts (21%).
The sensitivity and specificity of WHO/ISH and UKPDS risk charts at threshold level of cardiac risk $10% in detecting the levels of DBP needing therapeutic intervention were 34%, 98% and 52%, 79%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of WHO/ISH and UKPDS risk charts at the same risk threshold in recognizing LDL (.100) needing therapeutic intervention were 8%, 96% and 11%, 89%, respectively. The UKPDS risk engine had better sensitivity and almost equal specificity in recognizing adverse DBP and LDL levels.

Discussion
This study evaluated CVD risk in a cohort of patients with T2DM in Sri Lanka using two different risk assessment tools, the WHO/ISH and the UKPDS risk charts. WHO/ISH risk chart has been recommended for cardiac risk assessment for Sri Lankans with T2DM, and the UKPDS risk charts are used exclusively for diabetes patients worldwide.9 A previous study has shown that the different risk scores have variable accuracy in identifying at-risk individuals in different populations.11 This could be due to higher CVD risk in some ethnic groups such as Indians.12 This is the first study comparing two commonly used cardiac assessment tools in a cohort of patients with diabetes in Sri Lanka.
This study shows that WHO/ISH risk chart classified higher proportions (78.4%) of patients into low cardiac risk category (,10%) than the UKPDS risk engine (52.3%). However, at high risk threshold of $30%, both methods were comparable and identified similar proportion of patients (1.9% vs 2.1%). This trend of classifying more patients into low cardiac risk by WHO/ISH is consistent with other studies where WHO/ISH risk chart categorized a higher proportion into low cardiac risk than the other assessment tools used.13-15 Furthermore, there was evidence that WHO/ISH risk chart had very poor CVD risk prediction ability when applied to a cohort of Indian patients with myocardial infarction.16 Results of our study as well as the previous studies might indicate that the WHO/ISH chart underestimates the real cardiac risk.
However, what is unusual in this study is that WHO/ISH categorized comparatively more patients (78% of sample) into low cardiac risk. The cardiac risk observed in our study was more or less similar to the risk observed for the general population. A study done by Ndindjock et al showed that 89% individuals in the general community, of which 16% were diabetic, had low cardiac risk with WHO/ISH risk prediction

chart.7 CVD risk classification using WHO/ISH risk chart in Malaysia revealed that 93% of the general population, of which 13.5% had diabetes, were in low risk category.17 There could be many reasons for the observed low cardiac risk in our cohort of diabetes patients. One reason could be the poor ability of WHO/ISH risk chart to recognize high risk individuals adequately, hence labeling them as low cardiac risk. But the most likely reason could be "treatment effect" as the antihypertensive and statin therapies alter the SBP and the TC, which are two components of the WHO/ ISH risk chart.
There was a significant discrepancy between the two assessment tools in predicting cardiac risk comparing the predictive performance of the WHO/ISH chart and the UKPDS risk engine report's conflicting results.13,14,18 There is evidence that the UKPDS risk engine overestimates the cardiac risk in Caucasians with T2DM.19 However, there is insufficient evidence to show the same phenomenon in people of South Asian origin. One previous study had shown that the UKPDS risk chart recognized a higher percentage of patients of Indian origin as high risk than the other ethnic groups.16 This might indicate that the UKPDS risk chart "behaves" differently among people of South Asian origin. As the UKPDS risk engine has not been validated for South Asians, there is still a possibility that risk prediction by UKPDS risk engine observed in our study may be far from the real cardiac risk.
As the risk levels recognized by two risk assessment tools in a large cohort of patients with long-standing T2DM were quite different, the sensitivity and specificity in detecting raised LDL and DBP in a cohort of newly diagnosed patients with T2DM were then measured. We selected the newly diagnosed patients with T2DM to evade the treatment effect. The ability of WHO/ISH risk assessment tool in detecting raised LDL and DBP was poor, and over 80% of the newly diagnosed diabetes patients would miss out on therapeutic intervention of LDL control if the treatment decision is on the basis of the cardiac risk assessed by WHO/ISH risk chart. This raises an important question of the validity of WHO/ ISH risk stratification in the primary care setting recommended by the Ministry of Health of Sri Lanka. Performance of UKPDS risk engine was also not different to WHO/ISH risk chart in recognizing patients with raised LDL and DBP. Thus, both risk scores have a poor ability to recognize high risk individuals with raised LDL and DBP.
A similar finding was observed in a population-based study conducted in three developing countries using the

WHO/ISH risk chart and it revealed that 30% of patients with treatable blood pressure were missed with risk calculation by the WHO/ISH risk charts.17 The cost effectiveness of the total risk approach at the low resource setting to estimate cardiac risk at population level should be appreciated, but the underestimation of those with treatable risk factors at an individual level is an important issue.
The observed poor sensitivity of risk stratification to detect raised LDL and DBP particularly with the WHO/ISH risk chart in the local setting could also be due to a variation of the CVD risk factor profiles in Sri Lankans with T2DM. It is possible that Sri Lankan patients with T2DM have higher LDL and DBP with normal SBP and TC levels, thus evading classification into high risk categories by assessment tools, which do not consider LDL and DBP levels in its calculation.
Conclusion
There was a significant discrepancy between the two assessment tools in predicting cardiac risk among patients with T2DM in our study. The UKPDS risk engine classified more patients into higher cardiac risk than the WHO/ISH risk chart. Total risk calculation with WHO/ISH and UKPDS risk models demonstrated poor sensitivity as a screening tool to identify individuals with treatable levels of LDL cholesterol and DBP at all risk cutoff levels. There is a need for not only a cost effective but more sensitive risk assessment tool to screen individuals with diabetes and high CVD risk in the Sri Lankan community.

Purpose: The Upper Limb Physician's Rating Scale (ULPRS) is a tool that assesses movement quality of the upper limbs. It is used as an outcome measure after botulinum toxin type A injection in children with cerebral palsy (CP). This study aimed to investigate the reliability and validity of the ULPRS in children with spastic CP. Materials and Methods: Thirty children with spastic CP (M:F=17:13) aged 5 to 13 years old were recruited. The ULPRS was scored based on recorded videotapes by four physicians on two separate occasions. The Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function (MUUL) was scored by an occupational therapist. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), 95% confidence intervals and weighted kappa statistics were calculated for the scores of ULPRS to obtain interrater and intrarater reliability. The relationship between ULPRS and MUUL was assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients. Results: The ICCs for the total ULPRS scores were 0.94 between raters and 0.99 to 1.00 within raters. The weighted kappa statistics for subitem scores for the ULPRS ranged from 0.67 to 1.00 within raters and from 0.46 to 0.86 between raters. The relationship between ULPRS and MUUL was strong (Pearson correlation coefficient=0.751; p<0.05). Conclusion: The results demonstrated the high reliability of the total ULPRS score within and between raters. A significant concurrent validity between ULPRS and MUUL also supports the clinical utility of the ULPRS as an outcome measure of spastic upper limb in children with CP.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common neurologic disorder that causes chronic motor disability in children.1 The majority of CP cases are of the spastic type, and the upper limb is commonly involved. Spasticity has been considered a main contributor to both impairment of function and the development of deformity. Thus, reduction of spasticity plays an important role in managing children with spastic CP. Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) injection into spastic upper limb muscles has been widely used as an adjunct to conventional therapeutic techniques as a means of reducing muscle spasticity and improving function in the affected arm.2 A reduction of muscle

tone, changes in movement pattern, and also an improvement in upper limb function following BoNT-A injection has been described using various outcome measures.3-7
The Upper Limb Physician's Rating Scale (ULPRS) is a semi-quantitative modification of the Lower Limb Physician's Rating Scale. It was designed to assess changes in the movement pattern, focusing on all 3 levels of the arm (palm, forearm, and elbow) to determine whether there is an isolated functional impairment, such as thumb in palm, restricted forearm supination, or a total flexion pattern with thumb in palm, wrist in flexion, forearm supinated, and elbow flexed (Supplementary Table 1, only online).2,8,9
The ULPRS has been recommended by previous studies as an outcome measure to assess functional measures and changes in the movement pattern following BoNT-A injection.2,8,10 The merits of ULPRS are its ease of use in measuring spasticity and speed of assessment by a variety of health care providers without special training. Thus, it may be suitable as an outcome measure for periodic assessments in a busy office setting. However, the reliability and validity of ULPRS have not yet been investigated.
The Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function (MUUL) is a reliable and valid tool for measuring the quality of upper limb movement in children aged 5 to 15 years with cerebral palsy.11,12 It is widely used to examine the effectiveness of specific therapeutic interventions. In addition, it was considered the best measure of unimanual capacity in a systematic review article.13 However, to our knowledge, there is no information about the relationship between ULPRS and MUUL. We hypothesized that the ULPRS would be a reliable clinical test for assessing upper limb function in children with CP. Therefore, the aims of this study were: 1) to evaluate the intrarater and interrater reli-

ability of the ULPRS in children with spastic cerebral palsy and 2) to examine the concurrent validity of the ULPRS by investigating its relationship with the MUUL.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants Thirty children with spastic CP (M:F=17:13) were recruited. The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) is widely used to assess the gross motor function in children with CP, and the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) was developed to evaluate a child's typical manual performance in daily life.14,15 GMFCS and MACS levels of the participants and the distributions of sex, age, and involvement are shown in Table 1.
Ethical approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee of Severance Hospital (#42012-0265). Because all of the children in this study were younger than 18 years, informed consent was obtained from the parents of the children for their participation in the study.
Measurements All of the children were videotaped so that physicians could assess the ULPRS of the upper arm while specific tasks were performed. One physician gave instructions and demonstrated the movements while the other physician recorded the videotape. The scoring of the ULPRS from the videotape was completed by 4 physicians on 2 separate occasions with a time interval of at least one week. The score sheet includes 9 items, and 3-, 4-, and 5-point scales are used to score each component of movement tested.
The MUUL for the affected or more severely affected upper limb was scored by one occupational therapist.
Statistical analysis Missing values on items scores were handled in the analysis as follows: 1) for single-item summaries of reliability, participants with missing values were omitted, and 2) for analysis based on total scores, mean substitution was used so that for each child, their total score was equal to the average on the non-missing items rescaled to the total number of items recorded.
The intrarater and interrater reliability of the total ULPRS scores were examined using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs, based on a two-way random effects model with absolute agreement). To calculate interrater and intrarater re-

liability of the subitems of the ULPRS (ordinal data), we used linearly weighted kappa statistics. ICCs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using SPSS software 19.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The goal of this analysis was to describe the relative homogeneity of the scores with data sets16 and to indicate the degree of agreement between ratings provided by multiple raters.17 Measures from trials 1 and 2 for each rater were compared to determine intrarater reliability. Trial 1 for each rater was used to assess interrater reliability. To further examine reliability, the correlation coefficients were used to calculate the standard error of measurement (SEM), which was calculated on the basis of inter-value differences and standard deviation. The SEMs were calculated for the ULPRS by using the following formula: SEM%=SD·(1-ICC)×(1/mean)× 100.17 The consistency of measurements between occasions for the total ULPRS score for each physician was examined using the method of Bland and Altman.18
Interpretation of the ICCs was as follows: values above 0.80 were considered very high, between 0.60 and 0.79 were moderately high, between 0.40 and 0.59 were moderate, and less than 0.40 were low.19 There were no absolute criteria for acceptable reliability; however, ICCs greater than 0.7 were considered reliable for sample-based research.20
According to the guidelines of Landis and Koch,21 kappa values of more than 0.80 were considered excellent, between 0.61 and 0.80 were substantial, between 0.40 and 0.60 were moderate, and less than 0.40 were poor to fair.
To examine the concurrent validity of ULPRS, the relationship between the total ULPRS and MUUL scores was tested using the Pearson correlation coefficient.
RESULTS
The mean ULPRS scores performed by four physicians on two different occasions, the ULPRS score at each reading and the mean score for the MUUL are listed in Table 2. There were no missing values among the data.
The ICCs for the total ULPRS scores were 0.94 between raters and 0.99 to 1.00 within raters, indicating very high

interrater and intrarater reliability (Table 3). The weighted kappa statistics for ULPRS subitem scores
ranged from 0.67 to 1.00 within raters. The k values for intrarater reliability were excellent except for subitems of finger opening, thumb in palm, and associated increase in muscle tone for Rater 3, and active supination in flexion and extension for Rater 4. On the other hand, weighted kappa statistics for subitems of ULPRS ranged from 0.46 to 0.86 between raters. The k values between raters were excellent for only 1 subitem and substantial for 4 ULPRS subitems (Table 4). Fig. 1 displays the differences in the total ULPRS scores between occasions for each rater. The means and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) between occasions were 0.03±1.54 for Rater 1, -0.03±3.37 for Rater 2, -0.13±2.79 for Rater 3, and 0.03±1.54 for Rater 4. As shown in Fig. 1, there were no obvious outliers.
The relationship between the ULPRS and MUUL was strong (Pearson correlation coefficient=0.751; p<0.05).

children with CP, such as the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST),22 the MUUL,11 the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA)23 and the Shriners Hospital Upper Extremity Evaluation (SHUEE),24 which differ in terms of which aspect of upper limb function and which age range they target. Therefore, clinicians may select an upper limb measurement tool to assess a specific aspect of upper limb function. The reliability and validity of an assessment tool is important in effectively measuring the outcomes of a specific therapeutic intervention. In addition, convenience and ease

of administration are crucial for periodic assessments. The ULPRS is a simple tool for assessing the quality of movement and function that can be performed by a variety of health care providers, and its ease of application can be useful in a busy clinical setting. In our study, the ICCs of the total ULPRS score were over 0.9 for both intrarater and interrater reliability, which indicates strong reliability of the total ULPRS score. As far as we know, this is the first study to investigate the reliability of the ULPRS. The ICCs for interrater and intrarater reliability of the total ULPRS score in

our study are compatible with those of QUEST and MUUL in the literature, which are commonly used to assess upper arm function for children with CP.11,22,25
As for the intrarater reliability of the ULPRS item scores, the weighted kappa statistics were overall excellent except for 3 subitems for Rater 3 and 2 subitems for Rater 4. On the other hand, the interrater reliability for ULPRS subitems varied from excellent to moderate agreement. In addition, there were no obvious outliers on the Bland-Altman plot, which was narrow. The LOA indicated that the agreement was strong, with the 95% LOA range within ±3.37 on a 47-point scale. These findings suggest that differences in the ULPRS of more than 3.37 after intervention when performed by the same rater may reflect a true change in function as a result of therapeutic intervention.
The ICCs for each item of the ULPRS are in accordance with the reliability of each score on the MUUL in previous studies, where the ICCs varied from low to high (ranging from 0.37 to 0.91).26,27 Some reports demonstrated that the reliability of the scores on each item of the MUUL were acceptable for all items except items 1 and 2.11,26 In contrast, only 9 of 16 items of the MUUL achieved ICCs over 0.7 in Spirtos, et al.'s27 report. Although the reason for this significant difference was not clear, differences in the severity of the subjects' cerebral palsy have been suggested as a possible reason in the Spirtos study. In our study, the weighted kappa statistics for only 4 of 9 items were greater than 0.7. The elbow flexors, pronators, and wrist flexors are commonly targeted for spastic upper limb management with BoNT-A injection,10 and thus, our results indicate that changes in movement patterns after BoNT-A injection into those muscles may be reliably measured with the ULPRS. However, ICCs for the five remaining items on the ULPRS were not adequate for clinical use; therefore, scoring guidelines for clarifying differences between individual scoring criteria are needed.
The MUUL is based on 16 items comprising of tasks that are representative of the most important components of unilateral upper limb function (reach, grasp, release, and manipulation).28 The test is administered by a therapist, with a video recording of the child's performance obtained for subsequent scoring. The reliability and validity of the MUUL has been well-established in previous studies.12,26,27 According to a recent systematic review article, MUUL is the best scale to measure unimanual functional changes as a result of spasticity management.13 Therefore, the validity of the ULPRS was assessed in relation to the MUUL. The signifi-

cant positive correlation between total ULPRS and MUUL scores in our study indicates that the two scales may be comparable.
According to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), upper limb function can be measured based on body impairment, activity, and participation levels. The MUUL is a tool for assessing the activity level of ICF, whereas the ULPRS has components representing impairment levels of ICF in addition to activity levels. Differences in the way components of ICF were measured may have contributed to the weaker relationship between the ULPRS and MUUL.
Changes in movement pattern and quality after BoNT-A injection are of interest to clinicians involved in the management of spastic upper limbs. From this perspective, the ULPRS may have unique clinical value and thus is often used as an outcome measure following BoNT-A injection in the literature.2,8,10 The acceptable reliability, reproducibility, and also validity of the ULPRS demonstrated in our study support the clinical use of the ULPRS as an upper arm measure for children with spastic CP following BoNT-A injection into spastic upper limb muscles.
Videotaped evaluation of upper extremity function has several advantages as well as certain disadvantages. One advantage is the ability to observe the same performance several times to capture movement quality more accurately. On the other hand, the procedure is time-consuming, and scoring from video clips using the ULPRS may be difficult depending on the angle of the video. Therefore, intrarater and interrater reliability from videotaped performances of upper extremity function in children with CP may differ from reliability measured live. Comparison of reliability between live and video observation is needed.
In addition, the ULPRS originally aimed to measure postintervention changes; however, therapeutic interventions were not involved in our study, the effectiveness of the ULPRS in this situation was not examined. Further study is needed to demonstrate the validity of measuring post-intervention changes.
Our study demonstrated high ICC values within and between raters for the total ULPRS score and also a strong relationship between the ULPRS and MUUL. These findings support the clinical utility of ULPRS as an outcome measure after spastic management of the upper limb. However, k values for subitem scores within and between raters varied from excellent to moderate agreements. Further efforts are required to provide scoring guidelines that clarify the differ-

ences between individual scoring criteria for the scores of each item.

Although physical activity (PA) is a key element in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes, many with this chronic disease do not become or remain regularly active. High-quality studies establishing the importance of exercise and fitness in diabetes were lacking until recently, but it is now well established that participation in regular PA improves blood glucose control and can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes, along with positively affecting lipids, blood pressure, cardiovascular events, mortality, and quality of life. Structured interventions combining PA and modest weight loss have been shown to lower type 2 diabetes risk by up to 58% in high-risk populations. Most benefits of PA on diabetes management are realized through acute and chronic improvements in insulin action, accomplished with both aerobic and resistance training. The benefits of physical training are discussed, along with recommendations for varying activities, PA-associated blood glucose management, diabetes prevention, gestational diabetes mellitus, and safe and effective practices for PA with diabetes-related complications.

INTRODUCTION

D iabetes has become a widespread epidemic, primarily because of the increasing prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2007, almost 24 million Americans had diabetes, with one-quarter of those, or six million, undiagnosed (261). Currently, it is estimated that almost 60 million U.S. residents also have prediabe-

tes, a condition in which blood glucose (BG) levels are above normal, thus greatly increasing their risk for type 2 diabetes (261). Lifetime risk estimates suggest that one in three Americans born in 2000 or later will develop diabetes, but in highrisk ethnic populations, closer to 50% may develop it (200). Type 2 diabetes is a significant cause of premature mortality and morbidity related to cardiovascular

disease (CVD), blindness, kidney and nerve disease, and amputation (261). Although regular physical activity (PA) may prevent or delay diabetes and its complications (10,46,89,112,176,208,259,294), most people with type 2 diabetes are not active (193).
In this article, the broader term "physical activity" (defined as "bodily movement produced by the contraction of skeletal muscle that substantially increases energy expenditure") is used interchangeably with "exercise," which is defined as "a subset of PA done with the intention of developing physical fitness (i.e., cardiovascular [CV], strength, and flexibility training)." The intent is to recognize that many types of physical movement may have a positive effect on physical fitness, morbidity, and mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes.
Diagnosis, classification, and etiology of diabetes Currently, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends the use of any of the following four criteria for diagnosing diabetes: 1) glycated hemoglobin (A1C) value of 6.5% or higher, 2) fasting plasma glucose 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/ l), 3) 2-h plasma glucose 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) during an oral glucose tolerance test using 75 g of glucose, and/or 4) classic symptoms of hyperglycemia (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss) or hyperglycemic crisis with a random plasma glucose of 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) or higher. In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, the first three criteria should be confirmed by repeat testing (4). Prediabetes is diagnosed with an A1C of 5.7- 6.4%, fasting plasma glucose of 100 -125 mg/dl (5.6 - 6.9 mmol/l; i.e., impaired fasting glucose [IFG]), or 2-h postload glucose of 140 - 199 mg/dl (7.8 -11.0 mmol/l; i.e., impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) (4).
The major forms of diabetes can be categorized as type 1 or type 2 (4). In type 1 diabetes, which accounts for 5-10% of cases, the cause is an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion resulting from autoimmune destruction of the insulinproducing cells in the pancreas. Type 2

Exercise and type 2 diabetes

diabetes (90 -95% of cases) results from a combination of the inability of muscle cells to respond to insulin properly (insulin resistance) and inadequate compensatory insulin secretion. Less common forms include gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which is associated with a 40 - 60% chance of developing type 2 diabetes in the next 5-10 years (261). Diabetes can also result from genetic defects in insulin action, pancreatic disease, surgery, infections, and drugs or chemicals (4,261).
Genetic and environmental factors are strongly implicated in the development of type 2 diabetes. The exact genetic defects are complex and not clearly defined (4), but risk increases with age, obesity, and physical inactivity. Type 2 diabetes occurs more frequently in populations with hypertension or dyslipidemia, women with previous GDM, and non-Caucasian people including Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanic/ Latinos, Asians, and Pacific Islanders.
Treatment goals in type 2 diabetes The goal of treatment in type 2 diabetes is to achieve and maintain optimal BG, lipid, and blood pressure (BP) levels to prevent or delay chronic complications of diabetes (5). Many people with type 2 diabetes can achieve BG control by following a nutritious meal plan and exercise program, losing excess weight, implementing necessary self-care behaviors, and taking oral medications, although others may need supplemental insulin (261). Diet and PA are central to the management and prevention of type 2 diabetes because they help treat the associated glucose, lipid, BP control abnormalities, as well as aid in weight loss and maintenance. When medications are used to control type 2 diabetes, they should augment lifestyle improvements, not replace them.
ACUTE EFFECTS OF EXERCISE
Fuel metabolism during exercise Fuel mobilization, glucose production, and muscle glycogenolysis. The maintenance of normal BG at rest and during exercise depends largely on the coordination and integration of the sympathetic nervous and endocrine systems (250). Contracting muscles increase uptake of BG, although BG levels are usually maintained by glucose production via liver glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and

mobilization of alternate fuels, such as free fatty acids (FFAs) (250,268).
Several factors influence exercise fuel use, but the most important are the intensity and duration of PA (9,29,47,83,111, 133,160,181,241). Any activity causes a shift from predominant reliance on FFA at rest to a blend of fat, glucose, and muscle glycogen, with a small contribution from amino acids (15,31). With increasing exercise intensity, there is a greater reliance on carbohydrate as long as sufficient amounts are available in muscle or blood (21,23,47,133). Early in exercise, glycogen provides the bulk of the fuel for working muscles. As glycogen stores become depleted, muscles increase their uptake and use of circulating BG, along with FFA released from adipose tissue (15,132, 271). Intramuscular lipid stores are more readily used during longer-duration activities and recovery (23,223,270). Glucose production also shifts from hepatic glycogenolysis to enhanced gluconeogenesis as duration increases (250,268). Evidence statement. PA causes increased glucose uptake into active muscles balanced by hepatic glucose production, with a greater reliance on carbohydrate to fuel muscular activity as intensity increases. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) evidence category A (see Tables 1 and 2 for explanation). Insulin-independent and insulindependent muscle glucose uptake during exercise. There are two well-defined pathways that stimulate glucose uptake by muscle (96). At rest and postprandially, its uptake by muscle is insulin dependent and serves primarily to replenish muscle glycogen stores. During exercise, contractions increase BG uptake to supplement intramuscular glycogenolysis (220,227). As the two pathways are distinct, BG uptake into working muscle is normal even when insulin-mediated uptake is impaired in type 2 diabetes (28,47,293). Muscular BG uptake remains elevated postexercise, with the contraction-mediated pathway persisting for several hours (86,119) and insulinmediated uptake for longer (9,33,141, 226).
Glucose transport into skeletal muscle is accomplished via GLUT proteins, with GLUT4 being the main isoform in muscle modulated by both insulin and contractions (110,138). Insulin activates GLUT4 translocation through a complex signaling cascade (256,293). Contractions, however, trigger GLUT4 translocation at least in part through activation of

5-AMP-activated protein kinase (198,293). Insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation is generally impaired in type 2 diabetes (96). Both aerobic and resistance exercises increase GLUT4 abundance and BG uptake, even in the presence of type 2 diabetes (39,51,204,270). Evidence statement. Insulin-stimulated BG uptake into skeletal muscle predominates at rest and is impaired in type 2 diabetes, while muscular contractions stimulate BG transport via a separate additive mechanism not impaired by insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes. ACSM evidence category A.
Postexercise glycemic control/BG levels Aerobic exercise effects. During moderate-intensity exercise in nondiabetic persons, the rise in peripheral glucose uptake is matched by an equal rise in hepatic glucose production, the result being that BG does not change except during prolonged, glycogen-depleting exercise. In individuals with type 2 diabetes performing moderate exercise, BG utilization by muscles usually rises more than hepatic glucose production, and BG levels tend to decline (191). Plasma insulin levels normally fall, however, making the risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia in anyone not taking insulin or insulin secretagogues very minimal, even with prolonged PA (152). The effects of a single bout of aerobic exercise on insulin action vary with duration, intensity, and subsequent diet; a single session increases insulin action and glucose tolerance for more than 24 h but less than 72 h (26,33,85,141). The effects of moderate aerobic exercise are similar whether the PA is performed in a single session or multiple bouts with the same total duration (14).
During brief, intense aerobic exercise, plasma catecholamine levels rise markedly, driving a major increase in glucose production (184). Hyperglycemia can result from such activity and persist for up to 1-2 h, likely because plasma catecholamine levels and glucose production do not return to normal immediately with cessation of the activity (184). Evidence statement. Although moderate aerobic exercise improves BG and insulin action acutely, the risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia is minimal without use of exogenous insulin or insulin secretagogues. Transient hyperglycemia can follow intense PA. ACSM evidence category C.

Resistance exercise effects. The acute effects of a single bout of resistance training on BG levels and/or insulin action in individuals with type 2 diabetes have not been reported. In individuals with IFG (BG levels of 100 -125 mg/dl), resistance exercise results in lower fasting BG levels 24 h after exercise, with greater reductions in response to both volume (multiple- vs. single-set sessions) and intensity of resistance exercise (vigorous compared with moderate) (18). Evidence statement. The acute effects of resistance exercise in type 2 diabetes have not been reported, but result in lower fasting BG levels for at least 24 h after exercise in individuals with IFG. ACSM evidence category C. Combined aerobic and resistance and other types of training. A combination of aerobic and resistance training may be more effective for BG management than either type of exercise alone (51,238).

Any increase in muscle mass that may result from resistance training could contribute to BG uptake without altering the muscle's intrinsic capacity to respond to insulin, whereas aerobic exercise enhances its uptake via a greater insulin action, independent of changes in muscle mass or aerobic capacity (51). However, all reported combination training had a greater total duration of exercise and caloric use than when each type of training was undertaken alone (51,183,238). Mild-intensity exercises such as tai chi and yoga have also been investigated for their potential to improve BG management, with mixed results (98,117,159, 257,269,286,291). Although tai chi may lead to short-term improvements in BG levels, effects from long-term training (i.e., 16 weeks) do not seem to last 72 h after the last session (257). Some studies have shown lower overall BG levels with extended participation in such activities

(286,291), although others have not (159,257). One study suggested that yoga's benefits on fasting BG, lipids, oxidative stress markers, and antioxidant status are at least equivalent to more conventional forms of PA (98). However, a metaanalysis of yoga studies stated that the limitations characterizing most studies, such as small sample size and varying forms of yoga, preclude drawing firm conclusions about benefits to diabetes management (117). Evidence statement. A combination of aerobic and resistance exercise training may be more effective in improving BG control than either alone; however, more studies are needed to determine if total caloric expenditure, exercise duration, or exercise mode is responsible. ACSM evidence category B. Milder forms of exercise (e.g., tai chi, yoga) have shown mixed results. ACSM evidence category C.

· PA causes increased glucose uptake into active muscles balanced by hepatic glucose production, with a greater reliance on carbohydrate to fuel muscular activity as intensity increases.
· Insulin-stimulated BG uptake into skeletal muscle predominates at rest and is impaired in type 2 diabetes, while muscular contractions stimulate BG transport via a separate, additive mechanism not impaired by insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes.
· Although moderate aerobic exercise improves BG and insulin action acutely, the risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia is minimal without use of exogenous insulin or insulin secretagogues. Transient hyperglycemia can follow intense PA.
· The acute effects of resistance exercise in type 2 diabetes have not been reported, but result in lower fasting BG levels for at least 24 h postexercise in individuals with IFG.
· A combination of aerobic and resistance exercise training may be more effective in improving BG control than either alone; however, more studies are needed to determine whether total caloric expenditure, exercise duration, or exercise mode is responsible.
· Milder forms of exercise (e.g., tai chi, yoga) have shown mixed results. · PA can result in acute improvements in systemic insulin action lasting from 2 to 72 h. · Both aerobic and resistance training improve insulin action, BG control, and fat
oxidation and storage in muscle. · Resistance exercise enhances skeletal muscle mass. · Blood lipid responses to training are mixed but may result in a small reduction in LDL
cholesterol with no change in HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. Combined weight loss and PA may be more effective than aerobic exercise training alone on lipids. · Aerobic training may slightly reduce systolic BP, but reductions in diastolic BP are less common, in individuals with type 2 diabetes. · Observational studies suggest that greater PA and fitness are associated with a lower risk of all-cause and CV mortality. · Recommended levels of PA may help produce weight loss. However, up to 60 min/day may be required when relying on exercise alone for weight loss. · Individuals with type 2 diabetes engaged in supervised training exhibit greater compliance and BG control than those undertaking exercise training without supervision. · Increased PA and physical fitness can reduce symptoms of depression and improve health-related QOL in those with type 2 diabetes. · At least 2.5 h/week of moderate to vigorous PA should be undertaken as part of lifestyle changes to prevent type 2 diabetes onset in high-risk adults. · Epidemiological studies suggest that higher levels of PA may reduce risk of developing GDM during pregnancy. · RCTs suggest that moderate exercise may lower maternal BG levels in GDM. · Before undertaking exercise more intense than brisk walking, sedentary persons with type 2 diabetes will likely benefit from an evaluation by a physician. ECG exercise stress testing for asymptomatic individuals at low risk of CAD is not recommended but may be indicated for higher risk. · Persons with type 2 diabetes should undertake at least 150 min/week of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise spread out during at least 3 days during the week, with no more than 2 consecutive days between bouts of aerobic activity. · In addition to aerobic training, persons with type 2 diabetes should undertake moderate to vigorous resistance training at least 2-3 days/week. · Supervised and combined aerobic and resistance training may confer additional health benefits, although milder forms of PA (such as yoga) have shown mixed results. Persons with type 2 diabetes are encouraged to increase their total daily unstructured PA. Flexibility training may be included but should not be undertaken in place of other recommended types of PA.

Exercise with nonoptimal BG control
Medication effects on exercise responses

Adoption and maintenance of exercise by persons with diabetes

· Individuals with type 2 diabetes may engage in PA, using caution when exercising with BG levels exceeding 300 mg/dl (16.7 mmol/l) without ketosis, provided they are feeling well and are adequately hydrated.
· Persons with type 2 diabetes not using insulin or insulin secretagogues are unlikely to experience hypoglycemia related to PA. Users of insulin and insulin secretagogues are advised to supplement with carbohydrate as needed to prevent hypoglycemia during and after exercise.
· Medication dosage adjustments to prevent exercise-associated hypoglycemia may be required by individuals using insulin or certain insulin secretagogues. Most other medications prescribed for concomitant health problems do not affect exercise, with the exception of -blockers, some diuretics, and statins.
· Known CVD is not an absolute contraindication to exercise. Individuals with angina classified as moderate or high risk should likely begin exercise in a supervised cardiac rehabilitation program. PA is advised for anyone with PAD.
· Individuals with peripheral neuropathy and without acute ulceration may participate in moderate weight-bearing exercise. Comprehensive foot care including daily inspection of feet and use of proper footwear is recommended for prevention and early detection of sores or ulcers. Moderate walking likely does not increase risk of foot ulcers or reulceration with peripheral neuropathy.
· Individuals with CAN should be screened and receive physician approval and possibly an exercise stress test before exercise initiation. Exercise intensity is best prescribed using the HR reserve method with direct measurement of maximal HR.
· Individuals with uncontrolled proliferative retinopathy should avoid activities that greatly increase intraocular pressure and hemorrhage risk.
· Exercise training increases physical function and QOL in individuals with kidney disease and may even be undertaken during dialysis sessions. The presence of microalbuminuria per se does not necessitate exercise restrictions.
· Efforts to promote PA should focus on developing self-efficacy and fostering social support from family, friends, and health care providers. Encouraging mild or moderate PA may be most beneficial to adoption and maintenance of regular PA participation. Lifestyle interventions may have some efficacy in promoting PA behavior.

Insulin resistance Acute changes in muscular insulin resistance. Most benefits of PA on type 2 diabetes management and prevention are realized through acute and chronic improvements in insulin action (29,46, 116,118,282). The acute effects of a recent bout of exercise account for most of the improvements in insulin action, with most individuals experiencing a decrease in their BG levels during mild- and moderate-intensity exercise and for 2-72 h afterward (24,83,204).
BG reductions are related to the duration and intensity of the exercise, preexercise control, and state of physical training (24,26,47,238). Although previous PA of any intensity generally exerts its effects by enhancing uptake of BG for glycogen synthesis (40,83) and by stimulating fat oxidation and storage in muscle

(21,64,95), more prolonged or intense PA acutely enhances insulin action for longer periods (9,29,75,111,160,238).
Acute improvements in insulin sensitivity in women with type 2 diabetes have been found for equivalent energy expenditures whether engaging in low-intensity or high-intensity walking (29) but may be affected by age and training status (24,75,100,101,228). For example, moderate- to heavy-intensity aerobic training undertaken three times a week for 6 months improved insulin action in both younger and older women but persisted only in the younger group for 72-120 h. Acute changes in liver's ability to process glucose. Increases in liver fat content common in obesity and type 2 diabetes are strongly associated with reduced hepatic and peripheral insulin action. Enhanced whole-body insulin action after

aerobic training seems to be related to gains in peripheral, not hepatic, insulin action (146,282). Such training not resulting in overall weight loss may still reduce hepatic lipid content and alter fat partitioning and use in the liver (128). Evidence statement. PA can result in acute improvements in systemic insulin action lasting from 2 to 72 h. ACSM evidence category A.
CHRONIC EFFECTS OF EXERCISE TRAINING Metabolic control: BG levels and insulin resistance. Aerobic exercise has been the mode traditionally prescribed for diabetes prevention and management. Even 1 week of aerobic training can improve whole-body insulin sensitivity in individuals with type 2 diabetes (282). Moderate and vigorous aerobic training improve in-

Exercise and type 2 diabetes

sulin sensitivity (9,75,83,111), albeit for only a period of hours to days (141), but a lesser intensity may also improve insulin action to some degree (111). Training can enhance the responsiveness of skeletal muscles to insulin with increased expression and/or activity of proteins involved in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling (39,110,204,270). Moderate training may increase glycogen synthase activity and GLUT4 protein expression but not insulin signaling (39). Fat oxidation is also a key aspect of improved insulin action, and training increases lipid storage in muscle and fat oxidation capacity (64,95,136,223).
An individual's training status will affect the use of carbohydrate during an aerobic activity. Aerobic training increases fat utilization during a similar duration bout of low- or moderate-intensity activity done after training, which spares muscle glycogen and BG and results in a lesser acute decrease in BG (28,83,223). Type 2 diabetes may be associated with a decrease in lipid oxidation and shift toward greater carbohydrate oxidation at all exercise intensities (87).
Resistance exercise training also benefits BG control and insulin action in type 2 diabetes (46,65,115,116,118,246). In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), twiceweekly progressive resistance training for 16 weeks by older men with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes resulted in a 46.3% increase in insulin action, a 7.1% reduction in fasting BG levels, and significant loss of visceral fat (116). An increase in muscle mass from resistance training may contribute to BG uptake from a mass effect, and heavy weight training in particular may reverse or prevent further loss of skeletal muscle due to disuse and aging (34,276). In another RCT, all 20 men with type 2 diabetes who participated in either resistance or aerobic exercise thrice weekly for 10 weeks improved their overall BG control, but those doing resistance training had significantly lower A1C values (32). Diabetic women undergoing 12 weeks of low-intensity training with resistance bands had gains in strength and muscle mass and loss of fat mass but had no change in insulin sensitivity (157). Evidence statement. Both aerobic and resistance training improve insulin action, BG control, and fat oxidation and storage in muscle. ACSM evidence category B. Resistance exercise enhances skeletal muscle mass. ACSM evidence category A. Lipids and lipoproteins. Small RCTs involving type 2 diabetes have reported

that aerobic training decreases total and LDL cholesterol and raises HDL cholesterol (130,229). One larger RCT found decreases in total cholesterol with both aerobic and yoga training but no changes in HDL cholesterol or LDL cholesterol (98), although most have found no effect of any form of exercise training on lipids (6,175,178,238,258,267). RCTs designed to increase PA also had no effect on the cholesterol profile in type 2 diabetes, with most also finding no change in triglycerides (6,175,238,258,267). A metaanalysis of training effects on blood lipids in adults with type 2 diabetes found, however, that LDL cholesterol may be reduced by 5% (136).
Lipid profiles may benefit more from concomitant exercise training and weight reduction. Some studies using intensive diet and aerobic exercise interventions reported large reductions in total cholesterol and triglycerides but failed to include controls (12,13). In the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study, intensive lifestyle participants exhibited greater decreases in triglycerides and increases in HDL cholesterol than the control group, while both the intensive lifestyle and usual care groups decreased LDL cholesterol (218). Most lifestyle interventions have been accompanied by an approximate 5-kg weight loss. Evidence statement. Blood lipid responses to training are mixed but may result in a small reduction in LDL cholesterol with no change in HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. Combined weight loss and PA may be more effective than aerobic exercise training alone on lipids. ACSM evidence category C. Hypertension. Hypertension is a common comorbidity affecting more than 60% of individuals with type 2 diabetes (201,249). The risk of vascular complications in hypertensive individuals with type 2 diabetes is 66 -100% higher than with either condition alone (103,195). Both aerobic and resistance training can lower BP in nondiabetic individuals, with slightly greater effects observed with the former (49,134,135,137). Most observational studies show that both exercises lower BP in diabetic individuals (35, 46,78,208,267). Several RCTs have shown reductions in systolic BP (4 - 8 mmHg), but only one reported a slightly lower diastolic BP (11,130,140,176). The Look AHEAD trial found reductions in both systolic and diastolic BP with exercise and weight loss (218), but several studies have reported no changes in BP with training in type 2 diabetes

(175,238,283). Carefully designed RCTs using increasing levels of PA also failed to show any change in BP despite substantially increased PA (6,258). Evidence statement. Aerobic training may slightly reduce systolic BP, but reductions in diastolic BP are less common, in individuals with type 2 diabetes. ACSM evidence category C. Mortality and CV risk. Higher levels of physical fitness and PA are associated with lower CV risk and mortality in both healthy and clinical populations (19, 153,164,207). Increases in PA and physical fitness are also associated with reduced early mortality in both populations as well (19,42,153,163,164,186,272). All-cause and CV mortality risk was 1.7- 6.6 times higher in low-fit compared with high-fit men with type 2 diabetes, with the fittest men exhibiting the lowest risk (42,43). A work capacity 10 METs (where 1 MET is defined as the equivalent of resting metabolic rate) carries the lowest risk, independent of obesity (42,153,186). No RCT data on the effects of changes in physical fitness on mortality in diabetes exist. Evidence statement. Observational studies suggest that greater PA and fitness are associated with a lower risk of allcause and CV mortality. ACSM evidence category C. Body weight: maintenance and loss. The most successful programs for longterm weight control have involved combinations of diet, exercise, and behavior modification (281). Exercise interventions undertaken with volumes typically recommended to improve BG control and reduce CVD risk (e.g., 150 min/week of brisk walking) are usually insufficient for major weight loss (24), likely because obese and older people frequently have difficulty performing sufficient exercise to create a large energy deficit and can easily counterbalance expenditures by eating more (281). However, in RCTs, about 1 h of daily moderate aerobic exercise produces at least as much fat loss as equivalent caloric restriction, with resultant greater insulin action (231,232).
The optimal volume of exercise to achieve sustained major weight loss is probably much larger than the amount required to achieve improved BG control and CV health (24,217). In observational studies (234,235,274), individuals who successfully maintained large weight loss during at least a year typically engaged in 7 h/week of moderate- to vigorousintensity exercise (62). Two RCTs found

e152

Colberg and Associates

that higher exercise volumes (2,000 and 2,500 kcal/week) produced greater and more sustained weight loss than 1,000 kcal/week of exercise (123,124). Evidence statement. Recommended levels of PA may help produce weight loss. However, up to 60 min/day may be required when relying on exercise alone for weight loss. ACSM evidence category C. Supervision of training. Exercise intervention studies showing the greatest effect on BG control have all involved supervision of exercise sessions by qualified exercise trainers (34,65,196,238). The most direct test of the incremental benefits of supervised training was the Italian Diabetes and Exercise Study (11). In this 1-year trial, all 606 participants with type 2 diabetes (both intervention and control) received high-quality exercise counseling that increased self-reported PA substantially. The intervention group also received supervised, facility-based combined aerobic and resistance exercise training twice weekly, resulting in greater improvements in overall BG control, BP, BMI, waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, and estimated 10-year CVD risk. A recent systematic review of 20 resistance training studies on type 2 diabetes (97) found that supervised training of varying volume, frequency, and intensity improved BG control and insulin sensitivity, but that when supervision was removed, compliance and BG control both deteriorated. Evidence statement. Individuals with type 2 diabetes engaged in supervised training exhibit greater compliance and BG control than those undertaking exercise training without supervision. ACSM evidence category B. Psychological effects. Exercise likely has psychological benefits for persons with type 2 diabetes, although evidence for acute and chronic psychological benefits is limited. In the Look AHEAD trial, participants in the intensive lifestyle intervention attempted to lose more than 7% of their initial weight and increase moderately intense PA to greater than 175 min/week. They had improvements in health-related (SF-36 physical component scores) quality of life (QOL) and depression symptoms after 12 months that were mediated by enhanced physical fitness (280).
However, it seems that individuals who undertake exercise to prevent a chronic disease fare better than those who undertake it to manage an existing one. A recent meta-analysis found that while

psychological well-being was significantly improved among individuals who exercised for disease prevention, it deteriorated significantly when undertaken for management of CVD, end-stage renal disease, pulmonary disease, neurological disorders, and cancer (90). These findings suggest that benefits may vary, with those with fewer existing complications benefiting the most.
Meta-analyses of clinically depressed men and women of all age-groups found substantial decreases in depressive symptoms after both short and long courses of exercise (50) and clinical depression and depressive symptoms among the aged (243). Potential mechanisms of exercise include psychological factors, such as increased self-efficacy, a sense of mastery, distraction, and changes in self-concept, as well as physiological factors such as increased central norepinephrine transmission, changes in the hypothalamic adrenocortical system (63), serotonin synthesis and metabolism (61), and endorphins. Regular PA may improve psychological well-being, health-related QOL, and depression in individuals with type 2 diabetes, among whom depression is more common than in the general population (73). Evidence statement. Increased PA and physical fitness can reduce symptoms of depression and improve health-related QOL in those with type 2 diabetes. ACSM evidence category B.
PA AND PREVENTION OF TYPE 2 DIABETES -- Participation in regular PA improves BG control and can prevent or delay onset of type 2 diabetes (64,104,149,158, 170,260). Prospective cohort and cross-sectional observational studies that assessed PA with questionnaires showed that higher PA levels are associated with reduced risk for type 2 diabetes, regardless of method of activity assessment, ranges of activity categories, and statistical methods (108,113,182). Both moderate walking and vigorous activity have been associated with a decreased risk, and greater volumes of PA may provide the most prevention (113). Observational studies have reported that greater fitness is associated with a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes (251,273), even if only moderate-intensity exercise is undertaken.
The Da Qing study in China (211) included an exercise-only treatment arm and reported that even modest changes in exercise (20 min of mild or moderate, 10

min of strenuous, or 5 min of very strenuous exercise one to two times a day) reduced diabetes risk by 46% (compared with 42% for diet plus exercise and 31% for diet alone). The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (74,260) and the U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) (149) included intensive, lifestyle modifications with both diet and increased PA. In the former, 522 middle-aged, overweight adults with IGT completed either lifestyle modifications of at least 30 min of daily, moderate PA, or no change in behavior (74,260). The DPP randomized 3,234 men and women with IGT or IFG into control, medication (metformin), or lifestyle modification groups, composed of dietary and weight loss goals and 150 min of weekly aerobic activity (149). Lifestyle modification in both studies reduced incident diabetes by 58% and, in the DPP, had a greater effect than metformin (31%). Weight loss was the dominant predictor of a lower incidence, but increased PA reduced risk of type 2 diabetes even when weight loss goals were not achieved (104,158,173). PA seems to play a role in preventing type 2 diabetes across ethnic groups and in both sexes (154,224).
Data show that moderate exercise such as brisk walking reduces risk of type 2 diabetes (108,113,114,154,224), and all studies support the current recommendation of 2.5 h/week of a moderate aerobic activity or typically 30 min/day for 5 days/week for prevention. A metaanalysis of 10 cohort studies (125) that assessed the preventive effects of moderate-intensity PA found that risk reduction for type 2 diabetes was 0.70 (0.58 - 0.84) for walking on a regular basis (typically briskly for 2.5 h/week). The preventive effects of resistance training have not been studied.
Type 2 diabetes is also increasing in prevalence in children and adolescents, with increasingly sedentary behavior and obesity as key contributors. No RCTs have been completed that address whether PA or exercise prevents type 2 diabetes in youth. However, limited studies suggest that, to prevent and manage type 2 diabetes, goals for youth should include limiting daily screen time (television, computer, or video game) to less than 60 min/day and doing at least 60 min/day of PA (188). A multicenter trial (the TODAY study) is currently underway to assess the role of PA as part of a behavioral lifestyle intervention aimed at preventing type 2 diabetes in youth (254).

Exercise and type 2 diabetes

Evidence statement. At least 2.5 h/week of moderate to vigorous PA should be undertaken as part of lifestyle changes to prevent type 2 diabetes onset in high-risk adults. ACSM evidence category A. ADA A level recommendation.
PA AND PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF GDM -- As the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise worldwide, it becomes increasingly important to identify high-risk populations and to implement strategies to delay or prevent diabetes onset. Women diagnosed with GDM are at substantially increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes; therefore, PA may be considered a tool to prevent both GDM and possibly type 2 diabetes at a later date (70). Prepregnancy PA has been consistently associated with a reduced risk of GDM (57,58,69,206, 290). Studies during pregnancy are sparse, with only one case-control study (57), one retrospective study (174), and one study of a cohort of Hispanic women (37) observing significant protective effects of PA, while others have not (58,69,206).
Engaging in 30 min of moderateintensity PA (e.g., brisk walking) during most days of the week (e.g., 2.5 h/week) has been adopted as a recommendation for pregnant women without medical or obstetrical complications (222). However, few primary prevention studies have examined whether making a change in PA reduces risk of developing GDM. In 2006, a meta-analysis reviewed four RCTs on GDM in which pregnant women in their third trimester exercised on a cycle or arm ergometer or performed resistance training three times a week for 20 - 45 min compared with doing no specific program (36). The women involved in exercise had better BG control, lower fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations, and improved cardiorespiratory fitness, although frequency of prescription of insulin to control BG did not differ from nonexercisers, and pregnancy outcomes were unchanged. Evidence statement. Epidemiological studies suggest that higher levels of PA may reduce risk of developing GDM during pregnancy. ACSM evidence category C. RCTs suggest that moderate exercise may lower maternal BG levels in GDM. ACSM evidence category B.
PREEXERCISE EVALUATION -- Safe exercise participation can be complicated by the presence of diabetes-related health complications such as CVD, hypertension, neuropathy, or microvascular

changes (239). For individuals desiring to participate in low-intensity PA such as walking, health care providers should use clinical judgment in deciding whether to recommend preexercise testing (3). Conducting exercise stress testing before walking is unnecessary. No evidence suggests that it is routinely necessary as a CVD diagnostic tool, and requiring it may create barriers to participation.
For exercise more vigorous than brisk walking or exceeding the demands of everyday living, sedentary and older diabetic individuals will likely benefit from being assessed for conditions that might be associated with risk of CVD, contraindicate certain activities, or predispose to injuries, including severe peripheral neuropathy, severe autonomic neuropathy, and preproliferative or proliferative retinopathy (240). Before undertaking new higher-intensity PA, they are advised to undergo a detailed medical evaluation and screening for BG control, physical limitations, medications, and macrovascular and microvascular complications (3).
This assessment may include a graded exercise test depending on the age of the person, diabetes duration, and the presence of additional CVD risk factors (3,240). The prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) is greater in individuals with type 2 diabetes (72,155), and maximal graded exercise testing can identify a small proportion of asymptomatic persons with severe coronary artery obstruction (52).
Most young individuals with a low CAD risk may not benefit from preexercise stress testing. In the Look AHEAD trial, although exercise-induced abnormalities were present in 1,303 (22.5%) participants, only older age was associated with increased prevalence of all abnormalities during maximal testing (52). A systematic review of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that stress testing should not be routinely recommended to detect ischemia in asymptomatic individuals with a low CAD risk (10% risk of a cardiac event more than 10 years) because the risks from invasive testing done after a falsepositive test outweigh the benefits of its detection (79,262). The lower the CAD risk, the higher the chance of a false positive (79,248).
Current guidelines attempt to avoid automatic inclusion of lower-risk individuals with type 2 diabetes, stating that exercise stress testing is advised primarily

for previously sedentary individuals with diabetes who want to undertake activity more intense than brisk walking. The goal is to more effectively target individuals at higher risk for underlying CVD (239). The UKPDS Risk Engine (http://www. dtu.ox. ac.uk/riskengine/download.htm) (248) can also be used to calculate expected 10-year CV risk based on age, sex, smoking, A1C, diabetes duration, lipids, BP, and race.
In general, electrocardiogram (ECG) stress testing may be indicated for individuals matching one or more of these criteria:  Age 40 years, with or without CVD
risk factors other than diabetes  Age 30 years and
 Type 1 or type 2 diabetes of 10 years in duration
 Hypertension  Cigarette smoking  Dyslipidemia  Proliferative or preproliferative reti-
nopathy  Nephropathy including microalbu-
minuria  Any of the following, regardless of age
 Known or suspected CAD, cerebrovascular disease, and/or peripheral artery disease (PAD)
 Autonomic neuropathy  Advanced nephropathy with renal
failure
Use of these criteria does not exclude the possibility of conducting ECG stress testing on individuals with a low CAD risk or those who planning to engage in less intense exercise (248). In the absence of contraindications to maximal stress testing, it can still be considered for anyone with type 2 diabetes. Although clinical evidence does not definitively determine who should undergo such testing, potential benefits should be weighed against the risk associated with unnecessary procedures for each individual (155,239).
In individuals with positive or nonspecific ECG changes in response to exercise, or with nonspecific ST- and T-wave changes at rest, follow-up testing may be performed (236). However, the DIAD trial involving 1,123 individuals with type 2 diabetes and no symptoms of CAD found that screening with adenosinestress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging for myocardial ischemia more than 4.8 years did not alter rates of cardiac events (288); thus, the cost-effectiveness and diagnostic value of more intensive testing remains in question.

There is no evidence available to determine whether preexercise evaluation involving stress testing is necessary or beneficial before participation in anaerobic or resistance training. At present, most testing centers are equipped for maximal stress testing but not for an alternate form of testing involving resistance exercise. Moreover, coronary ischemia is less likely to occur during resistance compared with aerobic exercise eliciting the same heart rate (HR), and some doubt exists as to whether resistance exercise induces ischemia (77,88). A review of 12 studies of resistance exercise in men with known CAD found no angina, ST depression, abnormal hemodynamics, ventricular dysrhythmias, or other complications during such exercise (275). Evidence statement. Before undertaking exercise more intense than brisk walking, sedentary persons with type 2 diabetes will likely benefit from an evaluation by a physician. ECG exercise stress testing for asymptomatic individuals at low risk of CAD is not recommended but may be indicated for higher risk. ACSM evidence category C. ADA C level recommendation.
RECOMMENDED PA PARTICIPATION FOR PERSONS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES -- Just 39% of adults with diabetes are physically active compared with 58% of other American adults (193). However, for most people with type 2 diabetes, exercise is recommended for diabetes management and can be undertaken safely and effectively.
Aerobic exercise training Frequency. Aerobic exercise should be performed at least 3 days/week with no more than 2 consecutive days between bouts of activity because of the transient nature of exercise-induced improvements in insulin action (26,141). Most clinical trials evaluating exercise interventions in type 2 diabetes have used a frequency of three times per week (24,238,246,255), but current guidelines for adults generally recommend five sessions of moderate activity (105,202,217). Intensity. Aerobic exercise should be at least at moderate intensity, corresponding approximately to 40 - 60% of VO2max (maximal aerobic capacity). For most people with type 2 diabetes, brisk walking is a moderate-intensity exercise. Additional benefits may be gained from vigorous exercise (60% of VO2max). A meta-

analysis (25) showed that exercise intensity predicts improvements in overall BG control to a greater extent than exercise volume, suggesting that those already exercising at a moderate intensity should consider undertaking some vigorous PA to obtain additional BG (and likely CV) benefits. Duration. Individuals with type 2 diabetes should engage in a minimum of 150 min/week of exercise undertaken at moderate intensity or greater. Aerobic activity should be performed in bouts of at least 10 min and be spread throughout the week. Around 150 min/week of moderate-intensity exercise is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality in observational studies in all populations (217). The average weekly duration in meta-analyses of exercise interventions in type 2 diabetes (24,246,255), including higher-intensity aerobic exercise (196), has been in a similar range. Recent joint ACSM/American Heart Association guidelines (105,202) recommended 150 min of moderate activity (30 min, 5 days/ week) or 60 min of vigorous PA (20 min on 3 days) for all adults, whereas recent U.S. federal guidelines (217) recommended 150 min of moderate or 75 min of vigorous activity, or an equivalent combination, spread throughout each week.
The U.S. federal guidelines (217) suggest that an exercise volume of 500 - 1,000 MET  min/week (MET equivalent of PA  number of minutes) is optimal and can be achieved, for example, with 150 min/week of walking at 6.4 km/h (4 mph; intensity of 5 METs) or 75 min of jogging at 9.6 km/h (6 mph; 10 METs). Unfortunately, most people with type 2 diabetes do not have sufficient aerobic capacity to jog at 9.6 km/h for that weekly duration, and they may have orthopedic or other limitations. In a meta-analysis, the mean maximal aerobic capacity in diabetic individuals was only 22.4 ml/kg/ min, or 6.4 METs (25), making 4.8 METs (75% of maximal) the highest sustainable intensity. Therefore, most diabetic individuals will require at least 150 min of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise per week to achieve optimal CVD risk reduction. Some CV and BG benefits may be gained from lower exercise volumes (a minimum dose has not been established), whereas further benefit likely results from engaging in durations beyond recommended amounts. Individuals with higher aerobic capacities (10 METs) may be able to exercise at a higher abso-

lute intensity for less time and achieve the same benefits. Mode. Any form of aerobic exercise (including brisk walking) that uses large muscle groups and causes sustained increases in HR is likely to be beneficial (114), and undertaking a variety of modes of PA is recommended (217). Rate of progression. At present, no study on individuals with type 2 diabetes has compared rates of progression in exercise intensity or volume. Gradual progression of both is advisable to minimize the risk of injury, particularly if health complications are present, and to enhance compliance. Body weight loss and maintenance. The most successful weight control programs involve combinations of exercise, diet, and behavior modification. People who successfully maintain a large weight loss report exercising about 7 h/week (62,212,234,235,274). Evidence statement. Persons with type 2 diabetes should undertake at least 150 min/week of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise spread out during at least 3 days during the week, with no more than 2 consecutive days between bouts of aerobic activity. ACSM evidence category B. ADA B level recommendation.
Resistance exercise training Frequency. Resistance exercise should be undertaken at least twice weekly on nonconsecutive days (1,105,202,217, 239,240), but more ideally three times a week (65,246), as part of a PA program for individuals with type 2 diabetes, along with regular aerobic activities. Intensity. Training should be moderate (50% of 1-repetition maximum [1-RM]) or vigorous (75- 80% of 1-RM) for optimal gains in strength and insulin action (1,97,239,240,263). Home-based resistance training following supervised, gymbased training may be less effective for maintaining BG control but adequate for maintaining muscle mass and strength (66). Duration. Each training session should minimally include 5-10 exercises involving the major muscle groups (in the upper body, lower body, and core) and involve completion of 10 -15 repetitions to near fatigue per set early in training (1, 97,239,240,263), progressing over time to heavier weights (or resistance) that can be lifted only 8-10 times. A minimum of one set of repetitions to near fatigue, but as many as three to four sets, is recommended for optimal strength gains.

Exercise and type 2 diabetes

Mode. Resistance machines and free weights (e.g., dumbbells and barbells) can result in fairly equivalent gains in strength and mass of targeted muscles (66). Heavier weights or resistance may be needed for optimization of insulin action and BG control (276). Rate of progression. To avoid injury, progression of intensity, frequency, and duration of training sessions should occur slowly. In most progressive training, increases in weight or resistance are undertaken first and only once when the target number of repetitions per set can consistently be exceeded, followed by a greater number of sets and lastly by increased training frequency. Progression for 6 months to thrice-weekly sessions of three sets of 8 -10 repetitions done at 75 to 80% of 1-RM on 8 -10 exercises may be an optimal goal (65). Evidence statement. In addition to aerobic training, persons with type 2 diabetes should undertake moderate to vigorous resistance training at least 2-3 days/week. ACSM evidence category B. ADA B level recommendation.
Supervised training Initial instruction and periodic supervision by a qualified exercise trainer is recommended for most persons with type 2 diabetes, particularly if they undertake resistance exercise training, to ensure optimal benefits to BG control, BP, lipids, and CV risk and to minimize injury risk (11).
Combined aerobic and resistance and other types of training Inclusion of both aerobic and resistance exercise training is recommended. Combined training thrice weekly in individuals with type 2 diabetes may be of greater benefit to BG control than either aerobic or resistance exercise alone (238). However, the total duration of exercise and caloric expenditure was greatest with combined training in all studies done to date (51,183,238), and both types of training were undertaken together on the same days. No studies have yet reported whether daily, but alternating, training is more effective or the BG effect of isocaloric combinations of training. Milder forms of PA, such as yoga and tai chi, may benefit control of BG (98,117,269, 286,291), although their inclusion is not supported conclusively at this time.

Daily movement (unstructured activity) Individuals with type 2 diabetes are encouraged to increase their total daily, unstructured PA to gain additional health benefits. Nonexercise activity thermogenesis (i.e., energy expending for activities of daily living) can create a large daily caloric deficit to prevent excessive weight gain (168,169). In an observational study, obese individuals sat for about 2.5 h more and walked an average of 3.5 miles/day or less than their lean counterparts do. Most of the lean subjects' greater activity came from walks of short duration (15 min) and low velocity (1 mph) (168).
Moreover, use of objective measures such as step counters may enhance reaching daily goals. A meta-analysis of 26 studies with a total of 2,767 (primarily nondiabetic) participants (8 RCTs and 18 observational studies) found that pedometer users increased PA by 26.9% over baseline in studies having an average intervention of 18 weeks (30). An important predictor of increased PA was the use of a goal, such as to take 10,000 steps per day (30).
Flexibility training Flexibility training may be included as part of a PA program, although it should not substitute for other training. Older adults are advised to undertake exercises that maintain or improve balance (202,217), which may include some flexibility training, particularly for many older individuals with type 2 diabetes with a higher risk of falling (194). Although flexibility exercise (stretching) has frequently been recommended as a means of increasing joint range of motion (ROM) and reducing risk of injury, two systematic reviews found that flexibility exercise does not reduce risk of exerciseinduced injury (237,287). A small RCT found that ROM exercises modestly decreased peak plantar pressures (94), but no study has directly evaluated whether such training reduces risk of ulceration or injury in type 2 diabetes. However, flexibility exercise combined with resistance training can increase ROM in individuals with type 2 diabetes (109) and allow individuals to more easily engage in activities that require greater ROM around joints. Evidence statement. Supervised and combined aerobic and resistance training may confer health additional benefits, although milder forms of PA (such as yoga)

have shown mixed results. Persons with type 2 diabetes are encouraged to increase their total daily unstructured PA. Flexibility training may be included but should not be undertaken in place of other recommended types of PA. ACSM evidence category B. ADA C level recommendation.
EXERCISE WITH NONOPTIMAL BG CONTROL Hyperglycemia. While hyperglycemia can be worsened by exercise in type 1 diabetic individuals who are insulin deficient and ketotic (due to missed or insufficient insulin), very few persons with type 2 diabetes develop such a profound degree of insulin deficiency. Therefore, individuals with type 2 diabetes generally do not need to postpone exercise because of high BG, provided that they are feeling well. If they undertake strenuous physical activities with elevated glucose levels (300 mg/dl or 16.7 mmol/l), it is prudent to ensure that they are adequately hydrated (3). If hyperglycemic after a meal, individuals with type 2 diabetes will still likely experience a reduction in BG during aerobic work because endogenous insulin levels will likely be higher at that time (221). Evidence statement. Individuals with type 2 diabetes may engage in PA, using caution when exercising with BG levels exceeding 300 mg/dl (16.7 mmol/l) without ketosis, provided they are feeling well and are adequately hydrated. ACSM evidence category C. ADA E level recommendation. Hypoglycemia: causes and prevention. Of greatest concern to many exercisers is the risk of hypoglycemia. In individuals whose diabetes is being controlled by lifestyle alone, the risk of developing hypoglycemia during exercise is minimal, making stringent measures unnecessary to maintain BG (239). Glucose monitoring can be performed before and after PA to assess its unique effect. Activities of longer duration and lower intensity generally cause a decline in BG levels but not to the level of hypoglycemia (9,29,75,111,160). While very intense activities can cause transient elevations in BG (156,252,253), intermittent highintensity exercise done immediately after breakfast in individuals treated with diet only reduces BG levels and insulin secretion (160).
In insulin or insulin secretagogue users, who frequently have the effects of both exercise and insulin to increase glucose uptake, PA can complicate diabetes

e156

management (138,198,230,293). For preexercise BG levels of less than 100 mg/dl (5.5 mmol/l), ADA recommends that carbohydrate be ingested before any PA (3), but this applies only to individuals taking insulin or the secretagogues more likely to cause hypoglycemia (e.g., sulfonylureas such as glyburide, glipizide, and glimepiride, as well as nateglinide and repaglinide) (161,230). If controlled with diet or other oral medications, most individuals will not need carbohydrate supplements for exercise lasting less than an hour. Insulin users should likely consume up to 15 g of carbohydrate before exercise for an initial BG level of 100 mg/dl or lower, with the actual amount dependent on injected insulin doses, exercise duration and intensity, and results of BG monitoring. Intense, short exercise requires lesser or no carbohydrate intake (156).
Later-onset hypoglycemia is a greater concern when carbohydrate stores (i.e., muscle and liver glycogen) are depleted during an acute bout of exercise. In particular, high-intensity exercise (e.g., repeated interval or intense resistance training) can result in substantial depletion of muscle glycogen, thereby increasing risk for postexercise hypoglycemia in users of insulin or insulin secretagogues (161). In such cases, the consumption of 5-30 g of carbohydrate during and within 30 min after exhaustive, glycogendepleting exercise will lower hypoglycemia risk and allow for more efficient restoration of muscle glycogen (31,247). Evidence statement. Persons with type 2 diabetes not using insulin or insulin secretagogues are unlikely to experience hypoglycemia related to PA. Users of insulin and insulin secretagogues are advised to supplement with carbohydrate as needed to prevent hypoglycemia during and after exercise. ACSM evidence category C. ADA C level recommendation.
MEDICATION EFFECTS ON EXERCISE RESPONSES -- Current treatment strategies promote combination therapies to address the three major defects in type 2 diabetes: impaired peripheral glucose uptake (liver, fat, and muscle), excessive hepatic glucose release (with glucagon excess), and insufficient insulin secretion. Medication adjustments for PA are generally necessary only with use of insulin and other insulin secretagogues (161,230). To prevent hypoglycemia, individuals may need to reduce their oral medications or insulin

dosing before (and possibly after) exercise (83,161). Before planned exercise, shortacting insulin doses will likely have to be reduced to prevent hypoglycemia. Newer, synthetic, rapid-acting insulin analogs (i.e., lispro, aspart, and glulisine) induce more rapid decreases in BG than regular human insulin. Individuals will need to monitor BG levels before, occasionally during, and after exercise and compensate with appropriate dietary and/or medication regimen changes, particularly when exercising at insulin peak times. If only longer-acting insulins such as glargine, detemir, and NPH are being absorbed from subcutaneous depots during PA, exercise-induced hypoglycemia is not as likely (219), although doses may need to be reduced to accommodate regular participation in PA. Doses of select oral hypoglycemic agents (glyburide, glipizide, glimepiride, nateglinide, and repaglinide) may also need to be lowered in response to regular exercise training if the frequency of hypoglycemia increases (161,230).
Diabetic individuals are often prescribed a variety of medications for comorbid conditions, including diuretics, -blockers, ACE inhibitors, aspirin, lipidlowering agents, and more. These medications generally do not affect exercise responses, with some notable exceptions. -Blockers are known to blunt HR responses to exercise and lower maximal exercise capacity to 87% of expected via negative inotropic and chronotropic effects (241). They may also block adrenergic symptoms of hypoglycemia, increasing the risk of undetected hypoglycemia during exercise. However, -blockers may increase exercise capacity in those with CAD, rather than lowering it, by reducing coronary ischemia during activity (53). Diuretics, however, may lower overall blood and fluid volumes resulting in dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, particularly during exercise in the heat. Statin use has been associated with an elevated risk of myopathies (myalgia and myositis), particularly when combined with use of fibrates and niacin (203). An extended discussion on medications can be found in the Handbook of Exercise in Diabetes (2002) (84). Evidence statement. Medication dosage adjustments to prevent exerciseassociated hypoglycemia may be required by individuals using insulin or certain insulin secretagogues. Most other medications prescribed for concomitant health problems do not affect exercise, with the

exception of -blockers, some diuretics, and statins. ACSM evidence category C. ADA C level recommendation.
EXERCISE WITH LONGTERM COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES Vascular disease. Individuals with angina and type 2 diabetes classified as moderate or high risk should preferably exercise in a supervised cardiac rehabilitation program, at least initially (245). Diabetes accelerates the development of atherosclerosis and is a major risk factor for CVD and PAD. Individuals with type 2 diabetes have a lifetime risk of CAD that includes 67% of women and 78% of men and is exacerbated by obesity (22,80,165). Moreover, some individuals who have an acute myocardial infarction may not experience chest pain, and up to a third may have silent myocardial ischemia (45,180).
For individuals with PAD, with and without intermittent claudication and pain in the extremities during PA, low-tomoderate walking, arm-crank, and cycling exercise have all been shown to enhance mobility, functional capacity, exercise pain tolerance, and QOL (214,295). Lower extremity resistance training also improves functional performance measured by treadmill walking, stair climbing ability, and QOL measures (187).
Vascular alterations are common in diabetes, even in the absence of overt vascular disease. Endothelial dysfunction may be an underlying cause of many associated vascular problems (45,54). In addition to traditional risk factors, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and oxidative stress contribute to endothelial damage, leading to poor arterial function and greater susceptibility to atherogenesis (45,82,289). Both aerobic and resistance training can improve endothelial function (46,294), but not all studies have shown posttraining improvement (283). Evidence statement. Known CVD is not an absolute contraindication to exercise. Individuals with angina classified as moderate or high risk should likely begin exercise in a supervised cardiac rehabilitation program. PA is advised for anyone with PAD. ACSM evidence category C. ADA C level recommendation. Peripheral neuropathy. Mild to moderate exercise may help prevent the onset of peripheral neuropathy (10). Individuals without acute foot ulcers can undertake moderate weight-bearing exercise, although anyone with a foot injury or open

Exercise and type 2 diabetes

sore or ulcer should be restricted to non- weight-bearing PA. All individuals should closely examine their feet on a daily basis to prevent and detect sores or ulcers early and follow recommendations for use of proper footwear. Previous guidelines stated that persons with severe peripheral neuropathy should avoid weight-bearing activities to reduce risk of foot ulcerations (102,264). However, recent studies indicated that moderate walking does not increase risk of foot ulcers or reulceration in those with peripheral neuropathy (166,167).
Peripheral neuropathy affects the extremities, particularly the lower legs and feet. Hyperglycemia causes nerve toxicity, leading to nerve damage and apoptosis (242,244), which causes microvascular damage and loss of perfusion. Symptoms manifest as neuropathic pain and/or loss of sensation that, coupled with poor blood flow, increase the risk of foot injuries and ulcerations (45,244). Up to 40% of diabetic individuals may experience peripheral neuropathy, and 60% of lower extremity amputations in Americans are related to diabetes (166,199,216). Evidence statement. Individuals with peripheral neuropathy and without acute ulceration may participate in moderate weight-bearing exercise. Comprehensive foot care including daily inspection of feet and use of proper footwear is recommended for prevention and early detection of sores or ulcers. Moderate walking likely does not increase risk of foot ulcers or reulceration with peripheral neuropathy. ACSM evidence category B. ADA B level recommendation. Autonomic neuropathy. Moderateintensity aerobic training can improve autonomic function in individuals with and without CV autonomic neuropathy (CAN) (112,176,208); however, improvements may only be evident after an acute submaximal exercise (78). Screening for CAN should include a battery of autonomic tests (including HR variability) that evaluate both branches of the autonomic nervous system. Given the likelihood of silent ischemia, HR, and BP abnormalities, individuals with CAN should have physician approval and possibly undergo stress testing to screen for CV abnormalities before commencing exercise (265). Exercise intensity may be accurately prescribed using the HR reserve method (a percentage of the difference between maximal and resting HR, added to the resting value) to approximate oxygen consumption during submaximal exer-

cise with maximal HR directly measured, rather than estimated, for better accuracy (48,265).
Approximately 22% of those with type 2 diabetes have CAN, but most exhibit alterations in autonomic function (292). The presence of CAN doubles the risk of mortality (48,265) and indicates more frequency of silent myocardial ischemia (265), orthostatic hypotension, or resting tachycardia (76,177). CAN also impairs exercise tolerance and lowers maximal HR (131,265). Although both sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunctions can be present, vagal dysfunction usually occurs earlier. Slower HR recovery after PA is associated with mortality risk (38,265). Evidence statement. Individuals with CAN should be screened and receive physician approval and possibly an exercise stress test before exercise initiation. Exercise intensity is best prescribed using the HR reserve method with direct measurement of maximal HR. ACSM evidence category C. ADA C level recommendation. Retinopathy. In diabetic individuals with proliferative or preproliferative retinopathy or macular degeneration, careful screening and physician approval are recommended before initiating an exercise program. Activities that greatly increase intraocular pressure, such as highintensity aerobic or resistance training (with large increases in systolic BP) and head-down activities, are not advised with uncontrolled proliferative disease, nor are jumping or jarring activities, all of which increase hemorrhage risk (1). Diabetic retinopathy is the main cause of blindness in developed countries and is associated with increased CV mortality (129,147). Individuals with retinopathy may receive some benefits, such as improved work capacity, after low- to moderate-intensity exercise training (16,17). While PA has been shown to be protective against development of age-related macular degeneration (150), very little research exists in type 2 diabetes. Evidence statement. Individuals with uncontrolled proliferative retinopathy should avoid activities that greatly increase intraocular pressure and hemorrhage risk. ACSM evidence category D. ADA E level recommendation. Nephropathy and microalbuminuria. Both aerobic and resistance training improve physical function and QOL in individuals with kidney disease (126,209, 210), although BP increases during PA may transiently elevate levels of mi-

croalbumin in urine. Resistance exercise training is especially effective in improving muscle function and activities of daily living, which are normally severely affected by later-stage kidney disease (126). Before initiation of PA, individuals with overt nephropathy should be carefully screened, have physician approval, and possibly undergo stress testing to detect CAD and abnormal HR and BP responses (1,27). Exercise should be begun at a low intensity and volume because aerobic capacity and muscle function are substantially reduced, and avoidance of the Valsava maneuver or high-intensity exercise to prevent excessive increases in BP is advised (1). Supervised, moderate aerobic exercise undertaken during dialysis sessions, however, has been shown to be effective as home-based exercise and may improve compliance (126,151).
Diabetic nephropathy develops in 30% of individuals with diabetes and is a major risk factor for death in those with diabetes (20,45). Microalbuminuria, or minute amounts of albumin in the urine, is common and a risk factor for overt nephropathy (45) and CV mortality (91). Tight BG and BP control may delay progression of microalbuminuria (127,148), along with exercise and dietary changes (81,162). Exercise training delays the progression of diabetic nephropathy in animals (89,259), but few evidence is available in humans. Evidence statement. Exercise training increases physical function and QOL in individuals with kidney disease and may even be undertaken during dialysis sessions. The presence of microalbuminuria per se does not necessitate exercise restrictions. ACSM evidence category C. ADA C level recommendation.
ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF EXERCISE BY PERSONS WITH DIABETES -- Most American adults with type 2 diabetes or at highest risk for developing it do not engage in regular PA; their rate of participation is significantly below national norms (193). Additional strategies are needed to increase the adoption and maintenance of PA.
One of the most consistent predictors of greater levels of activity has been higher levels of self-efficacy (2,55,68), which reflect confidence in the ability to exercise (185). Social support has also been associated with greater levels of PA (93, 190,215), supporting the role of social networks in the spread of obesity (41).

Fortunately, those same social dynamics may be exploited to increase the effects of interventions beyond the "target" individual (8,99) and potentially can help spread PA behavior. Counseling delivered by health care professionals may be a meaningful source of support and effective source for delivery (7,144). Physicians vary in counseling their patients to exercise: on average, advice or referral related to exercise occurred at 18% of office visits among diabetic patients (213), and 73% of patients reported receiving advice at some point to exercise more (192). The availability of facilities or pleasant and safe places to walk may also be important predictors of regular PA (59).
When prescribing PA for the prevention or control of type 2 diabetes, the effects of the dose of the prescription on adherence are small (225). Therefore, practitioners are encouraged to use factors such as choice and enjoyment in helping determine specifically how an individual would meet recommended participation. Affective responses to exercise may be important predictors of adoption and maintenance, and encouraging activity at intensities below the ventilatory threshold may be most beneficial (172,277,278). Many individuals with, or at risk of developing, type 2 diabetes prefer walking as an aerobic activity (190), and pedometer-based interventions can be effective for increasing aerobic activity (30,205,258). Finally, the emerging importance of sedentary behaviors in determining metabolic risk (106,107) suggests that future interventions may also benefit from attempting to decrease sitting time and periods of extended sedentary activity.
Large-scale trials such as the DPP and Look AHEAD provide some insight into successful lifestyle interventions that help promote PA by incorporating goal setting, self-monitoring, frequent contact, and stepped-care protocols (56,60,71,266). Delivering these programs requires extensive access to resources, staff, and space, although they are cost-effective overall (121,122).
These large studies are multifactorial, targeting several behaviors that include PA, but include multiple behavior interventions that also require changes in diet and focusing on weight loss or management (179). Therefore, strategies for PA intervention in weight management are highly relevant to this population (62). Fewer RCTs solely targeted PA behavior in individuals with or at risk of develop-

ing type 2 diabetes (279,284,285). The results have been mixed, with some showing increased PA (67,120,145,171) and others showing no effect (142,143,189). Effective short-term programs have used print (67), phone (44,144,233), in-person (120,139), or Internet (92,171) delivery. Long-term effectiveness of such interventions has not been assessed (197). Evidence statement. Efforts to promote PA should focus on developing selfefficacy and fostering social support from family, friends, and health care providers. Encouraging mild or moderate PA may be most beneficial to adoption and maintenance of regular PA participation. Lifestyle interventions may have some efficacy in promoting PA behavior. ACSM evidence category B. ADA B level recommendation.
CONCLUSIONS -- Exercise plays a major role in the prevention and control of insulin resistance, prediabetes, GDM, type 2 diabetes, and diabetes-related health complications. Both aerobic and resistance training improve insulin action, at least acutely, and can assist with the management of BG levels, lipids, BP, CV risk, mortality, and QOL, but exercise must be undertaken regularly to have continued benefits and likely include regular training of varying types. Most persons with type 2 diabetes can perform exercise safely as long as certain precautions are taken. The inclusion of an exercise program or other means of increasing overall PA is critical for optimal health in individuals with type 2 diabetes.
